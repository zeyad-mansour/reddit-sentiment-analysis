I got the vivitrol shot last week but I got drunk on Saturday when visiting a cousin on a road trip with our other cousin. Drinking tonight on the way back in her husbands childhood home, making us stop so I can do a zoom meeting and barely get anything done for work. This is madness. I’m inches away from losing this job, they’ve extended all of their graces to me. I let my daughter go live with her dad, my boyfriend is enabling to me at times, but is losing his patience. I don’t know if I can pull myself out of this one, maybe I should just go to treatment. It would be my second inpatient. I almost went last week but was worried about my boyfriend bc we were hosting thanksgiving. Who am I??",10

I confessed my feelings to a girl once during a bender. To make matters worse, I don't remember that I did (Note: we don't speak anymore which is fair on her part). Basically, I also don't like who I become when I'm under the influence of alcohol.

Recently, I've noticed my hangovers have been a terrible experience and are gradually getting worse as time progresses. I am having trouble sleeping most notably on the Sunday after the Friday/Saturday binge. I can feel my heart beating in my chest, not fast, but strong and heavy like it's going to burst through my ribcage. Not to mention, the overwhelming shroud of 'hang-xiety' that comes with it.

I managed to be sober for a large part of 2021 with the thought of staying quit but eventually succumbed to peer pressure. I was going to do jump back in 2022 starting new year but I don't want to wait anymore. I mean, I feel like sh\*t as I type this so might as well start now.

I don't really have a question. Just needed a place to rant. Whenever I bring this up with my friends/family they say ""just drink in moderation"" or that I'm ""being dramatic since I'm not really an alcoholic"". And while moderation may work in the short term, I just slip back to slamming drinks in no time.",16

Man oh man did a shower beer sound good. But then I thought, why can’t I still give myself the treat of a cold one in the shower without the booze? 

I took a blazing hot shower and it was so cathartic to be rinsed clean in steamy water with just one cold hand holding a sweaty canned lacroix. And the dehydrating feeling of a shower coupled with the intense bubbles of a sparkling water being gulped down?! I was absolutely jazzed. Why did I think beer needed to be involved for this to be fun? 

And instead of getting out of the shower feeling fat and dizzy I truly feel brand new. Hydrated fresh and without guilt.

It almost seems like it would have been easier to succeed if I had a worse drinking problem (I know it wouldn't actually be and no disrespect to those who have had severe struggles) because so many people around me, while not unsupportive, just seemed confused. Like because I didn't appear to be an alcoholic, not drinking was weird and unnecessary. I started doubting that I had been drinking too much, when I know very well that I didn't feel well. Why does our society see drinking literal poison as a necessity? Or on the opposite extreme (like my upbringing) see it as an express ticket to hell?

Thankful to be alcohol-free 😎️","At some point over the weekend my family was talking about whether petty crimes were really getting more or less frequent in the area; someone mentioned people stealing catalytic converters.

Well, this morning, fiancee starts her car to go to work and vroooooomm that mother flipper is roaring. Well I wasn't there but she sent me a recording of it because I was already gone and she thought it was a little weird.

I don't know shit about cars. About the only non-trivial knowledge I have is from the time I was drunk in college, borrowed my friend's van, and knocked off the catalytic converter by running over a boulder.

So I texted back, ""Man we were just talking about people stealing catalytic converters... That's what it sounds like when one is missing."" We later confirmed that at a shop.

That's ridiculous, right? Someone stole that part, possibly on the same night we were talking about people stealing that kind of part. (We don't know which night because we didn't use the car for a few days.)

So you already know what I'm doing tonight: not drinking with you! Aww yeah baby. We'll get that part replaced for a few hundred stupid dollars that we would've preferred to save, and move on with our silly lives.

I've always been unable to control how much I drink but it's never been an issue. 1=100 but pre covid it was only weekends and at the bars with friends. I would spend a day hungover and be back on my feet by Monday. This past year my hangovers are no longer hangovers because my drinking has escalated so much. In September (my 27th birthday) I took a week off and went on a 10 day bender and wow was that three days of hell trying to recover, after the first day it was so bad I asked my girlfriend to take me to the ER because I couldn't keep anything down. They pumped me full of fluids and whatever else and sent me home to suffer. That kept me sober for 30 full days.

 I decided to celebrate by having a few beers and watch the game still thinking I could moderate and that birthday week was just a one off bad binge. Well two beers turned into 5 bottles of vodka plus beers and I was back on my couch immobilized after a few days. I went to a walk in clinic because my stomach pain was so bad I thought I had done some permanent damage. They gave me Pantoprazole and I stopped again for 30 days. Well roll over to last week I was working from home and decided to try moderation again (because ""I don't have a problem"" . Starting Monday and by Thursday my girlfriend was calling me trying to get ahold of me because she was worried (I was blacked out and don't even Remember what happened between Monday night and Thursday night). I called my dad who's 5 years sober and told him I think I have a problem. He came over with my girlfriend and we had an honest talk about what I'm doing to myself and why. He took me to the ER where again they put me on fluids and gave me ativan because they were worried about my withdrawals. I was discharged that afternoon with a very small script for valium (which is a God send) and more Pantoprazole. I have spent the last 3 days ""dying"" at home. Sunday my dad took me to my first AA meeting which the thought of scares the s#6% out of me, because it makes this real, but I did it. 


Today I felt good enough (not great but good enough) to go to work. And at 80 hours I'm starting to feel like a human again.

I wanted to share that I've hit my rock bottom and I realize that alcohol has lied to me, and always will. This last weekend I've never felt withdrawal that made me feel that horrible. So this is it. I have scheduled a meeting with a therapist tomorrow and will continue to join my father going to meetings. I'm admitting and accepting I have a problem and can't do this alone.

If being regularly jolted awake by the tormented screams of inmates in neighboring cells wasn’t bad enough, there was the fact that I was sharing a cell designed for a single inmate with three other people. We were crowded four deep in a tiny cell, and there was no escaping the smell. To call it unpleasant would be putting it lightly. It was overpowering.

As my eyes adjusted to the light, I looked at the bottom of the bunk above me. On it was a hurricane of words… angry, unstable words, scratched into the metal bed frame by those who had been there before me. The words sounded a lot like the things that many of the people around me uttered every day. This was an insane place, and for the time being, it was home.

In that moment, my mind jumped back once again to the decisions that had brought me here, and the people who had been hurt because of my choices. I said to myself, “You had so many loving people in your life, but this time you’ve lost them. You had every good thing that anyone could ask for, and you threw it all away because of your actions.” I thought about the person I had become and the downward spiral I had traveled for so long. I thought to myself, “How did I get here?”

I got started down the road to substance use in middle school for a few reasons. I was a scared, awkward kid who desperately wanted to be liked, but didn’t quite fit the mold that everyone else was in. I was definitely different, and not always in a way that was seen as good. I wasn’t even remotely comfortable in my own skin. So I thought I’d win my peers’ approval and acceptance by drinking. In addition to that, I was curious to see what it was like. Finally, there were some people I looked up to who had substance use issues of their own, and they seemed completely happy and successful. So, while I had been told about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, what I had seen conveyed a very different message.

The first time I drank, one of the worst things that could have possibly happened did happen: nothing. I don’t mean that the alcohol didn’t affect me. I mean that there weren’t any immediate consequences, at least that I could notice. After having been told what drugs and alcohol would do to me, I was anticipating some kind of instant lightning bolt of consequence. When nothing seemed to go wrong, I thought, “There’s no price to pay for this. I just did it and I’m fine. The world didn’t end. They lied to me about this.” I’ve since learned something very important about consequences. There is a consequence for every negative or unhealthy decision we make, but they don’t always happen immediately and we don’t always notice them right away. Sometimes they don’t become apparent until much later, and sometimes they chase you down the road years later.

I noticed that when I drank, everything seemed to get better. My pain seemed to go away. I was dealing with bullying and feeling very out of place in junior high, and when I drank, I quit feeling the sadness from that. It seemed to allow me to finally be comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t realize that the feeling was a lie. When I got into high school, alcohol was a lot easier to get, and I started using it as a way to deal with my problems. My alcohol use became much more frequent and I started drinking larger quantities. I didn’t realize how much worse I was making things for myself. None of it seemed like a big deal at the time. Alcohol then gave way to marijuana, nitrous oxide (Whip-Its), and some initial experimentation with prescription drugs.


By the time I was a freshman in college, I was using marijuana daily and drinking frequently. Later in college I got caught in the web of opiate painkillers after a friend with a prescription gave me some oxycodone. After I started on painkillers, the floodgates opened. The feeling from opiates was a step beyond alcohol in my quest to escape my pain, disintegrating relationship, and my growing dislike for myself. Somehow I miraculously made it through college with a decent GPA and managed to get my degree. I’m still not completely sure how I managed that.

Shortly after college, I got into ecstasy and cocaine. I developed a huge cocaine habit that eventually led me to getting into meth, once the cocaine ceased being effective. Right around the same time, my painkiller addiction led to heroin after it became impossible to get legitimate prescriptions and expensive to buy illicit opiate pharmaceuticals. Alcohol was there all along, in ridiculously excessive quantities. Eventually, I became willing to use just about any substance that happened to cross my path. When someone asked what my drug of choice was, I laughingly quoted the Alice in Chains song “Junkhead.” “What’s my drug of choice? Well, what have you got?”

My life was a mess. I lost jobs due to absenteeism, quit other jobs due to an inability to focus, and eventually stopped trying to get jobs. I drained a $10,000 bank account on my addiction. I had nothing to show for it but increasing health problems. There was alcohol poisoning. There were overdoses. There was one particular overdose involving a combination of cocaine, meth, alcohol, and fentanyl (a powerful synthetic opioid) that was absolutely hellish and insane. To this day, it surprises me that I made it through that one. My behavior was erratic and I became angry and unpredictable. At one point, coke and meth made me a 130lb skeleton. At a later point, alcohol made me a 215lb slug.

This went on for years. I lost my 20’s and the better part of my 30’s. I wanted to stop but was so caught up in it all. I was making all kinds of bad decisions. I’m responsible for my own choices, but addiction and the damaged thinking that comes with it makes it a whole lot easier to make bad choices. Eventually I was no longer using to feel good, but to not feel horrible. I was drinking and using purely out of addiction and the need to avoid withdrawal. Guilt and shame kept me running back to drugs and alcohol, which led to behavior that caused me guilt and shame. It was an endless cycle.

I ended up jobless for a long time, and thousands of dollars in debt. My thinking and brain chemistry were so overwhelmed by the substances to which I was a slave. I came to a point where I hated myself and said, “I’m never coming back from this. I’ve done too much damage. I’m going to ride this train until it crashes.” The last night I drank and used, I went on a rampage. I hurt people who didn’t deserve it, smashed up my own house, and eventually attempted to end my own life. I was arrested and charged with multiple felonies. If I had been convicted of everything I was charged with, I was looking at the possibility of a doing few years in the Arizona Department of Corrections.

That’s what led to me serving time in Durango Jail, part of Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s notorious Maricopa County Jail system. While in jail, I went through hellish withdrawals. The extent of the jail’s acknowledgement of my withdrawal consisted of giving me a bottom bunk, so I would be less likely to get a concussion if my withdrawals led to a seizure that ended up with me falling out of bed. I suffered horrible insomnia and only managed to occasionally sleep for about 15 minutes at a time. It was less like sleeping and more like passing out. I genuinely felt like I was going insane. I went through a combination of the worst physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual pain I’ve ever felt. I genuinely believed that I had lost everyone and everything I loved and cared about. I found myself at a nearly unbearable low point.

I became willing to do anything to repair the damage I had done, but wasn’t sure that such repair would even be possible. While in the midst of this, I somehow found a tiny bit of sanity, which allowed me to make myself a promise to make my faith, my family, and my sobriety my priorities. A fellow inmate named Troy gave me a Bible, which I started reading. It was a welcome escape and was the only thing that gave me any kind of hope in those moments. I latched on to that Higher Power and never let go.

I eventually bailed out while my case was pending, and I moved into a place called the Phoenix Dream Center. It’s a live-in facility where people who have had substance use issues, people who have been in jail and prison, people who have been homeless, former gang members, and victims of human trafficking can move in and get their lives back together. A lot of good growth and healing started for me there, but it wasn’t easy.

In a lot of ways, the Dream Center is harder than jail. Our days started at 4 a.m. and ended at 11 p.m. Every moment was scheduled for us and included intense morning workouts (run by a former pro rugby star), classes, janitorial work, maintenance work, labor, homeless outreach, church, etc. We were run ragged, but the discipline, structure, and purpose were what I (and the others there) needed as part of a successful recovery.

While in the Dream Center, I poured myself back into my faith, which remains a key component of my recovery today. I started communicating again, instead of trying to run from my problems. I made exercise and nutrition a big part of my life. I started creating art and writing again. I started to laugh again. I gained back my self-respect and others’ trust. As a result of the changes that began there, I was able to restore my marriage; something I hoped would happen but didn’t know was possible.

In court, the prosecutor was seeking 90 days of jail time for me, and the Probation Presentence Writer wanted me to do six months. I didn’t want either to happen, as they could delay the good work that had begun in my marriage, and in my growth as a person. I accepted a plea deal. Based on what I said and others said at my sentencing, the judge said that he didn’t see any benefit to me serving additional time. To this day, I am grateful he listened to me and to the others who spoke. I was sentenced to two years supervised probation. I was assigned 46 weeks of one type of counseling and 15 weeks of another. I was given a permanent (“designated”) felony and lost my rights as an American citizen. I paid thousands of dollars in court fines and fees. I was given a 10 p.m. curfew. I was randomly drug tested.

Under really interesting circumstances, I ran into a guy who overheard part of my story and told me I should apply to be a substance use Peer Educator at a local prevention nonprofit called notMYkid. I did. In January of 2013, I started there as a part-time youth Peer Educator and worked as hard as I could. I spoke in schools across Arizona, sharing the experience and knowledge I learned during my journey with students in 6th through 12th grade. I decided to be as open and honest as I could about my past in order to help prevent others from taking the same path. I did everything I was asked to do and took on additional duties. I was relentless and determined in my efforts. Within the first three months, they made me full time. Four months later, I was given a staff position, and became the organization’s first Communications Coordinator.

I was then promoted to Manager of Parent and Faculty Education for the organization and eventually became a Prevention Specialist. I research several behavioral health topics and create presentations for parents, school faculty members, after school program mentors, and camp counselors. I have also recruited, hired, trained, and managed several Parent and Faculty Educators, who are primarily behavioral health professionals and current or former law enforcement officers. I do student/youth presentations on substance use, bullying, and a combination topic of depression, self-injury, and suicide. I do parent and faculty presentations on substance use, bullying, depression/self-injury/suicide, prescription drug misuse, and Internet safety. I also do TV, radio, web, and print interviews as the organization’s representative. I’ve done approximately 80 interviews in the last few years, including live TV appearances in New York, Boston, Dallas, Denver, and Kansas City. Those interviews have included the “Today” show, “Good Day New York,” “Kansas City Live,” NECN Boston, and WFAA Dallas.

I currently travel around Arizona doing speaking engagements, sharing my personal story intertwined with teachable keys to behavioral health. I’ve had the opportunity to share my story with students and government officials in Boston, students and parents in California, and parents in Kansas City. I’ve spoken to groups as small as five people and as large as 1,000. I’ve done as many as seven one-hour presentations back-to-back. I’ve had the chance to address the Pinal County Drug Court, sharing my story and thoughts on the way government and the courts view addiction. I’ve presented at Grand Canyon University, Arizona State University, Paradise Valley Community College, and a number of corporations, Including American Express, Cox, Intel, and Insight. As of November 2021, I’ve done over 600 presentations to an audience of over 150,000 people at more than 200 different venues. Approximately half of my presentations have been given to youth, and the other half to adults.

I also had the opportunity to do interviews for a historic documentary called “Hooked: Tracking Heroin’s Hold on Arizona,” which was simulcast on every TV station (and most radio stations) in Arizona on January 13th, 2015. Additionally, I was appointed to the Recovery and Response Subcommittee responsible for developing, staffing, and overseeing the crisis line phone bank taking calls during and after the airing of the documentary. I also served on the Recovery and Response Subcommittee tasked with overseeing the crisis line response for the sequel documentary called “Hooked Rx,” which aired in early 2017.

In October of 2015, I had the chance to become an ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) trainer. As a registered trainer, I now have the honor of facilitating two-day suicide intervention workshops, and teaching genuinely lifesaving intervention skills to people around the state of Arizona. It has allowed me to combine my personal experience with the topic, and my passion for helping others, with the well-designed material that has become the industry standard (crisis lines, military, fire departments, police departments) for suicide intervention. I have since used my experience and training to help multiple different people who were struggling with thoughts of suicide. The opportunity has been nothing short of a blessing.

Five years ago, I was made co-facilitator on an early intervention program for preteens and teens dealing with mild to moderate substance use issues. About a year into my time with the program, I was made lead facilitator. I now manage the program and continue to facilitate multiple monthly groups in Scottsdale and Tempe. It’s an incredibly positive, non-shaming, non-punitive, educational and inspirational program that has helped hundreds of local families not only get their teens back on a healthy path, but learn to communicate with one another in an intentional, proactive, and respectful way. I get to see families, who sometimes aren’t even speaking to one another at the beginning of the first session, reconnect with one another and rise above the issues that have been challenging them.

In September of 2019, I had the opportunity to begin hosting and producing a weekly podcast called “Win This Year.” The show is focused on prevention, mental health, behavioral health, parenting, and other related topics, and our target audience is primarily parents, grandparents, guardians, and those who work with youth. My goal for the show is to be interesting, informative, and inspiring. I feel like we’ve managed to do that so far. Look for the show on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Alexa/TuneIn, Stitcher, IHeartRadio, and most mainstream podcast outlets.


Most importantly, sobriety has allowed me the opportunity to become the type of husband I should have been all along and has given me the chance to be a very good dad to an amazing daughter who was born shortly after my one-year sober date. I give thanks every day for the fact that I got clean and sober before having a child. I owe it to her and my wife to have my act together. Every moment with my daughter is a gift that I never thought I would get. If you had told me when I was in jail that my life would be like this right now, I wouldn’t have believed you though I would have desperately wanted to.

I’m thankful for every chance I get to help other people, to let individuals who are struggling know that they’re not alone, and to destroy the stigma and stereotypes surrounding addiction and recovery. I take every opportunity I get to help people understand that addiction is not a failure of morality, but a behavioral health issue.

If you are struggling, please speak up. Find a trusted, caring, non-judgmental, willing, and ready person and let them know what’s going on. Things can get better, but not until you make the choice to change and move forward. Get connected with local professional resources that can assist you in your recovery. If the situation calls for it, detox correctly and go through residential treatment. If not, consider an intensive outpatient program, or at least 12-step meetings.

Find what works for you, and do it. Surround yourself with positive and caring people who are mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually healthy. Create a support network. Fill your phone with the phone numbers of those on whom you can call when you’re struggling– even if it’s two in the morning. Practice intentional and consistent self-care that includes healthy coping skills and positive outlets. It’s not enough to just NOT use drugs and alcohol, but it’s important to figure out what to replace them with. For me, that includes things like music, writing, art, exercise, hiking, serving others, laughter, meeting new people, and experiencing new things. Find your recipe for success and then make a point to put those pieces in place every single day.

November 29th, 2021 marks 10 years of sobriety for me. I’m grateful to even be alive and amazed at the wonderful opportunities I’ve been given. Every morning when I wake up, I give thanks for the tremendous amount of grace I’ve been shown. I’m astounded at how much my life has managed to change for the better in that short amount of time. It makes me excited to see what’s next.

Thank you for taking the time to allow me to share my story with you. I hope it benefits you in some way.

2021-11-29 18:41:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r5902i/day_1755/,Day 1755,"Today is my 1755th day of not drinking.

I was a binger. I would go without drinking for weeks but then be unable to stop when I started. I also invariably lost control and did or said something stupid. Blackouts were a common occurence for me.

I stopped drinking because I hated what I had become. Alcohol changed my personality and I wasn't the nicest person to be around when I was drunk. I would become aggressive and argumentative, which is the polar opposite of what I'm like sober.

I hated the fear of not knowing what I had said or done during a blackout. I hated the hangovers. I hated being someone who my family and friends were ashamed of. I hated that I obviously had a problem with alcohol, and it was clear to anyone who ever went drinking with me.

I drank to kill the pain I felt inside of myself. I suffer from depression and anxiety, and drank because I wanted oblivion. It only made my mental health significantly worse.

I look back at some of the situations I found myself in while drunk, and think that I was very lucky that I did not die.

The last straw for me was the last time I was ""on a bender"". I was on a blackout and apparently got ejected from a pub for being rowdy and fell asleep in a bus shelter on a cold Febuary night in 2017 and missed the last bus home. I got a taxi home, and was sick in the taxi.
The next day, I found a bottle of vodka that I had obviously stashed the previous night and began swigging from it to take the edge off the rising dread.
Suddenly two thoughts came to me in quick succession - ""are you actually enjoying doing this?"" and ""is this actually achieving anything positive?"". The answer to both these questions was No.
I then walked to the bathroom and poured the vodka down the toilet, and I have not drank since.

My life did not become a magical utopia just because I stopped drinking. I am a very flawed person and have made many mistakes, but at least I have better coping strategies than the bottle now.

What I want you to know, is that I had many many failed attempts to give up drinking. If you're currently trying to stop, don't beat yourself up if you have a blip. Please persevere, because you are worth persevering for. 

I wish you all well. Thank you for reading. Bless you all xx",19

I was problematic binge drinker who progressed into an alcoholic over the course of about 10-15 years. Up until maybe 3 years ago, I never really thought stopping drinking was an option. I never knew sobriety could be so amazing. I didn't know I could have a life without alcohol since my world revolved around it. 

It wasn't until I started watching Peter Monn on YouTube that I realized life could be awesome as a sober person. And then I found this sub! I still don't know that many sober people in my city, and many here would say it's impossible since the whole city revolves around drinking. But I know you all and I know there's a better life out there for me.

And I'm so happy to finally be living it! So whether you're on day 1 or 1,001, I'm glad you're here. Some of y'all stories bring me to tears. I'm consistently touched how kind (and tough loving) this community is.

2021-11-29 17:01:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r56vts/i_cant_find_the_motivation/,I can't find the motivation,"Last time I stopped drinking for a significant amount of time I had fucked up bad. It was basically shame and fear of losing my family's respect that kept me sober. I counted down the days for a long time and I felt so proud every time I hit a new milestone. But a death in the family led me to relapse after 7.5 months sober and now I just can't seem to find the motivation to stop.

I think the problem is that moderation has been going okay for the most part. But there were about 5 nights in the last 4 months where I drank too much and really scared myself into feeling like I was gonna end up back in the dark place where I was last year. I have enough experience with this disease to know that all it would take is one night for me to fuck up completely and potentially ruin my life. So I want to stop again. But I can't seem to find it in me.

It just feels like my life is full of stress and hard to manage and it doesn't matter whether or not I'm drinking. I'm completely overwhelmed with work and being in a long distance relationship with visa issues and countless other things. So my brain is always like, what's the point of quitting if everything still sucks anyway? And then I think, well, moderation is going ok so maybe I should just do that. Or the holidays are coming up so maybe I should quit after that. Et cetera....

I'm not sure where I'm going with this I just needed to rant I guess. It feels like getting sober after a relapse is so hard because none of the milestones matter anymore. Because it just reminds me that I already got through this once and that I'd still be hitting new milestones if I hadn't fucked up.",6

I go to the bars with friends 1-2 times a week and spend between $50-100 at the bars. Sometimes it can be more but that's an average week on drinking for me.

I would also classify myself as a binge drinker as I rarely drink aside from going out with friends. I guess I'm just looking for similar stories or support from those that have quit.

My biggest fear is always missing out on a good time while friends go out but I always end up spending more money than I want to and that on top of a hangover makes me pretty depressed the next few days. 

I also live in Wisconsin where drinking seems to be a hobby for most but financially it's just not stable.",6

He also quit drinking, but our habits were very different. Mine more severe and almost relationship-breaking. 

6 days ago - I wrote on here that it was my first day sober. I got great support from you all, and I really appreciate it. 

I’ve been pledging on the “I am Sober” app every day and have been sticking to it. The app helps me keep an idea of why I’m doing this. I also really like listening to the podcast “Sober Awkward” to remind me the benefits of sober life. 

No withdrawal symptoms other than a throbbing headache, fatigue, really bad social anxiety, scatter brain, some lingering shame, and moderate depression. 

Had a mild breakdown earlier today thinking that I would never have a drink again and that it felt like a break-up. Like a weird ending to something that feels unfinished. 

Maybe because I didn’t abuse beer or wine the way I did liquor. Been going back and forth with the idea that I can still treat myself to a drink here and there, but know that if it is liquor, I’m done for. I cannot moderate with liquor, and with beer or wine, I just get sick of drinking it. I don’t even want to chase the high or the taste, I just liked drinking to dull anxieties of regular life. The oral fixation, too. My logical side is telling me it’s just not worth it; no level of buzz is. It’s just wanting that good level of it, but not really ever reaching it or surpassing it anyway. 

I’ve found myself drinking soda, juice, and other beverages more to appeal to that oral fixation, though I’m worried it’s too much sugar or not healthy either. Water doesn’t really do much and I don’t prefer sparkling waters. Was thinking of trying non-alcoholic cocktail mixes to maybe calm down the want for a “fancy” drink but feel like it’s tempting the devil in my head. 

It’s also really annoying that my coworker makes jokes about how many White Russians she will enjoy when she gets home or that she needs a margarita machine at her desk. I wish it wasn’t so socially accepted to joke about it causally. It would bring up issues with my employment should I let her know I had issues with drinking and that I’m in recovery. 

It’s only the first week of my sobriety so I’m very sure it’s normal that it all feels entirely really weird. Especially when drinking became such a pastime or something to think of so often. I’m sure I’ll feel weird for a long time, I’m just cautious to if and when something that will make me feel happy or whole will happen, if it’ll fill the void I have removing alcohol from my life. 

I’ll keep telling myself it’s worth it and the alternative is a darkness I do not wish to meet.",6

""Getting rid of it."" I haven't allowed myself to purchase any other alcohol, be it beer or hard liquor, and I've been refusing wine or eggnog and rum when offered (which was hard at first but is getting easier to say no).

It seems unreal I've made it a month sober, when before that I could barely remember a day where I didn't have at least one drink. But I got horribly black out drunk, and the hang over after it was the worst of my life. Not only did I physically feel ill, but I had lost a huge part of the evening. I woke up on my parents' couch, head at an odd angle on a tiny hard cushion, half under the dog's dirty blanket. I didn't remember getting there, and as soon as I realized where I was, the hang over hit me in time with the shame. I was horrified at having let myself go so far when the day before we'd been only celebrating my grandmother's birthday. Not exactly the kind of affair that should result in blackout drinking.

The desire for a drink is always there in the back of my mind, and while I'm proud of myself getting this far, I also wish I could do more. I'm also a heavy daily marijuana smoker (legal in Canada) and smoke from waking till bed, everyday, regardless of what I am doing or who I am with or where I am. I'd like to smoke less too, but I'm afraid that if I try, the desire for a drink might win me over. I guess that's my next hurdle.",5

Sometimes you can hit the bottom and decide not to climb out for years. It’s the anniversary of one of my worst. A cautionary tale:

Nov. 2006, Portland, Oregon. I was attending PSU and it was nearly Thanksgiving break. During those years I often stopped on my way home from school at one of the many downtown bars along the way where I’d drink and read and write, imagining myself an intellectual heir to Bukowski or some shit. One disastrous night, my stop was the Rialto, an old pool hall renowned for being a dive that overserved stiff drinks. I was on a bar stool by about 3 pm and started ordering vodka sodas. I was alone, as usual, reading the weeklies and writing poems while news from the war in Iraq played on the TVs above the bar. I was drunk quickly. But continued drinking and smoking until one of the other patrons at the bar started talking to me. Of course when two drunks meet they either beat the shit out of each other or keep drinking. Not having the heart to do the first we did the second. He gave me a cigar. I switched to whiskey.

Then it was dark outside the bar. And I remember walking unsteadily to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror with a sense of complete dissociation and I said to myself: “This is the last moment you will remember clearly tonight.” I wish that sentiment sobered me up. It didn’t. Anyway, I was right. 

The rest is a patchwork of horror. I was maybe kicked out of the bar. But I had trouble getting out the door. Then I found myself stumbling down the bus mall and feeling hostile. I remember pounding on a restaurant window and shouting through the glass. I remember perplexed and concerned faces flashing back at me. I don’t remember how I crossed the Willamette River. I might have been on a bus but I could have stumbled across the Burnside bridge too. I threw up somewhere. I do remember being kicked off a bus for yelling at people coming out of the popular Union Jacks strip club. I remember finding myself at the very busy intersection around Burnside and Stark. I was so drunk I was confused by the crossing lights and plunged into traffic, running. When I hit the other side of the intersection I took a header into a low shrub surrounded by litter-strewn mud. I went face first. I don’t know how long I lay there, just blocks up from the drunk tank. But when I pushed myself up to my feet, I’d lost my glasses and ditched my school bag that contained my ID, school books, and a graphing calculator. I was bloody and muddy. My face was scratched and bruised. But I had blocks to go before getting home if I could find it.  

The only way forward was to follow the momentum of my body and throw my feet underneath my toppling weight before I fell. I went on like that, stopping to support myself at the occasional tree before getting to my apartment. I was vaguely aware I was near home. My girlfriend was outside smoking and talking on the phone. I didn’t recognize her. I was crying and asking for her to help me find my house. She took me inside. I passed out on the bed and woke up in a pool of my own piss hours later, a bit more lucid. It was only 8 pm.

I was lucky I did not die that night.

Even after all of that, I did not stop drinking. I would continue to hit bottom again and again over the next 14 years. And yet, I continued to “function” and tell myself I didn’t really have a problem. 

The bottom that sobered me up, finally, was not so dramatic. It was the realization that I felt I had to hide my drinking from my wife. It was the day-in and day-out exhaustion of drunken calculus about how much I could drink and when and where and if I had enough booze in the house. 

To me, the lesson is that you don’t have to wait to stop drinking. Because rock bottom may not come. And if it comes it may not look like you think it should. If you feel you should stop, then you’re probably right. And even if you’ve hit that bottom and bounced and are questioning, you can always start stopping.  

tl:dr — Even after very nearly killing myself one night because I was drunk, I didn’t get sober until over a decade later. It’s never too late. IWNDWYT",102

So, the plan is to take a double dose of vistaril (sleeping meds) (cleared taking a little extra with the doc, no harm) about an hour before I clock out. Keys are in a different room so I'd have to go get them, rather than just grab them off the desk I'm working at. Wallet is in another room so id have to go grab it as well. 

Also just realized my car is basically out of gas so I'd have to fill the tank up too if I go out. 

All drinks poured out on my lunch break. I got nothing but green tea and a sugar free red bull. Got a YouTube playlist I'm working on that I'm gonna just hit go on and let it play. 

When I get off work I'm laying my ass down, watching this playlist, and playing some gosh darn Stardew valley. It's gonna be nice.

It's affecting everything too. work, social life, finances. a friend recently told me ""you just have no reason to quit man, thats your issue."" and Im not sure hes wrong. i mean, besides the affects its having on my body, but, i really dont care for myself that much to begin with, so its not helpful. 

im going to, again, try today. the goal is to go straight to bed after work. just immediately hit the pillow. it hasnt worked before, but its the only thing i can think to do other than grab the keys and head to the store. 

i also moved the keys somewhere else. theyre not on my desk, so theres going to be a bit of thinking i get to do while i go grab them. 

i dunno, its just pain all the time. being sick, being tired, being more depressed than i think ive ever been in my life.. i mean ive never had such dark thoughts so often. you would think at this point i would stop the one thing i know is making all the problems even worse. its so dumb. i take it all back, every time i said i had it under control, ever time i said i was just experimenting, every time i said ""its fine."" its not, it never was. the warning signs were all there.

this is one of those days i could really do with friend to just lay my head on for a while, a hug, or some form of affection.  ive pushed everyone away though and understandably, no one in my circle, or what was my circle, wants anything to do with me. im a ticking time bomb of emotion or drunkness and they know that. ive been essentially kicked out of every friend group i had, again, every circle i belonged to. and i dont blame them. 

so.. no friends, no family, too much money, no self worth, no hobbies i enjoy anymore. man im a mess arent i? getting fatter and sadder by the day. when is ""rock bottom"" everone talks about? just seems like i keep asking for more punishment. more bad days

anyways thats enough of me pouting for now. whether im too hung over to care or not, the sun will come up tomorrow. this is really petty, but im convinced ive created a situation where no one really cares about me, including myself. so it really doesnt matter. if i pull myself together and get back to being normal, no one will care. if i dont, and end up a homeless drunk, no one will care. i did this to myself so i have no one to blame, it just hurts. its really hard",6

Sometimes I just wonder what even was the point? Obviously I get to live, less chance of disease or horrible car crash. But meh…

Anyway I am still proud for having done it and having kept it up so long, even through thanksgiving. 

And now my wife, who quit the same day as me… in fact that first sober day was spent figuring out how to get her into inpatient rehab. And the hard detox month was, for me, also spent without her and with minimal contact due to her program. In many ways I was more proud of her than myself.

Anyway she went to deal with some stuff at her family’s house, hard time being reminded of a not-great childhood and other badness. But she came home drunk. She’d asked me the previous day, what would i think if she just got some vodka? I basically said I didn’t think it was a great idea nor would it really help or have any positive effect.

We left it at that, and she didn’t do anything, and then the next day did it anyway. And now, today, she had the day off for a day trip we didn’t end up taking, so she left the house to take a walk (something she’s been working on doing since she quit) and I’m pretty sure she’s been drinking again.

So the score is me:180, her:-2. And it feels like shit and I don’t know why i keep it up exactly. And I get a zoom meeting with HR for other semi-related-but-not-really reasons and i have no idea what will happen.

I've always been highly conscious of my health and what is put into my body. That took a backseat in college, and I began drinking like an absolute madman with a death wish. I had a twisted sense of pride in being able to do shot after shot of mid/low tier tequila without the usual lime and salt combo. In senior year of college I lived at a frat house where there was a keg of cheap beer on ice in the dining room at all hours. Plenty of blackout nights, and days wasted recovering from abhorrent hangovers. 

Despite this, I continued to focus on eating healthy and maintained an alright physique by running occasionally (a far cry from my high school cross country days). People knew me as someone who always focused on my physical health. Despite that, it never clicked until a few weeks ago that I have been actively poisoning myself with alcohol for years. Only recently did I start running for real again by completing a half marathon. I decided to do a small experiment beforehand, and stop drinking a week prior to the race. By the time race day came around, I could feel a huge difference in my performance compared to prior training. I began to imagine the potential benefits without alcohol for a month, or even a whole year. 

So despite only being 25 and potentially giving up a large aspect of being ""young and free,"" I've decided to stop drinking for the foreseeable future. If anyone is trying to live a healthy life, it seems like one of the most impactful things to do is cut alcohol. Everything from sleep quality, physical performance and mental clarity to organ health and cancer risk are negatively impacted by something that only gives you a temporary high. One of the quotes I've seen that had the most impact on me was ""why give up everything for one thing, when you can give up one thing for everything?""",11

My question is- how do you really convince yourself that alcohol does nothing for you? That the cons farrrrr outweigh the benefits? I’m finding this a bit difficult without having had a rock bottom. There are lots of shitty consequences to my drinking but a part of me is trying to justify doing it a bit longer - “I’ll just drink like this until I’m 25 then cut it out” kinda thing. 

I’ve read Alcohol Explained and This Naked Mind and am pretty on board with all those ideas but there’s still a little voice in my head still feeling deprived and that believes that alcohol can still do things for me. I don’t fully trust myself long term, despite knowing that it’s better for me to not drink. 

Is it just time? Just learning to do things without alcohol, teaching your subconscious that you can do this and that and still have a good time? Will the desire eventually be dead and I’ll have a watershed moment where I’m fully convinced alcohol is a poison and its benefits are a total illusion?! 

Any ideas, books, writing exercises, etc would be appreciated. I want to brainwash myself, basically.

I’ve had random stints in rehab and a few runs at home but I couldn’t get anything really under my belt. I was just going through the motions, never doing the real work.

Fast forward to now, I just left my fourth inpatient rehab center because I drank and they sent me to the ER/detox.  I’m here because I was too embarrassed to call and say hey I want to drink - instead I proceeded my way and am sitting in a hospital bed. All alone, far away from family. This is the darkest I’ve ever felt, I see others that are sober and seem to live a great life? How do I get there? How much shit do I have to deal with (that I created) before I can get there? Help me see this is worth it. My family is done hearing the same story and same apologizes over and over. Help..",10

Day 15:

Finally feeling like I’m actually sleeping; have started to dream again, which I completely had not realized that I had lost the ability! 

I finally have an appetite again and am digesting food; still in need of gaining weight but starting to feel the benefits of absorbing my nutrition! Enjoying food much more. 

It’s hard to realize just how shitty you feel when it’s chronic, but when you eliminate alcohol it’s quite apparent how bad you felt!

I can't be with a woman who is sober.  He went to the waitress and got me a glass of wine and said.,.. drink.    That was life with him...

We have all kinds of issues so I finally got the strength to leave him yesterday.  I knew I couldn't improve my life with him in that way....and so what did I do?  I drank.  I am SO hungover today and I am doing everything I can not to drink to take the pain away.

I am missing him...and wondering if I made the right decision...but I know in my gut ...life wouldn't end well if we spent our lives together.  (he wanted to get engaged) 

I am at a loss.  Today I am more than ever...realizing....wow.  I'm an alcoholic.  I have to be SOBER.  I can't moderate .... because moderate to me is...1 bottle instead of 2 bottles of wine...

I quit drinking some time ago now. 62 days based on my flair. I have always smoked weed and never had any issue with it. Well that changed a few nights ago. My wife came home with edibles and I had one. It wasn't to bad for awhile but when it kicked in I found myself having trouble standing, thinking straight, or doing much of anything. I ended the night vomiting all over the bathroom, showering, and passing out in my bed. This was the night we planned to put up all our decorations for Christmas with our kids. 

I really feel like I failed my entire family doing this but as I sat in the bathroom vomiting my guts up I realized something. Weed had just replaced alcohol for me. I had this exact same situation happen more then once with alcohol. Weed was no longer something I just casually did because why not. It was now my main drug of choice. This all happened on 11-26 and since then I haven't touched the stuff and don't ever want to again.

I know this sub is about stop drinking but here is my PSA. Please be careful when you are trying to stop drinking. Alcohol is such a good drug and you need to find something to replace it carefully. I don't mean with another drug but with SOMETHING. ANYTHING that makes you feel good about yourself. Otherwise you may end up addicted to something else just as much without realizing it.

I also feel much younger than most people trying to quit. But maybe I'm just naive, and haven't found the right people to talk to or books to read or groups to join that will make me realize my story is not as unique as I fear it is.

And so I'm hoping if I share this here, someone might be able to point me to the right place or remind me that I'm not the only person in the world struggling in this particular shade of alcohol misuse, or the only person my age trying to quit this thing that's woven into the social fabric of my life as a 20-something in NYC.

I'm capable of going without a drink for weeks at a time, and in the past I could go months sober without even realizing it. But every time I do choose to drink, it's like I'm playing russian roulette with a blackout.

In the past year, I've realized it's a problem. My friends have realized it's a problem, too. And I've toyed with the idea of quitting, or quitting ""just for a while"", and I've gotten AF beverages and made mocktails for a few months at a time until I thought ""I *can* control myself!"" and then I start to ease back in, ""I'll drink occassionally, a couple at a happy hour or wine with dinner"" and I do, I have just one or two glasses maybe once a week and I'm successful at it. I think ""See? You were overreacting, you don't need to get sober"" So that turns into a few nights a week, and a few drinks each time, until I've grown so comfortable and confident with my moderate drinking that I stop really paying attention and start bingeing at parties and bars again. And then I black out and do something humiliating/innapropriate/danerous/shameful/hurtful to those around me. And then I start all over again.",12

\- Friends worth keeping were the ones who were supportive, those who weren't I soberly discovered weren't really worth my time.

\- It's a lot easier to say yes to frou-frou coffee drinks when you know how many fewer calories you're consuming than when drinking alcohol. 

\- I'm a MUCH better mom, wife, daughter, sister, friend when I'm sober. 

\- Having a community like stopdrinking is SO IMPORTANT, I was able to remain sober this past year because I was able to read everyone's stories, receive support, and learn more about this addiction that I share with others. 

\- Even after a year I can't even think about one glass of wine without thinking of finishing up the bottle. 

I decided I would give myself a year to prove to myself that I could make it a year without having alcohol and then ""treat myself"" on my next birthday.

I havent updated my date, but last week I got a bottle of vodka.  I had about 2 shots and felt too guilty to have any more.  When my BIL came home, I poured the entire 175 down the sink in front of him, appologized and then when my sister arrived, told her and appologized too.  BIL was atleast a bit thankful but my sister just kept saying how I threw 4 months away and I'm starting all over, etc.  Thatss not how I'd like to think of it but whatever.

Bottom line, nothing horrendous aside from me losing sleep happened.  In fact, I was extra productive, trying to keep my mind off of the bottle until my BIL got home.  I did a load of chores, dyed my hair/extensions, laundry, dishes, cat box, etc.

It was Thanksgiving weekend and I knew they'd be home so I've just been waiting for today to have some alone time to relax-I just started a new job and after not working a year, 30-some hours a week is exhausting.  Its retail too, so I spend all day with people only to come home and be around them.  On top of that, I got my first vaccine shot on Friday, so I'm just not feeling super great anyhow.  I spent a lot of this weekend that I wasnt working in my own room to get a little peace and deal with the side effects(tiredness, headache, etc).

All of Saturday while I was at work I was pestered for my schedule by them and I was pretty damn sure I knew why.  I finally got home after having to basically beg for a ride because it was pouring rain and it's a mile walk back and I'm immediately pestered for my schedule.  I finally relented and sure as shit, only my days off are written in.  I wake up this morning, ready to have a peaceful day to myself...my sister is working from home.  I'm literally fuming just writing this.

On top of that, I woke up yestersay(Sunday) still feeling shit from the vaccine and my BIL immediately tells me I look like I've been drinking all night.  Thanks.  No.  Then a short while later tells my sister that I have big feet (literally wtf?  Why and where did this come from?  For reference I'm a US 7.5 FFS.  That's factually smaller than average 🤦‍♀️) and this is one of my few insecurities.  My feet, my ears and my eating habits are things I've always struggled with and been teased for.  With all the other shit, this really got to me.  So I holed up in my room all day.

They are treating me like a fucking teenager.  I am not easily upset, I can brush things off most of the time, but I so NOT want to be smothered.  It only makes me want to drink 10 fold to escape this shit.  I am 27 fricken years old.  I get that I've lost trust and I'm living under their roof at the moment, but I know I will end up in a total break down if this continues.  I have 4 straight days of early shifts this week and I NEED to wind down ALONE.  What made spending time with them before enjoyable was that I had plenty of alone time.  It feels like I have absolutely nothing now.

I dont know what to say without blowing up/breaking down.  I'm very tempted to just rent a room down the street and take the time for myself.  I'd rather throw away $100 on a room and some food so I can unwind before this work stretch than sit here wound up and stressed the next 2 days.  I just know this will result in them freaking out even worse.  I'm afraid they'd lock me out of the house or something.

Especially with the female characters- girlfriends bonding over wine, getting tipsy on the wink-wink “Irish” eggnog, chugging champagne after some silly event planning mishap🙄 

I miss the simple days when our snowy small town heroine drank hot chocolate with a peppermint stick!",6

Typically drink 4-5 nights a week, most of them being 2-3 beers with the weekends being much heavier.

Never drink during the day, never drink and drive, never have had my work impacted, but I’ve found I sometimes get terrible anxiety after drinking socially, especially at the bars like I was somehow rude or embarrassing even if I don’t remember being so.

I also drink to reduce anxiety, mainly on Sundays when the “Sunday Scaries” set in and my anxiety skyrockets.

Basically, I don’t want to be the person who drinks up to 8 beers at a child’s birthday party, but I also want to be able to accept a craft beer or the like when visiting a friend for instance.

Does this middle ground exist or is it an impossible goal to aim for considering my prior problems?

I know many people will say to cut it out entirely but in my “perfect” scenario I can drink once or twice a month and be content with 2-3 beers.

EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for their discourse, advice, and kind words. At a minimum I’m taking December off and we’ll go from there. Probably one of the worst months with Christmas and New Year’s but I think the “challenge” may be better in determining if I can handle it. I can count the days I haven’t drank at least one drink in the last 5 years on my fingers and toes so it’s time to make a change. Thanks again to all!",80

After an eight day sober streak I caved to temptation last night and had 6-7 drinks. We had family over and my father-in-law is a big beer drinker so my wife went out and got some beer and cider. Even though she knows I want to quit, she doesn’t care if I drink because she doesn’t think I have a major problem. So I had beers. 

But in the hour leading up to having the first one, I had such an internal battle going. Part of me told me I would hate myself today if I drank yesterday, which of course turned out to be true, but another part of me said I had gone eight days, so it’s not a big deal. It was honestly an agonizing hour because I felt like it was inevitable that I would given.

So today I am sad and disappointed in myself. Nothing bad or embarrassing happened, but I really want to get alcohol out of my life for good. I just know I am better without it. What tools do you use when you are tempted like I was? I’ve heard play the tape forward, but that didn’t work for me yesterday. What else do you do? And how do I not get complacent after a week or more and think it’s OK to have a day where I drink? This always happens to me. I make it a week or three and then give in because my bad memories fade and I convince myself it’s ok. 

I really do value this community. I spend time each day reading it and trying to pick up wisdom from each of you. Thanks in advance for sharing part of you.",4

Last time I quit drinking, I focused a lot on the ""I can't drink."" ""I screwed things up and now I can't do the thing I enjoy anymore."" It caused a lot of resentment in early sobriety that never really went away. As time went on, I started seeing it as a choice I made...the problem there was focusing on the choice opened the door (for me) to considering moderation again. I chose to stop once, surely I could choose to stop again, right?! (Narrator: She did not ""choose"" to stop again for 5 years or so, and it got BAD during those 5 years.)

I'm trying to build a firmer base this time and one thing that's helping me is to focus on \*both\* thoughts this time, but in different ways. I can't drink...in moderation. No one is stopping me from going out the store to buy booze, I'm not grounded, I'm not a child. I can't drink in moderation because I'm someone who always wants more. And \*because\* I can't drink in moderation, I am choosing not to try it again. I don't enjoy the way I actually drink regardless of my good intentions, so I choose a different life.

I do not want to drink the way I actually drink.

So far, at least, this is helping me with both the resentment and the moderation thoughts.",24

This last summer, I reached 2 years of sobriety.  I still feel good about that and can’t deny that I’ve come a long way.

My family and I recently moved and I had to return to our old house and pack things up.  All told, I had 4 weeks alone in our old house that was no longer our home.  And all told, I drank 5 times during that time.

I found the move so stressful that I reached for the bottle again.  It’s just such a slippery slope and it really does get easier to believe that it will be ok.  It’s harder and harder to ignore that seductive voice that says drinking is the right thing to do, it will take you away from the stress.

I’ve had to reset my sobriety date and now have just over 3 weeks.  I have to be honest with my slip up and look at it as part of the path forward.

Can I just, *get this out?* 

I'm an alcoholic. I'm shit at AA. I've got my therapist and psych, with my rx for naltrexone. I have friends who cheer me on, and would support me if I'd let them. 

I'm 31 and my mother is one of my biggest triggers. I see her once a week and lately she has been on a *kick*. My coworker/friend died on Saturday. This week I'm getting the news on whether I get a big promotion or not. The promotion (or lack of), that moment in the conference room is the point where I'm worried I'll relapse. I've been working tirelessly since May for this and this other coworker jumped 'into the race' this round. She has more leadership experience, she's poised, and fuck me if they choose her. It'll break me.

I know it doesn't have to, I know this. I know I can get through this. I have to. It won't be one day of misery drinking. It will be a stepping point for a binge episode lasting weeks or more. I won't be able to share my wins, the counter will reset. I know I'll feel like *garbage* physically and mentally. But if they choose her over me? Fuck guys. When will I be enough?

I was drinking my way through a homework assignment a week and a half ago in the middle of a very tough week, when it connected with me; drinking doesn’t make any of the hardships better. It just delays feeling shitty to the following morning. That rush from drinking something smooth and refreshing with alcohol in it only last about 20 minutes too. After that it’s all down hill, at least for me. 

My last really intense night of drinking was when I went over to some friends’ house to watch the AEW pay per view. It was a great time but I drank way more than everyone else. I had 7 beers, and for no reason other than that I started. I would chug one, want another, then another, then another. By the end of it, I was slurring my words, annoying the fuck out of my fiance, and walking heavily. Stomping. I couldn’t help it. Did the drinking make that first 10 minutes a little more exciting? Sure. But then I was internally more focused on the next drink than any of the excellent wrestling and I was out the $20 I spent on the 12 pack that I had most of… I just hate that.

Last weekend was the first real test. Walking by bodegas and wanting a pick me up after work is one thing but I had friends over for Dungeons and Dragons and didn’t partake in any drinking. It was a seltzer night for all of us, and ya know what? It was great. The urge to drink because of learned social anxiety was there, but it faded. I may have been a little more reserved than if I had been drinking. When I have a few, not a lot, I am looser and funnier socially. But that’s in me. It’s not dependant on drinking. I’ve just used drinking to bring it out easier, but it’s me. I can work on being more relaxed at parties without substances. These past 10 days have proven that to me.

Also, I lost about 2 pounds already. I haven’t changed a thing other than cutting out alcohol. Pretty neat.

Some lovely family time. My parents enjoy a drink, my father sometimes a bit too much, but hey so do I. Anyways, the reason I'm sharing this is sobriety and recovery is so strange. Sometimes it feels like a struggle other times its so easy. I managed to not even bat an eyelid at them drinking round about me, it was all civil relaxed and responsibile (definitely not a phrase I'd be using if I was drinking however).

I've relapsed may times, I've justified one drink many times. I've been suicidal, and most kinds of 'al' you can think of. But please if you're struggling, if you think you're a failure, please believe me when I say you're really not. I've spent days, weeks and months, sometimes years thinking I'm a failure. But I honestly wouldn't swap my best day drinking for my worst day sober. It is very early days for me, but it's getting better all the time. When I say better I don't mean easy, or necessarily happy. I just mean not drunk, not blind drunk full of fear and destructiveness. 

For anyone interested, I've been in a 12 step fellowship before. Managed 2 years of sobriety before relapsing. I'm not using that route at present, although aspects of the programme are engrained in my mind from my time there. My moment of clarity was waking up surrounded by paramedics just over 2 months ago, in the gutter with no money or shame. I'd stooped that low I didn't even care anymore.

Be patient, find your way, and do what you need to do. My self esteem is naturally low, so I'm practising doing esteemable things. Brush my teeth, take my tablets, have a shower, do the washing, take care of my son, make sure he gets my undivided attention for a few hours per day (very fortunate I can do this), show up for work, pay my bills, try and be kind to my family (I'm naturally a bit of a d***head but I've made peace with it and try hold myself accountable for whenever I'm being like this).

Thank you to everyone on this sub today, and to everyone else out there struggling. You are the reason I'm currently chilling whilst 'working' from a safe and happy home. My little boy is napping, we are happy. I am happy. I will not drink with you today.",6

Please.,"My roommate made me dinner and got wine. I am just not ready to talk about why I'm not drinking, and when confronted with alcohol I sort of panicked. I said to myself, ""I'll have one glass so I don't need to talk about it"" but once it hit my bloodstream I really changed and just kept drinking. You know how it goes.

It's not his fault, it's mine. I avoided my own discomfort and shame around my issues by just trying to get sober in secret, and then by deciding that I can pretend to be a normal drinker to avoid shame around others. So I really need to learn to tackle my own shame, as much as I can.

Here's what I think I want to say, please tell me what you think and also what I should expect:

>I'm going to be honest, I don't want to think about or talk about this, but I think I have a drinking problem. I can't moderate myself around alcohol, so even if I don't drink every day, it's still a problem that I can't stop once I start. I've been researching this and I think the best thing for me is total sobriety. I don't mind if you drink at home, but I can't handle being offered alcohol right now, and for the time being I think I need to stay away from bars and the like. You didn't do anything wrong--you had no idea because I MADE SURE you had no idea--but I guess if I wanna get better I have to tell you.

>Thank you for being a good friend and wanting to share things you like--and that I like, A LOT--with me.

Ruined a 27 day streak today.,"I have been a  lurker in this sub, and a drinker for too long. I always take breaks and feel great but drink again and ramp up to drinking after work for days in a row. I don’t get wasted, I don’t get angry. I waste my time, I melt to the couch or phone or floor. I waste my money, which is my time at work. I waste my health. I started drinking young, and ferociously at that. Being a brooding teen in the punk scene moving into a restaurant culture. It hasn’t destroyed my relationships with anyone but myself, and it hasn’t been a tidal wave but a constant current.

I worry about becoming boring, losing an edge I suppose, but In hindsight being an alcoholic will probably keep me where I am for years to come — and that’s fucking boring.  It’s a social glue, and social coping mechanism I’m having to train myself out of. 

Today I had two beers after 27 days of refraining. I got a little buzzed and it wasn’t the song my brain remembered hearing. I am proud of myself for not continuing today, god I wanted two or four more. The corner store or 2 bars within blocks of my house never seemed closer.

The cravings are getting worse but was able to fight them off, however the temptation is getting stronger given that I was drinking 4-5 nights a week on average prior to joining.

There's a chance I won't make it through this week without a drink, telling myself if I need to give in to wait for the weekend. Prior to joining here my initial goal was to cut drinking back to one night a week on weekends only, but failed on every attempt as well as breaking my own rule ""Do not drink consecutive nights!"".

I should be proud that I've lasted 5 whole days without drinking, downloaded the I Am Sober app to track daily progress and changes in physical and mental health. If I can make it through this week sober that would be amazing, but honestly my sanity is slipping and a quiet night playing video games and drinking sounds blissful and relaxing. Not sure if my mind is looking for a way to justify another night of drinking, or if drinking less often is a better approach than going cold turkey for me.

Still on the fence on what to do at the moment, feel like my sanity should be prioritised but could also be a trap the inner-addict has set up for myself..

Meaning that you're not going to hear a lot from us.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning everyone. I’m glad you are here making a commitment to another day without drinking. Before I decided to make this commitment myself back in August, I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to do it, especially if faced with a situation where I would be presented again and again with the opportunity to drink.

&#x200B;

It turns out that decision fatigue is a very real thing. Throughout the day as you make decisions, your brain gets tired of making decisions and the ability to make good ones declines. It’s like doing another rep at the gym when your muscles are tired. Some big-time decision-makers arrange their days to eliminate as many small decisions as possible to increase the quality of the big decisions they know they will be making. For example, if all a person's clothes are the same color, the decision as to what to wear that day becomes a non-event and decision-making mojo gets saved for other more important decisions. 

&#x200B;

In my case, to be successful at not drinking, I needed to ask for help in the following way. I asked my husband to help me by stopping his evening habit of offering to pour or make me a drink. He readily agreed to help, and began offering a mocktail. With alcohol-free drinks, the compulsion for more was eliminated. Asking for help tipped me into the region of success.

&#x200B;

An unexpected benefit occurred. My husband drastically reduced his alcohol intake too. So many good things happened for us both, including better sleep, no hangovers, reduction in inflammation, and more. I make sure to keep the focus on me, and don’t mind his occasional glass of wine. \[Which he sometimes leaves half-finished and this proves beyond any doubt in my mind that he is a remarkable person.\]

&#x200B;

Reading the DCI and making a daily commitment to not drink reminds me of what I am doing and how important it is. I want to keep the changes that have occurred and have them continue to unfold. Like the DCI intro above says,

“ . . . only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!”

Amen to that. IWNDWYT",354

I’m at day 17 today and I feel so proud. I made it thru thanksgiving,5

I woke up sick, with wine leftover. I still have wine throw up splatters on the wall next to my bed from the last time I picked up my husbands gun 3-4 weeks ago.

I took a Leave Of Absence from work Friday. I’m a covid nurse and before the trolls come, I am always Sober the night before and the day I work. 

But I got up Weds & Continued to drink, began throwing up and then I find myself holding a gun, shucked a bullet in the chamber 4-5 times not understanding why it wasn’t working 11/24/21. I forgot about the 5lb weight on the trigger; I was sobbing so hard. My husband took my kids to the store prior to this.

I don’t have insurance and am trying to find a therapist outside of my local CSB. i come from a family of alcoholics & mental illness (3 Alive in recovery). I’ve been to 2 AA meetings This week. I do not like it. and have gone to rehab, not good experiences.. Sober from benzos 4 yrs. Thank you for letting me share.",13

Logged in today and cried at seeing a post from /stopdrinking pop up because... wow.  it was a great reminder of how shit used to be, how helpless I felt to stop drinking or find any stability -- for years my life was a roller coaster of self-loathing, public humiliation, spotty employment, and ruined relationships.  for years, I tried to get sober, and for years no amount of guilt and white-knuckling ever worked.  Today, I have been sober for about 14 months and have zero desire whatsoever to drink.  it gets better!  I even worked as a sober bartender for several at a time while sober with only two or three very manageable alcohol cravings in in about 50 shifts months (money is money, years of experience, and after 7 months sober I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it --  I categorically DO NOT recommend anyone else do this because it's incredibly high-risk, but I am sharing for context specifically because I remember being deeply frightened that I would have alcohol cravings every day for the rest of my life). I left the job because of the stress and the hours, not the booze... it felt SO GOOD to be able to make that choice.

&#x200B;

IT! IS! POSSIBLE!

YOU CAN DO IT!

&#x200B;

Even if you have tried and it hasn't worked, keep going.  you're worth it.  you can do it.  every time we try and relapse, it  gives us more wisdom on precisely what it is that brings us to drink in the first place.  The life I have now is a million miles of difference, and every moment was worth it.  The freedom of never being hung over is intoxicating -- almost as intoxicating as reveling in the newfound ability to CHOOSE my actions instead of reacting 24/7.  My anxiety disorder has almost entirely gone away; the things I told myself about drinking to help my anxiety were only half-true, as the alcohol's effects on my brain were causing more shit than they fixed.  I have meaningful and resilient self-esteem now, I don't take bullshit from people, and I honor MY OWN needs instead of acting like a doormat and then drinking about it later.  As it turns out, it's a hell of a lot easier to take meaningful accountability for our own actions when we refuse to continue blaming ourselves for the misdeeds of others!   Now, instead of breaking my own heart over and over again with booze, I get to sit in Drugs psychology courses while I earn my credentials as a neuropsychologist.  Everything changes for the better when you can get out of the hole!

this may or may not be a bit controversial (it really shouldn't be, please do not get mad at me I am sincerely trying to help and it's a bummer that people get reactively mad at this because effective and well-researched treatment protocols should be respected regardless of whether they agree with preconceived understandings of current protocols) BUT

if you have a trauma disorder / unresolved psychological trauma and you keep trying AA and it keeps not working, do something else!  After 5 *years* of going to AA meetings back and forth, working the program and then leaving when I would have some emotional crisis to binge drink about etc etc, my therapist of 3 years finally just ordered me to stop going.  people who love the program have told me to my face that I am lying about that having happened, and I do not take it personally, but I am being dead serious.  I stopped going; it worked.  As it turns out, my problem was not a lack of shame or guilt about my drinking or accountability -- my problem WAS that shame.  this is true for some of us, and not true for others, so your mileage may vary widely.

HOWEVER

if you have PTSD or you feel an endless gnawing guilt about being a messy horrible irredeemable person who doesn't deserve happiness because you're Bad, and the 12 steps keep failing even though you're fully willing to do all inventories and have a sincere desire to make amends... it's worth looking into alternative methods.  All we want is sobriety, and there's no shame in needing to pursue a different pathway if it's morally sound and it gets you where you're going.  *The research backs it up -- you are not a bad person for needing help to get sober another way.  If I could go back in time and tell this to myself, I would in a heartbeat, but I can't, so I am making a reddit post in the hopes that maybe it helps someone else who is in those shoes.* If you already have a running inventory of every bad thing you've ever done and every person you want to apologize to lest the shame consume you, and if you feel guilty for taking up space, this may be helpful to you.  Find any way you can to get in touch with a trauma-informed substance counselor, many states provide free programs.  Even if you have to pay for therapy, I'm willing to guarantee that it's cheaper than being an alcoholic.

(on the money note: getting sober will help you not be broke.  I was broke all the time!  Now, I have a savings account AND I buy myself nice things! There has been no change in income!  I actually make less money now!  some more motivation, if it helps.  Now, when I need or want to buy something, I jokingly refer to the amount of money spent in units of NATs, or ""normal alcoholic thursdays.""  oof!)

Also worth looking into the Sinclair Method, I do not have personal experience with it but as a treatment protocol it has been hugely helpful for many people.  The research is consistently promising and it's widely used in Europe; if I ever slip back into drinking that will be my number 1 immediate move to pursue addiction extinction.  Essentially, naltrexone is used to rewire our brains to no longer push out a euphoria response to alcohol, thereby extinguishing the compulsion toward alcohol.  it's honestly really cool if you're into that reading kind of stuff :) I love neuroscience

often, we are told that we have to get sober before we can start processing our trauma; for me and many others, the opposite is true.  I was only able to get sober after I processed my trauma in two clinical trials for PTSD therapies.  We drink to self-medicate, and if we're gonna stay sober long term we have to figure out how to fix what we're self-medicating for in other ways.

&#x200B;

much love to all of you.  next time it feels hopeless, please remember that time is real wobbly...  your sober self is sitting right there in the future.  they love you, all of you, and they are cheering you on.

In the current time, I am proud of all of you for continuing to fight for a better life.  every single one of you deserves it.",12

Then right after that I moved into my first apartment at age 20 and soon became 21 and my drinking habits instantly got worse, without me even realizing how bad it was. My ex during the time didn’t say a word, he was also my roommate. No one heard my cries, everyone on Snapchat laughed at me and enabled my alcohols abuse. All I wanted was someone to be there, someone to numb the pain. 
Each day the drinking finally made me feel, feel emotions that I never learned how to express because in the black community, it’s looked down upon if a man cries or shows emotions and you’re a “f**” if you wear your emotions in your sleeve. 
During my binge drinking I begin to learn how powerful and good it felt to finally be able to express and feel my emotions and to never live life numb.
Causing me to fall deeper into depravity into the darkness alcoholism brings. Leading me into self destruction. 
Drinking and driving and driving, taking four to seven shots a day prior to me clocking in at work; the job I worked so hard to build my identity up for to soon realize that it was all taken away, if i couldn’t meet up to their expectations. 
Oh the friends I met afterward after being committed to drinking everyday, I soon to realize that I hate this drinking, I need to stop because now I can’t feel because of all of this drinking. 
Finally believing I found family to quickly realize that family don’t encourage self destruction. To realize they were only partying friends. 
Oh would the drinking stop, then moving home my older sister and dad constantly bringing me the drinks after I begged them to stop. They didn’t hear but bought me drinks and I couldn’t resist. Oh would the drinking stop? 
Then it finally clicked that I have to do better I have to be better and I will not be their laughing stock. 
They bring me drinks and I said no. 
They bring wine and I politely declined. 
The cans of liquor begin to decrease month after month to lead me to have stop drinking for eight months out of the entire year so far. 
Oh the pain is slowly dissipating and the pain is going away. Oh I can feel emotions again and not depend on the drink to feel again. This is life, this is the beauty I have been trying to define for so many years. A life without the bottle. 
If I can do it anyone can…. I went from drinking a fifth a day and two beers to being sober for eight months. I believe in you all who needs some encouragement.",21

Day three for me. I’ve seen day three many, many, times over the last few years and rarely see day 4. Last streak I had was 9 days. Thanksgiving and the desire (likely misguided and unhelpful) not to disclose my issues to my family made me cave. My mom sent me home with a bottle of wine and…y’all know…I *had* to finish it. Then I’d “be done”.  Again. 

After a few months of lurking here, and a couple recent recovery days, I felt good and I DID THE THINGS. I did all the laundry, washed all the dishes, reorganized my daughters room. I wanted to reward myself with fresh sheets to start the work week off. 

Honestly, I couldn’t tell you the last time a changed them. 

As I was putting fresh sheets on, I noticed a large bubble under the old bottom sheet right under my side of the bed. It was one of those dryer balls. They’re not small. 

…I have been passing out on a bumpy pile of dirty sheets for who knows long. And I was too out of it to notice. 

I could go on and on about the hangovers, the guilt of feeling like I’m not present for my child, the embarrassing drunk texts, the wasted money, the looks of liquor store clerks. But damn, I’ve been passing out on top of a near literal softball for weeks (months?) and I didn’t notice. Wtf.

At the beginning of the pandemic, I’d say January 2020, I started heavily consuming alcohol. It got to a point where I was drinking about a 1.75L a day. It really wasn’t until I was experiencing terrible withdrawals that I realized I had a problem. I had tremors, very shaky, could barely eat. I remember having to basically force food down. I was pacing around extremely anxious, I couldn’t sleep. Sometimes I would feel like a sudden jolt in my heart that would make me get out of bed and pace around in the dark having panic attacks. It was awful, I really did think I was going to die at times and I still don’t know how I’m still here. 

Anyways late 2020 I ended up deploying and went sober for those 10 months, and found a new love for fitness and self-care. I returned home from deployment and thought I was cured of my alcoholism and that I could have a few because I thought I could handle it. Old feelings started coming back and I felt it was going to take control of me again, so I stopped and I really want to stay sober for the rest of my life.

My 3 months sober was a few days ago, I checked the I Am Sober app, and I am very proud but also I do have cravings here and there and have to talk myself out of it.

I agree, but the issue I have is that when I'm sober I'm very adept at automatically suppressing my emotions and find myself unable to feel anything but numbness (much less cry) regarding stuff I know I should feel strong feelings about. When I feel the urge to drink alone, it's not really out of a desire to avoid my feelings; it's actually an attempt to get feelings out and be able to feel them. 

&#x200B;

I grew up with a lot of ""boys/men don't cry"" type rhetoric that definitely affected me for a long time and led to my valuing external emotional self control way too much, but I feel like I've moved past that now and I don't consciously agree with those ideas anymore. Maybe my subconscious hasn't caught up? Idk. I've tried many times to let myself cry and access my emotions without substances, but it just doesn't happen - it's hard to force it when I genuinely don't feel it w/o substances. On the other hand, when I'm drinking I can cry easily, and it does feel cathartic and healthy.

I know I cant undo what I did at all but its hard always having my past used as a weapon to beat me with when I am trying to be better.

How do I get past this?

And if it’s not namby pamby beer, it’s expensive outdoor sports (skiing, cycling, mountain biking, hunting, fly fishing, etc.) how the hell do I make friends!?!?!?

-A glass of wine in the bathtub (so fancy, so relaxing)

-Two fingers of whiskey (or mulled wine) by the fireplace (so cozy)

-A glass of champagne during a celebration (harmless, right? we need to toast and celebrate!)

-A fancy grocery store with fancy soaps and vegan options (why not buy wine? It is something healthy people buy???)



-A cold beer on a hot summer day (watch the sunset on your porch with a beer!)

-A shot of *insert hard liquor here* after a traumatic event (it numbs the pain)

-A cocktail to carry around at a party (for social lubrication) 

Etc. Ad nauseum. 

These situations trip me up nonstop. How do you deal with it? It's always this mentality that breaks my months-long streak of sobriety, and then... ya know.  I'm spiralling.

But there’s been many benefits to walking this path solo, like having to face all of the worst parts of myself. Getting honest with myself. Getting disciplined. Actually giving a damn about living another day. Tending to all the hurt I carry from the consequences of my past actions. Showing myself care and compassion.

It started in early 2017 I would wake up the day after drinking (8 hours after) and would feel like I was dying. This made me want to quit alcohol. If I would drink a lot of alcohol it would amplify the effects and I would feel like I was literally dying having a heart attack or something. Pretty much quit drinking mid 2019. Off an on would have a beer or a few and the symptoms persist. Fast forward to last weekend I felt like I was dying so I drank a couple beers and took some shots and felt relieved, (alcohol or Xanax always fixes this problem). I wake up 4-5 hours after drinking literally going crazy thinking I’m dying and felt like I was losing my mind. I’m not sure if this is alcohol or anxiety I haven’t drank since last Sunday.

It's not been a huge problem so far, however I am starting to think it may turn into an issue pretty soon and he'll leave. As of lately, I've turned into a pretty problematic drunk, causing dramas and arguments for no damn reason at all. Not to mention the many times I spent in bed (like today), saying I feel sick and I am unable to come online and spend time with him, due to withdrawals and hangovers. My health has been on a steady decline because of it too and I feel like if I do not stop, I may end up in a hospital very soon or worse... 

I simply do not know how I can do this. I feel powerless honestly. If I cannot do this for myself, I need to try and do this for him. I have spoken to him about this and he has been understanding and supporting so far, however I tend to hide how much I drink pretty much all the time. He doesn't know I consume basically a liter of hard liquor almost twice a week.

I feel like I am going to sabotage our future together. Alcohol is already robbing me of precious moments spent with him on a weekly basis. He has expressed several times of how much he fears for my life when I do this to myself and yet somehow I am unable to quit.

I have a 29 year old son , that no matter the treatment opportunities he gets he just goes backwards and throws away all his great plans to go ahead in his life clean.

Now he's on the street , where he keeps landing. This has to be the most fearful, heartbreaking time for me . Just lately he's gotten in worse situations 


All the phone conversations this past week. All the hope that he really wants better for himself.Today it's ending in all my tears. I will continue to pray and believe he will let go of what is holding him back. 
  
Sobriety is what I'm working on and I must keep my focus on it. I'm over it taking my life in wrong directions . I can't make my son do what he's not ready to do.

My partner and I were out with each other and I got frustrated with her for how she treats me in a grocery store (stupid on my part I know) but when we got home she was angry and it was because of things I lied to her about while drinking. I am sober now and just don't recall that I lied and hadn't talked with her about it yet. 

I told her anything she said was absolutely true and that it wasn't that I was trying to lie, just that I don't remember things like when I started, to when I stopped the binge. 

She was mad and probably still is, but now is sad and in bed with the lights off. 

I have apologized and just can't even fathom how she feels. I want to say it will never happen again, I am trying my best to change, etc but she has heard it so many times before I feel like it is a disservice to her to tell her those things even though it is how I feel. 

Never drink guys, not today, not ever. The damage it does to the people you love the most is unfathomable.

A year ago, I was malnourished, stressed out and miserable.  I was barely sleeping or eating, I smelled like an ashtray, and was barely holding things together at work.  I had elevated liver enzymes, high blood pressure and a resting heart rate in the 90’s.  I’m not sure how much longer I would have lived if I hadn’t stopped.

But I did stop.  I came clean with my doctor and a couple close friends and detoxed at home under medical supervision.  I didn’t sleep for at least a week, and probably didn’t sleep well for the first month, but things got better.  Within 3 months of stopping, my liver enzymes started to return to normal ranges.  After 4 months, I quit my 20 year, pack a day dependence on nicotine.  I started eating better and exercising, and now I sleep well.  My blood pressure is normal and my resting heart rate is in the low 60’s.  I’m not depressed anymore.  I’ve been promoted at work and over the last year I’ve saved thousands of dollars that I previously would have spent on booze and cigarettes.

I have previous experience with AA and it wasn’t a good fit for me — I think I probably drank harder and longer than I would have if I’d never been introduced to the 12 steps, but I acknowledge that AA has helped a lot of people.  Do whatever works for you, but know that people do get sober without attending meetings, working steps, or accepting some kind of ‘higher power’.  I barely think about alcohol now, and I never feel like I’m missing out.  I’ve been out to bars with friends and have had a good time drinking ginger ale or club soda and cranberry juice.  I have an open bottle of wine in my kitchen that I bought to cook with a month ago, and I don’t see it any differently than vinegar or molasses.

I’m grateful for everyone here.  This sub did help me a lot, especially at first.  If you’re reading this and struggling, know that I’ve been there too.  I don’t know how many badge resets I had to ask for, but it took me years to get to the point where I was really ready.  And when I was ready, quitting became possible.

Whether you’re on day 1 or day 10,000, congratulations on choosing a better life.  And thanks for just being here, it means more than you may understand.

Happy holidays.",31

Despite being with friends that are notorious drinkers, despite spouse and visitors bringing home alcohol and drinking while we hang out, and despite needing wine for recipes I'm cooking, I still haven't had a drink. I'm feeling really proud of myself, because I don't even have the desire, and am feeling so very good, this is the longest I've gone! 

Feeling frustrated because I showed my spouse my 20 day milestone, and he laughed at it. I've been waking up in the mornings feeling good and doing things, he made a snide comment yesterday about who am I and where is his spouse, and he keeps offering me drinks, despite me saying I don't want to drink any more. I made a decision in the first week that no matter how angry I get, or unsupported I am, or sad, I won't use that as an excuse to start drinking. I intend to follow through, but I am having a hard time not feeling demoralized with how my spouse is responding.

I am 22 days sober today.  No one in my life- not my family, not even my best friend knows how much I drink and that I’ve gotten drunk every night for the last 5 years. I’m single and live alone, so It’s been fairly easy to hide. 

My depression has come roaring in since I quit drinking. In the last 3 weeks of sobriety I have managed to alienate 3 people closest to me. I forgot (because I was sitting at home in a pity party of depression) to go to my goddaughters play at her school after I faithfully promised to go. I have irritated my co-worker with my new moodiness and general grumpiness. And the worst is last night I got into a fight with my best friend in the whole world. She was trying to give me advice and I lashed out at her. 

I read posts on here about newly sober people reconnecting with loved ones and starting to rebuild relationships. But it seems to be the opposite for me. Maybe it’s because no one knows (yet) that I’m newly sober and that is causing more tension for me.  I don’t know the answer. Has anyone else experienced this early on in their sobriety? I’m not giving up and I’m so proud of myself. Everyday I look at myself in the mirror and tell myself how proud I am. I love that feeling. But I never thought that I would struggle with my relationships like this. I guess I just wanted to put this out there because writing it all out helps me work it out in my head.",10

My post is different than some people. I don't feel bad today. I don't feel like I failed at life I'm not depressed. I didn't have a hangover. I successfully moderated but here is my advice for anyone else, it was a lot of work for not much joy. Carefully pouring just a shot mixing it with lots of water for hydration, and then repeating. That was such a delicate process that on top of learning to make sure my friends take anything they leave I'm learning I don't want to spend that much time worrying about what I drink or how much. I could chug 12 la Croix and not care. That's seems much easier. Poured the rest down the drain and continue on.",70

My life is a complete mess, SO left me after my last relapse, landlord is trying to evict me, bailifs are harassing me, started a new shitty job at a dogshit salary because i just had to get back on my feet, no friends left, internet will get cut off tomorrow, but at least im sober, healthy and trying to get back up.

While being Sober (TM) is not the most ""fun"" thing to be in a social setting, it definitely makes me the happiest in the mornings. 

My sleep is so much deeper, I don't wake up in the middle of the night, and I've had fewer nightmares. 

The one thing I find myself wishing daily is that my dad would find this group. Or any group that would help him find the same beautiful sobriety so many of us have here. It tugs at me daily knowing that he's still struggling with this damn drug... because of course he is. It's HARD. Sigh. 

I'm still working on crocheting my Recovery Blanket (almost done! Less than 1 skein left!). I've been drinking lots of coffee, sparkling waters, and tried Athletic Brewing NA beer on Thanksgiving. My step-dad and partner each had one with me and we remarked on how close to an actual IPA it is! 

I've got a friend visiting from out of town this weekend, and I'm looking forward to hanging out with them while I'm sober. I've redecorated my apartment and spent yesterday building a fuck ton of ikea furniture by myself (my biceps are ACHEY this morning).

Don't get discouraged at 30, 60, 90 days.","Everyone is different. We all had our own journey into our respective depths of alcoholism. And we all have our own journey back to the surface. 

My life is MUCH better, don't get me wrong. After 20+ years of daily drinking since my late teens, removing the constant presence of alcohol and the cycle of drink > sleep > sick > regret > need > drink has given me an entirely new canvas in which to live my life.

But this new canvas came with a whole host of issues. I spent all those years neglecting my mental and physical health and I've had to shoulder those needs as a part of learning to live life without the only coping mechanisms I've ever had. 

Medications have helped. While not perfect, it has made the chemical imbalance from decades of alcohol abuse more manageable on a daily basis. I'm still prone to bad days though. Therapy has also helped me understand my new, sober framework that I inhabit and what the inputs and outputs are.

Exercise has also helped. Not that I enjoy it immensely. But I've taken up hiking and going to the gym a few times a week. It gives me a feeling of accomplishment and active effort of improvement, something that helps when you feel worthless and lazy. 

If you're going on a few months and are still waiting for the ""big relief"", you're not alone. My recovery has been a roller coaster filled with ups and downs. There's been no moment of feeling ""in the clear"" of anything. 

So if you're reading posts here of lucky folks who feel AMAZING and LIKE A WHOLE NEW PERSON after quitting for 3 weeks and wondering if you're missing something... you're not. 

Literally every medical and mental health professional I've talked to on my journey has told me that it's not uncommon for recovery to take a year or even several years for people who have abused alcohol for a long time. 

So just keep plugging along. Because the alternatives aren't very appealing when you play that tape forward.",122

The fact that I don't need to drink every day doesn't mean I don't have a problem. I'm incapable of moderation and once I start drinking I simply won't stop.
It kinda snuck up on me and then I tried ignoring it for a while. Then I did all the silly gymnastics of ""a maximum of three beers"" or ""a large glass of water after every drink"".
Thursday I drank till 6 am, slept until the afternoon, woke up feeling like shit and went to a party. 
Left the party at 4am, met a friend, drank at his place, went back to the party at 8am, did a lot of coke and drank more, stayed there until 9pm, met a friend, slept for a couple of hours and went out again. 
Fortunately most pubs were closed by then so I only got one beer before finally going home.
I'm feeling absolutely terrible today, of course. 
Anxiety, shame, depression, self loathing.

This stuff has taken so much from me over the last few years, it has to end now.

Maybe one of you guys can give me a few pointers on how to approach this?
I'm confident that as long as I'm by myself I won't drink, never did that. But at some point there will be invitations, birthdays, parties. I'm scared to fess up towards my social circle, would definitely prefer to keep this under wraps for now. But maybe that's exactly the wrong idea, how could they know not to offer me booze if I don't tell them.

I don't want to be that person anymore, I don't want to hurt people I care about, this is going to end now.

Anyways, this is day 1 (actually tomorrow will be the real day 1 because I drank until around 5 or so).",6

Seriously struggling but making it. Barely. I hate the scheming taking up room in my head right now. The scheming from knowing how easy it would he to slip away and have a drink.

I’ve had a few bad issues with drinking lately, but the biggest issue really is that I’ve been hiding it from my wife. We’ve discussed it actually several times over the last couple years, and a few times it felt like it was sticking, but yesterday was different. Yesterday she came into the bedroom where I was sitting and I said I know what you’re going to ask me, you’re gonna ask if I’ve been drinking. She said yes and I looked her dead in the eyes and told her I had not been drinking. Well she had the receipts on this one. She had marked the whiskey bottle.

I just feel very stupid, I don’t know why I kept lying when she’s really been nothing but supportive to me. I’ve talked to the therapists about it, I’ve talked to my friends about it, and I’ve talked to my wife about it, and I haven’t gotten better. 

She’s currently not speaking to me, and I’m not trying to pester her. Trying to give her space. I am so scared that I may have permanently fucked this up. I want nothing more then to hold her in my arms and have her trust me, but how can I possibly ask that??

I had a good long talk with my sister and really close friend, I said the words I am an alcoholic to them. I’ve never actually said that to them before. I’m just really hoping that saying it out loud and telling other people maybe actually help me get the help I need to be held accountable. I hope I haven’t destroyed my relationship permanently but, I did attend an online AA meeting at 5 AM this morning when I couldn’t sleep. It wasn’t the right meeting for me, but it lead me down the road of looking up local meetings and other online groups including this one. I’m not even hung over because she caught me early yesterday and I did eat and drink water and just went to sleep. I didn’t sleep well, but I’m not hung over today and I will not drink today, so let’s start there.",17

I’ll spare the details, but I’ve been going through a lot here recently. It was innocent enough, my wife wanted takeout from a local Mexican restaurant, and she also wanted a margarita. So..I ordered one for myself.  Where I live, restaurants can do to-go drinks, provided they leave the restaurant in a sealed container. (Kind if like a soda bottle). 

When I got home, we opened the drinks, and the smell of alcohol was overpowering. I took a drink, and it definitely wasn’t what I remembered it to be. Even the buzzed feeling felt different. I did finish the drink, but barely, and I definitely didn’t want another one. 

To make a long post short, I’d spent the previous 55 days sort of white knuckling sobriety, I think. I had thoughts of drinking just about every day. When I finally said screw it and had a drink, it just wasn’t there anymore. I’m happy for that. This happened two nights ago, and honestly, I’ve felt better about not drinking for the past few days. I didn’t get up the next morning with anxiety from having a drink, just a clearer resolve to stay sober. 

If anyone out there is struggling like I was, I can assure you, it’s not worth it to go back. It really isn’t as good as your mind can make it out to be. 

I apologize for the long post.",84

Found a lot of useful advice on this sub.,"I manage to be more productive some days. Other days, I allow myself to slack off and just be, so I don't get overwhelmed with my own expectations. Most things are simply obvious, but were lacking in my life.

Everytime I get cravings I do something to distract myself. Here's all of the things I've been trying, which I read about on various posts and comments:

- Drink more water, and drink Gatorade or coffee when I'm craving a drink
- Eat regular meals, even if just a small snack even though I'm not hungry
- Regular sleep times
- Spend dedicated intentional time with family (playing board or card games, help clean the kids rooms, cook meals together, even just watching the kids favourite shows with them etc.)
- Read to each of my kids at least 2 chapters of their favourite book every day
- Joined AA and Smart Recovery
- Booked addictions counseling with a local program
- Excersize and stretch, even if only for 10 minutes
- Go for walks with no purpose other than enjoying fresh air
- Pick a basic house chore and make sure to complete it
- wrote a list of things I've procrastinated (like fixing a leaking sink, repair drywall dents in my house, organize closets etc.) and work through the list
- Sit down and just listen to my favourite music, without any other distractions
- Read books (I'm starting with The Naked Mind, then my reading list: Atomic Habits, Recovery: Freedom From Our Addictions, The Alcohol Experiment, The Addictive Brain)

It's crazy how intentionally doing productive things rather than just giving into the drink should be normal, but my normal was giving into the drink. I still feel brain fog and anxiety, but more so feel freedom and joy watching my life change for the better so substantially in such a short time.

My relationship with my wife, kids, and other family members has done a complete 180. Things haven't been so good in over a decade.

For anyone who read all of this, keep pushing to take control of your situations that you can. We can do this. If you have already, thankyou for continuing to be supportive for those of us who are working towards our freedom.",56

I'm 30 and I've been drinking in a very unhealthy way for around 6-7 years now. I kind of put off admitting I have a problem because I don't drink every day or through the day, but I also literally cannot only have one drink--every time I buy wine it's the whole bottle, every time I buy beer it's the whole six pack, etc. I hide how much I drink from people and drink in secret in my room on weekends, or do shot after shot after shot when I go out.

I'm also not a nice person when I'm drunk, I can scream and even get violent sometimes. I'm not using alcohol as an excuse for my behavior though--I have been aware that I'm like this when I'm drunk and I could have taken steps to sober up. I chose not to, so in a sense I still chose those actions, even if I would never act that way sober. It's crazy to me that I'm a totally different person, and I just don't want to be that person to people anymore.

Awhile ago I started to wonder if I should quit drinking. One of my friends started getting me beer or wine as a present to cheer me up and that's when it really started to sink in.

I don't miss it yet but I guess that's not a surprise since I didn't drink every day. The real test is going to be the next time I go out with friends and would normally get trashed.

I haven't told anyone, I actually have managed to hide my drinking almost entirely from most people aside from a few friends who are heavier drinkers than me, so I know they won't judge me. I know I should tell people for the sake of maintaining sobriety more easily, but I'm still kind of working up the courage, since part of it will involve admitting the I even drink at all. I also need to work up the courage to tell my doctor to make sure I haven't done any damage to myself medically, but that's going to be hard because she's so proud of me for how healthy a lifestyle I live otherwise (I eat lots of vegetables and exercise, my lipid panels are perfect, but I imagine they'll want to run some specific tests when they find out I binge drink often).

Right now, though, I'm just trying to focus on getting through the weekend.

Anyway thank you guys for being so sharing of your experiences and supportive of each other. Last night I really wanted to go out and buy a bottle of wine or something, and instead I just decided to read this sub until the urge passed. Sorry for the wall of text, I've just literally never told anyone ANY of this before and it feels good to say it somewhere. I don't expect anyone to read the whole thing tbh",18

I (24) call up a few of our friends and we plan dinner. We have dinner and my nephew had a couple of beers. I told him how I stopped drinking, and he said that his own path of drinking had gotten bad. He wants to slow down. His two beers was him slowing down, and I'm glad because he went home afterwards. He had to drive 10 hours today. My two friends got multiple mixed drinks at dinner and then we decided to go out. 

We go to the first bar and shoot darts and play pool. Both things we enjoy doing, they both drink a few more drinks. I designate myself as the DD, and so we go to a bowling alley bar next. We play a few sets and my friends are pretty drunk as the bartenders there make stiff drinks. 

The 3rd bar we go to is a country club we are members of. We go to see a bartender friend, get some really stiff drinks, and to eat a lot of popcorn (or at least that was what I was doing). We left this bar and went to a bar that's close to my house. We stayed here maybe 15 minutes, they took a shot, and we left to go see a friend at another bar. I stayed at the 5th bar for about an hour. I seen a lot of familiar faces there, and they were all surprised to see me not drinking. One of them was telling me about how he wanted to stop too, and was proud of me for stopping. I kept telling him I just started and I havent had any bad days yet, but I appreciated it. After this bar we went to our final one of the night. 

Throughout the night so far I didnt really feel any desire to drink. It just didnt sound fun, it didnt look fun, and I had the responsibility of being the DD. The 6th bar was the biggest and it was packed. I was having a lot of fun dancing and talking to people. My two friends were sitting at a table slumped and trashed. I decided to sit with them and give them hints that we could leave whenever. They kept on drinking. They were almost falling asleep before this guy came up to our table and started talking our ears off. He would leave and come back for about 30 minutes and keep reintroducing himself because he was also very hammered. Eventually this stranger told us three and another table sitting next to us that he bought a VIP couch and bottle service for us. Lol, so ten minutes later we all went up there because my friends didn't want to waste his money (which I agreed with). 

The presentation and stuff was pretty cool, I was having fun. My friends are very shy, so they didnt like being VIP because it was like a stage in front of the dancefloor. They didnt have much to worry about because they were slumped and sleeping on the couch in no time. The nice guy told us to do whatever with the three bottle he bought. So I made mixed drinks for the other people in VIP, was pouring shots in their mouths, and giving shots to people that weren't in VIP. I was somewhat tempted to make myself a drink, but then I looked at my friends and remembered that that was me last weekend. 

I wake my friends up to leave and they were mad at me and embarrassed. We get to the car and my friend who is probably blacked out decides he can drive. I'm not arguing with him, he gets like this every time he blacks out. So he drives us to his house, which is two blocks away thankfully. My other friend had been talking to a fwb since dinnertime, and apparently struck out because he waited too long. She told him to screw off around 1 I guess and he was starting to get angry and yelling. He said the anger sobered him up, and he decided to drive home which is 45 minutes away. I left my phone charger in my friends house, and I called him to see if i could get it, and my calls were ignored. These things are all expected from them, and normally my drunk ass would be driving off too. 

I didnt really want to go out this soon, but I wanted to prove to myself that I am done with drinking. So done. I had fun, but I dont think I want to go out anymore. I'm glad I remember everything, drove home safely, and feel amazing this morning. My friend snapped me when he made it home a picture of his vomit in his driveway. The roles were reversed last weekend, I was the shit show. I'm so glad those days are behind me. IWNDWYT!",9

This is going to be a tough one.,"Today is day 28! A lot to be thankful for right now. That being said, I'm still facing some of the demons from my drinking days. Today that demon is my old drinking room. A room down in my basement that was originally meant to be my music studio/theatre but has turned into the hidey hole where I would sneak beers and shooters. And I use the word sneak very lightly because my wife knew the entire time what was happening. We would drink together but I would buy extra beers and shooters and drink them secretly so it only looked like I was having a few. 

I haven't wanted to face this room yet but it's time. There are literally hundreds of empty cans, bottles and shooters in this room. A true testament to where I was then, and where I am now. I'm feeling very positive about my sobriety and I hope this brings even more closure to the man I was. My wife offered to help but in all honesty I'm embarrassed for her to even go in there and see the destruction. Just for clarification, my wife is one of those mythical beast who can have a couple glasses of wine and then not drink again for a week or two or longer. 

Anyway, it's my mess. My hole that I crawled into. Most importantly, the hole I crawled out of. Here's to moving on family. IWNDWYT!",242

So I'm attempting to break that cycle and using this post/reddit as a reminder and for a source of support. 

It has been 7 days, I feel superb, my skin looks great, I'm sleeping better despite some very vivid dreams and overall I feel so much better. 

I'm due to go out next Friday and I vow to stay sober. One of the girls that is going is also a non drinker so I'll drink coke with her whilst everyone else gets sloshed. 

If you fuck up again you're going back to AA and you know how much you hate it there, 4 meetings in and you'll start being told you're a dry drunk because you're an atheist. 

Also, next time someone upsets you, count to ten before responding, you don't want to go to prison for murder, you're too pretty. 

Also, remember your plan to get abs for the summer, you can't out train those additional 3000 empty calories a week from lager you massive prick.

Lifetime alcohol abuser. Every day since I was 27 buying a fifth of vodka every four-five days. Always had a good job, kept a nice home, garden, rode my horses… soooo easy to say I didn’t have a problem (don’t pay attention to those pesky hangovers!) Convinced that two double martinis before dinner was perfectly normal behavior.

I quit once (for a year) in 2015. After the first week I felt great and stuck with it. Moved back to a town in 2016 where I had childhood friends and they were all drinkers so I got right back into it 😕

Haven’t been feeling physically great the past few months even though I don’t drink any more quantity than I usually do. I am guessing I’ve probably done some damage to my liver and at my age probably not processing alcohol like I used to. My sleep has suffered greatly which doesn’t help.

Not to go into a long story about my life but it’s a bit of a mess. When I look back I often wonder if I would have made some of the piss poor decisions I made if I had been completely sober. I often wonder if I am trying to commit slow suicide by alcohol. I am wondering if alcohol just adds to my bleak state of mind.

Anyhow I’ve never been a quitter in anything I do. I know I am incredibly strong in many ways. I know my nature is normally a very happy and optimistic one. I feel like alcohol subverts the real me and keeps my brain full of endless noise instead of peaceful calm.

So this time I am a quitter again. Had my last drink on Thanksgiving. Didn’t sleep last Saturday night, today headache and nausea but so happy I made a decision to let my brain and body reach physical and emotional stability.

I don’t drink now but I still self sabotage,"Often times I used to drink to feel ‘control’ of my life. Finally got the kids down after a long day? Drink! Hate your job and dreading tomorrow? Drink! Not looking forward to xyz? Drink!

We all know how that story goes. Drinking doesn’t help you control anything… but if you try hard and long enough it sure starts to control you.

I’ve been sober for nearly 10 months now. It’s been great for all the reasons people talk about. I’ve been exercising 4-5 days a week for 5 months ago and also enjoying the benefits.

Lately though, depression has been creeping in at the margins of my life. It’s been causing things to get progressively harder and my general mindset to suffer. I’ve been annoyed about it. 

Like, ‘hey Depression, old enemy, what are you doing around here? I don’t know if you heard but I quit the hooch 10 months ago and am at the gym so often I’m on my way to looking like an Amazon goddess, and lots of life is great… sooooo who let you in???’

Now I’m not afraid to reach out to therapists and doctors for help and depression medications. I’ve birthed babies. I’ve gone through some rotten PPD and meds can be miraculous. 

However, this time around my depression isn’t caused by hormone imbalances or drinking so I wanted to know WHY it’s creeping back. The obvious answer is my business has been struggling. Things will turn around in a couple months for some great reasons but I’ve got to white knuckle it and do some hard things for the meantime. 

Before I would have started drinking more because I would have felt ‘in control’ and would have numbed my fear once I clocked off. I would have used the bottle to sabotage myself.

Now I’m left for hours with just my thoughts. My negative unkind thoughts I would never speak to anyone I care about. I’ve been basically opening the front door and setting out the welcome mat for depression just so I can inflict pain on myself. It’s been working.",41

June 2020 I go to my lady doctor for the 1st time in 5 years and have my pap come back irregular, multiple fibroids and hormone tests are all out of whack. I'm upset and probably drink about it. I hop on Google and start that dive on what is in my power to turn things around. #1 Stop Drinking.

So I start that, and it turns out I can't quit cold turkey cause I've got something going on with my intestines that is causing extreme pain. Top 3 pains of my life, right alongside baseball size ovarian cyst and covid headache. My best guess is SIBO as I was a daily drinker and having a shot would make the pain completely go away. So for a while there I considered myself to not be drinking anymore, however I occasionally, maybe a few times a week, would have a shot for the pain.

Fast forward to early 2021, I'm eating healthier, avoiding phthalates, seeing a functional medicine doctor, exercising, I enroll in school and I'm still drinking. I was drinking red wine occassionally at home, but if there was a special event, I would go and enjoy myself thoroughly into a severe hangover. Same friends, old habits die hard, yada yada.

Then this current semester starts and I've started losing interest in drinking altogether. No alcohol in the house for me at all. There's a restaurant I like going to once a month where the bartender makes a great Moscow Mule, I have 1-2 of those with dinner. When there's an event, even less often than once a month, I again pleasantly drink myself into a horrid hangover.

BUT LAST NIGHT it was my roommates birthday. I had every intention of going. Then I sat and thought about it. I don't actually want to go. It's not going to be a 1-2 drink night. It's going to be another night where I drink myself sick into tomorrow, which is terribly easier to do now, and it's going to ruin my one day off from work of my current 6 day work weeks. So, I did it, I said I'm not going and I didn't go. Part of me was actually worried I'd regret not going.

But I woke up 2 hours ago at 6:30am and I am SO RELIEVED AND HAPPY!!! I fed my sweet baby kitties, had coffee and breakfast, and soon I'm going for a hike with my mom for our belated Thanksgiving as I spent my Thanksgiving working on a class project. It's going to be a great day! #IWNDWYT",15

If it sounds familiar to you, you were probably old enough to remember it happening. It was the Taconic State Parkway crash that killed 8 people. Since it happened in my area I remember it being a huge deal for months and the media coverage was constant. But I kinda tuned it out at the time bc I was 19 and found it all very sad.

There’s a documentary(There’s Something Wrong With Aunt Diane) about said car crash in HBO and something made me want to watch it last night. I don’t know if this was a good or bad choice, because I was bawling my eyes out for much of the documentary. Basically, this woman Diane who crashed her car into oncoming traffic, had a BAC of .19 (equal to 10 drinks, near blackout level) and high levels of THC in her system. She killed herself, her daughter, her brother’s three kids, and 3 other people in another car. And all her family could do was deny anything about the autopsy/toxicology report was true.

They just kept saying, repeatedly, “I never saw her drink” “this wasn’t her” “she would never do this” “she was a perfect mother” “the report was mixed up”.. they had her body fluids retested AND analyzed by a word famous doctor who specializes in toxicology. And it all said the same thing, again - she was drunk and high at the time of the crash. 

People saw her puking on the side of the road about 2 hours before the crash. Her driving was insanely erratic for a long, long time for she crashed. They even found a vodka bottle at the scene of the crash and her husband repeatedly denied that it was in any way related to the crash.

The whole thing is just beyond heartbreaking, depressing, enraging, frustrating all at once. Addiction can happen to literally anybody and some people are scarily good at hiding it. My own father was a high functioning alcoholic and my friends were gobsmacked when I told them he was an addict. I guess Diane was one of them, and that we will never really know her true story.

In 2021 I relapsed. , Got blackout drunk again in September, scary, so I quit again but here I am again  Day One. So was only sober one month.

Both times I relapsed, my husband (who hardly drinks and can moderate) buys booze, convinces me that it's okay if we only drink when we're together, blah blah. I cave, drink only with him and that works for a bit, my drinking spirals, slowly gets worse.  I start sneaking alcohol in the house, hiding it, drinking more, etc etc  Then... epic fight with him, I drink until I black out. Don't even know what I did. 

Both times, when I relapse,  he gets in my face, calls me a drunk, etc, rages at me, calls my adult sons and told them I am an alcoholiic. Gets them all upset. Huge horrid drama. ""Your mom is out of control drinking"" etc 

I do not understand why he is not supporting my efforts to quit. Doesn't he have to accept SOME of the blame for my relapses if he buys the booze?  Also what is this crap calling my adult kids? I never drank when they were kids. It upsets them so much and I feel terrible. 

I am so angry at him. Of course, I'm angry at myself, he is not to blame for my inability to moderate, but for gods sake isn't a lot of this his fault, too? He gets to  lord it over me I failed, acting like a goddam martyr but this a-hole sabotaged me both times. I think he WANTS me to fail.

I woke up today and still feel hungover like I used to feel when I was 20 y.o. I'm only 29, never thought things would get so exponentially worse over such a short time. 

&#x200B;

I truly do not understand how I always end up forgetting about these horrible feelings after 4 or 5 days, and drink again. It is NEVER a good idea. Nothing good ever comes from it. The problem is, 1 in 10 night-outs are actually really fun, and no matter how senseless the other 9 are, I always chase that feeling. I've never had fun sober since I was a teen. Everything's meaningless and gray during the week, and then Friday comes, full of fake promises. I don't want to drink EVER AGAIN, FFS. NOT ONE SINGLE BEER!!! BUT IT NEVER STOPS!

&#x200B;

Some people here, me included, say that these ""drunk friends"" aren't good for me. The thing is... I am the drunk friend. No one gets as drunk as me. Everyone around me is able to stop after a few drinks, except me. The things we do are actually fun, even if there weren't alcohol involved. But I can't participate in them if I'm not drunk. We gather around for jam sessions, freestyling, talking and laughing about actually interesting things. I've got really great friends the past years, but I'm still in the mindset I ""inherited"" from my old, toxic friends (drink like it's a competition, smoke weed till we pass out, repeat). I can't get over this fucking disgusting mindset. I've suffered its consequences thousands of times, and it was never worth it. I am aware of this even when drinking, but I simply don't stop. I start fantasizing about ""all the fun"" we'll have if we're all drunk. Mostly fantasies of hooking up with someone (which I don't remember ever happening while sober :/). So yeah, it might come down to a pathologized perception of my own loneliness. Haven't had sex or kissed a woman since before COVID, and I'm not a bad looking guy at all. I have all sorts of talents, I've got a master's in clinical psychology, I'm funny and charismatic (or so people say), have a loving family, and possibly a good future ahead of me in several aspects. However, this all seems worthless when it comes to human relations. I go back to being the nerdy, shy, paranoid 16 year old I was before I found out that alcohol takes that all away for a few hours. Oh how I fucking hate this drug and myself. But at least I haven't smoked weed for almost a week (did it EVERY SINGLE DAY for the past 12 years). I feel like I can't leave the house unless it's for drinking again and socializing drunk. 

&#x200B;

Just a rant that I had to get out there. Thank you for this community, as it's helped me to (at least) only drink once a week, instead of 3 times. It has changed my life. However, I know deep in my heart that alcohol is just me delaying fixing all these anxiety problems, and I'm just fooling myself. I'm just scared that I'll end up alone if I eliminate this crutch from my life. I'm afraid I'll go back to being a fucking loser wasting my life playing videogames, not wanting to go out even for coffee, and just run away from people forever, like I always did before alcohol took control over my life.",6

Seriously though, one thing I’ve found in my brief streak is that goal posts, while great, can be a bit of a let down. No one’s throwing me a ticker tape parade or baking me a cake. So a nice self hug suffices then on to the next sunrise.
Secondly, one of the funner things of counting days is finding out interesting facts about numbers when you look them up. Especially the overlooked ones, prime, Fibonacci, Area 51, etc.
Here’s what 68 (an Angel number apparently) gave me, and it’s apt and beautiful and perfect for the Sunday after Thanksgiving, when so many have struggled, persevered, dusted themselves off and recommitted to Day 1s. 

“The meaning of 68 reveals that it is good to take a break once in a while and treat yourself to something that is not strenuous. You should be able to take care of your body in order to achieve all that you want to achieve in life. Ensure that you are happy and healthy for you to be of importance to yourself and your loved ones. Once your body is healthy, then you can be able to work on your dreams diligently and with determination. You should have an intention in life. Do not just live your life for the sake of living it.”",10

Being sober is the second best thing I ever did with my life. Some days It's very mediocre, everyone is not drinking vodka at 6am in the morning, big whoop! Other days it's like my whole brain has been rewired- you mean.... I actually enjoy spending time with my FRIENDS when I go out and not just looking for the next drink? AND shit, did I really do that? Get anxious when my glass is half empty? Fudge.

I am also learning that feeling my FEELINGS isn't always a great thing. It's my birthday I should be all cake and laughter, instead, I am a bit sad. My husband bought me a book called ""Blackout"", and I cried. Whilst I know it's his attempt to understand, it felt like a gut punch. I wanted to read This Naked Mind. I want to learn and grow, not reflect on the shame.

So today.  Well today dear Stop Drinkers I have to learn how to celebrate without wine or vodka or fizz. I have to dance sober.

But you know what? I am going to dance.

I am here. Alive. Fitter. Thinner. Stronger. Not wiser! Still an emotional mess. But I am sober. And fudge everything else, today is my birthday and I will DANCE! 

Have a good Sunday. I couldn't have got to 6 months without this community. Thank you.

I have been lurking on Reddit for about two years, never had an account and basically just browsed r/all for distraction.

In the past I used to enjoy having a couple of beers over the weekend while relaxing with friends, and I wouldn't say it was a problem at the time. More recently I have been under a lot of pressure at work, and with the pandemic dragging on, I have gotten into a habit of taking comfort in using alcohol to calm my nerves at the end of a rough day, no friends to share it with.

It has gotten to a point where I routinely drink a six pack every day of the week, more or less. Alarm bells have started ringing in the background, but quietly. It was only this last week that the foghorn sounded, when I woke up on the kitchen floor in a pool of my own piss. This is a sub-optimal way to live...

Having come across r/stopdrinking I have decided to create a Reddit account and start interacting with all you wonderful, supportive people :)

It was a co-worker's birthday and we were all in a bar. Nobody knew I had concretely decided to stay sober since the last time we drank. I’ve always brought it up casually and lightly in jokes Because I was too embarrassed to fully admit and say that I had a problem. Fast forward to the bar, they were all thinking of splitting a cocktail tower and i told them i don’t drink anymore and they all kept pressuring me and throwing tasteless jokes at me until i gave in and said fuck it i can always start the clock again.

I know it’s weird that I didn’t put my foot down and set actual boundaries with my coworkers. but allow me to explain a bit. I grew up overseas and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. the people there I met who were closest to me were considered family. Like, kick down a door to pull a noose off your neck family. I couldn’t bond, trust or talk to anyone else outside that circle Ya know. That part is relevant because in 2020 I left that place to do my 2 years of mandatory military service in my birth

Country. I’ve spent a whole year here and I still can’t find people I can relate to or trust. The co-workers I hang out with from the unit only know the surface level of me and I hang out with them cause there’s nothing else waiting for me at home ya know, plus I'm kinda stuck with them until my service is done. They’re shallow and sheltered individuals who do not share the past I do. I know it's really fucked up to say but I see them as placeholders. They’re kinda just there until I can find a better group to hang with. And for a good reason too,  these guys are genuine assholes. so it makes it even more frustrating and embarrassing to hand them another reason to belittle and humiliate

I wanted to stop drinking cause every time I do I make a goddamn fool of myself. a total and utter embarrassment that would be the talk of the town all week. My behavior and actions were the absolute complete opposite of who I am when I’m sober. I become the “hey look at me “ guy. I become the person you point at with your friends and laugh at not with. And the morning after i am faced with regret and shame. And what hurts the most is the “oh my god remember what you did??” Those words sear and banish me into a pit of shame. Before i came back to my birth country i was drinking every day but i was by myself. I had some unresolved trauma and pain that i was not ready to deal with. Back then I didn’t consider it a problem. I was just being a kid ya know? i didn't know that having 3 cans of room temperature beer and a stale cigarette for breakfast was a big deal or the fact that i had a mountain of empty whisky bottles hidden in my closet. It wasn’t until I went to see a therapist, she broke it down for me and that's when I acknowledged that I had a drinking problem.

I was sober for 6months until last night. and the fucking guilt and shame is tearing me apart. i can’t describe it it's like anxiety and depression mixed with some other form of panic. I want to run from this feeling but the feeling is inside me and i can’t run away from my own brain. I am embarrassed and scared to face my co-workers on Monday. But most importantly i am ashamed of letting my friends down overseas. The people i call family know about my drinking problem and have had to deal with my bullshit for the better part of a year, and i had just promised them 6 months ago that i would be sober for good. The fucking feeling of guilt and shame is searing harder than it's ever seared before and i don’t know what to do, i don’t know how to make it stop and that’s why I’m making this post.  I've been listening to podcasts about relapsing and tried googling for shit but none of them are working. If there's anyone out there that has advice or just anything to help stop this fucking feeling I’d appreciate the help.

TLDR; I've relapsed after 6 months of sobriety and the shame and guilt is killing me and i need to make it stop",8

Not even 3hrs of being home, she ended up falling off the couch , seizing and flopping everywhere,,, we called 911. She coded twice on the way to the hospital and once more whne they took her back for surgery to find the issue.. 

The issue was her fucking doctor, who I can not name for legal reasons...., did not secure her artery all the way, so my mom slowly bled internally. She ended up coding too many times to where she didn't get enough oxygen to her brain. She was declared brain dead the same day after her gallbladder surgey. She was in ICU from Dec 11th to Dec 24th, we kept her on life support praying for miracles , but she passed on Christmas eve around 10pm 2020.. 

It was just my mom,  my dad and I. Just us 3. Im the only child. I turned 21 this year, she wasn't here for it. I lost my mom unexpectedly at 20 years old. She was only 47. 

I never in my life thought I would see someone pass so soon, let alone actually see a person go so fucking cold and stiff.  Right after her heart stopped, not even 5mins later she went so fucing cold, she got so stiff to where I couldnt hold her hand in fear i would break her bones... I never felt her that cold before,  even in the cold winters we have.. she was gone. My mom , my best friend, the person everyone needs in there life and I had to watch her leave her body , her soul be released and she was just literally.. a body.. the nurses were kind enough to allow my mom to stay in the room before they really needed to move her to the basement.. 

and thats when I took my final nap and cuddle with my mom,, but she was gone.. I only had 2 hours with her and from crying so much , being there 24hrs a day I was drained..  I actually fell asleep for 2 hrs with my Moms body.. then the nurses woke me up and they *had* to take her down5, where its cold enough for her.. 

I started drinking the day everything happened.. I was staying the night in the hospital 24/7 and to just see your mom or someone you love like that, just unresponsive,  eyes are permanently dialated, no nervous system responses, no stable blood pressure or oxygen levels . Just nothing. As if she was just gone that same day it all happened.. 

I don't know how to deal with this .. I hate myself so mych. I know Im disappointing my mom and dad but I just don't know how to even live without my mom not being there everyday anymore . The fact I laid with her body, she was just so fucking *stiff* I will neverget  that out of my head ... I never in my life imagined I would have to do that... I am beyond traumatized.

  I only drink alcohol straight,  no point in making drinks. I have over 25 empty bottles under my desk that I can't throw away because my dad could see them (  *I am legal of age , Im 21yrs old* ) I just hate for my dad to know I've been doing this to myself which is why I hide the bottles..

I need help,, someone please help me",29

Instantly I was on uber eats trying to order a bottle of wine. (Lucky I was talked out of it)
Instantly I felt like I was missing out. 
Instantly lost my general days feeling of peace. 
Instantly. 
I know I did it as a form of escape too - I woke up feeling great this morning, a few things happened that kind of ruined my day and the reason I drank was because I was feeling uncomfortable and didn't feel like sitting with my emotions...
Spoiler alert it made my uncomfortable feelings worse.
Would not reccomend. 

My badge is incorrect. I only had 7 days. Im being kind to myself and moving forward.

I don't know if the alcohol was masking my anxiety or if it's alcohol withdrawal. If I go longer than 18 hours without drinking, I'm almost guaranteed to have a panic attack. Which causes me to drink to calm down. 

I know how to stop panic attacks, I know all the breathing and grounding techniques. Alcohol just calms me down the rest of the way. I'm no stranger to panic attacks, I used to have severe anxiety but my anxiety hasn't been too bad for the past year. But these ones are really sudden and there's no reason for them.",7

\-- keeps bringing up me raising my voice ‘yelling’ on weds before leaving for home for thanksgiving -- explained I raised my voice (tho no excuse) out of frustration bc he told me evything a girl woudlnt want to hear @ dinner last weekend @ dinner (doesnt know if he wants to marry me, if he will ever/is able to fully trust me in the future & get to a place where we are ready to take next steps)

That night by end of walk home after dinner: asked him if he were me, what he would do, he responded he didn’t know. Asked him if he can ever fully trust me again/will be able to, says he doesnt know if hes being completely honest. Asked him if he will be able to be there for me in the future if a family event like a death were to happen again, said he didnt know... lots of “I dont knows”

Earlier, @ dinner, he went into a one-sided convo - talking at me essentially while I sat there and listened to let him air his grievances - explaining how he believes how I would react if he were to break up with me “hypothetically.” Strongly believed I would phsycailly throw a fit -- throw things, cause a scene (as I have done in the past while drinking - was very volatile, etc) , then went into saying how it was wrong for me to have texted the woman (Sarah) that he saw/took to dinner in Austin. Then followed up by saying b/c of that he feels as though I would reach out to his ‘next girlfriend’ and bad mouth him. I said I would not react like that now. I would react by saying ok, asking for a reason Why (he wants to break up) and hope that he would give me an hour to pack a suitcase of clothes & toiletries until I am completely moved out. He said he was surprised to hear this and that it was “mature” of me - that its not something that he would’ve expect of me, at all. Find this surprising as I have brought more peace than chaos over these past 8+ months. He is the one who has welcomed chaos and betrayal -- meeting multiple women during a business trip just this past may - one of which he kept in touch with enough so that he flew out to Austin again at the end of June for a few days to meet up with her and take her out to dinner and tried to kiss her (as she told me via text when we connected after my finding out that he was in Austin, and not in DC - where he told me he was traveling to visit his mom who lives there.

This trip to Austin was also days leading up to father’s day, where I invited him to celebrate it with my dad & family and of course, insisted that he go see his mom in dc instead as that is more important, as family is everything.

This trip was also just 3.5 months into my newfound sobriety.

3.5 months, where I was under the impression/understanding that we were on the mend from all the past turmoil (betrayals on both ends, and general arguing, chaos, etc) - that I admittedly more so invited into our relationship. He even went to the extent of calling me a ‘complete joy’ since I had stopped drinking. And, we also chatted before his trip , agreeing that our relationshp was in a good place and growing and acknowledged & agreed that our relationship could not really bear any more betrayals from either of us.

Flash forward, during walk home, I said it seems as though he has thought thru a break up more than a future w/ me , his response was that he had of course thought that thru more as he was close to breaking up w/ me before I got sober 8+ months ago b/c things were so bad

I reiterated these conversation highlights form the night above to my sister, lilli , the next day and she said... ‘wow, what are u going to do?” I said idk I feel like he says things to test me / seek drama/reaction/chaos that I commonly brought whilst drinking. Perhaps he misses that chaos, or that fight for him - the proclamations, or begging of forgiveness, etc. Lilli thinks that it was “disrespectful” for him to even mention a future girlfriend hypothetically when we have been dating for this long.

He doubles down on anything I do - e.g., this past Wednesday right before leaving for my family’s home for thanksgiving -- I raised my voice, and expressed my apologies more than once after his frustration with my raised voice. I explained how I only raised my voice, not that it makes it right, because I was being met with resistance and denial of what he said during and after our dinner just last weekend. He said that it was all “hypothetical.”

I am back from thanksgiving, and he is still bitter and closed off. Its as though he was to sit in opposition and distance. He is quick to react, and he brought up me “raising my voice” before I left for my family’s on Wednesday again. And I went into apologizing and saying the same thing as I did right before I left Wednesday - that I only raised my voice, didnt “scream/yell” out of frustration bc he “doesnt know” about me and said “I dont know” to everything.

Its been almost 5.5 years since we’ve started our relationship. We are stagnant and he knows it.

Is the answer in his indecision and absence of answer?

He also is prioritizing his work (he is a ceo/founder of a very quickly growing tech startup so I respect his work and the demands) over my mother’s birthday dinner which is tuesday night since he has an important meeting with his board this week. i asked him if he will know by tomorrow if he can make it and he said yes if the board deck is done. He has known about this date for at least 3-6 weeks. 3 is on the generous side. Its been many more.

What. Do. I. Do.

I feel like im being gaslit, but also feel like I deserve his indecision about having a future with me with bigger things (engagement, marriage... but simply just seeking any sort of Growth - like even communicating effectively on a more consistent basis.....)

I say I feel I deserve that because I betrayed him many times before my sobriety. Not that he hasn’t betrayed me before this Austin trip. But he has a very hard time letting go and forgiving. I just really seek that forgiveness I try to offer him.

I am nervous because I try to talk to him and im leaning to you guys because I just need some perspective other than my therapist, friends, sister.

I feel like I hold onto the hope of what i know we could be",16

*We may be anonymous strangers on the  internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but  we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding  what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily  commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender  or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*.  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes  impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person  can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again.  And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not  drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

Good morning and Happy Sunday everyone. This is my first time hosting  the Daily Check-In and I feel a little nervous because I’m stepping out  of anonymity and into a world of being “seen,” or another way of  putting it, having my words being read by all of you. 

During my years drinking, the increasing amounts of alcohol I drank  numbed this feeling of nervousness and so many other feelings. Alcohol  also led to worse feelings like self-loathing and hangovers. The day I  most wanted to drink since August (when I quit drinking) was to numb the  grief I felt at the passing of a friend. One of my drinking triggers is  wanting to run away from strong and uncomfortable feelings and I also  tend to isolate myself. When that happened in the past, things got worse  – more drinking and depression.

This group, the moderators, and the members have made the difference  in my ability to not drink. Thank you Overbeingoverit for your wonderful  posts this past week, I especially loved this line from your post  yesterday “. . .we should all of us be trying to break out of these  cells that we put ourselves or find ourselves in, so that we can help  each other mend our broken hearts.” And thank you SaintHomer for  allowing me this opportunity to pitch in and serve. 

To begin the week, here is a poem I discovered while listening to  Pádraig Ó Tuama’s Poetry Unbound podcast.  The poem has made the rounds  since then, even appearing here on Reddit, but I don’t think in this  sub. It describes a feeling I recognize, of having missed out on some  important information.  And yet, if I can just slow down enough and pay  attention, it’s there for me, the knowing of the things that bring  meaning and just maybe, happiness. Have a wonderful week, everyone. I’ll  see you here tomorrow and IWNDWYT. 

**What You Missed That Day You Were Absent from Fourth Grade**

*Written by Brad Aaron Modlin*

Mrs. Nelson explained how to standstill and listen  
 to the wind, how to find meaning in pumping gas,

how peeling potatoes can be a form of prayer. She took  
 questions on how not to feel lost in the dark

After lunch she distributed worksheets  
 that covered ways to remember your grandfather’s

voice. Then the class discussed falling asleep  
 without feeling you had forgotten to do something else—

something important—and how to believe  
 the house you wake in is your home. This prompted 

Mrs. Nelson to draw a chalkboard diagram detailing  
 how to chant the Psalms during cigarette breaks,

and how not to squirm for sound when your own thoughts  
 are all you hear; also, that you have enough.

The English lesson was that *I am*  
 is a complete sentence.

And just before the afternoon bell, she made the math equation  
 look easy. The one that proves that hundreds of questions,

and feeling cold, and all those nights spent looking  
 for whatever it was you lost, and one person 

add up to something.",294

I hung out and had a great time with everyone without a drop of alcohol and couldn’t be happier about it. I’m leaving these gatherings and knowing exactly what happened the entire night. This is awesome.

It felt like a gut punch, because my life since November 2019 has been a fucking train wreck. 

I’ve been miserable for literally years. What is wrong with me? Why am I miserable fuck? I’m wasting my life. 

It’s sad that I’ve wasted years of my life doing nothing. Stuck in this cycle of alcohol abuse.

We used to drink together and stay up through all hours of the night and they were around for some of my worst periods in drinking and depression. 

Today we’d scheduled a hang out–I picked the afternoon so that their drinking would be less prominent. Unbeknownst to me, one of them had invited a fourth person who they *knew* annoyed me. The fourth person would be arriving about two hours after me.

Once they informed me of this, I was able to decisively pick a time to leave and stick to it. I was direct with them about why I didn’t want to be there anymore and avoided having to interact with the obnoxious fourth person. If I’d been drinking, I would’ve stuck around and suffered through it, whether that’s because I’m more suggestible when drunk, because I’d want to keep the drunk going, because the issue with driving/finding a ride, or because I feel more confident and in control while sober and have developed things I want to do solo in my own time.

So the core of it, I just noticed that I feel more confident and emotionally self sufficient sober. Better at putting up boundaries and saying the most important word in the english language: “NO.”",24

I can’t connect with my own generation (26M). I feel like I was either born in the wrong decade, or I’m on the spectrum, or simply low IQ. I. Don’t. Know.

The only thing I do know is that alcohol is the worst, best thing that has ever happened to me. It ruins me, but without it I would be at the mercy of my intense loneliness. I would have to realize I’ve aged out of adolescence in a drunken stupor; that I haven’t had a meaningful friendship in over 8 years. I once found pride in being a lone wolf, being able to get by with my own devices and that alone.

But, I immediately left. I told my boyfriend what was going on, and made a polite exit. I did not even entertain the thought of drinking, just thought of getting out of there immediately. We went to get pizza instead. 

I am surprised at how strong the urge to drink was. I watched everyone else and wanted to feel less anxious. I am so glad I had the sense to get out of there instead and just not be around it. 

Especially since I am four months and 2 days sober. I didn't want to break that streak, it is the longest I have ever lasted. I usually don't make it past a month. If I even try at all. 

I just wanted to vent about tonight. I am going to AA tomorrow. I am still working on staying sober, and not giving in to the urges. I've honestly never felt more level headed, or clear minded being sober. It is also helping me learn to regulate my moods more. I am also glad I avoided the guilt and the hangover. 

I am going to go enjoy my pizza now.

I kept going back to see them, and drinking through the pain of it, letting it get to me and coming out the other end feeling exhausted and upset, with my self esteem in tatters. 

Today I am here sober, for the first time in about 10 years, and today for the first time I had the thought- “maybe this is not my fault. Maybe they are unhappy and it isn’t something I have done wrong. Maybe I don’t have to put the blame on myself today.” And I don’t think I would have got there if I was drinking.

This morning I woke up, with the usual hangover full of regret, defeat and a black eye. And a healthy bunch of fear. Last night was just another episode in my alcohol fueled book of horrors. I have spent the majority of my morning trying to piece together the events, which many if you must know is a bit like searching for your glasses in the dark. it didn't take me long, however, to remember the ride home in the back of the police paddy wagon.

I'm a few months shy of turning 30. Which means that I'll have officially spent more of my life drunk then not, having starting my career with the bottle at 14. It's been a career of poor decisions and good luck. How I'm still alive to even share this boggles my fragile state of mind..

I'm tired. Of all of it. 
I am here because I want community. I know it's vital for change, as I've never been able to maintain a grog free existence by myself. 
Too long have I been a fly on the wall.. desperately hoping for answers and solace whilst hiding behind my screen.. So, here I ask. Do anyone of you admirable souls have any suggestions for what could help maintain sobriety during the first month of abstinence? I will be detoxing responsibly, that part doesn't scare me as much as the following time after that. 

What worked for you? All suggestions welcomed and appreciated!",15

If you are a door attendant and you’re managing to stay sober... holy shit you are amazing. I’m an attendant at a thrift store and the absolute ABUSE we receive sometimes is baffling. It honestly takes a toll on your personal strength and tests your morals a bit ahah. It also is really testing my sobriety. I swear, I never really want to drink on my own anymore. I occasionally crave beer, but not the effect. But sometimes I will have someone cuss me out and I start wishing I had a drink. Then I punch a cardboard box that’s going to get tossed, say a few choice words, breathe and drink some water, then go back out and continue my job. A couple of rude fuckers are not a valid reason to drink. Sure, the mentality it leaves me in sometimes is similar to how I would’ve treated myself a couple months ago. But I realize what sad, sad people they are for harassing me for doing what I’m told, for doing my job, hope they feel like shit later for acting like an entitled brat. I’m young, I’m usually about 25-40 years younger than the people harassing me. They think I’ll just take it. Nope. 

If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that I don’t need to drink to have courage or to speak my mind, to stand up for myself. This job has really put me in a good place honestly. It has given me situations where I’ve had to stand up for myself, for my coworkers, say no, etc. I am still learning to not be walked all over but it feels good knowing that my worth is not what other people think of me or how they treat me. It’s how I treat myself and honestly? I’ve been pretty damn kind to myself for the first time in maybe my entire life. And I feel a lot better for it. I’m happy I’m sober and I’m glad I’m not black out drunk by now like I would’ve been two months ago. The sky was gorgeous tonight and I used to miss out on seeing the sunsets.

Last weekend my husband got black out drunk and told me he wanted a divorce, was not good to me, etc. He’s typically a pretty good husband and father but he’s a mean drunk. He told me early on that day that he wouldn’t drink hard alcohol because he knows how he gets, but he did it anyway and I ended up being the target of his anger. 
He didn’t remember the night or what he said but he was filled with shame and regret and says he’s not going to drink again. 
I am just left wondering if the things that people say when they are drunk are their true feelings. I don’t ever drink like that, black out, get mean, so I can’t relate. I’m wondering if I am with someone who hates me. He swears he doesn’t feel that way but I’m not sure if I believe that.",8

I've started meditating every day with the help of an app (7 day free trial is almost over, so I guess I'll have to start paying for it, it's very helpful), and I'm more focused on eating healthy and losing a bit of weight, although I slip up on that one every now and then.

Last night I ordered pizza as a bit of a treat for myself. Pizza was always my go to food when I was drinking, and after eating a couple of slices I honestly felt disgusting. I've saved the rest of it to maybe eat today, not sure yet. It wasn't cheap so I don't want to just throw it in the trash, but that's probably where it belongs. 6 months ago I would have eaten the whole thing and washed it down with 8-12 beers....

I did fine over Thanksgiving, then today after work I started thinking about drinking.

I've been trying to ask myself what I'm trying to avoid when I get a craving.

I think what I'm trying not to feel is frustration with a coworker. I'm someone that if I know something needs to be done, most of the time I'll do it. No point in staying late bc I was farting around all day. My coworker, when there's not a boss around, likes to put things off and chit chat. I ended up doing more of the daily tasks than was fair today and even though I don't mind doing them, I think I do mind feeling like my work ethic is being taken advantage of. So I'm probably angry that I let it happen, and feeling conflicted about ""tattling"" about it bc I don't want to sound whiny or as if I mind doing the work itself, which I don't. It's double awkward bc the coworker has been there longer than I have and has been nominally on charge on days there's not an actual boss there, so there's a weird power dynamic where I don't feel comfortable speaking up in the moment.

Drinking definitely isn't going to fix any of that. I can focus on my own day, which was actually pretty good other than the low grade irritation about things. And I can decide how I want to phrase things to my boss later, or type up a letter about it to get my feelings out now. Either way, I don't need to let someone else's choices ruin my night or my sobriety, dammit.

EDIT: And I did try to speak up at one point, come to think of it. They told me to start on one thing and I asked if they could do another while I was doing that. They said, ""Oh, that can wait, it's not a problem."" So I wound up doing the other thing as well.",5

I knew I had a great time, but not much more than that. 

Well last night, I met my wife in the city(after I had been at my first sober bucks party/bachelor party/stag do), and we enjoyed a beautiful, excessive dinner. I didn’t embarrass her or myself. Then we walked town around a little, and headed on home for our very first child free sleep since the birth of our daughter nearly 2 years ago. 

I had big ideas about sleeping in, but I woke up early to a beautiful morning so I took my dog for a walk and thought about how immensely grateful and truly happy I am.

I drink more than I should, sometimes I get drunk but not as much these days, and if I do it's usually on a weekend. My drinking isn't impacting my job, my family, or my friendships. If anything, not drinking would make it more difficult to find new friends and meet out with old friends. I don't drink everyday, or even every other day. No DWIs, no money problems, no doing stupid things and making a fool of myself, and I still remain relatively active and healthy.

My problem is that now that I'm in my mid-30s, even if I don't get drunk I'm not at my best the following day after drinking. I push myself harder in the gym than I ever have before, but I'll never reach my fitness goals as long as alcohol is in my life. I am also single, and to be completely honest, *very* lonely and *very* bored. I try to balance out my life with healthy activities like hiking, interim sports, running clubs, etc., but now that winter is coming, I have less options for these kinds of things. My next go-to activity was to always head over to the pub and grab a drink, which always turns into 2-3+ drinks and a bunch of junk food. Gym progress and money earned, washed down the drain, and for what?

I'm drinking just to get out of the house, but not getting plastered to numb my feelings. Just to occupy myself and not be bored. I read the stories here of hitting rock bottom and I almost wish I was there just to give me the motivation I need to write it off forever. It's like.. while some of you are in alcoholic hell, I'm in alcoholic purgatory, which comes with its own unique set of problems and is still very difficult to get out of.

Edit: Thanks for responses everyone. I don't know that anything said here was particularly moving enough that makes me honestly think I'll put the bottle down for good, but who knows. I just finished cooking a dinner that would normally be paired with a nice glass of wine, but today thanks to being actively engaged here, I went for Perrier instead. I have yet another lonely and boring Saturday evening ahead of me, but this one will be sober.",30

2021-11-27 15:16:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r3lwav/identity_and_sobriety/,Identity and Sobriety,"This is my first post on reddit. I feel insecure and feel myself resisting posting anything at all. After 10 years of light to moderate habitual drinking and periods of regular binge drinking. I have intentionally tried to stay sober for the past 3.5 weeks hoping to break a deeply ingrained habit. I was sober at family thanksgiving for the first time since I was 18yrs old and I was/am all spun up in my head about it. 

I've come to realize that I drink because it numbs the anxiety and depression. I am convinced that since I am high functioning (I also numb my feelings be working... workaholic vibes) and not drunk every minute of the day I don't deserve to identify as an alcoholic. In the past 10 years I have maybe taken 1 month off of drinking just to prove I don't have a problem only to turn around and drink at every acceptable chance I get. 

As I stated above, this experiment with sobriety is in hopes to break the habit. I had been feeling the brain fog more in the past year. Feeling like I was just existing to drink my beers each night and wake up, get through the next day to do it again. I was feeling more and more disconnected from myself. My identity feels wrapped up in beer. Friends and family I assume barely know me without a beer, shit I barely know myself without a beer. Feeling lost, confused, and numb I figured I should lean into my curiosity of sobriety.  As I have been sober for 17 days and a 10 day stretch before that. I now can't help but attribute every thought and feeling to the fact that I am not drinking a couple beers every night. 

Honestly still feeling very disoriented being sober. It's a really great change in many ways. But I am still feeling the negatives - brain fog, heightened anxiety, heavier depression, irritability, physical fatigue, my sleep hasn't improved, I have more headaches than when I was drinking, loss of appetite, and I don't really want to be around people. I am grateful I have a very supportive partner but I feel ashamed that mostly being sober feels like shit. Being drunk feels like shit too. I want to ride it out and see if being sober eventually will feel better. I didn't think I had cravings for beer, but damn I have wanted to drink so bad the last week and non-alcoholic beer is subpar and makes me feel so full. 

I feel like I am rambling on, if you are still reading this I appreciate your time and attention, I don't know what I am looking for here. I feel alone, as if my addiction isn't ""bad enough"", I want to feel and be myself again, I don't want others to feel like I think I am better than them because I choose sobriety (further isolating myself), I want to confidently live by my convictions and I guess I am trying to identify what those are.

One of my biggest issues has always been being afraid to ask for help. But it has also been my biggest hindrance in getting and staying sober. I am TERRIFIED of showing (what I perceived to be) weakness. I learned it from my career military father, and I do NOT want to end up like him: so shut down emotionally that he can’t even show affection to his own kids.

But guess what? The anxiety of doing it is way worse than the act itself. Here’s how I know: In the past few weeks, I’ve pushed myself to do it, and each time, I was amazed at the reaction I received.

I reached out to an outpatient addiction center, which I was terrified to do. They’ve been amazing; helped me with medication-assisted detox at home, and have called to check up on me. 

I finally came clean with my PCP about how much I drink. I went in to get a physical on Wednesday, and it all came pouring out. Instead of “You should know better”, I received nothing but kindness and support from her. I felt an ENORMOUS sense of relief coming clean about it to her.

Anyway, I urge you to ask for help if you need it. People’s reactions may just pleasantly surprise you. In my more depressed moments, I start thinking that there’s no kindness left in the world. I’ve now proven twice to myself that that’s not true.

So I’m confused why these keep happening. Has anyone else experienced this? Or can maybe shed light on why & how I can stop them?",9

I made a quick run to the grocery for something I didn't *really* need but convinced myself that I did; I told myself that I wasn't going to buy alcohol but of course that's the whole reason I decided to go to the store in the first place; and then I put alcohol in my cart. 

Fortunately for me the line at the self-checkout was much slower than usual (half of them were out of service and the worker \[who would've had to check my ID\] was stressed and super busy) and as I waited, an automated alert popped up on my phone from one of my several sobriety apps. When I got to the next place in line I took the alcohol out of my cart, dashed over to the worker's station before I could think about it and put it with the stuff to be restocked and then raced back to my cart to quickly check myself out, alcohol-free. If I hadn't had the ""inconvenience"" of waiting so long I wouldn't have taken the time to assess my actions and would've bought that alcohol. I definitely would've drinken all of that alcohol. And if I didn't have time to finish all that alcohol in secret and had some left over I would've drinken the rest today and bought more because it wouldn't've been enough for one drinking session. 

But... I *didn't* buy it! :) Instead I hit my One Week milestone-- the longest I've been sober in over 3 years.

All night I felt so good about it. I kept thinking about how if I'd gotten drunk earlier in the day I wouldn't be enjoying my evening any more, and in a LOT of ways I'd be enjoying it far less. Today, on Day 8 I don't feel tempted and I am *certain* I'll be sober today too. *And* tomorrow. (I can't promise to myself beyond that; on that particular day I'll have to fight the temptation again, but **if I did it once I can do it again**.)",13

Just came back from the hospital and luckily they didn’t find any ulcers or abnormalities in my system.

Black like coffee grounds and turned into a brighter red color. 
Immediately I knew I fucked up. 
Drinking a fifth a day will catch up to you at some point.

I was recommended to see a GI specialist and seek counseling from an Alcohol Abuse specialist which I surely will do.

Alcohol doesnt do shit for me anymore but take away the anxiety but I can’t keep living like this. 

When Im on a binge, I look like a mess and I don’t see it on the drink. I can’t make improvements to my life while on the drink. It takes me down and hinders me from achieving the success Im seeking in life because Im always drunk.

Today is a new day though and I hope that by writing about my experience will encourage you to put that bottle down and take back control of your lives!

Each little win encourages another little win until you’re like a sober landslide. In the landslide victory sense, not the destructive force of nature sense. Though there’s definitely been some of that for me as well. 

I’ve been taking each day (or hour or minute) as it comes and I’ve reached the point where not drinking finally feels natural, if not good. Better yet, looking at my I Am Sober app, I’ve been able to go longer without checking my number which has meant I’ve started to be surprised with how many days have passed. 

I’m still not perfect, though. Pretty regularly, I get hit with the amazing combinations of brain chemistry and circumstances and feelings that remind me why I drink and life quickly feels like it’s completely unmanageable. That’s when I have been learning to pause, step back, get curious about what’s going on, and if all else fails, go to bed.

Feeling weak today.,"I (23/F) have spent most of the last 3 years drunk- drinking whatever, whenever, and wherever I got the chance. It started out casually, a few shots a day from the bottles my older friends got me, and progressed into me sneaking around to buy and drink liquor constantly without anyone noticing. I was drinking at home, at restaurants, in fitting rooms and bathrooms, even at both school and work, which is just highly dishonorable given my profession. Even when I was clearing half a 1.75L jug of vodka every day, starting as soon as I woke up and going until I crashed that night, I never really got sloppy and it’s usually very easy for me to act sober despite how much I’ve had. 

I had so much anxiety about the inevitable health consequences of what I knew was a serious problem, one that I desperately wanted to stop. Yet, despite strange pains in my liver area, never feeling hungry and always nauseous/puking, losing weight, daily panic attacks, I continued to drink. Around August I noticed that the whites of my eyes were starting to look yellow around the edges. I brushed it off as just being “weird lighting,” yet I would do eye checks every day that sent me spiraling. On November 6th, it all became too much. My eyes were turning deeply yellow and I absolutely freaked out and had a 4 hour panic attack. I showed my boyfriend and he agreed it looked bad, and he took me to the emergency room. He knew as well as anyone that I liked my booze, but he didn’t have the slightest idea how much I was actually drinking. He’d see me crack open a white claw at night and assume it was my first drink of the day, so needless to say he was surprised and scared shitless.

I spent 2 days and 1 night in the hospital, where they ran lots of tests and managed my withdrawal symptoms. They said I have acute alcoholic hepatitis, and that with abstinence I’ll be just fine, but if I continued on like I was then it was going to kill me. That was the wake up call I needed to hear. I don’t want to die. I knew things were very bad but because I didn’t know the exact severity of my condition or health status, I kept pushing my luck. The relief that came with a definite diagnosis was indescribable. No more doctor google, I now know exactly where I stand so there’s no room for my mind to spiral with all the horrible possibilities like it had been for so many months prior. And I know that as long as I take care of myself now, I’ll be fine.

So why am I feeling so weak today??? The last 3 weeks have been a challenge, but I’m already seeing so many positive changes. No more restless sleep and bad dreams, no more daily panic attacks, no more throwing up, and my eyes are looking MUCH better already. I have more energy to focus on what I’m actually doing, rather than figuring out when I can sneak my next swig. (And did I mention solid poops?? 🤤) I know this is good for me and I’m so proud of myself for making it this far, but every atom in my body is screaming for me to go buy a bottle of vodka right now and it’s so frustrating. My mind is telling me “well I’m not on death’s doorstep anymore, it’s the perfect opportunity, nobody would know…” except me. As nice as it sounds to catch a buzz today, I know I can’t use my improving health as an excuse to start drinking again, even a little. BUT HOLY FUCK IT’S HARD. I’m gonna be creeping on this sub a lot today trying to stay strong. It’ll be worth it. I’ve already been through 2 birthday celebrations and a sober thanksgiving, I can’t give up now.

I am not GLAD that I drank but I am glad I had a wake up call. Before my binge I was nearing 2 years sober. But my mental health was in a sorry state. I had way too much anxiety to do basic things. I was too depressed to do anything. And now I’m on medication and can actually do thinks like call around for a therapist and psychiatrist.

I’ve been thinking a lot about the fall out from my actions. Obviously I care about them and will try to make amends as much as possible. With my family, with my husband. But the consequences no longer feel like a sword about to fall on my head. They feel manageable. As in “whatever happens, happens, and I’ll just deal with it.”

Sometimes I will buy myself a coke zero or zero sugar monster, but I messed up and bought a beer. It was just one. 

One too many, Ive been struggling from staying clean since March earlier this year when I swore off drinking. I lost my last job because of drinking, I would show up late or just not show at all. Making excusing and lying to save face and eventually asked not to show at all. I was a huge loser and my poor girlfriend had to endure all this too. She also has struggled with addiction and suddenly my situation became a red flag. She had thoughts of leaving me. To add more to the table, my car broke down on me for the final time so I was car-less too. It was a very difficult time in my life. Coming to terms that alcohol monster that is accepted into our society and that I was an alcoholic.

 I spent 3 months without a car, borrowing my dads car to see my gf or possible jobs. I was broke too so i couldnt buy another car any time soon. I had no call backs for weeks. God must have been on my side because my cousin gives me a call and tells me the company he is working for need a new graveyard mechanic. He said the job is mine but i gotta come in and talk to the yard manager. So I do and I get the job! Graveyard sucks but it is worth it because I ended up saving for my new car after a few months. I was doing better. Plus i could finally afford to pay for dinner.

Although i stopped seeing many of my friends who drink for fun or socially. It was sad to see how many real friends i have. They think im missing out on a good time but i know my history and know better. So i pretty much only spend time with my gf who is infact a diamond and my best friend. She has been so proud of me and cheering me on since then. I have a new car, a fulltime job and im staying clean. 

But i messed up, I drank my first beer in months and it was not worth it. My gf got home from work and smelled it on my breath and i came out clean, I drank a beer and of course she was mad. She told me why i decided to drink and i told her i had no idea what got over me. I still dont. I told her the truth and how sorry i was and it is okay to be mad and upset, that i can leave if she wanted me to. But she said no. We talked about it and she said I thought we were doing better and that this is the last straw and I promised her it would be. I know it was only 1 beer but thats all someone needs to spiral down the staircase of addiction. I know Im better than this. I love her too much too lose what we have over alcohol. I know whats important to me and i cant lose track of it. 

I will be better for me and us.

I'm going on 5 months sober and I have no plans or even thoughts of drinking today. For the first time in a very long time, I actually want to sit with the feelings and attempt to process them. Everyone's been telling me that I shouldn't be putting significance on this day, but for me, knowing that it was coming up meant that I could have ideas for the day so drinking doesn't come up as an option in my head.

I'm currently dating the most amazing person I've ever met, the first healthy relationship I've ever been in. I love her so much, and I have absolutely no desire to leave her, even if my ex came to me today and said she wanted to get together again. It's a different kind of love though. I've pretty much come to terms with the fact that I'll probably never love anyone with the same intensity and passion that I loved my ex - I don't think I'll be able to move ON but I have to move FORWARD.

If you've read this far, thank you, and I guess I'm just looking for some honesty and encouragement (if the encouragement is honest.) Does it get better, in your experiences, or does life just go on and I'll always have to deal with it? Any suggestions for something I could do today to honor the memory that isn't 15-25 toasts of champagne lmao

My biggest bringer of shame was always reaching out to men drunkenly and having pointless, unhealthy, and unsafe one-night stands. 

Yesterday, I was going through my t-shirt drawers getting ready to donate some shirts I don’t wear anymore. I came across one I’d wound up with from a guy I very drunkenly and publicly (in a tent, but surrounded by crowds and their tents) slept with at a music festival over five years ago. The shirt had been signed from members of the band hosting the festival and clearly meant a lot. I’d been drunk the whole weekend, from before we got there Friday evening until we left on Sunday. I fell down in a dress while grooving to one of my favorite bands and embarrassed myself in front of the people I did and didn’t know. I always look back on that weekend with the utmost shame and hatred for myself. 

Every time I came across the shirt in years past, I honestly wanted to burn it, rip it, do something to destroy it, thinking that’d help the feelings associated with that weekend. Yesterday, I (don’t ask me how) remembered this stranger’s name and was able to find him on Instagram. I told him I had something I believed belonged to him and that I wanted to get back to him. 

He quickly responded, admitted he thought he’d never see that shirt again, thanked me for reaching out, and gave me a mailing address. I look forward to getting it back to him. 

There’s a beautiful shift when you’re finally able to address the actions that brought/bring you the most shame associated with your drinking habits. I almost chuckled as I packed the shirt up last night. I’m not abnormal as everyone makes choices they may not be super proud of. We acknowledge, hopefully accept, and learn in the process.

I also suffer from severe health anxiety, so I assumed my extreme drinking was a result from that. During the peak of the pandemic the most I drank was around 15 shots a day.

I still have issues with alcohol, but with the help of my doctor I was able to mostly cut down my drinking, but still suffer from drinking almost every other day. 

With the new strain that's going on, I feel like my anxiety is getting worse and I feel like I'm going to do another binge soon. My doctor doesn't want to prescribe me any anxiety or depression medications because I'm still drinking. Do you have any advice on what I should do?",16

It is 5:32 in the morning. I was having a weird dream. I was with my boyfriend and a couple other people just riding around and having fun on the back roads. The next thing I know, I am stumbling up a set of stairs and I could not remember the night before. But the question was if I had drank or not. My boyfriend also didn't remember. 

As the dream continued I felt guilty and unsure. I was panicking about having to restart my sobriety. I also didn't feel hungover (because it was a dream I guess). Then I woke up. I laid in bed feeling horrible and ashamed, as I often do when I drink. I wondered what the next step should be and how to deal with the immense guilt of drinking again. Then as I was about to get up, it hit me that I was waking up from a dream and had not had anything to drink. This has happened before... I felt immediate relief as well as mildly annoyed and amused at the same time. 

These dreams are terrifying and realistic. I don't have them often but I am going through a lot of changes right now and I feel very stressed. I think that is why I had it. The silver lining is, I did not actually drink. I am here and I am sober. A little over four months as well.

Since quitting drinking I've found exercise and fresh air are my new go to solution for getting the good feels.

Winter weather plus the almost constant cold/flu virus in circulation, and that's hoping you don't catch covid, I'm struggling to stay positive. Also working from home in a tiny cupboard sized office, it gets lonely and boring.

Not really aiming to say anything other than share my self pity and hope for some nuggets of wisdom in the comments. Sunshine forecast for tomorrow so hopefully I'll be able to get out and fill my boots enough to tide me over a few days.

I'm struggling. A few hours from now I can be at the door of my local.  2 minutes walk.  Such would be my normal Saturday morning and afternoon.

I'm not going to!  I **WILL NOT DRINK TODAY!**

So what's my problem?  Boredom, on the face of it.  But really? (I repeat to myself.)

If I go, I will settle down with my first double whiskey and my cigarettes, in the outdoor smoking area. Alone with my thoughts, just as now.  And then I'll simply drink myself into oblivion.

Due to boredom.  Really?

My hands are steady. The nausea and headaches have faded. As I write I am not emotionally distressed. There is no craving.

I'm fed up with video games and tv, the radio, browsing.  They all have their place and time, but surely not all the time!

So, perhaps this is face the music time.  I'm aware that alcohol will kill me - soon, warn some healthcare professionals. So am I thinking of killing myself because I'm bored?

Really?

The phrase '**Killing time**', has just acquired a new meaning for me.

When did I lose the joy of life - the sheer joy of just being alive? Was it ever there?  Was it taken from me because of my alcohol abuse?  If so, can it be returned?  Can I get it back?

Perhaps this is the real question that I need addressed.

I think I will search for an answer.

2021-11-27 02:44:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r38j2q/the_vicuous_cycle/,The vicuous cycle,"So, I've been unemployed for nearly 3 full months now, other than working a job for 2 days recently. During this time I've been drinking 3-6 times a week, sometimes up to 5 days in a row, with a few days off here and there, and also was sober for a week recently. Overall since the pandemic began in early 2020, my drinking has drastically increased. I've known I was an alcholic for at least 5 years, but I drank infrequently and didn't have too many consequences. Now my typical day consists of drinking usually starting in the early afternoon and drinking for usually 5-6 hours, then passing out. Extremely depressing and unproductive. 

I know having a job would help a lot, as I live alone and just have way too much time on my hands. I have an interview on Monday. A lot of the reason I haven't gotten a job since quitting my last one 3 months ago, is due to alcohol. My anxiety is so high (mostly alcohol related), that I feel incapable. I also have life circumstances (behind on rent, car problems), that make me want to escape, and alcohol seems to be the easiest way to ignore my problems. I guess I just am wondering if anybody has any advice on how to get through the next 2 days specifically without drinking. On the days I don't drink I usually do some intense cardio but other than that I don't feel I really do anything beneficial for myself.

I just want to end this vicious cycle of drinking, guilt/shame, drinking. I used to get very bad hangovers up until the last year or so and that prevented me from drinking as much as I do now. Now I very rarely get hangovers or sick from alcohol. I definitely feel better waking up the next day sober, but overall it doesn't deter me from drinking like it used to. Alcohol has caused me to lie so much to my family and friends. Other than 2 friends nobody else even knows I drink at all. I'm only 25, but I know the longer I drink, the harder it will be to stop. Luckily, I haven't ever had to deal with any withdrawals other than not being able to sleep, but I know if I continue to drink I will start becoming physically dependent. I also have noticed my tolerance has soared. I used to be content with a 6 pack of 5% beer or seltzers, and now I drink  7-8, 8% seltzers regularly. I appreciate any advice or any insight anyone has. Sorry this was long. I will not drink with you today.",5

I spent 2 days hallucinating after they were purged from my system and beyond hope that I'd escape in the hospital. Brutal shit. Had my family and friends in a place that no one should be. Spent 2 more days in the psych ward and discharged today. Started antabuse (I know how crazy it is and I know that there is NO ALCOHOL consumption or it could be deadly including mouth wash, deodorant, etc). But this is my start, I need the help and the crutch because I've tried myself and haven't succeeded. Which I used to think was weakness but I don't believe that shit now. We have brains that are wired in whatever way and trauma and stories, we are not weak. But I know now that I want my old self back and I want to heal so I'm trying it.

I am also ready to accompany antabuse with the other hard work, which I believe is absolutely necessary in the equation.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 ""We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.” – Dorothy Day

“Heroes didn’t leap tall buildings or stop bullets with an outstretched hand; they didn’t wear boots and capes. They bled, and they bruised, and their superpowers were as simple as listening, or loving. Heroes were ordinary people who knew that even if their own lives were impossibly knotted, they could untangle someone else’s. And maybe that one act could lead someone to rescue you right back.” – Jodi Picoult

Good morning and happy Saturday my fellow Sobernauts!  It has been an incredible week, and I have so enjoyed spending it with you. For my final DCI, it only seems appropriate to reflect upon the importance and power of community. 

Many years ago now, I saw a video that made a really big impression on me. It was video footage taken inside a jail. A guard had suffered a heart attack and fallen outside of the cells. The inmates were trying to break out of their cells. Not to escape. They were trying to get out so that they could help the fallen guard. 

One of the things that spoke to me about that moment was the proof of our shared humanity. No matter what sides we fall on (in this case, what sides of  literal bars we fall on) we have it in us to care for and fight for each other. No matter how ""bad"" some of us think we are (or society tells us we are) we retain that desire and ability to help our fellow humans in need. We maintain a sense of community. 

And when I think about it, I think that maybe that video I saw spoke to me so loudly because it was such a pure distillation of one of the major lessons I think we can take from this life. Namely that we should all of us be trying to break out of these cells that we put ourselves or find ourselves in, so that we can help each other mend our broken hearts. 

Much love to all of you in this incredible community. Thank you again for a wonderful week.

I had a bunch of fits and starts getting here. It's been much easier and much harder than I thought it'd be. Honestly, SD helped get me going. Read my profile history for why I even registered for a reddit account. It was because of this group.

I do not think I could have done this on my own. I've had a support structure that's helped keep me accountable. One person in particular has been my sobriety coach and my best friend. She gives me gum and we have coffee and there's meaning she's created behind it that helps. She's been pissed at me and loving to me and kind and hard and a royal pain in my ass and so, so encouraging and most of all an inspiration to make me want to be better and do better. I couldn't have done it without her. 

My family and close friends are now also fully on board and supportive and have become my reason to want to keep going.

I don't know if I'll be fully successful and never drink again or not, but I now know I can do this and I don't need to drink to live or live to drink.

There are still moments that are hard as hell. There are others that make this feel easy. One day at a time helps. IWNDWYT helps, a lot more than i ever thought it would. This subreddit helps a ton. You people get me, and I don't even know most of you. I also know you all intimately. I've conversed with a few of you and read your posts and celebrated and cried with you. Thank you all.

Mostly what I've learned is that to do this, you have to want it. If you don't want it, it won't work. Once you decide you want it, do it. Don't let failure stop you from keeping trying. Keep coming back here. This is the best group on reddit. 

If you want it, it'll stick. I want it to stick. I like me more now.

I’ll just dive right in - I was drinking about 20 drinks a night 6 nights a week as a terribly depressed bartender in a tourist town for about 10 years. I slowed down to bingeing 2/3 nights a week after getting a desk job in a new city. So, basically, I’ve been a heavy drinker for about 15 years. I check on my liver via blood test about once a year and I’ve have an ultrasound - everything came back fine. Also, I’ve never experienced withdrawals (I’ve taken weeks/a month off). 

So just recently my hands and feet have started to itch terribly at night. I googled it and it said it could be a liver issue. Has anyone else experienced this? Also, I’m very interested in quitting, but I’ve convinced myself that alcohol is the only thing that relaxes me. :( I have severe depression, OCD, PTSD and GAD and I don’t respond to medication. It’s been a tough go, but like I said, I think I’m ready to quit. Help please. ♥️",6

I didn't even fully realize it was gonna be my first sobriety date but I quickly realized how screwed I was and got help immediately.

I am in a better place now and know how to ride out cravings like tonight.

There is some drama going on with my family and my sister's new dog. He has some aggression issues because he is afraid. I've seen him go from the wagging his tail to snapping one second later. It's been 4 months and while there is some improvement, things are still not getting much better. He didn't break the skin but he did end up biting my Mom and we both feel wary with him.

It's stirring up a lot of unpleasantness because my father abused me and I would use anger to cover up my fear of him (before I found alcohol quieted the fear so well). It just sucks because I don't see it working out with this dog and it's not his fault. Although the shelter didn't say, he has had to come from an abusive background to be so scared that he reacts in anger and I understand how that feels.

It's not even my dog and not my decision to keep him or not but even the idea of ""giving up"" and rehoming him just makes me think what if someone gave up on me through my own struggle with anger and PTSD and it's a craving inducing thought.

I am in my PJs and drinking seltzer water with no plans to go out and get alcohol but damn, this situation just really sucks and it being packed onto such an important day in my sobriety just made it the perfect storm for cravings tonight.

Someone on this sub mentioned that in a way, they missed the day after drinking- the slowing down, the laziness, the snacking, the canceling plans to just give your body and brain a break. So they planned a dry hangover day if I remember correctly. I loved the idea and had to try it.

I own a bakery, and thanksgiving is our single biggest sales day all year. I was working 12-14 hours days this week, and we KILLED IT Wednesday. We sold so many breads, rolls, pies, cookies, you name it. Biggest success since I opened the bakery. I was running on caffeine, very little sleep, and adrenaline the whole week.

Took yesterday off to travel 4 hours one way to see family, so as you can imagine that wasn’t super relaxing. Fun, but certainly not relaxing 😂

I scheduled myself off today (minus a trip to the grocery for the bakery, I am a small business owner after all lol) and I’ve been doing exactly the following:
-slept in until 730
-drank coffee
-ate egg rolls and dumplings 
-scrolled tiktok 
-watched two Harry Potter movies with my 4 year old
-took a 2 hour nap
-watched more Harry Potter
-ate cosmic brownies and Doritos

And my evening will consist of more of that. I did not (and will not)
-clean any part of the house
-wash dishes
-practice yoga
-care about what I’m eating today
-change out of my pajamas
-feel guilty about any of this

Hope y’all are giving yourself grace and space to do what makes you feel good. 

I will not drink with y’all today 💜",67

I've done many substances but alcohol was one I couldn't understand - I didn't see how people could ever do it habitually. Lately, I've been looking at my habit with alcohol, and realized that it's truly insidious, because I couldn't see the damage it was causing my life.

I'd justify the habit, saying stupid things like ""you've had a rough time in life - it's normal to drink!"", ""you're really fit, it's fine to have some drink to unwind, you deserve it!"", ""look at how many great poets, philosophers, and writers drank - this is normal!"". But now - the reality has hit me in the face like a flying brick.

What I'm doing is not normal. It's said that ""heavy drinking""/being an alcoholic is having 14 drinks per week - I was flabbergasted at that number. 14 drinks per week... that's not even close to what I've been doing - more like 54 per week.

Tomorrow is a new day - I hope to be a part of this community. I'm writing this for reference in the future, and to vent my frustration at the abuse I've caused myself. Luckily I put my pain onto myself and not others - though I guess, when you're hurting, the ones you love still get hurt via proxy.

The darkness that entered, when I used to drink, is truly the definition of an abyss - it's truly amazing that I'm alive.

Then lock down happened here in New Zealand and the days became tedious so I decided hey what would happen if i just got a dozen beers and pack of ciggies. 1 month later I cant go a week without blacking out. This morning my girlfriend asked me to leave and stay with my parents and ""she can't deal with my shit anymore"", looks like I finally pushed her too far.

I have no one to talk to about this, my parents and some friends know I drink too much but don't understand why I cant just stop completely.

Well today my daughter slept until almost noon and then started in on me about not buying her new gym shoes on Wednesday, as soon as she woke up.

Yeah, ok.  Whatever.  Told her to make her bed Tuesday.  She still hadn’t made it.  Then she called her mom and her mom started in on me.  

Reminded them that I’ve been waiting for her to make her bed since Tuesday.

So she made her bed.  And we went and got her some shoes.  

It’s very difficult for me to set boundaries… well that’s not exactly true.  It’s difficult for me to uphold boundaries!  Especially with my 10 year old daughter.

Like damnit kid, takes you 3 mins to make your bed and it’s been 3 days!  

She’s very stubborn.  It’s impressive.  She refuses to clean her room.   I decided that at some point, her room would get too messy for her to tolerate.  My goal was to find that point, at what point would she decide, like hey this is fucking disgusting, maybe I should clean up?

Well, I failed.  The odor coming out of her room was wafting into the rest of the house, even with her door closed.

I caved and cleaned her room.

So now we try again, and if I fail again, I will fail better.

Although this is a true story, it’s supposed to be a metaphor about alcohol addiction but I think I lost it somewhere.

Anyways, since 2020, I’ve become a nocturnal hermit and going to a retail store on Black Friday was not fun.  


Tonight, I will be drinking tea and eating some ice cream and reading some order of the Phoenix with my daughter.  That’s the plan, we’ll see what happens!!

This is my first holiday season sober and I felt surprisingly very self conscious bringing Martinelli's instead of wine. I was so worried about what my family was thinking or would say, but everyone was so kind and understanding. Half the table drank it with me before they had a single glass of wine. I know it seems super silly to be so excited about other people drinking my Martinelli's at dinner instead of wine, but it made me feel so comfortable and so completely welcome there. My aunt even asked me how my sobriety was going and commended me for working so hard at it, and encouraged me to keep going. It made me glow and feel so loved.

I did accidentally have a sip of my cousin's wine, which was the same color as my Martinelli's and was right next to my glass. It was so nasty! I cannot believe I used to like the taste of wine, all I could taste was the alcohol, and I didn't enjoy it at all. I will forever be bringing the Martinelli's to all family functions for the rest of my life.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.” - Teddy Roosevelt.

In terms of sobriety, I think this quote exemplifies it’s about the battle not the outcome. So as long as you keep trying to fight the good fight and get sober it doesn’t matter how many times you fail, all that matters is that you tried. So for everyone that slipped up yesterday, don’t worry about it, dust yourself off and get back at it. For those who stuck with it, keep with it. Just don’t allow yourself to live a life wondering about what could have been if you would have tried to be sober. All you can do is try. IWNDWYT.",14

That taught me a lot in 10 minutes before I worked out how to delete it ! Haven’t felt as anxious since er… I drank 5 weeks ago.

Anyway my little story was that I went out for dinner and without asking waiter brought two glasses of Prosecco. I expect they keep a log at the place. I turned one away and ordered a soft drink. 

I did then try a zero red wine with my main course. I get that some people don’t like these - I can empathise with that. I found it helpful. 

It was probably the first time we have been out for a posh dinner where I felt comfortable not drinking. I sometimes think “what’s the point” as I associate restaurants with wine and food. It’s a huge blocker for me in my head on ever stopping for good. I guess I must have missed it more that I would admit to myself as doh ! I ordered a zero wine. 

But for today that’s another day down and that’s what I set out today to achieve - not to solve the Existential issues around whether as an alcoholic I can fully  enjoy a meal out sober. The chicken was good - the king crab salad. I admit that I missed the wine that came with it. But not enough to order one and won’t miss the hangover as it would have been a bottle when I got home and an excuse to stay up to watch a film etc etc. That’s all have to say about that as Forest Gump would say.

I need this to click before I screw everything up and destroy my life. Not to brag, but things are going great. I got a bigger than expected raise at work and am on the fast track to move up the ladder in the company. I enjoy my job and respect the company I work for and am constantly receiving praise and gratitude from my bosses.  My depression meds are working like magic and the family life has been very nice.  The ONLY thing in my life right now that puts all of this in jeopardy is the booze. 

I have zero control over my drinking, haven't for about the last 14 years if I'm being honest with myself.  Without it I know every aspect of my life will improve. The only negative of giving it up is that I won't have it anymore. So, why is it that having 15+ beers every night of the week is more important to me than being truly happy in life? I could probably work towards getting off the meds and finally feeling ""normal"".

It feels like sometimes that’s all I do here, but it helps to get it out & try to take away some of the weight of these thoughts. 

I got dumped on Monday and yes, it has everything to do with my behavior when drunk over the last few months. It hurts so much because I know he had every right to walk away, but also because after he went through a really dark time, I was there for him every step of the way. Never once during his struggles in 2019-20 did I ever consider walking away. Granted, we were just friends then & only texting/talking on the phone. So I didn’t have to put myself through the same experience he went through with me these last few months. But, it just feels like a slap in the face. I stood by him during many drunken rants, suicide threats & very dark/angry conversations. The difference is, he never aimed that anger at me. 

I’m also especially upset because he knows the kind of person I am 99% of the time & she looks/acts nothing like I do when I’m in the throes of a binge. But, he says the drunk me is too much to deal with & it’s not worth the verbal abuse he takes - even if it is only once a month. My drunk behavior is just too much to forgive. He’s given me too many chances already & this last outburst was the “last outburst.”  He’s done.

What hurts, maybe the most, is the timing of it all. He dumped me three days before Thanksgiving, knowing how my ex made my holidays hell - year after miserable year - leaving me various times on Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve, Easter, Independence Day. He promised me so much for the coming weeks.  We made all kinds of plans for December & Christmas & basically he’s doing to me exactly what my ex did. I can’t believe I have to go through another holiday season alone. 

I’m left wondering if I did this all on purpose. Self-sabotage is a huge problem for me & I’m so angry because I just can’t allow myself to be happy. I KNOW it’s MY FAULT for giving into the alcohol cravings & running to wine when I feel challenged or overwhelmed. He didn’t owe me anything & I am grateful for the time he gave me. He is going to make someone a wonderful partner & I can’t believe I didn’t appreciate him enough to get help for my addiction before I lost him. My life feels so empty right now & I know that loneliness is exactly what I deserve. I hope this feeling never leaves me because maybe it took a loss like this to take responsibility for this problem & acknowledge that my drinking problem is mine alone to address. 

TL;DR - Dumped & alone for the holidays. I know it’s all my fault for being awful/verbally abusive when drunk & waiting until after he left me to get professional help for my addiction. Just feeling frustrated with myself for putting myself in this position.

So normally holidays and friend/family gatherings are a blast and kind of a non-stop party and feel goods. Normally, I am half in the bag most of the time. 

Navigating these social terrains sober was kind of...boring. And I'm learning that's okay. I've used alcohol to manufacture a good time for years now. Dont like the movie my friend puts on? Nothing a bottle of wine wont cure. 
Conversation getting tedious? Shots!! Dinner with awkward relatives? Load me up, I'll learn their whole past and be very* interested. 

Being sober this holiday illuminated how intolerant to boredom I've become. Chasing highs and suppressing lows does that to you I guess. I was particularly tempted last night because we met up with old high school friends while our parents went to bed. We gathered and played board games and without alcohol, I figured it would just be bored games. The temptation to just pull over and get some wine or champagne was pretty huge. But I didn't! But I really wanted to. 

And once I fought through the initial grumpiness and the resentment that I can never be someone who casually drinks during social gatherings, I had some pretty profound revelations. There were moments of awkward silences, times jokes didnt land, minutes of story telling that felt tedious and forced, annoyance at the way someone was playing the game. There were also moments I was laughing so hard I cried, tenderness, joy from making evil moves against my friends in the game, and a crush even started to form without the aid of the buzz of wine that usually informs my crushes lol. 

There were moments that sucked this weekend, but the moments that were awesome were even more awesome than drunk awesome because the awesome was earned and real. Everything was authentic. It's weird to be learning how to live life unfiltered again, because I'm sitting here overanalyzing a simple night with friends. 

But I'm so thankful to be on this path, and I know (hope) I'm not the only one who was so deep into the drinking that normal circumstances feel foreign and strange lol. 

Happy holidays friends.",42

I still have plenty of crap to deal with that I don't really want to deal with. But it feels so good to be sober again. I'm starting to feel like me again, I'm starting to feel centered in myself and remember, ""Oh yeah, *this* is who I actually am. And I actually *like* myself.""

The only family I have in the area is out of town right now, and I ended up spending most of my Thanksgiving hanging around Alano clubs with AA people. I went to one club for a meal which was terrific, relaxing, and really great. Spent a lot of time talking with a friend who's fairly new in AA and it turned out that, even though we grew up in very different locations, we'd actually spent our teen years listening to many of the same fairly obscure bands, and it was a lot of fun shooting the shit about that.

Later on in the evening I went to some AA meetings at a different club, and it was interesting how conversation flowed between chatting before and after the meetings and sharing in the meetings. Some of the people I already knew and some of them I'd recently met and some of them were people who I'd never talked to before, but because we were sharing honestly in the meetings about where we were at in our sobriety, it felt very natural and easy to talk in a real way in between meetings. 

I got incredibly isolated this year. Isolating is a lifelong defense mechanism for me, when I'm under stress I tend to shut down and go down into my shell. As the pandemic has dragged on that hasn't helped, and as the crap I was dealing with compounded I shut down and couldn't find my way out. It was really scary, I got into a really dark place, and when I finally relapsed it wasn't like I thought that drinking was going to work for me again, I was sorta just trying to do *anything* to break out of it.

As I'm finding my feet again in sobriety and getting back into AA I've started praying again. I grew up in a stridently religious household and I **definitely** am not religious by any stretch of the imagination. But in my recovery journey I've come to appreciate that spirituality is not the same thing as religion, and I can have my own spiritual practices and beliefs without subscribing to any sort of ideology. And I've just had experiences which lead me to believe that there are forces at work in the universe which are beyond my understanding. In AA literature it talks about the God of our understanding, but for me, it's the Higher Power of my own experience. I'm still a cynical and distrustful alcoholic, I only believe in my HP because I have some pretty concrete evidence in my life that has shown me that there are forces at work in the universe which are both real and not something that I can explain away.

Anyway, I've been extremely lonely lately. Which, I mean, is an inevitable byproduct of spending so much time in near total isolation. I am still a human being, even though I sometimes pretend that I'm a robot who doesn't need anyone or anything. I started praying to not be lonely. With the added disclaimer that I fully understand that such prayers are probably not going to be answered the way that I would like them to be. I've learned to be a little careful in what I pray for, because in my experience prayers do get answered, it's just not usually in the way I want or expect.

But as I was driving home last night I realized that my prayers had been answered in a really lovely, joyful way. I ended up hanging out in a late night restaurant with a different group of people from AA the night before Thanksgiving, so I've had a couple of days of socializing with people in recovery in really fun and meaningful ways. It has been really healing. 

I'm so grateful for the kindness and love and acceptance that I've found from other people in recovery, both on here and in AA. It is something that I really needed, and I don't think that I've ever really had anything like it in my life before. I don't really have those kinds of relationships or that kind of support from my family of origin, and while I've had romantic relationships and close friendships over the years, I've never really experienced this kind of kindness and love and acceptance from a community. Which makes it so much more precious to me. I'm extremely grateful that I'm an alcoholic because it gives me the opportunity to experience this and be a part of something that is so positive for me.

I'm grateful to be here and I'm grateful for my sobriety. Much love to my sobernaut family.

This is my first time posting in this subreddit, and I am extremely grateful to learn that this community exists. I am currently celebrating 103 days of sobriety, but weirdly feel like it gets harder the more time that passes? Healthy coping mechanisms are difficult! Every time I’m feeling super stressed/sad/anxious my natural inclination is to reach for the bottle and numb out. After spending so much of my life in a state of relative anhedonia it feels...frightening to be experiencing a full range of emotions again. My roommate calls it “thawing in my humanness”, which I find to be such a beautiful (if not terrifying) sentiment. 

It’s incredibly paradoxical, to be feeling this way. On the one hand, I’m incredibly grateful to be living mindfully and in the present moment, to be taking inventory of my most authentic self, of my innermost desires and emotional nuances. At the same time, I truly am grieving the loss of my drunk self, who in many ways felt so much happier, more likable, more connected, and more carefree than my sober self. What I do know is that I do not drink like a normal person and that those feelings were mostly illusionary; I have an incredibly toxic relationship with alcohol defined by bruises and blackouts and near deaths. I know I want better for myself and am committed to my sobriety over anything else. 

The last time I seriously attempted a period of sobriety was in 2019...I made it to 6 month only for 182 days of commitment and hard work to dissipate in an instant. It was an incredibly frustrating feeling, and it took me two years to be honest with myself again. I hope one day I can make sober friends, and work towards cultivating a sober community, so that maybe this journey will feel a bit less lonely and isolating. Anyways, I am grateful to be here, and thank you for reading😊",53

No big deal…until I wake up this morning and realize I lost 3600 bucks last night.  Sober me would never do something like that.  Just dumb fucking decisions, and my family deserves better of me.  I deserve better of myself.  I don’t drink every day, and I think for a long time, because of that, I’ve always assumed I’m in control.

In the past 2.5 years I’ve only had two sober streaks- one was 6 weeks (felt incredible) and one was 18 days this past August (also felt incredible- had the energy of a little kid again, it was fantastic). 

When I did my first sober streak, I had only been drinking problematically for about 6 months. And I wasn’t drinking even half of what I have been the past year. Last winter/spring I was usually having anywhere from 7 to 10 drinks a day, and I’m a small female. 

I’m glad I’m not regularly drinking that amount anymore, but I think it’s creeping back up there. Had 4 beers and 3 shots of vodka last night, alone in my room. Currently typing this hungover as fuck, frustrated that I’ve already ruined my day off, which I had planned on using to be productive.

I think my issue is that quitting alcohol has never been for ME, it’s been for other people, so it never lasted. But I’ve been wanting to do it for myself for so long, I just haven’t made it more than 48 hours sober. I’ve already quit adderall, and I quit vaping nicotine 8 days ago (which I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy, btw) so I know I can quit alcohol too. But the shame cycle keeps me locked in, it seems. I’m so disgusted with myself.

That’s how I always coped with feeling uncomfortable in my skin on holidays. The drinking after the family part to wash it all away was crucial. I couldn’t do it yesterday and I really missed it. Instead I just had to sit with my tension and anxiety, even after the family stuff was over. I wish there was another way to turn it off. 

I should mention that my family’s actually pretty great and nice to me, and I have a lot to be thankful for. I just hate being me sometimes. Anyway, still sober.",37

I’ve been a daily drinker (10+ drinks a day) for a little over 3 years and have gone through the whole rollercoaster of attempting to stop. Every so often I’ll ‘quit’ and make it to about 10 days without alcohol, then I’ll relapse and the cycle starts over again where I’ll drink everyday for a few months before another small 10 day break where I tell myself i will not pick up the bottle or grab a 6 pack on the way home. Well… we all know how that goes and the cycle continues. 

This year I started getting these weird symptoms in my legs and feet: pretty constant muscle twitching, pins and needles, random burning sensations, and recently a weird sensation of cold water being on my skin. I’ve gotten blood tests for everything and don’t seem to have deficiencies but from what I have gather, this could be alcoholic neuropathy developing? Has anyone else experienced neuropathy symptoms in the form of cold water sensations? It feels like random cold patches sort of being sprinkled on various spots on my legs.

I don't remember any of it but the stories of my behavior are quite the tale to tell.

I apologized profusely to said coworker, apologized profusely my child, to the other coworkers present, to the owners of the establishment, and proclaimed to all that I was taking it as a sign that I need to reevaluate my life and I was quitting drinking.

I tried and failed at that, but lied and told everybody that I quit.  The class-clown variety coworkers have tried to get me to come out again, the target of my lavicious commentary has tried to get me to come back out (said person's spouse was in attendance that night and found the whole escapade hilarious)...but I said Nope.  I had quit drinking, I'm good thanks.

This was all months ago.  The jokes have died and life returned to normal.  The suggestions to come out have died off.  Everyone thinks I've been cut and dry sober since that day.  So here I am, on day 8 of *actually* being sober and to all the world, its old news and and its a day like any other.

I'm just saying to those lurkers who are planning on quitting drinking 'sooner or later', maybe just bullshit people that you did.  Get all the reactions out of the way, and just slip into it quiet-like when you're ready without the fuss from your ex-drinking-buddies.

I actually have two days off for Thanksgiving for once (I've worked retail most of my life and pretty much never had holidays off). Woke up after sleeping in (sober) this morning and realized I don't have anything I ""need"" to do other than dishes from yesterday, which I already rinsed so they won't be bad at all.

I'd dreamed about my hometown and something about that, maybe, is making me feel like when I was a kid and had a day off from school. Not looking forward to drinking, just looking forward to relaxing and eating leftovers and playing video games. The warm, fuzzy, expectation of contentment for a day that I haven't felt in years. (My childhood was not perfect, fwiw, but there were def good days.)

It's partly luck, I could easily have woken up bored with nothing planned for today - I'm that kind of person sometimes and I don't want anyone to think this post means I'm magically cured of craving alcohol. It's just really nice to have this feeling for once and I know I wouldn't be feeling this way at all if I was still drinking. I'd be launched into it already and probably wondering if I was going to need to go to the store because I'd drank through whatever I'd bought to stock up for my days off. Guilt, shame, anxiety, and drinking even more to try to make it go away.

I want to thank everyone on this sub, while I'm at it. I've leaned on this heavily since quitting and I know every one of you from Day Zero to Day How Is That Possible? have helped bring me to the point where I can have this moment of peace, even if it's just for one day or one hour. It's a gift I wasn't expecting. IWNDWYT!",17
2021-11-26 11:41:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2rd6k/conflicted_about_next_steps/,Conflicted about next steps,"I just want to share my thoughts with you all.

I'm 27 and I have been drinking considerable amounts of alcohol ever since I've met my fiancee (5 years ago).

I slowly ramped up from drinking only on the weekends to drinking \~4 times a week (1 day breaks inbetween). I usually drink white wine with my fiancee, we ramped up to downing a bottle (750ml) each. We don't drink other alcohol.e Sometimes (once every 2 weeks) we do a third bottle too, usually on Fridays. We start drinking during dinner after we finish working and just chill, play games and watch movies to pass time. (it takes us 4 hours to finish the 2 bottles)

Today it hit me that we've been maybe overdoing it, it hit my fiancee the same. We talked about this all day and it's not our first discussion about this issue. We've talked about us possibly being alcoholics many times when hangover. However, we went a whole month sober this year when she was on antibiotics (I don't like drinking alone so I just didn't too) and we generally skip drinking when we have activities planned (like hiking, rock climbing etc). I also dump unfinished bottles down the drain after parties etc.

We're not slobs, we're quite healthy (according to the bloodwork and physicals) and fit.

The amount we drink is starting to feel scary to us though. We want to cut down, but to be honest we had this discussion many times and we never did cut it down. Would quitting cold turkey be better for us? I feel like we're getting lazy and skip healthy activities more and more. On the other side we love wine and we love drinking with our friends. We have a huge meet-up with out college friends tomorrow and there will be booze, fun and dancing. We also like having a drink after a long day of mountain climbing etc, it just feels right.

Cutting back doesn't work, we're slowly ramping up the amount we drink... I don't like where this is going, but I don't want to .. stop drinking completely? I want to drink with my friends and in warranted social situations or have that candle lit romantic dinner with my fiancee. Have any of you cut down successfully? Do you have any tips? How can we make ourselves accountable and quit drinking on the weekdays at least?",5

I should be proud of this but I’m not. Who needs others to tear you down when you will do it for the universe, right? 

I live in a pajama prison. Because of COVID it gave an excuse for me to withdraw even more. 

When I quit drinking I thought it would be this magical option that would change my life in a ways I couldn’t imagine. It did.  It did in the opposite way. Instead of drowning my sorrows and nightmares with booze I now have to face them. 

After 90 days it was clear that I wasn’t going to be able to do this alone. So I started up therapy. They tried out a couple medications to help with PTSD and MDD but the side effects of the drugs were worse than the original disease. I went into a huge mental spiral after starting Sertaline and Gabapentin proved to make my nightmares worse not better. So I’m back to smoking cannabis before bed. I don’t want to feel combative with my psychiatrist and psychologist about medications but I don’t have the luxury of test driving medications for weeks at a time while also working full time to pay my bills, and also while wanting to relocate the top of my head with a .357 round. 

I can’t concentrate at work. All I can think about is how everything hurts physically and mentally. I never get answers or when I get close it seems like a new tumor is found or some other rare disease. But burn pits don’t cause health problems huh?????

I wasn’t even that bad of a drinker. I rarely called in because of hangovers. Most of the time it was my depression that would warrant that. By the end of it though I was getting drunk every day. Functional alcoholic is the term I suppose? 

No I really was that bad of a drinker. I drank to forget. That’s about the worst reason to use to drink. Especially when you sit at home and do it all by your lonesome. 

This thanksgiving I holed up and played some video games and watched movies with spurts if sobbing. 

I just want to be normal again. I just want to smile, laugh and love again. But I’ll never be who I was. That life has long past. Now I’m stuck with an empty shell that’s been used and abused by a system that doesn’t care. 

I didn’t even talk to anyone this year or message happy thanksgiving because I’m just not thankful or grateful. I didn’t want to spread my misery. 

I took the easy route in life and now I get to pay for it with my health and sanity. 

At least for now, I have my Dog. He always cares.

137 days sober from alcohol. I wish I would wake up from this nightmare. Thanks for reading.",19

They give unsolicited advice and have been going off the rails recently, which is causing me a lot of mental distress to watch.

Two weeks ago they (V) asked me to check up on their sponcee (A). I wasn’t overly comfortable as I’ve only met the girl once but I knew they were struggling. As things grew worse with my friends mental state, they themselves have stopped communicating with their sponcee (A). Now this girl (only 19) has been relying heavily on me and my other friend, S, has also had to help out as this girl is very young and in a lot of pain. S is their TA at university. So it’s all very messy and we only got involved because V asked us to, and they’re our friend.

This week the girl relapsed and threatened suicide. We helped her out as best we could, even though I barely know her and don’t even know her address to send help. V took little action, saying they couldn’t go to her because of work and that we should take a step back and not get so involved. After asking us to get more involved a week later. They (V) just told me not to go to her and said that the girl was just a junkie desperate for attention.

I’m very hurt by the abuse of my need to help people, which comes from trauma with my mum, which V knows about. And the to be given unsolicited condescending advice after just trying to help out in a situation I was asked to help out in. I feel very disrespected and manipulated by this person I thought loved me and saw as one of my best friends, especially as they are a big part of my journey in sobriety.",8
2021-11-26 11:21:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2qy1b/huge_trigger_headed_my_way/,Huge Trigger Headed My Way,"Hey SD! Looking for a little support/advice over something that is worrying me. My uncle died on Wednesday. I honestly barely knew him, so it's sad, but I'm not really personally grieving, if that makes sense. That's not the trigger. My parents have asked me to come house sit and take care of their pets while they are out of state for the funeral. I have talked to my husband and he is going to take over the practical things that I usually do like picking the kids up from school and getting them to their activities so I can house sit for my parents for 4 days. So that's that. 

I think it was already lurking in the back of my mind that being alone and pretty close to responsibility free means that I could drink as much as I wanted ""just for those 4 days"" but it got even more brutal when my mom, trying to be helpful and grateful for my help, was asking me what she could stock the kitchen with for me to eat and asked ""and I know you're not really a big drinker anymore but would you like me to get a bottle of wine for you to treat yourself with?"" Aaaaaaaaargh.

So freaking tempted.

But no. I played the tape forward and thought about what it would feel like to wake up (most likely in a sitting position on their uncomfortable as hell couch in my clothes) feeling hungover and sick as I almost certainly would, and it made me feel sick to my stomach just thinking about it.

So I said no, please stock the house with alllll the Diet Dr. Pepper because that's my jam these days.

But I'm still steeling myself for the temptation to nip out and get a bottle while I'm there. I'm probably going to be posting here constantly during those 4 days, so look forward to getting spammed from me and YOU'RE WELCOME. 😂

The last two years have been very tough. I gave up on my dream career for the sake of my family, lost my dad, have been very lonely after moving states, covid restrictions, etc.  I’ve struggled off and on with drinking (mostly on). Tried quitting a couple times, longest I made it was a month. My wife thinks I haven’t been drinking for awhile (after a fight and an ultimatum), but I’ve gotten very good at sneaking. But it’s enough. I need to come to grips with the fact that I’m addicted, and I really don’t want to be. Though even in saying that part of me insists that I’m not and that drinking in moderation is something I can do and is a very good thing I shouldn’t give up on…After all this time and so many failed attempts to quit or moderate, I still feel torn. I want today to be the day I can commit. Wish me luck.

EDIT: The end was a bit unclear, perhaps.  Although I would love to drink in moderation, and do feel like I'm losing something good, I've shown myself over and over the past few years that I simply can't.  I'm committing today to not drink at all",153

It seems counter intuitive but for me it seems to help. I think it’s because on the one hand it gives you the “thrill” of drinking without actually doing it, and also can remind you of the perils of alcoholism….again, without actually drinking. 

I could totally see why someone might avoid drinking songs for the temptation or urges they might trigger, but for any of you who feel like me I thought I’d share one of my favorites on this fine Friday.

I found a can of one of my favorite hard ciders. For years I knew exactly how much alcohol was in our house and where (sometimes hidden in places where other people wouldn't find it)... and somehow, this can of hard cider went completely unnoticed for nearly 11 months. I felt proud when I found it... it seemed significant. Even better than not remembering it, I didn't even want it.

My husband drank it with dinner. I found a bottle of seltzer for us to empty so we could make a rocket. It was a great day.

When I was drinking, I had a short fuse, I was inwardly intolerant and wildly judgemental of others. I knew very little peace. I'm still nowhere near perfect, and every day, little struggles try to push me back to the bottle. But by staying sober, I'm better able to stop, take a minute, and reach out to my higher power, or a trusted friend, for help with my thinking. I look at my own thinking and try to get it more in line with who I want to be, instead of who I was. I'm starting to feel real serenity that booze, drugs, or prideful accomplishment could never give me. Satisfaction with the fact that I will do, or have done, the best I can today, and that I will do my best to do better tomorrow is so alien of a feeling to me. I couldn't be more grateful for this new and profound feeling. IWNDWYT",8

We don't have that here in the UK but what I am dreading is Christmas time. 

All my friends want to have dinners and evenings out, work Christmas party, family celebrations. All heavily revolve around drinking.

Trying to get sober I've had a lot of fear of missing out (Fomo) and fear of losing people. But I am slowly starting to realise all I'm missing out on is making a fool of myself, feeling like crap hungover and the anxiety and shame that comes with it. 

I've lost myself for years due to this disease and I am slowly starting to heal. I've tried getting sober since September. I've lapsed, I beat myself up about it, I've felt shame on being weak. 

But gosh darn respect to those who've stuck at it.  I'm slowly starting not to treat this as a task to complete or a goal to meet and just say I'm sober today. I'm starting to like sober me again. I may be in another honeymoon period. But I've learned my Fomo is unwarranted I can do things sober and if people start to get drunk just leave they won't notice after a few more drinks. 

Got into an old hobby of mine minitaure wargaming (aos) I normally just enjoy the building and painting but I played a game with a friend who is also sober. It was fun. My head maybe all over the place but I'm finding grounding myself to be easier. I am actually saying no to my friends that go out to get drunk. I do not want to lose contact but if they are truly real friends I won't. I just can't put myself at risk.

Tonight the plan is to finish work, watch an episode of a show on prime. Go to an AA meeting, cheeky because my favourite pizza place is down the road. But hey good to have something to look forward to.

After the meeting I'm going to grab a pizza from there, go home play some computer games, watch TV and chill. Have a nice fresh morning if the weather isn't to bad go to a morning meeting and then for a walk. 

One day at a time I will stay sober.",21

I never really vented on the internet before but I don't feel like it's a good idea to talk to anyone in my life about this at the moment, so reddit will do for now.

I don't really have an alcohol problem, but I'm afraid I might be walking firmly towards developing one. I'm M28, and I've been having a lot of stress during the last few months. The whole COVID situation has been honestly pretty traumatic for me, and since August, I am now working on two jobs, sometimes simultaneously, and still taking freelance work. What this means is that I'm always either stressed because of work, or stressed because of the current state of the world. And that light alcohol buzz has been a way I found to relax a little bit.

But I feel like I'm needing more and more to relax.

Yesterday I had the house to myself and I bought a fairly expensive bottle of wine for a pretty reasonable price (black friday deal), and I just... drank it. The taste kinda sucked and I somehow convinced myself that I was doing my wife a favor by just drinking it all and getting rid of it (because I knew she wouldn't like the taste). Right now is the morning after, I'm hungover and I'm honestly baffled by my reasoning to drink it all. Feels like something my brain just came up so I could justify getting drunk. It's honestly embarrassing that yesterday night I was that person.

Like someone else had made that decision for me, you know?

As I said, I'm not sure I am an alcoholic. I've been drunk like, 6 times in my life, but of these 6, 5 of them have been in the last 6 months.

I've been reading this sub this morning and reading pretty intense stories of how alcohol have essentially destroyed people's lives. I don't have anything dramatic happen yet, but I do feel like I might have to already put a very definitive stop to my blooming drinking career. 

Sorry for venting! Just wanted to express this in some way outside my brain. Hopefully writing this down helps me to take this seriously and deal with it while it's still easy to do.

Thanks for reading! Love you all!",11
2021-11-26 07:01:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2lmk0/365_days_ago/,365 days ago…,"I was a lost soul. I felt invisible. I hated myself. I was spiraling out of control. I was emotionlessly going through the motions of life. I was mentally and physically exhausted all the time. I was a shell of who I used to be, who I had the potential to be. I knew I had to stop drinking but I didn’t know how. I read the books, I tried to participate in the monthly abstinence challenges (which I successfully did a couple times, only to start drinking even more once the month was over). I had NO idea how to stop once and for all. I also never asked for help. Asking for help would admit that I had a problem and because I held a decent job, never was arrested, never got a DUI, never literally slept in the gutter, I thought my drinking was something I could control…until it wasn’t. I chalk up not getting fired or arrested or killed (honestly) to pure luck. 

What DID happen 365 days ago was this sub-Reddit. I don’t remember but I guess I found it a couple days before I decided enough was enough. I don’t know what caused this time to stick. I believe in a higher power and all I can say is it has to be that because I had SO MANY day one’s, I can’t count that high. Finding this group was a godsend. I have checked in every day for 365 days. I have actually made friends here. True friends. I have found the support I needed and then some, right here. I carry you guys with me everywhere I go because I know you’re just a tap away. 

I just want to say **THANK YOU**!!! Thank you to the mods who keep this place safe. Thank you to the old timers who provide a wealth of knowledge and support. Thank you to everyone who comes back day after day to check in and to provide support. Thank you to the day oners for being strong and asking for help. THAT is what I needed. THAT is what made the difference this time. Asking for help does not make you weak…it makes you stronger than you can ever imagine. To those struggling, please, I beg of you, just ask for help. It WILL make a difference. 

So in the words of Lyle Lovett, “And the moral of this story is, I guess it's easier said than done, to look at what you've been through and to see what you've become.”  I plan on becoming the greatest effing version of myself possible. Sobriety can help me achieve that. 

I love all of you more than I can ever express. You have saved my life. And for another day, I will not drink with you.",285

I have been slowly going back to having one or two beers a week. Thanksgiving I had 4 beers, spread out and didnt really feel anything but it doesnt feel right to not start my badge at day 1 today. I want my days to be continuous now. Tracking total days has been wonderful in helping me get to this point (100 total days since August!) but I am ready to fully commit. 

Here's what I have learned:
1. I like my sleep too much to drink.
2. I am crabbier when I drink. 
3. My anxiety/anger/sadness comes on strong after even a few days of having one drink.
4. My digestive issues are 100% alcohol related. 
5. Drinking does not cure boredom but creates it. 

So here's to another day 1-a chance to do better (since there is no such thing as starting over because I am already further than I was!) 🥳",32
2021-11-26 06:58:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2lkbd/i_officially_retire_from_drinking/,I Officially Retire from Drinking,"Two days ago, I took my last drink. I don't think I'll ever go back. 

I was in a bad mood and decided to numb my brain with booze, even though I should have known better. I went to a small liquor store near my neighborhood and asked for a bottle of my favorite whiskey. The cashier handed me a half bottle. (375ml)   I said ""no thank you, I'd like a full bottle.""

I was going to drink alone at home, so 375ml of whiskey should have been more than plenty. But no, of course I had to get the full size...  No normal drinker consumes a full size whiskey bottle alone in one evening. It's just not normal at all. 

Back home I planned on watching a couple good movies, but I barely made it through 15 mins before I got bored and started posting drunken nonsense on social media.

Around 8:45 pm I drank another glass, almost finishing the bottle, and I slipped on the ground and bruised my knee. My glasses fell off my face and I accidentally bumped them under a bookshelf.

By 9pm I was in bed, with a sore knee, not remembering where my glasses were, still pretty drunk. I ate a bit of food and drank a lot of water, watched Youtube videos for 2 hours, then slept. It was a very bad sleep, of course.

When I woke up I deleted the embarassing junk I posted on social media, even though everyone had already seen it. I felt a deep sense of shame and regret and self loathing.  I searched for a half hour before finding my glasses under the bookshelf. Luckily they were not broken.

I have decided to officially and permenantly retire from drinking. I never ever moderate, I always take it too far, and it's not fun. It really truly is not fun for me. I always regret it. It makes my life much worse not better. I am closing that chapter of my life.",20

I think I'm just done in a way. I think that's why nothing seems to work. All the stuff that seems to slingshot other people into a healthy life just doesn't do it for me. It's not that the help isn't helpful, it's that I'm helpless. Too far gone or whatever. 

I've spent the past few days sleeping about 12-15 hours a day. Didn't even post yesterday cause I didn't want to be a downer on the holiday. Everything after getting out of bed seems like a chore. I've already been diagnosed with depression so I know that's it, but now even going to therapy is a chore. Skipped my past few appointments. 

I want nothing with doing anything. I wish I could just take a week off work and sleep the whole week. I would say I'd be better off dying but man that's a horse that's been beat enough, just let it go. 

I'm not even ""sad."" If anything I'm angry but I really don't feel that way at all either. Anyways, I'm probably going to go offline for a while. I just want a break from everything",9

I knew I was the only non-drinker, and I knew she can get pushy with others for shots.  I was prepared going in to stay sober and I did it!!!

I had several delicious mock-tails and took lots of pictures and videos.  I chatted and enjoyed the evening.  I was really surprised at how sober everyone seemed.  I used to binge drink and over drink.  But nobody else appeared wasted, even though they had shots and mixed drinks.  My friends were good at pacing themselves.

The birthday girl asked me when I will start drinking again and I said I am not sure I will.  My mom is an alcoholic.  Both my brother and sister drink everyday (we know where that leads).  After a few questions and my very open responses the subject was dropped.  I got a mild teasing for not eating meat, not drinking coffee, and not drinking.  (What’s next, not having sex?!).  We laughed together and moved on from the subject.  

It was so nice to wake up this morning and have a regular lack-of-sleep headache and breastfeed my 11 month old guilt-free.  Life without hangovers is fantastic.

It started off with 5 or 6 drinks, usually vodka cruisers, a few times a week. I now drink at least a litre of spirits a week, creeping closer to two. (Bearing in mind I'm less than 110lbs). I drink almost everyday now. I mostly drink at night, but I'm drinking more often during the afternoon as well to keep away the shakes and anxiety. I didn't think I would have developed such a tolerance and dependence in such a short time. Not to mention the effects on my physical and mental health, finances, productivity, and relationships.

Honestly I can't believe it got so bad so fast. Even knowing the problems my drinking is causing me, I still can't stop. The longest I've gone without drinking since I started is 3 days, and that was following a health scare. I know that I need to stop, since I can't do moderation... I tried multiple times and failed, usually within less than an hour. But I don't really want to stop, because alcohol makes me feel better and I'm scared to lose that. And I get such intense cravings for alcohol. I know there are things I can do instead to feel better, but they don't work as well as alcohol.

I guess I'm just struggling because I know I need to stop, but it just doesn't feel worth it. I don't want to reach rock bottom before I sort my shit out and quit drinking, but I'm scared that's what it will take.

This is really long and probably sounds really dramatic, but oh well.",16

Day 2 was also hell. Couldn’t eat anything and my anxiety was through the roof. This was the day I met with my primary care doctor to be prescribed anti depressants 

Day 3 was horrible in terms of mood. Anxiety and sleepless nights. Idk if due to withdrawals or the side effects from the anti depressants. But on day 3 I finally ate a meal 

Day 4 - well. I woke up at 2am. Probably due to the anti depressants but could also be withdrawals. But I’m feeling relatively decent.

It's actually funny how the old adage is true. I definitely got to see who real friends were through this time. Long story short, 2021 has been the worst year of my life, but as of right now it's the year I got sober and stopped smoking cigs. However, I started to see the value in sacrifice. Even though drinking isn't a sacrifice at all for me anymore. That's because I see what it costs, and actually what I thought I was missing out on.
     Anyway, drinking is really lame. Like, truly. This sentiment is from someone who has been drinking for half their lives. For the longest time I could not and DID NOT want to imagine a life without drinking. There was just so much FOMO. I also thought it was the liquor or my friends. Turns out it wasn't quite like that. These past two weeks I went on and decided to hang out with my friends who were drinking. I mean like hard. Honestly, it's weird, I think you can drink hard without consequences as an individual, but I'm not one of those people. Basically I do not judge. So here's how that went. One time was with my roommate and our other friend. They drank and I smoked. So I wanted to really pay attention to them and myself. I was able to have fun, and they seemed to have fun AT FIRST. Over time they started to get a bit insecure even though it was just us and we weren't in public. They started to worry about what they would say, and just what you would expect. Nothing bad happened and they didn't act out of character or anything. It was just interesting to see. 
     I didn't think too much on that part, but I thought that was interesting. So now onto this week and seeing my friends back home. We met up and the same deal. I would smoke and they would drink. Everyone had their own thing going on, but this time we went to a bar. Again, everyone seemed to be having fun, but as time went on people were less enthusiastic and a bit insecure. 
     So time for observations. I told everyone in both situations mentioned that I would not be drinking way before I was in either situation. That meant when I was there I wasn't going to be hearing it. Of course I did from people back home, but I knew I would and I also knew that I wasn't going to make a big scene about my not drinking. Overall, I would say I experienced less resistance than I thought. It was necessary to not hide my sobriety. Next, I did have fun even without drinking. It was the people and that's not a shock. They're still my friends and I sincerely wasn't uncomfortable in a setting where everyone was drinking. I got all the usual drinking highlights I craved. Some deep talks, some cheap laughs, and some poor dancing. It was actually a great time. So the sad part was some friends who I told I wasn't drinking just didn't wanna hang. That's fine. It sucked honestly, but you know that's their choice. I need to be me. I also kinda didn't see the point in drinking weirdly. Like yes I could have, but I kept asking for what? There wasn't any real reason to drink. It also didn't seem like people were really loving it. They just did it and a few drank more than they wanted. They told me they forgot conversations we had, but I didn't. It was all great to me. So I'm less worried about not drinking from that side. 
    After drinking for so long it was liberating to be in a bar and not feel any crazy pull to drink. It felt like a choice. While I don't know if I won't ever drink again I am seeing more and more that I don't think I really want to. If I do I pray it's for a quick moment then back to it. I am going to keep my promise to not drink at all until I make it a year though. That's how this all started actually. First it was let's see, then for six months, now a year. 
    Unsolicited advice: If you are struggling try everything. Fail beautifully, but never stop trying. I tried so many different ways and it took over half a decade. I would relapse multiple times weekly. So if I can you can. I will say this though. It does need to be something that you truly want. That is the biggest difference between then and now. My best tool is the play the tape forward. If I am doing so honestly it's either not worth it because I'll be a fool or just because It's not true to me. This thanksgiving break was the first one I fully removed and I'm so thankful for that and also to know not everyone cares if I drink or not. My really close friends were proud of me. Hell I'm proud.

Tomorrow I'm having a long lunch with my brother, which has always implied sharing a few (lol hours of drinking) but I set myself up for success by texting him to let him know I'm staying dry and offering to pick him up and DD in case he wants to go a little hard himself.

During my early days in sobriety I often came to this page reading others stories and it truly helped out. I feel like I owe to this thread so I just wanted to share a couple things! I hope this can help anyone working towards sobriety or just having a tough day. 

I recently hit 7 months and yes I still have those tough days but what keeps me going is realizing how much better my life and my relationships have been without alcohol. For the first time in my twenties (currently 26) I feel like I love myself and can say my actions align fully with my goals. 

I’m sure many of you can resonate with this. I was that person that kept trying to get sober but kept finding myself at the liquor store picking up my favorite shitty whiskey only to get home promising myself I’d have one drink and topping off the whole bottle. Then waking up the next morning puking and shaking chugging a Gatorade heading to work and repeating the miserable cycle. I could type in and on about my journey but I just want to say for anyone struggling that I’ve been there and I still have my tough days especially since it’s the holiday season. Here are a couple things I do that help me and maybe they can help you. 

I do a lot of journaling so I can keep track of where I’m going. When things get tough I often read very dark days from my past then I read the a few from the great days since being sober. This has helped me because when I see how much life has improved it makes me want to stay miles away from alcohol. A quote I keep in my is “if I wanted a refund for misery I would head to the liquor store and pick up a bottle”. 

Another thing that has greatly helped me is living an active lifestyle. Seeing how much my body has changed since becoming sober is a constant reminder to keep going. This goes for mental fitness too, which I believe is the most important thing to keep for, especially for someone working towards sobriety. Alcohol simply makes you depressed, I promise as time goes on you’ll mentally feel much better,some days are tough because you can’t numb it with the devils water but it’s great to work things out with a clear mind. 

These are a few tips I wanted to share that have helped me. Like I said I feel like I owe something to this thread because reading others posts has helped me immensely. 

Anyways good luck to all of you on your journey! The sober life can be challenging at times but it’s truly the most rewarding decision I have made! When my tough days come I’ll be back on thread to read your posts!",11

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.""

- Aristotle

Good morning friends! I hope you all are well!

While looking for inspiration for today's DCI, I ran across that quote from Aristotle. It isn't exactly in line with the theme that I thought I was going to write, but as soon as I saw it, I had to have it.

What an interesting idea! Generally when I think about who I am, I focus on what I think and believe and feel. Those parts of myself that make up my inner life, so to speak. And yet. This quote doesn't mention how we feel or what we think at all. It says that we are what we do. We are the actions that we repeatedly take.

When I think about it, I think that I agree to a certain extent. I can tell myself what I think and what I want and what I believe, but isn't there a simple truth at the end of the day to what I actually do? And my friends, if Aristotle is right, then this commitment that we renew to ourselves and each other every day isn't *just* what we do, it becomes who we are. We are a community that chooses a better life, a closer relationship with our loved ones, a stronger connection to our emotions and reality, a triumph of strength and courage over addiction and fear. And we renew it every day that we check in here. We choose it again and again and again, until it is a habit, and that habit becomes a part of us.

I'm happy to make that choice once again with you. I'm happy to rub that habit just a little bit deeper into myself today. I'm happy to keep going after that excellence in whatever form it takes. And I'm happy that you're all here to do it too. 

I hope you have a wonderful day SD! IWNDWYT ❤️",274

2021-11-26 00:15:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2fkkc/21_days_sober/,21 days sober!!!,"Wanted to share this victory with the sub because it’s the longest I’ve gone without a drink in 4-5 years. Previously, I could never get past the first week and always relapsed into another 6-9 month bender - rinse and repeat. I wanted to share a few things I’ve noticed during this stretch of sobriety. 

1.) My sleep has finally started to improve. At first, I slept like total dog shit after cutting out booze. Recently though, I’ve found myself getting 7-8 hours of uninterrupted rest. This quantity of true restful sleep feels so foreign, but I find I am energized in the morning and my days end up being more productive as a result.

2.) I eat CONSTANTLY. I’ve found I substitute the calories I consumed drinking with sweets and carbohydrate rich foods. This isn’t a sustainable solution, but the additional caloric intake helps tremendously with cravings. For now, I’d much rather wake up with candy wrappers on my bedside table than an empty bottle.

3.) Outpatient group therapy is a Godsend and I should have pursued it much sooner. I know treatment is very personal and that outpatient isn’t for everyone, but having a community of people that I see 4 times a week has made me more accountable and has allowed for very cathartic venting and group problem solving.

4.) I’ve realized who my real friends are. Some people have responded positively and some have responded angrily saying that I am being a square or that I’m not fun anymore. Although the realization of which friends were “drinking buddies” and which ones were authentic relationships has been painful, I feel proud of this growth and change.

This sub is an incredibly supportive community and I encourage all those that “creep” here to take steps towards a healthier happier life. Sobriety is a choice. It is a difficult, painful, beautiful choice. It is a choice that needs to made every single day. I love you all and empathize with the tremendous burden that sobriety can be. You are not alone.

I had a great day, not drinking, but in the car it hit me that I was going home to nothing and I have to work tomorrow. I’ve been super anxious on my own lately and I wish I could spend more time with others. Alcohol normally drowns that for me, I’m also in a very transitional part of my life at the moment and alcohol drowns that anxiety as well. 

I was thinking back to 3 days ago when I was waking up for the umpteenth time with a horrible hangover and absolute dread about whatever the fuck I did the night before. I felt horrible, I looked horrible, the day was just awful. I hated myself. I hated how I felt. I hated how anxious I was looking at my texts/pictures/snaps to make sure I didn’t do anything stupid. That is MUCH much worse than the anxiety I feel about life that is also STILL there and even worse when I don’t feel good I just don’t think about it when I’m willing myself not to throw up on the bus or something. 

I hope this maybe finds someone who like me drinks to alter their mental health. I say alter instead of improve because, well, clearly it’s not. I love the taste and feel of alcohol but NEVER the dread and heartburn and hangover and generalized SICK I feel after I drink. It’s not worth it. I’m working on me for now and my mental health and once I get there I’m sure I’ll be better able to take care of my physical health but one thing at a time. I’m happy to talk to anyone about this further if you need someone to talk to.

Like many people here, the holidays are pretty rough for me. It’s when I drank the heaviest and it’s the time of year where I get the most anxious about potentially breaking sobriety. This year I decided I would work a short shift at work, not only to cover for someone but also to distract myself a bit

In the last hour of my shift, I had a guy break 12 bottles of beer at my register. And you know what? I think I handled it well

I cleaned it up myself so I ended up smelling like beer shortly afterwards which made me extremely anxious, but I’m proud of myself for being able to handle the situation and not having any desperate thoughts I know I would’ve had years ago

This may seem small but the little changes in my thoughts and behavior has been one of the main things that’s kept me sober for so long

My dad is alive, it could very well be nothing serious, and even in the worst case scenario it’s not even guaranteed my sister would actually commit suicide.

My sister on the other hand? No fucking way. Losing her, especially to suicide is my biggest fear. I wouldn’t stay sober, I wouldn’t even try to stay sober. 


Oh yeah, and even aside form our father, my sister is in an abusive relationship with a dude who sounds like a psychopath. So, I’m stressing about her regardless.

Last Christmas my parents invited one of their cousins to eat with us, and I'll never forget as I sat there through my first Christmas sober listening to this dude talk about how ""alcoholics will never be like you or me ever again, they do something to their brain that is irreversible"" and whatnot. All week I've been thinking back to that moment and having arguments with him in my head where I tell him everything I've wanted to say to him about his lackadaisical approach to talking about an issue with people present who he does not know very well.

This Thanksgiving, cousin is back. Right as we all finish eating, he gets a phone call and excuses himself. He comes back in saying he has to leave because his wife's mother just died from years and years of alcoholism. I guess she was around 55, my mom's age, and living in an assisted care facility because she couldn't walk anymore.

I just about cried. I tried to keep it together though because I didn't know her and I thought it would come off weird if I started crying over a lady I've never met. My family doesn't know about my addiction, at least officially, just that I don't drink anymore.

Following up with the spinal specialist next month.  My doc prescribed muscle relaxants and pain killers as well as doing a steroid injection.  I stopped drinking because I was worried about the interaction between meds and alcohol.  Plus I’m a really bad alcoholic that has been trying to quit for quite some time now so when I stopped needing the medications just kept going for one more day.  Thanksgiving is the only holiday that I request not to work as it’s only me and my SO in the state I’m living.  Being a big foodie love Thanksgiving though.  My SO started a new job so ended up working today so I’m home alone.  My SO also conveniently left 5 white claws on the counter…. Not sure if he’s trying to sabotage me so I’ll quit asking him to cut back on the drinking or if he just didn’t realize.  It would be so easy for me to walk in the kitchen and grab a white claw and no one would know and there’s not enough in there for it to go to terribly wrong.  However I know this is a slippery slope.  Just because it’s Thanksgiving I can treat myself I won’t drink tomorrow it will be fine.  That’s what the addict part of my brain is telling me.  I had two weeks in October before my bday popped up and that I’m just going to have a couple today turned into 2 weeks of heavy binging. Over my summer semester at college after missing an exam I broke down and told my professor about my AUD and that I was actively on a binge.  He let me retake the exam.  I passed the class with a C so eh. However he asked me how long my binge was and I told him 4 days what I did not tell him was those were 4 days of 24/7 drinking I would drink pass out wake up drink rinse wash repeat.  I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and if I’m going to make my life better I have to turn off that part of my brain that thinks I need a drink to celebrate the holiday.  So I’m going to do my best to not go pick up that can and have my first sober holiday in probably about 7 years. Sorry for the on and on but need to get it out of my system and remember why I’m doing this,8

Reasons  varying from the chaos of going to the liquor store everyday, sometimes multiple trips, to having every small interaction with friends be with a buzz and being so off centered. 

Physically, feeling unexplainably exhausted and depressed when the alcohol wears off.  I've considered quiting my job multiple times due to my deep unhappiness, then being overwhelmed by the reality that that isn't an option.

It is all  just a part of the loop that brings me to another drink.
Alcohol for me has recently seemed like a little escape that allows me to feel like things are different ~ I am different ~ but it has also led me into completely losing myself. 

Im writing this to hopefully keep it all in mind. I hope to post a bigger achievement in a few weeks.",21
2021-11-25 21:16:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r2cfwv/singling_myself_out_accidentally/,Singling myself out accidentally,"I just went to an event at a friend’s craft-brew bar. Early evening thing, not a big deal. I thought to myself about how not a big deal it was, knowing they have a great non-alc cider on tap. I love being at the point where I can go to events like these without it being weird.

But then I went and made it weird.

The bartender, a friend who doesn’t know I’m sober, was going on to the people I was there with about a particular type of drink - some sort of flavour nuance that was apparently love it or hate it. Everyone had a sip and continued to discuss it. Bartender says “I guess  you must already know you don’t like it”. I felt pressured to try it and like I had to explain myself, so I ended up saying “well, I’m a non-alcoholic kind of person these days, so I guess I’ll never know!” - to which he gave me a “well la tee dah” kind of response. Maybe what I said made it seem like I was implying that everyone else was an alcoholic, when I was really just trying to think of a funnyish way to say I’m sober. Then later he came around and asked if I wanted another cider. I said no. Realizing that meant I was only having the one free beverage that came with the event, I felt compelled to apologize for not being a better paying customer and like .. taking up a spot at an event at a bar without really supporting the venue. It just became a big awkward conversation.

None of this is a big deal, it’s just one of those subtle things that feels bad. Like all of a sudden I feel like that self-involved sober person who no one wants around at a party because they just keep talking about sobriety and making people feel weird about it, when all I really want it to proceed with my life without having to single myself out in that way. And the fact that I completely did it to myself is frustrating.

I guess the thing to do is work on whatever is internally motivating me to feel the need to explain myself and causing me to feel bad for taking up space in the world without paying for booze. 

Can anyone relate to this experience?",10

I'm in the US, Thanksgiving sucked. Why? All the typical reasons; family, lack of family, in laws, stepkids and their high conflict mother, watching all the other people drink. My husband is a great father but he has this bad habit when he gets around his family; he basically acts like he doesn't have kids, sits on the couch drinking and talking to his cousins while his mother and I keep up with the kids. Its exhausting especially because I don't have any family nearby and so being with all his family takes a lot of emotional energy when I'm missing my own.

My father in law, who is only 51, was recently moved to a nursing home on hospice; he has a hereditary disease that my husband has inherited the gene for. Every time I see my FIL I picture my husband in 10 years. Its heartbreaking. And this is his first holiday season in the nursing home so emotions were high all around. 

It was a very long day and by the drive home I was beyond irritable. I made up my mind. I came home, poured myself a very large glass of wine, then sat down at the table with leftovers. I had every intention on drinking that wine, but then I picked up my phone and checked this sub. I saw that 32 day count. I realized that I don't want to start over again. I didn't want to let myself down again. I gave the wine to my husband (as well as the leftovers which is an added bonus for me as I struggle with emotional eating.) I put my son in his PJs and put him to bed and told him I loved him. So this post is a pat on the back from myself to myself but its also a thank you to this subreddit and all the people in it. I don't know what I would have done if I didn't have you here tonight. Happy holidays. IWNDWYT.",34

He ended up leaving, which broke me (I don't fault him at all, I fucked up, I had just hoped he might stay). Now that I've taken a nap and sobered up we've texted some and he said he only left because he didn't want me to see him cry. He said he's in my corner always but is scared and confused.

It didn’t reveal a whole lot, mildly enlarged spleen, and things of that nature, but nothing my doctor was concerned about as far as causing pain.

They were very passionate.

Which is all good... but then I turned and looked at the restaurant. It was closed. I checked the hours and it had been closed for at least an hour at that point. Literally no one was inside.

Obviously it sucks but also…. Man, I used to spend entire days feeling like this after a drinking spree—and just felt like it was a normal consequence of a normal social habit.

I just opt out. I won't fight to be heard, I just go quiet. I've spent enough of my life fighting to be heard by people who aren't interested in listening to me, and I don't do it anymore. When people start talking over me, I stop talking.

I was out getting some late night food with a bunch of sober friends last night, and I realized after I left how much I'd talked. I talked about all kinds of things, I talked about things that I've done and experiences I've had in my life and expressed opinions and interests. And I realized that, in recovery, I have friends who are genuinely interested in listening to me. They genuinely want to know what I have to say.

It's causing me to reflect back on the sorta of conversations that I had with people in social situations before I started drinking. I've always had a handful of close friends, but with my wider circle of more casual friends and acquaintances, I barely talked about myself in any real or meaningful way. I hung out with a lot of people who were mainly interested in talking about what they were doing and telling stories about themselves. 

It takes two to tango, it also suited me to deflect the conversation back onto other people so I could hide in plain sight. But there was also an element of the childhood dynamic of shutting down because I'm not going to fight for attention. Which I don't think was necessarily a negative strategy, it's more about valuing myself enough to say that I'm worth listening to, and people who aren't going to treat me with respect don't deserve to hear my thoughts.

It's nice to realize that I don't have relationships like that in my life anymore. That even though I've still got plenty of things to work on and change, my relationships with other people have shifted. I no longer spend time with people who aren't really interested in knowing me, or who want me to sell myself to them by talking about what I'm working on or doing or whatever. I didn't try to make healthier decisions about who I hung out with, it's an organic change that happened as a result of spending time sober.

The title of this post comes from a lyric in a [Posies song](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JPktg9u84BU) It's a bit of a pensive, melancholy tune, it's not rousingly inspirational, but I think that it really suits the mood of what the early months of sobriety can be like. I've gotten sober several times before and I know this feeling. Things are changing, but not the way that I want them to or as fast as I want them too, and there's an ache. There's an element of pain and loss in any major change, and there's a lot of uncertainty about stepping into the unknown. 

I've gotten sober before and my last relapse was fairly short, so in some ways this is old hat for me. But in other ways this is different, it's still uncharted territory. I still have changes that I need to make in how I'm living my life and how I'm doing the work on myself that I need to do in sobriety. What I did the last time was enough to get me three years of sobriety, but then I crashed and burned, and I can see now how that happened. 

I need to go deeper in what I'm doing for my sobriety. I've changed my external life, but now there are things from my past that I need to process and deal with, and there are changes that I need to make in how I'm living my daily life, and changes in myself. I can see it now. 

Sobriety isn't a destination, it's a journey, and travel can be wearing. Sometimes it's boring, sometimes it's uncomfortable, and sometimes it's a little overwhelming. But it's a helluvan experience. And I just realized that, as awkward and difficult as this journey has been at times, I am where I want to be. I don't want to be in this particular spot forever, but I'm on the right path, and I'm happy. At this exact moment in time. (I'm counting days, so I might be in a foul mood tomorrow. Who knows. Early sobriety is still a bit of a rollercoaster.)

Anyway, that's where I'm at today. And for those of you in the United States, just remember that Thanksgiving is sort of a bullshit holiday where we just eat a bunch of food and not much else happens, it's *completely* not worth relapsing over. And your family knows how to push your buttons because they're the ones who installed them. Sending hugs to all my fellow sobernauts, thank you for sharing this journey.

I have started anti-anxiety meds and my doctor has prescribed naltrexone for cravings. I have hit rock bottom, funny thing is I have been sober on and half the last 4 years. I haven’t drank a lot. But mentally I have been in a bad space. I have severe anxiety. Drinking has always brought out suicidal thoughts in me. 

Now my friends and family all know about my struggles which is a huge relief. I haven’t been very honest about how much drinking affects me. I have my doctor and a therapist helping me with my alcohol addiction and anxiety. I am being assigned to mental health and addiction counsellor. I have my sister and husband who are my biggest supporters. I am feeling a lot better about my chances. I couldn’t ask for help and it almost killed me.

This is a classic case of me getting wound way up. Nothing is different today than yesterday. In fact, physically, today is better. I have the day off, I am 1 mo, 5 days more sober. Besides, I KNEW this would happen. I knew I would be refused. I knew I would emotionally crumble from it. I knew it would lead to me questioning my life path. I knew it would lead to me feeling so horrible and shamed and unwanted that I would want to leave my children on Thanksgiving. All of it. I already knew. For some reason, I thought maybe, just maybe it would be different this time. After all, there are no looming issues, no big anxieties, I am in remarkable physical shape for a guy my age. I have been climbing again, working out etc.. I thought maybe my sobriety would change things - even though she never knew I drank. My marriage has actually been a big drinking trigger for me in the past 10 years. We are domestic partners raising children, managing a house. That's all. The pain from lack of intimacy hurts - bad - and has for a long, long time. Today, I am ready to call a lawyer and rip the bandage off this wound. But, I dare not do anything when I am in this emotional state. Instead, be present for my kids, grateful for what I have, and shut the fuck up for now.

I went out to a networking event with my daughter  where everybody was drinking free champagne. 
In a split second at the drinks stand I took a glass of champagne and proceeded to take a sip. Why not I thought? I don't want to look like a wowser with my water glass.. one night won't hurt..everybody else is drinking so why not relax and enjoy the fun!!! 
Then a non drinker joined our table with his water glass. And I thought ..well I don't have to do this - look at him sober and cool -WHAT WAS I THINKING!!!
So I quietly put my champagne down on the table, chatted away, and then made my way over to the drinks stand -orderd a soda water in a champagne glass, got some snacks and returned to sober partying! Had a great night. 
What a close call! I am astounded how quickly my brain just switches into addiction and total denial and block-out of all the hard earned truths that I know about my alcoholism!  
 It was a good wake up call for me to see how precarious my sobriety still is. Going forward I will be doing a lot more pre-planning around high risk situations as clearly I am not yet free of this curse. Also I think I need to really challenge my misguided perception of drinking being cool and fun and that somehow I am missing out if everyone is drinking except me....its all just rubbish, brain tricks to feed my addiction..and I really don't need and cannot risk alcohol in my life at all..ever!

I don't live close to family, so it's just me and my bf. I don't do a whole turkey, and I'm only cooking sides and leftovers for two. But I usually drink during. I also (not coincidentally) usually wind up both annoyed he isn't helping and then annoyed when he does help bc he's doing things ""wrong.""

This year felt a lot less stressful. I could think more clearly and figure out how he could best help and appreciate he wants to despite not really knowing how to cook much. I had my kombucha in a nice glass with dinner (Well, lunch. Early Thanksgiving dinner is how he grew up and I don't mind.) and was able to really enjoy the food we made instead of bolting it down so I could drink more. Was also able to appreciate his help cleaning up instead of being a control freak about the kitchen, so that was also nice.

I'm once again going into work to care for the shelter cats this afternoon since once again I knew I'd be sober and up to doing it. I'd kind of rather a food coma, lol, but it does still feel good to be able to volunteer.

Idk, I know a lot of people have a lot more triggers today than I do, with a lot more going on. But it feels nice to have had a quiet meal, sober, and feel like I can relax today instead of running off alcohol, anxiety, and vague irritation. I did worry I'd feel like I was missing out without the alcohol on top of food to ""really mellow me out"" but I'm feeling pretty mellow even without it. IWNDWYT!

EDIT: I also didn't stop to take a pic of the food to post on social media this year.

I am very lucky that I did not lose my motorskills, have any weekness or memory lose that we can tell. I am completely numb on my right side. It's kind of like when your arm goes to sleep from laying on it wrong, that's my entire right side head to toe right now.

People often post their lessons, insights, tips, words to the wise, and I think I've got one worth sharing. 

Stopping drinking doesn't mean you are obligated or called to become an uber productive member of society. I'm so impressed by people writing about their exercise, cooking pancakes, exploring hobbies. And I look at what I did for the last 30 days. Basically jack shit. I didn't start running, I didn't become a baker, I'm not volunteering at a recovery shelter for abused cows. I watched Netflix, played video games, and did my work. That's it. 

But that was enough for me, and it didn't put extra pressure on me. The only rule has been just don't drink. 

Here's the lesson then. All that positive productivity seems to happen on its own. Got up yesterday and thought, I have no clean dishes and no clean clothes. I am going to clean all of it today. And I did. Never would have done that while drinking. I would have done one load of laundry and lost interest. 

That's not a marathon race, I'm not a budding artist rediscovering my love of water colors. I just did the dishes and laundry, all of them, and it felt good. 

For others on the path or joining the path, perhaps a good rule for the first 30 days is, ""do whatever the fuck you want. The only obligation is just to not drink.""

I have autoimmune issues (which the drinking obviously didn't help at all). At the beginning of 2020 I started a biologic medication. Great timing with Covid, right? Well, I took all the precautions I could to avoid Covid, but my follow up bloodwork came back positive for TB. Yes, TB is still a thing in the developed world. My chest x ray was negative, so apparently I have the latent version. I was likely exposed at some point in my life and my immune system kept it in check. But when I went on the immunosuppressive drug, the TB roared to life. I also had other blood markers that my doctor indicated was the result of regular drinking (anemia, etc).

So, infectious disease specialist puts me on the typical antibiotic protocol. The drugs themselves can cause liver damage, so it was explained that continuing to drink would basically cause liver failure. So I stopped cold turkey. 

I wasn't an alcoholic in the sense I wasn't physically dependent. When I stopped drinking to start the meds, I didn't have physical withdrawals. I never drank more than a few drinks at a time. I admit to occasionally overdoing it on weekends or certain occasions. But I did drink daily.  And it has been a challenge. I do sometimes miss my evening glass(es) of wine and that warm detachment from the day's stresses. 

I had bloodwork done a couple weeks ago and all the markers that were previously abnormal due to drinking have started to normalize. I'm sleeping better, I'm not bloated, I'm not constantly dehydrated, I'm clear-headed, my skin feels better, etc. 

Here's the deal though.  My husband still drinks - kind of heavily. His family are all drinkers. Thanksgiving has been a shit show some years. Basically I am going to be the only sober one today and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm honestly thinking about feigning illness. 

I'm also probably going to roll with the sobriety thing even after I stop the required course of meds. I'm not sure how this will affect my marriage long term. I've learned I really can't stand to be around my husband after he's drunk. He's a really happy drunk, but so irritating. I was probably the same way and that makes me cringe.

tl;dr  Not sure where I'm going with this. This is the first time I've spelled it out...",9

Can I just say what a shitshow the American mental heathcare system is, first off, because WOW what a fucking living nightmare that was.

4 days in a windowless room. With not so much as a crayon. Or even a bed. Just me and about 30 other nutjobs on what i can only describe as plastic waiting room style recliner chairs in one room.  For4 fucking days. Good god I hope that was enough to wake me the fuck up.

Because that's not the first time I've ended up in handcuffs or at a mental health facility after drinking too much. No no...that would be my 3rd time having a psychiatric evaluation, 2 of which ended in 72 hour holds and probably maybe about my 8th encounter with police. 2 of those times I ended up needing a lawyer to keep myself out of jail.  And I'm still wondering if the neighbors will press charges and I'll get arrested. Because apparently I was causing a disturbance by slamming my front door over and over and over and screaming at the top of my lungs and one of them was recording me? idk man. Fuck. I guess at least I'm still alive and not in jail....yet?

And a lot of people I knew or were close with DIDN'T get so lucky. I really really hope I don't end up like those people. But it's not looking good for me if I don't do some serious fucking changing and shaping up. I've been so stressed out trying to make money and get a routine going in a new place and I feel like I can't fucking get away from alcohol unless I just isolate and then I just get bitter and depressed and end up drinking anyway.

I hate going home  to my apartment because my neighbors are fucking awful and trigger me nonstop. One neighbor has a SCREAMING infant and leaves all the windows and doors open so its like...it may as well be in my apartment.  Another neighbor SLAMS THE FUCK out of his door ALL DAY LONG. My boyfriend likes to have the occasional drink and to go out to bars sometimes.  Literally within 24 hours of me getting out of lockup he and his buddy were pouring tequila in the kitchen. I went to waffle house. (yay for tiny successes).

To top it all off I've only been a bartender for the last 10 years and to be honest cant afford a paycut but am not qualified in any other field to make the same money. Also apparently I cant pass a background check due to the reasons I mentioned above. The job I have right now is at least a breakfast joint so its not like the ""lets do shots"" type of PM bars I used to work at. 

But you see what I mean?

I just ....need help. If anyone lives in the Phoenix area and knows of good resources for someone who just moved here please reach out. I will say I have not had great success with AA in the past if its very christian based, but am willing to give a more spiritual based method a shot.

Anyway....thanks if you read all this. Happy holidays. Sorry for the long post. IWNDWYT",6

And Happy Thanksgiving to everyone!,"Two years ago today I hit my bottom and spent the night in jail instead of with family. But it was the right wake-up call that I needed. I had been a heavy drinker for 20+ years, but always justified it because I was never an everyday drinker, and would stop drinking for periods of time here and there (like alcohol free Lent, etc). At least that’s the line I would tell myself.

Now that I’ve had two years of sobriety, it’s amazing looking back at just how delusional I could be about alcohol. How my brain could always find an excuse for a drink or justify a craving, or downplay my addiction as something I had control over. And to be honest, my brain still does that. The cravings are still there, but it’s much easier to dismiss them now.

I kind of liken it to a hot looking girl with a plump booty walking by. My brain is still gonna go “wow! Look at that!” But I’m mature, and married, and very happy with my life, so it’s easy to not stare, to not go hit on the poor girl, and to just acknowledge that caveman desire and move on in the next second.

One of the biggest fears I had in the first months of sobriety is that the cravings wouldn’t go away and I would be cursed by always wanting alcohol for the rest of my life. And that is what happened, but what’s amazing is I learned how to live with it, and make it not a big deal. I have built a good support system and lean on them when I need to, I talk to my therapist regularly, I continue to re-examine my life and my values and work on my imperfections, and you know what? Life is pretty grand without alcohol, cravings and all.

Today is my 5th week of sobriety from drinking and other substances. This is actually my first time abstaining from everything including marijuana. Im feeling very motivated to stay sober this holiday season but wanted to check in as a precaution and sort of as maintenance in my recovery program.

Me and my family are kind of approaching a crises because we are being kicked out of my fathers house. I won’t go into too much detail but for the past few months our living arrangement has been made extremely difficult due to him and it has just gotten to the point of irreconcilable differences. A lot of the issues have come from what I now realize was past mental and emotional abuse and neglect by him. Now that I’m older I have recently come to the realization that my father is an unstable person. It’s been weird processing all of this because I had always believed that I was just a dysfunctional child that was put together wrong. A lot of those thoughts and emotions are, I believe, what developed into addiction.

So here we are on Thanksgiving day being kicked out. I know that the only way to handle this situation is by not drinking first and foremost and I’m actually not having thoughts of relapsing or anything but I feel like posting on here is extremely important to my recovery maintenance. I’m in a non intensive outpatient recovery program but due to the holidays and my busy schedule I wasn’t able to attend yesterday’s group so I wanted to be proactive and constructive today with how I handle this stressful situation. It’s like they say in group, accept the things you cannot change and my father is the thing I cannot change. What I can change is how I react and deal with the situation.

Anyways, I needed to vent about it and I feel a lot better after typing this out already. It’s a big change in how I would have handled it in the past. It’ll definitely be something to share in group tomorrow lol. So cheers to all of you out there and thanks for listening to my family drama and I hope everyone has an awesome and sober Thanksgiving! And those of you still struggling I promise you if I can do this you can too! 8 years ago I never would of thought I could live a happy life sober and now I’m experiencing a new passion and motivation for living so please don’t give up.",9

I was going to miss it so much!  Feeling sorry for myself during dinner when friends were here, merrily drinking with my husband who had drank all day as is tradition.  Feeling empty and unfulfilled, wondering if I can do this.  Feeling bored and grouchy.

But then waking up the next morning feeling SO DAMNED PROUD OF MYSELF for moving into this new life, as uncomfortable as it can be sometimes.

I feel like it’s kind of the lesser of two evils though right? I could kill myself or I could drink until I pass out…

UPDATE: I made it through the night without drinking or killing myself. I texted with a helpline and then managed to get some sleep. I’ve woken up feeling sort of numb/flat which is very preferable to how I was feeling last night.

And I continued on drinking as I had been until about a week and a half ago, I guess I hit rock bottom. I drank a bunch of wine after the kids went to bed and when that ran out, I drank vodka until I was black out drunk. I don't really remember much but I fell somewhere and hit my head. Hard. I woke up the next morning feeling like death warmed over, depressed, ashamed, disgusted with myself. I cried all day. 

I threw out the rest of the vodka that morning and decided I'm done. And that actually went pretty well, considering. Of course every day I contemplated going to the liquor store but I didn't. Until yesterday morning I went grocery shopping and got 2 bottles of cheap wine to *reward myself* for not drinking. That makes no sense!! But it's what I did because life is just really hard right now and I guess I'm trying to cope. So all day I was thinking about that wine, checking my watch to see how much longer til I can start drinking, and looking So forward to drinking it but I wanted it to be perfect. The perfect time to really relax and have a drink. Well I have kids so that time didn't come. I mean it was for them that I really decided to stop drinking in the first place. They deserve a better mom who's not hung over and tired every day and drunk every night. That makes me so sad.

Anyway, I didn't even open the wine! It's still sitting in the fridge. For me, that's kind of a huge thing because for a very long time I couldn't say no and once I started I was going til I couldn't hold my eyes open any longer - **every night** I was at least somewhat drunk. But last night I was just like... I'm tired now. I'm going to bed. Even though I'm ashamed that I even felt I needed to buy it in the first place and even though I struggled with myself in the aisle of the grocery store trying to talk myself out of buying it, but failing.. I didn't drink it. I'm still struggling like those bottles are what I'm thinking about first thing this morning and I know I should go right this second and just pour it out but I can't yet I guess. I'm hoping my willpower stays intact today. I don't post much but reading this sub helps me get through rough days so thank you all and thanks for listening

It wasn't easy to quit drinking, but it was, I know, much easier than it would have been in the UK without the British drink and pub culture everywhere. 

When I quit drinking, the drinking friends that I did have where I live assumed that I no longer wanted to join on Friday night bar crawls, and I stopped getting invites and started spending more time with friends that drank less. 

That wasn't such a big deal as people outside the UK don't generally know me as a big drinker, but my old group of friends I grew up with have always known me when I was drinking. We grew up together and drank heavily together from our early teens.

I moved back to the uk last month, and the pro drinking culture is starting to get to me. I had a date monday night--drank too much. I had a social event last night--drank too much. This morning I feel like rat piss. I hate it. I hate it i hate it i hate it. 

I've started getting an ache in my right side the morning after i drink. Not painful, just a little ""huh i can feel something where i dont usually feel anything"". Its starting to worry me, that I've damaged my body beyond repair simply because I'm too stupid to stop doing something I dont even wanna be doing. I literally havent told anyone about it, that's how much I hate that shit.

I'm ready to give it up. I'm really ready. If today is my sober day 1, I'll have a month by christmas. I'm spending it alone so itll be the only gift I get, the best one I can get myself. I might put the saved money towards a new guitar too. 

My plan at the moment is basically: eat cheesy noodles and attempt to feel human again. Then do my dishes and take the empties out if my room. Resist the urge to google ""right side aching after drinking"". Start reading This Naked Mind again. I'm gonna try and finish it by monday. Once I have, I'm gonna write out a list of all the reasons I think I drink. The rationalisations. Then I'm gonna write out why they're bullshit. I'm gonna put the list up on my mirror. I'm gonna remind myself that I'm worth more than poison. More than feeling like crap, wasting days and money and health for nothing. 

Any tips, advice, ruminations or chastisement is welcome. I havent made the promise in a long time, but IWNDWYT",15

Today I don't have much planned. My boyfriend and I are moving in a couple weeks, so we are packing and cleaning, and then enjoying a nice dinner, just the two of us. Our families canceled due to being sick. Not complaining, kinda happy to have something low-key. 

I just wanted to share my milestone. I will be attending my first AA meeting this Sunday. (I was supposed to go last week but had an emergency). It is located in the town I am supposed to move too and I have attended before. It is a good meeting with good people. I am ready for the next step in my sobriety and I don't want to do it alone anymore.

I had actually given up drinking earlier in the month but had taken a drink on the 24th. 
I went to my first meeting that night, a midnight meeting, and thought to myself, “how the hell did I end up here, I don’t belong here”.

I started this journey thinking I might make it past Christmas, but I couldn’t imagine a future where I went my entire life without drinking. 

I was depressed, suicidal, living in a fog, forgetting who I was. I was in and out of school, treating people poorly, isolating myself and destroying my health. 
Not much of that changed on day 1 nor day 10. 
As I’ve read here before, sobriety doesn’t open the gates of heaven, it opens the gates of hell and lets you out. 
But it’s hard work making your way out. 
Our afflictions are not limited to alcohol. Our struggles go much deeper than that, and usually that is why we turn to alcohol. 

My point is, if you’re getting sober, you need to learn to love yourself, forgive yourself, and take care of yourself.  I have grown and healed a lot in my sobriety and that’s been my main focus. Even in this past year I’ve healed and learned more than any other year of my sobriety. 

The challenges go on, but you’re fighting for the most important thing there is, and that’s yourself. 
————

My last sentiment: Nothing grounds me in my sobriety more than listening to someone who is trying to give up drinking. Hearing the emotion, empathizing, and remembering how scary the first days/weeks/months always are.

To those of you who don’t feel worthy of sharing,  or that don’t feel worthy of help, please speak up.  It gives us all an opportunity to heal and learn.",46

This year has absolutely been the worst in my life. In January I suffered a miscarriage at 12 weeks, and now for two subsequent months in a row I have had early miscarriages, one we found out about just yesterday. I am absolutely devastated, angry, all the bad things. All I want to do is numb out (and alcohol is how I had been doing that periodically this year).

Logically I know that alcohol didn’t and won’t make anything better, and I will not drink today. But in my previous 8 years of sobriety I guess I never had to truly cope with anything of this magnitude. 

I guess I want to know how you all deal with the tough times in sobriety? What sort of coping skills do you utilize?

Buckle up, y'all. It's 3:34am, and I'm sitting on my couch drinking coffee. I'm in the good spot of the sectional - right in the corner - and for the moment I don't have to fight anyone for it. I've been awake since I went to sleep, if you can wrap your head around that, but I got out of bed to the sound of distant thunder. Now my windchime is rattling in the rain and my old dog is snoring next to me. Under most circumstances, I'd call this heaven.

But it's Thanksgiving, and this one feels particularly painful. For those of you who find this day to be important and fulfilling I wish you nothing but the best. For those who struggle, I am here cheering you on. Really. You CAN do this. I am somewhere in the middle, oscillating each year between enjoyment and dread. This year, it seems, is all dread. I am the family entertainer, you see. I am the peacekeeper, the second in the kitchen. I am the dish-doer and the gracious daughter/wife/mother/friend. I am cheerful and witty, I anticipate everyone's needs. May I pour you another glass of wine? Oh, the dogs tracked in mud, let me grab the mop.

But the problem is I haven't stopped crying since yesterday morning. I am emotionally empty, and that won't be fun for everyone else! Where is cheerful Rusty?! Rusty, what is wrong with you?! Rusty, why are you acting this way?! It turns out that in the absence of my boozy comfort blanket, I'm not so great at pretending to be happy. But it also turns out that when I'm not pretending to be happy, it makes a few people in my life very angry with me. How dare I not be what they want me to be? I know, I know...just ignore them, right? Well, when there are only a few people in your family and you feel like your heart is dangling in your chest by an arteriole (think blood vessel instead of artery), it's not fun to be the target of all passive aggressive dissention. 

Until late last evening I thought I was banned from Thanksgiving due to a cold. Hallelujah! I may be bored shitless but I won't have to smile! No such luck; I was informed my number had been called up, cold or not. 

So I sit here pondering my life. Coming to terms with the loss of something that made me feel truly happy, free from falsehood. Seen. Alive. And spread before me is the reality of the coming days. How much more will I cry when this is finished? When I've faced down the wine boxes and beer cans? When I've poured the aperitifes and scrubbed the turkey juice out of the corner of the baking pan? What, if anything, will be left of Rusty? And who, if anyone, even cares? All that matters is that I stay positive, set the table properly, and exude all the charms of a southern hostess.

So I will be there. I will be the daughter, the wife, the mother, the friend. I will pour the drinks and sip soda water. All the while further cracking under the pressure of myself and my inability to break the cycle. But at least my mascara won't run because I will never let them see me cry.",43

I pretty much stayed in bed the whole time. The pills helped me get to the point of almost not being able to move. I did nothing most of the time.

The depression was brought on by so much .    
To break it down. It started in 2019. These events all took place .

I quit my job
 I lost my apartment
I had nowhere to go with my dog and my parrot
I had to stay with Ex husband who is insane and will year you apart verbally. He actually caused me and my son to have PTSD
I stared drinking after 6 months sober.
Ex got me arrested. 3 days in a cell for domestic violence. No charges where made.
Next came the restraining order. He lied
My son Oded. I found him in motel room.
My dog died . This was devastating, she was my comfort in all the drama
 I became homeless for a month, I stayed in my car with a new friend ,my dog , and my parrot.
Next stop Mexico, cheap to live 


Now comes the depression, removed from my home in USA
Starts the pill popping. It replaced the alcohol so I got 16 months sober
2 years happened and I stayed in bed pretty much. I took care of things like grocery , laundry. I cooked . Took care of my pets.
The futon was my home. 
So my friend's here on Reddit stop drinking, I've been coming here for 5 year's
 I've been sober many times.
I always turn to here for the support it's give and take.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""I may not be where I want to be but I'm thankful for not being where I used to be."" -Habeeb Akande

""Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend."" -Melody Beattie

Good Morning, friends! 

It's Thanksgiving here in the US, where I live. I know that many friends live all around the world, but I hope you won't mind if I muse about thankfulness today.

I think that for me, sobriety and gratitude are so interwoven. Recognizing the beautiful and joyful is a huge key to maintaining my sobriety, and it's through sobriety that I am clear headed and open hearted enough to recognize and hang on to the beautiful and joyful. Certainly, this world and this life is not always gorgeous. As an addict, I could tell you all about ugliness and pain. But when the gorgeous is found, it opens something up in my chest that makes me ache in a way that feels like singing. And that's something. 

So today I want to revel in the things I have to be thankful for. I want to roll around in my blessings, toss them up in the air, like Scrooge McDuck in a vault full of cartoon money. I want to close my eyes and take a huge breath and be thankful for eyelids and air. 

I'm thankful for my sobriety. I'm thankful for all of the times I lost my sobriety because they taught me lessons that I would need for the next try. I'm thankful for the watch on my arm that tells me it's time to get up, it's time to move, it's time to rest, and it's time to live, always, now, because the minutes are always moving forward. I'm thankful for children who are sweet and loving and maddening and hard because they are a tether to the present and a promise of the future. I'm thankful for fizzy water and chocolates because of course I am. I'm thankful for all of the opportunities I missed because they give me the motivation to pursue the opportunities I will take. I'm thankful for today. I'm thankful for all of you. 

Happy Thanksgiving, SD. IWNDWYT ❤️",348

Early on I started compiling a list of quotes and phrases and saved them to a note in my phone to revisit anytime I needed to. Most of these are from words of encouragement you have shared with others, and some are from books/podcasts I have learned about from this group. 

So thank you everyone, I wanted to share my favorite ones. 

-	The ones that matter don’t mind, the ones that mind don’t matter

-	My drinking wasn’t about drinking, it was about escaping but I ended up in a spiritual prison

-	Addiction is giving up everything for one thing, recovery is giving up one thing for everything. 

-	Normalize being grateful you got sober while still grieving who you were before everything 

-	The goal isn’t to be sober, the goal is to build a life you don’t want to escape from. 

-	Let that shit out. And sit with it. 

-	Some things have to end for better things to begin. 

-	Fall is proof that change is beautiful

-	I choose to treat myself with the love I deserve

-	You are always one decision away from a totally different life. 

-	In order to love who you are, you can not hate the experiences that shaped you into this person. 

-	Sobriety delivers what alcohol only promises. 

-	Play the tape forward

-	Instead of feeling shame or remorse for your past self, be proud of her. She did the work, she fought hard shit, she pushed forward. Love her. 

-	Alcohol weakens people, sobriety makes them stronger. 

-	Alcohol can take everything away from you and still tell you it’s worth drinking. 

-	If in active addiction you think about drinking every minute of the day, one day is 1,440 times you’ve told yourself no. Don’t sell yourself short. 

-	Perhaps it’s not that this gets easier but each day I get stronger. 

-	Tomorrow morning I won’t regret not drinking, but I will regret drinking. 

-	The hangover is worse than the craving

-	Excuses are just lies we tell ourselves. 

-	You hit rock bottom when you stop digging

-	Blame is giving away your own power

-	The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new. 

-	So what if no one recognizes my milestones. That means they don’t focus on me being an addict and that is what I should prefer.",16

Alcohol controls me. It controls my moods, how much fun I have in a given day, my relationship. It’s always in the back of my mind, lurking around like me on this sub lol. I fucking hate the control I give alcohol. Because at the end of the day I cannot fathom how an inanimate lifeless bottle filled with liquid controls me, that can’t be possible! 

Or atleast this is what I’ve told myself for the 15+ years I’ve been drinking. I started like “most” kids from a small suburb town, getting alcohol poisoning from drinking shitty vodka from a PS bottle and almost dying in a field. And I fucking loved it.

Fast forward to grown me. Many a blackout, hangover, bruises, tears, and putting myself in horribly dangerous situations. Giving my partner a heart attack every time I went out and got obliterated, not knowing if I was okay or even alive. Waving his fear and anxiety off, he’s exaggerating, I’m fine. 

I’m wasn’t fine and I’m not fine. What I am, is a high functioning alcoholic who is going to fuck my entire life up I don’t finally admit that out loud and make a real change.  

I’m going to my first meeting tomorrow morning. I’m nervous. I’m making every excuse in the book.

“It’s thanksgiving they probably won’t even have it today.” 

“I’ll be really busy making all this food what if I’m not back in time to finish everything?”

“What if I can’t even find the right place? What if I don’t have the fucking guts to walk in?”

I’m telling myself to suck it up because this ends now. IWNDWYT.

***UPDATE***

I went to my first meeting! Thank you all so much for the encouraging words. I woke up this AM and read all the comments, it really helped motivate me to get up and go. And I honestly really enjoyed it! I mean the best I could being in AA 😂.

2021-11-24 22:54:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1n9sd/my_gratitude/,My gratitude,"This is a good time of the year to give thanks and to be gracious. Let me preface my thanks with my back story.

I began drinking in my teens(I'm 43 now). I drank a 6 pack of Bud at a party. It was like I figured out the solution to the way I was feeling. All the negative thoughts and insecurities were silenced for the first time. I had a relatively happy childhood with no major trauma to speak of. I chased that drunk feeling for 20 plus years.

My 20s were a party. Friends, chasing girls, and many good times. But I always knew somewhere in the back of my mind there was a problem. No run ins with the law, no violent episodes, but drinking began to become the most important thing in my life. It became a crutch and a way to deal with problems.

I met my soon to be wife in my late 20s. Drinking was a major part of our relationship. After we began having kids she quit and never picked it up again. She can take it or leave it. Something I can't comprehend. Once the party was over I continued to drink at home. And more and more often alone after everyone went to bed. I began hiding my drinking, A) because I didn't want my wife to know how bad it was and B) I didn't want my kids to be exposed to it. I always preferred drinking alone. 

My 30s were spent drinking alone at home mostly. It goes without saying I now needed more and more to get to that sweet spot in my mind I was chasing. Beer turned into wine and that turned into distilled spirits.

I gradually began drinking during the day. Vodka usually. This is when alcohol began to turn on me. Hangovers turned into withdrawals. I began counting the time until the liquor stores opened in the morning. Running out of booze became a crisis. Drinking began to bleed into my work. There was little to no joy in doing everyday things like walking my dog and playing with my kids. It was as if I was living life while wearing concrete boots. Drinking at this point was maintenance just to get relief.

The mornings were the worst. I would wake up with a feeling of impending doom. The anxiety was almost unbearable. I would be nauseated. I would dry heave over and over for mornings on end. My appetite was gone. It took all I had to force down food. I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.

Now I had quit drinking thousands of times before in my head. Nothing seemed to work. I had countless day ones. I managed to string a month together this past summer. A vacation threw that streak out the window.

So what is different this time? I came clean with my wife. I got a therapist. I began to go to meetings. And for me the most life changing resource was Recovery Elevator Pod Cast. I have learned connection is the key for me. Hearing like minded people's stories and sharing my own is paramount.

So what am I thankful for.... Obviously I am thankful for my family, friends, and all I have. I also came clean with my doctor after all these years. He of course ordered blood work. I was highly anxious to received the results. My drinking had given me countless days of stomach pains, back pain, head aches and other pains. After 20 plus years of pouring poison into my body I feared the worst. My result came back and to my utter shock. I am in perfect health. My doctor stated he would not mind having numbers like he saw on my report. I don't know how this can be true. I've heard stories from other drinkers who drank way less than me who are dealing with fatty liver or worse. I have been given this great news and for this I am thankful.

Of course hearing this news, my alcoholic brain immediate tried to rationalize going back to drinking again. But I have not. I have 33 days and something is different this time. I don't want to drink anymore. And I will not today. I hope this story helps at least one other person today.  Alcohol worked for me until it didn't anymore. If you want to get and remain sober it can be done. But we all need each other. It is near impossible to do it alone.",14

2021-11-24 22:46:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1n4al/sobriety_doldrums/,Sobriety doldrums,"This time last year my life was crazy. I was off of the worst part of my September-October bender but still had a high tolerance and drank every chance I could get. I thought the fact that I could *mostly* control myself meant I was fine. I just liked to drink. I was still scaring my friends with how much I could put away and denying the fact that I drank to cope, but I had it under control so I was fine. 

I now have about 6 weeks of total sobriety and the pink cloud period is over. I’m lonely and being only 6 weeks removed from my favorite loosening up  “let’s have sex” party beverage (let’s forget the fact that it made me settle for men way below my standards) the temptation… isn’t high but it’s there. 

I’m at the point where I know that having a beer or two wouldn’t ruin my life but in 3 months I’m going to be back in that bloated, grumpy, miserable headspace and arguing with myself about whether a glass of wine or the whole bottle would relieve my shitty feelings. 

I’m also going to be on Tinder scrolling through boring “man with a fish” photos as my nightly hobby trying to relieve my loneliness because drinking and being a hoe were the only ways I could think to pass my time. 

I’m still in the best headspace I’ve been in years. I have goals, I have wonderful friends who would give me the world and I would do the same. I’m in therapy for allllll the trauma backlog I’ve been running from and I am finally on the track to become the person I want to be. 

But I have to say that absent the roller coaster of drinking’s highs and lows my life is bland. I work too much and don’t have enough time for myself. I only need to make it 4 more weeks at my job before I can quit and find something that supports my personal goals in a better way. 

I’m not going to break trust with myself over the most important promise I have ever made. I’m not going to throw this new vision of my life away for some shitty drunk sex. I’m trying to remember that on the other side of this is the most amazing life I could ever ask for, relationship included. 

But the slog is real. I’m so tired of waiting.",10
2021-11-24 22:45:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1n410/two_is_better_than_one/,Two is better than one,"Two years ago today I made a decision that altered the course of my life for better. I finally decided to let go of all the excuses, all the self made problems, all the anger and resentment. I sat down and had a long hard discussion with the man in the mirror, and I had decided where my life was and where it was heading was not where I want to be anymore.

Two years ago today I decided to stop poisoning myself everyday. To stop starting my day in the negative only to end each day in complete blackness. To stop taking my problems out on myself and everyone around me.

It's amazing how much substances can take over your life day by day, so slowly that you don't even realize how much else is it is taking in the process. At the end I didn't even have a personality outside the substances I abused on a daily basis. After continuing to talk to the man in the mirror I can so I'm proud of the man who had emerged from that place.

Two years ago today I decided it was time to be sober. I was done making excuses, and that I would be better. I owed to myself as well as those around me. For those who stuck around for those dark times I thank you, and for those who couldn't; I understand. I was incredibly toxic to be around. But without all of you I would be where I am today.

Two years ago today I made the best decision of my life, and I hope my story can inspire others to walk the same path. We do get better. We deserve it for ourselves and those around us.

It is not easy, but it worth it.

Safe travels.

Even if no one reads this, I’m posting here for my own sake and I hope you don’t mind that tonight. The holidays are rough. 

My sister‘s kids were exposed to Covid today and now we won’t see them for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I’m very sad because we haven’t had a normal family holiday since 2019. This might sound not worth getting upset over, but I’ve been looking forward to this family gathering for a few months. I really missed it last year when we all distanced. 

Now feeling down, I have a strong desire to go on a beer run, but what would that accomplish? Instead of going to bed in an hour and waking up well rested tomorrow, ready for a nice Thanksgiving, I would drink until 2AM and then show up tomorrow exhausted and probably hung over. 

I will still get to hang out with my parents, wife, and kids tomorrow. It will still be fun. I can focus on the positive that we will have a lot of good food and terrible NFL football.

2021-11-24 22:36:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1mxg3/drinking_nostalgia_is_biased/,Drinking nostalgia is biased,"Tomorrow morning marks 60 days for me without a drink, which is now the longest period of time I’ve had completely sober since I started drinking at the age of 15. (I’m now in my late twenties)

There are some things I’ve learned this time around that I think are critical to realize, and they were almost my downfall on multiple occasions in the last two months. The first, and most important thing that I recognized was the fact that I had frequently recalled what my brain thought were the “good times”. Those times when drinking made me feel “at ease, happy, or relaxed”, came back to my mind without much coaxing or effort. The insidious part is that I never seemed to recall the frequent times when I’d have too much, get the spins, feel sick, make a fool of myself, start fights with my wife, feel like my heart was going to explode, get a wicked hangover, or have soul crushing depression for days after drinking before abusing my body again with the next binge. I never remembered those times when I had close calls and almost ruined my life or my dignity. 

The second thing I learned is that the mental gymnastics I’ve been trying to play out in my head to justify me being able to have a few drinks again doesn’t occur in the minds of people who do not have an alcohol abuse problem. My wife for example can have a single drink and not have another one for months on end without any focused effort, and stopping after one drink doesn’t bother her nor trigger some urge in her to skirt the edge of a numb, comatose, euphoric oblivion like it does in me.  I wasn’t ever satisfied with a couple drinks. I wanted to ride the line as far as I could take it to that fleeting escapist edge of either blackout or illness, regardless of my resulting behavior or the consequences.  When I couldn’t get to feeling the way I wanted in an evening because I didn’t have enough, I would feel empty and as if I wasted my time because I drank some of my alcohol and didn’t reach that pinnacle of a drunken warm embrace from the bottle.  There was something about going that hard that shut everything out and yet was never as good as the times before, leading me to drink more and chase those old feelings. 

Being sober now for two months I have realized that this pattern of thinking and behavior surrounding drinking is deadly.  With every day gone by I feel as though the danger of a drink is increasing exponentially.  Not drinking has locked up my inner shadow and it’s standing there behind a metal wall of sobriety waiting to hit me harder then ever before, and the longer it’s locked up the more deadly it becomes to open that door again. 

I’ve got to learn to not listen to the rambling and pleading behind that door, and simply toss away the key forever. I truly believe that going back from this point would be a final fight I can’t win, and I need to make it a habit of remembering just how deadly that encounter would be. 

Nostalgia is dangerous, see it for what it is, a lie to get you to unlock that door and give alcohol the chance to end you once and for all.  

I’m sorry for the dramatic tone, but it’s the only conception that gets me to take each day sober more seriously.",21
2021-11-24 22:33:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1mveb/todays_the_first_day_in_22_years_i_returned_to_aa/,Today's the first day in 22 years I returned to AA,"I crashed and burned Tuesday. Two fist fights, crashed my car into my truck, blacked out at a bar, cracked my head so EMT drove me to the ER, my clothes were cut off and thrown out, my shoes got lost, I woke up in restraints with nothing on but my socks and fit bit on. I guess I fought in the hospital. Luckily, I could only find my bullets and not my guns. 

I'm so sick and tired of being this way. I begged the hospital to let me detox but instead they made me leave the hospital in a gown and socks in 30 degree weather. I need to detox but no insurance. I should not go cold turkey if I've been drinking over a pint of titos a day for a year and drinking daily my entire adult life with the exception of pregnancy once. I'm 42 now and my son deserves better.

I don't want to drink any more. I did consume 2 measured shots several hours apart way earlier today to help with DTs and have stayed hydrated and took my vitamin b complex. No more alcohol is in my house now so that's good but scary. The headache is killing me. I'm reading online about at home attempts but it's not looking good. 


I'm glad I went to AA today. I'm glad my friend drove me so she could go too. I know I'll need to do something more tomorrow. I reached out to my therapist too. I'm done with the lies. Wish me luck! I'll need it. Thank you for reading my story.",16

Alcohol is a carcinogen and neurotoxin. It is in no way, shape or form concluded to be good for you. Recent peer-reviewed studies are showing all alcohol-related risks increase with the amount of alcohol consumed. 

Click-bait articles spread online are meant to generate clicks and sell ads. They'll say anything to get you to click on their link. ""Intelligent people drink more alcohol"" and ""Drinkers live longer"" are just a couple examples I see everywhere. I've read through a few entirely, to see if they would say their claims are inconclusive or warn people of dangers but many don't bother.

Almost every ingredient claimed to be beneficial in alcohol is available in larger amounts through exercise, sleep, or extracts. The alcohol amount containing effective doses of beneficial ingredients would require abuse. Non-alcoholic drinks and bars are gaining popularity for those who enjoy the taste, as I do.

I just find this rhetoric online and dramatization in movies / media to be a great disservice to society. It's such a problem that sobriety is somewhat seen as an off-putting trait by large percentages of populations around the world. 

James Bond would not win millions against the world's best poker players, live through a car chase, and then shoot the bad guy between his eyes after 4 hard drinks. Vistiting Germany does not mean everyone is constantly sloshing foam out of a giant glass while having a great time and encouraging you to partake (in fact, they have puke sinks for Oktoberfest and are working toward reducing consumption). 

Sorry for the rant, summer and holidays are the most tempting for me because alcohol is so imbedded with these seasons.

We had been together for 10 years. In the early days she would be amused by my drinking - “drunkie” she would say with a smile. Then after took my alcoholism as a matter of fact “He likes to drink.” A few years later there was concern in her voice, but she would insist “I don’t think you’re an alcoholic or anything…” I kept silent because deep down, I knew I was. I was hiding the true extent of my drinking from her. She caught me a few times, but just brushed it aside.

6 months ago, I told her I’m quitting. She was supportive. I was 1 month sober. Then relapsed. She did not know.

I was drinking _around_ her. She noticed something was up, but never concluded. She’s say, “You’re weird tonight” or “You’re acting like a drunk person, did you drink today?” I said no, and she believed me.

Last week, the ruse was up. She caught me. I said for the first time to her, **”I’m sorry. I am an alcoholic.”**

It’s been 7 full days. So far so smooth… but I’d like to share this insight. The reason I did not tell her about my relapse, that I hid the drinking from her, was not because I was embarrassed or ashamed. **It was because I wanted to keep drinking.** I did not want to stop, even though I had committed to this person I’m sharing my home that I would. I was bound to be caught, but I intentionally kept it going for as long as I could.

Alcoholism really does delude the mind. Making us do irrational things. 

Now that the ruse is up, I have been able to speak openly to her. When my alcoholism started. How cravings feel like. My weaknesses and triggers. So now my access to booze is even more restricted (thank God) but ironically, I feel more relieved, more free, more at peace.

Thanks for reading.

TLDR: I’ve been hiding my alcoholism from my enabler so that I can keep drinking. But when I was finally found out, I somehow feel more free and at peace.",40

I have a great life and shouldn’t let myself get down like this. I’ve never had a sober birthday/ thanksgiving. Also going on a little vacation with some friends and family this Friday, almost all of them drink. That’s okay though, they aren’t crazy like me. I don’t have any motivation to do any of it right now. I was so excited for all of this, but now with the date being so close I’m just sad and depressed about it. The next 4 days are going to be tough, I’m sure I’ll make the best of it. Just wanted to reach out to you all. Thanks for any support or kind words. Just throwing a pity party that’s all.

Sorry if it becomes a garbled mess, have trouble thinking clearly when I need to express myself lol..

Basically started drinking around 10 years ago, as my social life declined the alcohol intake increased over time. Quit my retail job of 12 years last year due to declining mental health, that job was hell, extremely stressful and a toxic work environment that I still have nightmares about a year and a half later. I'd always drink to get drunk after every shift, stay up late playing online games or binge watching random youtube videos, make an ass of myself on discord trying to be social thanks to 'liquid courage' and then spend my days off in a zombie like state, too fatigued to do anything and full of regret from the night before.  


I'd like to say things improved after leaving my job(I did go from 1-3 hours sleep to around 3-5 hours sleep however, not great but an improvement!), but my drinking habits actually worsened. I get stressed way too easily now, will often drink at night to cope. If I had a good day, productive, exercised and ate well, I'd reward myself by drinking too. The nights would start out great, until they weren't, then find myself laying on the floor drunk crying at 2am wondering why I'm still alive.  


Although I'm feeling very lost and unsure of what to do with my life, I do know that I need to say goodbye to alcohol, the bottle was never my friend. So here's to day one of sobriety.

Prior to that I had quit for the span of four months just a year earlier. Now it has been four months of drinking and reckless decisions and conversations but four months ago I had 9 months of sobriety on my belt. I always try to convince myself I am able to drink like normal people but time and time again I prove myself wrong. 
    I remember thinking later into the 9 months I spe t sober that it had been at least 3 months since I cried or really felt down on my luck. I was talking so much about how I adored this new sober me... and now I'm back to this version of myself I hate.  
     More-so than dumb actions when I'm drinking I say the weirdest and most unfiltered things to people. I go on a tangent about things in people's lives they don't want to talk about and things I definitely don't want to talk about myself and I wake up with a pit in my stomach. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that if I continue this path I will end my life short and devastate people who actually care about me. I cannot live this way any more... I just can't. I don't want to be sad anymore. I want to live and love and be someone I'm proud of and today I just don't like anything about myself if I'm honest.

Although it's not all bad news. I'm sober and I can mope tonight and then grind tomorrow.  I had a similar experience back at the end of October with interviewing. Likewise, didn't get that job I wanted after brutal interviews and that sent off the deep end and back into a bottle of bourbon. Not this time though. I picked up a case of my favourite sparkling water and am going for a walk in my neighbourhood. 

I know most people post about great stuff happening to them here. You know: new jobs, losing weight, gym gains, cool stuff they bought with the money they saved and whatever else. But being sober isn't all sunshine and daisies. There are shitty times too. But even this beats the headaches, shakes, sweats and panic attacks that had become my norm. Don't let a setback be an excuse to pick up the bottle again.

You drink all night to numb the pain
To make it disappear.
You drink to dull yourself 
To make your fears appear less near.
You drink to ""relax"" and ""chill""
To become the person you think you want to be.
You drink to try and find yourself
But all you find is me.
You drink to try and run away
From regrets deep in the past.
To make ""new memories"" with friends 
Life of the party, such a blast.
You drink to fast forward the day
And hope the tape will stop.
You drink until you're over.
You will drink until you drop.

Life is tough and I'm still not where I wanna be, but removing alcohol didn't make my life worse. It just made the problems that were there all along more visible and easier to work on. That's a huge thing. I'm no longer numbing myself and I can more clearly determine where certain emotions are coming from and what to do about them.

Not drinking stopped feeling like a big deal after a few weeks. I would rewatch Annie Grace videos and read this subreddit a lot in the early weeks to stay on track. Now, I barely think about sobriety. I feel like I'm making alcohol irrelevant :). And that feels especially good since I'm often surrounded by it in social situations and I haven't felt tempted to cave in. I'm learning to be more comfortable in social situations. I feel social awkwardness and discomfort more often without alcohol in my system, but I've noticed that my wit and charm are sharper sober. I love watching football and I'm more observant of the alignments and schemes happening in games.

I still frequent the corner store, but now I'm buying CBD drinks to unwind.

Being more aware all the time cam be scary, but I know this is the right path for me to be my best self.

I ran to the fire,

But it did not set me free,
I turned to the bottle,
""Alcohol cure me,
Let me sleep without dreaming"",

1) killed any good gut bacteria I had. Constant diarrhea, sometimes not making it. Unable to digest “normal” food, especially fruits and vegetables. 

2) gave me fine tremors which made it hard to do many tasks, especially hobbies like art

3) made me throw up old blood

4) gives me a false inflated sense of self; the things I said or did under the influence were not cute or becoming. 

5) made my depression and anxiety unbearable; sent me into mixed and seemingly unending manic depressive episodes

6) made no amount of sleep ever feel like enough; never feeling “awake” until the late afternoon

7) kills my skin and makes me look grey; So many more visible wrinkles, rashes, hair loss. 

8) hurt many relationships 

9) killed my sex drive but also put me in some risky situations

10) did not once ever have me saying, “I’m so glad I drank last night”

She only had a few drinks, which would have been me before, and I would have thought that I was perfectly fine in that dinner, but watching her become more and more tipsy you could just see how much even a little bit of alcohol affects people. The more she drank the more passionate she became about mundane things, the more sloppy she became, and the more she just devolved as the dinner the progressed. I am pretty sure she took an edible before the dinner, so this may be more of an explanation as to why things were devolving, but again that would have been me too.

2021-11-24 14:11:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r1cpyw/days_away_from_one_year/,Days away from One Year,"Hi all -- I am usually a lurker when it comes to Reddit, only occasionally posting or commenting on things. For some background, I am a male, 25yrs old, and 1 week away from being 1 year sober. During the latter half of my college years, I started drinking heavily and eventually daily, drinking pretty much nonstop for 2 years post graduation. Covid definitely didn't help, as I'd come home from work and have 5-7 mixed drinks every night, and I'd go to start my mornings by throwing up, going to work hungover and riddled with anxiety. Every weekend I'd be drinking from when I woke up to when I ""went to sleep"" (passed out). Over the course of these drinking years I went from 190lbs to 280lbs (6ft tall for reference). When I looked in the mirror I didn't even recognize who I was anymore. I truly lost my identity, and I hated how my mental state was during these years. 

The morning I finally decided to quit -- I was crying on my way to work. I knew I needed to make a change in my life, and that I couldn't continue to keep drinking. Something that my father said a long time ago popped into my head, and it was something that his grandfather would always say. ""The one constant thing in this life is change"". It hit me like a ton of bricks and I couldn't stop crying. I knew that for the past few years I had been fighting against the changes of the world, of my family, of my life. The loss of family members and friends, other fears/feelings/problems I had,  I dealt with by numbing my mind with alcohol. 

During this past year I have learned a lot about myself. I have an incredibly addictive personality (due in part by my ADHD?), and I need to be mindful of what things I should steer clear of, and who I should spend my time with. I am back down to 210lbs, (I have a little bit more weight to drop) and I can honestly say my mental state is leagues ahead of where I was before. 

As I near the 1 year mark, I am getting more anxious. It makes me think of what I have accomplished, and of who I am now. Do I still get the urges to drink sometimes? Of course I do! Do I think I'll be as bad of a drinker if I go back? Do I want to go back to drinking? Now that is the true question I need to answer. I believe that if I did go back to drinking that I could keep myself in check as I have seen the root problems of why I drank in the first place -- but at the same time I am trapped in the worry that I'll be that same person I was a year ago. 

To be honest I am not all too sure why I am writing all of this. I am not sure if I am just looking to write how I'm feeling, or if I'm looking for a fellow sober person who has struggled with alcoholism to knock some sense into me/ encourage me. I think ultimately I just need to remind myself to not worry about the years to come, but to worry about the current day I am living in. I know that is said a lot, and its one thing to hear a mantra, and another to actually meditate on it and live through it. 

So my friends, today IWND -- WYNDT ?",8

More and more new research is coming out showing taking or micro dosing chemicals like DMT, LSD, and psilocybin (mushrooms) can cure mental disorders. From alcoholism to depression, heroin addiction to anorexia. It seems like the more research that is done the more promising it may be that in the relatively near future, there may be an actual cure for addiction and the various mental disorders related to or causing it.

Has anyone had experience with any of these chemicals? Please let me know how they effected your overall habits and emotions long term.

Just curious because I hate to get my hopes up, but nothing else has seemed to work.

I find your posts and vulnerability inspiring so I thought I'd give it a go myself. Since college, I've partaken in binge drinking and found it got much worse the year after I graduated college and after my Grandma's unexpected and tragic death. Although that was almost 7 years ago, I feel like the culture we/I live in has socially accepted binge drinking and I can accurately reflect on the fact that I've dealt with my emotional problems through binge drinking and smoking weed as a means of escapism. My family has expressed their concern but I don't feel like I've faced any severe consequences outside of a few failed (but doomed) relationships and friendships. Maybe I'd  consider myself a 'high-functioning' alcoholic by way of holding a stable job and relationship, albeit problems have arisen. In the past year,  I have found 'excuses' for drinking wine before 11am, buying a pocket size vodka bottle to finish as I respond to emails, easily finishing 2 bottles of wine a day and am now denying my drinking to my partner out of embarrassment. In the past 3 years,  I've acted out in ways that have severely hurt my closest relationships and as hard as I try, I'm constantly on the hunt to try and numb the pain. I am taking Lexapro and Xanax to work through my emotional pain but whenever I find myself in the throws of an anxiety attack, I take half a .25 xanax and immediately find I'm craving alcohol or smoking a cigarette to increase the numbness. I'm going to my first AA meeting tomorrow and hope to find some people to relate to. I know I'm heading down a dark path but I still keep trailing ahead, guns blazing.

It’s just occurred to me that this time last year I would have had a pretty packed December lined up, and this year I’ve only got a couple of social things in my diary.
 
It’s not that I won’t be socialising at all. Friends have been great about supporting me during my sober journey this year.  But I guess I’m being missed off the invites where heavy drinking is being planned this festive season (ie most of them). Not that I want to go on a pub crawl - I’ve found spending too much time with drunk people has limited appeal when you are sober.  I guess I just feel a little deflated - is this the way it will be now?

This will be my first sober Christmas in decades. I did actually spend New Years Eve sober last year, after over indulging all through December. I’m so glad that I’m not even a little tempted to go back to those bad old days. 

But I was wondering if there are any more experienced sobernauts out there with advice for how to make the most of being sober during the Christmas party season?

I have not ruined my life (yet), but I see where it goes. I can still drink and live my life and do all my obligations even be relatively successful, but it is more complex and challenging every day. And I can see that I am wasting a lot of my potential. Thinks got even worse since I quit the corporate job a year ago and started my own company. I can now simply decide that I will drink like mad on Monday evening or any other workday and not go to the office tomorrow morning. I will call in guys to tell them that I have some meetings in town and meet them tomorrow. I believe they know or suspect what is going on. From a weekend drinker and maybe once per workdays I become there or even four times per week drinker. 

People notice how much I can drink, and I mean - I can really drink a lot. Almost every time I drink, I hear a comment tomorrow ""man, you can really drink. I thought that I could drink a lot, and I was known between my friends as a guy who can drink, but you are easily killing me"". I know only one guy who can follow me. ONE from the all people I met in the last 10 years. Crazy! 

So yesterday I decided that I would sit alone in a bar and have three drinks before meeting my friends. And even that did not help me; I again was the drunkest, shittest guy, who had the most drinks. And, of course, I did not go to work today. 

And that really hit me today. I was drinking in parallel not to be noticed how much I can drink. An unfortunate situation actually.

Getting and staying sober has allowed me to build a life that is beyond anything I could have possibly imagined. Here are my three main takeaways:

1. Stay humble: There is nothing special about me and other people are not really thinking about me when they do things. I am a person among people; a worker among workers; not some snowflake that deserves special dispensation in situations. I am neither the best nor the worst. I just am.
2. Be honest: with myself and those around me. Not only about ""what happened"" but also about what I like and don't like, my needs, my boundaries, etc.
3. Have integrity: if my thoughts, words, and actions all align then it is far less likely I will hate myself or beat myself up about something. The only thing I *have* to do is the Next Right Thing, whether I think someone is watching or not.

Be safe out there and no matter what happens don't get loaded! Happy Thanksgiving to those in the U.S.

I posted after I had my last beer on Thursday morning and the responses were so incredibly supportive, empowering, and helpful. I want to stay active here with you all. 

Day 6, wow. Many people in my life don't understand why this is a big deal to me. They can't comprehend why it's so hard to get this far and why I can't just have ""better self control"". I haven't been sober for 6 days in almost two years, the only time I've gone without drinking for 24 hours was when it's totally forced. I'm talking jail or in the hospital. Any other situation I've been in where I shouldn't be drinking, I was.

I went through minor withdrawal symptoms but amazingly not as bad as I thought. I still have pretty bad insomnia but the shakes, headaches, and nausea are gone. 

The cravings are not. I couldn't even go into the grocery store last night to get Thanksgiving meal ingredients because I knew I'd have to pass up the beer section. My tire had been flat for the past few days and I honestly didn't want to fix it because I knew it'd be so easy to go on my regular morning liquor store run. 

Even the fact that I would go every day and spend way more money on shooters or gas station tall cans, instead of buying cases or bottles, is so ridiculous to me. If I bought a 12 pack they'd be gone by afternoon, so instead my weird brain decided making multiple trips for tall boys (drinking the same amount, but spending more) somehow was better.

Anyway thanks to this sub I have somewhere to be when I'm feeling weak or alone. I also found out about the I Am Sober app, and The Naked Mind, here. Both have been immensely helpful.

Anyway, thank you all for being here and making this community what it is.",10

My MIL called to check in on us before the holiday. Today is my day 4 after a really traumatic event this past Saturday where I blacked out and was abusive towards my husband, in front of my kids. She excitedly told me she made the Sangria I asked for.  As soon as she mentioned it I wanted to burst into tears.

My husband will be drinking with his family this Thursday and I’m expected to sit it out. I WANT to sit it out, but I can’t believe how alone it makes me feel right now. 

I really don’t want to relapse tomorrow, and I’m just really sad I’m even in this place. I’ve enjoyed this Sangria for 15 years with his family this time of year. Many of them responsibly? But his family are huge drinkers. 

I guess I just needed a safe space to ask how to deal with it.

You can do this!,"I spent a decade telling myself that I wasn't an alcoholic. I still had a job, a couple of nice cars, a wife, and a house. I thought because I could ""take a month off"" of drinking, that I could control it.

I would justify my drinking, ""I don't drink everyday!"" Then I did. ""I don't drink in the mornings."" Then I did. ""I don't shake in the mornings."" Then I did. ""I've never gotten in legal trouble!"" Then I did... You get the picture.

By the time that I accepted the fact that I was an alcoholic, I was physically addicted to alcohol (at age 33). I could not, NOT drink. Now I know, alcoholism is a progressive, deadly disease.

On Thanksgiving day, 2016, I had two options, get help, or die a miserable, lonely death. I was sick and tired of being, sick and tired. I was hitting bottom faster than I could lower my standards.

Today, I know that I am an alcoholic because, despite all of the misery that alcohol has caused me, if I do not work on myself on a daily basis, one day my brain will convince me that a drink sounds like a  good idea. Despite everything my brain will lie and say ""It wasn't that bad!"" or ""I can control this.""

If I ever want to lose everything, all I have to do is take one sip.

Sure, I was taking aspirin every night before bed to stave off the inevitable hangover; sure, I was having my bedtime determined by trying to be asleep before the spins kick in; sure, I was secretly refilling the liquor bottles to hide how quickly they were emptied -- but it's not affecting my life, so that's just a bad habit I need to tamp down on. Not a bfd. 

That's a lie, I knew it was a big deal. 

Every night I'd tell myself I'd moderate. ""Only one drink, *maybe* two, but that's it!"" And every night I'd fail. ""Okay, FINE, I'll just have to quit drinking entirely for a while. Just for a little while, as a reset!"" But I kept coming up with excuses why it wasn't a good time. Can't spoil the fun of a vacation, can't refuse to have a couple drinks with a friend from out of town, can't this, can't that. 

I decided that after I got back from what was sure to be a miserable trip back to visit family for the holidays, I'd stop drinking -- for real this time! 

The flight in, I'd been upgraded, and took FULL advantage of the free liquor (on top of the mini bottles I drank at the airport). Every time I was offered a beverage, I asked for vodka. Every time I asked for one, the flight attendant gave me two. By the time I deboarded, I was absolutely trashed. I immediately stumbled my way into a bathroom to throw up, then called my mom to let her know the situation -- I was just barely alert enough to know how irresponsible it was for a young woman traveling alone to put herself in this position.

When I woke up in my hotel the next morning, it was clear I could not longer lie to myself about my drinking being nbd. I couldn't afford to put off sobriety until a convenient stopping point. I told my mom and other family I'm quitting drinking and why. They knew I drank too much, but couldn't believe how bad it had gotten. I was ashamed and humiliated -- but determined. 

I am on day 6 (with another three high-stress days before I go home), having previously tried and failed to complete a full single day without drinking in a long, long time. Looking forward to celebrating a full week soon, and IWNDWYD.",413

Family, house, jobs, thanksgiving plans, and children.  All because of a decision 10 years ago.  I'm going to celebrate by playing a LOT of diablo 2.

I have one takeaway for everyone from my experience for anyone new, or thinking about quitting.  You'll see tons of posts on here, and from other people, about how their life changed instantly and is now all rainbows and magic.  ""I lost 30lbs!"", ""I feel amazing every morning!"", ""I'm so much happier!"", ""best shape of my life!"", ""I feel so much more stable."" etc etc

It's not all rainbows.  There will be shitty moments.  It's not magic, you're life will not instantly become better.  You have to put in other work besides not drinking.  Don't be deterred because you're not feeling ELATED from stopping.  It's just a base foundation for changing your life.  You will almost certainly uncover some deep down stuff that you were self medicating against by drinking that you will face, or are now facing.  Keep plugging through it.  Seek help from therapy and doctors if you need it.  I promise it's worth it.

I’ve noticed that while my mood is definitely more stable and better. I have far less patience for situations I don’t want to be involved with and for people I don’t typically want to interact with. 

For example, when I was drinking. I would be more willing to tolerate someone I either found phony, sleazy or less than desirable to hang with and even be phony back to tolerate them. (The sleazy, obnoxious friend of a friend, the phony acquaintance you know is phony, etc etc) Or I would put myself in a situation that I knew would either bore me to tears or derail my plans but would tolerate it. (Example, endlessly sitting in a social situation with a spouses friends that you know bore you to tears past the point of your social battery etc etc) Even when I was not actively drinking. 

I guess the reason I bring it up is because I’ve noticed in myself with a lot of these things, I’ve begun not compromising regardless of whether it makes me look less than agreeable. Sometimes I even come across as a dick because of it.. 

Maybe I’ve been subconsciously happier because I’m not compromising ? Maybe without the bottle in front of me to lobotomize myself it’s just become too unbearable to stand? I still feel very live and let live and social. I’m definitely an easy going extrovert at heart. But becoming more and more conscious of my “social battery and tolerances”

This post is based on something that I got out of a conversation I had with a couple of guys I know who have been sober for multiple decades, and who also have a quality of sobriety that I admire. (Much of what I say on SD is based on things that I've gleaned over the years from kicking around on here and in AA, which is a good thing - if I had any idea what I was talking about I wouldn't be counting days again. But I've picked up some useful stuff along the way.)

Anyway, what these guys were saying is that drinking was about trying to have control, and sobriety is about losing it. Which caught me off guard, because that's the exact opposite of what I instinctively think of when I think about drinking and control. 

When I drank I *lost* control, and sometimes that was even on purpose. Particularly when I was younger, drinking gave me the ability and an excuse to act like a maniac, and sometimes that was fun. It's not how I want to live my life now and it's definitely not something that I could go back to, drinking stopped being a party for me a *looong* time ago, but it was what it was.

But their point was that drinking is actually about trying to control how we feel. The purpose of drinking is to control our feelings and our experience of the world. And yeah, that's literally exactly why I drank. I drank to change how I felt, which means that I was trying to control my feelings. Drinking really was a desperate attempt to gain control.

Another point that one of them made is that the purpose of isolating is control. I'm a big isolator, so that has resonance for me. And it checks out. I withdraw from people to avoid being hurt, essentially. It's basically a response to the reality that I can't control other people. I assume that I'm either going to let people down, or they're going to hurt me, and as a preemptive strike I isolate. It's just easier to shut myself off than it is to navigate relationships where people (including me) have wants and needs and feelings. 

Since I can't control what other people do or how other people feel or how *I* feel, I isolate in order to maintain control. Relationships are outside of my control and what is outside of my control might hurt me, so isolating is the only way to control the uncontrollable. Which explains why I'm the least likely to reach out to people when I need support the most, because that's when I'm also at my most vulnerable. This is more of a therapy thing, but isolating is not uncommon among people who have problems with alcohol, so I'll leave it here.

Anyway, recovery is about giving up control because recovery is about accepting life as it is and learning to live in the present moment, in reality. Recovery is about letting go of the desire to control people, places, and situations, and focusing on what I actually *do* have the power to control, which is my own attitudes and behaviors. 

This might be more of an AA perspective than something that is generally common in recovery, I don't know, but I found it really interesting. Because that's what I struggle with more than anything. I want to avoid being present in my current reality by focusing on what's going on in my head, which is usually either ruminating about the past, or focusing on fantasies/plans about the future. It just is what it is, but it's a coping mechanism that no longer serves me. 

Right now is where real life is happening, but being part of real life means giving up control, because real life just laughs and laughs at me when I try to control things.

Anyway, that's what I'm mulling over at this exact moment in time. Much love to all the sobernauts here with me on my journey.

A little background about me. I’m a college senior, and I only recently started drinking this year when I turned 21.

This is the thing, I always feel so nauseous in the morning and just crappy. I don’t sleep well.

I’ll try to keep this short. I’ve been struggling with depression for about 10 years now and started self-medicating with alcohol about 7 years ago. It got bad a couple years in when I started drinking every day. Eventually it became where my body was dependent and I needed to drink all day every day just to function. I’ve tried to stop a handful of times but this time I’m trying my absolute best to take it more seriously. My other attempts to quit resulted in two withdrawal-seizures, hospitalizations, and close brushes with death. It’s quite literally my life on the line here, not to mention all the people close to me who I have hurt.
Now to the issue at hand. I’m an atheist in AA. I was raised Presbyterian but I’ve considered myself an atheist since I was 12. I’m trying my best to be open-minded here but I’m getting tired of trying. I go to a meeting once a day and hearing (non-verbatim) “you can’t achieve success without a close relationship with your higher power” is getting old. I’ve heard all the work-arounds, trust me. I even work with a sponsor (I’m on step 8 but haven’t started the amendments) and we decided my higher power should just be the sober community at large, but it’s not really working for me. I had to leave a meeting early last night because the topic was “faith” and I just couldn’t relate. I came really close to stopping by a liquor store on the way home but I’m glad I didn’t.
I just feel like there’s got to be a way for an atheist to control his addiction to alcohol without succumbing to others’ belief systems. I would love some advice on how to handle my situation. Should I move to something more therapy-based like SMART recovery?
I’m posting this here instead of a sub that corresponds more directly with AA because I would like advice from non-biased people who are just trying to stop or moderate drinking. I hope I’ve said enough to give y’all a glimpse into my situation and I really appreciate it in advance.",9

I don’t consider myself an alcoholic but who knows? Maybe. I just know it’s time to stop. I am in my mid 60’s, relatively fit and healthy but the last two years have fueled wine drinking. Between the death of a dear friend, and my 14 year old dog, covid, panic attacks, etc (that was 2020) and this year my husband lost his best friend, we lost another friend and then his cousin, none to covid. With those events I gave myself permission to have a few wines before lunch, and then my usual 3 to 4 (4 oz pours - yes I measure 🤓) in the evening. 

My sleep is disrupted and it’s expensive! I need to preserver my brain cells! So I will tube in here and gather inspiration from this community. 

Last night I had one 4 oz pour. Gonna do that for a week. The following week, 1 2oz. The following week, zero. And yea, I might be crazy for doing this during the holidays but really there’s always an excuse so now is the time. 

 Thanks for reading.",23

I was a vodka guy. The 12$ McCormick plastic jugs did the trick on a dime. It also turned me into a monster. Alcohol was the vehicle I used to drive myself into homelessness. Alcohol cost me jobs. For years I couch hopped, from 16 to 23, I never had a permanent home. Nor a real relationship. My first marriage was a sham resulting from a pregnancy and alcohol cost me custody of the kid. That should have been all the inspiration I needed but I was lost. You make these dumb justifications about what will fix your life and somehow quitting alcohol is never on that list. Our marriage turned to shit and we divorced soon. It was back to couch hopping.  

It took three more years and my second son being born before I was strong enough to quit. Two months of watching him while mommy worked and I hated myself. I was having to take shots in the bathroom to stop my hands from shaking just so I could hold him. It was hell, the dt’s and the relentless nausea, the clammy hands, not to mention I was running out of friends fast, burning bridges to excuse why I was drunk all day every day.

One day I got sick of it, I wanted to be a dad. So I stopped. And that was hell too but I made it through.

I got a crap job and put all my heart into my getting my oldest kid back and I did get partial custody and we now have a close relationship. I started a company. Eventually it took off enough I could quit but I was still depressed and still anxious and still a raging mess of emotions.


So, I started smoking. I know it isn’t ideal. I know I should be happy naturally but I’m not. I had been bouncing between Zoloft, and Paxil, and Lexapro but I never found my answer. I thought I hated weed because every time I smoked, I was drunk and that’s a terrible feeling.

Now I got two little boys with a pothead dad (I keep it in my office and they think it’s a e-cigarette. I know they’ll figure it out eventually but until they’re old enough to not be narcs, it’s best they don’t know) who loves road trips and board games, not a dad who drinks and yells and can’t drive them to school.

Im nervous posting this because I don’t know how this group views weed. I know it’s an addiction for me. Im also addicted to sugar, reddit, and believe it or not, sucking my thumb. But this addiction, when monitored and combined with antidepressants, has helped me progress in life towards being a better father, husband, son (my mother used to be anti pot, very conservative Baptist. Now she believes very much in the medical benefits.), and just better towards myself.

I may not be sober in the literal definition but I haven’t been to jail in six years, I haven’t stormed out, or gotten fired, or tried to hurt myself. And for me and everybody in my life, that’s cause for celebration.

Edit: you guys are awesome and I’m glad I shared with y’all. Thank y’all for being a great community.",657
2021-11-24 07:28:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r143k0/what_makes_me_so_special/,What makes me so special?,"Yesterday I woke up with such a strong conviction to stay sober for just those 24 hours. I made a to-do list at work, applied for school through a tuition reimbursement through my employer, hit up an old AA sponsor to see if he wanted to hit a meeting, went to a sober (but not in recovery, just a lucky normie) friend's house for a few hours immediately after work so I wouldn't be alone, came home and cleaned my apartment.

If I was doing all this stuff in like the 17 hours I was awake yesterday, I figured I'd be satisfied with my efforts and not find the need to drink. The moment I finally sat on the couch, took my nighttime sleep/mood med (remeron), and went to find some music on spotify. I looked at the time. 10:45pm. Liquor store closes at 11.

I don't even know what happened. I was on the phone with my lady in one hand, telling her all about how hard this was but that I felt strong enough to do it without medical intervention, with a 12er of old style in the other. I was home by 10:52. I drank 6 before the sleeping pill kicked in and I got a typical 4 hours of awful sleep. I live 50 ft from a liqour store.... fuck. 

I've been to rehab a million times. Detox. Halfway houses. 3/4 houses. ""...constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. They are not at fault. They seem to have been born that way."" (I might have flubbed the quote; I'm going off memory) that line in chapter 5 of the AA book always stood out to me. I don't know if I've just convinced myself that I'm so up my own ass that I will never be able to think I can't just do this my way. I've shown myself the exact opposite. Most of the experiences I've had since adolescence have been steeped in self inflicted tragedy and heartbreak as I watched my elderly parents come to accept that there's nothing *they* can do to save their baby boy.

I want this so badly. I've tried for 16 years. I've managed to not be on like 7 different intoxicants 24/7, so this 8 month relapse has still left me with enough wherewithal to be independent/make it to work. I'm super grateful for that and I should give myself a modicum of credit, but the manifestation of the bigger issue is still there, and in no way am I trying to minimize or justify.

I'm just trying to have what I say and what I do be the same thing. That's all I can ask for, really. Sobriety has been the only non-fraudulent state of existence I've ever experienced. Why is this so hard to get? I used to think I wasn't a selfish person because I thought pretty lowly of myself, but even in this pity party post, it's apparent that all I'm doing is thinking about myself. That's gotta be selfish, too.

Here's to another day of trying. I won't give up. Thanks for reading. Grateful for this group and the safe space it provides. I hope each of you find it within yourself to act bravely and beautifully today.",7

I've been an alcoholic since I was 25, I've quit several times. I recently lost my best friend to a car crash and I started back binge drinking in early September. I've maybe had 10 days between then and now sober, and when I do, my blood pressure goes to about 180/120 and my heart rate around 160. I have two local hospitals, I've been to each, to the ER. They just don't care once I tell them I'm an alcoholic going through withdrawals. They level off my blood pressure and heart rate, release, and tell me I should find a place to rehab. My insurance does not cover rehab and I don't have a spare $5000 just standing by and quit my job to go off and do it. Plus the only place local to me doesn't even do medical assisted rehab, they just monitor you as you go cold turkey. So, what if I have a seizure? The DTs? I have had seizures in the past from alcohol withdrawal, but I was just at home, passed out, and made it out alive somehow. I've talked with several psychs in my area and none are willing to deal with my situation and they all refer me to that one rehab place that I can't afford.   


I don't understand why no one is willing to help me. I'm going to die and they just don't care. I'm asking for help, reaching out for help, and they just turn me away. I feel as if I'm close to the end, and I don't want to die. I know I put myself in this situation, and I know I did this to myself, but I really want to stop, I really need help. I can barely function, my life revolves around alcohol. I've been through 5 general practice doctors, and NONE help. They just refer me to AA, which does nothing to help me detox.   


I don't know what else to do. And yes, I know, none of you are doctors, you can't blah blah blah....... I just want some advice, ideas, tips, ANYTHING. My only options right now are to find 5 grand, go to rehab, where I'll be put in a bed and forced to go cold turkey, and if I start to die, maybe they'll send me to the hospital, which all ready turned me away. Or stay at home and go cold turkey and if I die, I die. This state is pure shit. They care so much about unborn babies, but don't give a fuck about actual living people. I'm so done. Why isn't anyone willing to help me? Isn't that what doctors are supposed to do???",31

My spouse and I were at our neighbors’ for board game night, and they know we don't drink. The husband has stopped drinking too and has their fridge stocked with different NA beers. 

It scared me, and it was something that I argued with my first recovery program sponsor about…”I can drink NA beer. I’m fine. It doesn’t trigger me.”  Tonight I heard someone say that her sponsor once suggested she pray to combat the urge to drink, and she thought ""it might work but I didn’t want to give it a chance."" 

I’m the type of alcoholic who likes to get lost. Get lost in a dive bar where I don’t know anyone and leave with 5 new “friends.” Then, (because of lots of brain training) instead of going down that negative spiral, I thought “what a miracle that we are all present, on purpose, when we could be in some dank, dark hole in the wall…just lost.”

I don't know if it was that it tasted like dive bars and regrets, and that I never sipped Pabst for the taste (like I did *some* craft beers). Or if it’s the holidays and people are dropping like flies all around me, but I decided to do what you you guys taught me and tell on myself. I talked about it with other former drunks and messaged my recovery sponsor too. 

I’m fucking allergic to booze. It’s strange that it didn’t bother me all the other times I’ve had any NA beer, but this time I felt weird and I’ll listen to that voice inside. Also, how many times did I drink alcohol until I crossed the line? Trick question: I’ll never know. I’m not sure that I should chance playing that game again. Other truly alcohol-free drinks taste better, anyway.

TL;DR—I’m allergic and NA PBR tastes too much like my past, does contain alcohol and is not to be trifled with for this alcoholic. Figuring it out 17 months into sobriety is still soon enough!",6

I'm the one who posted about turning up to an online class wasted and feeling absolutely mortified.

My class is back on tomorrow and I'm getting a little anxious now. I think it's the plaster that needs ripping off but I honestly cannot remember a lot of the class last week and it scares me.

It's a night class for Japanese so I think at one point I talked about my favourite Japanese bands (cringe), then when in a breakout room I was with someone who was embroiled in a row in the group chat the week before with someone who was being an idiot so I think I said about how I agreed with them. 

I also remember the teacher saying in front of everyone that she thought I was drunk. I dont remember much else...

Since then I've apologised to the teacher which she accepted.

My friend who I've known since I was 7 is also in this class which makes it worse. We had a couple of whatsapp messages after the class which I honestly dont remember but she didnt sound annoyed (which I guess is something?). 

She just congratulated me on my news which I dont remember sharing. The only thing I can think of that I must had said was that I was moving house which I had been keeping quiet.

Usually when I'm drunk I dont tend to get nasty, but quite chatty (read: very annoying) and very embarrassing.

Some times it’s bad sometimes I have it pretty under control down to only a few beers a night. The more free time I have the worse it gets. When I’m constantly busy I only have a few beers at the house after work but when I have a couple days off and no plans I end up drinking hard liquor most of the day by myself sometimes starting as soon as I wake up and have a tendency to start doing coke if I can find it so I can drink even more. Usually when these episodes happen I’m by myself or with other friends with similar issues so not many people know how bad my problem is. I occasionally black out when I’m out in publicwith friends and tend to make a fool of myself from time to time but not on the same level as when I’m home and know I can get away with it. Known I’ve had a problem for years but usually managed it okay for the most part and been able to hide it from most people and always just thought I was young and would grow out of it but it seems to gradually be getting worse, started throwing up bile a couple years ago about ever two or three weeks after benders but recently started throwing up blood after bad benders. I always figured since I could hold a job and my friends were still around it was all good. My older brother is a alcoholic and both my parents had a alcoholic parent so even though they suspect me of being one it’s kind of normalized in the family. I move around a lot for work so i don’t get to serious into dating so even though most girls I date would realize I had a problem and dump me I didn’t care because I was usually not taking it that serious anyways until I met a chick this summer that I really regret loosing. That’s what made me start thinking I might need to do something about my drinking if I want to have a happy life. Since then work has been pretty slow so I’ve had lots free time which has been making me drink a lot more. Went on a bad bender this weekend that made me realize how pathetic my life has become and that I don’t want to keep living this way. Going to tapper back off and try to quit soon. Posting on here because I feel like putting it out there in the world will make me feel more accountable 

Plan on getting back in to working out and reading and possibly journaling to fill up my spare time and any other suggestions are appreciated",9

Long story short I got very drunk Friday and blacked out. First time in almost 2 years I got that drunk. First time I drank at all in two months. I went for dinner started drinking and then the night took off. I was with friends all night dancing and from what I remembered nothing terrible happened. 

Saturday morning I woke up at home. My husband and kids were home with me. I told my husband I wanted to die. He said you always feel this way it’s ok you’ll be ok. When he went to the garage I went to the bathroom and took a handful of blood pressure pills. I did tell him shortly after and my mom came and drove me to the hospital. I got charcoal and some IV meds and was there for 24 hours.

I got some anti-anxiety meds and my doctor started me on nalextrone for alcohol cravings. I don’t even know what to do now. I was barely conscious when I made that decision Saturday morning. I just knew I couldn’t feel two weeks of insane anxiety I feel after drinking. I guess today is day 3. I’m tired now but I’m ok. Really just have to take it one day at a time.",25

The not so good news is I feel pretty empty. It’s a bit hard to celebrate without alcohol or get my happiness above baseline.  I guess it takes longer than 3 months to feel better after quitting alcohol.  I want to feel high, feel good, which so far doesn’t come naturally, even from being offered a better paying job.",14

And then all these people telling this girl to run from the alcoholic even though he'd been sober for a year (the guy had many other issues).

Is there a difference in how recovering alcoholics are viewed vs active alcoholics?

It seems so unfair to have to carry around this burden sometimes. There's someone in leadership at my work who makes a joke about how he drinks so much in every meeting. Why is it ok to joke about drinking but when someone says, yeah I have a problem, all of sudden they are the problem?

Honestly, if non-addicts knew how hard this was, they would stand in awe of those in recovery.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

One of my favorite childhood memories is watching cheesy old monster movies with my mom. She loved them. She was like if Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, got married, changed into mom jeans and an 80's sweater, and then had a couple of kids she had to figure out how to entertain.

One of the movies that I remember watching with her was the 1958 masterpiece, *Monster on the Campus.* Basically, a college professor/scientist brings a prehistoric fish into his lab, and it turns out that anyone or anything that ingests its blood or otherwise gets its blood into their body turns into a gigantic monster and goes on a screaming rampage, as is custom. 

Safety protocols in science be damned, a dog gets some fish juice, a bug gets some fish juice, and our hero, the professor, gets fish juiced on multiple occasions with fairly predictable results involving murder, scared coeds, and a lot of trashed rooms.

The thing that used to make me laugh about that movie is... How hard is it to just *not* ingest prehistoric fish juice especially after you've figured out that it's the fish juice that's turning you into a monster that is wreaking havoc on your community. I mean, the time he washed his cut hand in prehistoric fish juice and the time he (STG) accidentally smoked a pipe laced with prehistoric fish juice could maybe be written off as just unfortunate incidents, but by the end of the movie he's doing it on purpose to himself! Did he ever think of just... Not?

It's sort of less funny once I realized that I, too, have been guilty of intentionally ingesting a rather unappetizing substance that makes me act like a crazy person, but still a 10/10 watch. 

I don't even know if the movie was actually meant to be an allegory about addiction, but it's still one of my favorites.

How about you, seen any movies that really speak to you lately?

2021-11-23 22:45:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r0vjyb/50_hours_in/,50 Hours In,"So, I was going to wait until the morning for another post, but I wanted to journal here my overall Day Two experience. I am now 50 hours out since my last drink and while I woke up feeling BETTER, I was in a brain fog, absolutely cranky, but still able to work through my 9 hour shi(f)t--despite some waves of anxiety. I'll probably discuss my upcoming anxiety in tomorrow's post. 

I realize that during the withdrawal process, and even the process of recovery at this point in general, it's definitely not an on/off switch. I still had some lingering regret from my last bender, but I also realized that the only way to create distance is to not do them again. Don't get me wrong, I have done FAR worse things in the past, but as I am really needing to make this stick, I think forgiveness with myself and from others is to just not fucking do it again. Easier said than done, but the crippling self-loathing after so many broken promises to myself and others is a pretty damn strong incentive. 

I also realized that the majority of the day was not feeling I needed a drink, but an obsession on how NOT to drink. Maybe they are one in the same, who knows. I was more craving the tools I need to stop the madness, than the poison that creates it in the first place today. I think when I framed it that way, I felt much more empowered to take stuff like this sub much more seriously. 

Still a little wonky, but I have been staying hydrated and I finally ate some salmon, then proceeded to eat 3 pretty large chicken salad sandwiches with Doritos for dinner--something that would have been unheard of last week. Being able to spend 15 dollars on two meals for the day versus spending $30 dollars on shitty McDonald's and eating 5 chicken nuggets, leaving it out for two days, and having to throw the rest away is already a solid step in the right direction. My hands are also still a bit shaky, but I hope that subsides soon.

I'm on day 7, for the past 5 years I've been keeping a buzz from the moment I wake up until I get home from work, and then drinking until I fall asleep, wake up, rinse, repeat. Every day for the past 4 years, Ive said ""I'll drink today, and today will be my last day."" I FINALLY broke the cycle.. 

These 7 days so far have been very up and down, but I wanted to offer some insight that may help anyone on their journey, probably common knowledge to those who have been sober for a while, but for anyone newly sober or here because they want to break the cycle, believe me - Alcohol is lying to you. I play competitive soccer, and play twice a week. I'm the goalie and before every game I would sit in the parking lot and take 4 shots of whiskey right before I walked in. I'm a very good goalie, and of course in my alcoholic mind I attributed my skills to the fact that ""I'm drunk so I don't think, I just react and that's why I make so many saves on the field"". 

Anyways, I've played 2 games now with my team SOBER, and the first game I was seriously nervous. Somehow in my mind I had convinced myself that the reason I was good at a sport i've played my whole life is because of alcohol, and being sober I really thought I was suddenly going to suck and let my team down. That was the alcohol lying to me. Two games down, 100% sober and I'm just as good as I was before. I know I'm good because I'm good, NOT because of the alcohol. It's amazing what we think we can't do without it.

Alcohol is a liar. It will tell you life is better with it, that you'll be funnier and more social, that you'll be a loner without it. ALL LIES. Alcohol is the devil on your shoulder. Without it, youre free from the misery of wondering how great life could be.

Don’t neglect healing your brain with the proper vitamins and nutrients in early sobriety, or you might not ever reach the mental clarity necessary to make real change","Chris Scott’s “Drinking Sucks” outlines this in perfect detail. AA never worked for me because I was never in a place physiologically where I had the capability to ingest what I was hearing or implement any kind of “spiritual change”. All I knew was that a drink would make me feel better than anything I’d learn in AA at that point.For me, it was critical to take certain supplements and restore my mental and physical health and natural energy levels before I could even entertain the idea of long term sobriety. That was my missing link. So often in traditional rehab, this basic idea is under addressed, which is why success rates are so low. A healthy brain is step one, and an alcoholic’s brain fresh off of quitting is far from healthy. Do yourself a favor and look into Chris Scott and his book/website. It was a lifesaver for me. There are ways to dramatically reduce PAWS and accelerate your way to freedom in the most comfortable way possible. Just wanted to share that.

I was too ashamed to come back here and start over. I kept drinking. Told myself I'd moderate this time but within days was back to two bottles of wine a night and secret shots at work.   

My friend who works next door to me is sober and encouraged me to just try again for a week. So I tried again. Tonight is 6 days in. Usually when I back out of sobriety, I wait months to years to try again. This time, I got back on within a month. And, once again, my cat is very happy with me. And this time I'm avoiding even restaurants right now...too tempting. 

Here's to starting again! No time spent sober is ever wasted, even if I slipped up before. So thankful for this community 💜

2021-11-23 20:28:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r0suh4/holiday_coming_up_in_the_us_lets_talk_strategy/,"Holiday coming up in the US, let's talk strategy!","Whether you are newly sober, sober curious, or haven't touched a drink in years, one thing that we can all count on during the holiday season is a tone-deaf friend or relative that, upon noticing you not drinking, will probe you like an alien with a fresh-caught Midwesterner until you reveal your reasons for being sober. 

This post is to remind everyone (and mostly myself) that your sobriety is your own! Guard it! Say only what you want to say about it! Focus on staying sober and having a good time connecting with the people you actually like. Don't waste too much time stressing about what people think of your sobriety, they can eat a dick if they are being anything less than supportive!

I've come up with some things to say if you are offered a drink. Lies are always ok if it keeps you sober but I've stuck to things that are true or at least truth-adjacent: 

1. ""I've already got one, thanks!"" (Always have an NA option on hand!)

2. ""No."" (Just say it! It's liberating! No is a valid response to this question and you don't need to say more) 

3. ""I'm on a cleanse"" (sobriety is cleansing your life of a literal poison, so this is true! They might have follow-up questions if they see you shotgunning a pumpkin pie in the kitchen later but who cares!) 

4. ""I'm doing sober November!"" (For some reason people seem totally ok with their friends/relatives doing month long breaks from booze but the second you say you are sober all of a sudden they are a fucking addiction specialist that is just dying to tell you ""you don't actually have a problem"". In sobriety every month can be a sober month!) 

5. ""Drinking gives me uncontrollable diarrhea"" (I'd suggest saving this one for the person who WONT LET IT GO when they hear you are not drinking. Direct and unwavering eye contact is a must. This also was mostly true for me while I was drinking so it's not even really a lie) 

6. ""I don't like drinking anymore"" (no need to explain further if you don't want to. Even if you still crave alcohol, I doubt you like the effects drinking it has on your life, otherwise you'd still be drinking) 

7. ""I have a drinking problem and am sober now"" (not for everyone, but letting the people close to you know that your sobriety is VERY important to you can keep them from ever offering you booze in the future. If the idea of announcing it stresses you out, don't do it! If you want only one or two people to know, only tell them! It's up to you!) 

Drop your own holiday tips and tricks in the comments! Share what you are nervous about/excited about/thankful for! if you've gone through holidays sober before, share how you did it! Did they get better? Worse? Did your loud aunt ever stop asking you if you are ever going to drink again? 

I'm thankful for this sub, for the 4.5 months of sobriety I have, and for pumpkin pie! 

Let's do this!!",72

Quitting drinking was the single best decision I ever made.

Okay so I haven’t been active here in a while but I wanted to pop by and say that today marks four years and I ALMOST FORGOT. I gotta say that alcohol being that small and irrelevant in my life feels GOOD.

I occasionally recall how miserable and upset I was before I stopped drinking. My life has turned around in so many ways. I still have plenty of challenges, but I feel so much more confident in tackling them in sobriety.

I take such better care of myself than I used to. I’m far less judgmental of myself and others, I drink a fuckload of water, I actually want to stay in therapy, I’ve been promoted multiple times, I have my own apartment, I save so much money, I quit smoking, I am happier and I am healthier; it all started with kicking booze out the door.

Quitting drinking gave me the space to look at my life and really do some healing, and I’d never known space like that before. I am so grateful that I’ve had this journey and that it’s panned out the way it has.

Warmth and blessings, all. I’ll try and say hi again soon.",74

My family very much depends on beer, wine, or liquor to get through the holiday season civilly, so I've been a little apprehensive about attending family events going into the holiday season. All of my family knows I'm not drinking, at this point, but I was still assigned to bring the ""adult"" beverages anyway, which really bothered me. I can't decide if my aunt just forgot or if she just doesn't understand that I am not really comfortable going to the liquor store and having the quantity of booze in my possession for any period of time. I don't trust myself not to indulge in it and get absolutely wasted. I decided instead to let my aunt know she needs to assign that to someone else, and I bought two pies and two bottles of martinellis (the classic and the blush). I'm also bringing ginger beer/seltzer sodas. I'm not perfect, nor am I trying to be difficult about contributing to dinner, but I've worked too hard to get here and I'm not throwing it away so easily.

 He's had multiple day ones.  Today he hit 30 days and I'm so proud of him. I made it to 12 on Friday, the longest I've gone in the last 8 years.  And then I relapsed hard. Really hard.

With a 5 year old son ( this may be important).  I drink every night about 1/3 to 1/2 bottle of vodka (750 ml) every night. More on the weekends. I drink after work. Never before or during. I don’t really think I am an alcoholic but some disagree. It doesn’t affect my daily life for the most part. However, my son has behavior issues since starting school this year. I feel like I have created a monster.  Over the course of his life as I am a single mom and “pick my battles” and over compensate with giving him things he wants since he doesn’t have a father. The alcohol helps me cope with this life. I let him get away with more since I am just so stressed. He is not in any danger!  I would NEVER allow it.
I want to say previous to these past 6 months I was an avid marijuana smoker for years after I had my son.  No one ever questioned me smoking weed to cope but alcohol seems to be so much worse to people. 
I’m unsure if I have a drinking problem. And not sure where to go from here. I know I have an addictive personality. May be worth mentioning…I’ve had bariatric surgery (bypass) if that matters.  
My son struggles since starting kindergarten. He is obstinate, runs from class and often times I have to pick him up.  He has had major life changes in the last 6 months. I left his “dad” and moved us to a new apartment. His “dad” is a good guy. But we haven’t had contact with him but once in that past several months. 
Main issue….do I have a drinking problem. What if I switched back to weed?? Is that a problem. No one ever thinks to seem so even though it illegal in my state.

He had a brief but intense battle with cancer, which was further complicated by his weakened body, in particular his heart, which was his actual cause of death (heart failure).  My dad struggled with alcohol throughout his life, though I'd classify him as more of a 2 to 4x per week binge drinker in his prime....but he could drink bottle after bottle of wine in these sessions, easily 3 in a sitting.  It is no doubt in my mind that his lifestyle and choices over his 67 years of life weakened his body, and that alcohol consumption did contribute to his lack of ability to fight in those final hours.  I also know that my dad lived quite unapologetically, and though he may have done things differently if he had a magic ball, he had no interest in quitting.  It was part of his core identify.

After he passed (and even at the hospital), I went on a pretty intense bender off and on for 2 weeks.  I wanted to feel absolutely nothing, and I was willing to go to extremes to do so.  It made a truly dark time 1000x darker and more challenging for me, and also for those around me who not only had to see me in pain, but this numbed variant of pain.  It awoke in me so clearly that this stuff literally does nothing at all but rob me of my happiness and make problems in life more difficult to manage.  The reality of him being gone will continue to be here each and every day, and it just means I have to face each new day with a hangover and extreme self loathing.

Losing my dad so suddenly was so difficult, as any loss of a parent is.  If I think about his final day and all the pain he was in, I will just spin and cycle in an endless pity part for my mom and I.  If there is one good thing to come out of any of this, it's that I am finally committing to getting better 100%.  I'm doing it for me in memory of him, and for all the drinks he had that may have contributed to his situation in the end, whether that be the cancer itself or his weakened organs that weren't strong enough to give him a fighting chance.  I will not let that be my story, and my end.  I'm writing this to hold myself accountable to both my dad and I.  This is where I throw in the towel with alcohol and don't offer myself the option to look back.",33

How have I done it? With this sub! Early recovery I was on this sub daily, read heaps of quit lit and got educated about my brain, tried different recovery groups online, stopped and started drinking over  9 months of attempts at sobriety,, took antabuse for 3 months, came out to all my family and friends as a sober alcoholic, avoided my party people, and got some couselling to understand trauma and addiction. 

Over this time, I also returned home from a war zone after 2 yrs being stuck in covid overseas, even tho I am safe I have friends and ppl I know arrested and tortured, I have PTSD and daily anxiety and chronic pain. BUT I AM SOBER! NO MATTER WHAT! 

I am still a little overweight, still smoking cigarettes, exploring bhuddism and learning mindfulness. I am far from perfect but I am so greatful every day to be sober. I still get cravings especially when triggered by places, events and ppl drinking.. but they come a go like the wind. Now more like a light breeze than a raging storm!  

 I just wanna thank u all for yr daily posts, yr ups and downs, and stops and starts, and your inspiration, and give a huge shout out to everyone who is brave enough to take this recovery journey!

The other thing is I absolutely love drinking, I love having fun with friends, I used to love drinking with my girlfriend (before I essentially was forced to be alone because of these horrible stomach problems) so I feel very hard done by, it’s very difficult to reconcile this unfairness in my mind.

I didn’t think I was an addict until I heard it defined as continued use despite adverse consequences so I guess this means I am.

&#x200B;

Okay, so, last night I got effed up with wine... Today I'm experiencing the fear and I absolutely hate it (as always). I haven't been that drunk for a few months, but plenty of sh\*\* happened lately and I casually kept pouring the damn wine to my glass at my girlfriend's friend's party last night (more like a gathering, not really a party, but she'd kill me if I didn't call it a party).

I'm a 23 year old woman. I started socially drinking at 16 but the first time I have noticed that things got a bit out of hand was when I was 18. All of my grandparents have been alcoholics (my grandmother and both of my grandfathers died from liver cancer), my parents do not drink at all due to this, but my younger sister and I do. When I was 18 I hooked up with an older woman and she was an alcoholic. Once we got together I realised that I've never seen such a severe state of addiction (she drank every day the very moment she woke up, then went to work, drank at work, then got home, ate and slept for an hour and then drank again until bedtime). I was trying to help her but nothing worked. She would stay sober for a month or two and that was it. I eventually gave up, but as I spent lots of time at her place, I started drinking with her. I didn't get addicted to alcohol, but rather to the whole ritual. Just like most relationships with addicts, this one was abusive too (manipulation, gaslighting, temper tantrums, drunk fighting, paranoia etc.), after a year and four months I broke up with her (the same week I got my first job) and started a new relationship (that I'm still in, my current girfriend is the most amazing person I know). Anyways, as I started working I had to  say goodbye to getting drunk several times a week and I did... I just drank on Fridays or Saturdays. But something changed...

Before I started working I was able to drink five-six 0.5 l beers and get home tipsy-ish. I would spend an insane amount of money and not get drunk, and regardless of how much I drank I have always, always had the ability to control myself. But two months after I started working I would get effed up after three beers and have a complete blackout the next day. By the age of 19 I have never experienced a hangover, but then it started and I hated every minute of it. But I couldn't just stop drinking because ""you are young, you are supposed to"" and other peer pressure bs. In my country drinking is a part of the culture so you're basically not considered a real ""native"" if you don't drink. So I kept drinking socially every now and then and in November 2018 I got the drunkest I've ever been and did looooots of stupid sh\*\* (I was raped in May of that year and only my girlfriend knew about it but then all of a sudden I was drunk and spilling my rape story + crying like an idiot in front of people I didn't even know that well). That's when I decided I will never drink again (haha).

But it worked for a while. I didn't have a sip of alcohol until August of 2019. I drank non-alcoholic beers, cocktails etc. And it was good (cocktails taste much better without alcohol). I mean, I have never had the everyday drinking routine, even before it would be only a few times a week, but not daily.

After I ""relapsed"" in August of 2019 I kept drinking socially and on special occasions (due to last year's lockdown I had to celebrate my birthday alone and I made myself a couple of cocktails and enjoyed my day). I'm severely anxious and I don't really like hanging out with people, I was also depressed for nine years and I have self-harmed for a long time, however, that's behind me now, I have short episodes of depression every few months but that's fine. Now I'm just anxious af and I have OCD. (Also, I'm introverted af) Whenever I overdrink it's when I'm in social gatherings, when there's more than one person with me. And I cannot stop. I can't drink two glasses and stop, two glasses are always four and four are eight and eight are a complete blackout and anxiety. But when I'm sober, I'm quiet, I can't say a thing, words get stuck in my throat and I nervously sweat like a pig. And people think I'm stupid because I can't form a coherent sentence (and I'm a writer, ironically). So... I tend to avoid social events because of this.

But I can't run from them forever, last night I finally got out of my apartment and went with my girlfriend to this ""party"" at her friend's place. Thought I will only drink a glass of wine. I drank eight. Was slurring my words and sh\*\*.

On last Sunday (November 14th) my alcoholic ex died. She was in coma for a few months  due to brain inflammation and she contracted the rona v\*rus last week... And I fell apart once I've heard the news. I have had the urge to get pass out drunk ever since then, but I have managed to ignore it. And last night I have finally acted on it. Now I'm disgusted of myself, but I also feel like I would enjoy emptying the bottle of gin tonic that's staring at me from the shelf. And I always have alcohol around me, I get anxious if I don't, although I might not drink it at all, some bottles stay there for months, but I love to think that they're here in case I need them. Once I have realised this, I got a bit scared that I might be showing signs of alcoholism. And seeing people in my life destroy themselves with and because of alcohol makes this even more terrifying. Please help... Or at least send me a virtual hug, I kinda need it these days...",5

I sat at the bar since I was solo. Some of the normal sights were a bit of a trigger. The various beer taps, rows of liquor bottles, and the handful of people there drinking on what is probably a short work week for them (US / Thanksgiving). I’m almost 2 years sober and I wasn’t insanely tempted. I recognize it as a trigger and know how to deal with it. 

I noticed the 2 guys next to me who were blue collar workers on their lunch. One was drinking tea and the other ordered a light beer. By the time I finished, the tea guy had gone to double Crowns and the light beer guy had added shots of tequila. There’s no way they didn’t both have to drive and they also were going back to work based on their conversation. 

It was amazing to me to see this unfold. While my drinking brain is much more quiet than it used to be, it was still telling me that one beer, like the guy beside me had, would be okay. But I could literally see the progression of where that can go as these guys gave in to the same voice. 

Play the tape forward my friends. We know where things go if we have one beer or make one exception.

Ever since I turned 21 two years ago, I've drank literally almost every single day. Don't even want to think about the financial cost. But in the past year, things got pretty rough. I graduated college before I was emotionally ready, lost about all of my friends, & going through some pretty terrible family things. 

I work from home with a housemate that doesn't get along with me. It's so hard to fight the urge to have a drink - but it's never just *a* drink. I think over the past year, I've had 4-5 nights a week where I get blackout drunk alone. But not being able to recognize the person I was a year ago in the mirror is one hell-of-a-way to get started back on the right track.

So, let this serve as my commitment to working toward sobriety. One step at a time. 

That said, I find myself 'bored' drinking very often. I play video games, go on walks, shopping, etc. but truth is, I just have too much free time & hardly any concrete hobbies. Does anyone have any suggestions on a new hobby to pick up? Or a way to fight a sudden urge for a sip?

She was kind, and thoughtful. We spend so much time together, anything from walks to video games to deep conversations. I really, really miss the person she was.

She never drank or smoked, while I drank a little (but didn't become a problem drinker until later on). After college, she regretted not partying or socializing much in college and having her nose in a book all the time. So I was still in school and she moved away, and started to drink and smoke.

I moved near where she lived after college and we reconnected. We maintained a friendship for about 2 years but she just kept getting less and less considerate. She no longer wanted to go on walks or have deep talks. All she wanted to do was party with me and at this point, I was trying to cut back and quit.

So it got to a point where I hosted her and our friends over consistently and she never wanted wanted put in any effort into our hangouts or friendship. I tried to be flexible because she mentioned she was very depressed, but started to get tired putting in all the effort to maintain our relationship.

We no longer talk at this point. And I'm wondering if anyone else here has experienced someone close who had a drastic personality change? I miss the friend I had who didn't party and was actually thoughtful and kind, instead of doing and saying whatever she wants without a care on how that makes others feel.

Also, I want to preface that I'm not saying that my alcohol abuse doesn't play a role. I drank alone a lot and isolated myself from others when I did, and while I never choose to interact with her while drunk, I recognize that I'm not totally innocent either.

But some motivation or advice on how you guys deal with these thoughts would be cool.

(5 days sober observation),"So I (26F) stopped drinking out of the blue 5 days ago because I was tired of feeling like crap physically and mentally. I was cruising through 2-3 bottles of wine a night (depending on the wine) and I had gained 80 pounds over the course of 2 years in which my alcoholism raged at its worst. Being drunk would lead me to eating so much, even if I wasn't hungry.. so the scale continued to tick up. 5 days ago I weighed 285lbs. I weighed myself this morning, 271. I was shocked, it had to be a mistake. I weighed again, and yep, there it was. 271. Now, stopping the alcohol itself did not make me lose 14 pounds in 5 days, (though the empty calories I avoided probably helped) but I'm feeling so motivated and determined to keep going. I desperately want a drink, to celebrate. But IWNDWYT.",20

But changing my perspective lowered my stress about staying sober during the holidays greatly.,"I M(26) come from a broken home so I've had to develop surrogate families to bridge the gap to a sense of normalcy. While my family is extremely dysfunctional and I've had to keep some distance for my sanity, they are loving and even though I spend most of the holidays with my second families I do make appearances at my biological family gatherings even though it stresses me out. In years past I've managed to do this by sneaking in alcohol to ease my anxiety (I have had to hide it because my mom and grandmother have both been dry for over 30 years because of my abusive alcoholic grandfather who I only met a few times when I was young before he drank himself to death). This year I'm going to have to give up my crutch and be sober. Ive been dreading Thanksgiving all week because of that but this morning I thought about the situation in a different way. While I usually only planned on getting a buzz at those gatherings I would invariably end up too drunk to drive and have to stay longer than I planned until I got sober. This year, if it becomes too much for me to handle I'll be able to confidently leave without worrying about if I'm safe to drive. I have an easier and healthier escape. This still isn't perfect, I'm still stressed about facing this season sober but if I do get through Thanksgiving I will also hit 2 full months of sobriety which I haven't done since I started drinking at 19. To all of you stressing about being sober during the holidays I can't say it will be easy but we can get through this together but first we have to not drink today.",7

It involved me craving and obsessing about getting drunk, while managing an ex who I was trying to get out of my apartment but have her leave all the booze, weed, and cigarettes(all things I don't do since we stopped dating). The dream felt like it lasted hours, just hours of non-stop craving and obsessing over finding more to drink, more to smoke, more, more, more. 

And I am so glad that is not my actual day-to-day life on this quit attempt.

I actually feel pretty relaxed almost all the time. It's like my default state is ""non-specified happy"". Even now, having just a few minutes between waking up and writing this down, everything feels alright again. I usually feel worse after a dream focused around relapsing on smoking, mainly because when I dream about that it's just a casual thing that I'm doing and I'm not really thinking about the act of smoking.

2021-11-23 09:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r0f1bz/just_began_my_journey_for_sobriety/,Just began my journey for sobriety,"I was in a jazz club in Barcelona on vacation, 3 double shots of bourbon in, ready to order a fourth, and it hit me. I have no control. I don't drink to just loosen up, I drink to get *fucked.* I drink to get sloppy, because it makes everything feel better. I don't have a bad life by any means - I have a wife who I love dearly, a job that, while stressful, is still fulfilling in ways office work never would be - but the cloud of depression that's been following me forever just weighs down on my back, all day, every day. Except when I drink. 

But I should know better. The last 2 months at my workplace, I've been seeing a bizarre number of patients with alcohol-related GI issues from daily drinking, nevermind the ones going through acute withdrawal. I've known I have a problem with regulation for years, and while I don't buy into any superstitions, it's hard not to see that as a sign. So I took a vacation from work, went to Spain for 2 weeks, and in that jazz club I realized I couldn't do it anymore. I leaned over to my wife in the bar and told her I'm an alcoholic. 

It was surprisingly easy at first. I didn't even feel the urge to drink for the rest of the trip. When I got back, the booze got locked up away from where I can get to it, because I know myself, and temptation is always lurking, even if I don't feel it in the moment. Especially when I go back to work and stress myself out trying to take care of 5-6 high acuity patients half the week. 

The urge is starting to come back. The sun goes down, and I want to drink. It's fucking poison and I want to drink. I don't even know what it is I'm trying to dull anymore. My life doesn't suck anymore. I've got it good. So what's the deal? 

I have a friend who's been a significant catalyst for my sobriety, themselves a recovering alcoholic. They ask me to come to AA with them, and it sounds nice, but the problem is I don't know if the tenets of the program jive with my personal philosophies. I don't believe in a higher power, beyond, I guess, the chaos of nature. Is that enough? Any other atheists go to AA? Are there alternatives that work for others?",9

I am back. Had been doing well--had longer breaks in between drinking and the benefits were REALLY starting to show. Much like a lot of folks here, my brain told me I could go back to moderation, but of course that led back to day drinking, taking off of work, the lies, the embarrassment, the not eating, the vomiting, the guilt. You name it. 

Day One was absolutely miserable; I was feeling the effects of kindling HARD. Started to attempt to work at 4:00am after stopping drinking at 7:30 the previous evening. I work fully WFH, so it's been easier to hide--and really the only time I ""talk"" to co-workers is when I have a question or during our team meetings (as you can imagine, it's gets pretty damn lonely pretty damn fast). So again, I thought I'd start work early to end work early. 

Not this time. I logged on and my eyes were so unfocused, I was so physically and mentally exhausted,  I had been so sick and vitamin depleted my hands were shaking I could barely get through 30 mins. of the work. Plus, the guilt and shame of some of dumb things I've said over the past five days or so came flooding back with a vengeance. My anxiety was INSANE. I ended up calling in ""sick"" and immediately took a shower and stated reading this Sub. I read it almost non-stop from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm. I needed that sense of community, I needed the support, and I needed to know that this CAN be done. 

I ended up sleeping for damn near 9 hours which is a blessing--though the dreams were insane and many were around the dumb mistakes I have done in the past. I am still feeling a little wobbly, and my hands still have a slight tremor, but I am thankful I didn't wake up fretting about what I did last night, how I need to have a drink before noon just to feel outgoing and functional, and I am here typing this. Work is not going to be terribly fun, but compared to 24 hours ago, I feel DRASTICALLY different--in a good way. 

I'm still going to allow myself the grace and take breaks as needed, but I will make it through the day feeling accomplished. The anxiety is still there and there are moments this morning where I felt flushed and my heart was racing a bit (which has now subsided), but I am staying hydrated, took my vitamins, and did some deep breathing. This has got stick. Yesterday felt like one of the worst days of my life, but hopefully I'll NEVER have to feel that way again.

The hardest part for me is learning how to go to bed like a normal person. I have so much work to do and so many hobbies, and I put them off all day and then at night I either want to do all the shit I put off all day or I want to go to a bar where I can forget that I'm lonely as fuck and trapped in a pointless repetitive loop.

“He’s not going to be able to prescribe anything for you.” 

He comes into the room, and repeats the same information. I have to go see a  Psychiatrist. I ask him, why couldn’t you just tell me this on the phone? He doubles my Prozac, and I am charged my $30 copay. All in less than 10 minutes. I felt, used.

I know fixing yourself is ugly. It’s not always going to be “write five things you are grateful for” that’s just a piece of it all.

We are little bags of money, depleted and defeated, and self medicating with whatever works.  My poison is alcohol, to kill the poison inside me, to silence it.

When you are in the battle every day, you doing notice the physical change until someone you haven't seen in a month or two says. I didn't recognize you.  Then I do these silly side-by-side pictures. 

    I am not going to lie. It's still a little challenging.  The first six months were definitely the most challenging thing I have ever gone through and not cave. Just last week, I was going through some depressions that almost led me to a beer.  But I pushed through and returned to read all your stories, and here I am again, feeling good. 
    I will be the first male in my family to break the cycle of a daily drinker. This Alcohol-free lifestyle is here to stay, and I have already changed my lifestyle, so I am not a drinker!!! 
  
     Now!  If I could ever relax, I would have it made. For thirty years, I have always gone to a beer for relaxation.  Now it's not there, and that is my only problem now.",1294

**but we don't have to drink**  in fact it will go better if we don't; that's a guarantee.

This is my 35th sober thanksgiving in a row, and i am choosing to do it with a family of choice.  If you are with your family, the thing to remember is your family knows how to push your buttons because they installed them in the first place.  Detachment works.  In fact it can be fun to watch them react when you don't.

If things get rough - I would also suggest (covid conditions allowing) finding an alcathon.  These are continuous AA meetings most likely nearby, (and nobody is going to care if you are in AA or not)  If you need to say something ""I'm X and uncle fred makes me want to drink""  or whatever - is all you need  to say.. It gets you out of the house, it's a safe place, if you so choose you get to mortify your mom by saying ""I need an AA meeting""  or not.  Find them via google and AA and your location.  The helpline will know where they are.  Also on zoom so if you are techie you can usurp the football game on the tv and really cause your brother in law to lose his mind..

**and of course here on SD I am sure chat will be busy and posts will be answered by others hiding in closets with their phones**

I have, on the odd occasion, managed to stick to one or two drinks and honestly I may as well have stayed completely sober. If anything it deflates my energy levels even more, the same way someone may have a glass of wine before bed to help them sleep.

So instead of feeling deflated, we choose to keep drinking, to keep the buzz going. And while we feel good for the time being, we all know what the end result is, that is why we're here after all.

The cirrhosis is now in regression. It will never fully heal, but I no longer have to have monthly meetings with palliative care. I have a supportive friend group. I’m going back to school, and I’m involved in several programs.

If there was something that I could drink/eat/put under my tongue that would make me happy, I would still do it in a heart beat. Part of my recovery is realizing that there isn’t a magical substance that can get rid of my problems forever. It’s the symptom not the cure etc. I’m still struggling with a sense of grief over that. The problems don’t die, they just lie in wait.

Even with the wonderful people in my life, nobody is comfortable talking about the messy, morbid side of substance abuse. Dt’s are no joke, but a year later I still go through extreme chemical drops in my body that lead to a few hours of contraction-like pain and incessant vomiting.

It. Is. Hard. Raw-dogging reality is like a day-to-day punch in the face.

I’m making it through by clinging to stubbornness and pride. I’m happy that I’m sober. Nobody tells you how much free time you have when you don’t spend it drinking. I’m trying to make good use of it. Good luck out there, friends.",109

By bad, I mean I found myself within 5 minutes in my car on my way to get beer. I had the itch and it needed to be scratched ASAP. 

I drove to liquor store that I used to go to everyday. The entire drive I’m asking myself what the hell am I doing? Go back home. You’re gonna regret this. Etc. But at the same time, this drive that I once used to take everyday felt so familiar. Like it felt.. Right. (if that makes sense). So I continued on to the store. 

I walk in and I’m greeted by Steve.

Steve knew me well during my drinking days and witnessed my decline with alcohol, as I was an everyday customer to him for years. He also knows that I’m sober, but I occasionally stop in for NAs that he special orders for me. 

Steve: “Hey drkumph! I’m sorry bud, but I couldn’t get your NAs this week.” 

Me: “That’s cool, I’m actually here to make a mistake haha.” 

Steve: “……… You sure?”

I stopped dead in my tracks and immediately asked myself, “Fuck. Am I?”

We’re standing in front of the giant wall off cooler doors full of beer looking back at me while I debated back and forth in my head about what to do. 

Steve: “You’ve been doing so great man, don’t give up now.” 

Me (in my head): “Don’t fucking tell me what to do Steve.” 

I tell him he’s right and that I’m gonna home.  What Steve doesn’t know is that instead I’m gonna go to the grocery store on the other side
of town, where no one knows me or can convince me not to. 

I get there and sit in the parking lot for 20 mins or so thinking about what Steve said, “You sure?”. I eventually decide to go in, grab my old usual 12 pack of beer and head to the front to check out. On the way there I think I went back and forth from the liquor section five times. Physically acting out the mental gymnastics that was happening in my head. I must have looked like an idiot. I end up walking out with beer in hand. “You sure?”


Finally I get home, put the beer in my fridge and closed the door. That was it. Just like that I didn’t have a desire to drink anymore. Why?

Steve, that’s why. I don’t know if it was the way he said it to me or what, but the entire hour long adventure of running around town looking for a drink, he had me asking myself, “You sure?”

I wasn’t. 

So thank you Steve. Thank you for thinking of me as a person and not a customer to make money off of. You could have easily sold to me but looked out for my best interests instead. Appreciate it. 

P.s. Beer is my fridge still. Going to give to my neighbor tomorrow for blowing our leaves.",164

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning friends! 

I feel like the last couple of DCI's have been a little... heavy. Courage vs the fear of rejection... Self compassion vs self flagellation... They are good and worthy topics, but at this point even I am like ""Is Overbeingoverit feeling okay?"" So I thought today we might take it a little easier. 

A few months ago, I was reading through an old journal of mine that I kept in my early 20's. In one entry, I was talking about going to a Taco Tuesday that my friends and I used to go to. It had $1 margaritas and $0.50 tacos, which was an amazing deal even in 2001. In this journal I had written about how I had chosen to eat 4 tacos rather than drink 2 margaritas because I was flat broke and at the time my drinking was not yet out of control. And at the bottom of the page, I had written:

Tacos > margaritas

I'm happy to be back to a place in my life where I once again think that tacos are greater than booze, so I've decided to make a list of things that are also greater than booze, and I was hoping my fellow Sobernauts could help me make a more comprehensive list to refer to, in case I ever forget again that Tacos > booze. 

1. Being the little spoon > booze
2. Anything with cilantro > booze
3. That old movie ""Overboard"" with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell > booze
4. Listening to my son play bass > booze
5. Baby animals of all types excluding spiders > booze
6. Muscle cars from the 1970's > booze
7. Jeff Goldblum, just, as a human being > booze
8. True crime podcasts > booze
9. That brief moment of silence between when the previews end and the movie begins and you're so full of anticipation and it's finally starting > greater than booze
10. The soft fuzz on the tips of my dog's ears > booze

Now it's your turn. What do you want to add to the list that is > booze?

For some context I’m 20 and have been drinking very heavily for the past 7 months. I started because of some mental problems and I never really thought of it as a problem till now. I drink probably on average 8 drinks a day 6 days a week. But it’s just steadily gone up and the last month I probably average 10 a day.

I never thought of it as a problem cause I thought I could just stop. But I can’t and I go out of my way to hide it from friends and family. I tried tapering off but couldn’t because I could not control myself.

Now I’m supposed to go on a trip with my family tmrw but I don’t think I can I have not drank for two nights but I’m very scared of the withdrawal and don’t know what to do. I already have had headaches, some chest pain and not able to sleep. Can anyone please give me some advice.",13

Turkey and all that stuff is just out of the question given that I’ve been working through some choppy seas for some time and will likely do the same this Wednesday too. 

Anyhow, my recipe calls for about 1/2 cup of red wine. I have made this same wonderful dish, while sober, with a bit of red wine vinegar and a dash of balsamic reduction and it’s just lovely.  Makes no difference. 

Cue to me in the store. I walked all over the store getting my steps in and grabbing all the things from my list plus a few other items.  My brains is rattling with work, the recipe and the thought that I could just use wine and serve the rest to my guests.

 “It’s fine”, says my brain, “just buy some wine.” (It sounded like a snotty teenager.) 

 Other half of brain, says, “Do not go near that area, you are in a fragile state. Do you hear me?” 

The other half won. It spoke firmly and kindly, like a 7th grade English teacher. It meant business.  

All the groceries are put away and I’ll make a list for my husband of things to pick up on Wednesday evening.

	*  ground decaf coffee 
	* red wine (please put it out of my sight and reach ♥️- I guess I’m kind of fragile r/n)

Drank every night. Started off as a ""fun"" thing to unwind, but turned into an anxiety-fueled mess. It was a bad decision. It took such toll on me. I gained so much weight. I lost so much money. I really regret this. 

Anyways, I came back home yesterday, for the holidays. Staying here for over a month, until January. A few weeks ago, when I was back at college, I had intrusive thoughts about if I would drink at home in secret. These thoughts disgusted me. 

I decided, no, I'm not going to. I didn't want to feel guilty and secretive in my own home. With my own family. I decided to break the cycle. Last night was difficult. The first night is the hardest. But, I told myself that it'll only get easier from here. Got scattered sleep, for like 5 hours. But got through it. I woke up today and instead of feeling hungover, guilty, and exhausted, I felt proud and happy. For the first time in months, I woke up not hating myself. 

I'm excited at the thought that in about a week or so, I'll feel even better. For now, I want to focus on going back to my old self, losing this weight, and making a plan about how I'm not going to relapse when I go back to school in January. Maybe I need to actually talk to a professional or start journaling or something.

I just wanted to share my accomplishment. Reading through posts, I can't wait until I get to the 30 day, 50 day, 100 day. I am feeling hopeful about the future and actually enjoying this holiday season instead of drinking my way through it.",11

It was a very difficult day, and I have had many difficult days since this journey started.  But not once did I think drinking would help.  Yes, I have asked myself why, of all times, during this very tough stretch, did I stop?  I have had two very tough years, and these 600 days have had it all, let me tell ya.  So many times I've watched friends drinking and I've thought, yep, that would certainly make this situation easier, to just numb out and check out.  To be able to dive into a glass and not care for a little bit.  

But I know in my heart of hearts and with all my heart that I will never go back.  Drinking just kicks the can down the road.  The situations don't change, but my reaction to them has.  I can face them head on, every brain cell available to deal, or I can numb out and face them tomorrow.  I choose today. I don't run away, I don't check out.  I shake my fist at all the bullshit.

I was quite overwhelmed and feel like I’ll have to get used to it. I have religious trauma from my childhood and have a hard time with the god thing, even though I know it’s up to interpretation. But I just want to open up, do something that scares me and give it a try. It was relieving to be in the physical presence of many women who know very well my struggle, and I’m actually looking forward to going every week.

Ive gone to kava bars and other non-alcoholic venues and mostly just feel like an outsider looking in. I feel so old, like I am past the age of wonderment and excitement. When I learn something new, I no longer feel like a genius for having learned it “already”, I feel like an idiot for not knowing it “yet”. Its been forever since I had a “crazy night out” , its all behind me. I go long periods with little social contact, dont feel like I enjoy socializing, and am 10x more awkward than I used to be when alcohol made socializing an endorphin releasing experience. I hate people now and I feel old. The times of fantasizing about what the future may be like are over, and now I feel like at almost 30, I am stuck with what I have now. Awful feeling

Did alcoholism enable me to feel younger for longer? I want to go back to high energy and reckless.

I've known it's a problem for awhile. But last night, this... minuscule thing made me sob.

For a while now, I've had some dry patches on my fingers and I was confused what they were from. I thought maybe my PS4 controller, and then maybe because that's how I hold the steering wheel when I drive. Now that I know what it is, I can't believe I didn't notice it sooner. 

Last night, I opened a 1/2 pint of vodka and it hurt. I realized the dry patches on the middle joints of my pointer and thumb are where I open liquor bottles. I open them so often that my skin is noticeably dry and peeling in the area. I thought ""well, I open other bottled things!"" Yeah, like Propel and Gatorade, to make me feel better after drinking. 

I don't know. It feels like a whole new low. It feels worse than the doctor telling me I need to stop. It feels worse than knowing this whole time that I've had a problem.

I just want some feedback but first ill say a few things.

Early February of this year I stopped drinking and I was sober for almost 5 months. Everything seemed cool and I was honestly happy. Mid June I jumped back in and I went overboard for a while. Everytime I hit 2 weeks sober it felt like the hardest thing in my life, not even comparable to my ~4.5 months before.

Last time I was sober for 2 weeks I felt severely depressed and my anxiety was off the charts. I do have a lot of mental health issues (im not on any medicine, I tried that route for many years with no positive results) but lately they seem nonexistent when I drink. And when I say drink, I mean reasonable amounts. I feel like im self medicating with alcohol and its been working.

I stopped drinking liquor and anything harder than beer and everything got a lot better. I've been doing really good and I've been happy but on average ill have about 6 drinks on a weekday. I dont really get *drunk* on weekends but I do drink a lot more than I do on weekdays. I never used to drink water and I'd skip meals and get ridiculously intoxicated, now I drink a lot more water and eat pretty regularly and it definitely keeps me in line.

How does everyone feel about this? Does anyone here think drinking in moderation is alright, especially since I've been working on healthier habits in general? I don't even feel guilty for drinking like I used to, really the *only* downside in my eyes is that I have a bit of a beer gut and I'm sure I could fix that with a little bit of exercise.

Any thoughts / suggestions / feedback would be much appreciated, I just don't think I can go back to being sober again and right now I'm completely fine with that. Thanks for taking the time to read my post, sorry it's kinda long.",3

Like dead center of your forehead? Because every time I quit I always feel it ... maybe even when drunk too but eventually I feel like it goes away.

Around the time I started drinking more heavily, maybe like 3 or 4 months later, I visited my brother and he smashed my head against a brick wall and broke my nose. I'm not sure if not drinking is the cause of it or if the broken nose is, but I often drink thinking it is the cause and will relieve the feeling. It just feels like something is tight around that area.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  I saw my doctor and she said it was probably a sinus headache and gave me nasal spray. I don't feel that is a long term solution.

Update: thanks, it seems like this might be the result of a broken nose. I think I'm going to quit drinking and redirect that energy in to working out with the focus of one day returning the favour to my brother. Payback's a bitch.

2021-11-22 21:20:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/r02g61/some_thoughts_from_a_recently_sober_alcoholic/,Some thoughts from a recently sober alcoholic,"For me, with sobriety comes peace. But sobriety to me doesn't simply mean not picking up a drink - it's an entire way of thinking. I'm 36 years old, and only now am I breathing, acting, and living sober for the first time. Clarity of mind is an amazing thing. I often wonder if such a sudden and profound change can last, and continuously I'm encouraged to keep proceeding down this road. My mind is finally open to the signs that were always there. I no longer miss the little things that make one a worthwhile person. It's as if I'm getting to know myself for the very first time. 

Spirituality is something that always existed somewhere in the back of my mind. I often prayed, but it resembled the pleas of a desparate man more so than the ones of a thoughtful one. One of my first meetings, I heard the phrase ""I was given the gift of desparation"", and I believe this wholeheartedly, as it was only out of this desparation that I realized I needed to give up control. The way I was behaving resembled something close to walking insanity. Every facet of life suffered, from my understanding of self to the way I interacted with others. My sense of humor, though intelligent and quick, had a sarcastic, biting tone that people of my disposition often display, stemming from a loss of faith and god and everything good in the world. 

Once you become desparate enough, you give up. And what's ironic is that this is the only way to gain strength once this disease gets ahold of you. You realize that you should no longer be in control, that you need god in your life in some form or another, and that you cannot do this without the help and support of others.

One of the biggest things I've realized is how important relationships are, how much we all gain from them. Checking back in has begun to pay me back immediately - I care more, my interactions are more genunine, I think outside myself, and most importantly - I shut up and listen. It's amazing to ask a question and instead of waiting to talk, actually tune in. You will learn so much, and you can feel the appreciation and gratitude from the other person as they share their burden, thereby cutting it in half. 

By no means will life immediately get better. But as you start to string together good decision after good decision, the results can't help but unfold. Do the next right thing and watch what happens. Often times we will not be sure what the next right thing is - this is the time to be still and listen. Go somewhere quiet, ask your question to the god of your choosing, and just be still. There is no need to act if you're acting in the wrong direction - it's better to just be still. I've often said the phrase ""Slow down to speed up"", which rings true now more than ever. It's better to slow down, be still, come to the correct conclusion, and act accordingly than to act hastily in the wrong direction. 

The Universe will speak to you in all sorts of ways - through people, through a feeling, a slight touch from a leaf at just the right moment, a saying on a pen, literally anything - you need only be open and willing to see. As your heart becomes more full, your energy becomes more healthy and is then reverberated back through the Universe in all sorts of ways. Eventually some of that energy comes back to you, and the rest is just good energy that gets to exist in the Universe because of you, and you can take pride in that. Holding your head high is the most amazing feeling in the world, something I never did while drunk, at least not in any meaningful way.",10

I've tried many different ways to quit this self destructive habit.  So far my best success has been with The Sinclair Method.   TSM has been working great for months. I have gone from averaging 12-15 units in a drinking session to being able to go weeks AF and keep it at 2sd or one and done.  My longest stretch was 2 weeks as of the other day. I was gaining my life back.  I felt hope after years fighting this compulsion that has cost me and those around me so much.

3 nights ago, despite my success with TSM, and everything that brings. I was not only non-compliant I binged everything!  It was awful. I went a 3 night bender of, THC, junk food, 6 to 8 units a night as fast as I could down them, video games and pints of ice cream concurrently.  I acted like an animal.  All of my old habits roared back.  None of it was satisfying. It felt so empty.

I am struggling with keeping a balanced perspective.  I am AF free for weeks at a time now.  I used to be able to not even go 24 hours.   A lot of harm reduction is taking place and progress has been made but I am so ashamed of myself for this self sabotage not to mention the hangxiety and wasted time.

I have this fear that even with all of this therapy, groups and medication the bottle will kill me.  It is always waiting somewhere in the shadows.  While not an AA fan after trying that revolving door for years I readily admit I am ""powerless"" against that dopamine rush from alcohol.  If I get that first nip its neigh likely I wont stop till I pass out.  I am asking the group for some help keeping this positive and learning from this instead of falling into a spiral of rumination and self pity/loathing.

The problem is I can't disarm them with rational thought because they are both objectively true on some level.  It \*does\* help with my crippling anxiety because yeah ethanol has anxiolytic  properties, and yeah there is a noticeable improvement in my ability to socialize and relate to others.  Obviously there are downsides, obviously I know it ultimately causes more anxiety (rebound),  it's expensive monetarily,  it's damaging my body, it's socially unacceptable.  But for some reason the cons just don't seem to outweigh the pros.  I'd rather have the long-term consequences than give up the short-term pros.  I don't go around drunk or anything like that.  I just have a little beer throughout the day.  It's very literally self-medication.

The amount of time I’m wasting is absurd and with a new house & family, I have so much positive fun stuff to get done and do. I’ve been in a state of less than mediocre. I know kicking the alcohol to the curb will change all of this. Easier said then done, as I know. Just have to get through these first few days..Thanks for letting me dump all my thoughts here.

I haven’t fallen off the wagon, but it’s hard some days and only getting harder with the holidays. This is the most I’ve struggled with my sobriety since the start, and there’s a part of me that feels like I’m fucking something up. I feel like by now I’m “supposed” to have it all figured out and easy. The fact that I’m hitting some bumps is really ramping up the shame and anxiety, which as many of you know first hand is usually a big trigger to drink. 

I went to a meeting last week (my first) and it was helpful, but they were SO shocked and excited by the years under my belt that I felt weird being honest about where I’m at now given how well I managed in early sobriety. 

I guess these cravings are validating that I’ve got a legitimate issue and definitely should not drink but damn I’m feeling frustrated. Any fellow multi-year folks who can relate?",11

It's also spicy as hell which is a nice endorphin release if you're looking to feel something a little besides complete sobriety or being drunk. 

One can or filet of tuna
One chopped onion
A shit ton of garlic (never enough IMO)
2 jalapeno poppers, de seeded for less spice if that's your vibe
Head of cilantro
One egg
Whatever else you like!

Essentially toss all that shit in a pan, mix it to a good mixed consistency, and season it with a little cayenne and garlic powder and throw it on a tortilla

2021-11-22 18:58:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qzzowo/on_being_bored/,On being bored,"I've seen a lot of posts about what to do about being bored and usually I'm the one with a list of things I do to stay not-bored. Fwiw, this weekend is being an, ""I'm bored and also nothing sounds good"" weekend. Nothing I normally do sounds fun, things I don't normally do sound like too much work, all of that.

What I'm making myself do is for one to name my issue. I'm bored. Bored sucks, but it's part of the human experience. My ADHD makes bored feel extra painful, but it's still not going to kill me. (And I'm sure there's all kinds of people all over with reasons bored is extra painful who don't drink because of it.) What WILL kill me is if I decide to go back to drinking - plus there's a good chance I'll just be bored and drunk.

Other than that, it's a lot of accepting I'm just bored right now. I'm slowly getting the things done I need to get done despite them being boring bc hell, they need to get done. I'm still going to exercise and make my lunch for work tomorrow bc I'll at least be glad I did them once I'm done. I'm pausing in between to watch vids or play Animal Crossing. Even though both of those are also boring to me right now, it's still filling the time and not drinking. The goal is to finish what I have to early, get some tea, and go to bed early to see if tomorrow is better.

I don't know if this will help anyone, but for me at least, just accepting ""I am bored, and it sucks but it's normal and it's not going to kill me"" is actually making me feel less like I need to reach for something to ""fix"" it. Maybe one of the things I need to get done tonight will boost me out of it, but even if not it's still gonna be ok.

I live with my mom who drinks every day and is dying from her alcoholism. She is never sober, not even when she wakes up, and she is always screaming. I got stuck here with her a couple years ago, we do not have a good relationship as she was abusive and in prison most of my childhood. 

I don't have a lot of support. My grandparents, who raised me, are in TN and they have never been very supportive. They keep asking me to do something about my mom, and not seeming to give a fuck that I'm sober/her drinking affects my mental health. 

I'm trying to get my life back on track from when I was drinking, but I'm starting all over basically. I have a lot of fines and my license may be put on hold until I pay them. I haven't driven since my DUI in 2016, was too afraid to. It wouldn't have been as hard if I had just gotten my license reinstated years ago, because now the state I had my license is in may now hold my license because of marijuana fines.

I started going to therapy over my PTSD, brought up a traumatic experience to the therapist, and he made me file a police report I did not want to file and now it's a whole fucking thing. 

My therapist told me I should feel proud and strong, but how? I'm at the point where I feel like I have the not drinking under control, but the rest of my life is still in shambles. 

Less than a year ago, I would have drank over something stupid, and now I'm sober while dealing with a lot. It's a big change. I'm not doing it gracefully. I told my therapist, sometimes it felt easier drinking. He said of course it did, it offered a quick relief to anxiety and depression. But that this is part of working through all of that, actually feeling uncomfortable emotions and not running from them. 

I'm sorry for the rant. It's not a good day. But I'm not drinking over it.",33

The most devasting thing about trying to stop had been the failing. I failed a long time. 

And finally - I was in jail. Really. 

Being free to think about other things has been amazing, and so even if I've had a really rough year - reading all these people yearning to be free and wondering if you can - I just wanted to say three years passes. And it feels really good.

From whatever point you are at. Mine was fifty. I thought it was over.

If you can just stay sober today, it passes.

How did it went so far? When I say I don‘t drink people make fun of me, ask questions, ask for a reason, make assumptions and speculate if I may be ill or have a bet running. Even get insulted. 

Why do I need to justify for this? Why don‘t I need to justify for getting completely wasted and sometimes ruining something?

It was one beer this evening. Not much, still, I feel bad for breaking my streak, not saying no, not withstanding that pressure of people around me.

2021-11-22 16:23:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qzw8yj/there_was_happiness_in_there_it_was_just_buried/,"There was happiness in there, it was just buried deep","A week and a half ago I didn’t expect to be posting to this forum again. In all honesty, I expected I’d be back where I started – sitting on the living room floor in a stupor, the kitchen bench littered in empty bottles and cans. The idea of committing to a life without alcohol seemed a step far out of my reach, and something I could only hope was somewhere in my future.

Until now I’ve taken no accountability for it. Alcohol was something that helped me cope with my depression, my loneliness and my time without the kids. I’d find any excuse to drink, be it celebration or commiseration. It didn’t even need to be for me. A friend could be having a tough day and I’d use that as my reason to drown my sorrows with them.

But this is by the by. I made the bizarre and impromptu decision that I wouldn’t drink for a few days. Not because I didn’t want to, and maybe not even because I planned to stick with it, but because I didn’t know what else to do.

And in these last 10 days I’ve discovered a few things about myself that I thought I’d share.

For starters, I have every right to feel proud of myself and don’t need to feel ashamed of this addiction. It was never my choice to become an alcoholic, despite my actions actively fueling it. I was just not listening to my own voice, and instead listening to whatever horrible thing sits in there somewhere in the depths of my mind that tells me the only way to experience happiness is with a drink.

I have come to learn what willpower really feels like. Even during my weight loss journey I felt in control and confident in my ability to see it through. This is different. My head plays tricks on me; it tells me that I can moderate, that I was just going through a rough patch, and that I won’t be the same guy people love when he’s a dozen beers deep. It’s bullshit. I have decided to really embrace the feeling of vulnerability when I pass by the alcohol aisle at the supermarket, and the deep sense of satisfaction I get with the victory of walking past with my nose turned up.

And finally, but most importantly, there is happiness and positivity in me that I never knew existed. Those who have known me longest have often said they could feel my fall into depression. I’ve spent a good portion of the last week mapping this out and talking to my ex about my drinking habits – things I clearly hadn’t seen or even acknowledged were an issue. And yes, unsurprisingly the two have been fast friends since the start.

So all of this to say, despite still taking my medication, this last week has been the happiest I can remember. I feel like an anesthetic has worn off and I’m slowly emerging out a decade long daze. I walk every day not because I force myself to, but because I crave it. I have spoken to more friends over the past week than I have in the last 12 months prior. I’m making plans and setting goals. And most of all, I’m absolutely hanging out to see my kids this weekend so they can experience a dad who is happy in their company and completely there for them.

I've never drank during the day, and I'm lucky enough to own my own business now, so I've sort of gotten away with it, and drinking/a work hard play hard mentality is pretty prevalent in my industry.

Got completely wasted last night with about fifteen shots of whiskey by myself just hanging out at home. Texted and called repeatedly (like five calls in a row) a couple of pretty new business acquaintances (probably would've been friends, before yesterday), one of whom I recently asked out and got politely rejected by. I sounded insane, commented on what I think about them and their lives, repeated myself, didn't make any sense, said a bunch of random shit, basically, completely embarrassed myself. I have no idea what to do, I think I will just have to make sure our paths never cross again. They probably think I'm psychotic; maybe I am psychotic because IDK what kind of person would do something like that. 

I'm hoping they don't like get a restraining order against me, or report me to the governing body of our industry, because I feel like what I did was basically harassment. 

Since I'm feeling like I've ruined my life right now and there's nothing I can do about it, the only thing I can think of to do is make this post and say that today is Day 1.",10

Been lurking for a while and I'm out of options other than quit...","Had a really bad run in with an ex of mine yesterday. Was at the store buying another bottle.

I don't really wanna talk with any in person people about what I'm thinking cause it frankly seems kinda sad. Everyone around me thinks I'm improving, and maybe I am, but i wouldn't want to disappoint them with something so petty. 

Basically, she was as beautiful as ever. On the phone  with someone, seemed like a good conversation. Thankfully she didn't recognize me since I've changed so much. 50 extra pounds, hoodie with a hood up, beard grown out. Just not a good sight to see. Maybe she did recognize me and just didn't want to say anything. I don't blame her. 

I honestly don't miss her that much. I just miss that life. The ""normal"" one. Being able to go a day, years even without drowning sorrows. I was never a particularly happy person,  but back then a monster and some games would pick me right up. Now I need a fifth of vodka to both feel anything and nothing at all. 

It just made me realize how bad it has gotten. Went and dug through some of my graduation photos from college. MAN I was a handsome mf. In shape, sober from anything other than caffeine, succeeding for the most part. I didn't know how good I had it.

Now like I said, I'm down bad. Where I was living on my own, I'm back with the parents. Where I was working for literally Microsoft, I was fired and now work at an call center. Where I normally could hold a stable relationship, I don't speak to any of my friends and haven't dated in like 2 years? How quickly it all went so wrong. Looking at the types of people I surrounded myself with then, and the types of people and activities I surround myself with now... it's really disheartening honestly. 

It all hit me kind of hard. I've never wanted to hide my face until yesterday. I've never wanted to get out of a store so fast, drive home so fast, and drink my loot so fast. I've never got ""sad drunk,"" but last night i remember just crying my eyes out looking at my past. I remember it feeling really painful.

It still feels that way. Part of my mind is running from it, and part of me wants to use it to motivate me. I don't even fit into any of my old, much more nice clothes. For over a year its been sweatpants and white t-shirts. It has to change. I'm young enough to turn it around I think, just turned 27. I can still bounce back and enjoy a happy life. I got a lot to do, and I think it all starts with quitting drinking. 

My lunch break started. I'm going to go to the break room and take a nap. Hopefully the rest of the day is as dead as I feel right now. Could really use a break.",26

When I talk about my amazing road to recovery I always try to make it very personal. I talk about how I needed to quit drinking to focus on my goals and what not but never judge anyone else for their choices. I own a catering company and provide bad services to weddings. My job is to throw parties and get people drunk and having a good time. I have a huge wine and booze cellar and am generally surrounded by it and the people who consume it. I say that because I love seeing people have a good time. My time as a drinker had just come to an end. 

But my partner tells me I still sound judgy when I talk about how far I’ve come and how well I’m doing now. I think she is projecting because she is judging herself for drinking but I want to be aware of my words. 

When I hang out with some of my old drinking buddies and they ask about my sobriety I try to downplay how awesome it is or how much better my life and career is now. Sure I hope they see how much I’ve gotten done in the last year and see me as a good example on how a life long drunk can turn things around but the last thing I want is to feel like I’m looking down on anyone.

I ended up being somewhat of a novelty at the party, with everyone wanting to come and talk to me about how I quit, why I quit, and everything that goes with it.

I could actually taste the posole, and WANTED to eat because I was actually hungry.  I did eat probably half of the cookies that were there, though.

Now it feels like I failed her. 

Before I got a job, she would play all day in the house with my first dog. They would sleep together, cuddled up with me. It was the best feeling in the world to wake up to, instead of a hangover. Once I got my job, I played with her before work and after, take her for walks, always made sure the room she was in was warm and cozy. She had been eating and drinking normally. Until this morning. I went to go check on her and give her breakfast and play with her. Except when I walked in, her dinner was untouched, she wasn’t moving. She was gone. It broke my heart. I have no idea what happened. She was only about 6 months old and had been healthy. Energetic. Nothing was out of the ordinary. I don’t know what happened and the fact that I don’t know if I did something wrong, if she got sick somehow, or what... I don’t know. I feel so guilty and I have no idea what I’m guilty about. I’ve had her since she was surrendered to me at 6 weeks old. 

I broke down and cried. I rarely cry but I couldn’t stop. I kept thinking “I need a drink, I don’t want to feel this”. I have a court hearing in two hours and I’m a mess. I don’t know what to do with her because I don’t drive and the ground is frozen. I’m calling around to see if there’s any pet cremation services who will pick her up. 

I didn’t think I would lose her. I thought if she ever left me, it would be to another home. Now I’m just in pain, wishing I could drink, wishing I didn’t want to drink, knowing that I won’t.

What I learned is that my childhood programming did not teach me communication and emotional sobriety when tension, expections, emotions, etc...... are running really high.

Looking back over the last 2 years, I can recall how it was all about the days at the start. Hard days. Long days. Questioning if this was 'forever' or a 'breather. My wife so very gently guiding me away from drinking after a month or so as we neared my work's Christmas party... I mean, I had a MONTH sober, that proved it. No sir, no alcoholic here...

Bless that woman. 

I now have weeks, and months, now years. I can take deep, calm intakes of breath and feel such genuine thankfulness to be sober, to be calm, to be a better husband and father than I ever thought, or realised, I could be.

For anyone reading this. For those hunting out words of encouragement from 'veterans', as I did, at the start of my own journey - WELL DONE. YOU'RE DOING IT. 

One day soon you can have your 2 years too. You CAN and it will be GLORIOUS. 

Sobriety delivers everything alcohol promised.

Love to you all.",319

I will never argue that drinking doesn't make everything worse, but I realized after my relapse I got into the habit of blaming \*everything\* on me drinking again. And not as an excuse, no. As, ""God I'm such a piece of shit, of course this is happening, I'm drinking again.""

To the point that my last job legitimately managed me poorly and was a toxic environment. Example: A coworker loudly mocked me for a scheduling error right after I had to put my dog to sleep. I could go on, but things like that were happening a lot. And I kind of knew it wasn't ok, but also part of me had this, ""Well, you relapsed, of course your life is shit, you deserve it"" feeling. If I'd been sober I would have felt able to address it and/or leave sooner but the environment ITSELF wasn't my fault.

It's a shower thought bc this applies to smaller things, too. Yeah, sometimes you fumble the soap bc you're drunk (if you're drinking). But sometimes that also happens sober.

I still blame myself for things that aren't my fault, that's an ongoing issue for me to deal with. But not immediately hating myself for drinking this morning, since I didn't, made me realize how bad my shame levels were and how hard that makes it to get to a place of quitting instead of just drinking more to avoid the shame.",10

I have a drinking problem, fair and square.  
There is no stopping once I start drinking.   
Even though this community shall not judge, I write this with a heavy heart.  
 

Yesterday I drank the most I have ever drank. I drank every drop of alcohol I had; it was intended to last me for 2 days. I went to sleep at 9:30 PM stupidly drunk and woke up a few hours later around 3:30 AM when the alarm clock raised its familiar tones. I was befuddled, very likely still somewhat drunk. I raised myself groaning and tried to set steady steps.  
 

I guess (beer) drinkers know these symptoms: My head was spinning, my throat was dry, I felt bloated and like a truck had driven over me, gas copiously excreting itself from any opening it could find. My balance was off, and I felt more like an acrobatic than a groggy man going down the stairs. I contemplated the drinking of yesterday’s me with ire and chugged 3 to 4 glasses of tap water, one after the other in the hopes to quench the infamous thirst.  
 

Off to work. The shame of knowing how much I drank, and the fear that people would see it in my eyes or smell it (through my mask) is something I’m all too familiar with.  
Everything feels off. You pretend that you are a normal, abiding citizen coming to work his shift.  
Yet I knew I fucked up yesterday, as so many times before.   
The last time I told myself this drinking should stop already forgotten.   
 

I managed to quit a week the last time before I told myself to celebrate with a beer, and from there it went downhill again. One beer turned into daily drinking for a little bit over a month with the climax yesterday.  
I’m fed up. I’m through with this. I don’t want to be a slave to this devilish breed no more. I want to be free from its torturing calls.  
 

Will I miss it? Sure, I will. It was my amigo in times I had no one. It was a reliever of stress in this ever-stressful family of mine.   
Its treacherous veil pulled over my eyes each night, promising less worries, but poisoning me more and more.   
Instances of threatening those around me with fouler moods and frustrated rants long after going to bed growing numerous with time. I, blissfully ignorant, forgotten what had been said the day before and wondering why the wife was mad at me… as so many times before.  
 

As to wrap up this rambling of mine, I shall conquer this addiction as I have conquered my previous addiction: smoking. Let’s go at it, cold-turkey style!

The awareness is getting tough. I am empathetic to a fault and tend to take on the stress of people that I love, which fortunately, is a lot of people (there are 8 people just in my immediate family). I am also starting to think this is another reason that I would drink. I’m feeling concerned for everyone around me, while feeling guilty that I’ve been so numb and consumed with myself over the past few years. I’m realizing how my relationships were damaged in the wake of my depressive state, and I’d be lying if I said it didn’t want to make me crawl right back into it.

Around that time, I recorded some videos of me talking about myself and my opinions (link below). Then, a few months ago, I recorded some more videos reflecting on the journey I went on. I found it so interesting just observing the difference in tone, body language, and words I used to describe myself. It showed me how much of a hold alcohol can have on your character.

The first few months were extremely difficult, but I got through it by reading all your supportive words on this sub. I think that after about 3 months, the wires in my brain started changing and I no longer had any urge to drink. It became a bit easier once I had been tested in social settings and stood strong (who knew lime and soda was such a good drink). By 12 months, the idea of drinking repulsed me. I have drunk on a few occassions since but thankfully it just doesn't do anything for me anymore, so I tend not to. I do understand that for many of you, moderation isn't an option. If that is you, don't look at the mamoth task of having to quit forever. Firstly, quit for one week, and then two and then one month, and then 3 months.  You'll be slaying dragons before you know it.

Hopefully for those of you who have trouble finding the motivation, maybe watching this can shows what alcohol does to your personality

Again, thanks everyone for the support along the journey. I never really posted anything, but I genuinely read all your posts for hours every week. Stay strong guys. There is a light at the other end of the tunnel.

He either hasn't noticed that I haven't touched alcohol in the last 44 days or he doesn't care, but either way his comment really hurt me. Partly because it's impossible for him to let the past go while I'm trying so hard to do better. Partly because of the sheer double standards that in the past couple of weeks alone he got so drunk that he rolled in to the house at about 3am and vomited in the back of the taxi, and just this Saturday he had to come home early because he'd gotten so drunk he was falling asleep. And the last partly because this has been so difficult for me and it's like he's barely even noticed the amount of times I've come home still sober from evenings out, driven myself to and from places or just missed events all together because I don't want to have the temptation.",14

I came to the realisation that drinking alcohol made my life quite misarable. I only drank every weekend on friday and saturday. 8 beers or more each night. Just browsing reddit, listening to some music or gaming alone and sometimes with friends. But I became dependant on alcohol slowely. 

I kept telling myself I had no issues, I kept telling myself I wasn't addicted because I don't need it. But not drinking friday and saturday night was/is unthinkable. Queue in the Lockdowns and working from home and my mental health went down the drains. If I had a rough week I would self medicate it with some beer and games in the weekend. I quit smoking a couple years ago so thats a plus. 

Recentrly, I got severe anxiety attacks on sundaynights, sometimes mondaynights. Issues with sleep and sleep quality in general is horrible. I'm a tired mess all week long. 

I decided I had, no, I needed to do something about this. Now, 7 days sober and even managed to get trough the weekend with no beers. But, I'm feeling worse than ever mentally. Maybe fysically even, I'm so tired.

I had some days I felt sad, alone, overwhelmed and such but could always pick myself up. This saturday I felt so down. I scared me how dark I felt. Sunday I felt better but still, overwhelmed and sad. Games would normally light up my day a little but almost had no emotion playing games I love. Today, while working, I am feeling sad and such. Empty even. 

Does this happen because I stopped drinking? Does somebody here have experience with this? I walked outside for 30minutes and feel a little better but I just feel so bad, lonely and sad. So empty. Even while I'm not alone. Even when I have a girlfriend at home and some friends.",4

We talked about the culture of drinking, how easy it is to start, etc. Last night I talked to my younger kid.

I’m trying to be candid with them without burdening them, but I know I’m also talking with them about it bc 1) it will hold me more accountable; and 2) I would like them to begin learning now about the real dangers of drinking.

Does that voice ever go away? I thought I knew the truth about alcohol/ that it’s an addictive poison with no benefits, but the brainwashing and conditioning is so deeply ingrained , if I read and article or hear something it’s like I hold on to it. 

Any help from people who have gone through this. I’ve had a year of trying to completely stop drinking but I keep going back and as soon as I creep up to drinking too much again I quit. That should be lesson enough but again these voices stay in my head

Im glad to say the last of these was yesterday and ive got them over and out the way. I drank more than i would have liked, but i remained in some state of control thankfully.

I also smoke weed daily for the past 12. I've been well aware that I have a problem, and I've been making a conscious effort to atleast not make it worse (meaning I don't drink during the week, and then always manage to convince myself that ""one"" beer won't hurt on a Friday night. Of course, one is too many and a hundred isn't enough, as I've seen written here so many times before. I am truly tired of it, I black out every time and drive home while barely managing to open my eyes. I get home (I live alone) and I start screaming and throwing shit to the ground. The next morning I try to figure out what the hell happened and how did I spend 50 bucks on a ""normal"" night. Cue the shame, guilt, promises of never drinking again... You know the drill.

Here's where it gets interesting. I am at a stage where I know I need external help. Specialized help. The weed thing is also ruining my life in different ways. The thing is... I'm a psychologist. I finished my master's this year, after being an intern at a (you guessed it) rehab center. It's the only one in my town, and I had about 200 sessions as a therapist. I can't ask for help there, as I personally know every professional who works there. Even if that were possible, the thought of sitting in the waiting room with people I've given therapy to... 

The thing is, I really need this. I give up trying to do it on my own. I will accept any medication a psychiatrist gives me, for the first time. I've been prescribed benzos, antidepressants and antipsychotic medication, but my younger self would tell them to fuck off (in a polite manner lol). This time, I don't give a shit. I'm tired of living like this. If I ever want to be a therapist, I need to solve this shit first. 

I don't know if anyone's ever been in a similar situation, but what should I do? This rehab center is state-owned, so it's free. I can't afford my own private therapist (I've done it for the past 5 years and no more). They have the best addiction specialists in my country. What the hell do I do? :(((",16

Today I'm celebrating 6 months sober and I thought I'd write down things that have helped me. 

1. **Remembering my reasons for not drinking**: this is a list with some reasons that may seem pretty obvious (e.g. better sleep, waking up sober, having more energy) and some very personal reasons (especially positive effects in the relationship with my SO, which previously was affected more than I was willing to admit). Going through these reasons every now and then makes sure that I don't take good things for granted. 
2. **Thinking of my drinking time as a video game that I finished playing**: I tried moderation, and it just didn't work for me. I knew that I needed to stop for good. At first, I was scared shitless of never ever being able to drink alcohol again. Then I thought of it like a video game: It was fun while it lasted, and while I'll keep some fond memories, playing it again is never going to feel the same anyway. I’m done with it. 
3. **Working on friendships I care about**: I was also afraid that I'd lose my best friends by changing my habits. Turns out, some of them may have been drinking buddies but not really close friends. They still think I’m just going through a phase and we mostly lost interest in each other. No big deal. Others are more supportive than I’ve ever imagined them to be, this helped a lot! Also, reconnecting with old friends I haven't seen in years is something I genuinely enjoyed and now I'm working on keeping these friendships active.  
4. **Still rewarding myself**: I realized that after a long day of work, a ritual really helps me to unwind. It was never about the alcohol. Preparing a healthy smoothie, a virgin cocktail and trying out various spices gets my head free. Also the money I spent for alcohol, I'm using right now to buy good quality food and my body feels fantastic. Btw, a back pain I had for years disappeared after 2 months sober and honestly this alone is worth stopping. 
5. **Staying in this group**! Even when I thought I didn't need this group any more, reading everyone's thoughts, feelings, success stories and also mistakes helped me in being prepared of what's to come when going alcohol free. 

Wishing you all the best out there, stay strong!

I am SO grateful for everything you do.

In this supportive, safety oriented community, we encourage each other to seek immediate help if we are afraid for our safety, and often that means going to an emergency room. 

The few times I have been to the emergency department, scared for my life due to alcohol or other mental health issues, I have been treated with disgust, rolled eyes and contempt. 

I have brushed off these experiences as the staff being overworked and underpaid (which they are). But I discovered multiple expose style newspaper articles quoting doctors essentially shaming any alcohol related visits. 

This excerpt in particular horrified me:

""They are at risk of choking on vomit. They can't control themselves, they can't stand up, they have been in the gutter lying on the streets.""

Often staff would make the person clean up the sick, but most of the time they were too drunk to do it.”

I understand that it is frustrating to treat people who have seemingly put themselves in danger willingly, but there are so many of us who are doing everything we can to get better.

I wanted to let all you who are struggling with the concept of quitting alcohol or just starting the journey, it gets easier. 

I am currently on day 252 of my sobriety. Something I thought was impossible after 7 years of drinking myself to death almost every day. It has now gotten to the point where I hardly keep track as the weeks go by. It feels like a huge weight off my shoulders, that I am truly becoming a better version of myself. 

Social gatherings get easier. Temptations or dreams of drinking fade away after time. Emotions become easier to deal with because you aren't poisoning yourself every day. All that money that you'd waste on alcohol can be used on things to improve your life, instead of destroying it. The support systems such as family and friends, who stuck by you through your tribulations, will  become even more meaningful. To be honest, life is more meaningful as a whole without alcohol in it to mess everything up. 

To whoever is reading this and needs words of encouragement, I believe in you. I know it seems impossible to contemplate sometimes, but you can do it. Take it day by day. It will get easier, I promise you. Days will fade into weeks, weeks into months, and inevitably into years. Just allow yourself to take the initial steps, whatever they may be.",41

Or that it makes me fat, or that it robs me of athletic performance in some of my hobbies. I don't like that OTHER people drinking makes me uncomfortable (and how hypocritical is that???). I don't like what it has done to my family (my mom is an alcoholic) and that, despite that pain and hatred for it, I have a hard time stopping. I have put it down for months at a time before, but nothing sticks. And I'm getting to the place where I realize that I WILL end up being a person I hate if I don't stop. I don't really know that I can change my relationship with it for the better, I don't have the kind of self-control around it that I wish I DID have. More and more over the last 10 years it has become a crutch and a near-daily occurrence. 

Every time I drink I regret it, even if nothing that crazy happens. I haven't lost a job, or gotten a DUI, or harmed anyone (other than myself). I don't get the shakes if I don't drink. I just don't like that it's a part of my life, and I don't like that it feels more and more like it's SLOWLY getting control of me, or being a part of my identity or something. It's hard to put into words. And I have days where I have a lot of resolve, and then the sneaky bastard goes ""Eh, one beer won't hurt"" and I have a beer, and think, ""This is nice, why would I stop?"". 

I'm scared of giving it up because of how ingrained in so many things it is, but I feel I need to. Maybe I should find a group. Maybe I need to read some more books about it. Idk. Thanks for reading, I'm pretty frustrated with drinking/myself at the moment. Think it's time to make a change.",4

2021-11-22 03:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qzgjw6/frustrated_not_defeated/,"Frustrated, not defeated.","I've been making significant progress since June to remove alcohol from my life best I can. In the months since I've had two slip ups, one being yesterday. So a total of around 5 months of sobriety with two slip ups. I take issue with people ""resetting the clock"" as it encourages defeatism and a descent back into hell so I won't reset my personal timer. Just place a couple hash marks next to it. I've had a wonderful time sober and to be honest I've completely replaced it in my life. 

But I am frustrated. I'm not really beating up on myself. Shit happens, you slip under pressure. Indeed, I did. But the pressure wasn't the usual pressure. It was almost prescribed at a party we had planned. Over the last 5 months I've been opening up with more people that I have had a problem drinking. Of course, I get the usual. ""You're not an alcoholic just cut back"", etc. I have found it difficult to completely articulate that I can feel a very different feeling than most people w.r.t. alcohol and just because I'm not a handle-a-day (or handle-a-week) drinker it does not mean I don't have a problem. My liver panels have been normal but other things, such as blood sugar and cholesterol have trended up. 5 or so years of heavy-ish drinking have done some damage, certainly, but stopping now means I can avoid dying young or at the very least being crippled.

As stupid as it is yesterday I justified everything as ""I will only have 3"". Well, 3 turned into 6 over a night. I cannot keep to my boundaries but can apparently stop. Further demonstrating to myself the last 5 month long exercise needs to be permanent. 

Shockingly one of the people who has been on the ""you're not an alcoholic"" train saw this, and despite me saying ""see what I mean?"", they are insistent that I still don't have a problem. Removing this person from my life is not possible - it's my wife. I have no idea how to deal with this anymore. All other roadblocks have been cleared. I've kept my good friends, gotten wonderful support from my father (who himself has a problem with alcohol), and learned a lot from some friends I didn't know were addicts themselves. But my wife is a factor I do not know how to control for. It's not a situation I can remove myself from and without becoming a righteously indignant teetotaler and raising my voice - I'm not sure what else can be done. I suppose if my aim is to make 2022 a year of sobriety I will need to become extremely insistent. I don't look forward to the fights. But it truly is a fight for my life and one I need to devote some time into strategizing for.

At any rate this is just bitching as I have no where else to complain to. I am clearly strong enough to do this, and I just need to get better at saying no. Who would've thought two letters would be the difference between success and failure.",4

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Having compassion starts and ends with having compassion for all those unwanted parts of ourselves. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy. – Pema Chodron

Friends, I've been thinking a lot about self compassion lately. It all started with a guided meditation I did recently with the theme of self compassion, which I enjoyed although I was, as per usual, about half asleep by the end of it.

I don't know about you, but I haven't had a lot of compassion for myself in my life. I try to ""be real."" I try to own up to my mistakes and flaws and failures. And that's all good, I think. But what I usually forget to add is the kindness and grace and understanding that I would offer anyone else if they were to tell me ""I suffer from addiction."" ""I made mistakes."" ""I feel terrible."" If I sat with any of you and you told me your story, I wouldn't berate you or beat you over the head with your mistakes. I would offer you my friendship and compassion. And yet, I have struggled to offer that same affection and love to myself.

But here is a secret that it sometimes feels like the world is trying to beat out of you (aka me.) You (I) are just as worthy of love and kindness and compassion as anyone else. And I think that maybe if we show ourselves that love and compassion, it makes it that much easier for us to be open and empathetic with others as well. 

And so today, I want to ask you to join me in showing yourself the same loving care that you would show a friend or a partner or a child who is or had been in pain. If you find yourself speaking very negatively about yourself, question if you would speak to someone else that way. And if not, what would you say instead?

Good morning SD! IWNDWYT ❤️",292

I have been working with myself and not against myself for a little while now.. learning about how simple things can be if I let life unfold as it may.

Simple choices.. those countless seemingly unimportant decisions we make daily..do make up our lives. But Let's not forget how far we have come today.

Hope everyone had a one of a kind weekend and wakes up Monday morning feeling fresh! No doom, no gloom..instead hello peace and comfort.

It all started when they made a joke about how their fridge was totally filled with beer. They'd bought two things of it, and their roommate bought two things of it as well, and so there was a lot of beer in the fridge. It was an innocuous joke. But it took made back to the days when I had more alcohol in my fridge and pantry than food. That was my priority to stock up on, especially with the pandemic-induced mindset of preparing for the worst, and food became an afterthought for me. And I missed when alcohol was that available to me.

I was dealing with awful cravings to drink. I just kind of withdrew. I would not call it passive aggressiveness--I didn't snap at my partner or try to communicate anything with my behavior, but I just needed to expend a ton of mental energy on fighting the craving to drink. It took me out of the moment and I wasn't as engaged. All I could think about was how much I missed drinking.

My partner was upset upon finding out I was feeling triggered and that's why I was ""off."" They said they'd rather have a hard boundary not to discuss it rather than ""walk on eggshells"" around me in discussing it. I personally feel it's obvious what kinds of comments would be triggering or upsetting to me, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that it's not intuitive to them.

I don't want to engage in total avoidance of the subject forever, but for now, I guess I am fine with not hearing about drinking from the person who I wish I could drink with the most.

Does anyone else prefer to avoid discussions of alcohol use entirely? I know I'm more sensitive than the vast majority, but I'm curious if there's anyone out there like me, who's really sensitive to the topic. Or if anyone has opinions on this type of coping mechanism.",4

This is making my life a mess and making it a struggle to balance my studies, sporting commitments and quality time with my partner.
They first cut my hours to a point where I couldn't pay the rent let alone feed myself.
Then after a renegotiation they put me on 6 out of every 7 days a week.
This was making things a pain  for obvious reasons.
But I still made my time for studying and sporting commitment and time with my partner, it just meant I was physically exhausted all the time.

Then comes Today.

Today I just found out I got a new job in the tech industry and that all my studying was not in vain.
I'm going to be earning significantly more money and working far better hours and I cannot be more happy.
Today is the best day of my life and I attribute a lot of that to my ongoing efforts toward sobriety.
I will have more time for my hobbies, studies and my family.
I no longer have to worry about being able to pay rent and bills and putting money down on my house deposit.

I got so bored of the smashed weekends and recovery during the first couple of days of the working week. The night sweats, the irritability, the inability to focus, that feeling constant thirst, the whacking headache - I have moved to a longer cycle of 1-2 months followed by a slide and realization that I wasn’t getting anything out of booze (again!h) and then a difficult week to sober week and then a few weeks of a calmer and more productive and Rested me. Why then having done that cycle so many times am I unable to commit to never drinking ? The idea  that I want have dinner in some restaurant with a wine list or Xmas champagne is too much to give up. I have some counseling and the advice is not to worry about that and to just be kind to myself and enjoy being sober now and indulge myself with that sobriety and just keep comparing new and old until the sense in my core takes hold that this is a better way to be. We have a works function coming up - it’s an afternoon of boozing - an expat British brunch - a road crash. I am already sad about missing out in the fun ? What fun ? If probably get drunk and upset someone or wake up at 3 am on my sofa with a half eaten takeaway and wine stains on my nice trousers - worse still a disciplinary to face at work (been there and I am a boss), an upset wife who I have rung and blamed for everything, an Unwalked dog , bad food - bad sleep. I need to plan ahead and slay these events which are nothing more than excuses fo out an addictive substance that is not good for me back in my bloodstream as if there are no consequences. I am on anti depressants , I am overweight , statins, monitoring for high blood pressure  and liver damage and still I think I should complete the longest suicide attempt. I know of people long gone at 40 through drink, 30 and 20. And still I think it’s a good option - Why ? Until I figure out that desire to to start again I need to be super careful - at least I can start and catch it quickly - but it isn’t moderation - it’s a high risk.

Hopefully it hasn't set me back too far, but I'm back at day 1. I'm hoping I'll be stronger this time and be able to push through the difficult times. I really want to see what happens after the 1 month mark, and I'm looking forward to it.

This morning I got up early and enjoyed my coffee. Later after everyone else awoke. I  made bacon, pancakes and eggs to order.  It was a super fun night and I am now pretty confident in my ability to not drink. I will always be on my guard though as I know how easy to think that I could drink and be ok.

For anyone who hasn't seen it, it's basically the rise of OxyContin in the 90s/early 2000s and how the pharma company lied about its addictiveness and also shows how a small town was affected by it. It was really good.

While I've never gotten addicted to opioids, I have with alcohol. I thought the show did a really good job at portraying addiction. When people are coming down from the high, the cold sweats, anxiousness, pacing, insomnia, skin crawling, etc. a lot of people, I'll call them ""normies"" have never experienced feeling like you're going to die unless you have the next drink or drug. It took me back to those first few days of alcohol withdrawal, knowing in the back of my head a couple of drinks would take away the pain. There was also a scene where Michael Keaton who becomes addicted describes why relapses happen. Often times he says ""it's to get rid of the pain and to feel numb"". I definitely feel at my weakest against my addiction when I'm experience a lot of mental pain. I know a drink will help, but I've also tried it countless times and it leads me to a worse position than before.

The other night at dinner my parents had wine, then after dinner they proceeded to drink even more, separately. They literally spent the rest of the night getting progressively more drunk just on their own. My dads eyes were glassy and my mom was rambling. It was pathetic. Tonight we had a big dinner with more family and my mom just kept pouring wine and started rambling away again. It gives me so much anxiety. Luckily it hasn’t made me want to drink (if anything it has the opposite effect) but they really get under my skin. I retreated to my room early and now I felt guilty for thinking so negatively of my parents. I feel like they can tell I get annoyed with them, and I feel bad about that. I feel bad for them, they’re stuck in their old ways and can’t seem to change. They don’t have the best relationship and I feel badly for my mom and angry at my dad but also bad for him. I don’t know why I’m writing this all here, I guess this isn’t something I feel I can share with anyone else. I guess it’s no surprise I’ve had such a bad relationship with alcohol in the last, looking at my parents. I want to be kinder to them, I hope I can be.

Like many families we have managed to stay close as we get older by getting together and spending long weekend afternoons enjoying our time together…heavily lubricated.

My decision to stop drinking just under a year ago was a surprise to them, but they’ve always been supportive though largely silent about it. I for sure have never made my issue be about anyone other than me, nor have I expected anyone to act differently on my behalf.

So when everyone showed up to the party without booze in tow and I slowly figured out that they all weren’t going to drink I was overcome with anxiety.  I felt like a small animal backed into a corner by a predator.  I was on display but nobody was verbally acknowledging it.

Now, deep down I know this was an act of love.  And now that it’s over I appreciate that.  But my body initially took it as an act of war.  I thought about the conversations that had to happen to lead up to this.  What conversations have they had in the last year? and what were they saying about me?  cause they sure as shit haven’t said anything to me.

It was surreal, and in truth I hated it.  It made me feel weak, when as I approach 1 year I was feeling really strong.

This morning they were incredibly hungover and asked if we could just order food, chill, and watch movies. And you know what? I realized how nice that sounded, and that part of me missed being hungover… not for the horrible physical and mental feeling of it, of course, but because it’s a great excuse to stay in and just. Do. Nothing. Like a snow day when you’re a kid, or when your in-flight internet dies and you can’t work on a plane. 

So I gave in and played hungover with them: I napped, didn’t clean up or do laundry, watched way too many bad movies, and ordered greasy food. It felt so indulgent and weirdly restorative. I realized so much of my sobriety has been about doing more, which is awesome — I wake up earlier, exercise more, spend more quality time with friends and family — but it’s also important sometimes to do absolutely nothing.

Not letting alcohol take my dreams or goals away from me.,"I’ve been sober curious for this past year. I’m in my late 20s and have a successful career. I’ve never “had a problem” so to speak but I think a small problem is one worth cutting out. 

This year i started a new job and have been killing it lately. Part of that has been due to starting to run and honestly I think quitting drinking. I’ve not been a mess but I’ve been fat, somewhat depressed and not on top of my game. Ive felt on top of my game the last few weeks. 

I would usually drink most days…never a lot but a beer or two. And most weekends I’d drink. I’ve been experimenting with going a week or so and not drinking. 

Last night though I went out with some friends to the club. I was hammered and the club was loud. I worry about damaging my hearing being in those places. 

This morning is the usual after a night out. I wake up nauseous and with the WORST hangxiety. All day I feel on edge and just filled with general worry about everything in life. The weather has been dark and cloudy and cold and that doesn’t help. I’d been doing so well with anxiety while exercising and not drinking. Today I feel like crying almost.  

I think I’m nearly there. It’s getting easier and easier for me to not drink. I honestly feel like drinking is holding me back from being happy and successful. I can’t make that trade anymore. I’m done. I don’t know for how long but all I have to do is focus on today…and tomorrow on that day. 

I can’t wait for this feeling of doom and worry to fall away as I get back to my goals. 

I enjoy writing, it helps me get clear with my thoughts and lift a weight off my shoulders. I’ll get drunk and write in my notes app how bad I hate drinking before falling asleep. I wake up and read it and agree and I think that’s helped me realize to take care of myself. 

Thank you for letting me rant. I will not drink today. Tomorrow will be bright and full of opportunity to crush our goals and lift one another up!

I will not drink with you all!",16

245 days ago I woke up feeling like shit, doing any basic task was incredibly difficult and I just hated being awake the entire time, prior to this I had spent the entire night(from around 10pm to 7am) drinking with someone and what was supposed to be a fun night ended with someone yelling at me for whatever reason came up. After recovering from what happened I asked myself ""Why did I do this?"" I'm in my 20s and drinking alcohol always felt like a part of socializing and after giving it some thought I realized that most of the times I've drank was due to social pressure to do so, you know not standing out by being that person that isn't drinking, that person that isn't having fun or whatever.

My experience with alcohol prior to this wasn't the healthiest either, I would pretty much accept whatever drink people gave me and it'd seemed like people wanted to get me drunk asap for whatever reason.

So after all this I decided to stop drinking at least till the end of the year, when telling people at parties or any other social gathering that I'm no longer drinking I would hear things like ""Oh come on, you used to be more fun before"", ""One little drink isn't gonna hurt you"" or ""When are you drinking again?"". I've found some people to be surprisingly insistent on this.

To be honest one of the reasons I'm sharing this is a bit selfish, even though I've told multiple people about this none of them seem to be really supportive about it or seemed happy for me, so I guess I'm looking for that here.",9

Without alcohol, I have a hard time sleeping because I’m hypersensitive to any movement my poor husband makes even to the point where I’m imagining that he’s moving… so weird. I’m starting to wonder if this is some sort of alcohol withdrawal induced hallucination? Anyway, for my stress and anxiety and a great many other reasons I am going to try to not drink once again. I’m not sure for how long, but I’m curious to see how my life improves and in what ways. I am scared about feeling my feelings but I think this is a change I need to make. I at least need to try.

I obviously don’t want that, I want to make a conscious decision to never drink again but I get so bored being sober because my drinking ruined all the parts of my life that gave me meaning/purpose, so my stupid addict brain tells me there’s nothing left and that it’s easier to just get drunk so I don’t have to think about how pathetic my life has become.",29

A few days ago I hit a new low point, and after having thought I had hit my bottom several times before, at this point the demoralization hit a new level. I'm sure some people have been there. There can indeed be a trap door that takes you even lower.

I went through the worst of sobering up... (yet again.) The withdrawals, DTs, insane thinking, the beating myself up, the hopelessness... That first night was completely unbearable, so I'm writing this for people in that timeframe. If you stick with it, it doesn't last forever. In my case probably one of the main reasons I haven't had a drink is because I've been at rehab and literally can't, so I pray for people who can. The first stages of withdrawal can be really really hard if you're a heavy drinker like myself.

Right now while I've still got a bit of headache and queasiness, the worst of the physical sickness is over, but the emotional hardship continues. This is hard work and will continue to be but today I'm not drinking and it does get a little easier with time. It helps me to remind myself of what I'm grateful for. Thanks for reading",8

I was never a daily drinker, in fact I usually only drank once a week, maybe once every other week.  My problem was always binge drinking - I could never have just one, I’d usually black out and hubby was about ready to leave me.  The last time I drank I thought I was literally going to die the next day.  My heart was racing so fast, sweating, overthinking, guilt, etc.  I promised myself, and him, I’d quit for good. 

The first couple weeks were liberating and I accepted that “well, this is my new life now, let’s make the best of it!” I do see the upsides of not being hungover, not fighting in my relationship, not feeling guilty for being useless the next day.  But in all transparency I am really, really, fucking bored and unhappy. 

I’ve tried hobbies.  I signed up for a kickboxing class with my sister. I try to stay busy getting my nails done, shopping, cooking and all that fun stuff in my spare time.  But the social aspect of my life just feels like something is missing. 

I cut off most of my friends as our social outings consisted of wine which turned into shots and so forth.  Even when I do go out, I can’t help but think how much more fun it would be with drinking.  Nothing really excites me anymore and don’t even get me started on going out to dinner.  Ordering non alcoholic drinks sucks and I always wish and think I’d absolutely love a glass of wine. 

I’m 30 and I see my friends doing all these fun things and drinking and honestly I’m jealous.  This summer hubby and I went jet skiing, stayed weekends at multiple air b&b’s in beautiful city’s, hiking, zip lining, restaurants etc .. but every.  Single.  Outing. I craved a drink before or after.  It’s like I’m in a constant downer mood knowing I have to live life sober and no matter how hard I try to distract myself I’m never truly happy.  If I’m being honest sobriety has taken any excitement out of doing things for me.  I’m so grateful for my life and the fun things I get to do, but when I’m doing them I really am not happy.  I feel like I’m living as an imposter, saying how lucky I am and how great my summer was but really, deep down I was super indifferent.  I’m struggling.  I’m tired of hearing I need therapy, hobbies, exersize, things I’ve done and had this entire time.  I feel I try so hard to “fake it til I make it” and believe we can train our minds to make the choice for the type of day we’re going to have.  I practise meditation and mindfulness.  Still I feel empty. 

I guess I’m just venting, but I salute you all for your efforts in sobriety and hope you are all finding happiness!",30

Spouses are welcome, and I'd love to introduce everyone to my husband....I want to be a part of this so bad...but I don't think I can.... and it's really bothering me. I feel so frustrated.  

I hear it in the halls, co-workers joking about the party to come. ""Let's get drunk!!"" They say... much of the banter I've been hearing...previous gatherings have gotten wild.  Lots of drinking and alcohol a plenty. People going in with the expectation of leaving drunk... I think I could go and say no thank you all night, maybe I'd never have to mention I don't drink...but maybe I will. Are they going to question why?? Maybe one (or worse, more) of my coworkers is like I used to be and won't take no for an answer...I honestly don't know if I could resist in the moment. I don't know if I have the strength to say no all night long. What if someone just hands me a shot...or grabs me a drink out of ""kindness""...I hate alcohol and I hate that I have a problem with it...

Don't get me wrong,  I love being sober and all the positives that my sobriety has brought...but I still have resentment.  So many things running through my mind. Why is this such a difficult decision...?! I know deep down that I really shouldn't attend this event...it's too dangerous. And the fact that I keep going back and forth trying to make some plan in my head for every instance someone says want a drink? Why aren't you drinking?? Blah blah blah... maybe I could do it. Maybe I am strong enough.  But maybe I'm not.

Guess I just wanted to vent to you all. Please share if you're having similar issues with all the upcoming holiday events. I really need you guys right now. I am so thankful to have you. Feeling pretty bummed I have to miss my first Christmas party with this company, and hearing how these festivities apparently go, probably all future parties.... Spoke to my SO and we're planning a nice evening out so I can still get all dressed up, just the two of us, minus the hoards of booze. Sounds really wonderful, but it still won't be the party I long to attend...

I am so grateful.

Thank you everyone who is brave enough to come share their stories and be honest with some internet strangers. Somehow knowing we are not alone in this is such a help. Most alcoholics I know are good people who got caught up with this thing and everyone should understand that we are not to blame. No need to be ashamed of ourselves or soak in self loathing.  This is a realization I finally had. You see, we have been targeted by billions of dollars in advertising, a cultural paradigm that celebrates inebriation, a lack of education on the reality of alcohol or how to deal with emotion’s, stress, and mental health…..  just to name a few catalyst.  We are thought that alcohols is the solution. And for some of us… well here we are.  I will not drink today no matter how strongly my subconscious nudges me to do so. Today alcohol is not an option.

Been lurking on this forum for a few weeks and honestly the stories I see here inspire me.

I don't have a really sad background or anything, I was an only child and grew up in the country. Started smoking when I was 20 and actually waited until I was 21 to have my first drink. The first month or two I tore it up and made my early mistakes. Got found laying naked in the bathroom, black out drunk once by my parents and that made for a fun morning after.

It wasn't long and I switched to drinking beer. 5.9% by volume. At first a 6 pack would mess me up and I drank every 2 or 3 days. Next thing you know I'm drinking that much daily. Things got significantly worse after my mother passed away of brain cancer, where I'd drink as much as I could. Sometimes a 12 or 15 pack could disappear in a single sitting. Most days were still just a 6 pack, but if I had the night off (3rd shift) I'd go back for more. 

Moving out of the country into a small town also gave me new opportunities to drink more and neglect even more in life. Why go shopping today when I could just order food? Why get my oil changed today? It only takes like 15 minutes, I had a rough shift, I'll do it tomorrow. Excuse after excuse to avoid doing anything besides tossing a 6 pack back and passing out for the day. I'd even justify it to the people I work with by saying it helped me sleep, knowing that I was lying.

I'll be 26 in just a couple weeks, and I can hardly believe I've spent so much time drunk. I've been trying to quit for a while, relapsing every couple of days. I'd go out and buy beer without even thinking about it, not hardly even realizing what I was doing until I was a couple beers deep. Even as I'd be finishing drinking, I'd be planning out when I'd go out and get more the next day.

Last night, I decided enough was enough. I'm tired of it, and frankly plain disgusted by it. I have a problem and I really want to solve it.",5

Sorry for the long post but I'm hoping it's worth it for some!

**Background:** About a year ago, I got into a bad car accident. Alcohol wasn't involved, but it was my fault and two cars were totaled. Ironically, I was on my way to the grocery store - where I was very excited to pick up some more wine. Thankfully nobody was harmed in the crash, but my already alcohol-dependent self was sent into a tailspin as I began reckoning with what I had done, what could have happened, reliving the moment of impact and sounds, etc... From late November 2020 through January 2021 I was drinking pretty much non-stop. One day I woke up with sharp pains in my right side and a hard sensation in my abdomen - I got checked out by a Dr who almost immediately asked if I was a heavy drinker. When I hesitated to answer he looked me in the eye and said ""you need to stop. right now.""

**Where I am now:** From that January date forward, I stopped cold. It's crazy what a little bit of fear and professional intervention can do to your behaviors... I got some tests done and I'm fully healthy, but that moment in the Dr's office was a wake-up call. Now, almost a year later, I'm in the best shape of my life, my professional career has flourished, my long-term relationship is in the best place it's ever been, and my mind is so much calmer and clearer.

&#x200B;

**My learnings along the way:**

* **Exercise:** Very early on I started to realize that one of the only ways to suppress a strong craving was to absolutely exhaust myself via exercise. I am a very anxious person, so whenever I'd face the slightest setback or negative thought, I would begin craving my typical coping mechanisms. I started running religiously (I was never really a runner), and I also started to lift weights with some barbells I got at a secondhand equipment shop. Not only did it help suppress cravings, but my sleep also improved, and within a few weeks I started seeing some promising results - my face became less puffy, my acne cleared (and thank god because I'm in my late 20s...), and I started to put some muscle on my string bean arms. Now I am reaching a level where I could probably be described as ""jacked"" - the dopamine rush you get when you look into the mirror and you're *satisfied* with what you see...man, it's crazy.

&#x200B;

* **Brain fog:** Like many have mentioned in this subreddit, the brainfog you get hit with in the first several weeks of sobriety is very real. Your brain is literally rewiring itself - your rewards system is getting a complete overhaul, your mind is usually all over the place as you try to confront life's problems, and you're withdrawing from a powerful substance that has shown to lower brain function by orders of magnitude over time. I dealt with this a few ways:
   * **Consistent bedtimes/wake ups:** try to go to bed every night, and wake up every morning (including weekends) at the *same time*. This regularity was huge for me, and I tried to get 7.5 hours every night if possible. Your brain makes the most progress on healing/recovering while you're asleep, and this consistency can be so helpful.
   * **Vitamins:** After reading up on some of the vitamin deficiencies alcoholics tend to have, I began a regimen of daily vitamins that I think really helped me with initial sobriety and brainfog. I took the following:
      * Vitamin B1 - thiamine (vitamin B1) is a chemical that most alcoholics are deficient in
      * Vitamin D - I started my sobriety journey in the winter, so I started to take Vitamin D to make up for the lack of sunlight
      * Fish oil - Fish oil not only helped my skin and hair, but it was recommended for increased mental acuity and also reducing liver fats
      * Fiber - I cannot stress this one enough - you are probably already deficient in fiber as is, but with alcohol you are really doing a number on your GI and ""transit"" consistency. Take fiber so you can encourage erm...movements...sobriety is a big change and sometimes your digestion changes!
      * Probiotic - Similar to the above, alcohol does quite the number on your gut flora...you have most likely wiped out a good number of gut bacteria species that help aid digestion, metabolism, etc. Probiotics help restore this!

&#x200B;

* **Social life:** Starting my sobriety journey during lockdowns was a double-edged sword. On the one hand, I did not have to encounter many of the typical social pressures that are placed on you to drink...but on the other hand, my barriers to drinking were drastically lowered as it was almost always available within the homes I was staying in. The first thing you need to do is get an ally - mine was my gf of 7 years. I told her very candidly that I was trying to make a change, and I explained why I think I needed to do it and how I thought it would improve both of our lives...lucky for me she is amazing and was incredibly supportive. For other relatives, friends, and eventually coworkers I started to see more often in the spring, I simply said I was trying something new and was enjoying the benefits so far. I did not elaborate further, and to be honest, most people have the social tact to not pry further.  I made sure my fridge was stocked with NA options (Atheltic Brewing is simply amazing), and at larger gatherings in the summer I would order a tonic and lime or a diet soda to have something on hand for cheers-ing and socializing. I was so nervous about moments like these, but after a few tries they get soooo much easier.

&#x200B;

Unlike last year, I'm so excited for this holiday season - seeing family (safely), eating delicious food, and continuing to learn about myself and get stronger...these are all things that just weren't achievable for me last year in my rock bottom moment. If you're reading this and you feel like you're near your ""bottom"", or you're dreading the holidays and what that could bring in terms of drinking pressures, negative thoughts, etc... please get active in this community and engage with us. My DMs are always open to talk - I'm here for you and it would give me so much joy to be an outlet for you and help you along your journey.

I know the holidays bring a lot of challenges and triggers of different kinds to a lot of people who are in recovery. This will be my second sober holiday season. Last year I was introduced to the idea of creating a relapse prevention plan for the holidays and it really helped me get through it, so I wanted to share some resources to help you create your own.

[Relapse prevention worksheet](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/relapse-prevention-plan)

[Relapse prevention worksheet version 2](https://www.therapistaid.com/therapy-worksheet/relapse-prevention-plan-2)

The goal here is to identify some potential triggers you may face before you face them, identify some warning signs that you may be approaching a relapse, and plan in advance what steps you will take if and when those scenarios come up. I highly recommend doing this, putting some time into it, and sticking to your plan when the holidays come around. Y'all got this! IWNDWYT",15

I don't know if I've ever done a full post. I post on Reddit a fair amount and am usually not nice to people because I have a tough time processing my anxious responses with the slight amount of anonymity the internet gives you. That said, I have been struggling this week and no longer am in counseling and don't really feel like many in my inner circle will understand. I need ears, or eyes, and you all are always the best people to turn to when I'm in a tough spot. 

It puts me near tears to think how much I owe the support I've found in all your words. You are rocks. I admire each and every one of you who meets every day and fights a tough choice, even those who lose the fight and find a way to go back and sign up for another fight next day. Thank you all. I have been on this sub for much longer than my number (I'm not flaired, I don't think, but my # is in my title) and have relapsed four separate times, but this is my longest and steadiest wagon ride to date.

That's right, I'm strong in the face of a drink. I don't need one. And that feels amazing. But I'm still struggling. I'm struggling with the long term effects my anxiety and then my drinking which was a product of those other issues is still having on my life day in and day out. I'm reaping the harvest of the seeds I sowed when I was someone else. I'm digging up the product of all that soured labor and realizing that I have no taste for that today, that I'll have to make the best and choke it down and plant something more healthy in my garden, something that will struggle to grow in the coming long winter.

Maybe it will flourish and life will turn out well fed. Maybe it will rot on the icy vine. But today is one of those days where I don't know what I need to do to help my chances. Do I fertilize? Turn earth? Dig deeper? Find new fruits?

Sorry for the long metaphor. Not great at being short to the point, ever, with anything. What I'm asking is: what do you all do when you are faced with the challenge of eating today what you laid out so, so long ago when you were someone else? How do you ask others to keep faith in you when maybe you don't deserve it? And where do you turn when you need help to keep asking? 

Hope I'm making sense and not rambling today. And for those out there who need a word from time to time and think someone with lots of faults could help, I can't promise anything, but I can promise iwndwyt.

Im also youngish (30) living in major cities with no kids, so naturally nightlife and alcohol are integral in my social groups.

I’ve been sober over 2 years now and during this time I’ve tried over and over to defy societies expectations and go out to parties and bars anyway. Partly
for work and partly because I don’t want to leave the social groups behind. 

Some nights were successful and I have had great dancing experiences despite feeling tiredness. I figure if I keep practicing and exposing myself to these spaces, I will eventually feel comfortable and empowered to enjoy it genuinely without booze. 

Last night wasn’t successful. I was planning to go to a house music club night in LA for some networking/dancing, and the pre-party was at a ‘natural wine bar.’

I’m gonna say it - some of the most annoying people are natural wine people. Natural wine is a marketing hoax that comes round every so often in the wine industry and the people into it believe it’s somewhat superior or even good for you… ugh

Anyways. Normally I am strong enough to get through these situations but last night I broke down. All there was on the menu was wine (my old drink of choice) and it all felt *so unfair.*

I felt out of place and stupid. Why do I even try to participate? These places are literally designed to exclude me. 

If I’m being honest, I miss the tribes formed around wine and wine bars. I used to be a leader in that social group. 

I broke down in some tears outside the bar. It got me thinking maybe I should start trying to moderate drinking again… for the sake of my work and social life. I know- dangerous thinking.

Anyways I just needed to share. I know most just give up on nightlife, but I like a challenge and want to be a force of change in nightlife and music. But right now I feel like changing careers or starting drinking again.

I can't give that thought much headspace because, from experience, I know how much that bugger likes to drive this ole train.  So I read post after post, reiterating why I do not WANT to take that first drink. I really don't. *But I do*.   


That niggling thought is a beast that I know most of you with time under your belts understand. From everything I've read and learned, I think I must still believe somewhere deep inside me that alcohol has some benefit. And THAT is the beast I need to kill.  


My husband and I upended our lives in the USA and moved to a remote Caribbean island seven months ago. Some thought my sobriety would be threatened by this move because, of course, ""everyone drinks there."" 

Well, everyone drinks **everywhere,** it seems these days, right? Learning to live this new life has brought so much joy and peace into our lives and was the right move at the right time. We live in a very secluded piece of the island where it would take me nearly an hour's drive even to find a bottle. Outside of a grocery store here, I'm not even sure who sells the stuff. It seems the most significant drinking here happens in the bars, and I'm more of a hermit than a bar babe these days. 

Instead of my daily focus being when do I start drinking, do I have to go buy more today, how can I plan this out so that I don't run out until morning (when I'm relatively sober enough to drive to the store AFTER my husband leaves for work), omg WHAT did I say and do yesterday/last night . . . . 

. . . . . I am loving a life full of all sober moments. No checking activity logs, making apologies or having regrets.

I was fortunate this time that my husband quit his two 16-ounce beers a night habit, right along with my dawn-to-dusk wine habit. 

Other times I attempted to quit it was too easy for me to drink one of his, even though beer was not my preferred drink. Any will do in a pinch though, right? Not having any alcohol in the house must have been key in my recovery process because - well, a year!

So, here we are. 11/30/2020 was the first day of this quit. Completely sober for almost a year! I could tell you a million positives that have come out of this endeavor, but that's not what this post is about. This post is my confession. 

> **“As You Think, So Shall You Be.”** \-  Dr. Wayne Dyer 

I've realized throughout my 65 years that when we verbalize a thought, it becomes more real. And when I ruminate on something, it generally happens. And when we put that thought in front of an audience, we garner accountability.   


I hold myself and my continued sobriety accountable to the Universe, myself, my husband, my business, and to you, dear Reddit Community. Thank you for being here every single day!

The front door to my apartment is broken. Heck most of my apartment is broken. My eyes hurt from crying. There is red wine all over the walls. I think I had a panic attack or something.

This is my first time ever posting on Reddit… and I’m asking for a little help/advice/encouragement. 

I am 25 and think I drink too much. I don’t want to never drink again, but I can have a bottle of wine a night no problem and it’s starting to impact my sleep, anxiety, and relationship. 
I feel like I just got in such a habit of drinking wine at the end of the day, and now it’s become normal, and now a bottle is my new normal and I want to nip this in the bud. 

I’ve tried to stop drinking before and go a few days but inevitably end up giving in. 

SO. I would love any advice you may have. There are so many cons to drinking with so so so few (any?) pros. How can I stop? How do I break a habit now so integrated into my routine and “culture”? (By that I mean I’m in my 20’s, all my friends and family drink too much, it’s just expected I will as well)

Feeling so fortunate to be a completely different person, leading a completely different life.","1,002 days ago I was unhappily married, bloated, unhealthy, miserable and trapped drinking a bottle of wine a night (or more). When I say drinking, I mean waiting until 5pm and skulling it as quickly as I could, not remembering cooking dinner or speaking with the kids, and passing out by 8:30pm.

I tried to moderate. That never worked. I tried switching to vodka. Same outcome. I was utterly and hopelessly stuck in a cycle of wake up hungover and regretful, struggle to work vowing not to drink that much tonight, perk up by the afternoon, bottle shop on the way home, black out. Rinse and repeat. 

So what changed?

I had let alcohol lesson my senses enough so that I accepted living with an abusive alcohol dependant husband. Until I didn’t. One night I finally said enough. Split from my husband and stopped drinking that day. I mourned for the young woman I used to be. Head strong, independent, kind and loving, and in control. Where was she? Still there, but dulled and poisoned into submission. 

My mantra in the early days was “nothing changes if nothing changes”. And I needed everything to change. 

But I knew I couldn’t have real change until I un-indoctrinated myself from the lie that is drinking. I did this by reading the cold, hard facts in books, on websites and of course here in SD. Alcohol Explained is one book that stood out for me. The first five chapters are free (google Alcohol Explained free PDF). 

I worked every day on my sobriety for at least the first year, then alcohol slowly started to fade into the back of my mind. I learnt more about myself in that first year than I had in the last ten. And finally at about 15 months I felt free. 

Thats not to say I don’t still need to recommit to my sobriety regularly. I do. 

So what’s changed? Too many things to list. And all for the better. I have a beautiful relationship with my kids now - I am mentally present and fully engaged with them. I have a lovely boyfriend who is there for me and who loves me for me. I am so much healthier in my mind and body. And I feel so much more at peace. 

Life still throws curve balls at me, but I have so much more control of how I respond.

I had (have) 260+ days behind me, yet for some reason I built the last two weeks' holiday into a milestone after which I'd be cured or something. Whilst I did have a few days where two beers actually meant that (not twenty) there were plenty (including yesterday) where I was back to my old tricks again - hiding drinks, slipping out to the garage etc. I hate that guy.

My longest stint of sobriety in 15 or so years gave me so much, and I glad to have the insight to at least recognise what I'm doing now and intervene before things get back to where they were at the start of the year.

Over 150 days in, on my first attempt to stop drinking, and I had three drinks at a company party tonight. It sucks. My streak is over. BUT, I’m taking away some positives:
1. This is my third company party since I stopped, and my coworkers and I devour an open bar. I made it through two without drinking, and as the immortal Meatloaf says, “two outta three ain’t bad.”
2. I’m in my late 30s. Rarely have I ever even gone a week without drinking since I was 21. I’ve never even thought about quitting drinking until this year, and I made it five months without a drink, and even when I fucked up (tonight), I didn’t go nuts. I had three. Yes, that’s three too many, but it’s not two bottles of wine or a 750 ml bottle of vodka, which is what I was drinking every night when I stopped. 
3. I know I fucked up. In the past, this would have been a disappointing night. Only three drinks with an open bar? I’m wasting an opportunity! Well, not tonight. Tonight I know I wasted a good thing—but I still didn’t get wasted. 
4. Tomorrow is when my next longest streak starts.

2021-11-21 00:56:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qyogi2/longterm_success_going_it_alone/,Long-term Success Going It Alone?,"Lurked on this sub on and off for almost two years. I finally made the definitive decision that moderation isn't for me, and that sobriety is a necessity to be who I aspire to be. Moderation worked for me, until it didn't. Then it worked again, until it didn't. Then it worked again, and again, and again, until I realized it really wasn't working.

Initially, I feared the finality of my decision. The first few nights I agonized over it. I mourned for some sort of loss I felt. But with each passing day, what became a conscious decision to cease drinking became unconscious. As the number of consecutive sober days grew, and life's many distractions shifted my attention, I unconsciously replaced my initial spurt of discipline with something more subtle: A calm but firm sense of resolve that my course of action was the correct one. I am currently 46 days in, and I recognize the foundation of my present success lies in that resolve. 

This sense of resolve began as a visceral response. After tracking my drinking habits for a month, the numbers truly scared me. I recognized that as a mid-twenties, single man, I was capable of being a highly functional alcoholic, but I was robbing myself and others of a better version of myself. The people I intend to meet over my life trajectory, hopefully one that includes a wife and children, deserve that better version of me.

I broke my old habits, despite doubting I could. I recognize that I must maintain a level of vigilance in maintaining my new habits, but I am uncertain as to the highly personalized path to proceed. Each individual's journey is unique, but parallels certainly exist, as evidenced in this sub and the many groups out there. I started this on my own, and currently wish to stay that course for the most part, but am looking for feedback or perspective.

I have yet to tell anyone I am sober. I am a private person, and intend to tell only a few of my loved ones when I feel it is appropriate. Now doesn't feel right. I have not sought out external treatment or programs, as I believe I do my best work alone. My mental health is not an issue presently, but this aspect of self-care is one I am monitoring. I genuinely feel I am currently in the best mental health state of my life.

But I feel that to compound on my current success, I need to be proactive in setting up some kind of personal support system to maintain my path. Lurking on this sub was an excellent start, and this post marks the start of my active participation. I am comfortable with that step for now, as this post represents a palatable level of accountability.

I don't believe it's validation that I seek, but perhaps I am simply lacking the self-awareness to recognize if I am. I want to know if anyone has advice or comments on solely utilizing this sub as their basis of social support, and otherwise going it alone. 

Thank you in advance for your perspective. IWNDT.",5

The tale of my Honeymoon slip up.","Hey y'all, so about 46 days ago I sobered back up on my original two year anniversary. Long and short of it. I was on my honeymoon and thought I could control it. 
   So for about a few months prior I started thinking that I had some real time under my belt, I had never had a good chunk of sobriety since I turned 21. I really thought that this time was different. I thought that I could moderate responsibly, I had been kicking the idea of drinking around in my head on a lower level of my brain. Almost on a primal level. 
    Me and my lovely wife had been waiting on our honeymoon for almost 6 months. A first time on a plane, leaving the country. First real vacation since I had sobered up. An all inclusive resort on a tropical beach on the Mexican coast. All of the food and soda a guy can enjoy. The sun, the sand and the iguanas. It was a Paradise.
        I don't know what finally flipped the switch. I ordered a shot of my favorite whiskey and sipped on it. Then immediately ordered a beer and a few more. Went to bed and had a decent morning the next day. Around lunch time I started drinking again. And kept on drinking til that evening. My better half, my loving wife had a frank conversation with me about how she likes me more when I'm sober. Hell, I like me better sober.
    I stopped then and there. Woke up feeling like crud the next day and came clean on here and stop drinking. That was 46 days ago. In the last two years and almost two months I had roughly 26 hours of drinking. In the past 46 days I realized that it was this monster that sits on my shoulder whispering let's have a drink, you can have one. I gave in, I drank.
  I know that I cannot drink anymore, I just dropped back to where I was at when I stopped after that first beer. The thing that really gets me and I know it's only a little thing is the ""high score"" I was racking up. I'm grateful for the slip, it showed me that I've made some serious progress on all fronts. It showed me I could get my ass in gear and that I'm the one driving the ship. I know I have it in me to beat my high score. And luckily it's on the same anniversary date as my original just two years forward. 10/06/19- 10/05/21. 10/06/21-+.

I have been an alcoholic drinking every day for roughly 13 years and have tried to get sober many times over the past 3 or so years but it never lasted very long. 
When we first got together and through the past couple years we have been drinking buddies although I always drank much more per day than him and mostly just tried to keep from withdrawals each day. He has always compared this to how much he would drink even though he turns into a drunken idiot and blacks out at much lower levels than it took me to just maintain myself, saying at least he’s not as bad if an alcoholic as I am. 
Well, we started living together off and on the past year or so both having seasonal jobs in different places. After my previous position I decided to try and have a more stable relationship and follow him to the next town. 
We signed a year lease with a college girl we only met online, and then I got my DUI about 3 months ago. I have been ordered to go to outpatient treatment where I am getting tested randomly each week and have really tried to get and stay sober starting with a detox center before I began, and also attending treatment groups 12 hours a week. 
From my time that I detoxed I have asked him to please stop drinking because I can’t be around him when he is like that and he has also significantly messed up his life with alcohol as well. He said he knows he needs to stop and is trying, but every time I come home he is drunk. He always looks at me with glasses over eyes and denies it repeatedly. This makes me super angry and frustrated which then makes me really want a drink. I constantly find all the cans he tries to hide as well which is very triggering. These actions make me really doubt that he cares about anything I’m going through or our relationship. I don’t know how to explain to him how this makes me feel that will actually make him care about me and that if I drink I will go to jail I can’t be around him if he doesn’t care about my sobriety.",17

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*


**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**


I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.


Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.


It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!


---


**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!


What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.


**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.


**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Liquid courage. That's one of the many names for alcohol, because it lowers your inhibitions in the moment. However, as I reflect on the many years I spent drinking, I realize that the overarching theme of my life was actually one of being too anxious and afraid to do so many things. If I'm being honest, I was afraid of vulnerability and of being rejected, no matter how much ""liquid courage"" I was pouring down my own throat. And so I took very few risks or opportunities that might have pushed me out of my comfort zone. For all that liquid courage, I did very little that could be considered brave. 


One of the patterns that I am noticing in my sober life is actual courage; finding the courage to step outside of my comfort zone and to volunteer for things where I otherwise wouldn't have. For example, it took me months to work up the courage to volunteer to host the DCI. What if I do a bad job? What if I can't think of anything to say? What if I fail? And yet, my fellow Sobernauts, here I am. It turns out that sober me is braver than drunk me, even sans liquid courage. Sober me is able to take a step back and put things into better perspective - to understand that even failure is rarely the end of the world or the end of the story. But there *is* no story if you can't even bring yourself to try. 


They call it liquid courage, but you couldn't prove it by me.


I'm so happy to have the opportunity to host the DCI this week and share this time with my community. Please tell me about the things that sobriety has given you the courage to do, or the things you are still working up the courage to do in your sober lives. ",316

Almost two months ago I made the decision to finally reach out to my family to ask for help in getting out of the completely unmanageable disaster I created for myself. The alcohol had always been present, but I tried most drugs people could think of and a lot of research chemicals as well. Toward the end, I had blown over $7000 on cocaine and alcohol.

I basically lost everything. I was terrified of rehab… but it was one of the most eye-opening, incredible experiences of my life. I now have relocated and currently am in a halfway house. 

Never did I think I would ever have an opportunity like this, with 30 days of sobriety. From 16-25 I never made it more than a day or two without taking something, excluding one 6-day vacation with family. Surreal feeling

Also, throwaway account here.

&#x200B;

Anyway, so something thats been on my mind are my drinking habits. My daily routine is essentially getting off work and having \~4 beers a day. I get home and have one to unwind before I cook dinner. The i have another while cooking dinner and have another probably 2 afterwards so its roughly 4 beers a day. some thing ive noticed is that when ive had a little more- say, 6 or 7 I dont have a hangover which is somewhat new and it caught me by surprise one day when I woke up.

&#x200B;

So here's the thing. background is now out of the way. Ive read posts of people saying what they would drink before quitting and I think i'm not that bad. I'm fine right? Right? But I've also noticed I just dont enjoy beers as much as I have before. Now it sort of just feels like something I do in a way. I used to genuinely love trying new beers, going to breweries, you know?  Not as much.

&#x200B;

So a little more context. My job is that I do wildland firefighting and if theres anyone here who does the job or is familiar with it, you know that at times youre just kind of out in camp for 2 weeks(or 3 if you happened to extend). Youre not allowed to drink when youre out like this. Period. Its not an option. I do this fine. But I wonder if the reason is that its not an option so who cares or because I'm really actually just fine but I dont know. These stretches of time are the only times I have forgone drinking this year besides one other day. But I'm fine when i'm on these assignments.

&#x200B;

I've considered laying off and quitting drinking but in my head I'm not sure if it's necessary but theres another component here and it's fear. I'm not sure what to do with my free time because beer related stuff is often my free time. Going to breweries is often the main social interaction I get outside of work. Work doesn't count me to me. My coworkers are people I eat with, sleep with, work with, take craps with, etc. As shallow as it is because I know they're just there to serve me beer; it is what it is. A possible random small interaction with someone at a brewery,

&#x200B;

Im really just not sure and I'm torn and indecisive. I considered stopping when the holidays are over so I can have less pressure on going for it. Not putting it off as it's something that i have been thinking about for a period of time now. However part of me says it is not necessary.

&#x200B;

I am asking you all for input(even though I know what this sub is about. I understand there is biasness but kind of why I am here) as I doubt I am the only one who has been in this- if not, a similar situation and want your thoughts. Thanks for reading this far.

I was just out an hour ago and had my Shirley temple (which I recommend because they’re far more delicious than any alcoholic beverage ever was) and when a bartender asked if I wanted a refill he made it with vodka without asking.

2021-11-20 21:31:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qykziq/not_a_real_alcoholic/,"Not a ""real"" alcoholic","Maybe some of you can relate.

I had the issue of not seeing myself as a ""real"" alcoholic because I only drank on weekends and holidays... or whenever I had a day off for whatever reason. And on occasion, I could have one beer or glass of wine with dinner and then stop for the night, usually when having dinner with my parents or in-laws. And I never really liked hard alcohol. So in my mind, as someone who compulsively drank 3-4 liters of beer or two bottles of wine while chainsmoking every weekend and often blacked out and ruined numerous friendships over the years because of stupid shit I did or said while drunk, I had a problem, but not *that* much of a problem. 

After all, ""real"" alcoholics need hard alcohol just to get through the day and drink all throughout the day every day and I don't do any of that, so I can't be a ""real"" alcoholic. That's what I told myself for over a decade.

The funny thing is my wife is more in denial than I was. ""Just drink less! There are times where you're able to moderate, why don't you just always do that??"" 

She has that magical ability to have a few drinks then know when to stop and then actually stop. I tried telling her it just doesn't work like that for me, but then she'd always point out those 1 in 100 times where I managed to moderate and refused to listen. I didn't even tell her I've given up drinking because I don't want to hear I should ""just drink in moderation"" again. She actually bought me a bottle of my favorite wine a week or two after I decided to stop but I dumped it out in the sink while she was out one day (which felt amazing) so she probably assumes I just drank it.

But I digress. So what made me stop after all these years of not being a ""real"" alcoholic and countless hangovers where I told myself that that was the last time? Well, again unlike a ""real"" alcoholic I didn't hit ""rock bottom"" and there wasn't some super embarrassing event (I'd had plenty of those throughout the years already and still kept chugging along). It was just the fact that my daughter is two now and doesn't know what drinking is, much less what having a drinking problem is, and I didn't want her to learn what it is from me. I've read enough stories on Reddit about alcoholics and their kids from both perspectives and the older she gets the more it bothered me.

The underwhelming ""event"" that made me stop was one Saturday my wife was going to a conference and so it was just gonna be me and my daughter the whole day, but then Friday night I drank compulsively again and was hungover on Saturday, so instead of taking her to the park, we just sat around and watched cartoons all day. And that just made me feel like a total fucking loser. And so I decided to stop. For real this time.

This is now my seventh weekend in a row without having a single drop of alcohol, something I don't think 
I've managed in over 10 years. I also haven't had a cigarette either, as I only ever got cravings to smoke when I drank. I'm still fat, haven't lost a single pound yet, and honestly I don't feel any better physically (besides not being hungover on the weekend), but I am super proud I stopped. Almost see this as a bigger achievement than earning my degrees.",33

I didn't take the drink, I went home instead. So I guess that's a victory, but is it really? 

Really hoping I'm on the precipice of something good here, because right now the only upside I'm seeing is a bit more money in the bank, and if I'm being 100% honest, I wouldn't feel to bad about spending a bit that money on something that would put me in that nice drunken state where I can forget about the pain for a little while.

Started my sober journey nearly two years ago. Last year was filled with countless Day 1s, three day streaks, and so on.

The day after Thanksgiving of last year was when I just... stopped. No fanfare, no discussion, no AA; I decided I wanted to break that three day streak, so I made it through day four, then day five, then a week, then I just kept going. 

It's been a long year. It's been an amazing year. I got a new job last November, too; my face now looks so different from the security ID photo. Lost roughly 40 pounds. Ran a 5k this morning with one of the kids.

And, of course, the house. It was well within our price range (mortgage plus utilities is about half of what we're paying in rent in our current place), so we went for it, and now I have my very own house key.

There are days that aren't easy, not gonna lie. I still cry in my car on occasion, still get anxious about things (waiting to close on the house was BRUTAL). Having a routine helps, a lot; I take a lot of comfort in that. Having small, manageable goals helps, too. I wanted to lose the alcohol weight, so I got back into the habit of using My Fitness Pal and a food scale; then I started walking, increasing my time and my distance until I decided to start running. I'm going for a half marathon next year. That's a hell of a far cry from a year ago when I was laying on the couch with liver pain and gout, wondering if tomorrow would finally be the day my eyes began to jaundice.

But honestly 2021 was probably my most alcoholic year. Drank heavily almost every day after January. Started having some physical side effects. I did start seeing a therapist in September though. Initially there was some serious help, then the weekly session, I just kind of drifting back into it and it really wasn’t helping. 

Then in mid November I got really sick (not covid) and tried to drink myself out of it. Dam I felt horrible. Couldn’t breathe couldn’t get energy to do anything. Fuck it was bad.

Anyways long story short I’m giving this shit up, hopefully forever. I want to live and see my kids grow tall, people on Mars, hit my work goals, hit my fitness goals, all sort of shit. There is so much I want to do and beer is keeping me from achieving it today and tomorrow. 

I’ve been sober for 4 days now. It’s been brutal, heavy alcohol withdrawal symptoms. But I’m going to keep with it. My goal is to the end of the year and I’ll deal with beyond that after I hit that goal. 

Biggest help this time is and why I feel like I can do it, is I’ve actually told people I am quitting drinking for health reasons until the end of the year. Everyone has been very supportive. I should’ve told them all earlier.

I made a commitment this week to quit but hadn't mentioned it to him. 

Since last week, he'd been planning a dinner party. He'd asked me to bring wine and dessert.  Our friends at the party were the same friends we were out with us last weekend when I made an ass of myself. 

I had full confidence that I wouldn't have any trouble not drinking. I was just so focused this week on reading This Naked Mind, Kick the Drink... Easily, and this sub, that I'm just not worried about being tempted. I've made up my mind. 

Everyone was drinking red wine throughout the night. I think they probably had almost two bottles each. 

The beginning of the night was the only time I had any compulsion to drink. At the beginning of any party, there's generally some kind of ""warm-up"" period, regardless of if people are drinking or not. When you've worked a full 8 hour day, there's a bit of transition to flipping into the social mood. 

I was vaping a little bit of THC, so I wasn't fully sober ... but compared to how I feel drinking - I was crystal clear :) 

At the beginning of the night as everyone started getting drunk I noticed that with the help of a little bit of alcohol everyone else was a bit more high energy than me. And I was a little bit self-conscious of that. But as the night progressed I just realized that everyone who was drinking (everyone but me) just *needed* more and more alcohol. 

It's just interesting being a bystander. The addictive properties of alcohol were really obvious. 

By the end of the night, I was still pretty sharp and chatty. Pretty much everyone else at a minimum just had this general haze. Lack of clarity, lack of focus. Alcohol just kind of numbed everyone. It's just weird to observe. 

It feels awesome to have put myself in what I would normally consider one of the most difficult situations, and made it through easily. 

I'm so grateful for this community. IWNDWYT!",17

Last night, I found myself crying in line for soft serve. My partner and I were waiting outside for about 20 minutes in near freezing weather. There were a few outdoor tables lined up next to us, as has become so popular in covid-times. 

My partner noticed the quirky drink glasses the restaurant was using-- that super cute style where it looks like the glass is tipping over when it's actually flat on the table. 

They said to me, ""we should go to this restaurant some time and get you a shirly temple or a ginger ale and ask for it to be in one of those glasses!"".

For some reason, I felt tears prickling up in my eyes. I realized I am grieving no longer being able to enjoy an activity that I really, really liked. How stupid. I felt like I will now forever be a child asking for their milk in The Adult Cup.

I actively try to avoid looking at people drinking, because it makes me jealous that they're ""allowed"" to (hah, funny how the brain works). 

I keep trying to focus on how choosing to not drink is actually one of the most grown-up things I could have chosen for myself. I am happier sober, I am a better partner sober, and I enjoy my life more sober.

I figured the geographic change would prove to be beneficial. And it was. I moved to a sober house in atlanta. There is something about not wanting to be homeless in an unfamiliar city that kept me sober, going to meetings, manipulating the system, relapsing on a drug not routinely tested for, lying, getting back into the same fucking junkie ass behavior without booze or oxycontin....

I lied about my sobriety date. I was collecting a chip at a meeting for 6 months clean while I was high.  Nothing too crazy. 

I mean, fuck. I've learned to navigate my life as a snake, an opportunistic scavenger, con artist.. 

I had the eventual ""come to jesus"" moment, and spilled the beans. I was living in a recovery home at the time and one unflinching stipulation was a zero tolerance policy regarding use: use, you're out. Well, because I was honest about it, they let me stay.

And then they got kratom tests.

And then I found phenibut...

Ahhh fuck I'm rambling now. Long story short, I moved back home after getting kicked out for repeatedly relapsing..

Since March when I moved back, I've drank nearly every night and managed to get myself physically dependent on drugs.

The bad part is that now I have things to lose...
For the first time in my life, I've got a job that makes me enough money to be comfortably independent, doing something I absolutely love. I've got my own place. I've got a kitten. I take care of my houseplants...

...and I feel like I'm about to lose it all. Again. Again. Fuck. Sorry.

I'm not sure if this type of post is allowed but I don't know where else to turn. And I think other alcoholics/addicts are the only ones who can truly empathize with what I'm going through.

I am 6 months sober. I went to a 45 day treatment and came out a better, healthier, happier me. I am working a recovery program by going to 2 groups a week and keeping in contact with family (I used to avoid/isolate from them).

The issue is... my boyfriend is a weed smoker. If it was up to him without my input, he would smoke all day and night. For the first few months after rehab, we agreed he would only smoke at night and never in the house. That went up in flames when I walked in on him smoking in our bed and he admitted he had been the whole time because he ""didn't think it was a big deal.""

Since then we have been all over the place. He stopped for awhile, he started again (and went crazy smoking all the time), now we are at a weird impasse where he smokes sometimes. But I've realized through all of this that I have just not been happy. The only time I thought things were going well was when he quit for awhile, but apparently that was the worst time for him.

To add to the issue, we have a 1 year old daughter, and I am pregnant with our son.

What should I do? What would you all do? Could you handle being with a weed smoker and if so, how do I do it? I should also mention weed is a HUGE trigger for me right now. Whenever I smoked in the past I would drink before or after or both. And because weed was not my addiction, I worry if I find it laying around my addict brain will convince me ""it's just weed! Not alcohol!"" And it would spiral from there.

I may have a different view on this in the future, I dunno, but right now it's tearing me apart.",1

Got me some N.A. beers and liquid death. Stayed hydrated and had an amazing time. Not saying its easy, but it is getting easier. Sometimes I can't believe that I am actually doing this. Definitely feeling a shift in my personality and self confidence. 

&#x200B;

The company I work for just built us a new office, and I have to go back to work in person after 2 years of working from home. Before the pandemic we definitely had a drinking culture. There were beers in the fridge at all times and you were free to grab one at the end of the day. Which now I see is part of the reason I started drinking to access towards the end of my run. Not gonna lie I can kind of scared about this. I have my tools now though, play the tape forward, it's not worth it. Going to just keep taking this one step at a time, one day at a time. Luckily I have another sober coworker on my team and we can keep an eye on each other. He is only a month behind me.  Our company Christmas party happens to land on my 1 year date.

Triggered af at how I was talked to but on a certain level I understand she learned to talk to me that way because of my drinking. Damnit.,"Even though we’re anonymous here I can’t go I can’t go into the details but my partner is making some very bad decisions (not alcohol related) that put us both at serious risk.

I’m not a lawyer but I’ve worked with them a lot, against them a lot, and have several in my life. Always been very interested in the field, even considered a run at it in my youth. You could call me a well-informed amateur with years of working experience in the exact area she’s making bad decisions.

Discussing it today with one of her coworkers (who is also put at risk by these decisions), she didn’t like what I was saying and in the most condescending tone possible said, “thank you, you’re dismissed.”

White hot fucking rage. She grew up middle class, I grew up poor. So much complicated emotional/historical triggers there, and understanding our different responses to different stimuli has been a long-running discussion for us. Put frankly, while we fell in love when I was a chef there was a major class imbalance as she was a world-traveling businesswoman. The classism was definitely there, but between fights she was really great about apologizing and trying to understand.

Already texted me to apologize in this case.

Getting a “professional” job and making big money like her helped.

Sliding into full blown alcoholism didn’t help. 

And then I quit my job at least in part to get sober, and gravitated to the trades again—good market niches to occuy, and better suited to where I want to be in life.

Classism has crept back and while I’ve really struggled with sobriety I went from a 1/2 bottle + daily to probably no more than one a month tops. Not too shabby for a few months after two decades of drinking. Plenty of work to do but keeping that progress in mind gives me strength.

Leaving aside the classism, there were so many nights where she just had to throw up her hands and leave, or dismiss me from the room. It’s learned behavior and I helped her learn it. And I guess (fairly, I think) she’s got a lot of healing and learning to do too, and it’s unfair of me to expect it to happen all at once or even really in months or years.

Edit: took a nap on it and removed an unnecessary paragraph of rant.

I didn't black out I didn't do anything stupid. I am disappointed but still proud I was good for 10 days. Baby steps and appreciating the process helps me. I started drinking at 12 y/o on weekends with friends. It started with beers then quickly went to bottles.by 16 I was having a shower beer before I went to school. I never struggles with school. I was a teacher's pet. I love learning and exploring. Buy I had a very rough upbringing. I have lived alone for the last two years of my life. I moved out due to my mother's drug issues (she's clean now) these issues. Make me feel isolated because I couldn't tell others about my issue. I never drank everyday of the week until COVID. I had 3-4 months benders with maybe a week break in between.

What I'm truely trying to get at is sometimes I will slip. Sometimes the craving will overcome me. This one night will not define my sobriety. I am still struggling. My past family issues are one excuse I use to drink another is my job. I work IT, if you know anything about the IT industry your never thanked for you work. You almost always get asked what do you why do we need you. It takes a mental toll not feeling appreciated. All of these are excuses I use. I have learned these excuses bring me back to my upbringing. My father was a verbally abusive alcoholic and his father too. I have cut both of them out of my life. I have swore to become a better man than my father. I believe the first step to becoming a better man is sort out my drinking habits.

I’m having difficulty focusing on everyday life because I’m constantly seeking to rid myself of these cravings and anxiety, be it with redddit or exercise or reading or guitar etc, none of which actually eliminates my cravings/anxiety just seems to push it aside for a moment.

For the last 6 weeks I have been trying to make healthier choices and have moderated my drinking almost in half. But I’m realizing it’s not enough. I am ready to go all in. 6 weeks ago when I decided to make a change, I signed up for a 5k race, which is something I’ve always wanted to do. Well I’ve been training regularly with the help of an app, and I was so excited to do my first 5k. Well it didn’t happen. Because of alcohol. My SO is a very heavy drinker, and last week while he was very drunk he broke the driver side window of my car. So since my car is in the shop being replaced, I assumed he would take me to my race (50 miles away, I live in rural texas). Last night he informed me that he would not be taking me, would not be getting up early on a Saturday and “it is what it is”. 😒 I realized pretty quick that the reason he would not be taking me is because he bought an 18 pack and was more interested in drinking every one than taking me to do something I’ve worked toward for 6 weeks. So last night I was upset, drank 4 beers, realized it didn’t and wouldn’t help my mood so I quit and went to bed. Woke up today sad knowing I missed my race, which actually meant a lot to me no matter how silly it sounds to anyone else.  So what is the lesson here? Alcohol sucks. There is not one positive thing that will come from drinking, even in moderation ( and moderation never actually lasts for me). I have a lot of decisions to make in the near future about my relationship and my life in general, but I know one decision I’m making today. Sober. 100%. For good. I’ve been reading the stories on here for days and that’s what made me realize that I can’t fool myself into thinking drinking is a good idea any more! So thank y’all.",16

I just wanted to quick share my story of where I was one year ago and where I am today. For most of 2020 I was using alcohol sometimes all day, but for sure every day! and it was wearing out every dopamine receptor in my head.

On the night of 11/19 2020.  I went for a late night walk drunk and on stimulants.   In my cloudy mind I thought it would be a good idea to bring my .38 revolver because “there are wolves and bucks in the woods and I might need protection”

My cloudy mind also thought, “hey we gotta go to bed at a decent time so we better take a Xanax.” This all happened around midnight, I woke up around four in the morning fully closed on my couch gripping a loaded gun in my right hand finger outside of the trigger guard.

 I slowly got up and panicked. I was in complete shock as I saw the wreckage of my living room l, empty bottle of Jack Daniels, empty baggy….the mess! And the head pouring!
 I set my gun down with shaking hands and went to the bathroom. I found myself and then all familiar place in front of the bathroom mirror looking back at those bloodshot eyes, thinking when is this nightmare going to end. I also saw the red rings on my trigger finger as I had been clenching the outside of the trigger guard.  (Inside and it would have emptied a bullet)

 How many times have I been here before and maybe sobered up for a week and then gone right back into my normal drinking schedule.

Well then I changed a lot of things, I had what some people I. Sobriety call “A spiritual awakening”.  It was very odd for me as an Atheist/Agnostic but something in my being changed as I broke down and asked a “god” who may or may not exist to transform and change me.

 I realized I could stop now before tragedy hit or I can continue on and let the event of a tragedy be my rock bottom. I’ve had to reset my sobriety date a handful of times on the sub Reddit and probably 100 times in my own life.

I just want to thank the people who helped me out along the way it’s all of you you’re on the sub Reddit to check in every day it’s the people I have in my life. I didn’t feel like I had a lot of friends and family who could help even though I really did this time I made friends I started going to AA meetings and I’ve made some lifelong friends now I have a house, I have a wonderful girlfriend, And I have a new job where I am well respected and show respect for all my coworkers. And here they have something called the promises and all I can say is they have become true for me and I hope that will become true for anyone else who goes on this journey.",188

Has anyone else dealt with people making weird ass comments about you not drinking? People who simply cannot fathom why/how you’re not jumping on the opportunity to have a drink or 5 with them?

I was at a function a few weeks ago and alcohol was being served and nearly everyone was drinking it. When someone saw me with a water, they asked me why I wasn’t drinking. Someone else said “heh heh heh, she doesn’t drink anymore!” in this odd sarcastic tone. Like, it was a baby shower. In the middle of the day. There were several other people there not drinking and also, who cares?

My FIL retired recently and we had a lovely dinner with him. Everything was awesome until he “jokingly” asked me if I was pregnant because I wasn’t drinking champagne with them. Dude, seriously? 

I have been sober since February 15. Choosing to not drink has been one of the best things I have ever done for myself. I am 100% certain I am doing the right thing for me and am confident in my choice. Also, I absolutely NEVER criticize others or look down on anyone for drinking. I don’t even think about it tbh. 

I’m not gonna let it get to me or upset me but I’m just shocked that seeing someone not drinking makes people act like dicks.  Just curious if anyone else has experienced this, and how do you respond (if you do)? Thanks for listening. Iwndwyt!",20

2021-11-20 06:51:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qy42fl/holiday_sobervival_guide_megathread/,Holiday Sobervival Guide Megathread!,"Happy Holidays Sobernauts! We know that this season is fraught for most of us, especially the newly sober. Whether you felt more comfortable drinking at the holidays because you're a party animal and the holidays have always been your time to shine or because you have painful memories or even traumas from holiday seasons past, the next 6 weeks of the calendar might be looking like a minefield full of booze traps to be crossed right about now. 

If you’ve managed to string together a few weeks or months finally but are thinking about taking some time off the wagon as a holiday “treat” for yourself, I hope you will consider my story. Of course, your own results could vary, but for me it was a terrible, terrible idea. Because of that sort of “eh, I’m doing better now and it’s the holidays for fucks’ sake, it’s the boozing season and I simply *must* drink away my holiday trauma memories bla bla bla . . .” logic, I got to experience the excruciating hell that is kindling. The withdrawals I experienced around January 21-25 2018 were an experience I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. The first few stabs I had taken at quitting prior to the holidays had given me such mild and practically nonexistent withdrawal symptoms that I thought either 1. I wasn’t as addicted as I had feared (ha) or 2. others were exaggerating their symptoms (um no). So after my little “I’ll just drink until the new year” bender, which of course ended up going 3 weeks past the new year, I had pretty much all the withdrawal symptoms except DTs and a seizure (at least I don’t think I had a seizure but things were pretty dicey in my brain for a few days there). And the lesser symptoms went on for about 6 or 8 weeks. So that’s my cautionary tale. I almost didn’t break up the hoped-for pithiness of this post with this downer of a story, but I couldn’t resist on the notion that if even one person reading decides to stay sober instead of trying to moderate for the holidays then quit again, well, it’s worth it to me.

So all this said, the mod team wanted to give you this thread so you all can **share tips and ideas, ask questions, and commiserate**. Please feel free to vent about your family, share your painful holiday memories if that lightens your burden, ask questions of more experienced sobernauts about specific events you have coming up, or share what has worked for you. 

To get the ball rolling, here are some thoughts from a few of us on the mod squad:

u/stratyturd always brings his own stash of sparkling water and snacks. If he’s feeling fancy, he brings a 12 pack of Topo Chico. If necessary he brings his own cooler to store them so that people don't snatch them up for mixing in their own drinks. He always keeps his own na drink in hand and food nearby.

u/xen440tway  says being the default designated driver is a good go-to. 

u/soafithurts brings NA drinks in cans, which were her preferred vessels to begin with, and always brings her own cool holiday koozies. This means she just blends in since most people’s drinks are also in a koozie. She notes also how rare it is for anyone to actually care that she’s not drinking. She loves to say “no thanks, I don’t actually drink” if anyone does offer her alcohol these days, however. N/A lifestyle fully embraced!

u/bloodguardbanner always volunteers to cook something for parties so he is busy beforehand with something to focus on other than “not getting to drink”. Focus on what you *are* able to do and what you are doing well. 

u/firstsoberrodeo’s strategy is to surround herself with the people who are dearest to her and give herself a break from difficult, triggering people. She notes that this year the pandemic can still be used as an excuse to avoid crowds. We still have a built-in excuse for avoiding those sorts of events this year, friends! Use it if you need it!

u/gregnegative has embraced relaxing into the cheesy Hallmark movies during the holiday season. Those movies, set in the beautifully decorated Pacific Northwest of the US, show you where actors’ careers have gone in the afterlife and they feature plots that are delightfully predictable and have absolutely no real conflict. Escapist bliss! For events, he swears by the French exit-- quietly dipping out without even saying any goodbyes-- when an event becomes unpleasant or uncomfortable for any reason. In early sobriety he also had excuses for not drinking pre-loaded as to why I couldn't drink.: ""on medication"", ""have to work early"", ""designated driver"", etc.

u/sfgirlmary s also a fan of the ol’ French exit. Related, she always has her own transportation plan so she isn’t waiting around on someone else before she can leave. A terrific trick she uses for parties and events is to make herself the event photographer. She says “I take an actual digital camera, not just a phone, and I go around taking fun photos for social media posts later. This solves several problems at once: it keeps me occupied so I don’t think too much about drinking, the host/hostess loves it, and somehow people don’t question why I’m not drinking when I have a camera in my hands and am busy doing a job”. She also plans to put in some effort at her mother’s assisted living home to bring some cheer to the older people who don’t have the gifts of health and mobility that we have this year. This was part of a discussion we had about not only surviving but thriving during the holidays. This is important. 

This is the sort of claim in a long-term sober person’s post that I did not believe when I was a heavy drinking lurker to this sub but I swear it is true: being sober during the holidays has enabled me to heal from my old holiday grief. Of course it did not happen during my first sober holiday season and I still am not the biggest Christmas fanatic you’ll ever meet or anything like that. But I like the holidays again! I love the lights and I love the cookies. I like the goofy sweaters. I like putting dorky bowties on my dogs’ collars. I do not think of the holidays as a season of grief and pain anymore. The holidays are a season for me to enjoy too now in my way. And the others on the mod team feel the same way: the holidays have more potential for human connection, love, and even joy when sober. It may not happen your first sober year (though you still might be surprised that it simply doesn’t suck as much as you thought it would), and we cannot guarantee that it will ever happen. But we truly believe it is at least possible and worth the try. You, yes even YOU, can not only survive the holidays with your sobriety in tact, but can have a joyful season of eating, not drinking, and being merry.",391

My wife takes the kids to gym/ballet and I get to get out of the house for a couple of hours. I reciprocate Sunday mornings.

Typically, for me, my downtime has meant getting out and having a change of scenery. Maybe finding a spot in the park to do some reading, listen to a podcast or just generally mooch on Reddit. It’s a wind down after the week and is really appreciated.

With winter setting in now though, the park (and outdoors in general!) isn’t an option so I’ve started to look for coffee shops - and I’ve been amazed at how full they are. Like, if I can even get a a table, then I’ve got to queue for 10/15 minutes for a pretty average coffee. Even then, I get stuck on a small table with a load of noise and people constantly interrupting me to try to squeeze past me.

You know what isn’t like that, though? The pub. The nice, warm, quiet empty pub that is two minutes walk from where I live and has sports and some harmless Xmas music on. That’s where I can properly relax and chill at the end of the week. 

Yeah, I’m struggling and I guess I’m just angry about how I feel like I’m being pushed towards booze. I mean, I walked around for half an hour this morning trying to find somewhere/ANYWHERE that wasn’t the place selling alcohol two minutes from my house. And could I find anywhere? No. 

So I’m stuck at home now, when I’m just craving some “me-time” and a change of scenery. 

I’m not really sure what the point of this post is - maybe to ask if anyone has been in a similar situation. Maybe just to vent. 

I just feel sometimes that society/universe is just pushing me towards booze.",11

For fucks sake don't go off the opinion of just one internet stranger

In no particular order:

* Hate can set you free. I got more out of letting the hate I felt towards what alcohol did to me, the hate I felt towards other people, the world, etc be my north star than any attempt to be a good person. I didn't forgive. I didn't meditate. I didn't try to argue with or sooth my anger. I let it get as hot and wild as it wanted. It made it easier to look at alcohol as something mega stupid. It isn't some clever trickster devil anymore. Its as lowly and contemptable as rat shit and I relate to it accordingly. Hating people made it easier, ironically, to eventually let shit go. The wound wasn't mended so much as cauterized. 
* Life does not get immediately easy and happy upon reaching sustained sobriety. But you do stop poisoning yourself, ruining relationships in this particular way, and draining your bank account. Which is neat. 
* Get your endorphins other ways. Fuck if you can, self-fuck if you must. Exercise. Read. Take up art projects. Take controlled risks.
* You will probably get addicted to another substance or activity which is honestly whatevs compared to alcohol usually. For some its running, for others its weed, for others its volunteering, and for others still its crypto gambling. Follow your bliss.
* 12 step groups can be wonderful or awful. Ditto for their members. Many people struggle to find and stay with one they like. I bounced around and eventually stopped. Its the trying that matters more than anything.

Hope everyone finds their own path to freedom. Keep on keepin on. IWNDWYT",61

What do you do when something like this happens? The other people in the class must think I'm nuts and I am in a group whatsapp chat with the others but I'm not comfortable with putting a message on there as theres so many people in it including people who arent in this class.

After all, I proved I could handle being sober…what harm could one drink do?


My story isn’t unique at all — if I would have so much as stubbed my toe on the right day, I’d have made some “woe is I” excuse to drink. Within a short week, I worked my way up beyond a pint of vodka plus a few shooters (or more) every single day. This was significantly more than my prior consumption. My bowels were destroyed, my skin was inflamed, and my mind was tortured by perpetual fear. I withdrew from those who loved me as only the bottle could make the hurt stop for a few moments. I managed to live this hell for more than a year before I got help from friends and a psychiatrist. Just asking for help took all the strength i had. One drink my ass…I nearly drowned from one drink.

Excuse me if this is entirely banal, but I literally just came to a realisation about myself and my past behaviours that lead to me *starting on the path of being an alcoholic*.

Over the last little while I'd thought long and hard about my '**origin story**' - that is to say, how I had picked up the identity of a **""drinker""** *aka an alcoholic*.

When I was in my first flat with friends from my high school, of course there were parties. Huge ones even. People from a wider social circle that I had very little to do with were coming to party with our little flat. And somehow along the way I gained the reputation for being the guy who could really handle his drink. Well I thought this was the case anyway.

I'm talking going through a bottle of whiskey in a night and being 'fine'. I wasn't really fine though, I had just cultivated the ability of hiding pain so my friends had this impression of me that I was impervious to alcohol or something close to that. Well that's what I thought was going on.

I had recently figured out this much about myself, anyway. I'd been mulling it over for a while.

So cut to today, I've come across a lot of really positive videos on Youtube relating to self improvement and creating good habits. One of these creators I discovered just today, and I'm really enjoying his content. The channel is called Struthless  and he's an Australian artist who is now sober and loving life and a lot of the content on his channel really resonated with me, for obvious reasons.

Anyway, he sells merch. I checked the store out and in a few places he's modelling some of his shirts. My immediate reaction to the pose he chose in the photos was ***""cringe.""***. Even though I like and respect this person, I had a visceral reaction to him that I had to reflect on. I thought, why should it matter how he presents his work if it brings him happiness? And then I thought, I bet people cringe at me in the same way...

...And it hit me. I had been bullied in high school for being 'too much' and 'a dweeb'. I had tried my hardest to be cool and something I definitely wasn't in high school, and, as a result that feeling had carried over to the ""origin story"" - I had felt ashamed of who I was for reasons that were out of my control and I had invested heavily in trying to shed the skin of being that annoying nerd by being the ""*cool drinking guy*"".

The silly thing is, if I had the ability to go back in time and tell myself all this *I know* I wouldn't have listened. Younger me just had to learn the hard way, I just wish I had sooner.

So, what about you? Have you made any profound realizations about your own **""origin story""** recently?",5

2021-11-20 03:34:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qy1cvw/the_subconscious_brain_focuses_only_on_the_good/,"The subconscious brain focuses only on the good, never the bad about alcohol. It’s like propaganda news about alcohol.","Alcohol releases dopamine BUT the moment dopamine is flowing is only one part of it. It’s absolutely the lesser part of it. For the most part the experience is negative. Money, energy, time wasted. Poisoned hangovers, addiction, altered emotional brain feeling more boredom, anxiety, irritation, dysphoria, depression afterwards.

Alcohol cravings happen because that’s how dopamine works. The brain is wired to remind afterwards about the moments when dopamine was flowing. That’s how the subconscious brain directs behaviour. BUT it doesn’t understand that it’s tricked by a drug and focuses solely on WHEN dopamine was flowing, never on the complete picture of the drug use. The tricked subconscious brain then tricks the person, and it’s easy to get tricked by it.

It’s almost like getting propaganda news about alcohol delivered to your head by the subconscious brain. Don’t buy into it, it’s a false presentation. When dopamine stops flowing in alcohol the cravings, mental images, positive emotions related to alcohol will fade and give way to new things (wherever dopamine is now flowing)

I like to hit the gym, its endorphine and dopamine release is clearly very good, my wanting has shifted towards it. Making alcohol seem like a fart in the wind. Two thumbs up for physical exercise, it has helped me a ton 👍👍

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Smug Saturdays

The newly arrived u/contentious_Scot lit us up at yesterday’s Check-in with the excellent description of a busy Saturday that could begin bright and early, due to having NO HANGOVER.  A Smug Saturday! Does it ever get old??? Smug isn’t my favourite word in the world, I’d prefer a word that conveys more gratitude, but my love of alliteration overwhelms me this fine Saturday morning!

Making fresh coffee in a kitchen that was cleaned the night before.  No checking to see did your coat and bag make it home with you after Friday night’s after work drinks.  No ill-judged messages or phone calls to regret.

Getting in the car and never having to worry if you are over the limit.  Getting to the shops before the hoards descend, and getting the best of the bakery offerings.  If you’re a parent to sports playing teens, offering to do the early morning lift so that the other parents can rock up later, ashen faced. 

When I’m sitting with my first coffee, with only my dog for company, and a clear head, I feel proud of myself.  I hope you do too x",385

Throughout my heavy drinking I would still make lovely meals for my housemates but be unable to eat much of it, or else I’d eat it and then puke it all up next morning. Or I’d just eat shit food.

So, on preparing for my detox I bought a load of new pans and kitchen stuff to encourage me to make nice things again. Yesterday I cooked a lovely meal but I could feel that emptiness that comes from not having a drink. Having a glass on hand is just second nature.

Soft drinks just don’t really cut it so I have to confess to creating a Frankenstein’s cocktail of bitter lemon, lime, ginger and a healthy dollop of Carolina reaper hot sauce. Not gonna lie, it was pretty rank but it had a kick to it. It reminded me of being a kid and forcing myself to drink booze even though I didn’t like the taste yet. 

Anyway, day 5 done. Feeling good. IWNDWYT",20

I had this weird, panicked flashback as if I was suddenly three-years-ago-me. 

Several years ago, if someone had texted suddenly on a weekday when I was home, I would've for sure been at least pretty buzzed. My place would be a disaster because I just let it get that way until I couldn't stand it anymore. I would've stumbled around trying to throw things in closets and clean enough dishes to seem acceptable, and try to hide whatever I had been drinking (not before taking another shot, though!) I'd need to scramble to brush my teeth and put eye drops in and try to appear put together. I'd be a wreck the whole time wondering if they saw through me and wondering when I could get my next drink. I would've been stressed because I would already be counting down the hours until my husband got home from work and I needed to get to the liquor store to replace whatever I had been drinking - and how long is this friend planning on staying?!

It was such a relief when those feelings and memories passed. I realized I was in my clean house, because I clean a little bit everyday and it just doesn't get overwhelming anymore. I was showered and my hair was done. I just picked up a few baby toys off the floor, lit a candle, and started a pot of coffee. 

I have had set backs over the years, but I feel really good about mostly maintaining my sobriety. These little flashbacks are nice reminders to keep going. IWNDWYT",34

It is Saturday morning, I don’t have a hangover, had my black morning tea and getting ready to take my dogs out for a walk. I feel great, fantastic but most of all, I am so proud that I am able to reach this milestone. 

I first sobered up in rehab in 2013 and relapsed after my brother died as an addict. I was almost 4 years sober when I relapsed the first time. It was a terrible 2 years with various suicide attempts. I lost everything, but finally went to another rehab in 2019, which led to another 9 months of sobriety. But this was different from the first time. I was a dry drunk, unhappy, discontented and argued a lot with my sponsor. I gave in. Without anything and having moved back in with my mother, it was horrible. 

After that I tried time and time again and failed dismally. So here I am, another 5 weeks sober, but this time I feel different. I am putting in a lot of self care, self love and really looking after my mental health. Not only do I have a new sponsor, I am actively practicing the 12 step program of AA. I am also seeing a Psychologist regularly, Attending online meetings and doing some service. I am rebuilding my relationship with my higher power, continuously doing my gratitude list, affirmations and daily inventory as suggested by my sponsor. 

Morning meditation keeps me calm and focused on my goal for the day. Just for today, I will stay sober, stay away from that first drink, stay away from weekend Braai’s and friends I used to drink with. 

My kids and my partner need me in this state of mind and I am grateful I can be the good mother and partner I used to be. I am alive, sober and present for my family. Happy Saturday 20 November 2021. There is no reason to drink. ODAAT.",16

4 months feels really good and it feels so much better than drinking and smoking does. I don't miss it at all and plan to continue this way forever. I don't even think about them much at all. Weeks will go by without thinking about it. 

I feel like my brain has rewired itself and is continuing to rewire itself. This process takes time but one thing that works for me is not thinking about alcohol or nicotine. A couple days ago though I did see some cigarette imagery on the web and that night I had a smoking dream, but my smoking dreams are weird. I'm always seeking and planning on smoking but never smoke.

A big thing that works for me is to concentrate on other health aspects I want to improve on. That way I can focus on those and if i fail on those I can just keep trying and at the same time I'm not failing at alcohol instead. Not sure if that makes sense. Like I have been trying to exercise more and eat healthy and quite caffeine. These things keep me occupied and I've had my failures as well as progress on them in the 4 months I've been sober.

Quitting alcohol really helped my anxiety but at the start it increased my anxiety. There is all this science about GABA. Well it turns out that caffeine causes anxiety too (who would have thought). At least for some people, including me. Just youtube search ""coffee anxiety"" and you will see tons of people talking about how quitting caffeine lowered their anxiety to non-existent levels.

Anyways these are just my thoughts and opinions only and what work for me. I'm no doctor or expert at this.

Quitting alcohol can be tough but you can do it and more happiness will be waiting for you.",5

Ive worked a lot on my mental health. 

My birthday is coming up and I will be spending it with my family or at home. I know my friends may want to do something. I still get into bars(don’t ask me why) and still love socializing and being in the vibe and I guess I’m here to have someone validate me on not drinking alcohol on my birthday or even after I’m 21? 

I don’t think any of my family members would bring me alcohol because they all know I got a dui in the past so it’s just kinda..awkward? 

Yeaa I don’t think I will drink but I know if my grandpa offers me a drink, if I should decline.

Something interesting's happening as I'm nearing the month mark - I don't really think about it day-to-day anymore. I mean, I do, but instead of a romantic ""ahhh"" memory I'm starting to feel a kind of aversion to drinking.

It's not that I don't want it but I think being sober for a bit is making me remember how dozens of previous times I tried to quit it ended up becoming a failure and I'd end up deeper under than when I started. As a result, the whole thing has been such a huge pain in my ass that when I see booze now I remember how hard it was to quit and that's causing an aversive reaction.

You'd think it'd be the endless nausea, blackouts, cringe texts and calls, poor spending decisions, getting fired but nope... apparently the thing that is most important to me is not being annoyed at the colossal inconvenience that it is to quit again.",10

&#x200B;

I'm new here. I've been over one year without, but as you all know the battle is never truly over and I've been going through a really rough patch in life, bringing up all of those dark thoughts. Well, my situation is this: I play with a group of friends online and they started a thing that involves drinking. I've made it clear that I cannot be around them when they do that for my own safety (I've struggled with multiple addictions in the past and I don't want the trigger to make me want to do any of the other things I've worked so hard to quit) and what my feelings about it were, but they still go on as usual.

 I used to be able to play with 2 people in the group all the time, but I haven't been able to for awhile due to adult responsibilities and all because either I wasn't able to be there or they weren't. So, tonight they planned to do that and I haven't even seen these friends in over a month. So, I explained how I felt about it, how I was sad that I was losing time with not only my best friend of the group, but with the other friends in the group as well. 

I'm very new at talking about my feelings to others, so it's been hard to do that as it is, but I've been feeling so left out and lonely because of it and the only times I truly get to talk to these friends is when we/they all play and I bought this game to play exclusively with them. I want to hang out with them with no drinking involved, but I also know that the world doesn't revolve around me and that they have the right to have their fun. It's really frustrating because my best friend is the only friend that I felt comfortable with, in all circumstances, and now I'm sorta feeling rejected in favor of other friends and am now just sitting in my bed, alone while they're together and doing that",4

To the point where they're listening to phone calls I'm making with other people and conversations I'm having with other coworkers. A lot of the time if I get feedback from an actual boss later, I did fine, but things like that get to me much more than they probably need to. (Could be years of undiagnosed ADHD plus probably the years of drinking; at this point if someone treats me like I made a dumb mistake I immediately believe them without even questioning it, then I get SUPER ANGRY that they made me feel that way.)

Anyway this person called me out on something (that I again checked with boss later and I was fine) AND used me as an object lesson while I could still hear to a new employee about what not to do. Really laying it on about how I was creating extra work (by doing the thing my boss later said was fine) My temper immediately went up to about a  million, ngl. Plus it was right at the end of the day PLUS of all the days in the world, a different coworker randomly casually/jokingly offered me a can of beer on her way out the door from her shopping bag. I'm serious - I almost have to laugh at the timing.

Anyway, I did not take the second person up on the offer and I didn't pick anything up on the way home. I went harder than normal on my exercise to work out some of the lingering anger and am feeling good about not drinking, at least! I probably need to suss out an ongoing plan for that one coworker and my reactions to things like that, but at least I know I don't have to let it get me to drink.",4

I’d use it to motivate me to get off my ass and do something because every excuse to not workout was ultimately a lie to myself.

To switch it over to my stop drinking mindset I simply started viewing “reasons to drink,” as *excuses* and therefore **LIES.**

Couple of personal examples:

“Hard day at work, I could use a drink.”
* **LIE** Drinking would actually make a hard day a worse day, and ultimately an even harder next morning/day for myself.

“I did good today, I deserve a drink.”
* **LIE** Why would I ruin it by drinking? I don’t *deserve* a drink, I *want* a drink and am only looking for an excuse to do so.

It has really worked for me with whatever “reason” I can come up with as an excuse to drink, and has helped keep me on the ol’ wagon.

I’m even planning ahead of time to stop taking my antidepressant now so it’s out of my system on the 25th and I don’t have interactions.

I’m trying really hard to play the tape forward tho, and know Nov 26th I’m gonna be bloated and dehydrated and sad, and very hungover. Because now that I’m 30 apparently 3 shots is enough to make me hungover, literally. 

I can still have fun cooking, and listen to music and enjoy my family sober. Sober I’ll be able to enjoy my food, instead of choosing to drink more instead. I’ll be able to make memories with my kids instead of my night ending in a blur.

I’m talking about after working out, after cooking dinner, when it’s like 8pm, too early for bed but too late to do anything else and it’s dark and cold outside. What do you do when you’re not reaching for the red wine? (I’m trying to read or watch a movie but they both make me feel like I’m on a plane just trying to pass the time until I land)


Update: I walked around target, bought some colored pencils and a sketch pad and started learning how to draw flowers on YouTube.

I try to take comments like this in stride but i wonder how much time I need for people to stop asking them and take me seriously. So far I’ve been through my wedding, countless other weddings, pregnancy and a pandemic sober. I wonder how much more I’ll need to prove. 

But I digress. I try not to let other people’s opinions bother me. This trip has been amazing! I’ve been lucid to enjoy every moment, easily wake up early for activities, and have saved a boat load of money being sober. I love appreciating things as they are without worrying only about my next drink. Trust me when I say vacation really is better sober.

So I am very close to being 6 months sober and am feeling very good in my life. I don't feel like I need to take dating off the table, even though many in AA say not to drink in the first year (which actually isn't in the Big Book from what I've read!). I personally don't do AA and just try to use my own self awareness with what I can handle. So please, don't immediately jump to, ""Don't date!"" My heart is open to dating if it's the right situation with the right person.

I recently started visiting /r/femaledatingstrategy and think there's a lot of good posts over there about mental health that made me rethink when and how to bring up my recovery from alcoholism. I didn't look at it this way until now, but I think it's more or less sharing your medical history (IMO!).

I want to be mindful of when and how I bring this up for a few reasons:

1. I struggle with boundaries and often trauma bond with men.
2. I don't want someone to exploit me for my mental health issues.
3. I want to have better boundaries wherein I get to know someone AND THEN share about myself more.

Previously I had that I was sober on my profile, which I get some people are comfortable with doing, but given the above, I am not longer comfortable with it.

Would you all daters out there be willing to share when you bring up your sobriety in a dating situation?

I hope no one takes this post personally as I'm saying someone else's way is right or wrong. I'm just trying to figure how to figure out what works for me, and I'm not really sure of the answer!",3

My friend told me to help myself to their booze while they were gone (they didn't know that I was sober).

I was by myself. No one would have known if I drank. I totally could have gotten away with it, and lied to everyone who knew that I was sober.

Instead, I took a picture of the bar, with all of the full bottles of premium liquor, just sitting there. I sent that picture to my wife with a text that said, ""I really want to drink this stuff!""

But I did not drink. Shortly after sending that picture, my desire to drink went away.  I did not touch any of those bottles for the entire week that I was there.

Looking back, this was important because I was being honest. Part of me really did want to drink those bottles. When I was honest about that with myself, and someone else, I was holding myself accountable. For me, honesty has been one of the most important parts of my recovery.

In order to be honest, I need to stay sober. In order to stay sober, I need to be honest.

Update 2, If You Want Details: So, when we got there he asked me what I wanted to drink, and I followed the advice here and just told him straight up that I actually don't drink alcohol. So, he then said, ""Oh, that's fine! Do you want a mocktail?"" and then he tried really hard to get me one, but we were at a dive bar that really didn't have them, lol. I eventually just told him to get me a Coke and it would be fine, and it was. :)

First it was just some nights to numb me so i could sleep. Then it became every night and started drinking earlier and earlier. The last year or so ive drank everyday somedays more than others when i could. The last 6 months i consumed an average 12-15 beers a day. Sometimes id drink vodka a fifth or liter bottle but hard liquor just makes me feel like death and dont really enjoy the tastes of most liquor, so ive mostly stuck to beer. I practically failed out of college, lost lots of relationships, let my depression and anxiety hit rock bottom, out of shape and flabby, started balding at 23 probably from drug use, and feel like a total piece of shit. 

Whew.. I also smoke daily and thats been a habit for nearly 3 years. I also picked up vaping a year ago. Lots of great habits i formed over these last few years huh done percs enough times to know theyll kill me if i do those regularly. 

I just feel broke and lost, i was at a really good point in my life 2 years ago but i just fell apart. I atleast know what i need to do in order to get back on track. First thing is to get back to the gym and make that a habit again. I miss feeling good and having confidence from working out. Fix my shitty diet of nothing but junk food. Stop isolating myself so much and see what relationships i can fix. Some i dont want to fix, ive realized im friends with some people i dont truely enjoy and we haven't had a beneficial relationship in a long time. Go back to school in the spring and finally finish. Pick up new exciting hobbies and find some awesome people in the process. Hell maybe in 3 or 6 months start trying to date again if i can get my shit together.

One day at a time, im just scared how hard the depression and anxiety will hit these next few weeks.
I plan to quit vaping tomorrow aswell i haveenough juice for today then im throwing that shit out. Should save me a lot of money. Im not sure if i can give weed up rn but i dont want to use that as a crutch either.

2021-11-19 12:36:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qxl9n0/i_need_to_stop_drinking/,I need to stop drinking,"Hello stopdrinking community,

My story is not unique or special, but like many others I have come to the conclusion that my life would be better without alcohol. The path that I am on right now is unsustainable and will no doubt lead to greater problems longterm.

I didn't start drinking until I was 21. Through my 20s I had my share of ""dumb drunk moments,"" but thankfully nothing that was devastating to me or others around me. There would be times when I would drink too much, but I had no problem cracking open one beer any given evening and leaving it at that. 

Through my 30's though, something changed. Struggling with anxiety, depression, and the feeling that I failed in my first career choice (which is a long story not worth going into right now) I began to drink more. I'd throw down a shot at home with a couple beers. That turned into 2-3 shots over the years. 4-5 after that. Drinking 2 nights each week turned into 3-4 nights each week, and so on. 

So here I am at 39 years old and I don't want to enter my 40s with this burden on my shoulders. It's time to put the cork in the bottle for good. I've thought about this for a few years now and I recently heard that for most people it takes them six years to quit drinking from the the first time they start to consider it, so I'm hoping to be at that point where I can stop for good. 

I've tried cutting down. I've tried telling myself I'll only buy 4-5% beer, but then I just drink 11 to get where I want to be. I've said I'll only drink when going out with friends. But after one night at the brewery I inevitably justify it more and the one night out with friends turns into also drinking the next five nights at home. I've tried quitting completely before and have commented on posts here and there in this forum for motivation, but every time I get to 2-3 weeks I tell myself ""oh I don't have a problem because I was able to go three weeks"" and then I'm drinking 25 out of the next 30 days. 

I have a decent job where my performance has suffered because of my hangovers the next day. I've told myself that because of the pandemic this is OK, but it's been 18 months now and that excuse is ridiculous. I'm justifying my poor behavior.

Sorry for all the rambling. I wish I could write this in a way that was deep and meaningful, but I'm just trying to get this heavy stuff off my chest. I guess I'll leave it at this: I have an amazing wife and two lovely daughters. I can be a better husband and a better dad if I quit drinking. There is no question about that. I need to quit for that reason and so that I'm hopefully here on this earth as long as possible to be in their lives. The amount of energy and resources I put into drinking, thinking about drinking, planning life around drinking - all of this is ridiculous. It needs to stop. 

I will not drink with you today. Thanks for taking the time to read.",67

I think the hardest part of quitting drinking, for me, was admitting I needed to stop. Alcohol has been such a integral part of my life for so long. One of my first jobs was a craft beer manager at a liquor store. I got to go all around my state trying out different breweries and ordering all sorts of wonderful beers. My job since has been a bartender. Making different cocktails and learning about wines. I honestly loved alcohol, not just the drinking part (which clearly I loved entirely too much) but the process, the flavor profiles, everything. 

But if I'm being honest, which is a new thing I'm trying, even back in that first job in my early twenties I was drinking unhealthily. I would get way too drunk at those tasting, or the company parties. I would embarrass myself in front of my coworkers and people I was supposed to have a business relationship with. I just could never drink in moderation and that has never changed. That will never change. I will always be the drunkest person at the party. I simply cannot help myself. In AA terms, I am powerless, truly and deeply, over alcohol. 

Once I admitted I could not drink anymore the rest has been relatively easy. When I get a strong craving to drink (at my job where I am quite literally surrounded by alcohol) I just tell myself to wait 5 minutes and if it's still there we can think about it. Usually by the time the 5 minutes is up I've forgotten I even wanted to. Last night the battery of my car died parked on the street in front of a bar. I had to wait almost 2 hours for Triple A and I was tired and mad. I wanted to go sit in that bar more than anything but I sat my butt in my car and played phone games. A month ago me would have been drunk by the time the tow guy got there. Progress I guess. 

Thanks for letting me write these updates. It's been helpful and the idea of writing this one month post has kept me sober. I was excited to share this with you guys. I was excited to be proud of myself. I am proud of myself. And I'm proud of you, wherever you are in this journey. I raise a glass of Topo Chico to you, to me and to everyone who will not drink with us today. Cheers.",19

At about the same frequency, I drink before I have to do homework at night for my online grad school so I breeze through it without thinking too much, sort of greasing the wheels. I also drink because it seemingly makes social interactions more fun. But also, I don't know if that's true. I definitely leave parties earlier when I don't drink, and get plenty of social anxiety that's not there if I'm drunk. I also think I drink because I'm probably addicted to the stuff. There's that too. 

I just get exhausted when I'm sober and in these situations, and I get a pep in my step when I'm drunk. But then, the following morning, I'm filled with regret. It's not worth it, but in the moment it feels like a panacea. Ugh. 

I've cut down a lot though. I didn't drink at the concert I went to this week and had a magical time. Very pure experience. I was proud of myself. But then last night, I was tired from work and had to do a bunch of homework, so the drinking happened again. I don't know, man. I just want to stop but that urge is strong.",15

Every day, every hour, every second that we stay sober we are doing something that we should be proud of and if you're ever down or feeling caught in a rut I highly recommend looking on your sobriety with a sense of pride for just a little bit as a reminder you can handle the other things life is throwing at you.",26

I am a 1-2 bottle of wine a day drinker and I've been trying a little bit of everything to moderate.  I got on the Kratom forum and tried that...and I began reading about how THAT can be addictive so I got scared and stopped.

I started AA and not sure how that will end up.  But, I wanted to repeat something that helped me yesterday as I was reading a book called Atomic Habits.  He said our actions are the results of our beliefs.

For example, someone offers you a drink:  ""no thanks, I""m trying to stop."" 

Versus ""No thanks, I don't drink"".

We have to retrain our unconscious thoughts.  I really believe that is true because that is exactly how I was before I formed an addiction to alcohol.  I held a negative mindset to getting buzzed or drunk.  I wish that never changed...  but it is proof to me that I need to reframe my thoughts, just as Allen Carr talks about in his book.

That is why I struggle with AA.  I don't want to think it's one day at a time...It's got to be concrete thought for me and not a shiny object that I'll never get to touch again.

Usually it was cereal or pop tarts as I lay on the couch feeling miserable and trying to muster up the energy to start the day. I wouldn't eat breakfast at all. But I would certainly have my first beer by 11 am. To 'cure the hangover.' Shameful to look back on but it's my shame and I own it and am happy to be reflecting on it as opposed to still living it. 

The first week it was a massive breakfast casserole with all kinds of goodies, last weekend was French toast, tomorrow I will be whipping up one of my all time favorites, huevos rancheros. Usually my 3 year old daughter will get up with me and help as I sip coffee and she has her 1/2 water, 1/2 apple juice while my wife and son sleep in until the food is ready.

It's such a simple thing but it's one that I treasure and now look forward to with great anticipation. Being sober is so much more relaxing and rewarding than a six pack every night through the week and binge drinking all weekend. What a waste of time and energy.

Once again, and as always, thank you to this community. I've never seen such a group of individuals willing to bare their souls so willingly.

It’s been a while since I made a post in this sub and I hope everyone is doing well on their individual journeys.

Last night, I gave in to my girlfriend’s guilty pleasure of watching the reality TV show “Below Deck” which documents how the crew on a Super Yacht function with some typical reality TV show drama spins…

Well, on the episode we watched last night — one of the guests on the yacht was a completely blacked out asshole. The guy was throwing back whiskey like it was water and eventually ended up in the place a lot of us are / were familiar with.

He made a complete ass out of himself and the next morning, had no idea why everyone hated him.

This was me. I was the guy who blacked out, woke up feeling like trash and with a HUGE amount of shame.

As I’m watching this more than 2 years sober, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for the drunk and relate to their feels of taking drinking too far and having a lot of regrets. After I felt sorry, I transitioned to a place of personal pride.

That person was me, but no longer is me and I couldn’t be more thankful for the 2+ years I’ve been off the bottle.

I hope this post resonates with someone who is struggling or provides encouragement for someone who is well into their journey.

I stopped my drinking 60 days ago because my weekends had turned to binges then multi-day benders. Think I was self medicating my anxiety and depression after a few months of repeated bad news at work and with family. Consulted my doctor and got on an antidepressant, which helped make my first 30 go by easier than previous attempts to stop which lasted 5 days or less.

Just some other things I noticed:
-A lot of annoyances and stressors are still in life, but I am reacting better with a clear mind. Also working on some of my own bad habits, they’re still here and can’t explain them away as alcohol related.

-Nonalcoholic beer is something I should have tried sooner. One or two keep my urges sated whereas I was practically guzzling liquor and felt like there was no end.

-Finding support is a huge deal. Someone from r/thewire referred me here after I commented on a post comparing a character’s drinking and my own. To whoever that was, I am thankful. Stopping on here for 5 minutes to read will dispel drinking desires or anxieties I may be feeling. 

-Work on one thing at a time. Some people seem to be able to stop/quit drinking and do a lot of other positive changes…I could only focus on one thing (not drinking) and slowly add to it. Beating myself up didn’t help, found it better to use that energy on anything else. 

I’ll stop after those thoughts for now, thanks to everyone on here. My current goal is to make it to 90 days (which is just before Christmas), and evaluate if I’m ready to go back to moderate drinking (if i even feel like doing it). For now, IWNDWYT.",11

I very rarely post any comments online but as I had my first day in ages without drinking yesterday (which I put down to the inspiration I got on here) I thought I would. And I'm not gonna drink today!! So thanks:)

Drinking has kept me hiding away from life for quite a while. It's time to take positive steps away from my drinking problem otherwise I will slip up again, and I am getting worried about the state of my liver. I am drinking about 90 units a week at the moment so it can't be doing it much good!

I work 4 on 3 off. My days off are just spent drinking at home. Things took a turn for the worse in the Lock-down when I started 'Morning Cocktails' after stumbling on a YouTube channel. Everyone was joking in the comments about which ones they were making etc etc...I didn't need much encouragement:) I never drank in the morning before that but now its become the norm. I can see that this is only going one way unless I do something.

I did stop for three months in Feb this year after scaring myself by considering driving under the influence and then calling in sick for work. I felt like such a scum bag after that that I promised myself 'I am NOT gonna be THAT guy' over and over. The humiliation I felt gave me wings and I stopped there and then.

Initially I didn't miss it at all. But after three months I was just bored. I had failed to create new habits in retrospect and I think that derailed me. I remember the conversation in my head the night I gave in. Feeling lonely and bored and wanting some kind of a blast. Reminiscing on younger days, parties...fun. Then the voice started 'Just have a couple then?' (me) no!,no way! it always ends up the same. (voice) Are you trying to tell me that you can't have a couple and stop!? (me) of course I can what are you saying! (voice) Ok! come on then!! (me) Ok! I'll prove you wrong! Fast forward 12 hours, extremely hung over and regretful and drinking daily until writing this 7 months later...a couple of drinks my arse!!

With enough motivation I have stopped multiple times in the past but I always seem to start again, that's my problem. I was watching a lot of Youtube vids on stopping drinking yesterday and I think I need to look deeply at my life and where I want it to be in the not to distant future, a bit of reorientation.

I’m up 30 lbs, I drink nightly, I hate myself. I buy bottles of wine and drink them, order more on door dash. I call out of work because I’m too hungover. I’m a shell of myself. I read the post about someone having cancer and wished it was me. I know, I’m awful. I spent 2000 for the premium subscription to this naked mind, which I actively ignore. What am I waiting for? What am i doing? I know my husband isn’t happy with my behavior. Am I trying to get him to hate me? I don’t know what happened and I just feel I’m reaching the end with no hope. Maybe this will have to kill me. I’m sorry for being so negative but this is what’s happening in my mind every day. I have no hope that I could ever get well even if I want to. My job in the military limits the help I can get for mental health, and I’ve given up fighting with them. They would rather see me drink myself to death then truly help me. I feel like it’s over for me and I just want to crawl into a hole and never be seen or spoken of again.",38

Just want to share how much I’ve enjoyed learning about this sub and the overall positivity on it.  It’s an awesome community.  

I’m 11 days in.  About a year ago I quit for a month, although in hindsight that wasn’t actually something I *wanted* to do at the time, and at least right now, this go-around feels very different. 

My story is one that I’ve read more than a few times on here - currently 36, started drinking as a teen, that evolved to heavy binge drinking at college, which shifted to drinking whenever I could post college.  For a long time, drinking felt like something I liked to do but felt like I had a handle on.  Over the last 1-2 years, it transformed into a feeling of dependency and imprisonment - I probably had alcohol running through me at some point almost daily for the last few years, aside from the month break in 2020.  And most of the time I was hiding it - sneaking out to the store, grabbing tall boys.  Drinking in my garage after work, etc.  

My fiancé basically caught me in the act on 11/8, and the next day I reached out to a primary care doc to schedule an appointment - in part because I hadn’t seen a doctor in years, and also because I wanted to be up front about and get guidance for alcohol abuse.  I came home from work and told her that I was scheduling the doc visit and planned to quit for good. The doc visit in itself was something of an accomplishment - not just for acknowledging my alcohol issues but also just getting a blood panel done and finding out what the hell is happening on the inside.  I felt proud of myself for doing that, I felt like I was taking accountability for my body in a way I just have not done enough.

Still, it’s been a rough 2 weeks on the relationship front.  While opening up about my problems was weirdly liberating to me, it was a total shock to the system to the fiancé.   She couldn’t bring herself to intimacy (like, a hug) for 4-5 days.  I don’t really know for sure at this point if she’ll be able to get past the breakdown in trust, but I am going to try to be the best version of myself and try to get to know myself better in the process of doing so (the booze definitely inhibited a detached existence), which I hope will allow me to become a better partner. 

Along with working on the mental health aspect, I signed up for a personal trainer about 3 weeks ago, and have dropped about 10 lbs over the last week (news flash, drinking 4-8+ IPAs, along with whatever else you can get your hands on, for a year straight is not good for your fitness).  I had put on about 30-35 lbs over the last few years, which was basically all beer gut. 

So far I’ve shared the journey with 5 of my friends, who were all supportive.  

All that is to say, things are going well overall.  I’m optimistic about the future but am not anticipating it will be a cakewalk.  At some point the momentum and passion won’t be the same, and that’s something I need to be ready for.  Next week I’ll be spending several days at the fiancé’s parents - their family are heavy drinkers, and I’m not sure I’m ready to open up to them at this point.  Finding a counselor is a next step.  I’m also working though emotions around attending AA.  I know it’s not something I should be ashamed of, but the term alcoholic still feels stigmatized to me.  And I do think I need to “fall in love with myself” and figure out the underlying drivers for my drinking head on.   Lots of things to figure out.  

Anyways, it feels like I wrote a lot.  But it felt great to share.",9
2021-11-19 02:21:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qxavwk/the_daily_checkin_for_friday_november_19th_just/,"The Daily Check-In for Friday, November 19th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

How does Check-in work for me?

When I first found this sub, having searched the phrase Stop Drinking, all I wanted was a place where the focus was on abstinence, not on moderation.  I was well and truly done with the myth of moderation.  I wanted to get on with my life, and stop being a prisoner to all this drama.

Just like all the previous times I quit, I got my fizzy water and the sweeties ready, and I was all psyched up.  I found Check-In, and I thought, yes, daily accountability, that's what I need.  I’ll be able to find out how long these night sweats will last, and maybe discover a good over-the-counter medication that could help me sleep?

But what was all his self exploratory stuff??  The host was talking about the reasons why he thought he became addicted to alcohol, and people were responding with tales of family and trauma. And I thought to myself, if you’ll pardon my Irishness, what a load of bollocks!  I was here because I’m an extrovert, with too much money to spend on partying-I don't need self-analysis.  But, everyone seemed nice, so I’ll play nice.

And of course, you know the rest.  I came here thinking I just needed to rid my body of alcohol, but my success so far is because I worked on what was going on in my head too.  Day by day, some topics electrified me, some days they baffled me.  Some days I throw down a quick IWNDWYT, some days I spend 2 hours sharing and cheering posters on.  

To sum up, my secret to sobriety is that you need to have both your head and your ass in the game. I may have been reluctantly dragged on board, but that's been the change for me, and it was about time!

Have a great Friday!",302
2021-11-19 02:17:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qxau39/life_is_not_boring_anxiety_fueling_stressful_etc/,"Life is not boring, anxiety fueling, stressful etc. it’s the brain that experiences it","A drunk like me says that ”life is too boring without alcohol”. It’s not life, it’s the brain that experiences life.

The brain has downregulated dopamine = things don’t feel as interesting or motivating. This doesn’t mean life has little to offer, but what the drunk is able to grasp while experiencing it.

It takes time for dopamine receptors to readjust. PAWS takes time (4 months - 2 years)

It’s the same with imbalance of GABA and glutamate = going towards life more anxious and irritated, this affects the end result.

The same with messed up endorphines and high cortisol = More feelings of dysphoria, life feels cold and threatening, stressful, this affects the end result.

Alcohol messes up male and female hormones as well = hormonal depression

Also, how dopamine works is, that as it’s released it feels rewarding AND causes wanting of wherever you were as it was released. Impossible to have one without the other = Life feels already grim and the brain subconsciously wants to go wherever dopamine was released -> alcohol.

So then the drunk like me goes around saying this is all boring, anxiety fueling and irritating, cold and threatening, nothing rewards me and all I want to do is drink. 

Alcohol has tricked the drunk into a rut, the only way out is to put the bottle away, accept the gray clouds and wait for the sun to shine through. It’s not as bad as the emotional brain makes it out to be. Look at the objective, hardly ever things are terribly wrong around, it’s in the head. Wait and the sun starts to shine through ✨ That’s all there is to it. One day at a time.

I gave up drinking for myself, but my wife has been very supportive of it. When I mentioned to her that I was contemplating drinking this weekend - she said, ""absolutely! If that's what you want to do, go for it!""  


She then reminded me how much value I have placed on my length of sobriety thus far, and that she knows I won't personally be capable of pretending it ""didn't count"", and that I would force myself to reset my clock. She also reminded me that without having drank in almost half a year, my tolerance is probably non-existent, and I will likely try drink as much as I used to. Which will lead to all the things I hated about being drunk. Slurring, inappropriate jokes, etc.  


Neither of us were worried that this weekend would be a trigger to go back to my old ways - even if I did drink this weekend. I think I'm far past that point for myself.   


The crux is, I just needed the reminder that there is no upside to drinking this weekend. Even if I have one drink, and nothing else. I would still reset my clock. All the progress would be gone. And for what? I'd be left with nothing but regret over a few fleeting moments of ""fun"".  


I know I'm rambling. I'm just very glad to have a spouse that supports either decision I make, but will always try to push me in the direction that I personally decided was best for me.  


Happy weekend, folks!

I'm coming back from a relapse after three years of sobriety. Before that I had a relapse of a year and a half following a year and a half of sobriety, and before that were some shorter stints of sobriety interspersed with periods of drinking. And before all of *that* were some years of variously trying and failing to control my drinking, take breaks from drinking, and sticking my head in the sand and pretending that I could make drinking work for me. I've been trying to deal with my drinking problem longer than I was actually just straight up drinking.

It's humbling and a little disheartening to be counting days again. I really thought that I had it nailed the last time and I was on the right path, but as I'm doing a little soul searching around what went wrong I can see that there's some lessons that I had left to learn. Anyway, I made it back, and that's genuinely what matters, but it's still been a little hard to look at where I am.

But I had the realization sitting in a meeting tonight that I'm so flipping grateful that I spent the last however many years stumbling towards sobriety. I didn't get sober and stay sober on the first try, or the tenth try. But I kept trying. 

And I know how my drinking was heading. If I hadn't been trying to get sober all those years, I would be dead by now. Every time that I hear about someone who's found alone in an apartment with a bunch of empty bottles around them, I know that that's the path that I was on. I was still keeping up appearances, very few people in my life had any idea that I had a serious drinking problem, and I could generally pass as someone who had their stuff together. But behind the scenes I was dying inside and gearing up to drink myself to death.

And I'm not there today. I've got eighteen days of continuous sobriety under my belt and I'm not drinking myself to death. I kept coming back and trying again. It wasn't an instant fix by any stretch of the imagination, but it's nothing like what it would have been like if I hadn't been trying at all and I just kept drinking. There is value in the fight. I may not be where I wanted to be, but I'm not where I could have been, and I'm extremely grateful for that.

Thank you all for being on this journey with me, sobernauts. Sending hugs to all y'all.

In my case, life has greatly improved overall and I'm proud of who I am becoming,  but now the crutch I leaned on is no longer a part of my life. 
So I'll preface this by saying I don't know any results yet, and it may seem innocuous to you. I went to my dentist for a cleaning about six months ago,  and he saw some areas on my throat that concerned him, and he wanted me to go to a specialist to get them checked out. My wife and I had a ton of travel, and work was insane, so it slipped my mind. I ended up going for another cleaning, the same areas were there, so I followed up with the specialist and had a biopsy today.
I am freaking the fuck out. My mother died of cancer when I was young and I basically watched her waste away over the course of a year....I also have a lost of family members on that side who have battled or died from cancer. My mind is stuck on the worst case scenarios and I have to mentally just sit in it. This is usually a situation where I would buy as many cases of beer as I could afford or hit up the bar and get numb, and there's a part of me that sounds really nice to right now.
What has comforted me in spite of the above is thinking about how insane it is that I haven't drank in a year. I'm not a big social media guy outside of here, and I mentioned it in some other places...the kind words and support I got back is really lifting me up a bit. My wife told me that she's proud of me and how good a job I did in addressing my use once I ""came out"" as an alcoholic. I even practiced some advice I saw on here and got myself a few gifts for my soberversary: some Athletic Brewing Until Dawn and a new coat (replacing my old proverbial 'beer coat'). I'm rambling now but I guess my larger point is that I'm so glad this place exists and has taught me some ways to find daylight when the world gets dark. IWNDWYT",89

He left last night. I’m over 60 days in and have been doing really well, but I’ve been having thoughts all week of “I could totally get some beer or wine and he would never know.”

I talked to my therapist about it the other day, how it’s just been a thought and I haven’t acted on it but I don’t like that my mind went there. She said that it could be the start of the pink cloud dissipating and that it would be a good time to really think about all of the good things that I’ve done in the last 60 days. 

Would the satisfaction of drinking a bottle of wine or a bunch of beers and having that drink feeling be worth the hangover the next day? Would it be worth the guilt I would feel and the anxiety that I would have? 

My partner is staying the rest of the weekend with me starting tomorrow night which will help. I think the issue is that I’m home alone right now. I’m trying to brush the thoughts away but damn is it hard. 

I really don’t want to drink with you all today.",9

I remember at 15 yo my first drinking session, I was usually shy and quiet kid, suddenly I took this heavy % beer and became very loud, funny and social. It was a blast. 

Then comes weekend drinking sessions with friends, because I'm bigger then them I'm known to be the ""guy who drinks the most"" . I had fun drinking them all under the tables, but some behaviors started to show that I wasn't proud off and some blackouts. I also started to gain a lot of weight.

Then colleges comes, where partying is glorified, pretty much any events involves alcohol and I use it to be more friendly or so I think. I drink a lot at each of these events, sometimes making a fool of myself and of course never stopping. Problem is in college, sometimes these events are during the week, many times a week. Drinking becomes the norm, drinking games, heavy binge drinking. Again I am known to be a big beer drinker because of my tolerance. 

Here comes graduation, suddenly drinking heavily is not well seen. Most of my friends cut down on the drinking not me. I always had anxiety and other issues, it's obvious alcohol made me numb to some of these issues. I had a tough start of career. Seeing a lot of sick ppl, being under extreme pressure. I would start using alcohol at the end of the day to relax. 

Fast forward early 30s, my body is starting to hurt a lot in different way. Doctor tell me my liver enzymes are up and I should cut drinking. It's very hard. It's a way of living. Going a weekend without a binge session to relax ? How is that even possible? I think to myself...

A couple of times I went 2-3 weeks without drinking but always went back. For now I'm in a new start day 4. Lately I've been needing a lot more alcohol each binging session. It takes me a lot more time to recover, starting to affect my life in different ways, also having no energy for couple of days and anxiety and depression flare up.

Lately I've been to a couple of events where I felt I drank way too much compare to ""normal ppl"" i.e downing a bottle of wine while ppl are still in their first/2nd glass...
One good thing is I stopped drinking hard alcohol in my early 20s because I was going crazy on it and realized it was too dangerous for me. Microbreweries are my thing. 

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while. One quote I really enjoy is heavy drinking is borrowing happiness from the next day, that's very true. 

Do I plan to stop forever ? Not for now, but one day at a time. 
Thursday night are usually now a drinking night, but not today instead I am writing this.

Edit: my badge says 80 but I think this is my 81st day technically, I believe that's how I've set it up. All my apps say 81. Who's counting?

Id love to say it is cause I stopped drinking, but I really have been slammed at work and don't truly FEEL like I've been putting in more effort. 
I'm a happier person, nicer to customers (I'm in banking), but haven't been getting along with my coworkers since I quit drinking. I've been standing up for myself more and not giving in to gossip or sitting around and chatting all day. 
I will admit I'm such an open book about sobriety (I quit drugs when I was 19) so everyone knows, but I'm not pushy or pretentious about it at all. 
I even recently got talked to for cursing on the job when I was upset about a schedule issue...
So it really hit me out of the blue, I want to thank being alcohol free, I really really do! But I'm not sure if that's it.

What I will say to tie this back into sobriety is this: I'm genuinely excited for this promotion and to learn more about banking, while before I would have been overwhelmed and upset because I wouldn't have thought I could handle it. Now I know I can, and why the hell wouldn't I be capable of learning something new? 

As always, thanks for letting me vent!

I've known I was attracted to guys since I was 14, but there was some kind of issue, probably rooted in my upbringing and also the expectations I made of myself, that made me try to deny that for years. I finally admitted at 21 that I'm gay and that wasn't going to change, as annoying as it is to be the odd man out. And admitting you're not who you thought you'd be? Holy fuck that takes a toll.

That realization was why I made dumbass decisions for a while. My anxiety issues mounted and mounted - what I used to feel fine with sober then took three drinks to feel fine with doing again, then gradually took 7, then gradually I became incapable of doing basic fucking functions that should have been easy, especially with supportive family and friends.

I never really recovered from realizing how much better alcohol would make me feel. I've hear the phrase ""First the man takes the drink,"" which maybe explains where I was with booze at first. Then, ""the drink takes a drink,"" which I have to admit I'm at now. And then ""the drink takes the man."" I'm fighting to not fall into that shit. I feel confident that one day I'll be there, that I can do it. But, it's been a bitch. Right now I feel I've got 2 steps in front of me: 1) Quit without fucking up your life, and 2) Find a way to stay on the otherwise good aspects of your wagon. I'm a law student on scholarship now. I haven't ruined my life. And I don't want to ever hit that hard of a rock bottom, God bless those of you who have.",6

I glazed over all of mine and sort of disconnected as I was saying them (another way to avoid feeling the hard things). But I realized I forgot to add a huge loss- when I saw my brother’s body after he died. They tried to make him look presentable but his face was smashed and swollen. It was horrific, and he looked nothing like my dear brother. Suffice to say, it was a tough group meeting tonight. Very raw- and I allowed myself to feel it. I’m now home and am itching for a glass of wine - as a reward of sorts. (And of course, one glass turns into one bottle). I am writing here to vent and remember why I stopped drinking to begin with. I hurt others and I hurt myself. I wasn’t growing or healing. I was avoiding. I want the wine, but I want the growth more. And I’m here to say that tonight.

Reading people’s stories on here is what originally motivated to quit. I made this account as throwaway account so that I could post here without my coworkers knowing. Now, this account is my main account, it’s my cake day, and I haven’t had a drop of alcohol in over One Year.

To all of the kind people who gave me advice and took the time to leave comments  on my early posts — you have no idea how much you helped me. I am so grateful that I found this community, and I cannot believe how long it has been since I drank. 

I remember how literally impossible giving up alcohol seemed. I remember crying and legitimately thinking that my body and my mind could not exist in this world without alcohol. 

Not drinking ever again, or even reaching a milestone like One Year, was something that I couldn’t wrap my head around. It was intimidating, and it made me feel hopeless because it seemed like a mountain that I couldn’t climb. Thankfully, my mind set shifted thanks to this sub. I don’t think of my sobriety as some lofty, unattainable thing. Instead, I wake up every morning and make the conscious decision not to drink — just for that day.

I’m not trying to suggest that this year has easy, and I would never claim that giving up alcohol solves everything. But I can absolutely, unequivocally say that if I was still drinking now, everything that I am going through in my life would be much, much worse. 

If you are reading this and you’re feeling hopeless, like you want to stop drinking, but you don’t think that you can — please believe me when I say you CAN do this. If you decide not to drink, even just for one day, then you are on your way to a major victory.

Ok this is absolutely my biggest accomplishment and I'm insanely proud of myself. I have done more in those 5 years than I have in the previous 27 years of my existence. I got a Bachelor's degree, a Master's degree, I moved 4 times, I went on vacation to 4 different countries, I learned Spanish ( I even have a girlfriend from Peru lol) and I learned how to draw (I'm still not that great but I'm much better than I was when I started). I still have anxiety and get bouts of depression, and I still have insecurities but they are wayyy less intense now. I feel incredible just feeling normal. Just being not hungover is an amazing feeling. Overall life has been awesome these past 5 years and I don't even want to imagine what a piece of garbage it would have been had I continued drinking. I even have a baby! she was born in September and as long as I stay vigilant I don't see why she'll every have to know the drunk side of her dad. 

&#x200B;

Now, having said that, that doesn't mean everything is completely hunky dory all the time. I'm still really bad at letting go of regret. I started drinking at 12/13 and didn't stop till i was 27. My entire formative years were a blur. I feel this has really hindered me developmentally and some days I just have no idea who I am. I very much regret having gotten such a late start in life because now it's making finding a job difficult. I feel like I was just standing around at the starting line of a race while everyone else took off at the sound of a gunshot and I didn't start running until they all finished their second lap. I know this is the wrong way to look at it, and that I should just be grateful that I'm not dead or in jail, which I am, believe me, but I can't help feel that life could have been even better had I never fucked up so hard in the first place. I come from an upper middle class family and had every opportunity to do whatever I wanted but I fucked it up. again, Just being honest. I also still get cravings but they are very very rare, and I am an expert now at playing the tape forward. I am fully aware that there is no such thing for me as one drink, and that if I do drink then I am going right back to that garbage life and garbage person and there's no way in hell I'd give up everything that I have now. It took literally about 1000 attempts to finally get sober. I'm not even kidding, I failed 1000 times before I finally managed to do it. If this is something you really want to do, if this is something you NEED to do, Don't ever give up.

One of the things I was worried about getting sober is that I wouldn't be fun, funny, or interesting anymore. First of all, I think I'm way more interesting now that I've developed skills and interests besides just drinking. I'm still hilarious and fun, I'm just present and conscious. I've also saved sooo much money. God the amount of money I wasted on this shit...

I went in today and spoke to my doctor for the first time about my drinking problem. She was so understanding and kind about the situation it made me wonder why I delayed it for so long. I walked out of there feeling so relieved to finally be proactive in getting the help I need.

And another piece of advice from experience… if you feel you have a drinking problem and go for a blood test that comes back with a good result, I promise you this is not an excuse to say “Phew! Well shit, back to the bottle then!”

Take that good result and run with it. Trust me, I wish I had the first time. I wish I had the second time. If I get another good result, I’m keeping it that way. Because if I don’t stop, eventually I’ll start to watch those results deteriorate. It would only be a matter of time.

Really good times. 

Here, I was fine through the day and even through happy hour, but once all the socializing was over, I wanted nothing more than to go down to the bar, have 3 glasses of wine and take a nightcap up to my room. Just like old days. I would have been loaded and extremely hungover in the morning. 

You know how in mindfulness therapy, you are supposed to observe your thoughts? Well, I was able to observe that pesky, intrusive thought, think about the “HALT” factors, and then figured out where it came from. I was tired from the networking… and more than that, I was lonely.

I am a binge alcoholic, of course probably with some pshycotic issues that need to be addressed. I say that because why else would I drink so much at one time and why would I subject myself to that. I really have no clue.

I can go for months heck I have gone almost 2 years without alcohol and then bam. Ok I can have one, next time three and then bam 40 drinks and black out. I end up losing the trust that my wife and family had in me. Because when I am hammered drunk I make seriously poor decisions. Don't know how I am not dead or in jail sometimes. 

I have recently done this and just looking for others who might be in the same boat as me and maybe shed some light on why I am this way.

I’d also not eaten much this morning and had too much coffee and my 8-month-old isn’t sleeping so neither am I, etc etc.

Do I need to talk to someone about it? And is AA a good vehicle for that, or should I just talk to people when I'm ready? I just don't want to relapse, I feel like I'm in a good place.

Also shout out to the National Suicide Hotline 800-273-8255 I was always so afraid to call because I wasn't ""that depressed"" turns out I am that depressed and it is a fantastic resource for anyone to have. They were caring, took their time, and we're completely non judgmental. I also learned that the number isn't just for if you're feeling suicidal. If you are feeling like you need a drink, or are going to self harm, or are just having a truly shit day they are there for you 24/7.

Saw some posts recently about being “Cali sober”. 
Firstly I live in Canada and cannabis is legal here. I’ve been struggling with alcohol addiction for at least 10 years and I haven’t been very successful in quitting, despite my strongest efforts. I’m starting a new medication where drinking is highly not recommended, and that’s all good and well, but I suffer from pretty horrible pain as a result of breaking my femur when I was much younger. I get home from work at 3pm most days and I don’t sleep well/much so I try to stay up until midnight most nights so I’m not tossing and turning all night, full of anxiety. Alcohol has been my go to, up until now. 
I can’t handle 8 or more hours sober and in pain, every evening,  unable to really do anything aside from watch tv (I don’t play video games and don’t own any game consoles). I’m trying to get away from smoking, but I think a very low dose edible might be ok. Need advice on where to buy and what to get. 
Also used to be a huge pot head in my younger years but now I get bad anxiety when I smoke. Any advice is appreciated.",9

**TW: sexual assault / rape / self-harm / discussion of suicide**

Yesterday was a several year anniversary of me surviving being raped. I usually celebrate this day by drinking with friends. Not yesterday. Stayed sober & spent the day crocheting a blanket & enjoying delicious food with my partner. 

That was easy enough to get through without drinking, I guess. 

But at some point in the early evening, we found out a very close friend of ours relapsed & was planning suicide. They also posted increasingly inflammatory things about all of the friend group on their public social media. It's so difficult to be powerless in that type of situation.

This morning they have been located & are apparently safe, so at least I'm not waking up to a death announcement. 

What a fucking hell of a day. I am grateful for sobriety, and worried for my friend. 

That's all, I suppose. Thank you for being here with me, stranger friends.

I have not had a drink in 2 years and 9 months. I also stopped using marijuana when I stopped drinking.

Last night I relapsed and smoked some weed. A neighbor in my building was having major issues and the police were called. After things settled down my heart was racing and I couldn’t calm down. I was also stressing about a medical procedure I have tomorrow. I was texting with another neighbor (unrelated to the problematic neighbor) and said I wished I still drank so I could have a beer. I don’t know them well and they are unaware of my sobriety other than me saying I wish I still drank. They invited me over to smoke a joint with them instead and I did. 

I’m not sure why I did it. I haven’t been craving any substances at all. But last night it was like boom. It hit me hard and I convinced myself a few puffs wasn’t a big deal especially because I wasn’t drinking. 

The neighbor with the issues has caused problems many times before so that wasn’t a new trigger. The medical procedure is not new either, I have to do it every 5 weeks. 

The weed made me feel relaxed and euphoric. I felt mad that I can’t continue to partake casually. It was a good reminder of why it’s dangerous. 

I’m just feeling really bad about myself and scared because I felt so safe before. I don’t understand what happened. Now I realize my sobriety isn’t as strong as I thought.

One of my parents is an alcoholic and the other let me know they had binge drinking problems in their 20’s like I do. That parent picked me up from the hospital once, due to alcohol. That was a few years ago. I’ve taken breaks from drinking, 3 months was the longest…. Do I sound crazy? Am I fooling myself?? I want to try to just cut down…. But I don’t even know if it will work. Any success stories about cutting down would be appreciated. I am in my mid/ late 20’s and I really do enjoy going out with friends and drinking but I am done blacking out.

Boy did I feel called out. It made me realize that in all of the negotiations and parleys with my alcoholism, that I effectively had as much freedom as a child alone on the first night without a babysitter. 

Anyway, attended my first Zoom meeting today. It was terrifying at first, but holy smokes was everyone kind and respectful. I was called upon to speak but noted that it was my first time and I was just there to listen, and I was THANKED! Thanked for being there. I can't remember the last time I thanked myself for making a trade-deal with beer.

Anyway, just needed somewhere to put this. Thank you for reading <3",62

The song they named their group after, is about a man that meets a bum on the docks.

I've got no dime, but I've got some time to hear a story."" 

I don't want to tell the whole ""story"" here, but I want to link the song. I tried singing this song at open mic the week I quit drinking and couldn't make it through to the end without sobbing like a baby. Would love to hear ya'lls thoughts on it.

Alcohol was my primary method of combating the derealization, I’d use it to ‘strategically’ fuel feelings of apathy.

It's going to be my first time all alone, without my kids or husband to help ground me, and I guess the whole concept is kinda' wigging me out. I thought I'd be chill about it, but as the time to leave gets closer, I find the nervousness creeping in. Usually, when I'm feeling like I can't trust myself, I leave my ID at home or with my husband because despite being 30, I still get carded for cough syrup. However, I need my ID to take this exam tomorrow at 8AM.

I might actually do it this time.,"I've tried so hard for the last 10 years to shake this addiction. Or, maybe if I'm honest, I haven't tried hard enough. It hasn't hurt enough. I've told myself over and over that I'm not as bad as ""those other *actual* alcoholics"". You know, the ones that start in the morning, drink all day and black out every night... those losers. I'm not like that. I've got it under control. I don't day drink. I don't ever drink to complete oblivion. I don't ever miss work. I have a beautiful wife and 2 kids that still love me. Except I don't have it under control. I'm the same as everyone else in this predicament. I'm no better, and maybe a bit worse for thinking I wasn't as bad as those other losers. I'm just dancing the same dance to a different genre of music.  The song always ends the same...  no matter the beat, the night ends, the morning comes and it starts again. I drink every night. I hide it very well. So well that I think the ""me"" my wife now knows is actually this anesthetized shadow of me that bears very little resemblance to the man she fell in love with and had children with. The metamorphosis has been so slow and gradual, it's gone un-noticed. At least not consciously noticed. I'm kidding myself. Of course it's been noticed. Yet she still loves me. My kids still look up to me. But I *know*.  I *know* I can do better for them. I want the passion my relationship once had. I want my kids to FEEL the difference. I want them to not ask me why my breath smells funny when I kiss them goodnight at bedtime. I want to be alive for my kids in 20 years. If i carry on like this, I may not be.

So. IWNDWYT. It's been over 36 hours since my last drink. Maybe somewhat fitting, as my wife and I had shared a bottle of wine night before last and then made love, and it's just plain embarrassing to say I was mostly useless in that department. I've forgotten how sex feels sober. I can't wait to find out.

I am tracking my daily progress on a whiteboard, surrounded by photos of my family... my primary reasons to succeed. I was going to attach a photo of this, but it seems I cannot post pics here?

Anyway, thanks for reading and I'm SO looking forward to your support. I've been lurking for months trying to figure out how to start. But yesterday I started and I put my first tick in box #1 today. It feels good. I'm excited.",11

2021-11-18 11:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qwt2fe/one_fucking_year_sober/,One fucking year sober,"Hey y'all. I just turned 28 and a week later I hit one year sobriety after 15 years of being a fucking animal. So this was two days ago. I treated myself to a solo roadtrip to one of my favorite spots. I wanted some time alone and to reflect. It was a beautiful morning and looking out over this stunning red rock view. It was a difficult hike that even now I struggled with. If got to the top of the Vista I sat down and was dreading the reflection I was about to have. I started reading my journal for the last 13 months. It was filled at the start with regret and send loathing and honestly a lack of desire to wake up in the morning. I read through me feeling sick, the cravings, the non-existent sleep. How the desire to drink was so intense it was all I could think about so I had to keep myself busy. 

But then I started crying. I don't get any of that anymore. Now all I get is a thought of oh that sounds nice. Or I take a second glance at the wine in the store. But it's not a temptation but a reflection. In that years time I've been sober I went back she graduated college, I worked with my dad on the family business which is tough mentally and physically. My self esteem is back. Not in full. I still have work to do. Things to process and unpack. My relationships have approved. I've ended many others that were not healthy. Even though they were childhood friends.

My point being is that change is hard. No one is going to do this but you. You have to want to change. You have to reach out for help to a safe person. You have to have the desire to fight because no one is going to do it for you. You're giving up one thing so you can have everything. Not the other way around. I cried reading the things that the sad and broken person me wrote. There was one overall connection from those feelings. and that was alcohol and drugs. If you've prayed to get out of something, do everything in your power to get out and never go back. Don't let your hurt inner child make your grown up decisions.

You must live a life in the present. Enjoy and feel the mood that you're feeling. It will pass. If you deflect it will come back even harder and usually at an inappropriate time. Make note of what caused going to drink in the first place. We weren't born alcoholics. We can pin it down to a or many trauma events that we don't know how to cope with and we try to numb and or push it away by changing our current state. That's normal and you're not alone. But we all have to work on that. If you need help. Reach out. Ask for help. I find people are scared to talk to you about the problem that you know and they can see.

You guys can do it. If you want a happier life full of meaning and being fully present. Start doing some reading, start talking to other people, call a substance abuse or suicide hotline. Go to the hospital and ask for help. Whatever level you're on or where you are at, there is help! I think you'll be surprised how many people will understand, and new ones reach out to you.

Some readings I'd recommend: this naked mind by Annie grace. The unexpected joy of being sober by *I'm drawing a blank here* and finally atonic habits by James clear. All have helped and safe my life.

This was a long post. I know. BUT I'm rooting for each and everyone of you. I love you all. You have to be ready to work hard, face your demons and be in the present. I hope that you can all do that in a safe space and manner. I hope you have the will, strength, designer and support group to take the next step in the world.",328

I've had a problem with regular binge drinking for 15 years. Countless black outs. Two DUIs. Countless embarrassments. My memory is shot.

For the majority of the last ten years or so, I've drank almost every single day. I know I've only managed to have maybe 10 to 12 days in the last four years without alcohol - three of those days were when I was in surgery recovery and the other was during a week period after starting probation for my second DUI. I managed to keep drinking daily after that and pass my random sobriety tests with flying colors.. Both of those times I quit, I felt so good and swore to never drink again for a day or two. But it always comes back. 

Today I'm going to try. Really try to start this journey. Again. 

I'm so scared for my health. I had some concerning results from my physical recently that indicate liver problems. I'm terrified to tell my doctor that I'm an alcoholic.

I go days without eating & only sleep an average of 5 hours a night...

My entire family drinks daily. Alcoholism killed my uncle. My boyfriend, who is my best friend and lives with me, is struggling with it too. Lately I've been buying shooters and sneaking them almost every day, back on hard liquor. Drinking anywhere from 6 to 12 beers daily on top of that... I work remotely and I usually start drinking right when I wake up.

I'm so scared of giving up something that's been a huge comfort to me and part of my life for so long. I have no sober friends or family. 

I'm also terrified that I've already gone too far and have given myself cancer or otherwise permanent damage. 

Just here to call myself out I guess, hear some similar stories, successes or failures. Today is my thousandth attempt at day 1 but if I can wake up tomorrow and be one day clean, I'll feel a little better.

Fourteen months straight right now though.

 She wants to live with her dad more and go to hs near him in the city. I live out in the suburbs/country. Last year she wanted to live with me more so I know it's partly just teenage changes. I am more strict than dad. I expect her to do homework oooohhhh I'm a monster. 

The issue is she goes to dad and cries and says how mean I am, which he readily believes because I was mean when we were together. Five years ago. He doesn't believe I'm sober or that I am changing. He doesn't believe that I don't yell at my kid like we used to yell at each other. 


I know I messed up. I know I will never get that time back. I am not fighting her. She can go be there more and hopefully one day all this work will show her how sorry I am. How I regret every single day of drinking. I can't tell her it was partly due to him, partly due to how unhappy I was, partly due to him loving their now stepmom.

Monday was hell had to chug four white claws to feel normal.  I'm sorry if this is a trigger.   I really just feel so low.  I just rejoined because this group really helped me.. I just started seeing this guy and he's a big drinker and we feed off of each other.  I really like him tho and hoping we can be together and I get sober.  My drinking has progressed to a bad area... I never thought I would have to drink at or before work just to curb the anxiety.,5

**Getting an education**

I've been doing the best I've done in the last 15 years or so whilst quitting drinking. Even though I've notched up two failed university courses, and sabotaging myself, I was functional enough to enter a self-taught career.

Now that I'm in my mid-thirties - and leaving my old lifestyle behind me, I lie awake at night thinking about those wasted opportunities - and how I'm getting older and older. I've started to entertain myself to going back to university, and fixing some of those things of my past.  I guess I'm trying to recover a lot of things I missed and should have done when I was younger.

Do you wonderful people have any experience with this?  Will it give me satisfaction? I feel very keen to do it at the moment, even though I know it will be hard. Or should I just concentrate on my current situation and make the best of it.",3

I knew it'd turn into a bottle and an extra glass of wine, even though I'm so ""fantastic"" at not getting to the level of tipsy that the people around can tell I've been drinking. Bah. 
I'd planned on going today instead. It was the second thing I thought about when I woke up this morning. I'd go out and run errands while my son is in school and sneak a big bottle into the house (why sneak?) with the Christmas shopping. Then, I'd have a nice night of one glass after another while I do functional mom things and make dinner. After bed I'd have a few more while numbing out to a show and half-assedly getting classwork done. I'd drink the rest while doing classwork tomorrow when my son is in school again, before sobering up at 1:45 to drive people home from work at 3:30. I'm very meticulous. Then I'd sucker through a night of contemplating buying another bottle, and being grouchy that I won't. What a martyr. 
No hangovers for me, no sir, only the dull ache of guilt that I'm literally pissing away the money and time I barely have these days. 
Hiding all the bottles until I can smuggle them out into the recycling, and doing mental gymnastics to minimize it, or pretending not to feel lonely when I'm the one isolating myself. 

Do average people have to carve out time to drink, or carefully plan it out to avoid making others worry? What about the one time when I'm just too drunk to drive and my brother has to walk from work a town over, or call my grandparents? 

It's been a shitty month with family emergencies, and out of any this would be a slightly justified time to drink the tough away. Is it going to solve it? No. It's just going to turn into another day where I'll live in the meantime instead of doing the one thing that will actually help myself move forward- getting 100% sober, and not avoiding my feelings. And let's face it, I'd just find the next excuse to drink anyway. 

I'm freaking done. I'm short changing this beautiful life. IWNDWYT",14

I thought to myself, ""Wow what a nice day to have a drink!"" I was making every effort to justify why I should have a few drinks... after all, I don't have to go back to work until next week, it's nice out and I'm feeling relaxed!

I sat there on my couch thinking really hard about it, going in to a deep train of thought trying to convince myself a few drinks won't hurt me.

Suddenly I snapped myself out of it! I told myself, ""I need to change my environment right now"" I changed rooms to help change my thought patterns. It worked!

Afterwards I broke down and cried (not something I've done in a long time given the booze abuse has numbed my emotions). I was emotional due to the fact I nearly went and bought alcohol when I am trying my best to give up for as long as I need to (however long that may be..a month? 2 months? 6 months? A year? 6 years? Forever? Who knows...)

I channelled my emotions, put on some headphones and listened to some banging Aussie artists. The music became alive! Something I haven't felt in a long time!

Hey everyone, how are you doing?

I’m struggling a bit with my health at the moment, pretty sure I have pleurisy and it’s bloody painful (feels like a knife in the lung). I’m going to head to the doctors this morning to get it checked out. I’m thankful for doctors.

Aside from my body doing me dirty in the way I mentioned above, today I’m also thankful for something that might be a bit shallow and yet is a huge milestone for me. Yesterday I actually fit into a (UK) size 10 pair of trousers. I have dropped 4 dress sizes, y’all! When I was drinking, I was not only drinking shed loads of calories, but my diet was atrocious as I was too sick to cook proper meals and often ordered take away. I struggled to turn over in bed and get up the stairs. From a logistical point of view, it made life so hard on top of all the other myriad nightmares arising as a result of my drinking. 

So today, I am thankful for my size 10 pants - it’s a tangible result of my own personal recovery.

How are you all doing? What are you feeling thankful for today?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have a husband and son who insist on putting hot sauce on everything.  I’m the cook in the house, and I’m very good at it, but no matter what is served, the inevitable bottle of sriracha or Tabasco or cayenne appears.  I mutter and harumph and insist that they at least taste the food before they smother it.

I now realise the irony of my position.  Alcohol is to experiences, what hot sauce is to food.  It makes it all taste the same.  It numbs you to all subtlety. I now cringe at all the occasions which became mere opportunities to drink.  Every wedding, every birthday, every party, every flight, every Friday, and eventually, every day. 

The speeches, memories, conversations, and details of so much of my life are hazy or lost after 3 decades of drinking, and I have more or less learned to live with that.  I love the vividness of my sober life- I thought that sobriety would have to be endured, but it has turned out to be wonderful.  If I hadn’t gone so low, I don't think I would have ever discovered how extraordinary my very ordinary life is.

I left the bar and walked past some guys smoking a blunt and hit it when they offered, then fell asleep at a table outside a bar while waiting for my bus. Woke up at 10:30pm to 5 missed calls and angry texts from my girlfriend because I was supposed to pick her up so we could hangout.

I finally got on my bus and drunkenly ordered some pizza. I’m broke as hell so I’m regretting it a lot.

I’ve felt terrible today. Depressed, anxious, hopeless. Hating myself right now.",5

Alcohol also lowers inhibitions, we are more likely to do the stupid things.

Living in this kind of endless nonsense makes people think they’re weaker and more stupid than they are.

They are not stupid and weak, but living with alcohol makes it easy to believe so. That changes when they quit drinking and they start to believe in themselves.

I’ve been self sabotaging by drinking after 2 years sober. I’ve realized that besides the creepy alcohol rash, everything sucks more when drinking.  

-Mornings suck ass. When sober I was up at 6:30, drinking my coffee after having brushed my teeth like a normal human as opposed to most times throwing up after Attempting to brush in the morning. 

-Anxiety is back up to a 7. 

-Agoraphobia is tapping my shoulder again. 

-Bed time is not a real thing right now. 

-Confidence is at a supreme low. 

I went almost two years without drinking. I went from extreme panic, anxiety, and agoraphobia to almost none of these symptoms. I gained confidence, self esteem/respect, and most of all hope. I hoped for things that didn’t involve wishing I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. Four days ago I realized I wanted a divorce. I’ve spent those four days in a self sabotage spiral. I know that I will stop drinking again because the “boredom” of sobriety is SO much better than the anxiety and bullshit fuckery of drinking. So, if you’re bored with sobriety, or feel like you’re missing out, believe me, you’re missing nothing. Alcohol is a propagandized drug that will fuck you over every time. Don’t watch commercials or your friends and family with envy that they can drink like a regular person. No one feels good or cool the next day. It’s all bullshit. Alcohol is poison and bullshit.",21

No wisdom to share today or anything else. Just a note that when I quit (as a binge drinker) I was in very, very bad shape and would have died within a month if I kept up what I was doing but it now seems like another world and lifetime. 

I don't go to meetings or think of myself as an alcoholic and I don't crave booze. But my commitment to abstinence is rock-solid. I'm engaged to my perfect woman, have a wonderful child and life and it's so alien to think back. Not bad or emotional anymore, usually. Just very strange to even try to imagine what that bizarre desperation and correlate willingess to obliterate myself *was*.... Like, who the f*ck was I and what the f*ck was I thinking?!

But five years, even more than 4 or 3 is special to me in particular because .... statistically it's the closest thing we have to ""recovered"" --- little detour and requisite shoutout to SMART who taught me it was absolutely OK to believe in full ""recovery"" rather than a lifetime of it --- *after five years without a drink your odds of abusing alcohol in the next year are identical to any randomly selected member of the larger population.* 

I've thought about that idea a lot over the years and here I am today.  

Happy. 

Please quit if you want to do. It's a 100% guarantee that you can do it if you want it enough and are prepared to just give in to whatever help works for you be it AA, Smart, Stamp Collecting, Scientology. It is 100% yours if you want it and needless to say, IWNDWYT.

If I was drinking, I most likely would have poured a glass of wine while packing. That would have led to a second, then probably a third, and maybe a fourth because like I said, it’s been a stressful and crazy time in my life. I would have passed out in bed, drunk, rewatching shitty tv. I would have woken up tomorrow hungover, 10 x more stressed, and been in a bad mood travelling down to Bahamas with my family. 
Instead I ordered Thai food, did my packing while drinking water, and now I’m unwinding before bed with a bath. I’m going to have an amazing sleep and wake up tomorrow EXCITED!

I thought the whole situation- being in a big theatre for the first time since covid (covid is done, right? /s), booze flowing every where to grease the audience's sense of humor, etc, would be much more triggering than it was. Happy to report that none of it really triggered much of anything for me.

That comedian was in rehab about a year ago, was using for about a year before that while doing various big time comedian things, and was in recovery for I believe 15 or so years before that. While in hindsight it seems obvious, I did not anticipate that 90% of his 2-hour long set was going to be about relapsing into drug and alcohol abuse, his star-studded intervention, his time in rehab and how he is putting things back together. I didn't know what to expect really, I have been a fan for a long time and his material of late hasn't been about those kinds of topics. It was an interesting experience to hear the jokes and stories, and laugh (and laugh a lot, it was hilarious) at them, and it was pleasantly de-stigmatizing for those 2 hours.

Obviously humor can be touchy, and I think context and personality matter most about whether or not that can be a useful tool to come to terms with ones experience. Would love to hear other peoples thoughts though, if shared gracefully and respectfully, given the delicate nature of the topic.

2021-11-17 21:59:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qwfzch/quit_for_the_holidays/,Quit for the holidays,"I started writing and publishing a blog about my experience  through sobriety.  I thought that this week's post may help those of you who are on this sub and considering quitting but are waiting until after the holidays.  I hope some of you find it helpful.

\---------------

Timing for quitting alcohol is never perfect.  My birthday is coming up.  I’m taking a trip in a few weeks.  Our anniversary dinner is next month.  Year-round, pending events give us excuses to postpone taking a break from alcohol.

“I’ll quit after that” is a common phrase.  Eventually, the event comes, and we drink.  Afterwards, we regret our drinking and again desire a break from alcohol.  We decide we are going to quit, but now there’s another event looming on the calendar making the timing again just not right.  So we say, “I’ll quit after that.”

This was a cycle that delayed my sobriety for years – and I’m not exaggerating.

No time of year is this cycle more evident than the holiday season.  Thanksgiving quickly turns into Christmas followed by New Year’s Eve.  For these six-weeks, event after event fills our social calendars – with alcohol as a prominent guest at every one of them.  How could we not partake?  How could we muster the resolve to attend these get-togethers without imbibing?

Call me crazy, but I propose that the holiday season is the best time to take a break from alcohol for a few reasons.

First – you can fully enjoy the holidays.  

In my drinking days, I attended numerous work and social holiday parties with a plan to drink a moderate amount of alcohol.  But, of course, I often went overboard, and a cycle of shame would begin.  I’d be angry and embarrassed for just enough time to start feeling better by the next party.  I’d repeat the process of overindulging all over again.  Stress and anxiety would rule what should be the merriest time of year.  

But in sobriety, I am fully present in these moments of celebration.  I’m not wondering how much I can drink or how strong I can make my next cocktail.  Gatherings with friends and family are spent with my focus on appreciating being together.  Seeing my children come downstairs on Christmas morning without the haze and hangover from alcohol brings a happy tear to my eyes.  Hanging out with extended family around the fireplace, catching up on the year behind and looking forward to the year ahead – those moments that I thought I was enhancing with alcohol are now enriched by being fully present through sobriety.

Next – your resolve is strongest in the beginning.  

As with all new efforts, your commitment to abstaining from alcohol is highest in the beginning and taking on this challenge can be energizing and exciting.  

A lot like starting a workout routine or a diet, we are most focused and committed in the early days and weeks of the effort.  Your resolve for quitting will be strongest at this time and you can start appreciating the moments of the holidays without the physical hangovers and emotional angst.

Finally – it’s a great time to observe.

If you’re like me during my drinking days, you rarely watch other drunk people while you are sober.  Seeing someone progress from sober to drunk is a learning experience.  As you watch this, recognize that you make the same progression when you drink.  Witnessing the actions of others while they drink can help to solidify and strengthen your own decision to stay sober.  It is important that these observations are not made in the vein of judging others.  That is unkind and also not particularly productive or helpful.  But look at it as research.  Getting a sober view of the impact that alcohol has on someone’s behavior, speech, and decision making from a new perspective can be, well – sobering.

So, if you are thinking of delaying your break from alcohol until after the holidays – I’d suggest you reconsider that and get a head start.  Do it now!

I know what you might be thinking – “I can’t believe Paul is telling me to quit drinking during the hardest time of the year.”   And I get it, quitting during the holidays is extra challenging because it presents the most social opportunities to drink.  But that’s the bonus reason to do it.  When you prove to yourself that you can control alcohol during the holiday season, you build your confidence for maintaining that control throughout other times of the year as well.

I’m convinced that “right now” is always the best time to stop drinking – so don’t wait until after the holidays. ",5

I joined this sub over a year ago with the intention of sobriety, but as you can probably gather, that has not happened. 

I know I need to stop. I know its unhealthy. I know it will kill me. This is actually the 2nd doctor that has told me this. I'm a 28 year old guy that drinks his problems away. It's the only time I feel happy. It's the only escape I get from depression, anxiety, stress...all that. I've tried counseling multiple times to manage those things, but nothing seems to beat what drinking does for me. I struggle to stay sober, because it doesn't take much for me to turn to drinking. I've heard all the ""cures"" on how to beat this and be sober, but nothing has worked for me. My options are do something about this or die a horrible, painful, early death. I know this and yet it is still so hard for me to control. The only thing I haven't tried is an alcohol rehab program which at this point I am open to. 

I can't keep doing this to myself and I know I need this to be my number one priority from this day on. It just sucks, honestly. I wish it was something I could control or enjoy on a much smaller scale, but I know, at this point, that that is not possible.

If you guys have any sort of tips, tricks, advice, personal experience that you'd like to share, I'm all ears. And if this post doesn't fit the sub, I get it and you can delete it mods.",60

I still miss alcohol though for how it helped. Yes, it destroyed more than it helped, but it did help at first and I can't ever forget that.

It would be nice to not climb myself out of a hole over and over again. 

Was dating someone who was also sober. He had 8 months and I had 9 months. We went to Miami in June and shit hit the fan. I regret being talked into it. 

But hey, when someone has a boat and you’re spending your summer on the lake and being gallivanted around town to the nicest places, the red flags look orange. 

He became emotionally abusive, and I became angry and didn’t hold back my verbal onslaught and the fights got worse. I’ll take ownership of my part — I’m not an angel when I drink. 

He accused me of cheating on him, stealing his watch (never even noticed he wore a Rolex also do not care) — and anything to send me into a tailspin to start drama and the adrenaline rush of fighting. 

Found out after I left that he had 3 DUIs, a pending sexual assault charge, and a secret kid with his ex finances’ best friend. Kid is 1.5 years old. 

Sure, I dodged a bullet in the end. Doesn’t mean the pain isn’t there. Sober him was great. Sober me was great. 

When I was sober I could handle my emotions. When I drank I became my emotions. 

I look and feel like shit, I gained 25lbs, and went into a very, very deep depression I’m still climbing out of. 

Was sober for two weeks, had my last drink Monday night after getting blacked out on Sunday and sleeping with someone I don’t know their name or really what they look like. 

Posting here with my tail between my legs. 

Miss y’all. 

Learned a lot about myself and I stopped isolating. I barely left the house when I was sober and didn’t realize how disconnected from the world I was. From myself. 

Now with this new information I’m heading back to therapy and good news is my favorite yoga instructor moved back so I have some sense of comfort. 

All I know is sobriety isn’t always easy but it is always worth it. 

I LOVE SOBER ME. I loved dating sober it was awkward — even our first kiss when he awkwardly hit my glasses and I felt like a teenager again. Those are the moments I loved. 

Remembering. Being present. Accepting all the awkwardness. It was so beautiful. I only want to date sober now. I could have NEVER said that before. 


Solid field research. Happy to be back here.",151

Another day hungover. But glad I didn’t blackout last night. I am really scared about my heavy drinking this month. My heart feels weak and I feel so tired. I wake up multiple times in the night.

I’m tired of being sloppy. I feel like I can’t turn to my friends because they don’t understand. They say I don’t have a “problem” and I’m just young. But I really feel like drinking is consuming my life.

I think that I drink to cover up anxiety. It gives me a good feeling for a while. But why do I keep drinking for that sliver of a good feeling if I feel like shit the rest of the day??? I don’t know what to do. I don’t know who to turn to. Here I am.",10

I am 22 years old and I probably have problem with drinking. I never believe that someone can be alcoholic so early. But maybe it is possible.. I started to drink when I was 16 or 17 years old. I was always the one who was drinking the most at party. Always blacked out. But in that time I was drinking only 2 times per week. So I was more heavy drinker than alcoholic. After some years I started to drink more and more often. And if I look at last 6 months I think I hit my bottom. During the 6 months I was drinking every night and day. Minimum 10 drinks, maximum was 25. I was drinking at work cause I needed the drink so much and I couldn't wait until 10pm. When barman served me no more (after 20 drinks and some broken glasses) I was literally begging him to give me one (according to him).
In last 6 months I blacked out almost every night. 
In last 6 months I spent more money than my salary is per month so I had to borrow money from friend.
In last 6 months I heard from a lot of friends and colleagues that I should stop drinking.

Now I am sober for 14 days.

I don't know if I am really alcoholic. If I am not I was on good way to become one. But I know for sure that if I will take only one drink I will take more and more until I black out. I just decided I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to think all day about drink...and even now I am still thinking about drinking and kinda miss the feeling of being drunk I know for sure it's not worth it. And I hope my soberness will last forever.

Is here more people with similar problem? What's your story?",10

Ever since I was a young boy I just loved babies and grew up to be a camp counselor, kids were just in my wheelhouse.  I couldn't wait. 

But my drinking was brutal. I was always the messiest, sloppiest, saddest. I was always the problem at the party. Good hearted but caused chaos. And pain.

Five years ago I became a father to the most beautiful baby girl. My dream had arrived.  I figured that now my purpose is here and it's my time to shine, my drinking will fall in line too because I know that nothing means more to me than this. I was wrong. My addiction didn't care that I had my beautiful daughter. And my bursting happiness also didn't translate to healthier drinking habits.  I still stayed out all night, many nights not even coming home even tho my beautiful wife and daughter were waiting for me. It's hard for me to admit that but it's true.

Two years ago I was lucky enough to welcome my second daughter. A few months after that my drinking destroyed my career that I relied on to support these two girls. Six months ago I got a divorce.  My wife and I never treated each other great and the fiasco I kicked up that lost me my career was too much. We couldn't live through any more.

She lives two blocks away and I am sober. I lost fifty pounds. Me and my ex are treating each other better than we ever have. And I'm now the father I was meant to be. I will be packed full of wisdom to help my girls. And I love them so much.

It's beyond painful for me to know that them being born didn't snap me out of it. But today I forgive myself and if you're reading this and have a similar story, you should too. There's a common tale amongst men and fathers ""oh yeah I drank a lot but cut it all out when the kids came along"" and I think this narrative 1. Gives a false impression that addiction just ends when your life improves or has a new purpose and 2. Brings shame to good fathers who struggle with addiction.

I'm the father I was meant to be now because I am sober. And now and what comes next is all that matters.",118

I'm not proud of it, part of the reason is cause I knew there'd be no consequences i.e. homelessness as the owner needs money and hasn't evicted 2 other people that were literally high on meth for a month straight. I'm just here because I'm too broke to leave. I'm working as an Amazon delivery driver right now but I might get fired because they score your driving and I forgot to wear my seatbelt for an hour 2 days ago and lost 50 points. Whatever, I'll get another job. It's tough work walking 2 miles and leaving an hour early to get to a job that has me doing 10+ miles in a 6-10 hour shift with no breaks and then walking home. That and I don't have the best roommates, one girl here, the only other person who has been to college has paranoid delusions and flipped out on me because I was ""making weird sounds"" as she walked by (I wasn't) and it's annoying as fucking hell cohabitating with psychos. 

But really the only reason I want to drink is cause I'm bored, it's my day off, and I want some dopamine. Don't get me wrong I gotta do laundry, nothing's stopping me from doing 50 pushups, there's plenty other activities or ambitions I could pursue. It's so ironic because I'm an oxymoronic health nut. I take 10 different supplements and eat really healthy and am probably in the best shape of a decade because of how physical my job is. I walked / jog 75 miles last week, over 50 this week, many deliveries requiring me to haul a 50+lb. box up 3 flights of stairs. And still I'm so dissatisfied with my life, but all the exercise and being mostly sober the past couple months has definitely alleviated my depression somewhat. Anyway thanks for reading. I'm just lost, so lost... I've lost direction in life. All I really want now at nearly age 32 is a lot of money and a girlfriend but those seem unattainable so my brain jumps to the quickest method of dopamine delivery which is vodka.

But I’m just not sure anymore.,"Hi Friends, I was on day five alcohol free last week, bit relapsed again. There are enviromental factors, or medicinal factors, or just my self indulgence.

On Thrusday I started binging again. I was also taking zoloft. I’ve mixed in the past so I didn’t think it’s a big deal. My wife didn’t know that I’ve been drinking. I continued the drinking daily.

On Sunday, I felt manic euphoria for the  first time in 10 years. Hence I felt it so acutely. My wife noticed too.

On Monday I crashed. Nauseated. Unable to eat. Tuesday got worse. I couldn’t slow my mind. I felt tingly in my arm muscles. I kept drinking “to soothe my nerves”. 

On Wednesday I reached out to my
doctor, so said that it’s because I’ve been mixing zoloft with alcohol. And told me to go to the hospital asap. My wife drove me there. The hospital staff gave me fluid drips and diazopham to calm my nerves. They disagreed with the first diagnosis, saying that it’s probably acute anxiety.

While there, they let slip to my wife that I’ve been drinking again.

My wife was supportive throughout the day and night. Told me I did the right thing. But also said that she was disappointed and hurt that I had relapsed _and not tell her about it._

Im so grateful that I live in a place where there’s so many support system for people like me (who now I feel is just fucked up beyond all reason). My wife, her family, my doctors, my therapist, my psychiatrist. I just feel like I’m a drain to them.

Thank you for listening.

I've been doing some thinking and I can't really seem to put a finger on anyone direct issue as to why my drinking has become a problem. I know I have an impulsive an addictive personality which can certainly contribute. But I often think where and when did it start. For me at least it started off with smoking weed and that eventually became a daily habit of mine due to the wrong influences and people are hung out with. I am entirely sure where I got hooked on alcohol though other than it being super accessible.

I think maybe for me it is used to cope with my perspective of being a failure in my own mind and not reaching my goals. I also have a lot of trauma in my early years in life and have quite a few skeletons in my closet I have never fully dealt with, partially due to concern of my own safety if they were to come to light.

Recently and in the past year or two I have found my reasons for drinking or literally non-existent and yet I still do it. There'd be no reason other than boredom or literally if I like a habitual practice for me. I'm just very curious as to everyone else here what got you started and what and your opinion made it into a habit.

I have been able to quit smoking cigarettes about 78 years ago which I'm very proud of and was difficult. I used a book by Allen Carr which essentially helps me transform my perspective on being a smoker versus nonsmoker. I have quit my daily weed usage as well for about 4 months now. Alcohol to seems to be the only thing that I truly struggle with and I think it's due to the ease of access, even though a cigarettes are very accessible for me as well even though I was able to quit that so I'm not sure yet.

But, something did happen. A lot happened actually. My body went to war, and it lost. 

Things I experienced: going from sweating in bed to freezing, laying in bed wishing I could sleep but not, feelings of dread and disgust, an emotional rollercoaster/mindfuck I can't control, ridiculously bad morning breathe, not doing my night time routine, having a pounding headache on a gorgeous day, throwing the day away, eating shitty food the next day with no self control, missing out on a fun sober night with my fiancé, wishing so badly that I could go back and not have drank 

And, honestly, so much more. 

I had three beers. THREE BEERS. I used to drink three beers no problem, no effects, no hangover. When I was drinking regularly my body was in survival mode, it was at war and blocked out the effects so that I could persevere. But, my healthy body - it wants no part. It wasn't ready for its reunion with the poison it thought it rid. 

And so, I start over. Reset my counter. Drinking those three beers, it wasn't worth it, trust me. I'm so ready to feel better again. I'm more educated now. I learned from this. My sobriety is a journey, and this was part of it. If you've been romanticizing your next drink, read this again. It won't be romantic at all. It's not worth it. 

Sobriety isn't boring. You're not missing out on anything. You're opening doors to a better life for yourself, one day at a time.

This will be a doozy though.  I'm nervous.  I've had those stupid dreams the past night or so that I drank and wake up feeling all panicked..... so I know my sub-conscious is semi-shitting itself.

Argh!!!  I needed to post this for accountability.  My initial ""goal""  was a month, and now it's a year.  I SO want to make that post on here about reaching an entire freaking YEAR.  It seemed so unachievable at first but is now actually a reality.

""And now I tell you openly

You have my heart, so don't hurt me

You're what I couldn't find

A totally amazing mind

So understanding and so kind

You're everything to me""


Wow, now THAT is a love letter!!!
But for maybe the older crowd, It's also ""Dreams"", a song from the Cranberries. (I love that song)
To the more connoisseur however, they know it was written by a fellow alcoholic and also what happened to her, ... she drowned in her bathtub.


In love, in the prime of her life, with millions of dollars and the admiration of everyone, … dead, overnight, by alcohol and prescription drugs( the autopsy said she took the therapeutic amount, but mixed with alcohol, it proved fatal.) When they found her, she had an empty bottle of champagne next to the tub that she drank alone.


I too should have died in the same way.
I went many times in the bathtub while drunk and waiting for my Benadryl to kick in so that I could go to bed.

In fact I was drinking so much, that I had alcohol induced high blood pressure, that and the ungodly amount of Benadryl would mess with my heart and I would wake up in the middle of the night with my chest pounding.

Then came 2020, the whole work from home thing, people would tell me I chose quite the year to stop drinking. Mind you.

I used to be a functional alcoholic, I would never be drunk at work, but … working from home, I know me, I would have been drunk 24/7.


So there it is, I should be dead 3 times over, either by :
1. drowned in my bathtub,
2. middle of the night heart attack or
3. dead by liver failure due the 24/7 drinking.


But here I am, so I implore all of you to stop drinking or if you are reading this for a family member who has a drinking problem, show them this, alcohol will eventually kill you/them!

…………………..

How did I stop drinking, it’s gonna sound stupid, but I told the truth to my doctor when she ask how much I drank.
Little did I know, doctors are trained to look for the cause of the drinking, so in came a barrage of questions, and she determined that the stress from my work was not helping at all.


She then placed me on a paid time off thing, that she extended every month, for 4 months.
I figured this was it, I was never going to have another chance like that ever again, I had tried to stop for years but this was my real shot at it.


Also, the shame?!!? yes, I was ashamed to be a on paid time off depression doctor’s note thingny, so to me I had to have something to show when I came back, to proved it was all not in laziness.


So shame, of all things, kept me from drinking again.


I became opened about my alcoholism with my friends and co-workers.
And you should too, it’s what got me to stop, I can’t imagine telling any one of them I drink again.



Anyways, that’s my 2 years, I have lived more in those 2 years then in the previous 10.
I encourage you all to stop, I believe in you all, you can do it!

I'm lucky enough to have seasons tickets to the Toronto Maple Leafs (well my husband bought them, but I go a bunch!). The games are electric and I love going. But another thing here that goes hand in hand with hockey? Booze. The last time I went to a hockey game with my husband a few weeks ago, I didn't want to drink. I was trying to string together a few sober days and just couldn't. That night I went into the hockey game saying to myself, I'm just going to order a hot chocolate and have a merry old hockey night in Canada. Well, we got there and, no hot chocolate! I had no idea and was honestly quite stunned - why on earth do they not sell hot chocolate at hockey games. In fact, the only alcohol-free beverages they had was water or soda - and I also hate soda. So I ended up with a vodka soda (I like soda water haha that's it), followed by two glasses of wine, followed by a totally shitty sleep and feeling like garbage the next day. 

Fast forward to last night - it was my 9th day sober. I went to the hockey games with my sister and sister-in-law. I arrived on time and ended up watching the first period alone - sister and sister-in-law were late because they were finishing up their pre-game drinking and eating. Come the first period and we all go out to stretch our legs, they ordered more drinks and I stuck to water - and I didn't even mind! It was such a good game (against the Nashville Predators, we won, lots of fights, a crazy last goal) and I didn't care that I wasn't drinking - I actually enjoyed that I wasn't drinking that cheap hockey arena beer. I enjoyed being totally present and focused on the game. I saw every goal, and I noticed my sister & sister-in-law missing a lot of them because they were tipsy and talking (Nothing against them or drinking! None of them have any issues with drinking and hockey isn't for everyone, the point of last night was a girls night to socialize at a hockey game). Another great feeling was going to be sober, proud of me and my decisions, and waking up this morning. Tired because it was a late night, but hangover free. 

Now I know I can have a better time at a hockey game without drinking. In the same way I know I can have a better time on vacation without drinking. You just have to get through those sober firsts and show yourself you can do it and that the experience is better without alcohol. 

Anyone else accomplish any sober fists recently?

Let’s start with some of the challenges. The diarrhea and upset gut for the first 10 days were absolutely no joke.  I had several moments of extreme anxiety (especially in the first two weeks) where all I wanted to do was chug a beer to calm down, but I got through them.  The more I reflect on it, drinking has always been a time filler / boredom reliever for me so I still find myself wanting a drink in moments when I’m not sure what else to do or feeling restless.  

It’s been easier than I thought to shift my mindset into being a non-drinker.  While I find myself occasionally craving a beer, I have been able to tell myself “I’m not a drinker” and I am able to find peace in that.  The social pressure hasn’t been as bad as I thought it would be (maybe it helps not being in your 20s anymore).  Losing weight has been a piece of cake (down 12 lbs so far).  

Net net, the thing that has been most surprising to me is finally realizing how alcoholism is so normalized our culture.  I didn’t really think I had a problem because I know plenty of people that get drunker than me and I never missed work or anything because of alcohol (and hey I’m financially successful so how bad could I really be?)  But holy shit I was drinking EVERY SINGLE DAY and I didn’t really feel that bad about it because a lot of my friends do too.  

I don’t know if I’ll ever drink again.  If I’m being honest, I probably will.  But at least for now I’m not drinking.  And maybe this experience has allowed me to really take a step back and think critically about alcohol consumption so that if do decide to have a drink someday I can be more mindful about it and do it much less.

When I do not have anything to drink at home, it´s not that bad, but from the moment I got up today all I am thinking about is shopping and oh hell what if I lose it :( Please advise. Thank you all.

&#x200B;

EDIT - I made it to day 4!  It was literally impossible to avoid alcohol because there was booze on sale and there were bottles with rum like next to glutenfree flour (what the heck...), but I DID IT AND I DIDN´T BUY ANYTHING! I got myself a nice coffee and expensive herbal good night tea though. The tea worked wonders, I wanted to reply to you all wonderfull supportive redditors last night, but I fell asleep with my son  :) But I feel fantastic and proud myself.

Once again, thank you all. IWNDWYT! ",8

2021-11-17 04:59:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qvvzea/is_it_possible_to_control_drinking/,Is it possible to control drinking?,"Hi.

Just to make some context, I've been here in the past (under a different alias). I've stopped drinking for six months (although it was maybe four years ago) and I remember it as being one of the best times of my life.

Despite all this, from then to now I've accomplished many stuff, although many of it were very difficult after my mother's death. When I was sixteen I went deep to alcohol, everyday drinking from morning till the next morning. That made me a vegetable, life wise. But after those six months, I've accomplished plenty (while drinking, but more or less moderately). I went back to school, I've got a job, I'm living together with my girlfriend and my anxiety is way better.

In the meantime I've thought several times about those six months, but I don't want to completely stop drinking. Don't ask me why, I just don't want to. I like my poker nights with my whiskey. I like at the end of the day, after work, to go drink one or two beers. I hate to imagine myself at a wedding and not drink anything. All that stuff... And sometimes, only sometimes, I can control it. But, most of the times, as probably many of you know, I can't control it at all.

My girlfriend decides that wants to change job, I can't deal with the emotions (although I'm super proud of her) so I go drinking and she comes to an empty home, after her job, and I'm still drinking, when I should be sober and at home waiting for her, to support her. I have a discussion at work, I get all heated up, so I go drink one or two beers with my father and his friends. ""Suddenly"" I'm not with my father anymore, I'm just drinking with whoever shows up and I'm on my tenth beer and it doesn't stop there. And it's another day that my girlfriend comes home, it's empty, and I get home drunk.

I'm a happy drunk, meaning that I don't come to her and yell or hit her or anything like it. But still, I'm drunk and she's sober (she rarely drinks).

I've read the Big Book, but I can't follow it since it requires to believe in a higher power, which I don't. I lie to myself saying that this isn't serious, but honestly, now on hangover, I know how it goes. It feeds on me and all things around me start falling apart. I've also read that some people just can't stop when they start. It's just biology.

What I want to ask from you, besides your help, is to know if any of you have been in a situation similar to mine and controlled your drinking, or if the only way possible was to stop entirely.

Thank you for reading.",13

I've been on a downward slope for about 5 years now. What started as a ""few drinks"" at the weekend fast became a few drinks every day. I had to hide them from my wife and resorted to all sorts of things, hiding them in bins around the house to recover later that night, getting up in the early hours just to go downstairs and have some spirits. I was booking time off work but not telling my wife so I could just go to the pub then played it off as a few social drinks after work so I could hide it. 
About 6 months ago I was at rock bottom, laid on the floor of my living room crying that I didn't want a drink but I just had to have one...then I came across this group. 
Ever since I have checked in every day being inspired by the stories and comforted to know I'm not alone. So many of the things people were saying felt relatable for the first time. I didn't feel the overwhelming shame that has dominated my life for so long. 
Since then I've been checking in and promising myself I was going to take the leap but not daring. That was until Sunday when I sat down with my wife and came clean about it all. I sat and wrote a pledge that I won't have another drink for one month (12th December). So here I am, day 4. I actually feel worse to be honest, thoughts are cloudy and I'm struggling to focus on anything (writing this is the longest thing I've done since Sunday I think! :)) 
I don't know what the future holds after the 12th at the moment, I hope it'll go into another month but I'm not looking to that yet, for now its day 4 and tomorrow is day 5 and because of you all I don't feel silly saying I'm proud of myself for that. 
So back to the crux of my message. Thank you so much for setting me on this path. Every person who shares their story on here, good or bad is sending a message that might just save someone's life. You're heroes and I owe you so much. 
Much love guys, day 4, here we go!",6

But because of my recklessness and my (to be recognized by me way later) drinking problem, things had changed between us. So instead of talking it out like a normal person I choose to “sneak” shots at the bar during the concert cause I knew they would get me fucked up and I wouldn’t have to sip on a beer and risk her seeing. And I could avoid the awkwardness of the situation. well long story short she did know I was drinking and she left back home and we kinda fell off. after that trip I began my long streak of blackouts mixed with a six month sober streak which ended in another black out concert night with my best friend during which I didn’t even get in the venue cause I was so drunk. I don’t know why I needed to ramble all this but I’m still sober and didn’t even think about actually having a drink, but the thought of how easy it would be to crossed it once or twice. I’m stronger than that tho and I have a lot I have worked for that alcohol will not take away from me again. I am a stronger, better, more caring man sober and I want to keep it that way for myself, my wonderful girlfriend (who has helped show me how good things are sober and that it’s possible) , and all the people I have relations with whether it be at work friends or family.

Anyway, 3rd day not drinking after a pretty bad consumption habit. I am having 2 major issues of which all are of the less than glamorous variety.

The first one is that I have waves of Supreme itchiness especially in my face and head. I do worry this is liver related and will get it checked out when possible. But I was curious if any of you had a similar issue and had any luck with something like benadryl? At my job I absolutely cannot be touching my face. 

The second, is that I am absolutely shitting my guts out. Not only is it extremely loud and oncoming with little warning but it is also more frequent than... it should be. Again, at work this is problematic as I have a high pressure job that does not allow me time away from my battlestation. 

I'm not asking for medical advice. These two issues are causing me a lot of grief particularly at work, I was just wondering how any of you who have been on my boat managed to find some comfort?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning Folks

In reading all the responses to yesterday’s check-in, I noticed quite a few mentions of drinking dreams.  Indeed, some people regard them as nightmares.  I suppose I do too.

When I had my first one, I took it as a sign that I was faltering, close to failing.  It frightened me and shook my confidence.  My recurring drinking dream is not of actual drinking, but instead it’s of waking up with a blackout - my horror is always the blankness and trying to piece together the night before, just like so many miserable mornings I had.

 After one or two more dreams, I stopped feeling so negatively about them.  On SD we often advise each other to play the tape forward and think of the consequences if we are tempted to drink.  A drinking dream is a way of experiencing these consequences without the relapse.  

I like to view my drinking dreams as my subconscious letting me know it’s on my side, just like my conscious self. Every part of my body and soul working towards the same goal- TeamMe !!

Have a great Wednesday, wherever in the world you are!",300

I woke up to a **text** from the guy I was seeing saying things were over and it was the first time I let myself be vulnerable with someone after a rough break up. I got ready for work just bawling my eyes out in a panic because I was already nervous about a morning meeting with my boss's boss. It was so left field, I couldn't wrap my head around it. But I pulled it together and made it to work, only cried a little behind my computer and got through it. If this was a 105 days ago, I would have treated this symptom with Jameson. 

I ended up texting an old friend I hadn't seen in years. Our primary form of communication is exchanging funny shit we see on the internet. I told him I was having a crap day and he said, ""What are you doing tonight? Let's hang. Tonight. Do it!"" If you're going to eat your feelings, might as well do it with friends, so I met up with him and his girlfriend (first time meeting her, super rad human) for pho and we had a great time. She bought me dinner. ""You've had a rough day, don't worry about it."" Then we went to the Russian Gourmet and I bought some frozen pelmenis for a nostalgia trip and we parted ways. Ended the evening with some sci-fi with the best friends and I vented about everything. 

I shouldn't have stayed out so late, I'm going to be tired for work in the morning... but it was worth it. I surrounded myself with good people instead of booze. Yeah I'm sad and heartbroken and all that junk (who tf breaks up with someone via text? first thing in the morning? fkn rude) but I'll live.

So today sucked. But it was also great because tomorrow I'm going to wake up with 106 days of sobriety under my belt.

So what (Carl) Jung thought was that at the beginning of time, people were unconscious and consciousness emerged with all of its catastrophes-- consciousness of death for example. One way out of the burden of consciousness was to return to unconsciousness. You can do that with ALCOHOL, being dependent, you can do that by failing to grow up. You can refuse the burden of consciousness by becoming unconscious again. But, there's another way for it- by becoming even more conscious.

So the idea would be, a little bit of consciousness is like an illness, but if you can expand that consciousness upwards enough, then it starts to become something that is its own cure. And part of what your goal is while you suffer through life is to heighten your consciousness to the point where everything gets integrated enough so that's proper medication for self-consciousness..... so it's more consciousness rather than less.

I would do almost anything to get rid of the anxiety, but the idea of never having a drink again is hard to process.  Here goes nothing....",3

- slept through the night without any acid reflux including none today after meals!

- no congestion or allergy symptoms today

- green on Whoop

- PR on Peloton 

- blood pressure is normally 135/90, today I clocked in at an avg of 127/75 


Incredible what 48 hours can do! 

Keep going!

**EDIT** just to be clear this isn’t medical advice and my drinking levels are not alcoholic levels. Maybe technically abuse, but I was only drinking 3-6 drinks a night never puking, blacking out or anything like that. And those are *true* drinks, not 6 pints of double IPA.",3

I’ve been in risky situations - bars with friends I haven’t seen in a year - a couple of times in the last few weeks. It’s been difficult. The voice that whispers “just one” can be so strong.

Three weeks was never a real goal of mine because I never really expected to last more than a coupledays - self fulfilling prophesy.  And that is really the point!  The attitude I have today is very different than ever before.  This time everything seemed to just 'click.'  I haven't quite found the words to flesh that sentiment out yet, but it is definitely different.

I don't post very often, but I read what's posted regularly.  This community never ceases to amaze me.  Thank you to everyone for the support, the wisdom, and the truth.  This little forum might be one of the most honest and candid discussions on the earth, and I'm grateful to have access to it.

While my attitude has changed dramatically for the better, I am in that odd physical phase where everything is healing and rewiring, so I feel quite off.  My sleep went from exceptionally poor when I was drinking still, to wonderful after I first started to abstain.  But now, I am experiencing some moderate insomnia, along with rather vivid dreams when I do sleep.  I am also a bit frustrated (even though I understand it) that I've actually gained weight.  I'm ready for some little victories in that area soon.  But, the very best physical change has been the total disappearance of the constant and nagging cramping pain in the area of my liver/gall bladder.  I was quite worried I had already done major and/or permanent  damage.  I have yet lots of work to do and goals to achieve for my health and fitness, but I'm feeling better in some way almost everyday.

I kept asking myself why can’t I just have one to numb this horrible feeling inside me about the state of our world and our country (USA).  I talked myself out of it. I poured a LaCroix into a Moscow mule mug and watched a documentary on Amazon about a transgender girl (Always Jane) and it allowed me to get out of my head and live in someone else’s world for a while.  

I had the feeling today like I did back in the early days of the pandemic and racial unrest of last summer where I just drank to make the world go away.  I wanted that feeling again.  It was pretty frightening.  I’m proud of myself for letting the feeling pass.  I just have to learn to get thru those hard days, hours, and moments.

My nights used to consist of the same old crap - scrambling to put the kids to bed so I could drink my wine while half watching a TV show, half perusing the internet for irrelevant stuff, half texting people about whatever. If one of said kids had trouble falling asleep, I’d begrudgingly go to their room, get annoyed about the fact that I was in their room, and would try to get them back to sleep as quickly as possible so I could go back to doing half assed stuff until sometime that was way too late. Guaranteed tiredness the next day, all from doing purposeless stuff and staying up until midnight for no reason.

Looking back on all of those half assed nights, I’m a bit regretful bc of the fact that I didn’t discover how good a purely sober night of chill can be. And the quality sleep that follows (well, usually) - it is just…chef’s kiss. It is all euphoric to me. 

Anyway, hope you’re having a great morning/afternoon/night. Iwndwyt!",34

Still struggling with sleep a lot, and almost called in sick to work today. Woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep, crashed out again around 7am and slept til about 10, when I woke up with a terrible headache. Luckily nobody noticed I wasn't there thanks to the working from home arrangement, if I'd needed to go into the office, the day definitely would have been a write off.

Still, I'm proud of myself for the overall achievement. Even though it's only day 10 of the current stretch, I've definitely cut down a lot since doing Dry July, and have managed to make it to work every single day since then. Might not be feeling great, but I'm getting things done.

I have a very neutral attitude about almost everything (besides misogyny or sexism). It’s a refreshing change from caring so much and internalizing and stressing everything. It’s so amazing to be part of the population that can let things roll off one’s back.

As you can see i don't have many days. I've been struggling lately. And I have a lot of stressful events coming up next week on top of my show. I've also only played a show sober once and it sucked but maybe that was for other reasons.

So basically I figured being this early on in sobriety through  these events would be miserable - I've been  planning on drinking through next week to help just get through it, and then stop. I know I know, I actually mean it though. I don't want to be this way anymore. And part of me does believe everything about next week will be more difficult if I stay sober through it. And I do believe I will be ready to quit after, for good.

Another part of me thinks, what's the point of these early days sober though if I just drink anyway next week? And then that part tries to convince me to just start drinking today since I'm going to anyway. But I just feel so much better sober. So now I'm not even sure I should be planning to drink even though I'm almost certain I will.

Anyway I'm feeling kind of weak but I also kind of want to power through this shit. I just have no idea how and it almost seems like a bad idea. I have no idea how I would not drink at the show, at a bar, with everyone drinking, this early on. I did it before after a longer period of time built up sober but this feels too soon.",15

His addiction is to pain killers and heroin.  His slow downward spiral back into addiction began when we started talking and it took him a long time to admit he had fallen back into addiction.  Lying to me constantly and me giving him chance after chance because I felt guilty after his best friend told him I’d be the reason he would relapse.  I gave him one last chance hoping this would be it and gave him a ride to rehab.  Shortly after it he told me the only reason he was even staying was because of me and I tried to remind him that he has to do this for himself and no one else.  Things became rockier and rockier while he was at the first and second stage of rehab and he openly admitted he had seen someone “cute” in the meetings in rehab but that she had a boyfriend.  It really was a shot right to the heart and things started to get worse with weird text messages that didn’t seem to really be meant for me.  One in particular where he told me he was taking a nap and 15 minutes later I received another saying he was in his way to a store on a street I live nowhere near and he texted that he’d probably see me there.  I felt heartbroken because it was either another woman or drug related.  I confronted him and he didn’t answer for 45 minutes and panic set in.  Things just kept getting worse and so I’ve cut communication with him telling him I’m done.  Now I’m constantly getting phone calls with voicemails asking me to pick up because I’m screwing up his sobriety, when really it’s mine own I need to worry about.  I feel scared and guilty and I’m scared he’s going to die.  The last voicemail I got tonight sounded like he was high.  I feel so guilty.  Could someone please tell me what to do.

It’s not specifically meant to be about drinking but it helps me put cravings in perspective and I wanted to pass it along in case anyone needs it today. 

“We often make choices based on immediate outcomes. What can I do to experience a little joy in the next 30 minutes? What can I accomplish in the next hour?

But if you always expect to get a little bit of reward for a little bit of effort, then you often overlook actions that lead to greater payoffs down the road. The relationship between input and output is rarely linear.

The course of action that could provide greater happiness, meaning, or satisfaction in the long run may not make you happy in the next 30 minutes.”

Monday I had to lie to my business partner about why I couldn't work. I felt like such a complete piece of shit. I mean, I still do.

Today was better. I didn't feel a 2nd day of hangover today. But I still just feel gross. What the hell?

I've done this ""take a break"" stuff a couple times with alcohol. And I've tried moderation. But neither a temporary break or moderation ever works. I need to quit for real.

I always have excuses, just like everyone else. My main thing is being single, and dating. Like, how am I gonna go on dates or get laid without drinking? I know it's possible, I'm just lazy. Probably sounds pathetic but I just want to put everything out there.

Something very therapeutic about throwing thoughts in the void 

Just clocked out of work. Ran to the bathroom to run a hot bath. I'm sitting here dying for a drink, which I of course have available to me. Spent my day barely, and I mean barely scraping by. I work in IT, and if my mind isn't sharp I can't do my job. Thankfully I'm good enough at it that I can compensate for a hangover. It's a little bit harder when you're still slightly drunk from the night before. 

""Thankfully,"" as if it's a good thing. I'm customer facing as well, so it's not like I get to go in my little IT closet and fiddle with servers like I'd prefer. No I have to speak to people, communicate with, I'm sorry, but some of the dumbest people I've ever met. Spending 20 minutes to get someone to press the start button or open task manager. It's infuriating when I'm sober, when I'm hungover I spend my whole day biting my tongue. Anyways, it's annoying. 

I live in a mess of a room, play video games pretty much all day, and sit in the dark. Not that there's anything wrong with that lifestyle inherently, imo it's better than watching TV all day, but couple it with working from home and a drinking habit, and you've got a recipe for disaster. Trust me. 

I've managed to somehow isolate myself down to one person outside of work that I speak to, who is actually a very good influence. Someone I've been friends with for God knows how long, well before I started drinking. It does concern me though how much my social circle has shrunk due to the drinking mostly. No one wants to be around a guy who's piss drunk all the time. It's unpredictable and annoying I imagine. 

Pair all of this with the fact that I can't look myself in the mirror, haven't shaved in weeks, and literally count minutes of sobriety after work as a success. Hell the only reason I'm not currently drinking is I'm typing something on this subreddit. It's all just.. concerning. I mean I'm of sound mind now, but surely it has and will continue to take it's toll. When do I go too far? When does my physical and mental health press beyond repair. To some degree it probably already has. 

Why dig the hole deeper then? If it's already bad why make it worse? That's the million dollar question isn't it? I don't know and that scares me. I'm scared to be alone. I'm scared of the world, people, and everything about them. I'm scared of this addiction and ultimately I'm just scared of everything. 

Diary's of a drunk am I right? Makes me wish what the homeless drunk on the side of the road would say if they had a phone, a moment of sobriety, and a reddit account. When did they just give up and let it go that far? Am I on that path? Seems like it.",13

The only thing that saves me is martial arts, but I've been neglecting that because I'd rather have the quick fix than face the arduous task of getting through a tough class. I fear that I'll never stop... 

A fitting analogy is someone who thinks that acquiring more and more material goods will make them happy... If I just get that, I'll be happy. For me it's like, if it ever gets that bad, then I'll stop. But my own mother, who I love dearly, isn't reason enough for me to stop. It totally transcends rational thinking - and this revelation is nothing new to those on this sub... but I cannot divorce from the thought that I will die one day in a random hotel room because I couldn't stop drinking.",9

My sister’s ex husband (M40) just died of liver failure from alcohol abuse last weekend leaving behind their 9 yo daughter (my neice). As you can imagine, the situation is devastating and pretty incomprehensible to a child that age. 

Over the years while he and my sister were still married, the 3 of us had lived together multiple times and were very close. I was a full blown alcoholic too at the time and he and I shared too many bottles and crazy nights to count. Every night really. Eventually my sister left him to his addiction and he and I lost contact. We were living the same life drowning in booze though and I always felt so ashamed through their divorce because I knew I was on the exact same path as this man who was ripping the family apart. 

A little less than 2 years ago I (M33) finally got sober after alcohol single handedly destroyed my life as I knew it in a few unrelated ways. At the time I was diagnosed with fatty liver too but have since recovered very well health wise thankfully. This tragedy has been a huge reality check for me though and I can’t stop thinking about how lucky I am that I escaped before falling to the same fate. I just as easily could have. 

All in all, my neice will now live her life without her father. His family will live their lives without a son, brother, etc. And I’ll live my life thanking God for the courage to stay sober again today. There’s always time to change later, until there’s not.",33

Last week went on a bender the likes of which I haven't seen in some time. I dont drink every day, but when I do, I can't stop, and I use drugs. Anyways returned to work last Friday and I just had absolutely nothing left. No motivation, no sadness, just... nothing. Depression, I guess. I knew that this was a rock bottom. Maybe not THE rock bottom. But it was the bottom of something. 

That's it for me. I never want to feel like that again. I'm tired of this addiction robbing me of my ambition, my creativity, and my hobbies. Tired of replacing motivation with whiskey. It doesn't reciprocate. Whisky and cocaine, they just take. 

Working in the restaurant industry is hard when you're an addict. Being around it all the time, and everyone around you always having a good time, but I'm not going to blame my proximity to alcohol anymore. I can do what I do without doing THAT. 

Anyways, I'm shooting for a week, then a month, then the moon. And today is just another day. Another day that I will not drink.

Not drinking is now easy. I am buying non alcoholic beers and enjoying several fewer NA beer than the number of heavy beers I would have drank. When I started, I was sure I couldn’t live without alcohol in my life and today I feel as if I could be alcohol free if I wanted to.

It doesn't help that I have depression, so I feel apathetic most of the time. But I usually end up drinking when I'm home for the night and have nothing going on.

Tonight will be an easy night not to drink because I'll get home around 930ish, still need to make dinner and shower and stuff. So for whatever reason, that tells my brain that drinking is off the table. It's too busy a day and It'll be too late to start.

If I don't drink, I just end up lying around and watching TV all night after I get home from the gym. Then, ironically, I feel bad that I didn't do anything. As if drinking and gaming, or whatever, is better.

It's also not for lack of hobbies or things to do. Theoretically I love movies, games, reading, LEGO, writing, and arguing on Reddit. But it feels like alcohol is like firing up my dopamine receptors.

On a good week, I might fight off drinking for 4-5 days. But I always cave somewhere in there. It's really ramped up the last few months though, and it feels like a losing battle. I work out almost every day and I've still gained probably 20-25lbs this year. Got the whole skinny fat thing going on.

How does everyone find motivation? It's brutal that I need motivation to do the things I find fun. I guess I could just start going to bed early as hell. I want to WANT to stop drinking, but ultimately it's just like, fuck it. It feels like the only way to enjoy things.

I should add that I get that the depression is causing the apathy. I've tried a handful of antidepressants in the past and nothing worked. It became kinda disheartening, and finding doctors is a nightmare. Not sure what my insurance covers exactly, etc. So that's a whole other thing. Wild that, in the moment, alcohol seems to work as an antidepressant. I just feel like garbage, mentally and physically, the next day.",55

Couple years ago a temporary sponsor told me to pray in the morning and again at night. I am an atheist, or at the very least a strong agnostic. But I started praying again, even though I dont know who I am praying to. It doesn't hurt me to fake it, so I do it. 

And I find that at night I am expressing gratitude not just for not drinking, but for the littlest things that were good that happened in the day. I'm asking for strength to get through the challenges. I'm sending good thoughts to people I know, even acquaintances, who are going through a hard time. 

And somehow, this gratitude at waking each day sober and going to bed sober makes my commitment to sobriety stronger. 

I just wanted to share that with you guys, because I have never felt any form of contentment before. I'm not suggesting by any means that anyone here start praying. I just wanted to express that this ""faux prayer"" helped to center my emotions around gratitude, which in turn is helping me maintain my sobriety (something I've attempted a million times before, but never felt contented with the way I do now).

However, I just want to rant to people who may understand where I am coming from. I've just begun my sober journey, and am excited about how my life will change without alcohol. However, this journey has opened my eyes to a few things about our society. 

I recently watched the Netflix adaption of Locke and Key, which I enjoyed a lot. Yet, I couldn't help by notice their blatant portrayal of casual high school drinking. Several episodes depict 16/17 yo children drinking with zero negative consequences. They do a subplot of the Mom being sober for about six years and then relapsing, but finding the strength to not drink again. Like that covers their asses for showing a 17 yo killing a bottle. What's worse is they toned down the violence, horror themes in order to appeal to a younger audience. 

 This got me thinking about how drinking is constantly portrayed in media of all types. From the time that we are kids, we are shown alcoholics as strong and independent. From the spy who swills martinis, yet still is able to drive, shoot, and handle conflict. To the woman report who goes home and kills a bottle of wine while digging through case files. The examples are endless. 

 I don't know why society holds alcoholism in such high regard, except that maybe it's a way of manipulating the masses into the hustle, grind, drink, repeat cycle. Work hard; play hard! The culture in the military which turned me into an alcoholic. As if it makes up for a poor work, life balance. Yeah you're grinding 16 hr a day six days a week. Killing a bottle on Saturday night makes up for it all, I guess. 

Any thoughts? Anyone else as annoyed by this as me?",109

Then I fucking vomited again.

Three times in less than an hour.

Now I'm just shaking and crying and spitting on my bathroom floor because my mouth keeps filling with saliva and I can't handle sitting up and I'm just here.. wondering if I'm going to die, wondering if I should call an ambulance, wondering why I ALWAYS end up back in this place.

I've done this before, I've been hospitalized before, and all they did was just make me comfortable with the detox. But people are dying right now, the hospitals in my state are overloaded. I keep DOING THIS TO MYSELF. I don't fucking deserve a bed, or to be comfortable, and if I deserve to live I guess that's between me and the gods.

I've tried all the things before. Naltrexone, rehab (in-patient and out-patient), AA, family interventions, therapy, anti-anxiety medication, specialized trauma therapy, fucking CT scans and MRIs to see if I have a tumor because they ran out of ideas.

None of it worked, apparently.

I feel like some people are just fucked and we never know why but it's just horrible that I have to know that I can't ever fix it and I still try to find some fucking shred of will to live.

I haven't been this low in a long time.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for the support and the follow-ups. Knowing there was a stranger out there worried about me really helped me keep it together. Cheers! And I look forward to participating around here in ways that I can give back.

However, the biggest problem I had were Monday nights. I work Monday nights, and had been having a drink before going to calm my nerves and deal with stress. Over the years that 1 became 2 to as much as 4. So I wouldn't drive drunk, I'd have 1 before leaving, and 1 in the parking lot after arriving, then 1 on the breaks. I was never drunk, but buzzed. About a year ago I crossed a dangerous milestone, where I would sometimes drink WHILE driving to work (if I didn't have time to have the 1 in the lot after arrival). That was when it hit me that I had a real drinking problem, but I STILL did it on occasion. Well last night I had zero drinks before, during or after work! I had started doing short meditation and mindfulness and it got me though it quite easily. I'm hopeful and optimistic I can keep this up. I actually was less stressed last night than when I did drink, as I was often stressed that people would figure out that I was at work. (I should mention that I don't work in an industry where being buzzed can result in any harm to anyone.)",6

The thing that gave me the most motivation and validation was when I told my father. He looked at me, put his hand on my shoulder and just said ""I'm proud of you"". I started to cry hard when that happened. Being told ""I think it's awesome that you are able to recognize that for yourself, and want to make changes, I'm proud of you maritimerintraining""

My dad now has cancer. I haven’t been able to hold a job for more than a few months. I finally found an amazing company (I’m in tech sales) and work from home. They have been incredibly supportive and have given me lots of time off. Problem is I started drinking more and more and taking days off bc my dad was in the hospital and such but he wasn’t in the hospital at that time. I really abused their trust.

We had it sorted out and I was set to go to AZ for a work even when HR called last night and said she was made aware of a recording (when we do sales calls we have an auto-Corder). Well I left it on for 2 hours, got drunk and yelling and freaking out. She said I am not terminated right now (twice) but that she needs to connect with the Exec team to figure out the best thing to do and how to help me. I was asked not to come to AZ and I am on temporary unpaid leave. She said she will not tell my Coworkers why as it’s not their business. Problem also is at the end of the call I apparently admit to my mom I lied about my dad and got a couple days off so I could feel better.

I love this job. I am writing up an email to the team with an apology and somewhat of an explanation. I’ve also already called an IOP I had been speaking to and my managers knows I was considering doing that before this happened.

They are not aware of the PTSD/depression etc. I was thinking of texting her privately, she said I could and then sending a more general email to her and whoever she decides to share this with. My permanence at my job has been outstanding for 4 months but has dwindled the last 2. 

Do you guys think they’ll fire me? I won’t find out until next week. Does anyone have experience with this? Does it sound like a good plan? I was to get better but I want and need my job too.

If anyone knows anywhere else I can post for advice (especially HR) I would appreciate it.

Thanks ❤️


Ok UPDATE: thank you so much for all the responses. I definitely would have sent a groveling smoosh email to hr admitting fault and begging for my job. Instead how do you all feel about this?

I couldn’t even calm down when I got home and I even almost had a friend come stay with me.

Why? Because I drank so much my stomach was in pain and it caused me to think I was dying. And that boosted me into a dissociative state of panic. I literally didn’t want to be alone as I pushed through night 1.

I've felt almost nothing outside some fogginess and some cravings. I am taking Ativan 2 to 3 times a day at a low dose (1 to 2mg).

Is this normal, should I still expect it to get worse?

Edit: I'm exaggerating a bit here, I've been cold and sweaty and my pulse did spike for a few hours... But I just haven't had the hallucinations, confusion, and disphoria at all.

Do more severe symptoms sometimes appear suddenly?

Is there a time when most people are considered ""out of the woods"" with regard to the deadlier side effects?",2

Last night, I had one of those for the first time (ever, I think).

My dad, my brother, my other brother - ""What are you doing?! Don't drink!"" 

That dream tells me just how dug in I am on stopping. If I'm feeling guilt when I'm passed out, whoa mama, that guilt would be 10x worse if I actually did it.

**SOBER,** on the other hand is kinda meh.  Sobering thoughts, and the like.  Not so much glam there.  SO, I prefer to embrace sobriety.

A form of inspiration, (and to occupy my mind for an hour) was to come up with words that each letter of the word sobriety represent to me through this journey. 

Start

Oneness

Better

Real

Identity

Empathy

Trust

Yippee-Ki-Yay!

Ok, that last one might technically be more than one word, depending on who you ask.  But, it's so damn fun to say, especially at the end of the thought process!

It started with severe corrisol rushes and panic attacks at night and slowly just turned into waking up multiple times a night feeling restless and tingly. Over time sleep got better and better. I learned what worked for me — sleep hygiene and exercise to tire me out, sleeping on the back instead of the side, sleepytime tea, correct room temp. For 70 nights I would sleep for some hours, wake up many times a night, and then finally wake up around 5:30. 

Tonight was the first night where I slept fully for 7 and a half hours and woke up at 6:30 naturally without agitation or internal jitters. Sleep is slowly returning and it’s the most exciting thing for me in the whole journey. Every time I sleep through the night is a victory for me.

I know people will say ""if you're asking if you have an issue, you have an issue.""

Some back story. I come from a family of power drinkers. My father and mother both from as long back as I recall. My one brother also was a heavy drinker until he figured out his life and now is just a social setting drinker. He won't talk about his change in life.

Personally, it was beer/beers after work for decades. Then as the kids grew up and started being able to adult themselves (they are fully functional teenagers that don't drink, smoke or do any illegal drugs) I switched up to mix drinks after work, usually puttering around the house. My wife usually one or two glasses of wine. The last year or so I'm am straight up whiskey/bourbon/brandy on the rocks. 

I'm self employed, work is fine, more money than I should make. Some days I wake up with a bit of a headache but nothing more. Everyone around me drinks way more than I do in social settings but I'm just wondering if all my issues in life are building up to more and more.

Some other details, my doc diagnosed me with dangerously high hypertension. It can't be classified as pulmonary yet. Meds are working to keep the blood pressure down. Fatigue is a major issue I have had also.

I just can't not sit down after a 10 hour day and not have bunch of drinks when I sit to PC game in the evening. 

Thanks, just wanted to get that off my chest this morning. I have no one to talk to about it. If I did, all hell would break loose if the person holding it together for everyone in multiple families lost their shit.",3

I’m an out gay guy who is very social by nature and have a group of friends who I love but don’t help these habits.

It half makes me want to give up and half makes me want to make immediate major change. I feel like both options seem impossible… I don’t know what to do. 

My addictions have been draining to say the least. I’ve acted like an idiot and lost friends and spent way more money than I had and feel just lost in general.  It was my boyfriend’s birthday this last weekend and he had friends in town. I partied too hard per usual and the weekend ended with me having hurt one of his friends’ feelings and trying to do major damage control afterward. I’m embarrassed and really feeling pathetic. This was kind of my last straw with myself… something has got to give. I have no clue where to start so I made this account and hoped to get some advice from this sub.

2021-11-16 02:07:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qv21kn/over_two_weeks/,(Over) Two Weeks!,"I started writing this when I reached my two-week mark, but wan't able to finish. However, I've made it two more days still going strong. It's probably in the top three longest times I've gone without drinking, but this one is feeling like much more of a lasting thing this time.

Mostly, I just wanted to thank everyone in this community for the mindset that's gotten me this far. When I'd tried going about this alone, it was usually along the lines of trying to quit for a set amount of time so that I could prove I could, so that I could eventually give myself permission to drink again. Or I'd be so hung up on thinking about not drinking that I'd be *constantly* thinking about it to a degree beyond even the worst of when I would drink.

The most helpful things I've found in this sub haven't been the glorious bi-centential sober celebrations or worst rock-bottom stories (although I don't want to diminish from the achievement or empathy of those). But at least for me (and in hope of encouraging more of it), it's the day-to-day posts, comments and replies about the small hardships and small victories. I've been finding relatable individual posts or comments, then clicking those profiles to see what the overall arcs of your processes have been. In seeing both ups and downs, it makes it so much more relatable. And with so much positive but realistic vibes in helping both the good and bad we're all going through, it's sort of permeated into my brain as sort of this subconscious offline support-system.

In that spirit, I hope to be able to share some personal up's, down's, epiphanies and overall ramblings I've found in this short time here so far. Most of which, I'm sure may be old news to some of you veterans, but will hopefully have some value to others later to come:

* My insides feel better. I'd been experiencing discomfort in my middle back right, which after some doctor's visits were luckily not progressed liver issues, but most likely on their way to becoming issues. That experience was my first real acceptance that I was dealing with more than just trying to maintain a short-term balance of drinking vs. hangovers. It's been several days since I've felt anything, and I'll be doing some follow-up visits in a few months to hopefully see some progress.
* I've realized one of the biggest sources of my over-drinking was avoidance of the comedown right after. Even after only a drink or two, I really didn't like that sleepy/cranky/awkward transition back into whatever was after. Since I've cut back, I feel like I've got more independent time slots in my day to work with. But it's a double-edged sword, since boredom is probably one of my biggest sources of drinking in the first place. I've been pretty good with filling it with new hobbies, but there's still a lot I think I need to do to make it sustainable.
* Those vacuum-whatever bottles for keeping things hot are awesome for keeping tea excessively hot for an excessively long time. My tea wasn't doing shit for my oral fixation if it was getting cold in 5 minutes. Now I can have something last long enough for a functional distraction.

Anyways, good luck to you all, and thanks for turning into totally-not-weird-but-definitely-constructive voices in my head :) Look forward to hearing more of your journeys.",7

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning SD Friends

Have you ever watched a group of young children playing, in a park or a school yard, and pitied them for being sober?  Have you ever thought to yourself, what those kids really need right now is a crate of beer and maybe some vodka – they’ll have so much more fun if they’re all wasted?  No?  I didn’t think so.

But I think most of us will admit to thinking just that about ourselves and our own lives, before we quit.  Can I have fun if I’m not drinking?  And will other people accept the non-drinking me?  The results for me have been mixed.  Yes, absolutely, I have just as much fun and joy in my life as I ever had.  I have taken up tennis, which I find fantastic for sober socialising.  Do I love nights out where everyone else is a drunken mess? Not so much – overly drunk people are tedious in the extreme, so I always exit stage left by 11pm at the latest.  I have discovered that most people, thankfully, don’t drink nearly as much as I did in my heyday.

Am I dull without a drink in my hand??  Absolutely not!  I’m the courageous one, expressing myself clearly, feeling every feel, not the anaesthetised one dulled in a fuzzy cocoon of sameness.  There is no experience to be had, if drinking is the experience.  I think fearing that I’d be perceived as dull, wanting to fit in, sabotaged my earlier quit attempts.  Sobriety is bringing me happiness and satisfaction that never existed in a bottle of booze.  Dull, my ass!

2021-11-16 00:32:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qv0jkc/broken_things/,Broken Things,"Hi everyone!

So, one of the absolutely unexpected twists that has happened on my journey with sobriety is that, somewhere along the way I got into Christian rock. My sixteen year old self is more horrified at this than you could possibly know. I worked as a Sandwich Artist at the Subway in the mall food court and I had a coworker who would monopolize the boom box in back. Unfortunately he only owned like three CDs, one of which was the Pulp Fiction soundtrack, another was a Frank Sinatra compilation, and the other one was the Christian rock band the Newsboys*, which I loathed with a passion and complained about loudly. It inspired a deep dislike of Christian rock in me. (Life has had a way of making me swallow my words along the way, this isn't the first time and I doubt that it will be the last.)

Anyway, don't get me wrong, I'm still nowhere near being a Christian. But I do find that a lot of the messages in Christian rock songs align with where my head's at in recovery. And the song that's my jam right now is [Broken Things](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WdUu6ZsdVfM) by Matthew West.

I'm coming back from a relapse, and I was lost in the weeds for quite a while before I finally ended up relapsing. I've been through some shit this past year, some of it self-inflicted, some of it just... getting stuck in the mire and muck of life. And I hunkered down in it and threw away three years of sobriety with a middle finger salute. My inner teenager was strong, and I let the angst flow through me.

And I have struggled coming back. Not so much with staying sober, one of the things that I learned by relapsing this time around is that alcohol *really* doesn't work for me anymore. But this time around it's not like it was when I got sober before. There's no pink cloud, my sky's been heavy and gray. I haven't felt good about being sober again. I've been dragging my feet about doing the things that I know work to help me get and stay sober, and I'm not excited about my recovery. Or life in general. I haven't been moving towards a life in sobriety, I've just been moving away from a life that doesn't work for me anymore. I've been bedraggled and I've felt lost. Drinking doesn't work for me anymore, but sobriety hasn't seemed all that great either.

But the magic of Christian rock has awakened me. Listening to this song tonight reminded me of what I actually want out of life and what helped me find meaning and value in sobriety before. I want to be someone who does what I can to help support other people in their sober journey. That's the beauty of sobriety for me, that's where I've found joy in my sobriety before. When I die I want people to say, ""She helped a lot of people get sober."" I've heard other people describe sober people who have passed away like that, and that's the legacy that I want for myself. I don't want to make it my job, I want to do it for fun and for free, because it has value and meaning for me.

The other thing that this song has reminded me of is that going through shit just makes me more useful. I'm able to help people when I understand the pain that they're going through because I've been through similar shit myself. Going through some shit just makes me more useful and increases the number of people who I can help.

I want to have a full life in recovery too, this isn't the only thing that I want for myself. But this is what gives meaning to the struggles that I've had in my life and adds value to the wasted time. I wasted a lot of time through my drinking, I didn't do things that I might have done to connect with other people and bring positive value to the world. And I've done my share of fucking up and made my share of mistakes. By being active in service to other people in recovery I have the opportunity to turn all that around and transform it and use for the benefit of myself and others.

I dunno, it's just extremely helpful for me to remember that all of that still holds true. Even after my relapse. My relapse and all of the crap that led up to it just gives me more experience. And I finally feel invigorated about my recovery. I'm more useful now, and I understand a whole lot more about what I need to do in my sobriety in order to stay sober. It sucks going through life sometimes, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. There's beauty and value in everything, well, once you get through to the other side of it, anyway. The me of a couple months ago would have sneered super hard at that, but I'm older and wiser now.

Sending hugs, sobernauts. Thanks for sticking with me on my journey.

I do individual therapy once a month and talk to friends but I feel like my friends don't really understand my struggle. I don't expect them to because I know they're not addicts like me. 

I'm finally at the point where I'm in over my head. I created a nightmare of dating drama, I feel overwhelmed by all the waves I've caused for myself emotionally. I feel out of control of my emotions and I truly don't understand anything right now. 

I worry if I keep going on this path, I'm going to eventually lose it and start drinking again. So I'm gonna go to my first AA meeting tomorrow. I'm scared but also I've been doing a lot of things outside my comfort zone lately so I feel ready!

2021-11-16 00:07:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qv04ii/35_of_sobrietysome_thoughts/,3.5 of sobriety...some thoughts,"I never really understood the concept of journaling, or why people do it. Then I thought back to my posts on here outlining my alcohol issues and then seeing my progress updates. It finally clicked - in a way, this is what journaling could be for me. To look back and see how far I've come.

I'm settling in more and more to being sober. I went out with some girlfriends yesterday and didn't feel the need to drink. I was just thinking how shitty they were probably going to feel in the morning and have to go to work. They wont even realize they feel bad either, its such a normal thing. I was asked how long I was going to keep not drinking. I said I didn't know because ""forever"" is a long time, but I'm not drinking today.

I do wonder how long I'll stay sober. I feel great, I plan my days around working out and different events. I'm in-between jobs at the moment (which is a whole other issue) so I'm interviewing a lot but I also love getting up early and going to pilates, then a HIIT or cycle class later. I feel more confident and attractive than I've ever been, and at 33 I could kick my 22 year old ass in the gym. I never thought I'd be in such good shape. I'm a better mom to my daughter an we've taken so many fun weekend trips together, sans alcohol for me and it was wonderful to experience these things with her.

Alcohol would have killed me, and I don't think physically. My headspace was so off that I had suicide and self harm ideation a lot and I know one day it would have happened. I felt useless and that nobody really cared for me. I remind myself of that everyday and I'm so proud of where I am now, and I can't wait to see what the future has in store. 

Waking up refreshed and not hungover is amazing. To everyone struggling out there, it will get better. And you can do it - dig into your why. Find support groups, try new things. It will get better.

I think journaling would be very helpful to me, so I think I'll start doing that. And check in with this awesome group every few weeks as well - even though I read your posts daily : )

I feel pretty safe as I do self defence and I’ve got a protection trained dog. I do sex work and I see a lot of issues ranging from anger issues to built up trauma in clients. My first drink was at 18, I didn’t even drink on my first *night out* because I saw how drunk my friends were and how blind they were to pervy men. Only been on 3 nights out and none of them I got drunk nor could get loose to. 

I’m currently in an Airbnb in a rougher side of the city I’m in. Today, Tuesday 3am I was just playing with my dog and a woman came stumbling across this open courtyard area. When she got closer I saw she had no shoes on, her feet were swollen and she was in a dreamy like mindset and after a lighter. I don’t smoke at all however I did make sure she sat down. She started insisting she was fine before I said anything, saying how she’d be find as she just wanted a lighter so she could smoke. I asked her where she was headed and she told me to her friends. The “*my friend lives around the corner I’ll be fineee*”. I told her great let’s walk that way as I didn’t really believe her and she didn’t have a phone on her to call someone. After a long time I persuaded her to let me walk her to the door of her *friends* at the least. She started telling me her life story and that she was fine she grew up here still being care free. The she started panicking the closer we got as she didn’t want to be seen getting walked to her friends. I told her it was be fine and that I’d watch from a distance to see her walk in. In the exact time I had stopped to watch her walk a taxi pulled up and a random man got out and was walking her way, the hugged and he went in a door opposite to where she was headed and she turned around to run in. I don’t really know if she’s safe nor if that was a real friend of hers. 

It’s difficult when drunk people don’t see the dangers they can be in and how vulnerable they are. I struggle seeing some of my customers because of how they are and the stuff they offload to me. I don’t see how it can be an addiction nor how someone actually wants to be that drunk to get away, it just doesn’t help at all.

I’m scared of what it means for him, what happened to cause his relapse, or why he was in such a dark place. I care about him a lot, and just hope he can pull through.",15

It got so bad this year that he was fired from his job two months ago. I have been trying to help him to quit drinking and it has been very hard. He goes back to alcohol when the withdrawal symptoms become unbearable. He has no insurance and no income/saving, which means he can’t afford to go to a doctor or a rehab. I can help him financially, but only to a certain extent. He also does not like to talk to anyone about his drinking problem, except to me. I think I may be able to convince him to go to AA, but I also wonder if he needs medical help. He has constant headache and he can barely eat anything. I am wondering if there are any options for him to turn to for help or if there are ways to quit without going to rehab. As far as I can tell, his life is not in danger at the moment, but I am very worried and want to find ways to help him get better soon.

In ADHD circles, I've heard it called hyperfixation. I get into a new hobby and I get VERY into it. For example, recently I went for a big (25 mile) walk and I started thinking about how I could walk ALL of the time and wouldn't it be great to walk 10 miles every single day? What if I walked the Appalachian Trail? What if I walked across the state? I start looking up blogs and videos and subreddits for walking. Like other hyper fixations, the walking thrill lasted for a while, I made some good changes and then the thrill faded and it turned back into regular old walking.

Sobriety was like that for me too. When I first started, the thrill of finding something new sustained me. I was a *sober person* now. I was reading this subreddit and I was watching sober YouTube. I was reading every book I could find about addiction and alcoholism. There's a thrill in new things and sobriety can be a *new* thing. This initial thrill is important and it is useful, but I know better than to depend on it to sustain me. I know myself well enough to know that eventually, sobriety will just be boring. My brain won't fire feel-good chemicals when I think of how many days in a row I've been sober. I need another type of gratification other than thrill seeking to keep me going.

I KNOW I can't drink. I know it is not something I can do without obsessing over it.

What keeps me sober?

I've found that love is what can sustain me. I love my family so much that I can't subject them to the drinking version of me. I love my lifestyle and the new friends I've made through my new, active hobbies. I love being someone that others can count on. I love myself enough to believe I deserve better.

You've been moving much too fast/
You never know just where it ends/

/My Northern star, where do I go
/Yeah, without you?

2021-11-15 20:48:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/quwbfa/six_short_months/,Six Short Months,"Hello everyone.  I've lurked in this sub for a few years now but finally I have a story worth telling.

Drinking as a teenager was totally normal in my life not unlike a lot of you but when I turned 21 it took off and I followed in the footsteps of my family by becoming a boozer all night and every weekend.  I moved downtown next to a bar and spent every night closing the place out even though I had work at 7am.  Cocaine helped with that problem.  Eventually I got married and had a baby but the drinking continued.  Now I was still home every night to be a present family man.  Yes I was drunk but only a handful of times did I drink so much that I was noticeably sloppy. I changed diapers and everything else that is expected as a father.  I wasn't out at the bar once my daughter was born.  One day however she gave me an ultimatum.  At this point I was drinking a liter of 100 proof liquor a day. It's her or the booze.

I entered 28 day inpatient rehab but I never would have gone if it wasn't for her.  Rehab was awesome and I had a blast.  The 4 weeks went by quickly and it was a wonderful experience I hope I'll never forget but now the real test starts.  Going back out there in the real world where there are liquor stores everywhere and you realize we live in a society controlled by alcohol.  There are ads and places to buy alcohol everywhere you look.  It's almost like the government wants.... well never mind you get what I'm saying lol.  I've got friends that work in those liquor stores.  I've been in their homes and vehicles.  How will I stay away?  

Well turns out I love being sober!  I lost 50 pounds in 7 weeks just from this lifestyle change.  I started eating healthier and cut out all fast food just because it didn't sound appealing any more.  I can exercise now, without my heart feeling like it's going to explode.  I've been to parties and get-togethers where alcohol is in charge and it has not been a problem for me to stay sober at all.  All of my friends and family are proud of me except for one person.  My wife.

She blindsided me with custody and divorce papers.  She also got a temporary order of protection so I can't see my 2 year old daughter.  Our marriage is far from perfect and we are definitely not right for each other but she is attempting to rip my life apart.  She wants half or all of everything I own and full custody and child support.  I've been a loving father and I try hard to be the best husband I can be.  She was spreading rumors about me to neighbors, wives of friends and members of my church.  People I've known for 20+ years.  I hardly recognize this woman any more.

Luckily I have a great support group of friends and family and I'm a very laid back person so I'm not going to act out but fuck me if this isn't the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with.  I'm going to continue to work on myself by eating healthy, exercising and staying sober. I'll have been sober six months on Wednesday.  I'm proud of myself and I think that's all that really matters.

I told her after a particular bad public night, that I would stop if not slow way down on my drinking because I'd never trade her for alcohol. I did very good for a few months. But now I am back to drinking every night (not getting drunk. Just one or two drinks). She asks me every now and then if I have been drinking. Sometimes I tell her about a night but I don't tell her about it being every night. It used to be the only thing that would help me sleep, but now it doesn't because I'm up crying for the guilt of lying to her, I want to quit and I know why I drink (don't ask because I won't tell.). But I just can't stop, I feel like I need it and even though I hate it even now I feel like I'm having a panic attack because I haven't had a drink.

-I struggled with severe depression since I was 13. 

-Ive had 2 suicide attempts, one of them being way too drunk. 

-I was court ordered 2 AA meetings a week. 

-Went for 9 months before something clicked for me.

I've been a lurker here for months. Previously I did it as a way to find ideas on what to do instead of drinking. I've been a nomad/loner for a while (in 3 years multiple countries, countless cities; no lease) and frequenting bars with pool tables is a way I pass the time. During the day I am alone in my domicile working remotely and by night a couple times a week I want to get out and be around others. My whole life I've been an extrovert and being out in nightlife or going to the gym at night always seems to recharge my zest for life. I'm in my late 30's now and now find myself in a weird situation: my body won't let me drink.

How is that exactly? In my late 20's I was drinking liquor to save on calories. I've been fitness-minded for a while and thought I could avoid gaining weight if I sipped on vodka or tequila straight. Well I drank a few nights a week, maybe 1 or 2 glasses, and eventually my stomach began to experience bouts of extreme pain and soon I was informed by a doc that I was developing fatty liver.

I cut back, changed my approach, even took 75 days off altogether to check myself to see if I could. I did and it wasn't too challenging other than the lack of socializing – I was already developing into a loner given circumstances that I have since addressed with self-care and counseling.

I've lived without a lease for 3+ years and I generally move at least once a month. When I get to a new place I find all the pool tables and begin making acquaintances with the personalities I find. Last April I switched to IPAs, rarely accompanied by whiskey shots anymore. I decided in early September to stop by my Uncle's house which acts as a homebase. I receive mail, save some cash, and get fed really well.

My uncle is really into eating meat, in every form, and drinking every day. Starting at 4:30 he and his partner start drinking and don't stop until it's bedtime. Everyday they drink and eat rich foods. In my early years I used to drink with them but recently I've been a little turned off due to my observations their lifestyle has on their bodies in their old age.

One night after a particularly stressful day of work, after a few other nights within the week of having a hazy IPA here and there and copious amounts of meat every night, I made myself a strong drink: 90% Jameson, 5% cinnamon whisky, 5% baileys. This is a drink I've made before at their house because they always have the ingredients even though they gasp in disgust when they witness me combining them. I enjoyed it slowly and made another...before the very end of the night I made a third. That night of 3 drinks was the straw that broke the camel's back, folks.

The next morning I woke to my first gout attack. It's been over a month and a half since that night and I still cannot drink anything...not even spiked seltzer. I waited until it went away completely...tried last week—2 spiked seltzers and nothing else—next day: gout.

I can't even have BBQ because it's triggered in a few hours.

When I told my Uncle he was in disbelief. In his eyes I seldomly drink! How could his nephew have gout? When a podiatrist confirmed it he said, ""Well, you are your mother's son.""

And suddenly **everything** clicked. *Of course*, I thought. *Why didn't I think of this before?*

My mother, never a drinker, has spent the majority of her life ailing from serious kidney disease — she has only one working kidney from a transplant. My body has been trying to tell me for years to stop drinking and I never put it together. First it was frequent insomnia, then long-term memory loss, then sharp stomach pains, then fatty liver, and now this– the most debilitating of them all.

I'm going to bring this up next time I see a doctor but I am certain due to my age and/or genetics from my mother, my kidneys can't process purines like it used to. It's time to accept in order to live without pain I am going to have to forfeit alcohol and eat healthy nearly all of the time.

While I was bummed about this revelation at first I, the optimist, decided to flip it around: I am going to save so much f\*ckin' money and I'm going to become totally fit from now on because I won't waste money and calories on expensive poisons.

Thank you all for sharing your stories, thank you for letting me share mine.

ps. If you have any tips on normalizing nightlife without drinking alcohol please leave a line. If you have comments about this request leave it as well, I'd like to hear your thoughts on whether this balance is achievable or recommended.

The message I keep hearing is that we need to change our beliefs about alcohol and drinking, and that sobriety is the biggest gift we can give ourselves. ( Think Annie Grace and especially Veronica Valli and her 'sober secret'.) Secondly, I've also internalized the message that alcohol is a poison and is really, really bad for our health in ways that we don't talk about enough. 

This, plus the absolute shit state I got my body into just before I stopped drinking has left me with some kind of disgust whenever I think of alcohol now. Like I think about red wine and I gag a little. Or when I'm at a bar all I can think of is damn, I never, ever want to put any of that shit in my body ever again. I'm pretty happy with this, and I was amused when my partner wanted to know if I was going to drink a few days ago because it was a 'special' occasion. My first thought was, wow, normals really think that we are white knuckling through life and literally chaining ourselves to furniture to stop ourselves from drinking, lol. 

Anyway, my question is, has anyone managed to stop long term through really working on their mind set  à la annie grace and the soberlit way, or is this the 'pink cloud'?  I'd like to hear about your experiences",9

It’s my 8th day sober. I can’t believe I actually went through a whole vacation without drinking. 
There were times it was really hard. Mornings were always great but there was usually a couple hours in the evening right before dinner where a quiet battle would rage in my head about whether to drink or not. There were also periods where I felt incredibly insecure - like by not drinking myself, I was ruining my husbands experience as well. I asked him if he cared that I wasn’t drinking, of course he said no, but honestly he’s much too nice to tell me the truth if it did bother him a bit. I got in my head at times, thinking I was boring, feeling bad for my poor husband drinking alone, feeling bad for myself.  
But you know what? Those few moments of anxiety, insecurity, and struggle pale in comparison to how amazing I felt the majority of the trip. We had a great time, we did so many cool things, ate delicious food, and I was present for all of it. In general I was in a much better mood because alcohol actually puts me into really bad moods and makes me short tempered. I was more positive and happy. And now I’m heading home from vacation feeling amazing! We won’t be getting home until probably midnight but that won’t be such a big deal because I have been sleeping great and will sleep great again tonight. I’m so proud of myself. IWNDWYT",23

2021-11-15 17:13:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qurxn3/just_a_few_words_and_some_things_to_expect_for/,Just a few words and some things to expect for those new to sobriety,"Hey guys! So since I hit my 7 years alcohol free this year, I was thinking about some of the experiences I’ve had and things I’ve learned along the way and thought maybe I’d pop in and share here in case it helps someone who might be new to sobriety. Mind you these are simply my personal experiences and thoughts, so sorry and no worries if they don’t resonate. 

Firstly, it’s normal to feel whatever it is you are feeling. Whether it’s anxiety, fear, frustration, sadness, irritation, sorrow, embarrassment, anger, fatigue, uncertainty, misery, or straight up lost, please know that your feelings are valid and part of YOUR process.

It’s going to be shitty and hard and uncomfortable. You know this. Mentally prepare for it. You’re gonna get cravings and feel withdrawal symptoms but you gotta fight through it. I learned this method through a mentor of mine when trying to control my intense sugar cravings after I got sober, but believe it can apply to booze as well.  Sit in your discomfort, literally. When you find yourself craving a drink or reaching for a bottle, sit down. It’s important to pause and to start to be in tune with your body. Close your eyes and do a body scan. Analyze the craving and discomfort you’re feeling. Whether it’s tightness in your chest, discomfort in your gut, tingling in your skin and bones, whatever, just take a second to sit there and process it. Ask yourself what is so uncomfortable or bad about it? Take some breaths. Ride it out. It’s just a sensation and it will pass. Stay strong. And also, have a plan when these feelings arise. You need to replace a habit with another habit. Herbal tea became my best friend. Take a hot bubble bath. Do 10 jumping jacks. Go for a walk around the block while listening to your favourite music or podcast or audiobook. Read some “Quit Lit” like Annie Grace’s This Naked Mind. Eat something enjoyable. Anything but alcohol. 

Reframing your inner dialogue is important. What do I mean? What we tell ourselves is so very powerful. A big one for me was simply changing “I need a drink” to “I want a drink”. By saying you need a drink, you’re giving control to the alcohol. Fuck that! You’re stronger than your craving, stop giving alcohol the power over your life. And don’t tell yourself you “can’t drink”. Tell yourself you’re CHOOSING not to drink. 

Don’t compare your journey to anyone else’s and don’t judge other’s for their choices. We are all here for the same reason, but our struggles, experiences and paths are all different. I remember drinking non alcoholic beer when I first quit, but I know some people frown upon that. It helped me get to where I am and I don’t see why anyone should take issue with that. I also chose to go at sobriety alone, meaning no AA, or counselling or support groups. I was hopeful and confident that I’d be able to do it, and turns out I was right. However, I wish I had discovered groups like this in the early stages of my recovery as they are EXTREMELY helpful. Please don’t go at it alone if you have any doubt whatsoever that you won’t succeed. Support is so crucial. I always thought it would be considered weak if I sought outside help, when in fact it’s the opposite and takes so much fucking strength and courage to ask for help. I wish I had sought help before I ended up in the hospital, but that wasn’t my path. Do whatever feels right for you. This is YOUR journey. And if you’re reading about other peoples’ successes, remember things may not happen for you in the same timeframe it did for them. So don’t get discouraged if someone’s bloat went down before your’s or if someone isn’t craving booze or sugar anymore but you still are, or whatever. Be patient. Things will happen for you too, I promise. 

You more than likely will lose some friends along the way. Whether it be because they aren’t supportive or merely because your interests simply don’t align with theirs anymore, be prepared for it. This part actually terrified me but I’m here to tell you, it’s going to be ok. Because the people who remain in your life are the one’s that truly matter. And don’t expect anyone to understand what you’re going through unless they too are going through what you’re going through. Try not to be upset if/when people aren’t praising all your hard work all the time because it’s not going to be at the forefront of anyone’s mind but your own. But always remember, you’re doing this for YOU. And you will feel alone at times, even when you’re surrounded by people. It can feel sad and frustrating, especially in the beginning. But it gets easier. And you will start to find yourself being totally ok with leaving the party or event early to be in bed by 9pm. And nothing beats waking up feeling fresh without a hangover and actually be productive in the mornings.

I saw someone mention somewhere once that they found sobriety more enjoyable and easier when they started thinking like a kid again, and it’s very true. Eat all the candy and sugary cereals guilt free. Play more. Play video games, board games, go to arcades. Read books, learn, discover new topics and pastimes and hobbies. Run through sprinklers, eat ice cream in bed while watching a flick, smile more, explore nature. Do things that make you happy. 


Look, the party isn’t over. It’s just different. But it’s different in such a wonderful way, you just have to give it time. You’ll see. There are no negatives to a life without alcohol, or at least non with merit or that matter in the grand scheme of things. But the positives are endless. I mean it. Give yourself the life you deserve. Become one of the people you envy. Don’t think of how far you have to go. Focus on not drinking just for this day/hour/minute. And most importantly, be kind and patient with yourself along the way. What you’re doing is so damn hard and I’m so fucking proud of you. You WILL do this. All the best everyone✌️",308

So, today, I’m starting my journey again. I’m tired of blacking out every weekend. I’m tired of not knowing what an ass I’ve made myself. And I’m tired of the shame spirals that steal all my energy.

 I had NOT been drinking though) and I ran into the curb- HARD. I was so shaken I couldn't think what to do, so I called AAA. The guy showed up and very kindly put my spare on for me (I was embarrassed because I suppose I could have done it myself) and happened to mention that he had given up drinking (not sure if he thought I was drunk, or just making conversation, but I'll never forget it). Fast forward to today, just under two years sober myself, I was driving- not drinking OR texting- I took my eyes off the road for a second to adjust the stuff in my passenger seat and I hit the curb even harder than last time. Well, this time I knew what to do. I pulled off the road, and got my spare tire on but Oh My God, the shame! Honestly, the shame felt just like when I had been drinking and knew I had acted like an idiot but couldn't remember. I couldn't stop thinking about the AAA guy who changed my tire. I keep remembering all the times I DID drive drunk and can't believe I made it home ok.
Sorry if this post doesn't make much sense. My nerves are quite shaken and I'm worried about the possible repair bill, but I wanted to say that I am here, I am present, and I Will Not Drink With You Today.",5

Worst hangover of my entire life, because it was really 3 crammed into one. Had a nurse come give me an IV bag I was so bad. Barely helped. 

I’m at a precipice. A tipping point. I can either fix this, salvage my relationships, keep it up at work, and move forward. Or I can keep drinking and watch everything I love crumble around me. 

My face has been so swollen you can barely see my blood shot eyes. 

It’s time to move forward. I’ve finally seen enough, slipped too far, suffered too intensely. I deserve so much more.

For many years, drinking was my coping mechanism mixed in with dating and relationship drama. I'm trying to sort out how to untie the two because while I wouldn't like to drink again, I do want to date again.

I actually told myself that I wasn't dating. And then I met someone who liked me but didn't want a relationship, which caused a whole whirlwind of drama both in reality and mentally. I never go too ""off the deep end"" but usually send lots of texts with my feelings and make out with the wrong people. And then go on a bunch of dates with men who forget about the man who doesn't want me. And that causes more drama, and....you see the cycle, no?

It feels very similar to drinking for me. It distracts me, makes me anxious, I fixate on it and obsess. I imagine at some point, it but be an addiction in the same way. 

I've had moments in my life where dating wasn't like this--usually it's when I date calm people or very deliberately scale back my efforts. My most successful dating was done when I felt totally myself and was willing to go slow. But that feels so hard now!

I'm not sure what I'm trying to say or if anyone relates. My biggest fear is that my dating drama will mess with my sobriety eventually. I haven't felt the need to drink yet in the midst of all this. I'm almost at 6 months!  But I do worry.

I'm about to hit 4 months sober on my birthday the day after tomorow!  It will also be my first day at a new job after almost a full year unemployed too.  For the past 5 or 6 weekends(lost count honestly) I have been going on 5-10 mile hikes with my sister every sunday.  This weekend we did a ~1hr low impact on Saturday and 8.5 mile moderate trail on Sunday-this is something I have not been able to so since I was in highschool!  Felt awesome.

On to today's fabulous adventures...

I woke up early and walked down to the dollar store to get some fresh air and rubber gloves.  I was not going to mess up my nails to paint a mailbox!  Got everything, sucked down an ice coffee and brought my paint, brushes, tarp and gloves outside.

Wasps.  So.  Many.  Wasps.

I painted for a good 15-20 minutes before they really started swarming, so I moved my supplies to the porch and went inside for a little break.  Went back out and managed to finish without too much bother from them, got to the front of the mailbox, take a peak inside...nest.  our metal box is covered with a cute wooden frame with a sloping roof that looks similar to a bird house.  Right in between the roof and the mailbox is a nest 🤦‍♀️  Well, I'm not one to mess with nature so I left them alone the best I could and they mostly left me alone too.  Unfortunately this means I have to inform my sister/BIL there is a wasp nest in the mailbox.  First strike.

I get everything inside and put away when I hear something familiar coming up the road.  I get outside just in time to see the poor mail lady stopped in front of our house, wiping her hands.  They usually deliver by 1pm and I started painting around 1:20 thinking we just had no mail or I would catch them if they were late 😐  I appologized profusely and she told me she was just glad it was only paint(its brown...so I'd be nervous too haha), but I feel like a total airhead.  I shouldve guessed they'd be late on a Monday.  Strike 2.

So I'm trying to simmer down from dealing with wasps and inadvertently painting the mail courier.  I go to the bathroom and proceed to pull some tissue from the roll...the swinging arm of the dispenser falls right off and the screw?  The screw falls right into the decorative mount.  The decorative mount with no external screws/etc so I have no freaking clue how to get it off and fix the mechanism back on.  I looked inside with a flash light and saw upward arrows on a bracket so I thought sliding it upward may dislodge it ...well it slid up.  It also scraped off a nice little chunk of paint from the wall.  It also did not dislodge so I still cant fix it.  I tried finding same/similar model online to see if they had instructions explaining how to remove it from the bracket, no such luck.  BIL gets home in an hour and now I also have to tell him I broke the damn tissue roll holder.  Strike 3.

My BIL already seems a little irritated with me being here lately and just recently the same thing happened with the oven handle and I had to help him remove the whole inner panel of the oven door just to put a stupid screw back on.

All I want to do right now is guzzle cheap vodka and cry.  I swear I try to help out, do the right things, stay positive and it always backfires horribly somehow.  1 step forward 300 steps back.  I'm really trying to keep a cool head right now, it's just turning out to be a hard day.

EDIT:  BIL was understanding and it turns out the bracket was mounted diagonally and that's why it didnt release when I pulled it directly up 🤦‍♀️  Tissue dispenser is now successfully fixed and crisis averted.  Thank you to those who replied and sent me words of encouragement, you're all incredibly kind and I'm thankful for your time 🙏

Unsurprisingly, I followed the above statement with, ""drinking is the symptom and it's going to take your life. And you're letting it happen because your mental health is both the cause and outcome."" We breezed through a handful of topics like the selfish nature of suicide-by-negligence juxtaposed against the hellish nightmare of waking up after a bender and realizing it's not over yet; you're still alive and none of *this* went away.

Oh, I get it. I know what it's like to allow the warm embrace of giving up. The enveloping darkness of shutting down. The weightlessness of submitting to thy master. And for a brief period of time, it all goes quiet; the shrieking sounds, the glaring sights, the piercing pressure of ""fix this."" It all squelches out. The feelings flop to the ground, evacuated. The sweet release of letting off the gas, dropping the wheel and letting it all happen without a struggle.

She's still under the spell that the grass is greener in the cemetery. It was surreal to tell someone they are killing themself and have them agree. And it really really really sucks because I've been there and I managed to climb out of it far enough to see how the dark influence of suicide makes drinking yourself to death seem a going away party instead of the thunderclap of consequences everyone else has to deal with after you're gone. I told her, ""I don't know if I'll attend your funeral. I'll be so angry and confused.""

I know many of the answers she seeks but it does not work that way. You don't quit drinking because someone else told you to; you quit drinking because you love yourself enough to endure the pain; to wake up again tomorrow and to try YET AGAIN to make sense out of the chaos because this is worth it. And I don't think she believes it is.

I quit drinking because she needed a good example to follow. I continued because, even though *I have fallen and I am hurt, I will get back up again, even if it means falling again. Because this is worth it.*

I went to AA every week when first getting sober and loved it. I got my coins, I started doing the work and kept coming back. After a while I missed a week here or there because I had gotten sober and didn't feel like I needed it to stay sober anymore. But then I started listening to AA podcasts and AA speakers and realized that AA was for me to get sober at the beginning, but now that I don't have this terrible urge to drink anymore I need AA to help others. I need to be a sponsor and help other alcoholics. But after I went back to my normal meeting I started to notice things.. I went back to my normal meeting after a month or two and when it was my turn to speak I said I am still sober and just need help figuring out what to do next.. my meeting leader said ""you're still sober?!?"" In a tone that I didn't like. So I started going to other meetings and didn't have great experiences there either. There's just something about meetings and hearing all of these old war stories every week, watching all these old guys and gals get their five year coins, and their ten year coins while the guy in the back is struggling to stay sober for more than 24 hours.. and hes sitting there watching all of these people celebrate ten years and then that guy never shows up again.. I know this is a bit of a rant and I didn't want it to be . I just feel lost when it comes to AA. I'm sober and staying sober but whenever I go to a meeting now it feels like I'm being looked down on. Idk how to explain it but I want to help people. I want to help alcoholics and drug addicts, but whenever I go to meetings it doesn't sit right with me. People say ""go to another meeting, you'll find one you like"" but I've gone to about twenty meetings in my area and I'm just having trouble staying on the AA path. I know I'm not gonna drink again, but I also want to help people.

2021-11-15 14:42:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/quoky6/back_here_again_for_another_try/,Back here again for another try,"I have lurked this sub for a few years and made many failed attempts at sobriety. I would have to say I have been an alcoholic for about 10 solid years since I was 24. After a breakup I just started spending a lot of time alone drinking wine and it became a part of my life that followed me into my next several relationships and wreaked more and more havoc on my life. 

Drinking has become so much a part of who I am and the people I hang around with, it has become so hard to stop. I guess you could also say I have an addictive personality because I also have had a habit of abusing all sorts of different drugs ranging from caffeine to cocaine and everything in between. With all that being said I have a pretty good life that I have put together and maintained for myself all while battling these addictions. 

During my current relationship (which basically started when covid began) I have managed to keep the blackouts pretty much under control since I haven’t been going out, I usually drink less at home, although it is pretty much a daily occurrence. However now I am noticing that almost every time I go out, I black out, even if I have only had 5 or 6 drinks. Despite thinking I will be able to control my consumption, I never do. The alcohol kicks in and I forget how to stop. I lose control and become everything I hate. Immature, dramatic, aggressive, abusive, needy, pathetic. 

I don’t want to do this anymore, but no one seems to understand, I am not like them. I am never going to be the girl you can bring to the bar and not worry about. I can’t go to house parties or clubs or festivals. Im not good in large groups. I don’t know how to have 1 glass of wine with dinner. For years I have been told “you just have to set limits”. But they don’t understand I CANT. I have tried and tried and tried and failed, always to end up back in the same spot. Waking up not remembering what happened covered in bruises, filled with shame, picking the bottle back up and sinking into darkness until I can muster the strength to pull myself out again. 

I’m sorry to my boyfriend and friends that just want to have a good time with me. I’m just not that person. I can’t afford to keep putting myself back together again. I’m tired. And today I am not drinking, and I am going to try to figure out how my life will be without alcohol in it. Thanks for reading this far. Iwndwyt",5

I feel the same now as I felt two years ago minus the pervasive angst. 

It'd odd in a way because I'm doing lots of sport now which I had given up for years and I'm in better physical shape than I've been since turning 17. My memory is also back and I often get comments about how sharp it is. I now work in tech in a big city and I'm making decent money and I feel more in control than I ever have perhaps. 

I do miss the parties and drinks with friends though and though I've gained a lot of assurance in these last two years I still feel a bit sad at times that I won't knock back a few with the lads. I'm almost thirty and people around me still party a bit. Being sober has brought me many things which is why I keep on going and I can tell it's also having a positive effect on my surroundings as I can help my friends and family much better.

Overall my mood is great which is very nice as I have somewhat neurotic tendencies where I can low key obsess about things on which I have little control. 

In spite of all this I sometimes regret my old flamboyant impulsive self and the image I thought people had of me. I'm definitely coming off as quite serious now and perhaps even a bit intense. Now the thing is that even as a kid I was quite serious and during the end of my wild years I wasn't as flamboyant as I want to believe, I was often tired not sleeping well and doing zero sport.

I guess I'm just writing this to say that I miss late nights with an extra drink where ""you're drunk anyway so you don't really know what you're saying anyway"". I'm sharp all the time now and there are never excuses for what I say which is a bit annoying at times. I miss the times when ""everyone is drunk and you can share personal stuff because everyone is drunk and might not remember anyway"". I can tell people are more moderate around me, perhaps due to the fact I used to be the kind of guy to low key push for that extra drink because ""who cares about tomorrow anyway?"".

I'm feeling great usually and just a bit down tonight, actually I wrote a first draft of this post that I lost which was much more upbeat. My point perhaps is that being sober in ones late twenties is a bit of a social drag, let's face it, but I'd do it again anytime as I don't see how it could have gone better. Being sober brought me what I was hoping for at less than what I thought it would cost me.

Now that I have had a couple of sober weekends, I am feeling really good about my sober journey. To preface, I have had a really difficult year as I had two miscarriages. I've dealt with anxiety and depression in the past, but after those events, I really went to a dark place. I am doing therapy again and I am on Zoloft, but before I was still drinking a lot which kept me depressed and anxious and the medication wasn't able to give me the full effects. 

So I started with ""No Alcohol November"". This Saturday was going to really be a test for me and I felt like I passed with flying colors. I went out with my husband and his group of friends to a big bonfire event. Of course, there was a lot of drinking going on, but I did not partake at all. I drank NA Heineken and a couple of red bulls to stay awake. A few of my husband's friends did ask if I wanted a drink and I said ""no, thank you"" and there was no pressure at all from them to drink. I was actually very supported by them even though they were all pretty drunk. 

Then yesterday (Sunday), my husband and I went out for a bike ride. The first win was that I wasn't hungover for the ride! We got about 40 minutes in though and I ended up flipping over my handlebars after panic braking with the front brakes. Luckily nothing is broken, but I am very sore and I have quite a bit of bruising all over my right side. We went to a brewery afterward for lunch and while I did want a beer after that fall, I ordered a lemonade instead. 

In all, I came out of the weekend a little beat up, but I was sober! IWNDWYT",11

I’ve been a high functioning alcoholic for at least 10 years. I’ve been actively trying to stop drinking for at least two years, but have never made it past 5 days (and only a few times). This is largely due to my horrible social anxiety, which I would more accurately describe as people anxiety, because I seem to be incapable of being around any person without drinking, even my closest friends… who are also heavy drinkers. 
I was “diagnosed” (not really but it seems the most plausible explanation) almost a year ago with PCOS, and it has ravaged my body and my mental health. I now have most of the symptoms under control but I continue to lose hair at a worrying, and noticeable rate. I finally made an appointment with my GP and she prescribed me a medication but I cannot drink on it, or so it says. If I lose my hair I will be devastated but my alcoholic brain keeps telling me sobriety is worse. Looking for advice and encouragement. Is there anyone else struggling with PCOS who has been in this type of situation? I don’t know what to do.",6

By actually reading and ingesting instead of glazing over and taking what I want I realized that my own hubris and arrogance has kept me from really participating in a recovery program.

I simply did not drink, until I did. I knew how to stay sober, until I didn't. I was smarter until I wasn't. The high of the first weeks of sobriety fades and so do the memories of why I was attempting sobriety in the first place. Each time would feel the same to me and would stress the relationship fractures to the point of breaking. So I do not wanna be a dry drunk anymore.

Anyway, the meds noticeably helped me manage my focus better even while I was still drinking, so I'm legitimately excited to see how much they help now that I'm not actively working against them every day! Also excited because I know one ""reason"" I would drink was to try to get my brain to focus when I needed it to and my other tools weren't working. I've seen before that while I still have to put the effort in, the meds help it not be so overwhelming. 

Last time I quit I hadn't been diagnosed or gone on meds (we still thought I was just depression/anxiety) so I'm also cautiously optimistic that being effectively treated for my underlying issues this time will help me avoid relapse. Again, I know I'll still have to put in the work to not relapse, it's just exciting to know that this time I'm treating the underlying stuff as I go.",7

He finally decided on seeking treatment this year, and managed to stay sober for two months. I was, and still am, really proud of his feat. I instantly noticed, and told him about, his return of confidence... He seemed so much more alive. Unfortunately things derailed after that, and the situation actually got worse. 

Living in a different city and being swarmed by life myself made me not see him for three months, but I call him up at least once a week to talk. Over the phone  I already realized he was becoming less himself, and when I finally saw him these two days my mind could hardly process his current state. 

He's lost so much weight, his eyes look hollow. He will repeat the same sentences over and over again. Little of what he says makes sense. Constant mood swings. Sudden manic laughter. He's fallen out of his window, and I'd to save him from falling out of the window twice myself. Got a huge scar across his forearm from where he tried to cut himself. He's been beaten by family as a response to his aggression, dad and brother moved out for their own safety, been locked up in jail for 8 hours for disturbing public order after which he got prescribed lorazepam ''to keep him calm''. WHAT?! He's only really gotten physically aggressive towards me AFTER taking lorazepam, and he forgets when he takes them. His place is an absolute mess, holes in everything, broken furniture, broken glass. Everything is lying everywhere. He just throws around all the time. 

I just can't describe how different he looks and acts. I don't know what to do. I don't even know how much it helps him for me to be there, or to call him up and talk (not that the conversations make any sense at this point). One moment he'll tell me he's proud of having me as his friend, the next he threatens to call the police and to kick me out of his home. Then again he tells me to please stay. I don't take anything he does or says personally or seriously, but I see the outcry for help in his strange behaviour. I just stay calm and let him do and say whatever. What else can I do? This should never have come this far. I think he might be experiencing brain damage, and we already knew his liver wasn't liking this either. I don't even know if this behaviour is because of the alcohol, or if he wakes up like this too. 

Is there anything I can do?",5

Then I stayed sober to nurse her, then I stayed sober to take care of her. I was pregnant again and before I knew it 2 years of sobriety had passed. Those were the easy years. 

I decided, I can do another year. I did. Then another and another, until I hit 7. Then my world fell apart. 

Mentally, I’m so spent. I want to crawl back into my pit and just feel my misery. The only thing keeping me sober is thinking of my children dissecting their childhoods with a professional and wondering why they drink so much. 

I found this sub yesterday and reading everyone else’s victories has lifted me so much. Thank you.

So, for me, there is no ""just one bite"" of a normal pizza. I have to be careful. Even a crumb can make me sick. I'm careful when we go out. Does that restaurant share fryers? Change gloves? Have options for me beyond eggs and bacon (I'm looking at you, Cracker Barrel 😐).

Are there times when I wish I could eat gluten? Yeah absolutely. Like when my husband can order a giant cinnamon roll the size of his head for dessert and all they can offer me is plain Vanilla ice cream in a bowl. 

Here's the thing - that desire is fleeting because I've also felt the pain associated with the outcome. A ""bloat"" so intense my stomach swells in size and feels like one sharp poke of a needle could pop it. The vomiting. The lack of energy for days after, the headaches, the nausea. The endoscopies and blood work. 

I dont wish I could eat it, because I know that I can't. 

My life is really only worth living, if I can stand to live it. And the only way that happens is if I avoid gluten.

About ten days ago I got a check for a few hundred bucks I hadn't been expecting/forgot would show up. My mom has been helping me manage my money by hanging onto my debit card, because I tend to make poor decisions when I have money in my pocket. 

I cashed the check and had the money for a few days without dipping into it, thinking all was fine since I'd been in AA daily and feeling good. This was not the case.  Queue me getting drunk for 6 days straight just as hard as ever. Blew off work, and avoided everyone for most of that time. 

Feeling like I took 2 steps forward and 5 steps back. Back to day 2 again, and not very encouraged.

Having to watch him slowly degrade into someone who could no longer take care of himself over the course of the pandemic (18 months for us) and then end up in hospital care for the remaining month of his life has changed how I view my drinking. 

I always felt that if I chose to drink myself to death it would be a private battle that I fought alone but I now realise that it does affect the people closest to me. It's not neccesarily my behaviour, although that can be an issue, it's more about the people watching me destroy myself. 

I've never had to see this happen before and I never want to see it again. It happens so slowly but consistently as your body gives up because it can't heal while we abuse alcohol. 

Our lives were consumed with helping someone who had given up on themself. I can no longer do this to myself or the ones that love me the most. I still struggle with my addiction but I am fighting to be healthy.

My pattern is mostly moderate drinking with a binge that happens like once a month. The moderate drinking turns into drinking at home which sometimes turns into overdoing it. I know I have a problem and have struggled to turn the tide back, but I have also come very far from where I was (drinking daily a few years ago) so I remind myself that I'm heading in the right direction.  

Anyway Saturday I had a couple beers at lunch and a couple glasses of wine while out to dinner with the husband. We had a babysitter and went out for dinner & a movie (Dune was amazing).  Felt really nice and enjoyed it all. Friday I had an urge to open a bottle of wine at home because it would be ""so relaxing"" but I managed to get through the urge and didn't drink. I also didn't drink yesterday and I was watching TV with my little son (he's 4) last night before he went to bed. He asked to look at my eyes and we stared at each other (just being silly) and I just looked at his precious perfect little face that was so bemused with what color our eyes were and I just love him so much it makes me want to cry that I'm having to deal with this issue that is detrimental to not only my health but potentially my children. I don't want to be a drunk mom and have health issues that could impact our family. 

I have my annual check-up tomorrow and I'm worried about how my blood tests are going to come out. My husband recently had his and he has elevated bilirubin which could be liver damage (googling)?? (he doesn't have a problem like I do but also drinks). I'm just riddled with anxiety about potential damage I may have done and scared about my future.  I know I should stop completely but I still enjoy the days like Saturday and it's hard to completely give up. Anyway thanks for reading, I think I just wrote this to get my anxieties out of my head and into the world or something. Appreciate you all. IWNDWYT",5
2021-11-15 09:50:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qui4ot/an_observation/,An observation,"Over the weekend, we visited my friend and her husband in Boston. I’ve known my friend since we were 5, and she has never been a big drinker. Her mom was a bad alcoholic so she avoided alcohol entirely through high school and college and only now will she have the occasional drink. As a result, alcohol has never been a focus of our friendship.

Last year, when I was about 2 months sober, I visited a different friend. She was someone I regularly drank with, and though she is also a good friend, our activities were often centered around alcohol.

During that visit last year, I was obsessed with drinking. I had fun but kept thinking it would have been more fun if we had been drinking. Conversely, I hardly even noticed not drinking while visiting my other friend in Boston. We had a blast and I didn’t even consider that alcohol would have made it better. We even ate dinner at a dive bar, and I happily enjoyed my hot tea and massive burger haha. 

I found it so interesting how my past habits informed my current cravings. My brain wasn’t expecting to get hammered with my friend this weekend, so I didn’t miss it. It also helped me see that having more sober days than not over the past couple years has helped me practice sobriety and made certain situations/events easier to handle.

Have a great Monday, all. IWNDWYT",10

Long story short I drank dangerously after showing up drunk, flirted with other guys, hid from the wonderful person, blacked out. Was told by the guy that his friends said I punched someone. This explains my fuzzy memory of being kicked out.  

I removed myself from the group and won’t darken their door again. It’s sad because they are nice and I liked many of them. 

I do this over and over. My fix in the past is to just not go out. I drink way less than I used to. Keep it to weekends. But this approach seems to justify the excess in my mind.

This is a thought I've had gently simmering on the back burner for a while. I love advent calendars, and in the past (albeit in completely different contexts) I've participated in and seen a lot of different ""games"" like this. 

Basically, I thought it might be fun to do a daily post thing for every day leading up to christmas, where every day has a different theme, thought or other inspiration for all of us to write something down. Both like/either as a tiny lil daily meditation or check-in, and as a way to think and talk about specific parts of our recovery journeys.

The ""X days of Christmas"" is as much of an excuse to get it done as it is a catchy name for the event as it is because a lot of people might need some extra support leading up to the holidays. It could be christmas themed, it could not be, that is all the same to me!

To give a clear example, I'm imagining something like this: Every day, I can make a post with todays theme/thought/whatever, and we can all take the time to write down something on it. A sentence or two or a small novel, doesn't matter.

Just pulling something out of thin air here, it could look like:

Day 1 (Dec 1st): Worries and/or fears

Day 2 (Dec 2nd): Your favourite (or least favourite) moment of the day

Day 3 (Dec 3rd): Chores and routines

Day 4 (Dec 4th): Small victories

Day 5 (Dec 5th): Small annoyances

etc etc, for all the days leading up to Christmas (or all the way to new year's, if we want). These are just tiny things I came up with right now on the spot lol, but I hope the idea comes through! :-)

It could be way more christmas themed or not christmas themed at all, by the way. I'm open for all suggestions!

Would you be interested in joining in? Like a themed daily check-in for the month of December!",120

I got sober last year for about 2, 2 and half months, and it was crazy how much easier things got. Waking up was, funny to say, enjoyable. I didn’t feel anxious constantly. Tracking my money, my diet, my life, all of it was so much easier. It was like I’d been playing a video game on hard mode and all I had to do all this time was stop drinking and things got easier. 

And then I started drinking again. At first I had a pretty good handle on it. Few beers here and there but never getting out of my mind drunk. Until I was. And then going through the same old dance in my mind,lying to myself, lying to people around me. Having to borrow money and make up bullshit excuses as to why. Knowing people probably knew they were bullshit too. 

I’ve got 2 days. Yesterday I was hungover, today I’m not. I want to focus on this feeling and get better.

It's Media Monday, the thread in which we discuss the books, movies, TV shows, YouTube channels, video games, podcasts, songs, and more that are helping us out with our sober lives. 

I have been reading *The Great Circle*, which is excellent so far but contains much CFHRD (consequence-free heavily romanticized drinking) like so many contemporary novels. It got me thinking, are there any novels or shows that do not feature alcoholism as a main story arc but also show alcohol negatively impacting people? And I'm struggling to think of a single one.

I still have no TV hooked up here so to watch shows would be watching on my laptop or my Kindle Fire. It's not as fun for me that way so I'm not watching much. I haven't watched anything since *Squid Game*. I started *Ted Lasso* but kind of petered out on it. Anything great going on in TV-land?

It was easier than I thought to give it up. I mean, after dozens and dozens of embarassing situations stuck in my head (physical fights, embarassing and silly behaviour, inappropriate and aggressive outburts), it became harder and harder to forgive myself. I knew alcohol wasnt a dear friend of mine. In fact, I still see it as poison. The only way I could forgive myself was by stopping drinking.

I drank coz I thought I could trust myself to drink. But boy was I wrong. I probably made a fool of myself again in front of others. I came home and threw up. Im still feeling the effects of this drinking episode. My stomach hurt all day yesterday and my appetite was surpressed. I felt anxious and depressed all day. But I need to start all over, and forgiving and promising myself is the first step. 

I just wanted to ask two questions:
1/ When drinking, is it common for a person to make a fool of themselves? Do you often see this happen or am I the rare exception?

2/ Do you, and can anyone explain WHY we feel guilty and depressed the day after a massive drink session?",4

I didn't even subscribe until recently because even that felt a little too real.

I'll try to make this a long story short. Four years ago my marriage broke up and, while I used to drink quite often back then, after finding my own home I'd often be stuck here alone. Years of a busy home, a million things to do, three kids and a hectic job, it wasn't often I'd be alone, let alone lonely. As someone with pretty bad depression that was important to me. 

Before the marriage ended I went on a big weight loss kick and got super fit. I was proud of myself and continued that for a while after the break up. I was dating and everything was grand. 

Then taking a new job a million miles away meant I could no longer be there for the school run. It was a difficult choice but I didn't have a lot of options. I took the job and my time with the kids went from every second week to every second weekend. 

For 12 out of 14 nights I'd sit alone at home, often just on the floor in silence. As I got lonelier I started to drink more and more. 

For the past two years it's all I do when the kids aren't here. More recently I do when the kids go to bed. And not just a little. Not even a dozen beers. A few dozen a night, or however many I'd get through before blackout. 

It started to surprise me that I never really felt hung over anymore, just deeply depressed and directionless. My mornings consisted of the deep shame of looking into my messages to see which recent Tinder exes I'd sent ""I miss you so much"" messages to the night before - invariably one or two. 

I'm not sure what's happened this week or why, but yesterday I didn't buy alcohol. I think it was because I didn't get time while the kids were here and I'd bought from the local store the three days prior and couldn't handle the guilt of being seen there for a fourth day in a row buying another 24 beers. 

So here I am. It's day two and I'm drinking ice water. It's not easy but I'm starting to realise that those months on end ""without a hangover"" were a lie. I was hung over. Permanently. I'm in my quiet house alone right now, and smiled the first unexpected smile in years just before - that's what's prompting me to post. Maybe this is the way to finally feeling happy again. 

Anyway, apologies for the dissertation. Here's to the clarity.

EDIT: Waking up to such a huge wave of support this morning is something else. I was nervous that if anyone commented on this I'd be deeply embarrassed and just delete the post. Instead it's steeled my resolve and made me a lot more confident that this is something I can do too.

It was also nice to wake up this morning, see all the notifications and remember why I have notifications on my phone. It's been a while. 

I woke up at 5:30am and, for the first time in many many years, felt refreshed. Like I had actually slept and went through something restorative as opposed to having had the plug pulled. 

Usually I drag myself out of bed, stumble to the fridge to see how many I got through the night before, hoping they're all gone so I can ""quit"" that day. This morning I couldn't fall asleep again, my body didn't need more sleep, so I got up and took the dog for an hour walk then sat on the beach while he went for a swim. 

Thank you, guys. Your support means a lot and I'm looking forward to being part of this community.",839

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning Monday!

Due to our beloved SaintHomer having to juggle Check-in hosts this week, I will be your enthusiastic but rather underprepared host this week! Not to worry, some of the best things in my life have happened when I’ve had to fly by the seat of my pants, rather than spreadsheet every detail like I usually do.

Take my sobriety, for example.  I had known for several years that someday I would have to quit for good.  I had stopped three or four times previously, but always managed to persuade myself that a break was all I needed.  I did the moderation tango very well, repeatedly.

I certainly didn’t know, as I guzzled lukewarm shitty dyed orange ‘rosé’ with people I barely liked, that this would be the last booze that I’d ever consume.  Being unprepared was good.  There was no ritual, no goodbye, no mourning for what could have been. When I woke on the final morning, tasting and feeling the horror of the blacked out night before, I knew I was done.

The plan turned out to be pretty simple.  Don’t drink today.  It took a lot of work, for such a simple plan.  It’s considerably easier, however, to do it with you all here, by my side.

So, my friends, if you care to share, did you have a plan when you started out on this journey?",398

I do feel though that I'm at a point where I want to stop. My reasons are; I truly don't enjoy it and what it does to my personal life. I feel truly chaotic and unpredictable at times. I feel like my cognition is suffering. Even after a few days of not drinking I feel much clearer. And money, I've quit smoking in hopes of scrounging just a couple more yearly dollars and this is the next thing to go. 

I've drank since the age of 13 but since my early twenties have drank around 8-15 beers a night. This has varied and has become less with age. Now it seems to be more bingeing. 15-18 every 3 days. 

Ultimately I want to stop. It is an overwhelming thought. I do not know if I should be seeing a doctor. ( Would prefer not ) my father was ill prescribed medication when he tried to stop and while he did; it caused him many hardships. I'm distrusting.

I would like to know an approximate timeline of what to expect and any tips and tricks to get through it. I'm interested to see when and if folk had noticable emotional and cognitive differences and at what periods of quitting. I know this can wildly vary but I enjoy structure.

My ID documents have all had various issues over the years, but usually it hasn't caused major issues.

My birth certificate has the wrong spelling for my first name. My drivers license has the wrong first and last name. I tried to get these corrected in the past, but they refuse to do so without me proving my identity, which I can't do. The whole situation is a catch-22, even my goddamn tax file number lists me as a non-resident despite the fact I was born in Australia and have only ever left the country for 2 fucking weeks to visit New Zealand in high school.

Now today, I was unable to prove my identity for this stupid digital certificate. I have a paper one, but the digital one would make my life easier, and frankly it pisses me off that I have a medicare card but that's not good enough to prove who I am. I don't even understand how the fuck I got approved for a centrelink payment when I literally used the same ID that they are now rejecting. And that was only a couple of months ago I got the payment.

So fun times. I literally started screaming fuck over and over again after getting off the phone, and I am dreading the prospect of trying to sort this out. I can make do with a paper certificate for now, but this shit with my ID is becoming a real issue, and I can't seem to do anything about it. I am considering contacting legal aid (free legal advice service) to see if there is any way to actually fix this.

The guy on the phone today suggested renewing my old passport, except the name on that is fucking wrong too. They used the spelling of my first name from the birth certificate.

This has made me unbelievably angry, but I am still not going to resort to drinking. In the past this would have been the excuse to wipe myself out, just to avoid this feeling of anger. That said, I am still unbelievably pissed off, I'm going to try working out to burn off some of this energy...

I constantly remind myself the reasons of why I stopped drinking so it’s not like I have forgotten because of course, how could I? But somehow now, 435 days later why does it seem as if sobriety is only getting harder. Sometimes I feel like I should give myself a break since all this time has passed.

And Returned, Sober! + Had a great moment.","Over the weekend, I went on a trip with a group of my dearest friends. I do plenty of non-drinking activities with them too and none of them have an alcohol problem, except me. And all are very supportive when I say I am sober.

While everyone had a few drinks on the trip, and while at one point it was really difficult for me, I did not drink. And I really mean a few drinks. A group of four shared a single bottle of wine and didn't finish it. I'd have had 3 by myself if I had been drinking. 

It's Monday morning where I am and I am sober and fresh and feeling good. This is a stark contrast to two weeks ago when I had an uncontrolled spiral into oblivion after drinking again for a couple of months (moderately, for me at least, until the spiral) after an 18 month-long stint of sobriety. 

That weekend 2 weeks ago, I spent a fortune, don't remember what I did and just wanted to end it all on the Monday. So, I am happy. But I don't consider this any great victory, because I believe that victory lies in the conscientious and rigorous adherence to the process of sobriety. However, it is satisfying and I cannot believe how much better I feel in just two weeks. 

Also, on this trip I had the most inspiring moment for sobriety I have ever had. I was having a deep conversation with a friend of mine and she told me how her dad was an alcoholic. I had no idea. And later she went on to say how she has seen my struggle towards sobriety and appreciates it, which in itself was encouraging. Then she caught me totally off guard and said, 'I wish my father had been like you.'

I don't know why, but these words have struck me in a way I cannot explain. And for some reason, those words have made all the suffering worthwhile somehow, and they will remain with me for the rest of my life and process of sobriety to inspire me when my morale drops. 

There are obviously, as we all know, no guarantees in this game. But I am truly committed to life-long sobriety and teetotalism, henceforth. Someday, in the future, once I have many days of sobriety under my belt, I shall tell her how important her words were to me. 

I also want to say that I have found immense support in this subredit and I want to say a big thank you to everyone. I will be sober with you today, and tomorrow and the day after that, until the end of our days. 

Good luck to all on this journey. 

Have a good day and a great week.",23

Now: I'm not so much depressed but I've discovered that I am very angry. Not domestic violence angry, but mad at the political situation, masking drama, vaxing drama, banning books (WTF?!?!) all that shit. WE'RE ADULTS here!!!! ahh I digress...

Anyway, I've lost 7 lbs, but I don't feel any better health wise. I miss the taste of wine. I've resorted to drinking non-alcoholic beers and that has been a fantastic substitute.  I think I HAVE a drinking problem, and I literally mean DRINKING ANYTHING.  Mineral water and club soda have been a hit.  I've also taken up eating sunflower seeds (one habit to replace another). 

While I'm pleased that my sober-November is half way through tomorrow, I am not happier that I'm not drinking, and i think that makes me the angriest. I thought I was going to feel GREAT! nope. Same ol shit, nothing to distract me from it.

Anyway, it's the hard cold truth. I'll check in next week before thanksgiving.

Anything prepared with wine or port or even something like mirin, I stay away from. To me it’s a slippery slope from there to other excuses to sneak alcohol in. 

The other night I was having dinner and noticed something on the menu I thought I’d like, but I knew it was typically prepared with either white wine or vinegar. I asked how they prepared it. He said with white wine, so I ordered something else. It didn’t have sauce or preparation or anything else listed.

A few minutes later he comes back and says “hi, that’s actually prepared with a red wine glaze, did you want to forego that?” I of course said yes, please, and thanked him profusely (and tipped him big). 

This might be a silly thing, but I think that waiter helped me stay sober the other night by noticing that this was important to me and taking the extra thirty seconds to come back and tell me that. 

Don’t be afraid to ask about stuff like this, y’all! Don’t let being worried about upsetting or inconveniencing someone be a risk to your sobriety. And if you’re a server or someone who has the opportunity to help someone in this way, PLEASE take that extra moment.

I am 7 months sober, and there have been a few times throughout I’ve felt that FOMO. Through patience, hard work, and so much support, this weekend was not one of those times. 

I just arrived back in Wisconsin after spending 4 days in Mexico, at an all-inclusive resort, for my cousins wedding. I had very few moments where having a drink came to mind, and even in those moments it never sounded like something I wanted. I had more fun with my wife and my family during this trip than I have ever had in Mexico, including for my honeymoon. My sobriety was not a challenge, it was a gift. I enjoyed every morning, went on adventures, truly relaxed, and enjoyed all of the amenities of the fine resort, minus the booze. For those of you who dread a life without alcohol, give it time. After this weekend I am so excited for all of the joys life offers, and if you aren’t there yet, be patient with yourself.

I’ve been considering getting a dog to help cope with my depression and anxiety (in addition to my ongoing therapy and medication). And it seems to me that if I had a dog at home I’d really go out a lot less if at all. But I don’t know if that’s just wishful thinking.

Has anyone’s drinking been negatively or positively impacted by getting a dog? How has it helped or hurt you?",11

For 5 years I’ve been a regular drinker. Over that period there have been times where alcohol wasn’t enough and it lead to cocaine. In the last year the cocaine use has gotten worse along with the drinking.

My life consists of being late paying bills and having letters constantly, whether it’s fines for late payments or just reminders of existing late payments.

My mental health is a mess. I’m depressed in the nights, worrying about my finances, the future etc… So much so my sex drive has depleted. I’m stuck.

I have a good profession and due to my
bad habits I’m not as successful as I should be never mind as much as I could be. 

Last night I drank only 4 cans and a 500ml bottle of cider. Again, the alcohol took over and that ended up with a gram of cocaine. I didn’t get to sleep until 06:00.

It was at that time I decided I’m knocking this shit on the head. I need help. I need to do this.

I have hope and faith that this, for me, is the way to get out of this destructive cycle, this cycle, that is ruining my life.

I bought some weed earlier and through day 1.

I've always been a binge drinker since starting at 15. I used to drink only on weekends until blacking out, but for the last two years things started spiraling out of control. I started drinking more and more, my tolerance sky-rocketed to the point where I would finish 1 or 2 bottles of white wine and then continued with beer. I would sometimes do that for weeks. After those benders I would usually spend couple of days in bed, extremely depressed and then be back at it again to the point where I started hating myself. That hatred for myself lead me to my personal ""rock bottom"" where I self harmed while blacked out. I cannot describe the emotions I felt the  next day, it was so horrifying to me that I did that to myself since I'm not suicidal while sober. First week was the worst, I was extremely depressed and I didn't leave my house at all. That was the last time I drank alcohol, and with support of my loving husband and my best friend I'm taking it one day at the time. Sobriety didn't change my life upside down, I'm still somewhat depressed and anxious but emotionaly stable. Over the years I've lost trust in myself, so I really hope that this time I won't let ME down. This sub was a huge help and this is my first time posting here, hope I don't jinx myself!

The problem is that they act like my decision to stop drinking is fleeting or temporary; the few times I’ve hung out with them during my recent sobriety, they have still asked me if I want a drink or if I’m ‘drinking tonight’ lol. 


One of my best friends just went on a cruise and brought back a bottle of tequila with her today for me and my family(my family doesn’t really drink and she knows that). 
When I announced that I was going to quit, I also just felt like there was a little bit of a push for me to just slow down instead of stop, even though I expressed—then and several times before—the emotional struggles I was going through regarding my addiction. 


While I’m sure they’re not ill intentioned, and I’m not going to blow it up into a huge issue, it is honestly just kind of disappointing to see my sobriety dismissed. Especially because in the past my drinking has caused problems with our friendships and they had no issue calling me on it. 


I’m trying not to be annoyed and I don’t want to be dramatic about any of this, but it definitely makes me want to put distance between myself and them.

Many of my friends have now turned 21 so we are going out to more bars and venues that serve drinks and sometimes I feel a little left out not having a drink in my hand. My first time going to a bar a few weeks back I ordered a non-alcoholic beer and it tasted pretty bad and also very much like beer (I don't know what I was expecting honestly haha).

Anyway, I wanted to make this post and ask what kinds of mock-tails or other non-alcoholic drinks y'all recommend I try. 

Thanks!

I was in a similar boat last year when I was soaked to the gills. The reason for a couple of shots before an interview was to quell anxiety and it [did help somewhat](https://xkcd.com/323/).

... except it took me about 6 months to find a mediocre contract gig. For some reason I thought I was sober enough. I guess not. This time around? 20 days. Didn't even go full throttle applying.

It went so poorly that I got kicked out of the venue and I missed the main act. My ex who accompanied me got me home safely but in the mean time I tore into him and was just generally angry. 


I’ve been going on secret benders in cycles and I know it needs to end. I keep justifying it all and breaking promises with myself. My fiancé is a child of an alcoholic and he won’t let me drink at home so I end up doing it all in secret. The hiding, the tracking, the making sure the bottles are thrown away in a trash off the property. That’s trumped now by the embarrassment and deep, deep shame of how badly I fucked up last night.

Angry with me that I put myself and him through the annoyance and stress of being that drunk. But mainly he was very distressed with how drunk I was and concerned about my safety, fearing that I would accidentally hurt myself. 

I was scared straight for about a week and then drank a bit this past Wednesday. He ""caught"" me again, I wasn't problematically trashed but he's been on high alert. I don't want to play this game, for my own sake or for his. 

Today's the first night I'll be alone again since then and it's so fucking tempting to drink. I just finished a big project for work and have another one starting tomorrow so today is my one ""day off."" I really can't drink this work week because of the deadline I have. But my bf specifically called me out on the drinking when he's not around thing, talking about how now that's he's so worried it's not fun for him during his alone time to just be worried the whole time that I'm at home alone getting trashed. 

I want to show him I can do better, prove him wrong, be proud of myself for resisting. But I also just want to drink and ""take this opportunity"" since I won't drink any other days this week almost certainly. How can I get myself out of this mindset of ""opportunistic drinking""? It can be relatively easy to get a small streak going, 4-7 days, but eventually I'll get to a day where it's an ""opening"" to drink  where I feel like my logic is ""well, I've had a good streak going. I've got all this stuff coming up and won't have another chance to drink for X period of time so I should just drink today for the hell of it! and then I can start again tomorrow."" I'm not that dogmatic about the concept of a perfect counter or total sobriety but I also can't keep up this cycle of pouncing on random excuses to drink. I also just feel pissed off about feeling like I have to do it to prove it to my partner, even though I know that not drinking is the right thing to do.",6

Worried because people will be drinking.,"I absolutely love snooker and pool. Ever since I was a young teen (even before I could legally drink) I have played and practised multiple days a week. I don't know why it just is so fun to me, I love it. 

Most all of my friends are on the teams that I am also a competing member of. We play in tournaments and it's honestly a blast. 

The problem is, this favourite hobby of mine is always located at bars, clubs or places that sell alcohol.

Honestly, it probably worsened my alcoholism because I was practising, playing or competing 4 nights a week or so, and what the hell, might as well get a few pints whilst I am here. ""Everyone else is drinking, so it's fine"" mentality. 

Except they aren't alcoholics, they would have eaten that day and not be drinking on an empty stomach. They would have 1 or 2 drinks, I'd have 6-8. They went home after to sleep. I'd go home and got a bottle of spirits out and continue drinking alone.

I got hospitalized not long ago and today is my 20 days sober. I've told all of them why I was in hospital, and that I cannot drink, and they've been very supportive. They aren't the type of people to push me to drink.

Tonight a big group of us are planning to meet and play, I'm worried as I know this will be a temptation to me. My friends would likely stop me drinking but I don't want to be a burden on them, making them keep an eye on me.

So I am currently hyping myself up. Tonight I will not drink, I will enjoy my favourite hobby, playing sober just like when I was younger and didn't need to drink all the time. I will be with my friends and get a can of lemonade of coke. I will eat my low salt homecooked food so I arrive full and don't get a portion of salty chips.

Feeling confident, and wary. But I am young and I don't want to just live my life avoiding places that serve booze forever. I just need to be strong and when the bartender asks if I want my usual I will say no.",7

I wanted to share some takeaways from the experience. 

I brought a bottle of n/a wine so that I could feel like I was participating in the celebration. It ended up being a little redundant since there were plenty of non-alcoholic options, but I came prepared for myself. 

I didn’t push myself to be the social butterfly that I typically would be at a party like this. While I wasn’t anxious, I didn’t have the social lubricant that alcohol provides, so instead I caught up with the people I know, which was so great. And I remember our conversations today! Too many times I have made plans to catch up with friends and then I end up talking to some rando who I will never see again for half the night. I got to nurture some friendships last night!

My partner got to throw a few back and blow off some steam, without being on high alert for my mood to change or for me to get messy. My sobriety means that he gets to fully relax and have fun, not babysit me. While he might not feel 100% today, there is absolutely no emotional hangover. My drinking has robbed him of far too many potential good times, and it was fucking rad to see him having fun last night!

We left the party while it was going full-tilt, and it felt ok. I didn’t have to stay until the bitter end, throwing back shots and “fixing all the world’s problems”. I got up this morning a little tired, but I have the rest of the day off to relax and enjoy, not in any sort of physical or emotional pain. 

The longer I go without drinking the better it gets. Alcohol made me selfish, and I am finding so much more value in my friendships and my relationship with my partner now. The urge for me to drink diminishes substantially after each of these types of social experiences, and more of my compassion for others gets boosted. I didn’t know what I was missing out on, but now that I have it, it is so worth it.

I mean, the way it takes me ages to get moving in the morning on my days off, for one. I always chalked that up to not being a morning person plus ADHD executive function issues but you know what? A lot of that is probably left over from when I'd drink in the morning and not feel up to doing anything until I'd had ""enough"" in me. Same with having trouble doing things after work - some of that is natural coming down from the day, but some of it is because the first couple hours were reserved for drinking.

I must have heard/read a million times about forming new habits after getting sober, but I hadn't though about this one, probably bc it doesn't directly lead to cravings for me. It just means I'm sitting here watching Youtube for my entire morning vaguely feeling like there's probably something else I could be doing but not feeling like it's ""time"" to get moving yet. I'm used to that being the only way to spend my mornings bc I was drinking and also trying very hard not to think about my drinking.

I have since learned that SNS me DOES walk her dogs, but maybe not at 6 am. 😂 Regardless! While bumbling around my neighborhood at 6 am, I noticed all of these (presumably sober) people doing Sober Things that Drunk Me would not have considered doing at 6 am because hangover. Things like walking their own dogs, and jogging, and driving cars to be places at that ridiculous time of day. (SNS me is still not a huge morning person, but better than before. Because hangovers vs the lack there of.) It made me feel like I had joined a secret club. The Sober People Getting Shit Done Club. And if I'm in the club, then so are you. This thread is to brag about all of the cool (or for that matter, not so cool but hard, or even just day to day things that you my Fellow Sober People, have been getting done in your sober lives.)

Rules for club membership: 1. Do a Thing 2. Be sober while doing it 3. Tell us about it

My submission: 

I've been noticing lately that my kitchen just looked...I don't know, grimy. Like, all of the dishes were done, the countertops were clean, the floor was clean, but it still didn't look sparkly clean and nice. So, it was time to do something about it. I had a day off on Thursday, so I rolled up my sleeves and set to work. I Pine-Sol'ed basically everything that would stand still, including all of the fronts of the cabinets and drawers. I removed the hard water stains and shined all of the ""stainless"" appliances. I wiped down all of the various stuff that could accumulate dust (like, storage cannisters and jars.) I polished the hard wood floors. By the end of the day, I was stiff and creaky. But also, my kitchen looks amazing! *chef's kiss*

Now it's your turn! What have you been up to sober that you wouldn't have done or couldn't do drunk?

After drinking too much tequila too fast, I broke down to my fiance about how much I hate drinking, how much I hate waking up feeling like garbage, hating my body for the weight I've put on, hiding morning shots from shame and not being able to enjoy things I once loved doing if I'm not drunk.

I had been joking and hinting to her for a while about it, but I think I was in denial about how bad I allowed it to become. She was so incredibly supportive - she hid the rest of the hard liquor and is going to help me taper off on beer in case of any withdrawal symptoms. I'm really lucky to have a person who supports me like she does. 

I don't entirely know why I'm posting here. It's an appreciation of her and it feels good to tell people who understand my problem.

That’s scary to say if I am being honest with myself, but I do know my relationship with alcohol needed a change and I am happy to be taking the initial steps. The posts in here help alot.

Since October ended, I've had a harder time explaining why I'm not drinking. I don't know anyone who is sober and my friends and family don't understand why I would want to stop drinking. For now, I'm telling myself that's OK and this is for me and not for them. And since no one else would congratulate me on not drinking for 50 days straight, I'm sharing here. Woo hoo! IWNDWYT!",54

I don't have a car, so how the heck am i going to get rid of them? I'm in the process of packing them up in cases, but then what? 

I have so much else to do, and it makes me feel almost hopeless. But I figure if I can get rid of the empties, maybe the rest won't seem so impossible? They feel like a physical manifestation of my shame. 

We're talking about a few hundred wine bottles. All I can think of is maybe renting a truck, then spreading them out to multiple locations (bottle deposit locations around here usually limit you to 10 cases). It's going to be a lot of work, and thoroughly humiliating. But i guess it's what I've got to do?

But 99% of the time it doesn't feel like that. I just end up feeling icky and fuzzy-brained.

And lately, I feel like it's having a worse effect on me. I wake up with hangovers (which I never used to get from wine). I am F51 and I wonder if it's age-related. I just end up feeling dehydrated, headachy, and slightly nauseated the whole day afterwards lately. And all for nothing. Also, the last few days, drinking has made it so I want to fall asleep at 8, as in, I can't even keep my eyes open.

I went to a party for the first time since I quit drinking and didn’t have a drop of booze! I’m going to share my experience in detail in case it helps someone else who’s recently quit drinking and is trying to navigate having a social life with friends who are heavy drinkers. TLDR at the bottom. 

I posted last night before I went to my friends birthday party and got some great encouragement to not drink. I was a little nervous about the whole thing beforehand since I was always quite convinced that I had social anxiety and that alcohol was the reason I had fun (and was a lot of fun) in bigger social situations. It turned out I was wrong. 

I would normally pre-drink while getting ready for a night out but I had a coffee instead so I wouldn’t get sleepy. This gave me lots of energy so I walked the half hour to my friends place instead of taking an Uber. I got there and every one was drinking, there were 12 people and half were close friends and the other half were either acquaintances or I was just meeting them. 

The host knew that I’m not drinking so she got me a lemon water and I started mingling. I didn’t feel awkward at all being the only sober one and was relaxed and conversation flowed easily despite not having my usual social lubricant. People started doing karaoke which I usually love when I’m drunk but I just hung out chatting for a while thinking I wouldn’t have the nerve to do it sober. 

People were chugging booze and getting quickly drunker all around me. It was weird but I was barely tempted to drink at all. Just once when someone had a drink that I really used to like did I even consider maybe having a sip, but I quickly pushed that thought away. The drunker they got, the more sure I was of my decisions since they were so sloppy and ridiculous looking. It was kind of funny to watch actually (to a point). I eventually sang some karaoke songs since I figured they wouldn’t remember tomorrow anyway lol. It was a lot of fun!

My friend set up a fondue and some of the people started eating. I made tea and still didn’t feel like drinking which made it a lot easier than I expected. I had been there for three hours and a bunch of my friends were at the annoying drunk stage so I decided it was time to go home and chill. I said my goodbyes and one of my really drunk friends started trying to make out with me and begged me to stay but I told her I had to go (I wasn’t about to hook up with a drunk girl).

As I was leaving one of the girls was so drunk she had stabbed herself with a fondue fork and was getting first aid. It was a good reminder of why I had stopped drinking and made me feel like I was leaving at just the right time. Normally I would have been doing shots and had like 7-8 drinks by then. Getting blackout at a party was pretty standard for me and my friends.

I had a lovely half hour walk back home listening to tunes and enjoying the fall air and feeling so good about my decision not to drink. I woke up this morning 43 days sober and I’m super proud of myself that I didn’t cave and have to start at day 1 again. 

TLDR- I stayed sober at my friends booze-filled party and discovered that I wasn’t as socially anxious as I thought. I had a lot of fun even without alcohol. Being around drunk people was a good reminder of why I quit drinking. Waking up feeling clear headed and hangover-free is infinitely better. You will never regret your decision to not drink and life is just a series of decisions that you make. IWNDWYT!",29

I've been trying to quit alchohol this past year after I became an alcoholic during the 2 years of UK lockdown, I was drinking Rum several times a week with other drinks and substances as I was struggling badly being alone after a harsh breakup just as lockdown began and away from all my family.

It was impossible to explain how truly alone and broken I felt but around new year I began to try and quit, its not been easy as most my friends nearby also drank to numb their own pains and none of us helped eachother.

I managed to quit other substances officially 4 month ago now with honestly no urge to get any as the people I hung around were the only reason I ever got it, now I realize I was peer pressured and was desperate to not be alone.

I did manage to not drink for almost a month but the person who broke my heart beginning of lockdown proved they still don't truly care about me and screwed with my head and heart once again leaving me now traumatised by the concept of a relationship. I push everyone away now who even remotely gets emotionally close.. And I've begun binge drinking to the point I'm black out drunk, spending hundreds in just a few hours to numb how I truly feel.

4 days ago I went somewhere with a friend and did it again, I've no memory of the end of the night except for small fractions of it, but apparently a man tried sexually assaulting me and touching me whilst I was almost unconscious on the floor. My friend managed to get rid of him and get me into a taxi home...

I've had moments like this in the past where I'm drunk and can't recall anything, endangering me.

I've got BPD and Asperges and my sense of danger entirely disappears when I'm drunk, I'm practically a toddler in those moments with childish thoughts and no thought on how I might get hurt or lead astray.

Moments ago I refused to go drinking with one of my friends who is a ""proud"" alcoholic. Explaining to him what happened to me and all he said was ""fair play""... My friends list is almost none existent now as I realize how toxic the people I know are and although each day I feel alone and broken I don't want to spend my life hiding in my apartment looking down the neck of a bottle.

I've took up new hobbies, doing work training, started streaming.. Im doing everything and anything I possibly can to distract me and try to give my life purpose even though I'm now more alone than I ever was in lockdown.

I'm really going to need some luck here..",9

I've been waiting for a psychiatrist appointment since before I got sober.  In the middle of June. Now I won't see one until January.


I specifically stated I wanted to see a doctor, not a psychiatric nurse due to the fact that my last psychiatrist refused to look at my 24 year medical/psychiatric history, and diagnosed me with things that conflict with my previous diagnosis. The next nurse added diagnosis that conflict as well. The medication I was on had awful side effects, and few benefits. I'm 36 and I've put myself through the ringer with my mental illness/personality disorder(?)/alcoholism. I need to know what is wrong with me so I can treat it, and I needed a doctor to answer specific questions I had (I have a notebook!), not just read from the DSM-5. 


I finally got an appointment...with a nurse. I was told due to my insurance I only got one visit for getting a diagnosis a year. So if I talked to the nurse, then I couldn't see an actual MD. 


I decided to wait. Because as desperate as I am for help, I recognize that I need the **right** help. I need my questions answered. So I made an appointment with their psychiatrist and was told I had to wait until December.


I was crushed. I'm white knuckling this, because I don't even have the ability to sit through an entire meeting without losing focus every 5 minutes. I haven't been able to fix my life in any way besides *not drinking* because of my mental illnesses. I want to do the work, and I'm trying but even sitting for 2 minutes in quiet meditation is hard. My house hasn't been cleaned in 2+ years, is full of trash, my yard is overgrown, my dog is matted, my relationship is rocky, and I am suffering. But I'm sober. I know I can fix these things when I'm medicated, I've done it before.


They called in Friday to say they're doubled booked and changed my appointment to January. 


I have a 24 year history of ADHD and in fact my alcoholism didn't really impact my life in major ways until I stopped taking my Adderall. My life is a mess without it. I want to go back on it, but that probably won't even happen because this is a low income program and for some reason even with a long term history with zero abuse, they don't prescribe. And I'm even ok with that, as long as I find something that works even a little bit. I don't want to live this life like this. I can't. It's unsustainable.


I did everything right. And they've failed me over and over. I don't get it, how can some people get rehab & everything paid for on govt assisted insurance, but I've been sober for almost 5 months now and I can't even get a doctor appointment? 


It feels like nobody cares. My sobriety means nothing to the people I'm asking for help. I can't keep doing this alone. I asked for therapy too (bc of the PTSD dx) and the wait is even longer. But it's the medication that is important. I don't know how much longer I have in me. I'm not giving up because of this, but I need this just as much as my sobriety. I am struggling so much every single day. 


I feel like must not deserve any help. Like me being sober doesn't matter, I have no community support. I know I have this Reddit and I'm so thankful. It's the first thing I do when I wake up. I'm just drowning and feel like I have no options. The lady who called me on Friday even suggested I try a GoFundMe so I could see a private psychiatrist. What kind of suggestion is that? I don't have friends or family. Why would strangers give me money? 


I should have gone to the hospital when I quit, but I'm so afraid of hospitals and doctors. My belly was so swollen I couldn't sleep and I couldn't even touch my liver area without wincing in pain. No food stayed down. I was in bad shape physically and mentally, but I also didn't value myself enough to realize I deserved help. But I stopped drinking on my own, and with AA. I need my physical health looked at too, but my priority was my brain, since that's what put me in this position today. I'm so mad at myself for not going to the ER or doctors while wasted. Maybe then I'd have gotten support. Maybe then I'd have my life back by now.


I'm trying to change. I have changed! I want to change more. I want sobriety and my mental health treated. I'm afraid I'll lose my sobriety before I get help. I was going to kill myself or get sober. I got sober. I'm so desperate to be better. What do I have to do to get help? How can doctors and community services just screw me over time and time again? Surely it takes much fewer resources to keep someone sober than to get someone sober! I got the emails of the site director, quality management etc, but it'll be a Herculean task, probably taking days (ADHD), to get that email composed. It won't do anything for me, but maybe will prevent someone else from falling through the cracks in the future. 


I just feel so worthless and helpless. That I have no value to this world since I let alcoholism take over my life. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I am stubbornly sticking to sobriety. I will not drink with you today.",24

Just treated myself to a caramel cookie Nespresso with added caramel sauce b/c it's Sunday and I deserve it!

My sober journey began when I got really anxious and upset with myself after day drinking last Sunday. I put my foot down and told myself I wanted to live the best version of my life that I can, and that does not include alcohol. Between two weeks of work-related anxiety plus drinking Friday, Saturday and Sunday, by Monday morning I had a nasty head cold (anxiety + alcohol = bye bye immune system). I finally seem to be on the other side of the head cold, and I am feeling really good. I am feeling happy. The sleep has been great, I forgot how good sober sleep is. I feel lighter. I am more motivated. I am thinking more clear.

So today involved a birthday brunch with friends and then dinner with my family. This will be the first true test of my will but I am feeling confident. I am going to embrace Shirley Temples again. Maybe I will start posting photos of my Shirley Temple adventures here....

It was a time spent reading a lot of books on alcohol, spending time on this sub and training for a 5k.  I experienced improvements in sleep, in emotional regulation, and a return to some previous interests. I realized how much time/energy I was spending planning to drink and hiding the amount.  I broke my fast by getting drunk :(.  Then going about a month drinking only once a week.  Then 3 weeks of back to square one drinking. Since then I have mostly been not drinking.  I would say my overall ability to not pick up a drink has improved a good deal.  I would say that my ability to moderate has improved to an earlier stage in the progression of my diseased drinking. I think I have had 20 drinks total in the last 6 weeks.   I find that this level of drinking still effects me negatively-/ especially emotionally and my sleep. I am going to do another 30 days of absolute abstinence and honestly that feels like a relief.  My prediction is that I am going to fall into the “I can maybe moderate , but I don’t want to spend so much emotional energy thinking about alcohol all the time” I think the complete sobriety path seems to sometimes lead to just not thinking about alcohol at all.",8

I am feeling so proud of myself, and also quite empowered. It has definitely been a challenge on vacation (see my last post) but here are some things that have helped me:

* Make sure I am well-rested and get at least a full 8 hours of sleep. Prioritizing sleep is a big one for me.
* Make sure to eat! When I sit down in a restaurant and crave a drink, it’s usually because I’m just hungry/hangry. Knowing this about myself helps keep my mind focused on just getting food and not ordering a drink. Once I get some food on the table and into my stomach, my strong hankering for a drink goes away or at least fades far enough into the background that it doesn’t consume me.
* Ask bartenders for a mocktail. Even if no mocktails are on a menu, I’ve never had a bartender turn down that request. I used to think that if there were no mocktails on the menu, it meant they weren’t making them and I was left with only water or soda as my options. Not so! The husband and I went to an amazing raw bar here in Charleston yesterday for lunch. He ordered a Paloma cocktail, and I asked the bartender if he could make me a mocktail. The bartender enthusiastically replied, sure thing! He ended up making me a Paloma sans alcohol, which was actually really delicious! Now that I know how good a Paloma sans alcohol tastes, I can order it again in the future. I think I’m going to slowly build a repertoire of mocktails I like this way!
* Stay focused on what the occasion is actually about and repeat it to yourself. For example, last night the husband and I went to a highly recommended French bistro for dinner, in an old antebellum house in Charleston. It was incredibly romantic, and the type of situation I would absolutely indulge in some wine. I felt almost guilt not, and like I was ruining my husband's experience by refraining as well. But I kept saying to myself – tonight is about delicious French food in a romantic setting with the husband. It is about having an intimate meal with the husband, great conversation, and quality time together. You do not need alcohol to connect with your husband or make the mood more romantic, in fact, it will probably make you sleepy and irritable.
* Play it forward. Whenever I feel like I drink, I think about where it will lead. A short tipsy feeling followed by being tired and irritable, or poor sleep resulting in a bad mood, scattered mind, and anxiety.

The husband just arrived at the cafe I’m working at this morning to join me for breakfast (another major plus is being sober – I actually woke up early and got work done on this vacation – first time ever!) so I’m off. Thanks for being here!",21

Initially it was going so well but temptations are all around and I have now slipped up many times. The last was last night, when going out with my sports society. Drinks mistakenly got sent to our table and since they were essentially ""free"", I had an excuse to take them. It would be shame for them to go to waste! That led onto a long night of drinking, into the early hours. I am now hungover and trying to complete work for my course and I feel ashamed for taking my education for granted.

I drank a lot in my 20s, but was able to make it through school and work through all the hangovers. Now married with two kids and work full time and over the years alcohol has become my crutch. I have to drink every night no matter what. I will moderate at times. Sometimes only one glass of wine. Most nights 2. Then it starts to creep up to 3. I usually don’t have more than 3.  One never feels like enough and I’m always left wanting more. I feel like it’s all I think about is wanting to moderate it. 

Any gray area drinkers out there who have any advice on getting over the fact that we haven’t had a rock bottom? I feel like I keep telling myself I can have a drink here or there, but it’s a slippery slope and I’ll end up back where I’m at. 

Alcohol became my only coping mechanism. I drank when I was bored. Drank when I was happy. Drank to celebrate. Drank to relax. Drank to socialize. Drank when I was angry. Drank when I was sad.

Unfortunately, that is no longer true.

I moved to a different country, renowned for its beer and had already decided , prior to boarding my flight, that it was here that I would try alcohol again. I mean, I had to, right?

The first sip of beer was rubbish, but I kept going. I had another. And then a shot. I felt awful the following day. Swore I wouldn't be doing that again.

Yet a month later, I've said the same thing about five times.

Today I feel awful. I don't know how many times I went back to the shop to buy more ""medicinal"" beer for my crippling flu headache. I remember someone bringing wine and shotting full glasses like it was sambuca. People have seen me drunk. Which is mortifying because I am a completely different, unbearable person why i'm hammered. I don't like people to see me out of control as I'm naturally quiet and reserved.

Has anyone else ever got ""back in the saddle"" after such a spectacular fall from grace? I'm so mad at myself for ruining all those alcohol free days. I'm right back where I started.

It went really well, and my driving instructor was very impressed with my steering and foot work. When he found out how old I was he asked if there was any reason why I have decided to learn now when most people where I live learn as teenagers. 

I shrugged my shoulders and said I never really needed to learn until now. It was just one of those things, you know?

The truth is, I spent my late teens and early twenties drinking myself into a stupor every day - usually starting in the morning until I passes out at night. I never wanted to have access to a vehicle because I couldn't trust myself not to drink and drive. Even when I first went sober I was very apprehensive to get my license in case of a nasty relapse. 

But here I am, 3 years later. Still sober. 

Being able to finally trust yourself is such a good feeling.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Some of you may remember that I’ve thought a lot about my «love your evil twin» thing (I’ve even tattoed it). The versions of you that didn’t end up like you wanted, marked by scars, failures, losses; don’t hate or despise those persons, pour love into them, so they can heal. This has been and still is important in my recovery. Then, a few days ago, u/Hellyeahbrother-87 [shared another perspective](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qqwqpc/thankful_to_the_person_i_used_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on change. She said,

>I used to cringe at who I used to be. I wanted to forget her completely; erase her.

>But then it dawned on me one day that I should be more grateful to her than anyone! The person I was at my absolute lowest, is also the very person who made the decision to change her life completely. And here I am today living that life, and all the amazing blessings it brings.

This really hit home with me. So today, I’m going to love the hurt versions of me (I know one of them just *loves* a good cup of coffee), and be thankful that he had the strenght - the unfathomable courage and strenght! - to change.

I don’t know what it’s like to be you, but I know how it feels to struggle. Know that I am proud of you and I’m right here with you, like others are with me. Feel free to share some self love or gratitude. I will not drink with you today!",272

I have several beers and don't even really feel drunk. On a whim I can walk 2 minutes to the closest convenience store and pick up a 12 pack. I keep getting this urge to drink and sometimes I even end up pouring out half of what I bought because I know I shouldn't drink it but then a few days later I buy another 12 pack.

I thought it was normal. He would always grab a beer out of the eighteen pack that was *always* in the fridge courtesy of my mother getting booze for him as often as he wanted. He'd then spend the rest of the evening drinking on the couch and then either pass out or go to bed. He's the lazy kind of drinker that becomes less and less motivated to do much of anything - including getting his refills - as the binge progresses. He's never been violent, but I've thought less and less of him as he's continued doing this over the years.  I calculated how much he'd have to have spent on beer in the past thirty years not counting tax or inflation - it would be enough to pay for a year of my sister's *out-of-state* college tuition out of pocket. For context, she's in the most expensive program in her school. According to general estimates of the cutoff for alcoholism, he's been drinking more than double the minimum requirement for at least the majority of my childhood. When I turned 21, he was eager to share a beer as if he wanted someone else to make his drinking seem normal. I expressed disgust at the flavor and that was that. Of course, I'd snuck sips of the alcohols in the house before that point, but I didn't like the (usually rather strong) spirits enough for a repeat performance. When I poured out one or two bottles into the sink while they were gone (I was of legal drinking age by this point), I made some lame excuse and they were later having a hushed discussion about it like it was an issue if *I* drank but not if *he* drank himself unconscious. The drinking has continued after *three* heart attacks and knowing full well the men in his family are prone to heart problems. The icing on the cake is that his long term heart medication doesn't play nice with alcohol, but he's still drinking nightly. It wasn't the prospect of dying before sixty that got him to cut back - it was my sister's unimpressed resignation and my disgust at him that kicked off him reducing his intake to 2-3 beers a night. And he's *still* shitting himself! Mumsy always cleans up after him like he's an unhousebroken animal and she *never* brings up that he should stop drinking. If it weren't for her programming job, I'm almost certain we'd have lost the house, but apparently him drinking an accountant's salary isn't cause for concern. I keep bringing up money because these two just can't seem to admit that they're having financial difficulties right now because that idiot won't stop drinking! My other relatives remark (not in bad faith) that it's odd I don't drink at all, but I don't think I could ever take myself seriously if I did after growing up with him. He keeps himself together well enough in public that people that don't live with him wouldn't know he's an alcoholic, but the refusal to quit after three trips to the ER is something I can't respect, addiction or not. My sister and I don't expect him to turn seventy. We don't think he'll ever acknowledge that he has a problem or go to a support group or even try cold turkey. And mother has never stopped enabling - she's always claimed it's to help him 'relax' and that 'he deserves it'. When I commented that he went through beer awfully fast, she got mad and said 'he works hard'. I wanted to say 'he drinks harder'. You'd think she'd want to grow old with him.

tl;dr alcoholic father has never stopped drinking after multiple heart attacks and mother keeps supplying him and refusing to acknowledge there's a problem.",4

Honestly it's a little of a miracle and a whole lot of work. For me working my way through that shame means making friends with forgiving myself. One thing is for sure: you don't forgive yourself just once. You have to do it over and over again. I know I've made progress with forgiving myself and the evidence I think is in my 10 months of sobriety.

Someone recently very nonchalantly said that I was a good woman. Which  to me is such a high compliment and also made me stop in my tracks. I actually laughed when he said it. And I think  I partly laughed because I knew it was true. Then I thought how nuts it was that I was even able to entertain that thought nonetheless agree with it??

I think the only way I was able to experience that feeling is because I continually try to forgive myself. It's the hardest fucking thing but I realized that if I didn't I was just going to keep punishing myself. I also realized that no matter the hurt I endured by the hands others I had done way more damage. And hating myself was exhausting.

However...I did some REAL FUCKED UP SHIT. I try not to dwell on all my jackass behavior although there are days it weighs me down. I figure the only thing I can do to begin to make an amends is to just do better. And to  make a commitment to being truthful with myself. 

But sometimes that shame stings deeeeeep. Maybe the sting is just karmic retribution and it's just something I have to feel.

But if you had asked me last year if I could go 30 days without drinking I would have given a soft maybe. I honestly didn’t think I could and I definitely didn’t want to. 

There is a self-destructive part of me that is saying “ok you’ve proven you’re not an *alcoholic* so you could have a drink.” But I want to remember that the last time I drank I wanted to kill myself for like 16 straight hours. And I also want to remember that “alcoholic” is an outdated term loaded with stigma. I have had an alcohol addiction. People don’t just pick up crack and have a good time. Same with booze. 

I think the biggest piece for me going forward will be loving myself enough to say no. I’ve always been afraid of having good things for myself. I’m definitely happier. A sober life with vision and direction beats the hell out of a drunk one with the clock whirring endlessly around drinking time. 

I got so much praise at the meeting where I picked up my chip. How are some ways you lovely people remember to love yourselves enough to say no?",20

I drank the heaviest on weekends when my SO was at work, towards the end it started bleeding into week days, and my biggest excuse was to relax after a long work week. 

Today I almost immediately started driving to the liquor store after I left work, and even though I went straight home I STILL found myself excited to have alone time to drink. 

I'm not gonna drink, don't even WANT to drink. It's almost like my brain just had a timer set for these thoughts and actions. 

I thought I was over that at this point, am I alone?

Other than that it's been fucking great. I have always been a huge pushover and am standing up for myself more. More confidence, less anxiety, and I'm finally noticing differences in my appearance. Less puffy for sure.
 My favorite thing has been the creative writer and thinker coming back. Thought I lost that part of me in high school. I love horror films and they're scarier without a buzz as well. Also just feeling my emotions all the time has been a fucking thrill.

There was a guy I know there, coming back around, still trying to get a day. He has family who hasn't been speaking much with him for as long as I known him. It eats him up and I get it. I'm just realizing what I forgot to say when I shared.

I've been on both sides of that fence. I had a brother struggling with this disease. The pain of watching a loved one fight and/or fall victim to this struggle is something no one should have to experience. The range of emotions it puts you through is immensely vicious. I'll never forget the complete insanity I felt from the relief of knowing he wasn't going to die along with the pain of imagining him sitting in a jail cell. Hearing him talk about thinking we would all be better off if he just died, sometimes thinking myself that I just wished the misery would end will literally break you heart.

He never found the recovery that I have today. He lost his battle in 2018. I absolutely guarantee you that no matter how steadfast I was with different feelings in the past, the past is the past. There is not, and will not be, a single day I wake up and think the world is a better place without him.

This community has helped me. I went three months without a drink, but that changed on Thursday. I came to a drinking problem later in life. I rarely drank in my twenties and thirties. My late forties are when my problems began. I was a red wine drinker, but I was drinking more, and it was affecting my life and body in negative ways. I would stop sometimes, but then pick up drinking again and seem to get a little worse. I made a list of why I should just quit for good. After three months of not drinking, I knew I made the right decision. I didn’t have to think about alcohol anymore. I was surprised how much head space it had taken up. 

Then a friend just casually mentioned she thought I would like bourbon. She knew I wasn’t drinking anymore, but didn’t know what a problem it was. I had never had bourbon. I wasn’t interested at first, but later I got it in my head that I could sip a little bourbon because wine was my weakness. I thought I would be able to imbibe just a little with bourbon. Two nights in a row I had just a little. Then, on Thursday night, I had just a little, and a little more, and a little more, and a little more. In the morning, I realized that I drank half the bottle. After three months, it really hit me hard. 

When I woke up in the morning, my throat hurt from snoring. I only snore when I’ve been drinking. My face was puffy and blotchy. I had the runs. I had shame. It was scary because, even though I was in my room all night, I knew my memory was fuzzy. I wasn’t in control the night before. I had to get ready for work. I could tell my brain wasn’t sharp. I was probably still drunk, which brought more shame. Before I left, I got on my laptop just to check the headlines. The page left open was for shopping. I had a sinking feeling when I realized I had done some online shopping. (I will be returning some packages when they come.) Not to be dramatic, but I felt traumatized from how bad everything was the next day.

This is a note to future me when I think about having one drink:

You have lost your ability to moderate. Your brain is happy sober. Your brain is happy drunk. Your brain is not happy with just one drink. It cannot handle just one drink. It will lure you to another, and another, and another…. If you take that first drink, know that you WILL get drunk. Your days of being able to have just one are over. Accept that and move on. Do not go back to the anxiety, waking up at 2:30 in the middle of the night, peeing in the middle of the night, headaches, dry mouth, feeling unwell, having blotchy skin, high blood pressure, and experiencing fear from knowing you weren’t in control the night before. Accept it and move on. Your life is better without alcohol. Embrace the freedom of being alcohol-free.

I was at 307 days until yesterday. Those 307 days were amazing, however as time went on I slowly could see that I was wanting to drink. Little, small thoughts saying “that beer looks nice”.

Since becoming sober, there have been plenty positives - however there are negatives too for me.

One of these negatives is my social life with my partner. I can see that it saddens her that we can’t go out for a drink together with friends or by ourselves. She loves me and is my number 1 supporter, however I can see it still affects her.

I’ve just moved to a new town, and yesterday I made the conscious decision to drink alcohol. I just felt like it was the only way I was going to be able to bond with the new people I’d met, as they like to drink too.

When I told my partner, she was happy - she was excited to be able to share a drink with me and meet new people. She said that she misses me when I’m drunk, because when I’m drunk I’m more affectionate and sociable compared to when I’m sober.

We had a decent night, and now I’ve woken up full of regret. I feel so disappointed in myself for breaking my sober streak. Nothing bad happened yet I still ended up crying today because of the sadness and anxiety I felt.

My previous opera outings included hoisting glasses of Champagne or some other libation, before/during/after the performance. 

When I rejoined my friend, she was at a table with two tall flutes of mimosas, one for me.  Ugh.  I kept my cool, though...I said, ""We got so rushed trying to get here, I didn't have a chance to tell you that I'm still not drinking.""  She apologized, I said no need.   I got myself a glass of water, she drank her mimosa, and when the bell rang to remind us Act II was about to start, we left the other mimosa untouched on the pretty little bar table.

This week is more like “suck it up Sunday” for me! I need to get my ass in gear. I have slacked like crazy these last few weeks, I have a long list of excuses- but none of them reason enough to continue down this path of putting things off. It’s kind of crazy because I still keep losing weight consistently, but I lack energy and focus when I get off my grind. What better way to hold myself accountable, than to put it out there for you all? This is where we do just that- Shape Up Sunday is a place to talk about your wellness/fitness/diet successes, set your intentions for the week, and leave your challenges in the past.

I think I value the energy I get from being healthy way more than I care about the scale. I think that shift really clicked with sobriety. I keep thinking “ok if I can convince myself to not drink, I can convince myself to not eat this or not eat that” and “if I have the discipline to not drink for over a year, I can discipline myself to make better choices for today” I think all of these changes all boil down to that part of my brain that focuses on self-control. So I’m going to keep honing in on that thought process and see where it gets me! 

Maybe today is your first day sober, or your 1000th day sober… I think my favorite part about this sub is how we are all in such different places sobriety wise, but we are all connected by our common goals. I like to think the Shape Up Sunday crew is the same in that way- we want the same things, we sometimes take different paths to get there!



How are you all doing? How are you sticking to your goals? How can we help you get back on track? I really appreciate you all being candid and bringing so much useful information to the table every week. Looking forward to hearing from you all- have a great Sunday and an even better week!",39

He then made a really sad face, and I asked what was wrong. He said I like it better when you don’t drink. 
Then, for about 5 hours for the rest of the evening I screamed at him and fought with him in front of our kids and said horrible nasty things and blamed him for embarrassing me and stating a nasty unwanted opinion. I told him I’m sorry he didn’t like me drinking, but maybe if I was happier I wouldn’t have to drink. My son then quietly asked if we were getting a divorce. 
Then I kept drinking and he put them to sleep, I watched the show we were watching without him loudly in vein.
I realized I was so angry because it’s so hard for me to quit, and to hear him say he didn’t like it either put so much pressure on me- I’m scared I can’t do it. I was almost mad he didn’t understand how hard it was. It made it more real and it’s hard for me to let go of drinking. I completely villainized him for hours and believed myself.

But the 2nd one....thats where it hits me. I quit on a thursday. This is my 2nd weekend. My first trial was grocery shopping. I wanted yogurt. The yogurt is right next to the alcohol. But I did it! I stayed strong. I got my yogurt, I picked up some cinnamon rolls for my victory of a week (they were delicious), and I checked out after grabbing a couple more things I needed for the week. Success.


My second trial came on the way home. You see, the store is right next to a liquor store. But I avoided looking at it and said ""this is all the shopping we are doing for the week"" and kept driving. Success.


But now, at 9 30 pm, Ive hit my 3rd trial. Im so bored. Im playing skyrim and will probably sleep soon, but generally my weekend is spent video gamin while inebriated and staying up till 2am because normally Im at work till 12 30 in the morning so 2 am is a normal sleep time for me. A part of me wants so badly to go back to the store, grab some alcohol, and party hard by myself till I pass out. But I know its nowhete near as fun as the voice inside me says it will be.


Im gonna stay strong. Just need to hold tight until 11 pm. At 11 pm all the stores close for the night and then Im in the clear. I physically couldnt get anything no matter how bad Im craving after that point. Boredom is such a bad trigger for me. I hope in the future it gets less and less triggering.

2021-11-13 19:00:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qtde7m/day_one_again_a_year_later/,"Day one, again, a year later.","I quit the 10th of November, last year. Quit for 72 days. My roommate did, too. But, eventually, he wanted to drink again. And, well, I have shit will power and had the same old conversation with myself that I’m sure many of you have had: you did great, you managed your drinking, it’s a fresh start, it’ll be better this time since you made it so far. It’s really only gotten worse. I’ve gained 20lbs since then. I’m sicker physically than I ever have been. Worst shape of my life. I did some real dumb things, upset some people (including close friends), made others worry. Drunk me is an ass, doesn’t use his brain, and finds ways to get into trouble. He hangs out with people sober me would HATE. It’s like he’s TRYING to embarrass me. I wake up and have the same shit I see all over here: anxiety attack, heart pounding, it’s 3am and I can’t fall back asleep. I try to recollect what I said and did, and my texts are more nauseating than the last tequila shot. It’s embarrassing. Why do people put up with drunk me?   


I’ve made mistakes and it’s tough to forgive myself. Thankfully I’m good at apologizing so others tend to forgive me fairly easily. I admit my mistakes without hesitation. But, ultimately, saying sorry gets old for everyone involved. It’s exhausting to hear it over and over again I’m sure.  


I’m a binge drinker. Because of this, people don’t think I’m an alcoholic, I guess because I don’t drink every day. I hate the word alcoholic, always have. It’s too exclusive. I have a problem with alcohol, I have alcohol use disorder, I have a substance abuse problem. I think those are better ways of saying it, it tends to make people take it more seriously when I explain that I have a problem. And what’s fucked up is, it’s not a problem when it’s not happening. I function, I work hard, I sleep, I have good relationships, I’m doing well in school. But when a get together falls on a night before my class, I’ll probably miss class. I know better than to do ANYTHING the night before work, thankfully. I don’t miss work. But I can’t say no on a night when I don't work, because I won’t get that fucked up, you know? I’ll buy a six pack and I’ll drink that. And when that’s gone I’ll be done, I’ll just …well, whatever, it’s fine to have a few more, I’ll just go to bed early and take ibuprofen and chug water….oh… It’s midnight? Whatever I’ll just sleep in and deal with the fallout. Spoiler, the next day fallout is a shitshow. I don’t deal with it. And when the next party happens and I’ve had enough time to forget how awful it is and what dumb shit I did, I repeat the whole process.  


My fiancé is the best, she’s super supportive and has always had my back through thick and thin. I owe a lot to her. She agrees I should stop drinking. It never adds, only detracts. And my sister, she’s worried sick about me, and we have other shit we should be worrying about. The rest of the family is fucked up and the whole thing is a mess, I don’t need to worry her. Besides, a good friend died from booze. Killed himself. My fiancés father is drowning himself in Evan Williams. A fifth a day type of guy, first pass out is at 11AM type of guy. I don’t want my fiancé to lose her dad to this and me too. I don’t want to worry people anymore. I don’t want to wonder if I’m going to end up the same way as my friend.  


So, day one. Again, and again, and again.",15

Just regular old fashioned, close eyes, open eyes again and have it be 8 hours later. Compared to last week, that form of time traveling is ***vastly*** superior to blacking out.

Granted, I didn't do anything physically productive with that energy, but it was great to wake up clear minded, rested, refreshed, and was able to focus on the things I normally do like language studying, stream planning, etc.

This (third attempt) at a first week was a great reminder of how good it feels to not be tied down by the effects of alcohol.

I quit alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes all at the same time. I'm still using nicotine patches and gum, but I'm down to the lowest dose and slowing down on the gum too.

I gave up my resistance to AA. Even though I'd had bad experiences with it in the past I decided I needed the structure it had provided. I did the 90&90 - 90 meetings in 90 days, and got a sponsor. Not every meeting/ every person in the program is great but they have all helped me in some way and I honestly don't think I could have done it without that support system. I'm still working my way up to step 4. 

I haven't posted on this sub in a long time. But I still check it every few days - especially when the cravings are strong. When I need the carrot, there are stories of people's achievements and progress. You show me where I want to go. When I need the stick, there are stories of people's struggles and regrets. You show me where I've been and where I don't want to go back to. Every post helps. These reminders and pieces of advice are in my pocket at all times, another support I couldn't have gotten here without. 

There are still improvements I want to make. My energy levels and motivation are not always where I want them to be. I've gained weight from indulging in sugary snacks. I still haven't gotten a job, and that plus my unfinished step work nags at me. But I wouldn't trade where I am for the world. There's no going forward without being here. And there's no success if I go back. 

I don't have to lie anymore. I don't have to hide what I'm doing. I can look myself in the mirror, I can be proud of myself again. The guilt and shame and constant anxiety have lifted. Even the challenges ahead seem doable. I love others and myself more freely. Instead of just a shell, I feel like I'm a real human being.

So, as everyone here knows admission and acceptance that you have a problem is the first, and usually the hardest part.. Followed by the actual sobriety, and then the sticking with sobriety when shit gets rough part and so on. finding something better to do with your time, appreciating the little things, getting right with God, and your loved ones. All that good stuff that seemed impossible before you got sober.

Okay, now we all also know that replacing a habit with another habit is never the right answer. You don't go from having to drink a fifth of whiskey to get through the day, to popping Dr. Feelgood's magic back pain pills like skittles and expect to be seen as a Saint. That ain't how shit works.

So besides the obvious  ""I just smoke pot"" or ""ambian is better than a night cap"" or the ever so lovely ""I don't need alcohol anymore, I have Jesus"" responses.

When you got sober, what did you do instead of drinking?

For me, getting to drop by the liquor store on my way home from work, getting in the door and pouring my first drink was always my ""special treat"" for the day. Didn't matter if it was a great day, or a terrible day, always had to have a drink after the day was over.

I know that when you first give it up, your body CRAVES sugar. We've all been there.

But two things that have stuck with me through my journey into sobriety, a nice cold Diet Dr. Pepper when I want something to sip on. And a big 'ol bowl of ice cream before bed instead of one last stiff drink.

So, tell me. What's your new ""go to"" instead of the bottle? Maybe we can all work together and give some of the people who are sober curious, lurking, and/or too afraid to give it up yet some ideas on how to slowly get themselves away from the brown bottle of doom. Lol",27

I'm hoping for a more productive day today.

This is the longest I've been sober in a while! The start of the pandemic was a tipping point for my drinking problem. I was so anxious, I just started drinking almost every day and (usually at least 3-8 standard drinks). I'm stopping for health. Since stopping my anxiety has been really bad! I talked to my doctor and she's getting me in to see a telehealth psychiatrist soon.

I'm on the fence about AA and 12 Stepping. I've been to a few meetings in the past and I even got a sponsor who I haven't spoken to in months. She is an amazing lady. I was told to find a sponsor who I look up to and who has achieved things in their recovery that I want to achieve. This lady is a mother of adult children and her family means the world to her.

So I’m 82 days sober. I run a bar. The temptation is there every day. I fight it and I continue to be successful.

We closed last night at 11pm and fifteen minutes later I hear knocking on our front window. It’s one of the owners.

Our restaurant is a pub for a larger brewery, we are one of several restaurants. We also are a decently large local distributor. So I don’t see the owners often but I’ve known them for a long time.

He comes in, drunk as a skunk, and asks if I would pour him a bourbon. He cuts my paycheck and we weren’t quite done cleaning so I said sure.

Eventually the bartender leaves and it’s me, one of my cooks, and the owner. We had an awkward conversation, where he came across as very pompous. He also drunkenly disclosed information about an upcoming renovation planned for the winter that our staff was not to be informed of till several weeks from now.

During the conversation he brings up the fact that one of the other owners told him I had stopped drinking. He applauded me for my success but drunkenly went on to describe how “I’m like a completely different creature” and “that before I looked all cracked out”. 

I don’t know, I know it was sort of a compliment because it means my stopping drinking is working. But I can’t help but feel offended for the way he was talking about me in front of my employee. 

Anyways. That’s all I got. Not drinking still but frustrated.",43

I don’t want this post to come off the wrong way..

But are there any subreddits that make not drinking a fun challenge with memes and shit posts and stuff? Thinking of like the sobriety version of r/hydrohomies or r/nonutnovember. 

Believe a different mental approach to sobriety, turning it into like a game or challenge, could be helpful for many who recognize they probably drink more than they should. Essentially the people who would take the Annie Grace 30 day challenge.

Has anyone seen something like this? If not do you guys think one should be created? Thanks!

Sober October? Hated it, I managed 3 days.

Detox diets; hated it, always put on weight due to all the sweet cravings. (Who knew you wanted sweets when you stop drinking?!)

I knew what I could lose before. My husband tried for years to stop me. Or that's what he calls the silent treatment and anger. But no one chooses to marry an alcoholic, he tried his best.

So why has this time stuck? I revel in my sobriety, find peace in it. After something I risked everything to avoid, why is it now just a way of life? Why can I now buy the brandy my husband asked for and not see it as an excuse to buy wine for me? 

Any thoughts or meanderings on why you quit this time, and why it's sticking would be appreciated. At some point I won't feel this resolute, and I think power is knowledge. If I know how I quit. Maybe I can stay quit.

While I ""only"" drink beer, the past 3 years or so I've become highly dependent on it. Every night after work I'd have at least 3 beers, sometimes finishing off a 6 pack. It was the only way I could unwind. Most of my days off were spent day drinking in the late morning early afternoon till I passed out and woke up later in the evening. I wouldn't make plans specifically so I could do that.

I should also mention, I take prescription medication that causes drowsiness/ amplifies the effect when mixed with alcohol. That, along with the fact that I almost always drink on an empty stomach, made those few beers a day go a long way.

Anyways, over the past couple months I've had two sobriety stints lasting 1-2 weeks each. It was great, I felt noticeably better physically and mentally. I did feel more depressed/anxious some days, but I knew that was normal and honestly it was just nice to feel emotions and face them instead of numbing them out with alcohol. I did continue to smoke weed, so I wasn't ""100% sober"", but the improvements were noticeable and I knew I was going in the right direction.

With all that being said, both of those stints ended. It wasn't because I was feeling depressed or had a bad day at work. It was the opposite. Both times I had a great day and came home with free time and a whole lot of energy. I felt great, but it was overwhelming in a way. Both times I convinced myself to go buy beer. ""Just today"", ""I earned this"", ""I'm bored"", ""what else am I gonna do"". All just excuses.

Today is another day one, I'm trying not to get discouraged by my relapses and instead focus on the time I was sober and remind myself that alcohol is not my friend and im better off without it in every way.",15

I’m feeling great today at work.  No delusions or intrusive thoughts.  I also slept great last night.  I had to start yet another program for my job called hpsp.  It’s for nurses who have substance abuse and mental health issues.  It is going to be a lot but mostly they just do urinary analysis.  I thought after this six month treatment was over that I would be done with UAs but the HPSP program makes me do it for up to three years.  Plus my nursing license is on the line.  It makes me a bit nervous but I welcome the accountability.   That’s all I’m having a great day at work.  I hope everyone else is doing well

What's been really hard for me to shake is the notion that my evenings were somehow spoken for.  I have a really hard time just living my life during the hours that used to be devoted to, say, pouring myself too many glasses of wine and watching Netflix or playing games.  Every now and then, I get into a slump, in which my non-working hours become like everything I did when I was drinking, but without the booze, and it's not great.  It's not as bad as it was but it's dreary and futile and I feel like I'm pissing my life away.  It's not that it's bad to waste time, or like I need to use every minute to accomplish something - that's not what I'm getting at.  It's that, it's not living, it's like being comatose.  It's like being drunk.  Zoned out, I'm barely even showing up for these hours of my life.

It's better than it used to be: I used to feel like I couldn't drive after work, because I'd surely be drinking.  It took rather a long time for me to be able to just pop into the car and go somewhere after work.  These habits - they've reduced me to a trapped little mouse.  Now the walls are gone but I still act like they're there.

So I’ve been a somewhat heavy drinker for a while - even if its just 1-3 times a week, the amount is high. It’s mainly out of a mix of boredom, trauma, and a heavy exhaustion that’s been present for years. 

I recently got an alcohol/drug test for work - and apparently my liver function is shit, and I’m flagged with ‘high alcohol consumption’ now. It’s humiliating. (For the record - never been drunk, hungover, anything at work, but I feel like my boss has acted differently towards me since.)

I’m finally getting more thorough liver function tests, blood work and thyroid tests done to figure out the exhaustion. I also just - don’t want to drink anymore. I want to have energy for my life and not feel dependent on alcohol to carry me through being tired but wanting to do stuff/be social. I get so bored, and no energy to really do anything. And I know eventually again I’ll be bored as shit, exhausted, and drinking will just be an easy way to not think.

What motivated you to stay sober? What positive effects have you seen? Any tips, for when I feel like drinking again? Anything for me to try to keep in mind?

I think my biggest fear is whether my liver is damaged, and how much damage alcohol is causing my body (if you have info on how it damages your body/the physical recovery timeline, feel free to post). I know it’s literal poison, but I guess I didn’t fully get that until I got those results back at work. I’d just like to see finally, over a longer period, what consistent sobriety feels like.",19

And I almost gave in. Twice.

The husband and I arrived in Charleston yesterday for a long weekend. We’ve had this trip booked for a while and I’ve been really looking forward to it. But, I’ve never gone on a trip and not drank. So I knew this was going to be a challenge and a big test for me. Especially since I’m only 6 days into my sobriety journey.

I’ve told my husband I want to quit drinking…but I’ve also told him that countless other times as well. The truth is, he just doesn’t get it. I don’t think most people in my life would. The problem is that I can control my drinking maybe 60% of the time. I can have two glasses of wine and stop. But the other times I keep going, maybe not having so much that I’m acting like a drunken fool (done that plenty of times though) but enough where I’m waking up at 3 am, sweating, filled with anxiety, and it carries into the next day and starts a cycle. Don’t get me wrong – there are also a handful of times where I drink so much I blackout, like my sister’s engagement party a few weeks ago. But those instances are few and far between and I think most people in my life, including my husband, just see those as the odds times where I overdo it. They don’t really understand what I go through on a more regular basis involving drinking. I’ve tried to explain it to my husband and he knows drinking causes me to have a bad sleep, but I think that’s where it ends for him. He doesn’t get it. He can’t see what goes on inside my mind, how awful it makes me feel physically and mentally, and how that puts me in a cycle of wanting to drink again the next day just to feel better, which leads to days of feeling worse and worse.

Anyways, I could go on and on about this but the truth is, my husband is so incredibly loving and supportive but he’s not about to tie my hands behind my back to make sure I don’t drink. So I knew staying sober on this vacation would be up to me.

We woke up at 3 am yesterday to catch our flight. Everything went smoothly until we arrived in Charleston and had trouble getting our rental car. It was half an hour of some back and forth and it was stressful – I was impatient and pissed off. When we finally got it sorted we drove straight to the beach for lunch and all I could think about was how nice a cold glass of wine or beer would be to bring down my nerves and relax me. I knew it wouldn’t be just one though, it would be at least two if I was *really* good (probably more like 3 because it’s vacation!), and then I would be tired all afternoon, not fully enjoying or present on our beach walk, angry at myself for caving so soon, and then end up drinking again later in the evening. But playing it forward like that didn’t work. I actually told my husband I was going to order a margarita, and he was trying to flag down the bartender for me when our food arrived. I started eating and suddenly didn’t want the drink anymore! I told my husband not to worry about it. I was starving and the food was *so good*, it satisfied me and made me happy and I didn’t even think about having a drink anymore.

Then a similar thing happened at dinner. The restaurant we planned on going to had a 3-hour wait! And we had no reservation anywhere else. I was pretty tired by this point (having been up since 3 am), starving, and again stressed and pissed off we didn’t have somewhere to eat. We ended up at this cute little wine bar that had charcuteries – good enough for us – but also, obviously, tons of wine. I ordered a 3-ounce glass of red wine and just felt on edge and not good about it but also like I needed it. There was a battle raging inside me as I tried to have a normal conversation with my husband. I actually took two small sips over the span of a few minutes and then our food arrived. I started eating, my hangry attitude went away, and then I gave the wine to my husband. I didn’t want it anymore after my hunger was satisfied! So yes, technically I did drink last night but it was two very small sips, spaced well apart. No more than the sip you would take of the wine at church, so I’m not counting it.

My husband happily finished my glass of wine, we got dessert, had a great conversation, and I went to bed sober and proud of myself. I slept for 10 hours and feel good about today. I know I have to stay vigilant the rest of the trip if I’m going to make it my first sober one. But I have two things going into today that I didn’t have yesterday – I’m well-rested, and I know a big trigger for me is just hunger. So with that in mind, I’m going into today all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to have a great day exploring Charleston with my husband, eating amazing food, and not drinking!

Yesterday had some ""triggers"" maybe you could say. After work walked and biked past a place I would have in the past often stop and grab a beer, then probably another, and then who knows what happens. Then biked through a downtown area with lots of drinking places, actually was on a street that would have been part of my routine. I could feel it inside, that pull that normally I would succumb to. I was actually on a way to meet a friend for coffee whose father had recently passed away. Made it and was great.

Biked home, only to find out I had a dripping leak coming through my bathroom ceiling. Still leaking this early morning, but I let the maintenance person know and he should be over sometime today. Thought about what it would be like to down a ""sixer"" at home last night as I was worked up. Didn't happen, but played in my head what that would be like, just thinking about how I would ""not deal"" in so many ways (proud of dealing with it better and sober.) Instead I woke up to three weeks of not drinking. I sense I will be getting these pulls, I will stir up past emotions that have been tied to my drinking behavior. I suppose it is all part of it, just have to deal with it. Very much want to stay on this journey, I am a better person this way.",35

I’m glad he reached out. We got dinner. 

While waiting for our table he casually let me know that he’s got a lot of drinks in his hotel if I wanted to take them — he didn’t want them to go to waste. For the first time I could say with ease  “thanks man, but I don’t drink anymore.” I could sense his hesitancy with what to say next, so I added - “i just don’t have the energy anymore haha.” Ain’t that the truth.

48 days ago…before I turned myself around, I was waking up daily at 2 am needing a sip to calm my nerves, sweats, and shaking. I’d start my day vomiting, praying it wouldn’t be blood. I’d quiet my stomach with antacids and more alcohol. I was rotting inside.

For some context, as recently as a few months ago I would walk to this gas station which is about a block away from my apartment complex. This was a walk of annoyance: I would end up walking there if I had polished off the wine or champagne (easier on my system for some reason) I had purchased earlier. Earlier typically meant a hazy in-between: enough in my system not to feel onset of something sinister but not quite lit enough to go about my day. This period is also known as the ""obligatory visit to the closest wine aisle."" On a related note: $50-$60 per day adds up unbelievably quickly - $1500/$2000 a month? Now that I'm not soaked all the time I can visualize how I could better spend that money. But anyway:

It wasn't so great because the gas station's selection is quite horrible - if you ever drank a few bottles of apothic red back to back you know what I'm talking about. That ""cabernet"" tastes like... well, let's just say I got really good at not breathing through my nose / breathing techniques to suppress nausea while partaking.

Lately, I've been having late-night cravings for snickers and a variety of candy which is what I ended up purchasing. Still, there I was at this place but on an entirely different mission. I looked at the wine bottles. It was very strange. I very much still crave the romantic idea of a pricy steak + pricy red wine combo. Always been a treat,  sounds great. But looking at that shelf, there's no denying that all that it contains is gnarly.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that before, alcohol was alcohol. Now, even though I still would like some, I'm starting to get... more picky. Here's to hoping I get so picky after a while that I end up refusing the ""nice"" wine.

I've been ghosted by this week's Saturday Share volunteer.  That's two weeks in a row.  I just feel sad.  A few weeks back, I had two people so over the moon about sobriety they wanted to shout it from the rooftops.  And then they went AWOL.

Once again, if you'd like to volunteer to be a featured Saturday Share, send me a message.  Instructions are here: https://soberingthought.github.io/saturday_share/

I'm getting worried this is becoming SoberingThought Saturday.

So, for this week, it's up to the rest of us to do some Saturday Sharin'.  How's about we all share one of our favorite moments from sobriety.  Not like ""how each morning I wake up without a hangover"".  We did that kind last week.

I'm talking about a beautiful, singular moment where you were just like ""wow, thanks sobriety"".

I have _a million_.  But this week, I had _two_ that I just love.

It's 9:30pm.  My wife, recovering from foot surgery, has long since gone to bed.  I have two little boys sleeping in their beds.  The house is all to myself.  This is _exactly_ the kind of night I lived for when I was drinking.  No one awake.  No witnesses.  I'd be swilling warm vodka straight from the handle!

But tonight I'm not drinking.  But I am still sneaking around.  I have a flashlight and a some money in my hands.  I slowly ease into a bedroom, approach my target, and slide my hand ever so gently under his pillow.  I feel around for something hard, like a pebble.  I gently ease it out from under the pillow and slip the money in its place.  I sneak back out of the room and turn the flashlight onto my prize: a tiny little tooth.  It is 9:30pm and I'm a stone-cold sober tooth fairy.

In fact, I got to be the tooth fairy _twice_ this week!  My youngest son lost his first, then second tooth within a few days of each other.  I was sober and present for the entire affair and it was fantastic to see how genuinely excited he was about the whole thing.  And the next morning, when he woke up and found the money!  You'd think he won the lottery!  I sure felt like I had!

There is _nothing_ I treasure more than being a sober father and these kinds of events really bring that home to me.

I invite you, on this wonderful Saturday, to share one of _your_ favorite memories in sobriety.

Our first appointment, so she was mostly getting my history. When we got to recovery supports, I explained that none of my friends know I'm in recovery or getting mental health treatment. I do attend AA, but I'm the youngest in my group by decades and have been having issues with my sponsor who previously has been a great support. As in, she's displayed some very questionable behavior lately (as confirmed through discussions with others, not just my own feelings.) I feel really grateful to this community, that I can come on here and feel connected to strangers worldwide fighting the same disease. Just wish I had more in-person people in my life who I could share in my recovery journey. When I shared some of this with the CRS, she teared up and told me it must be really hard to do this without my family or friends knowing. I guess I've pushed that feeling down because I realize for me (and all of us) sobriety is life or death so I power through, but it can be really, really hard. Thanks for listening and IWNDWYT ❤️",13

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sober Saturday! I am so glad you’re here. Thank you one and all for being here and being awesome as we circle around the sun.  This week you have filled this feed with beauty and rocking insights – you’ve made me snort with laughter and moved me to tears and I am incredibly grateful.  

Recently I read that:   In order to carry a positive action, we must develop here a positive vision.

At the time, I kind of thought, OK, some day.

Now that I’m past the first months in the trenches, it’s time for positive vision.  And today mine needs to include play.  Play outdoors, play with my dog, play with my hubs, creative play where there is no “wrong”, play including dancing around my kitchen with AC/DC blaring (though that may scare my pup). Just play for the sake of finding joy.  

So, today I’m making a list of ways to play and committing to “playing” every day for at least 15 minutes.

For years, play was missing from my life.  Funny how all those commercials showing folks laughing while they drink, weren’t the reality I found in a bottle on the regular.  It just didn’t feel good and I’m so grateful to know that all the way to my core.

Every tomorrow is determined by every today.  

So why don’t we, just for today, apply these sentiments to play and laughter and joy.  We have this day, this beautiful gift of a day.  Let’s enjoy our time engaging with one another and out in the world – at play!  IWNDWYT",183

Sober since 11/1. I never realized how much I was using alcohol to cope with depression until it was gone. I’ve struggled with depression my whole life but the last few days have been the worst I’ve ever experienced, I’ve been sobbing uncontrollably, unable to do anything or go anywhere and having suicidal thoughts.

I got a hold of a crisis counselor and got a prescription today that should start to help within a couple of weeks. I could really use some words of encouragement or advice from others who have had to cope with severe depression without alcohol.

It feels so bad that I keep thinking I should just drink to stop feeling this. I am trying to stay sober but damn is it difficult today.",6

Obviously things like meditation, journaling, and AA are talked about a lot but I am curious to hear people's specific journeys to ""do the work"" to fix their relationship with their lives. 

If you went to therapy, what did you talk about? 
If you journaled, what would you write about? 
If you meditated, what effects did you notice and why? 

What tangible changes did you make to your life (aside from not drinking) and how do you feel about those changes looking back now on your progress? (Bragging encouraged if you've made a ton of progress, or have made a small change that used to feel impossible!)

I decided to have some champagne with my friends earlier this month; I was curious to see if it would trigger cravings, and it didn’t. Even still, I found that I didn’t enjoy drinking, didn’t enjoy the buzz. This was new for me.

I’m back to ten days now, and I’ve finally had my first day of serious cravings. Not drinking has allowed my psychotropic meds to actually work properly, so I’ve been living in this clarified mental state free from depression. I knew it wouldn’t last forever, and today was the day I felt it creep up again.

It wasn’t horrible, but I shirked all my responsibilities today and couldn’t bring myself to leave my warm bed. Eventually I felt bad about wasting the day and thought, fuck it, if it’s already a bust why don’t I just go drink. I tried to come up with lies I could tell my roommate to leave the apartment, tried to think about where I’d go, and then I thought about actually taking that first sip, being drunk, and I didn’t want to so badly anymore.

Still, I felt bad. I bought myself a greasy burger for dinner, watched an episode of my show of the moment, and called my mom and my best friend. I’m thinking of the work I have to do tomorrow and how much easier it’ll be without a hangover. Things aren’t perfect, they never will be; actually, things are guaranteed to be much worse at some point in the future. But I made the decision not to drink today. I can keep making that decision for as long as I want.

Just wanted to share this little victory.",20

This place rocks!! 👍🏼🙂,"2 months ago I was yet again going into hospital for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, I felt horrible, it took alot of energy to make the walk there, I actually had to drink 1 litre of wine just to make myself feel better, so I could function. I was halusinating and was very dizzy, I was very dehydrated and so depressed.
I walked into the emergency room and confessed that I had been drinking over 80 drinks a day for 2 weeks straight. I looked like I was dying to be honest, I remember looking into my eyes in the mirror before leaving home to the hospital 10 min walk away. (Lucky I live close by) then the doctor saw me start away, the emergency room had about 20 people waiting they took me straight in. I got the help and medication to detox safely at home after they took my bloods, gave me IV fluids, diazepam electorates, and thaimin through the drip. The first week was so hard, the second week was a kitty easier, after 1 month I felt better, but I can say today I feel so much better mentally and physically, I got a new job in the first month, I have payed my rent on time, I always have food to eat in the fridge. I'm looking better, I've lost 4 kg. The list goes on.
This place was a God send for me, I have been logging in every day to read and pledge my IWNDWYT in the daily check in. I also have had some counciling on the outside of this wonderful community.
I love you all, and for anyone who is on day one or struggling to make it even a week. Keep on keeping on, don't beat yourself up like I was after I relapsed. Just get back up on your feet and seek as much support as possible, especially here, all it takes is a post and some encouragement to get through that little or huge craving.
The other things I did to get me through the first weeks was going for walks along the water, keeping my eyes and mind on the positives that NOT drinking poison will do for me, and the negatives that drinking poison. The negatives are always so much worse off than the positives my list.
Podcasts, reading story's of recover, YouTube videos on sobriety.

Hear me out..","So, I noticed something the other day. I was craving a drink and because of my living situation. I would have to sneak somehow to get it. But I was also starving. Hadn't eaten all day. I decided to eat real quick while I plotted. All of a sudden my craving almost disappeared. After thinking about it I believe I know why. 
When I used to drink. I would purposely starve myself because I felt like the alcohol hit better, got me drunk faster, more euphoria etc. I think I created a Pavlov's dog kind of brain connection. So every time I was hungry, it was time to drink.
Now, devils advocate. This may just be a correlation not causation. Meaning the time I spent eating allowed for the craving to pass.
I thought this might help some people here. Obviously not at all meant to hurt anyone struggling with any eating disorder. This just happens to be something that worked for me and I'm exploring this trigger now by trying to eat when I crave a drink.

some good days, some bad days, but I'm not drinking. 

that's about it. 

still waiting for that ""light switch"" to go on and move forward with life, but easier said than done. my mom died in June, lost a brother from another mother due to a falling out, same with another long term platonic lady friend, broke up with the love of the last decade (she wanted to move back to cali, and I needed to stay for work). 

I keep telling myself that tomorrow is the day where I start my new life, and life has a way of serving up not so awesome stuff, to say the least.
what I'm grateful for?

this community, what friends I do have, a good paying job that I like and am good at, a great deal with a major record label that is a big door opening for a career I've worked at for a long time.

still so many days I have a hard time leaving the house. this past weekend I slept the entire time and was just at a malaise. 

can I say I'm happy? absolutely not, and if I was I'd be deluding myself. I know sometimes it's okay to not be okay, but it's more often than not. went to therapy and they told me to slow down, take some time to reflect. well my work promoted me (more or less forced to take the role or leave the company), so had to cancel plans to see my dad out of state, twice in the last few months. I vowed to spend more time with family, but life literally pulled me in another direction. sure, I could leave, but it's the first good job I've had in 10 years. when several therapists, and successful friends you can confide in can't give any crumbs of comfort you just grind through it I suppose.

anytime I get some genuine optimism about things, life has a funny way of ""testing"" you, seemingly at the worst times.

It was not just the alcohol that was making me tired. You can just be tired. Take a relaxing shower. Get some comfortable clothes on. Take some melatonin. Read a book in bed and chill the heck out before getting some unbelievably deep sleep. That’s the plan for me tonight, anyway. Years ago I would have thought that to be a waste of time.

Had a few NA beers, no real temptation to drink or cravings, but I must say, it was pretty boring overall. Could barely hear anyone talking over all the noise, difficult to engage in conversations. Towards the end of the night one of my very drunk friends told me the same story three times in a row, slurring their words and mumbling...

Regardless of the not drinking, still woke up with a bit of a headache today, might have been the NA beers, might just be the continued withdrawal symptoms

Now it's on to the weekend. Plans have fallen through thanks to the weather (was supposed to be playing baseball today, first game since lockdown ended, thanks rain...) and I really have nothing planned for the next two days. Normally in a situation like this it'd be a case of beer or a bottle of liquor and some TV or video games.

Not this time, I'll have to figure something else out. Any recommendations on how to fill my days? Preferably cheap options, as times are a bit lean at the moment.

I kept it simple and to the point. Not overly sentimental. I stated I wasn’t asking for “forgiveness” and she didn’t even need to reply if she didn’t want to. 

Writing it brought me back to that place of guilt and shame, which I can easily dwell in. Even though it was a small action, I’m glad I did it. And in a way that negative experience holds less power over me. It’s not “renting space” in my head as much anymore.

If I compare the pros and cons of my not drinking, I would be a fool to go back to it. 

But. 

Does anyone else ever feel like they’re not “done”? Sorry if this is triggering, but lately I’ll fantasize about having one last hurrah of a bender, true oblivion, the whole nine yards. I think it has to do with my being young and having started sobriety kind of quickly (I only expected to go for a month) and my “rock bottom” having been relatively tame compared to the cliche idea i have in my head about what rock bottom could look like. It’s like I feel that because I haven’t abused my body with alcohol to the fullest extent, I can get away with another bender or two in my thirties. 

I know how fucked up this sounds and rationally I don’t think I would do this, at least not any time soon. Maybe I need more of an IRL support network. I never meshed with regular AA, and the Smart Recovery meetings I went to were too lax about moderation for my liking, but maybe I should try again.

I (F/31) have almost 4 months of sobriety and I have been doing a lot of recovery work. However, as the title says, I am really struggling with sober sex and intimacy. 

I started drinking the same time in my life that I started having sex (when I was 18). I have never known sex/intimacy without alcohol and drugs. I very much used substances as a way to feel less inhibited and more relaxed. 

Now, the prospect of sex without the crutch of substances is terrifying. It’s so hard for me to get out of my own head and to relax. I actually feel viscerally afraid of being touched now and I feel myself shutting down whenever the subject comes up or whenever my partner tries to initiate it. This has been difficult for both of us, and the pressure is making things even worse. I am also on sertraline and birth control which does not help my libido.

Has anyone had the same experience? Were you able to overcome that fear?What did you do?

Thank you for your advice.",62

Finally I robbed a bank, white collar style but was facing some pretty bad consequences. Found myself homeless on a park bench with 3 bucks in my pocket and a half bottle of rum someone left which did it for me. I started walking and came across a building about rehab. They sent me to the toughest one in Canada. Prisoners quit and go back to jail rather than complete the course. I went voluntarily. I had lost my wife and my home and all my possessions and I signed up for hell. This place is private run by ex druggies and drunks with no government help so no bullshit. 5 courses over 5 months with no going off property for 30 days. Besides scrubbing toilets etc, the real pain comes from the ""mornings"" where you gather to bleed your heart out about your wounds and then worst of all the ""nights"" where you are blasted by every member and called out on your bullshit. Meantime you must write the story of your life down on paper which no one else will ever read. Emotionally it is beyond belief how much it tears you up to finally face the truth with others who understand. As an example you have to wash cars for funding drives that transport you to do door to door admitting you are a rehab inmate. People are nice though and usually understand. The car wash is to show you that you never got up to wash your own car at 6am or make your bed until you bounced a quarter off it or ""loved yourself"" enough. You can't even piss without an escort to teach you honesty of not wandering off to be alone. You are never alone. You have to face it all day all week all month. I am not selling this rehab because most of you would not make the emotion break down. When I left I had 2 relapses but shook them off and went on. The judge knew the place and erased my record wishing me luck with my life. It's been 22 years since then. I am still sober.",12

2021-11-12 16:27:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qslbha/this_time_it_will_stick/,This time it will stick!,"Hello all, I have been a troublesome nightime / bedtime drinker for a very long time. I don't see myself as an overly excessive drinker, suffering from blackouts and other very undesirable outcomes, but I do suffer from chronic stopping. The stopping attempts never seem to stick to the point it became my identity and nearly bi-daily goal to stop, making up excuses why it had to be on one ""special"" date or another. I tried to quit on a nice date like 2020-02-02 which is a palindromic date and felt like the most ideal date to stop, as it had a special meaning. 

That didn't stick long, so I sought other ones, like my birthday, the beginning of a month, some other special date and month combinations that felt special to me. At one point I could not stop on uneven day numbers, they had to be even. If the day didn't make sense to me I would reason myself out of a date that would come soon, and pick a later date, or heck just until the weekend was over. Constantly kidding myself this time it would stick. It never did.

See, I need to quit because I drink in the most problematic hours of the day. Nearly never before 8 pm as I am always too busy with stuff, get overly tired and stressed out and need to decompress in the evening. The evening hours always felt like a black hole of where my wife usually sleeps and I am still awake, not knowing what to do with my life and the remainder of the day. Entering 9pm I usually start drinking 0.5L (17oz), Belgian beer 6.5% proof. Then another one, and when I was still awake, I would drink a third, adding a lot of alcohol in my system and pop in a sleeping med to make me sleep on an already ungodly hour in the night. 

The problems it caused where legion. The fact I need to get up around 5:45 am every workday to bootstrap my family for another workday, meant I only got about 4.5 to 5 hours of bad alcohol intoxicated sleep during my drinking days. This broke me, it literally broke me to the point I suffered from a burnout because I could not function at work on a mental and cognitive level where my work demanded me to be, and be there for my family where I wanted to be.

The chronic bad sleep sleep broke my body, it made me horribly overweight, hurting everywhere not the least a almosty daily nagging hangover every day on top of a very, very poor health. I used to run 10 km tracks, and was deemed (by Fitbit) in excellent health. Now I am nearing the poor health on the scale, just past average. How deep could I have sunken? My heartrate goes in cardio mode when I am just walking outside, while my heart could carry me easily through my running sessions twice over.

I kept on stopping after gregretting, after it interfered with work or other obligations, I kept on making excuses, gosh I am so creative with excuses, even now, one day in, I am making the excuse that I can wait one more day because due to Covid related govt measures, they are closing all stores at 8 pm from tomorrow on, that means I would not be able to get a drink and if I would be busy during the day hours I will most likely forget and am not able to get drinks in time. But that is just kidding myself. Because I will always find ways around it. 

Why is this day, 2021-11-12 so different? Well for one, back in 2016 I wrote in this forum too on this VERY DAY. This was my first day of stopping, and I kept it up for nearly 7 months back then. I was in bad health back then too and scared to death I was suffering from something severe, and fear is a good motivator. I felt great in that period, I think it was just boredom that made me fall off the wagon almost 7 months later, or the feeling I had it well under control.

But something else happened this year. My wife nearly died just before Halloween. She drunk more than I did in volume, but spread out over a longer period of the day, even at night, in the early hours of the day, always to tame her pain as she has bad chronic pain. On top of heavy prescribed painkillers, her kidneys and liver stopped functioning, her heart was faltering, and it was close to hours that we might have lost her. I was at work, my daughter at school. It could have ended so very, very wrong. 

She spent 4 days in ICU, hooked to any IV that they had, a feeding tube, oxygen, it was bad. All I could think is I needed to stop drinking. This was the sign because I nearly lost my wife, and with my faltering health and also chronic illness, it could have been me, or would be me if I would continue to drink as much as I did. With my faltering health I could not care for my wife and family on the level that they need me to be. I need to do this for me as I am living a life of empty promises and meaningless goals, as I never will reach them on this devastating path.

So, here I am. My wife is doing better. She is still recovering in the hospital, fluids don't leave her body as easily as they should  yet, as she limps around on two swollen legs but when all goes well she will be home next week.

This event has shaken us both and made us reconsider how precious life is, how precious our time here on earth is, and that living healthy is really a battle worth fighting. The alternative is losing that battle, and that nearly costed us dearly.

My wife will most likely not ever drink again. This near death experience has her quite traumatized, I will not drink one day at the time, for every day, as the thought of qutting forever seems to not work for me, and will continue tricking me in waiting for more special days, or let my brain trick me in postponing it. So postponing starting one day at the time seems like the way to trick my brain right back!

So, here I am, I WILL NOT DRINK TODAY!",4

Driving my son to school hungover, tired, bleary eyed, puffy faced with stomach cramps. And I was exhausted physically and mentally, and back into old behavior like hiding empties and sneaking out to slug a supplemental can or three. Then sliding into hair of the dog drinks earlier and earlier just to try to feel better.

This has been an on and off relapse for a few months, after 6 months of sobriety and working out. I really liked that guy, he was fit, he was healthy and strong, and balanced. And honest, and reliable. And I realized he was happy. So yesterday I just resolved to stop. And chase happiness, and be that guy again.  


Instead of waking up groggy and soaked in sweat, I woke up sober and clear headed this morning. Up early, breakfast made, got my kid to school and attacked the day. And I'm filled with gratitude. So here we go again. Wish me luck. Every journey begins with the first step.

I had a lovely cup of tea instead, which was actually quite delicious. The appointment was three hours long and there was a lot of small talk, which makes me very uncomfortable. I do not know why I struggle so much to communicate like a normal human. I made it through the majority of the conversation and only was badly awkward once towards the end, which I managed to stop from getting any worse once I took a second to let my brain catch up with my anxiety. 

I know this must seem super super dumb, but I am super anxious and I am not confident in my interactions with other people at all. I don't know how to talk to people or how to sit comfortably in silence, so I've been walking into these types of appointment with a couple of glasses of wine already downed and a coffee cup full of more wine. I know those drunk appointments didn't tend to go well, but I was so numbed out, I didn't really care. Now that I'm sober, I was really dreading this appointment sober, but it wasn't terrible and I didn't commit huge faux pas. I wasn't really comfortable at all, but my hair stylist was very nice, and gracious enough to let any weird moments pass without any comment or judgement. I really like how my hair came out and I really am proud I didn't break down and have that champagne after all. I just wish my brain would stop for one minute, so I could be comfortable and enjoy myself in this kind of pampering situation, but that may take a lot of work and experience with this kind of situation.",4

Life has never been better:,"I’m not very active in this community, but I’ve popped in and out of it for 5+ years and figured I’d share my story now that I’m on the other side. I never imagined myself as someone who would STOP drinking. I was always hoping to be able to moderate. Realized a bit over a year ago that was never going to happen, so after years of failed moderation, I quit. And it was the easiest/most rewarding thing I’ve ever done. Truly.

1 year (& 8 days) off the sauce.

The biggest thing I want to get across is that my life is better than it's ever been in every conceivable way, and that's 90% attributable to ditching the booze. Maybe more.

A year & 8 days ago:
-I was single & dating basically anyone with a beard who would chat me up on Tinder
-I was 40 pounds over where my body is happiest
-My debt was a revolving door (and going up)
-My credit was crap
-Face: Red & bloated
-Had never had kombucha
-I spent every night at a bar with strangers, or locked in my room with a bottle/box of wine (unless I was getting drunk on a shitty first date)
-Lying. Sneaking. Hiding. Even from myself.
-I had zero hope for the future

Now:
-Frigging ENGAGED to someone I didn't even meet online, about to move into a dream apartment in a dream neighborhood
-I'm 10 pounds below what my driver's license says, despite not being on a diet or thinking about being on a diet for the first time in 2 decades
-I'm actually paying off my debt, and trying not to beat myself up about my past financial mistakes
-Credit is ""excellent""
-Face: Not too shabby
-Love kombucha. Spend all of my money on kombucha.
-I spend every night cooking delicious & healthy-ish meals for myself & my fiance while he plays guitar
-Nothing to hide. Open book. Some might say too open!
-Hope for the future, healing my inner child, becoming the positive person I was meant to be instead of the cynic I turned into. Also, joined a therapy/support group thing the other day - first session was great!

Previously, I could *maybe* *maybe* see myself taking a year-long break from booze. To prove that I could do it. To justify my continued consumption. To show that I didn't have a problem. The fact that I'm 6 days past what would have been my ""welp, I did it"" date is even more of a testament to this being a for-life decision, and an EASY decision.

""Big Alcohol"" and its big marketing budget got me good. Had me convinced that like off the sauce would be dreary & dull. That I'd lose my sparkle. That could not be further from the truth.

My life is still definitely not perfect, and I do have ""bad days"". But my bad days are so so much more manageable now. I'm learning to actually feel my feelings, rather than push them away.

Which is very unhelpful because I am a mother. Granted his Dad has taken out son out on these hangover days which has enabled me to justify shitty drinking behaviour. One of the nights I went for a slide down the stairs and hurt myself while home alone. My injury is still painful, yet I've binged twice since then. 


My week is pretty good and then Friday rolls around and it's all behind me. I just don't have a switch off button. 

I keep my counter on to remind me of my journey. That I acknowledge my destructive drinking pattern. 

I am just going to keep trying and reading this sub.

I contacted a local addition centre and due to my recent liver diagnosis I have been booked in for 12 therapy sessions every other week! It's in person and each session is an hour long. Plus I get them for free (which is fantastic, never could have afforded them by myself.)

I also worked up and booked my first dentist appointment in years, I am a little worried about it because when I was heavily drinking I would pass out without brushing my teeth and had a lot of days where I threw up, so they are probably not in the best condition. But better late than never.

Called up my doctor and finally did the smart thing and asked for refills of my medication that help me deal with my anxiety and depression. I stopped taking them abruptly a while back for no good reason and really made things a whole lot worse. Today is day two of taking all my medications at the right time.

I have been following the meal plan that the hospital gave me and am eating better and healthier than I have in years.

Finally, I had a check-up at the hospital, it's only been a bit over a week since I was discharged. My blood test came back today and have seriously improved. To top it of it was the first time I was really fully comfortable getting blood taken. I used to be so afraid of needles, I'd faint and have panic attacks, but after staying in the hospital for nearly two weeks and getting my blood taken multiple times a day I seem to have conquered the fear. Barely felt a thing.

All round, good news.",10
2021-11-12 15:38:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qska4p/one_week_sober_recap/,One week sober - Recap,"Today is day 8. I officially made it through my first week sober in more than five years. I never thought I'd make it past the first few days, so I'm starting to feel a little proud and I'd like to tell a short story.

During college (while living in student housing) I started drinking. No big deal right? Everyone does so, it's ""part of the college life"". With the drinking came smoking, and with smoking came weed. My parents never knew, and even when I moved back home for a few months during my final thesis, the drinking, smoking and weed never went away. I hid beer under my bed (at room temperature, but it still was beer so it was good enough...) and every second I could sneak away I'd smoke.

Then after college, the second I got a job, I moved out again. And then it really became a daily thing. Living alone, every day right after work, the first thing I'd do is crack open a beer and smoke. A lot. Every afternoon, every night. Just to forget everything. The day, work, family, hobbies, everything.

Until a week ago. I got a funny feeling in or around my liver, got *really* scared, thought about what the hell I was doing and kicked the alcohol instantly. Then a few days after (now 4 days ago) I stopped smoking too. The first few days were surprisingly easy, at the end of the week it became harder and harder. I've found myself going on daily walks (1,5hr+) just to distract myself and that helped a LOT. And now it's friday night, which I usually spend at a friends house who also doesn't drink and we're just sitting around, watching TV, talking, laughing, just having a lot of fun. And feeling a lot better then seven days ago.

I'm grateful to be here. To be here sober. To have someone to talk to. And since there's no alcohol around at this place I'm actually sure I'll make it to day 9, but at this very moment that's not even important. And off course I'm grateful with this community, reading your stories every day. I may not comment much (or maybe at all) but reading everything helps more then I could imagine.

Ok, that's it for story time. I'm going to enjoy another sober night and hope you all will too!

To be honest, I could basically count the number of times I had a drink since the beginning of the pandemic on one hand, so I didn’t think I had anywhere close to a problem, but I recently decided to take an extended visit back to my hometown (I currently live in a different country), and I’ve been drinking a lot.

It seems like alcohol is ever present in social situations here with my friends who I haven’t seen in years, and I kind of suspect they see me as the “party friend” because there is always this assumption we’re going to drink.

I don’t drink much at all in my current city, but I’m finding it very difficult not to do it while I’m here.

Sure, I should have poured it down the drain, but you understand.  

On Monday the 8th, my records show I racked up 25 shots for the day.  8 before work, 17 afterwards.  Gee, no wonder I felt so off on Tuesday.  Yesterday (Thursday the 12th) was ""only"" 18 shots, 9 before work, 9 after.

Years ago, when I realized I was ""double-drinking"", I knew I didn't have just a slight drinking problem.

While there are some errands I could do, my typical strategy is honestly to just stay the frak home. Getting in the car runs the risk I make a really stupid detour to the alcohol emporium.  Physically I feel mostly fine.  No nausea, really.  It's mostly mental.  As the emotions return, I get really sentimental.  Earlier, I thought of Smash Bros Melee, and how I'll never be able to play it with my friends again, not like it was.

Yeah, silly.  But, emotions are like that.

In a previous thread, someone suggested making a list of things to do for the day.  Such obvious advice, but hey, sometimes you need to be told the obvious.  My default passing-the-time is youtube.  If I had vodka, oh yeah, I can do that easy.  But, with my reward center under repairs, that's not sustainable for too long.

Even if it is small things, I find doing them and annotating them makes me feel some iota of accomplishment.  Speaking for myself, when I'm on a wet streak, the desire to do 'little things' is so gone.

* Shower (Done!)
* Eat breakfast
* Dishes
* Trash
* Litter boxes
* Vacuum
* Laundry (socks)
* Organize spice rack
* Clean bathroom counters
* Go for a walk outside (sunlight!)
* Write for nanowrimo, even a little
* Stage gymbag for tomorrow
* Different level of Left4Dead
* Build a house in Sims4
* Role a new character in Skyrim
* Pick one movie to sit down and watch-watch tonight

You really helped me the last few nights. I am sick of feeling ashamed of myself. Spending hundreds on wine and booze.  My husband, my kids who I just want to do a good job for and make proud. All these years, 11yrs since it got really bad, broken up by sober pregnancies. I swore I would stop after, next month or next year, by the time my oldest gets __ I'll be done for good. I did too, once for about 30 days. Aside from that they are getting older and I am getting worse. Most times after I had babies I had a glass of wine when I got home after.  The loneliness and monotony of going from a busy career to a SAHM so far from family and friends was hard for me. I was so grateful to be there, but worried about myself with so much time and I was right to worry. Every night, starting at 7pm initially but it moved to 4-5 it starts. What I look forward to all day after being up all night with baby and exhausted with toddlers. Relaxing and drinking and finally just being alone for a few minutes. But I don't know how to stop and most nights I don't remember my nightly shower/going to sleep. My house looks perfect from the outside but I've fallen in front of my kids, been sloppy and thrown things and yelled. Im so ashamed.  All that matters to me now is that we are as close to healthy as we can be on the inside, and that's on me. I have to do this. 

Today is day 4, I don't want my husband/kids to be ashamed of me. I don't want to miss their lives, I want to be here when they need me. I don't want to shrug and assume it's just the mommy wine culture (I've tried this on myself before) when I can't stop like other people. I can feel the drinking taking its toll on my organs, body and face. The nights are the hardest for me, busy, husband traveling, exhausted with kids and no glass in hand.  This world is so scary and hard I just don't know how people can do this. Send me some good juju from 4-8pm because i need it because I am not drinking with you tonight ❤️.

I basically drove some friends away. Posted about it a while ago, and havent heard anything back from the friends in question. Basically I got drunk one night, and got mad about something, and really went for the throat of one of them. He texted me the next morning and I knew I had messed up. 

I've said my sorrys. Explained the issue. I'm fine with that. What I want to know is when does this stop.. even if I had been sober, I just get mad at the tiniest things now. Sad about the tiniest things. Walking up the stairs drains me. I know my body is adjusting after two years of a bottle of whiskey a day, and now it's lucky to get a case of Michelob a week, but man I thought it would be ""quit drinking so much and things will get better,"" but it feels like I'm becoming a worse person. 

I don't feel laid back anymore. I feel tense. Like a ticking time bomb of emotion ready to go off on whoever's unlucky enough to be around me when the timer hits zero. I want to hermit up. Isolate myself until it's better",11

I never really hit rock bottom. I have disappointed myself by drinking more than I meant to, but it's never resulted in anything terrible. However, my dad is an alcoholic who has never quit and every time we're together and he's super drunk and he says something to me or does something that he can never take back it makes me hate the person he is when he is drunk. I assume he probably wasn't that bad when he was my age but that it got worse and worse over time; what if that's the same path I'm on?

So yeah. What do you do when people question what you're doing and then you yourself are like ""am I overreacting to this problem?"" Yeah, I can handle what I drink and quit when I'm at parties, but my line of thinking last weekend scared the shit out of me when I had recognized that I had gotten drunk alone and that if I threw the bottle in the recycling, there wouldn't be any evidence and the only person I'd let down would be me.

I will not drink with you today. I want to keep this up forever, I think, but for sure until 2021 is almost over where maybe I'd have one glass of champagne at my sister's wedding on New Years Eve, but also, I could just have the fake stuff and that would be fine, too! N/A beers have gotten really good and lit and I have not yet tried an N/A champagne, but I'm sure there are decent ones of those too.

*”A certain darkness is needed to see the stars.”*

I love those kinds of phrases. *”It’s always darkest before the dawn.”* is another one.

The topic in the DCI (edit* Daily Check In) today reminds me of times in my past as budding friendships have bloomed, in that moment when the superficial layer has peeled back and we start to get real with each other.  When we both see that we’ve found a *good one*. A common theme has been to laugh about our shared flaws, the skeletons in our respective closets that are so similar they could wear the same skin.

We’d agree that the best kinds of people were just the right kind of screwed up to share our brand of humor. That’s a star I see now. The way that the roughest experiences of life have left ripples on my soul that can manifest in laughter at what life throws at me.

Not all the time. I’ve spent a lot of these now 43 days a weepy freak, but I can also look back and laugh with my inner crybaby. I have to admit I’m glad she’s back. Before this I hadn’t had a good cry in… well shit, I can’t remember how long. Plenty of reasons to do it, but I stoically watched the moments sail by from within the translucent cocoon of a bottle of Sauvignon blanc.

So these ripples that have given me the grit to make some truly great connections stick, they’re lined up in front of the grooves I’m carving as I work through the process of getting sober from alcohol. I’m looking forward to making connections with the people I’ll stick to as I go through this. I’m hoping to make the grooves deep and solid so they can grab on tight to the future I want to have. One with clear eyed mornings, restful nights, and days without drinking.

Went to an AA meeting because getting drunk every night is starting to really suck. 

The meeting was weird. Not for any specific reason, just AA seems weird.

Introduced myself got my little token. Had someone offer to be my sponsor, really cool guy. 

Of course I was invited to a concert by friends after and so I definitely drank. Had a really fun time. 

I realize I don’t want to be devoutly sober like people in AA but I don’t want to be an alcoholic.

I want to drink SOMETIMES because never drinking feels like some sort of self-punishment. Listening to people talk about never drinking for years in AA sounds almost like someone saying how long they’ve been in prison or something.

2021-11-12 10:34:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qsdqix/i_made_it_back_he_didnt/,I made it back. He didn't.,"Hi everyone!

For those of you who are freshly joining the Ginger_Sprout saga, I'm coming back to sobriety after a relapse. I was sober for three years before I relapsed, and before that I had a relapse of a year and a half after a year and a half of sobriety, and before that I had a couple of shorter periods of sobriety and shorter relapses. I have done a lot of back and forth with this recovery thing. I've spent more time now struggling with my drinking and getting sober than I spent actually enjoying my drinking, it's been a problem for me for longer than it was just something that I enjoyed.

Anyway, SD has been a significant part of my recovery, and AA has as well. I'm realizing, coming back to AA, that I have a hard time understanding that other people care about me. I just don't really compute that my absence or presence has much of an effect on anyone or that people care, on an emotional level, about how I'm doing. It's something that goes on inside of me and is unrelated to what other people do or don't do. I'm just realizing that my perception of the world is flawed and that I'm projecting my own false beliefs on other people. It's actually pretty sad, now that I think about it. It's just something that I don't see.

I've been back attending meetings at the Alano Club I've frequented and have been a little surprised at how many people care about how I'm doing. Like other times I've come back I came back almost feeling like I had to give a presentation on what I did wrong and how I screwed up and what I'm going to do to fix that. Like, I'm walking in the door assuming that I have to have everything already solved and figured out on my own so that people can pass judgement. 

And nobody cares. They genuinely don't care what I did wrong. The response has been along the lines of, ""Well yeah, you're an alcoholic. Me too. I'm glad you're back."" And more people than I would have thought have expressed real love and concern and support, and much more than I would have thought. My absence mattered because my presence matters, and people genuinely care about me. It's so easy for me to forget that and to go back into my prison of loneliness, and I'm realizing that I matter more to other people than I ever realized. It's a weird feeling, it's not entirely comfortable, and yes, I'm getting back into therapy.

The last time that I got sober, there was a guy about my age who got sober a couple of months after me. He was sober for about a year and was really active in his recovery. He was a sweet guy who made a lot of friends. And then he relapsed. He'd show up for meetings sometimes struggling, and had some periods of a month or two sober, but he never regained his traction in sobriety. I've asked around if anyone has heard from him since the pandemic started, and he'd reach out to people occasionally, usually asking to borrow money. 

Last night I found out that he was dead. He died of a heart attack. He was whippet thin and rode his bike a lot and he was around 40, and he wasn't a drug guy, he and I had talked about our drinking and we were both alcoholics to the core. I'm sure that he would still be alive if he hadn't been drinking.

I feel a terrible sadness over his death but I haven't cried over it yet. I wasn't surprised to hear the news, but it's such a senseless death. And I can see it in someone else, from an external perspective, how much of an impact he made on other people when he was active in his recovery and how much people cared about him when he went back out. I cared about him. 

I remember the last time that I ran into him at a meeting, giving him a hug because I was so flipping happy to see him. And now that I think about it he did the exact same thing that I do, he talked about what he had done wrong to relapse, how he had screwed up, and how he was fixing it. And I didn't care, I was just happy to see him, but I don't think that he could connect with that, he was withdrawn into this other place of internal judgement. It's hitting me like a ton of bricks right now how much his response was like mine.

I'm incredibly lucky that I was able to get sober again after such a brief relapse. It almost doesn't make sense that my drinking wasn't more excessive than it was. I mean, by normal people standards I was drinking a lot, but I was never even really drunk, I never blacked out, it never got messy. And I was able to quit. I was incredibly lucky in that, it's actually a genuine flipping miracle. 

By the time I quit drinking my drinking was round the clock mayhem. My binges were horrific. My drinking wasn't always like that, I had many years of being able to drink in a fairly sedate manner a lot of the time, but the last time I relapsed it was literally drinking until I passed out then waking up and drinking again for several days, I literally couldn't funnel alcohol into my body fast enough. I am incredibly lucky and blessed that it didn't happen for me like that this time around, and I'm not inclined to press my luck until things fall apart, because that's where I'm headed if I do. 

I'm grateful to be sober again. I'm grateful for the people in my life who care about me. It has been a strange journey, this sobriety thing, and I don't know where it's taking me. But I'm grateful to be here. Sending hugs.

This is  a huge accomplishment  for me and I wanted to share it with everyone that post that I get so   
  much out of reading every day . I am not alone on this journey  

This  is the by far the longest I’ve ever gone without drinking since I was a Freshman in High School  ,   
  that was over 4 decades ago . I have tried to quit at least 75 times 

For the most part , I was drinking every evening  six or more drinks  , weekends usually more . I hid it   
  well from everyone in my life except myself 

My drinking  has progressively increased over the years in quantity like many of us have experienced 

So today ,  it’s still not easy ( I almost caved last evening ) and I have a long way  to go  but  life  is  a so much better because :   


I don’t  wake up without  a recollection of the night before.

I don’t  sleep like shit anymore  , snoring ,  waking up  at 2;30am and not really falling back to sleep  and suffering from sleep deprivation 

I don’t   have to hide  the evidence  of the empties 

I don't have to feel guilty for not being present and living a dual life 

I don't miss the constant  battle going on in my head over never drinking or not. 

I don’t miss  having a low  sense of self-esteem  , being overweight , having  high blood pressure ,   
  being  red faced and puffy looking

I don’t miss  driving being  subject to a DUI 

Being A free is  so worth it  and my hope is that anyone  reading this gets the message that's its   
 possible to make a change like this 

 No matter what day I am or you are  on,  its only one day, today that we will not drink

I have been drinking heavily for about 5 years now. I was sober for 35 days and dropped all the way down to 185 without even changing my diet (which admittedly isn’t the best - I’m working on that too) My face looked so much thinner. I could even start to see my abs again, which I haven’t seen since my early 20s 😂. Maybe it’s slightly egotistical but looking in the mirror and loving what you’re looking like can be the best feeling ever! I lack self confidence sometimes. 

Unfortunately over the last couple of weeks I drank heavily and ate extremely poorly. All the way back up to 200 pounds in a matter of weeks. 

Getting back on the wagon now, and looking better is one of my great motivators on top of all of the other benefits!!

Obligatory I feel great, I’ve been getting more opportunities at work, food tastes better (I’m a chef so this is a big plus), and one of my coworkers mentioned that I’ve seemed a lot more happy lately. 

My struggles have been that I have not lost any weight, I’ve actually gained a couple of pounds but this is likely do to my anti depressants and without getting serious about taking care of my mental health earlier this year I never would have been able to get sober. Also, I’m a big advocate of body positivity, fat positivity, and self love so time to practice what I preach! 

My other struggle is that I’ve realized that my chronic migraines and headaches were not always just hangovers so I am trying to find the best way to treat those (currently trying acupuncture). 

Even with the struggles though, the journey has been 1000% worth it! I can’t wait to see what lies ahead.

Obviously for the next few years (only stopped last year, so maybe 4-5 months ago I ""sobered"") I will just be lonely, doing college, eventually after surgery, working out, probably pick up a part time job.

I was very young, I developed a nasty and rare version of the DT's, I was one of the few folk that would get recurring grand malignant seizures. Obviously when living alone this would cause problems, I then got back with my mum, were the last year or two, I shaked, seized and wanked my way sober.

How likely is it, that if I keep up with recovery, keep focused on my health, that maybe at the age of 35 or so, I could maybe go to a different country, meet a girl, be honest about my past, though by then I would have years of ""stable"" recovery, hopefully distancing myself a little from alcohol withdrawal (which I think looks like tripping to others not versed in withdrawal - I mean this as I have a version of myself that exists in drugs and drink, then a version of myself which is sad, lonely and suppressed by drink)",5

I remember the first time I drank, I had a beer and I hated it. It wasn’t until a fraternity event in college that I “decided” I liked it. This progressed until I decided I liked wine and liquor too. 15 years later, I seem to be remembering how it used to be. I’m grateful for that and hope to leave alcohol abuse behind.",11

One of my huge triggers is being tired. I've explained this to my bf countless times about how important sleep is for me. However nearly every day this past week he has been waking me up in the middle of the night, and then I can't go back to sleep. It throws me off track for the next day, and I can't focus or get anything done, and I'm less able to fight off the cravings. Since I'm already doing nothing I start to think ""why not"" and it's harder to fight off. We got into an argument about him leaving me to sleep and I slept on the couch and got a full night's sleep, and I thought he understood, but last night he did it again. 

Not only that, but he came home with a 12 pack (he doesn't normally drink at all, like I haven't seen him have a drink in months) and had a couple then went to bed. He's leaving out of town for the weekend (another trigger) and leaving alcohol in the house. 

I'm feeling disappointed. And confused. I don't want to tell him he can't have alcohol if he wants it, and I can't figure out of he's purposefully sabotaging me or testing me, or just being inconsiderate. A part of me thinks he's wearing me down, leaving with alcohol here, just to ""surprise"" me and see if I'm drinking or not. Wouldn't be the first time he's done something like that, but it feels really mean to do when I'm still fairly early in sobriety. Does he want me to fail? 

Any thoughts/tips/advice?",27

I spent 6 days in the hospital because of my jaundice and ascites. While I'm proud of myself that I didn't drink for so long (can't remember last time that happened in over 10 years), I had a lot of help from the lovely nurses giving me librium everyday when I got too shaky and anxious, the food was great too, I ate more than I've been able to in a long time. I consider myself very lucky that I didn't have much worse WDs, I think my taper to a low amount before I went in helped.

Now the hard part though, being home. The cravings are bad and my doctor only prescribed me 5 single ativan pills in case I got bad again along with a ton of vitamins and a steroid to hopefully help the ascites that came on fast. I can't sleep. I bought a bunch of sweet stuff to try to stave off the cravings. I really can't drink a drop though because my liver and spleen are so fucked up with cirrhosis and alcohol induced hepatitis. I feel lost and depressed. I had no idea I could get this bad as a 30f. I get out of breathe easily too even though they said my lungs look and sound fine.

There's just so many triggers to want to drink here at home even though my bf threw out,/drank all the rest of the alcohol except a bottle of red that I use for cooking. Anyone have any tips or tricks in dealing with all this? I'm not to the type to deal with actual rehab centers and I have to work. Thoughts? Help?

I'm still half drunk. It's 8 in the morning and I still half drunk from yesterday.

It was a corporate event, a fair, or whatever you call it (not native here). But you got the picture. Lot of free alcohol and we had whiskey and I never drink whiskey.

I'm embarrassed. Even my dog look embarrassed.

I need help.

At the same time I'm kind of introvert, so the alcohol really helped me interact with my peers. Yesterday it was ok, it helped me connect with nice people. I still think there's a sweet point. I was so tired by the end of the fair, yesterday evening. If it wasn't for the drinks I would hit home and didn't talk with nobody. I hate small talk, i can't talk with normal people for a long time without alcohol. But I can. I stopped drinking for 3 months with help from you guys and I could communicate well.

In Japan they have these convenience stores at every street corner that sell booze and smokes. Needless to say the occasional drink when walking home from work became something that I enjoyed.

Smash cut to the pandemic; I started drinking daily, even during the mornings if I had a day off work. There was just nothing else to do. I stopped exercising and gained a bunch of weight (which I had worked so hard to lose previously)

Last night, I got blackout drunk again and I don't remember getting home. Thankfully nothing bad happened but it's very scary when I lose my memory. 

I've attempted to quit multiple times and here's another try, but this time I can't afford to fail as I'm starting to get really sick from it.

As a female, I could always out chug and drink most of my guys friends. I thought I was so cool. Still have some anxiety with being sober, always would drown that out with alcohol so trying to deal with that but it’s pretty cool not waking up with a hangover! 50 lbs might seem like a lot in that time but I am extremely overweight so a lot of that is water weight. My doctor said all my results are good! 

Our livers are so forgiving as long as we stop abusing them. There is so much more to life than alcohol. You can do it",101

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 Happy Friday! let me say how much I enjoyed hearing from you yesterday. You are an epically kind and brilliant lot and we are truly an epic global crew 😊

I know the beginning of this journey can be so damn hard and want to focus on the upside a bit today.

Several decades ago, an aunt and uncle of mine who were both active in alcohol recovery communities also both had cancer.  Their responses to their battles absolutely blew me away.  I was young with no real clue about life yet. 

I well remember a conversation with my Aunt in which she told me with a smile – “You have to find the gift, dear.  In everything.”  I couldn’t fathom what she was talking about, but her wisdom was great and I felt it.  She later flashed me her new boobs (post reconstruction after double mastectomy), which was a hoot.  And told me one of her acts of service was to visit patients facing the same thing and tell them her story, sharing hope and a flash if they wanted. So cool.

I’m telling you this today because we – you and I – are the lucky ones.   We get to find the gift.

A certain darkness is needed to see the stars.  

We’ve been there, you and I.  We’ve resided in the darkness.  And now we move toward the gift of seeing the stars in each other, living sober and connecting while we do it. How awesome is that!

In the words of Brad Pitt:  “I got sober because of this guy (Bradley Cooper) and every day has been happier since.” – That’s why we’re here and that’s what each of you is doing for one another 😊

In the event you’re tempted to drink because it’s Friday and you still mistakenly think alcohol is cool, please know that Sobriety is absofreakinlutely cool!  Don’t buy into the lie that it’s lame – that’s the booze industry talking. You are meant for so much more than to fall for lies and poison.

IWNDWYT my sober and sober seeking friends.  Happy Friday and here’s to a Sober Weekend.  Would love to hear where you have seen the stars in the darkness, found a gift, or seen what’s cool about Sober life.

And again, if anyone with 30 days or more of sobriety would like to host the DCI, please let our fearless leader Saint Homer know.",321

I’m 24m and while my drinking isn’t as bad of a problem as it’s been before, I’ve just made some choices that sober me feels sad and disappointed in myself about. I know that if it weren’t for acting on the same old urge to go and have a drink, I wouldn’t have gone and done what I’ve done to make myself feel how I feel now. I’ve robbed myself of the joy and confidence that I had in myself believing that I am truly a good person. My actions don’t align with my belief, so instead I’m questioning it, for now. 

I have some work to do, some positive choices, self care, acts of kindness and selflessness in store to forgive myself and prove to myself that my heart is laden with good intentions. I know that comes so much easier when stacking day after day without that poisonous elixir clouding my judgement, and so that I shall try to do to the best of my ability. Here’s to day one.

I had a dream last night where I was drinking and the experience of drinking in the dream was such a relief. I've been sad about it all day today because I had a great day yesterday prior to that dream. After a great (sober) day with so much to be grateful for, I still desperately wanted to drink. I struggle with cravings for alcohol frequently. Sometimes, I want to drink so badly that I cry at night. I'm wondering if something is deeply wrong with me, because I have remained sober for almost nine months. It hasn't gotten easier.

I am much more in control emotionally now than before I got sober. That's why I stay sober. I have a history of complex trauma, and I was dissociating frequently when I drank. I was negatively impacting others with my behavior. I don't do very disruptive things anymore, although I still struggle with dissociation.

But it feels like constant deprivation to be without alcohol. I get so sad because I know that the reason I can't drink like ""normal"" people in my life is that I'm mentally ill, and I need to work hard to manage myself and I can never take a break from that. Being sober allows me to function and not burden other people emotionally. But alcohol allowed me to actually relax and breathe. Nothing else has ever matched that feeling, before or since.

I wish that I were un-fucked-up enough that I could actually handle the pleasure of alcohol. As it stands, I'm increasingly convinced I'm facing a boring, anxious, lackluster life for the sake of self-control. I know I can't handle moderation because I'd already obsessively plan my life around when I'm ""allowed"" to drink when I was actively drinking--it sucked. At least now I don't have to constantly be thinking about the next drink because there won't be one.

I want to believe that this gets better. Has anyone out there struggled with sobriety like this and worked through it? I am also wondering if trauma-specific therapy will decrease my desire to drink. Can anyone speak to their experience of sobriety during/after trauma treatment?

I started a brand new job and got completely fucked over. Was supposed to be an easy training day but instead I got thrown to the wolves basically and set up to fail. Ended up crying half my shift due to being so stressed and overwhelmed about the job. Kept thinking about getting hammered when I got off work. How nice some cold seltzers would be after a long, sweaty day. Ended up quitting the job due to being way overworked with very little traning. No break on a 10.5 hour shift, spent driving. I SHOCKINGLY made it home (while in tears about the awful day I had, etc) without stopping at any liquor store, and I passed probably a half dozen on my way home! So far today was my hardest day staying sober, with yesterday being pretty tough as well. Days 1-3 weren't too bad but day 4 and 5 BLOW.

I'm only 25 years old but have known I was an alcoholic for at least the past five years. I started drinking at 16 occasionally. As a teenager I had some good times drinking, but I was always the one who drank the most and got the sickest. My parents woke up to me choking on my own vomit, my friends have had to call poison control, pretty fucked up. I had some stints of sobriety over the past 5 years. Been to treatment, etc. From when I was 20 until 23, I probably only drank once or twice a week on average. But there would be times I drank 4-5 days in a row and then would take a week off. And when I say I ""drank"", I never ever drank without getting drunk. On average I would drink a pint of vodka or more in a day, or 10-12 seltzers. However, for the past 2 years I was drinking a lot more. Especially the last 6 months. I've been unemployed a lot recently which has had me very bored and drinking more. I was getting drunk 4-5 times a week. A lot of days I would start drinking in the morning even and drink all day long. 

A couple weeks ago I went on a long drinking spree. Probably drank 18 out of 20 days. I started noticing weird pains which scared me enough to check out this sub. Idk what the point of this post was, but I needed to vent. I've tried every thing to ""moderate"" my drinking, but nothing works and I don't wanna ever die a alcohol related death. Alcohol does nothing to improve my life. I've used it for far too long to try to numb my anxiety and depression and it's only made everything in my life worse. Fuck alcohol.",6

He did two tours in Afghanistan and has physical issues that have affected him.  Lives alone with his dogs.  Pretty solitary existence from what I see.   I think he is probably 32 or so.  Today is Veterans Day.   Before I left this morning for a walk with my dog I wrote a simple card - thank you for your service.  Nothing crazy. BUT mind you this is something I would never have done when drinking as I would have been nursing a hangover or generally have my bitchy attitude.

I'm 24, all of my peers drink (nearly) as much as me when we're out and it's acceptable to go out often. They think it's a bit of a joke to stop drinking now and don't understand why I would stop- unless I was drunk constantly, getting arrested, etc. I don't make a huge fool of myself when I drink, rarely blackout, do nothing others aren't. But I'm drinking alone a lot, hiding bottles in my room, stealing housemate's drink, sneaking around at 4am. Binge drinking 4/5 nights a week. Can never stop once I start. Have been using alcohol to deal with emotions for years. My main problem is that I can't find any balance when I'm drinking. I don't exercise, I eat poorly, I stop reading, I have no interests except drinking. It's depressing.

I got to 100 days sober last year and felt great. Did Annie Grace's 30 day challenge and really resonated with it. Started exercising, meditating, reading again etc. Felt I had no desire to drink again, then started again infrequently, then (inevitably) it crept up. I feel really incapable of looking after myself at all when I'm drinking - does anyone else have that? Even though I'm not drinking *that* much (or am I?), I can't seem to function well at all. My health goes to shit along with all my hobbies and interests. I don't think I'd be questioning my drinking if I was drinking this much but still fit, a normal weight, making time for other things. They seem mutually exclusive in my head! 

I know the problem is probably with society and not me - as in, we're told to only get worried when we're drinking vodka in the mornings and homeless. It's making me angry. It's making me angry that I have to completely go against the grain to stop drinking and have to be a 'freak' in a  culture where drinking is ubiquitous in your twenties. I genuinely feel it would be easier if I was older. I'm angry that alcohol is put on an unquestioned pedestal in the UK and Ireland. I'm angry that people make jokes about NA beers. That they don't consider weekly guidelines to be a serious recommendation at all. It's all making it much harder to accept that I have a problem!! Or am I full of shit?

My only option is to walk to the liquor store. 

I'm feeling confident and know I'm not going to slip, so I walk to the store and buy six single cans of La Croix. A few thoughts - 1) The drunk girl ranting about Chardonnay is REALLY loud and REALLY annoying. 2) This guy I bought a sixer from every night probably thought I was dead and now I return two weeks later and buy six waters lol. 3) Even this expensive way to buy La Croix is saving me $1.50 compared to the price of beer. 4) If I was drinking, I also would have invested the 5 singles in my pocket in scratchers, so I saved $6.50 by not drinking tonight. 5) I usually buy generic La Croix for $.25 a can, so every night I drink that instead of beer I'm saving $6.50. 6) I can't believe I used to come to this store every night. 7) That girl still won't shut up about Chardonnay. 8) Coconut La Croix is pretty gross.",24

Cooking, in an overly precise and engaged way, has been my own therapy for the past few years. (I have celiac and can't eat gluten, hence the life-change.)

But, one of my proudest realizations have been (since I now have had personally ""long"" bouts of sobriety) noticing how much more I've enjoyed the process of cooking with a more mindful, minimally distracted, and entirely sober perspective.

Forgive my language here but I need to vent. How the fuck is it anyone else's business what I consume? I'm still having a good time. 

I mean, I get it - it's really about them. They need the validation of seeing other people drink. 

Anyway. I'm on vacation and a certain person keeps pressuring me to drink. I've explained that I'm not going to, and this exchange is getting really old. I'm getting very upset at having to have the same conversation over and over again. 

I've made it about me. Things like: 
I just feel better when I'm not drinking. 
This is what's best for me. 
I've tried to cut back but I've learned that I really just have to not drink at all. 
I can't just have one. 
Drinking is really unhealthy for me, it makes me feel depressed and anxious, I know it doesn't affect everyone that way but I realized that's what happens for me when I drink. I don't have fun anymore. 

I guess the next step is to say directly that I need them to back off because I don't want to talk about this again, right? When someone pushes at my clearly stated boundaries, I get pissed and inevitably sound like a bitch when I address it, so I've been just gritting my teeth and hoping that being a broken record will work. But I don't think that's going to happen.

It's becoming clear this person has a drinking problem and is trying to get me to drink so that they feel better about drinking around me. I don't need to deal with that because they obviously aren't ready to hear that. I just need them to back off. Thanks for listening.",28

I’ve googled this and read plenty of articles on whether or not this is a good idea, all of which basically come to the conclusion: it depends on the person.

Have any of you tried this? What was your experience? Has it triggered a relapse? Curious to hear everyone’s thoughts and, as always:

I managed to earn a decent living and start a family, but always felt like a failure due to my lack of college degree.

Achieving this goal well exorcise many of my demons.

I consider myself lucky that I wasn’t affected by it in a major way as a child, my mom did a fantastic job of shielding us kids from it. I only had to deal with the drama starting when I was in high school. Long story for a different time.

I’m 4 years out of college and have had my incidents here or there with overdoing it and getting too drunk, both in college and after. My question is recently I have started to get cravings for alcohol. I normally only have a few drinks maybe once a week. But during the week after work I feel myself wanting to have a drink. I wouldn’t necessarily consider this a problem but given my family history I am on high alert to this stuff. Has anyone dealt with anything similar? I do not want to go through the same situations as my father and my grandmother. I don’t want to do that to myself or my family. My girlfriend has mentioned how she doesn’t like who I am when I heavily drink, so I really keep it to a minimum especially around her. Another can of worms there I know.

I don't relax with alcohol, I get taken over by it. I can't vacation with alcohol, I would be drinking alcohol with maybe some vacation activities (given I don't cancel them to accommodate my heavy drinking). In some ways, I wish I could be one of those people that just moderates but that isn't and won't ever be me. I know that and have proven that time and time again.

I don’t drink a ton volume-wise to begin with but I always do in basically every social situation. I did used to drink a lot in college about 8 years ago. So it’s going to be a noticeable change to anyone who knows me. And now the meds I’m on are all psych meds and I don’t want to have to tell everyone my whole medical history every time I say I’m not drinking so I’m overwhelmed thinking about how I’m going to justify not drinking.

I’m from southeastern Wisconsin, where drinking is a huge part of the culture and both my family and my in-laws are no exception to that. In fact there’s a lot of unacknowledged alcoholics in both sides of the family, that’s how much drinking goes on.

Then my husband is a medical resident and essentially every social event with his co-residents centers around drinking, and I want to be able to still go with him.

How do you all navigate social situations without consuming alcohol? How do you tell people you don’t drink? Do people give you crap about it? Or do people not even notice and I’m blowing this way out of proportion?

I am not medically allowed to work and the soonest I can see the doctor who is supposed to allow me to work is over a month away. So I have no income. I had a healthy amount saved up in my bank accounts since I didn't spend any money for a month, about 9k, not including credit cards. However, in the process of applying for medicaid to avoid being in debt for the rest of my life, they instructed me to spend all my money and use all my credit cards to prove that I had limited assets. I explained to them that this is student loans and credit cards. It's money I have to pay back. They didn't care. I was against the idea at first but sooner than later I came around to it and spent all my money.

It's Thursday night which for me used to mean thirsty Thursday, time to get buzzed/drunk. Two drinks turns into five (which is probably more like eight because I'd have pints of craft beer and glasses of my home made wine which were often strong). 

I would justify and make excuses by saying its Thursday night and somehow that made ingesting solvent ok....Tomorrow is Friday time to celebrate with poison. 

I don't have to work till noon tomorrow. If this was the case last month I would probably drink a lot tonight.

I'm avoiding alcohol. It sucks and makes me feel like shit. Last time I drank I was anxious, scared, and guilty. I almost called out of work in the morning because the anxiety was so bad. That would mean I have a problem or would be approaching addiction.

That was a wake up call. I've been anxious anyway because of the time change and I regularly take antidepressants. Mixing meds with alcohol is a really bad idea. I've been in the psych hospital twice for psychosis and have trauma from those stays. 

I know alcohol will lead to bad things and ruin my mental health. 

I can only take it one day at a time. 

These two weeks of sobriety have been fantastic! I wake up earlier and well rested, I lost some beer bloat, I have more energy, I'm more productive, healthier, and my mood has been stable. 

I'm not saying sobriety fixed everything but it has given me a baseline to be 1% better everyday.

From a young age I struggled with depression and anxiety. Like most, I experienced my own series of traumatic events that also fed into my drinking. I became a daily drinker around 16 but never got arrested or fired or divorced so in my mind I was golden. Never mind the fact I was sick from the time I woke up until the time I drank my first drink of the day. I hated life all the time but I really believed hating life was too be expected and just part of the grind. 844 days ago I for every reason other than myself quit drinking cold turkey. I had to prove to my husband I was fine and had 0 issue. He needed to know it was him with the problem, not me, and I was ready to show him. I spent a month physically ill as my mental health deteriorated beyond recognition. I went from wanting to die to planning my death. I went to inpatient treatment as a way to feel less guilty when I went home to kill myself, as I saw no hope or possibility of improving. I felt terminal and as though I was agreeing to short term chemo just to humor my loving family.
 The past 844 days have been far from what I expected. For one I'm alive. But with not drinking I've been able to really figure out where I got stuck in life. Inside and out, I've found a version of myself I didn't know existed. It's been the hardest but most worthwhile 844 days of my life. When I was drinking,  my first thought of the day, before I would even open my eyes, was ""Fuck. I'm awake."" Now I can't wake up fast enough.

To be honest yeah it's fun and it'll make you happy for a sec but all in all it's not worth it for me and I'd rather not.  


I have quit drinking before but it's just and on and off thing. I have never reached in what I feel a consistent long-term period of sobriety and I wanna quit for good. So I feel if I do at least 6 months naturally I will just stop drinking altogether - I hope.  

Me + drinking is just overdoing it, inappropriate drunk behaviour , drinking at in appropriates places and times,  the hangover, money, energy, etc etc etc. I could write a dossier but yeah it's got to the point for me where it's too much now. 

I'm happy there is a space like this and a sense of community to support each other.  I know that it's wise to take sobriety on a moment to moment basis but I just feel as though having that 6 month target in the background will help me have a somewhat long-term prescriptive of the change that will happen. I don't know really I just wanna stop drinking.

I'm 10 days in so far and a couple of days were really rough emotionally. It was also weird not being able to just go to the refrigerator and grab some wine some lonely nights in my apartment. But it's still easy for me to not buy alcohol, or to turn it down when it's offered to me. 

Can anyone else relate?

My life is better without it. Period. There are other things to love. Alcohol and I have bad chemistry. We have to break up, so I wrote this letter to tell it how I’m feeling.

Dear Alcohol, 

It's not gonna work out. We had many good years, so many great memories, laughs, and late nights. You've comforted me, given me courage, and you make me damn funny w/ a sprinkle of spice. 

We've also had a lot of bad years, lost memories, missed days. Missed opportunities for connection. You made me loud and annoying, had me apologizing for things I don't remember doing or apologizing for something I wish I could forget. You make me mean and dishonest. You make me reckless, selfish, angry. 

You're not all to blame though; I used you. I used you to separate myself from my pain, from other people, from my life. I was afraid of the life I was building, of the person I was becoming, I was afraid to fail… and you wrapped me up like a warm hug and gave me a place to belong. You took away the notion that, in reality, I had built my life in a way that left me all alone. 

• • •

I loved you but when it came time to love me too, there was nothing left. I waited and wished I could find a way to have both in my life. I tried giving up everything else to keep you but now it's clear:

You will never love me, I will never be anything more than a mistress, and you will never offer more than false hope and lies. We were never good together, I was just too young and misguided to see it. Then after a while, all I could see was you. My only comfort, I hated you. I hated me for loving you but I felt so void of value, pressing into you was my only place a solace . I lost sight of my heart as you burried it beneath layers of guilt, shame, anger, and abuse.

I thought I had given up... but now I think I may have needed the rest. Did I run away, headlong into the problem? Absolutely. It's made me who I am though. Strong and resilient with an uncanny knack for appearing like I’ve got it together. 

Except now, I really do have it together. And you’re putting that at risk.

When I look at the life I've built in SPITE of you, I remember how easy it is to lose everything in an instant. I am reminded of every other time I've been at THIS phase of my pattern, the phase where things might actually get good before I fuck it up, and I feel something in me ask, ""if this is not the wake-up call, what will be? What do you need to lose in order to learn? Because you're not learning any other way. It will be through fire.""

• • •

We all go through the fire, that can't be helped. But we do have some say over what things we go through the fire for.

I don't want to waste time, that I could be using on refining and upgrading myself, on the SAME damn lesson, over and over. What a waste of universal education!

So here I go, ready to try loving myself in a new way. one that chooses to face myself instead of turn away and numb out. In a way that is excited to be here, be present, and connect.

We may meet again, Alcohol, but we will never walk long distances. You will be tired, lurking quietly while you wait to suck the life out of another young, misguided, connectionless youth. But me?

I will always remember the scars you give me because I can see them every day but I will forget you. I will be thriving.",35

I drank for like 20 years, finally quitting when I was around 40, thanks to AA.

I did well for another 20 years, until my wife died.  I didn't start drinking because of that, however.  I knew someone who, like me, had quit for some time, and then managed to drink again, on the basis that he was not the same angry young man. He seems to do OK (but, honestly, I might be wrong.)

A month after my wife died I wondered if I would in fact never drink again, or if perhaps I too had changed enough over the last 20 years.  So I gave it a shot.

It went OK at first.  There were times I would get wasted, but mostly I was more or less reasonable.

But something changed over this past year.  I used to be able to keep alcohol in the house and not just drink it all; those days are gone.  I've tried being careful by buying smaller bottles and dumping out half, but inevitably a day comes where I just make up for it.

I see now that this moderation thing is never going to work for me.  

I was drunk the last two days, and finally this morning I told my girlfriend of one year I have a problem and want to stop.  She's very supportive, and I'm glad I told her because I need encouragement.

My wife and I have been together for 10 years come this December. In that 10 years she has supported me while I struggle with alcoholism/addiction. We both come from a background of addiction so she understands, but after almost 10 years, she seems done.

Dozens of attempts and just as many promises the slip-up will not happen again. Running towards recovery excited with a head full of steam only to slip a month, a week later.  I am dying for permenant sobriety. I could not imagine life without my wife, but I will have to because too many times I have chosen alcohol over her, over her needing me to be sober because that's the man she fell in love with, not the addict. 

I know complacency is my worst enemy everytime my days start over. I get excited. I get high off the way my wife and my family look at me and then I make that decision that restarts the clock; I instantly turn into the lying, manipulative addict that I have been trying to kill for years. And that takes more out of my wife's ability to trust me or ever look at me as someone worth having around.

I had one glass of wine too many and by the time I started eating it was too late - I vomited on the floor in the ladies' room and wound up collapsing and being taken to the ER. 

I have always been a little too reliant on alcohol as a way to relieve stress, but the problem is that I can't handle my liquor. I either drink and fall asleep, or drink or get sick. So this time, I decided to give quitting a try. 

At 15 days, I feel much like the way I felt when I quit smoking. The physical effects are not as severe,  but I'm riding a weird mental rollercoaster of cravings and mixed feelings about sobriety - one moment I feel a sense of loss and then an hour later I feel glad to not be drinking. I'm a college student who can't take time off for rehab, so I just quit cold turkey. My experience with this method is that is effective over long periods of time after the brain resets, but the wait for cravings to recede can be pretty hairy.

When I quit drinking alcohol I tracked the days on a memo board with those hash marks in groups of five. I shifted to numerals at some point and can recall doing that until it was well over 60 days. At some point I felt steady enough to note my progress by the number of weeks I've been alcohol-free. It's 43.

I told only my SO and closest friend for the first weeks/months. My experience has been that people feel awkward around the topic, which is understandable if you consider our shame-filled ( ""She's an""--looks side to side, lowers voice--""alcoholic"") alcohol-marinated (""It's Wine O'clock!...Rosé All Day!"") culture.

We keep addiction in the dark. If we speak of it we hush our voice and infuse our tone with a viscous syrup of moral judgement. Celebrating something we think of as negative, like being an addict, can make us uncomfortable...""Congratulations on no longer robbing banks!"" ""Woo hoo, one year of not kicking your dog!"" Awkward.

My highly scientific sample of one (me) indicates it is hard for people, for many reasons, to feel our same joy or know how to ""celebrate"" it without feeling on thin ice...""Yay, you're an alcoholic who quit drinking!....{awkward emoji face}...!?!"" We are accustomed to celebrating things like birthdays, promotions, anniversaries, even cancer-free diagnoses. POSITIVE developments.

Six months AF was a delicious day, and properly remembered by my SO. Next I set 40 weeks as a significant marker. I thought of it as a full-term pregnancy and I had ""birthed a new life."" Few others (none?) remembered and I think it is actually that very day that I went searching for some like-minded place to gain (&give!) support and found THIS group. I've been helped.

So I'm not setting my expectations around my one year AF date LOW, I'm letting them be where they will be. I know it's a g\*ddamn m\*therfu(kin' big deal, hard earned, day by day. I will be reveling in my freedom and will welcome any Dear Human who can celebrate WITH me, IRL or here.

Grateful with you!",73

I made it to being a week sober.Then I visited my dad, who gave me some delicacies he bought in Italy for me, among other things a bottle of white wine.I immediately turned it down, asked him what he was thinking to gift me alcohol.He said it's for cooking, not for drinking. So I explained to him that it is not a good idea to offer a recovering alcoholic a bottle to take home.

I left and was so upset and hurt by his short sighted actions that I later that evening went to the gas station around the corner and drowned my anger about my father who still isn't taking me for full in four beers and one gin tonic.

I feel like shit. I'm nauseous, I had to postpone the date I had with this gorgeous woman today because I slept three hours and feel just sick and unattractive. My anxiety ramped back up to maximum, my depression kicks in and now I'm sitting here crying about my wasted progess, angry about the blown date and so so disappointed in myself.

I have no one to pick me back up right now. Maybe you guys can give me some strength and help me through this dawning night of first soberness again.

I was your typical party girl who drank every weekend in high school, and blacked out all through university, and then I worked at a strip club as a shooter girl where it literally was my job to drink. 7 days a week, then I cut back to only the weekends but as of recently I was drinking 7 days a week. I work a job at home, and I would start drinking at 2 pm everyday whether it was a bottle of wine or 4 caesars, and 2 coolers, this past Monday I was at a party and blacked out off of 8 coolers and a bottle of wine, I drove... my boyfriend was literally 10 minutes away from picking me up and this is when I realized enough is enough and I have to stop. I got a huge promotion and I’m going to be a manager and my main concern was how am I going to drink all day? How am I going to bring it to work in a Starbucks cup? Like no, that’s not happening. I am stronger than this. Bubbly water has been helping and yesterday I was for sure anxious but today has been the absolute worst. Not to mention I’m allergic to alcohol when I drink it in excess so I was totally covered in hives on Tuesday, it’s now Thursday and I still have them. I’m anxious, I have the sweats, I still have hives and I have a headache and I’m so fucking tired. Just wanted to reach out and tell my story and let everyone know we’re gonna make it through this.",278

I’m feeling so raw right now and clinging to minute by minute at times.

I am thinking that it’s so hard right now and I’m waiting for it to get easier and now I’ll be feeling these things to come?

I’ve got a list of things on my to-do list to keep me busy. I’m currently having breakfast and planning to hit up the gym, then go to my parents place for a few hours.

My parents house is where a lot of my drinking got out of hand. I think it’s definitely a mental trigger for me to associate being there with sneaking whatever I can to catch a buzz, and right now I find myself meticulously trying to find a way to do exactly that. 

“I can go to the grocery store and pick up a bottle of wine, but only white wine so that she can’t see my red-stained lips/teeth, and I will spend most of my time in the garage while sanding some wood pieces and upstairs at my computer transferring files. If I’m lucky,  she’ll leave the house while doing all this and I can put my guard down”.

I’m so so sick of this thought process, and I know my mom is tired of being concerned that I’m drinking behind her back. She’s going through menopause and has told me before that her hot flashes get a lot worse when she’s stressing about this. Got to the point where she said she’d get a breathalyzer so I wouldn’t drive away. 

Luckily I live with my boyfriend now. He’s been such a saint for dealing with my bullshit, and being here is much better for me in a multitude of ways. I never find myself trying to be sneaky, but today he is gone to work while I’m free for the day. 

Anyways, I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or what, but I don’t have anyone else in my life I can’t talk about this with. I wish that my brain would just focus on the things I need to accomplish today rather than constantly having to battle to resist my urges.

I tagged along to be a part of the group, and had a diet coke. This is one of the first times since i stopped drinking that I was around a group where I was the only one not partaking. All I could think about as I watched everyone else get more inhebriated, was, ""Was that how everyone else saw me?"" They weren't sloppy or rude or beligerant (like i could be at times). They just were not as in control anymore.

I am seriously considering talking to my primary care provider about a obtaining a prescription for naltrexone. I am worried about having that conversation. I'm drinking at least three beers a night and a couple of shots of whisky. My alcohol intake has really ramped up over the past few years I've had so many day ones that I'm sick of it. I've read about the Sinclair Method and it appeals to me because it seems that after awhile you dissociate alcohol with pleasure. Per my understanding, naltrexone just cuts off the pleasure ""triggers"" associated with alcohol so all you feel is sick, thus defeating the purpose of drinking. 

Anyway. Could I please get some advice about talking to a doctor? How did you go about it? How did you find the courage to reveal your addiction after hiding it?

Also, regarding naltrexone. A major reason why I do not want to bring it up as an option is that it could be on my medical record (USA citizen). I could go off on a rant about US medical system, but I'll spare you. 

How can being prescribed naltrexone affect your employer relations and future medical care?

Last night was a doozy. I was flying to see my boyfriend and decided to have some wine at the bar. Then another glass of wine, then a beer, a shot, a white claw… with hardly any food in me I blacked out. I remember getting on my flight but the next thing I knew I was in my boyfriend’s car and we were yelling at each other. 

He let me stay the night but we haven’t spoken much since last night. He slept somewhere else in the house. I did see he has opened the birthday gift I had gotten him. It’s on the counter. 

He has walked by a few times and at one point told me there was coffee. I know he’s mad and he has every right- I’m mad at myself as well. 

We’ll see how the day progresses. 

I just wish I had stopped at the beer. Or the second glass of wine. Or that I hadn’t gone to the bar by my gate in the first place. 

I know if I keep this up, I’ll lose him and that’s the last thing I want to have happen. I’ve just been so depressed living in my apartment in a state with no family or friends nearby. I don’t normally black out and these past two months I’ve blacked out more than I ever have. And it’s no longer just affecting me- it’s affecting my loved ones. 

Today I’m not drinking.


ETA: we broke up. And… surprisingly I’m fine. Better, actually. In the time we’ve been apart I took myself sightseeing in the city, and fell in love with it. I applied for an apartment and got an approval today for a move early February. I’d be closer to my job which means no more remote work if I feel like it. (And after working 1.5 years remotely with no friends or family in my state, I definitely feel like some human interaction.) Also in the amount of time since the post, I submitted my manuscript to a publishing house. I started hitting the gym hard and dropping weight. 

I didn’t realize how trapped I had felt in my relationship. I know I have my own issues to work through, but looking back on the relationship, it was toxic. I was gaslighted, I was told to not talk about my depression because he’s not my therapist and I’d get no empathy from him, I was told he’d never be able to love our kids if they had some type of mental incapacity, I was told I was a liar for not knowing what part of my job entailed, I was left crying in my living room after he made plans with me for the following day knowing he had no intention of staying and following through, I was told how much he didn’t like my dog… the list could go on.

I've always had a bit of a problem but it became incredibly bad last year before I met my now fiancé. I would drink most days, often hiding it, and I was drunk when he proposed. I'd make any excuse. Now I'm only on day 2 and I'm terrified that maybe it was the drink all along and I don't love him. He's told me one more drink and he would leave for good, but I think if we hadn't booked our wedding then I would just tell him to leave. But maybe that's just so I could drink. Has anyone been in a situation like this before?

Well... as far as my education and career. 

I left a PhD program with my masters after dealing with an *incredibly* toxic advisor. I think that kicked my drinking up 12 notches. Suddenly I was so unsure about everything, constantly berated and made to feel stupid. I had a lot of feelings of inadequacy (and still do!).

Now I'm just left clueless. Do I want to go back to school? To a program in a similar field or something else? I dont know. I obsess over it. 

I'm in my mid 20s and married. I want to move closer to my family and think about kids in a few years, and I don't think I could do school and work and kids. But the outlook of jobs with my current degrees aren't great. They're ok, enough to pay the bills, but I always wanted more for myself. 

Am I failure if I don't go to another program? Do I know what I want to do? 

*Que Harry Styles ""Lights Up"".

One thing I know is that drinking won't help me navigate these feelings, it will only make me feel worse.

We have had a really crazy week here with the kids and their antics, so the stress has been at 11.

Mind you, I still get those weird twinges in my head for ….. ??? and I am still swatting those out of my brain when they show up. 

How do I know this? We ended up going out to eat last night and the waitress asked what we wanted to drink when we sat down. In the past, I would have asked for a beer list, instead… I said, “Soda and Lime please.” My husband still drinks, so he asked for a beer list, and when it came, I gave it a once-over. Nothing looked or sounded good, even a few of my #puremichigan faves were on there: Bell’s Two Hearted Ale and Old Nation’s M 43. Nope. 

Have I crossed that magical line where alcohol doesn’t have its power over me anymore? Should I be careful and not become complacent?

Most reads have indicated a week or so. My depression and anxiety also feels like it’s gotten worse. I am having issues with short term memory and a lot of trouble maintaining concentration. I’m trying to incorporate more stimulating activities into my days but still…I continue to experience this fog. Is anyone else still experiencing negative side effects after a month of sobriety?

We started to like each other but since we weren't  boyfriends we always meet in a bar, for a drink.
We had interesting conversations and we laugh and we have great sex in is place.
That was us until 4 days ago when he left me.
Of course in the middle of this we started dating, we made a lot of really nice adventures.
We had a good alcohol, we never argue because I was drunk or he was drunk. When covid started we were spending days at home and we started to drink more, and smoking weed more.
We didn't get drunk every night of course, but almost.
At the same time we were happy!
We have nice jobs, we really enjoyed life and  each other company, spending time together was always a bless.
Some times we have some arguments, we have ghosts from the past and...who doesn't argument in a relationship tho. I never betray this guy since I was so In Love with him that I didn't have eyes for anyone. 
4 days ago he left me, he said that our relationship is toxic and he wants to move on doing is life without me.
In the argument he said that he doesn't know if he was the only one all this time or if I was having affairs with some others. Those words Hurt me so much, seeing he turn my back and go was so painful that the first thing that I decided was to suicide, but I didn't, the second was to get drunk...but I didn't...so I'm 4 days sober and trying not to mask my pain.

Hey everyone, I hope you’re having a good week.

This week I’m really grateful to have a break. I’m taking a week off work and have been taking the time to read, relax and try to recharge a little bit. I treated myself to a yin yoga session last night as I’ve been feeling agitated lately and it does help calm my mind to have a guided session. It always feels quite radical to spend time doing something beneficial for my well-being - before I got sober, all my energy went into the bare minimum of surviving. Going for walks, reading a book etc., they’re seemingly small gestures for a lot of people and yet for me they’re still massive radical acts of self care that still take quite a lot of effort. 

Today I’m going to take myself swimming and I can’t wait! I’m so thankful I get to do this little yet huge things for myself… they remind me that I’m worthwhile and that life has the potential to be good.

How are you all? What are you all thankful for, today?  Hope to hear from you!

Take care,

We're going away for my birthday as a group of friends in a week's time. I would love to drink and be part of the group in that sense - then leave the booze behind at the venue and return to my normal life thereafter.

I think I can be a normal drinker - on minimal occasions (such as vacations only). COVID turned me into a heavier drinker - but now that my evenings are full, I don't have the urge at all. That plus therapy etc., has helped.

I know this sub will probably tell me not to do it. I know I shouldn't do it - plus I really want to hit that 6 month mark. I know this is in my control. I could lie and say I ""took a weekend off"" and not reset my count, but that would be lying to myself.

Any advice or support would be great right now.

I hate to say the words but yeah I am probably an alcoholic.  Idk.  Having 5-6 double IPAs every work evening for the past 5ish years is apparently not a normal healthy thing.  

I feel like something that has compounded both the issue and my decision on whether or not to get professional help is that I have been on Adderall for ADHD my entire adult life that I have had the drinking problem.  I sort of feel like the Adderall gets me through the work day, and then the alcohol helps to chill me back down in the evening.  I can’t function without my ADHD meds.  I also feel like I can’t unwind without the alcohol.  Or idk maybe I could but I have this feeling that the alcohol is holding these demons at bay that I never want to face.

Here is the weird thing that I don’t know if I have seen from other posts.  On the weekends I lower my Adderall dose by half or even stop it.  I have WAY LESS cravings to drink but I also don’t know if that’s because I’m just too sleepy and unfocused to, or if the Adderall itself gives me cravings to drink.  Tbh I hate weekends because they are so unstructured without my full meds and I get depressed and just try to sleep through them.  

Idk.  If anyone else has any similar experiences I’d love to hear.  TBH I just feel so dumb and ashamed - I have my degree in Biochem, I really should know what these substances are doing to both my body and neurochemistry.",2

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Thursday to one and all. First I want to thank you for your comments to me and each other and apologize for some dreadful typos in my comments to you lovely SDers yesterday. I was rushed but please know I have loved reading every comment. I really and truly have. We are an amazing group of ultra kind and kinda radical folks and I am absolutely blown away by all of you. 

Now Thursday is trash day in my neighborhood. The lovely truck rumbles to get our trash way early around 5:30 am and the recycling truck comes around noon. I was thinking about all of the previously hidden trash I’ve snuck out under cover of night over the years and it feels so good to no longer do that. And it feels downright light and airy to have a recycling bin full of seltzer cans. 

And while we’ve all got physical trash and recycling to chuck, there’s also a lot of mental baggage I expect many of us can benefit from pitching. What would that be, you ask? Here are just a few ideas:
1. The thought that drinking was ever a reward. It’s instead just an addictive anesthetic. 
2. Telling ourselves that drinking made us cool. There was a time I thought this was true, but seeing folks slur words and fall down drunk just is not cool. There is no way. 
3. Thinking that drinking wine made me sophisticated. See 2. above 🤣 
4. If I can quit for a while, I’ll be able to moderate. I tried this one for well over 10 years. Moderation is an exercise in futility for me. That’s why I’m here with you epic rocking souls. And I’m incredibly grateful to know that today. 

There’s one more I’m going to hold onto. I used to think This Time Will be Different about drinking. And it is! Because this time I’m absolutely committed to pitching out drinking for good. 

I would love to hear what you’ve pitched or are planning to pitch as we kick off the day. 

Also if you have 30 days of sobriety and would like to take a turn hosting the DCI, reach out to our epic Saint Homer and he’ll make it easy for you. I highly recommend it as you’ll hear from the kindest folks on the internet. 💕💕",255

Like all that matters for enjoyment is waking up without a hangover, being able to remember events and having a couple small hobbies like working out or reading. 

Are those simple pleasures genuinely what gets people through the day? I can’t imagine myself having the drive to make it through a lifetime with only things like that to look forward to.

I dont plan to relapse on that day, I just know that it has happened on that day before. Ive said it before,, but there's just something about that 2 week mark. Its like you thinkbyoure doing well enough to slip up. My mindset yesterday was that at least I'm only throwing away 2 weeks and not more. Am I scared to succeed? If I had 2 months, would I have felt the same? I was kinda nonchalant.

I Convinced myself I deserved a couple beers. They could have been craved due to some emotional stress. My boyfriend said he didn't want to be the reason I drank, but I convinced him I have been doing good, and had a hard day at work and felt like I deserved a few. So 3 beers into my 6 pack, I went and bought a few shots of Jim Beam. I do really bad on hard alcohol, I turn into a monster, and although he didn't specifically say no hard stuff, he did say it was ok to drink a few beers if I could ""keep it to just that."" I thought he meant not to down the 6 pack and then go out for more. Anyways.... the alcoholic brain of mine didn't wanna say I was drinking due to stress from him, but I was. He just didn't need to know that. I wanted a beer, convinced him everything was OK and I was on my way! 

It feels kinda shitty throwing away nearly 2 weeks of sobriety but I promised myself that I wouldn't let it turn into a binge like I ALWAYS do. And so far today, I am back at day 1 without alcohol as opposed to day 2 of drinking. 

Mentally I've felt so much better sober, I know I don't let my sober days ever go long enough to fully reap the benefits, but I feel like if I stay on track this time around, that I haven't completely undone the work I've done these last couple weeks.

I just don't know how else to cope. I'm his sole caretaker. We also have 2 dogs and a cat together. I'm so tired all the time and when I'm not tired, I drink. When something stressful happens with the dogs, I drink. When he's in a bad mood (understandably), it puts me in a bad mood. And I drink. I don't know how much I've spent on vodka and wine this month alone...

When I was 23, I was $3k-$4k in debt from alcohol alone, during a time our relationship was on the rocks. Every time we've had a rough time together... I drink. It makes me feel better. It disconnects me.

How do I start? Can I ever? Am I just too broken right now? Does it have to be right now?

I’ve been to a few meetings. I’ve gotten my first 30 day chip was pretty nice honestly. I went to a family party the other night where everyone was drinking wine or beer and it was offered to me. I kept messing with my chip while sipping Dr Pepper and eating a few too many chips but hey, better than beer. I do miss the taste of beer but I’m not really missing being drunk, which kinda strange. First bout of sobriety that I haven’t missed being drunk.

Tonight was an incredibly stressful day at work because it was the busiest day at our donation door and I was supposed to do it all alone, despite not having closed on my own before and having no instruction on what to do with the abundance of donations and the lack of space. I just wanted to get home to my dog and fall asleep. Who would’ve ever thought?? Lol. I get home and I hurt a bit because of how much I do compared to how little I did before this, besides drinking. Guess I’m building up some strength though. I meet some people who give me that “god I need a drink to be able to stand you” but I also meet some people who I was happy to have met sober. It has been pretty good. Most of the people I work with are kind, and I love how nice they are when I’m doing something they asked me to do. I genuinely think it’s because I don’t complain or seem anything other than 100% happy to be helping them right then. 

I’ve also been on my antidepressants again for nearly a month, as well as my ADHD meds and it’s all helping. It’s helping impulsivity, my mood. I have to go through work tomorrow without my concerta which will really suck but maybe I can get it in order before I leave for work so I can pick it up on my lunch break. Seriously, Walgreens is about a 5 minute walk from my work, so it works out perfectly.

I am almost 3 weeks sober and i know that I personally find alchohol to be too good. I know I can never moderate because when I'm drinking anything I'm doing (watching tv, playing a game, watching the world go by on my balcony)  I would rather be doing it drunk. Why should deprive myself of something so good when it is legal and I can get it in 10 mins?
This is the reason my life always spirals everytime I try and moderate again because something so good is too hard to resist.
I honestly have no idea how people can moderate there drinking when they can easily have access immediately qto something so good. I have exepted I will never understand this. But that's why I know Sobriety is the only option because unlike other people I have a disease which makes me find alchohol to be too good.
There is a hole in my life now I have stopped drinking. But I know that sacrificing something that I find find be too good will lead to a better life for myself. I have to learn to build a new life around what I am missing so I can feel whole again.

 And anyone who’s struggling right now trying to get and stay sober, if I can do it, anyone can

2 years ago I was in and out of the same bar every single day from 6am to 2pm, I’d be throwing up in the bathroom by 2:30 and by 3 I’d be at another bar trying to feel better before night time where id pass out for a few hours, wake up feeling like complete ass, and be right back to the damn bar by 8pm drinking my face off til close. I don’t miss it one-little-fucking-bit..that’s not living ladies and gentlemen

What I did to become sober? What is my secret? I made myself DESPISE alcohol. I hate everything about it. I think about the worst hangover of my life and I replay it in my head whenever I think about taking a drink. And tbh, that is never. When you convince yourself something is bad for you, the brain will deter you away from it. I promise you. Remember all the times you laid in your bed spinning and said to yourself ‘after this, I’m done’…remember shaking in the morning from having that horrifying ass hangover and tell yourself that you don’t wanna feel that shit..remember puking in that bucket in the morning and shaking your head asking yourself why you’re doing this to yourself..remember hiding all those cans/bottles all over your house because you’re so ashamed of yourself. Make yourself HATE alcohol.

You got this.

I'm terrified since drinking is so prevalent in my family, friends, and coworkers. It's what literally every activity revolves around.

I always drew a hard line when it came to drinking on the job (that came into play later when I had developed my alcoholism.) Through the years I never saw a difference in how I involved alcohol with my life as opposed to my patrons. As my addiction grew into an every day affair I truly realized; something so readily available can and will ruin my life. I dish it out on the daily. 

To this day I dont understand how I can see a patron come in to my bar and enjoy a beer or two, then be on their merry way. 
I could never. 

Thankfully I drew that hard line years ago and enjoyed my slippery slope in the discomfort of my own home. I dont think I'd be able to continue doing what I enjoy so much had I not. 

Id like to celebrate my 31st day with all of you and thank everyone who has helped me in my struggles for the past month. To everyone on this sub thank you for your continued examples and stories. I truly appreciate it.

So this is how I ended up here.
 A month ago I almost died. I found some some baggies with a mystery powder while picking up trash at work. It looked like cocaine. I only have done coke once in my life and over 10 years ago. I held on to it for  about a week and I decided to try it. I woke up 2 days later in the hospital. Turns out it was fentanyl. I passed out and laid on the floor for 6 hours until my wife came home and found me purple and barely breathing I  got a ambulance ride and was put on a ventilator. Luckily I didn't end up with brain damage and I got away with only pneumonia.
I decided I needed to change my life I was drinking a bottle of liquor every week along with ""road pops"" on my why home from work. I couldn't control my impulses that's what got me in the hospital. And i was keeping the amount I was drinking from my wife. I didn't drink for a month after my trip to the hospital. Until last night I downed a bottle of gin. And lied to my wife about it.

I came clean to her this morning. I just feel like I am going to be doing this battle for the rest of my life which if I don't do any thing is going to be significantly short.

Last year around this time I had a major breakdown and made the realization that I’m an alcoholic and that my mental breakdown was due to a major bender I had do to a girl not working out. 

I went back home to my parents in a different city and got the support I needed. 4 sober days later, the anxiety had mostly gone and I picked up right where I left off when I went back to my apartment that is in a different a different city. Come Christmas Eve I have another major breakdown after a night of drinking with the neighbors and I go to the hospital for my breakdown. From there I decided I was gonna start a dry January early and for the most part I did a pretty good job. Only drank maybe 5 of the days that month. 

Well here I am a year later, back to the same habits. Having two 24oz Mike’s Harder 8% Lemonades and a couple beers until I’m tired and fall asleep watching tv. I once again had another breakdown on Tuesday and drank to get through the anxiety and fall asleep. I know I’m ranting but I could really use some help how Im supposed to do this. I am shaking and am in a cold sweat.

Edit: I guess I need to clarify but what I mean how do you do it. My life is surrounded by alcohol. On Mondays and Wednesday I have an adult volleyball league that drinks. Also on Tuesday, I have trivia  at a bar. On Thursdays, I play DND with people and we drink while doing that. And then of course, Friday and Saturday, what the heck am I supposed to do on weekends when my friends wanna go out and watch college football. And then of course NFL Sunday, I can be found at my favorite spot for 6 hours drinking “light beers”. My point is, I have good friends, none of them drink to the extent that I do by far and I enjoy the weekly activities I’m apart of. How am I supposed to continue my “normal life” when the source of my madness is always gonna be around me.",6

HOWEVER:

I'm noticing that sober, I'm more able to feel through the emotions as they happen and let it go in a more timely manner instead of bottling everything up and only feeling/releasing them when I get home. When I can work through that stuff in the moment (not saying I always can/do) I don't have that huge chunk of awful waiting for me as soon as I punch out. Which in turn helps with the cravings AND means I'm better able to relax and leave more of work at work instead of wasting my night drinking and dwelling bc I didn't process any of it at all.

I think the biggest thing that I'm really coming to terms with lately is the fact that life is more... stable now.

That's both a good thing and a bad thing. 

When I was drinking, there was three modes to life. Drunk, hungover, and sober. High, Low, Middle

When I first quit drinking, my moods were up and down... sometimes high on the possibilities of being quit, sometimes low feeling that I wouldn't ever experience the highs of being drunk again.

Now, I'm very level. Small ups and downs that go with regular life, but in general, less of everything.

This is good and bad. No mornings of pure regret, shame, and anxiety, but also no nights full of unearned confidence, feeling on top of the world, and pure bliss.

My life is less exciting, no doubt about it. part of that might be the fact that i have a toddler, part of it might be that i quit drinking, part of it might just be that I'm on the back half of my 30's and life is starting to slow down, but I'd be lying if I said the idea of having a beer or 9 and getting weird doesn't sound appealing sometimes still.

Besides that... I'm much more effective at life. I have my shit together more, I procrastinate less, I feel sharper, I'm more present, and i get things done. But sometimes i just still don't want to. Alcohol was a good excuse to say ""fuck it"" and now I don't have any.",15

Not great. Not terrible. Just okay.

I’ve spent a lot of it *wishing I could drink* (which is slightly different from *wanting to drink*; I’ll always want to drink—that’s what got me here) instead of accepting the reality of my new lifestyle and moving on.

I missed lightening up. Unwinding. Disconnecting. I missed “the good old days.”

But over the past two weeks or so, I’ve noticed a shift. I’ve figured out how to lighten up, unwind, and disconnect without my drug of choice—and wake up feeling 100%-ish the next day.

I’m coming to terms with the fact that while there was definitely some good in “the good old days,” the amount I drank wasn’t part of it.

I’m starting to feel more like myself without drinking, instead of a pale imitation waiting for Happy Hour so the booze would put some life in me. Not (as is the case since august or September) feeling like I was depriving myself of what made me *me* on days I didn’t drink.

I’m starting to feel like I might be able to move on from that version of myself. Not forget him, of course. Just move on.

Most importantly, I’m no longer bitter or irritated about spending my days sober, because I’m finally realizing I don’t *need* booze. For years, I thought I did—for one reason or another—until it became a crutch.

Then an anchor.

Anyway, just a few things that dawned on me. Been trying to be more mindful.

I wanted to share something I have no other place to share. Something so awful and ashaming, I want to erase and just...drop it here.

So I've been sober 2 years. Two best years of my life, you may know that feeling (I hope you do)

Today I heard my son's phone alarm. It's the buzzing sound I used to set at 4PM every day to arise from the dead drunk state in which I put myself to drink nearly every day for a couple years.

It was the most awful sound you could imagine. It reminded my of that nasty, smelly, exhausting time, when I thought that dying would eventually be a relief. The ritual was always the same : I bought (a large amount of) booze in the morning. Drunk it like a crazy person until 1 PM. Fell asleep dead drunk. Set the alarm 2 hours later just in time to go get the kids at school. I was fucking hammered many times on the way to/from school. I'm so ashamed of that. I could have killed us all. It's a miracle no one was hurt. A miracle my wife didn't give up. My kids survived all this madness.

Please, if you're in a similar time of your life, where all revolves around alcohol. Many of us here have been there. I know how you feel. I feel your power to overcome that. It's so incredibly good to be freed from this monster. It takes a lot of time, help, love. Go to AA, go see a psych, take a medication, talk to people, write and share your story, help someone, accept help, and just never forget one thing : Life without booze is SO MUCH EASIER.

I've always been (as I thought) a lazy slug. Alcohol felt like the only thing i was barely able to do. Felt like quitting would be sooooo hard. Impossible for me. I was doomed to be a drunk. But to my own amazement, life was so much easier sober...so so so much easier...

Just take the easy way out. You can do it. I promise you can. I promise you'll heal.",99

My parents are nothing short of amazing and I can’t muster up the heart to tell them they raised an alcoholic son, although I’m sure they have their suspicions. They don’t deserve that. I recently turned 25 and I’m afraid of the road I’m heading down. I drank socially throughout college, but it was game over the second I could legally purchase alcohol. Now, getting drunk is a nightly occurrence for me minus the couple days that comes with my attempts to quit. I recently went 5 days and the only negative effects were trouble sleeping, but that came with false confidence that I could drink like a “normal person,” and then you know the drill. I’ve read stories on this sub about people being able to refuse going back even in simply tragic circumstances, and while I am so happy for them and their strength, it just makes me wonder how weak I must be to give in for no good reason. I think I’m using it as a coping mechanism for loneliness, but that might just be an excuse. I’ve read “My Sober Mind” by Annie Grace, and that helped for a   little while but I was back to square one before I knew it.

First, found out that my divorce was finalized. The ex and I were separated for almost 7 years. At first I stayed married out of guilt, shame, and fear of what she might do. Then she came up with the idea of staying married until the 20 year mark so she could be eligible for insurance for the rest of her life. This wouldn't cost me anything financially so I agreed with the hope that it would pay off when it came time for the actual divorce. This didn't work out because while she is unemployed by choice, she continued to fight until the end for a crazy amount of spousal support. Anyway, it's over. 

The second good news event has to do with a pension program that I had filed a claim with a few months back. While it isn't settled yet, I found that the minimum amount that I will receive is far greater than what I expected. 

So, today is a great day and I am able to enjoy it sober. Just taking it one day at a time. 

I hope that you will also not drink with me today while celebrating!",12

2021-11-10 14:29:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qr24el/i_finally_feel_clear/,I finally feel clear,"I’m sober from alcohol for 10 days now, which is the longest in a while, and for the first time I actually feel like I won’t drink again. I’ve gone through periods in the past where I haven’t drank - usually a week or two. Did Sober October and Dry January in the past but more so as a way to save money/reduce excess calories around the holidays, not really concerned about any introspection about my alcohol use.

But this time this was for me. This was because I wanted to be sober and be clear minded and I know how much experience and opportunity alcohol has robbed of me in the past. Even when I’ve gone through these ideas in my head before I’d usually just get drunk anyways within a few days and stop giving a fuck again for a few months.

I think my biggest realization is how long the hangover period lasts. It’s not just the headache and nausea and shakes and shits the next day or two, but in hindsight my mind would be clouded and foggy for closer to a week before I felt on top of it again. Obviously this was met with the weekend where I’d proceed to drink again and repeat the cycle of dulling my senses.

I may not have the days under my belt that many of you have, but for those in the early stages or those thinking about quitting or taking a break, I can definitely say that it does get easier. The cravings and ingrained habits are still there, but the clarity and calm that come make it feel worthwhile fighting against them.

Im luckily enough to have some people very close to me that have shown me enough love and support and motivation to get through this. And let me tell you. It's sucked.

Depression is high. Motivation is low. My emotions are / and have been all over the place. I've yelled at my staff. There were even times I looked at my dog and felt nothing, and I hated myself for that. The most important thing in the world to me and I'm not even capable of having emotions towards her. 

I'm still Not getting enough sleep. See days I eat, some I don't. 

The first week was rough. Sweats. Shaking. That little voice telling me ""it's ok we'll try again next week, just have a couple to help you sleep it's fine, it's 3 am we could have some beers and watch YouTube and you'll still have time to make it to work in the morning""

The voice is still there but it goes away quicker and isn't as pushy these days.

Smart recovery has been really useful for me. I'm not a fan of the AA concept and for anyone who is considering it is suggest giving smart recovery a try. During my first two meetings we have discussed important aspects of your life to analyze and see where you're at and where you want to be, as well as discussing support networks, how important they are, how to be a support for someone else, what is it you look for in support? And just putting these topics out in the open is a big help. 

Anyway. I guess I wanted to say I'm doing it. But I'm struggling. But we all are. 

Transition is hard. But change is how we get better.
It doesn't get easier. You just get stronger.

I'm not engaging in constant, exhausting mental gymnastics about how I can have just one glass because surely moderation is achievable.  I'm not constantly having to stop myself from walking into the kitchen, which I know still has half.a bottle of wine and half a bottle of vodka.  Instead, I feel like my sobriety is this new jewel I have.  Like I've given myself the best gift ever. 

I feel sad for the person (me) who had so much fear and sadness that she had to drink all day every day to just get through.   I feel sad for that person who felt like she didn't fit in the world, didn't have a place in the world, wasn't worthy of being in the world.... I want to reach out and hug her and tell her she too gets to really live if she wants to.

My body is so damaged.  I haven't been to the doctor for years so I don't know the extent of it.  I know I've gained \~70 pounds in the last 3-4 years and my stomach is an enormous, bloated beast.  When I was turning my body into that bloated beast, I didn't even care that I was killing myself.  Gaining all that weight felt helpful as it gave me an extra excuse to hide inside, to be invisible to the world, to not have to deal with the specter of relationships or the challenges that come with being visible to men.  

Right now I feel tired and headachy and know that my body will need a whole lot of nurturing to come back to life.  But I'm grateful to my body for hanging in there. I look forward to taking care of my body and bringing her back to life.  I look forward to being strong and being able to be visible because if nothing else, I know I have my own back.

Right now this jewel of sobriety I've given myself is a secret gift. I live alone so it's not like I need to announce to anyone that I've made a big change.  Aside, of course, from announcing it to the whole Internet here, I'm holding the jewel close for the time being to protect it, savor it and nurture it.  Thanks for letting me safely share my secret with you.

I’ve wanted to stop for months, but fear of bad withdrawals and lack of self control with tapering meant that I had to go to the hospital for help as soon as my eyes started turning yellow. Not in great shape, but at least I know I’m not gonna die from liver failure or withdrawals like I’ve been worried about for so long.

I’ve been taking my meds they gave me and I’m honestly feeling great without alcohol in my system for the longest stretch of time in about a year. My appetite came back IMMEDIATELY. I had been eating maaaybe half a meal per day for the last like 2 months, and now I can’t stop eating everything in sight. It feels so good to be hungry again and not nauseous every day. I’m already sleeping so much better and I’m not waking up with shaking hands or horrible anxiety and panic attacks every morning. My eyes are already whiter, though they will take a little while to return fully to normal as my hepatitis heals and my bilirubin levels go down. 

There have been cravings, but they’re quickly deterred by the voice of my ER nurse in my head telling my boyfriend “this is killing her.” My cravings are coming more from the fact that my drinking routines were so engrained in my head. For example every time my boyfriend goes to the bathroom, I get the urge to sprint to the other room and quick chug from my secret bottle of vodka like I used to, but then I remember “no, that’s not what we’re doing anymore.” Whenever we play video games I absentmindedly reach for a drink that isn’t there in between rounds. I feel a bit like a toddler being told no, but I also feel like a parent doing what’s best, if that makes sense 😂

It’s my brother’s birthday and I’m going out with my family to our favorite mexican restaurant later. I know it’s gonna suck passing up that margarita, but honestly I’m just thankful that I made this decision to get sober so I’ll be around to eat their fajitas for years to come 🤤

They text you daily and you can setup various goals around controlling your drinking and generally being mindful of it. I'd post my progress if images were allowed, but suffice it to say that the service helped me get from drinking many drinks every day/night of the week (blackout/greyout type drinker) to more of a controlled social drinker status.

In the other post, I saw comments about inability to moderate. I also used to have problems with over-drinking, but the text service has helped with that too. I totally get it's not for everyone and all our journey's are different. For me, it's a helpful alternative to the all or nothing approach and has slowly taken me towards goals I've set.

2021-11-10 11:25:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qqy3lh/advice_please/,Advice Please,"First off, ignore my badge, it needs reset :(. I made it 3 years and 7 months. This past year I lost 15% of my body weight (132 -> 115 at 5’6” I did not have the room to lose weight) due to appetite issues and swallowing issues.  They found a tumor in a not so great location between my stomach and esophagus (GE Junction) and I decided to begin my relationship with alcohol again. (Luckily the last 2 months have come with some other lifestyle changes and I’m exercising and eating again and back to 132 healthy pounds.)

I did not, for what it’s worth, go into a frenzy and drink myself into a hole… I simply was tired of carrying the weight of “not being able to drink” even though it had become second nature to be sober. Part of me also wondered, why were my most physically fit years the same years that I drank too much?  I also quit weed recently for a career choice I’ve made and that was part of my ability to keep away from alcohol (still having a vice). Anyway, illogical, and disconnected from the actual reasons I quit. 

I thought I could moderate. I haven’t drank myself sick. I haven’t done anything stupid. I haven’t fallen into old traps, except for 1:  I told myself I’d keep it casual. I thought after all this time my tolerance would be gone. I’m back to 5-8 drinks a day and basically feel sober. 

My question or advice I’m looking for is this—I know I can’t moderate. The experiment failed.  Yet, I don’t know how to quit again. Last time I feel like a wave of energy to quit surrounded me. I wanted to quit. This time, I know I should, but I’m not sure I “want to.”  I’d like to change that… I’d like to be 100% clean and proud of that lifestyle but having vices and going 100mph feels like part of my “brand.”  It feels like a loss of identity. 

Sounds childish and small minded when I write this down; but I know this crowd understands the struggle.

Two weeks ago he freaked out, had a dissociative episode while drunk that ended up getting him arrested.   He was hospitalized two more times, once after drinking heavily and another time after drinking & taking a bunch of tranq's in what we believe to be a suicide attempt. 

Last night after not drinking for 2 days, he had a seizure.  He's currently being medically supervised and is on a psych hold.  No one can see or talk to him until 6pm tonight. 

In the span of 3 weeks, his GF broke up with him (due to his dissasociative episode, which scared the living fuck out of her), he lost his job and ended up staying with friends and living with him mom as GF and him were living together. 

Do people come back from this?  I'm worried he's done permanent damage to himself after the suicide attempt and I just don't know what to think about his prognosis for a future.  This is ultimate rock bottom. 

I spoke to him and his family last night on the phone.   He was going to be taken to a rehab facility this morning, but after the seizure last night he got taken back to the hospital.

Like most I didn’t become a problem drinker over night, but a little over seven years ago I found myself drinking more and more until daily. Over the years the amount I drank a day would fluctuate but there has not been a single day I didn’t have at least one drink in this time span.

As of this past weekend I was averaging 500ml of vodka a day on the weekends and 375ml an evening during the week. I was and still am highly functional and nobody, that I know of, around me knows exactly how much I drink.

I have gotten very good at hiding my addiction, still socially drinking in moderation in public but when I am alone that’s when I would hit it hard.

My last drink was at 7:15pm on Sunday evening. This is the longest stretch I have gone without a drink in seven years. Surprisingly I am feeling really great. Cravings are pretty much non existent, they only withdrawal symptoms I have experienced were early on with vomiting at about 16 hours since last drink.

I know that drinking has no real benefits for me personally and I feel so much better now that I've removed it from my life.  What really get me is thinking about future events (mostly the upcoming Holidays) and why drinking is still somehow something that is part of those thoughts.  Its not the taste of alcohol or the buzz that seems appealing its the little escape from uncomfortable situations.  Alcohol allows me to live in my head rather than in the moment more comfortably.  I've found that really slowing down and just trying to be present in situations has allowed me to not even really think about the silly FOMO aspects.  Im present and able to be more thoughtful in most settings.  I go into every situation attempting to take something away from it, be that information from a conversation or strength in a relationship.  Alcohol has always been a response to something else in my life that I  was ignoring or avoiding.  Taking small steps to address those issues has been immensely helpful in abstinence and I'm healthier and happier for it.",21

I joined this subreddit today because I want to be honest about my relationship with alcohol for the first time in my life. I have a lot of complex mental health disorders which add to the shame I'm feeling. 


I don't drink every day. I don't even drink every week. I don't particularly like alcohol or being drunk. 


But - I drink alcohol to cope with anxiety or intense emotions. I have this weird kind of social anxiety where I've overcome it to the point I function fine and I can be really extroverted and sociable, but I still *feel* the anxiety. It's particularly pronounced with new people, in large crowds, crowded or loud places. I dismiss the anxiety. I'm normal now. I can go out and drink with my friends and it's fine. 


But I drink so much that I blackout nearly every time. It's not fine. I've ruined my life repeatedly from these infrequent evenings. Ruined relationships, caused a million scenes, broken down crying hysterically more times than I've eaten breakfast, lost all my possessions, repeatedly put myself in dangerous situations in which I could've been seriously harmed. The guilt, shame and pain I feel over my own actions sabotaging my life again and again is unreal.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Welcome to Wednesday fellow Sober and Sober seeking friends. I’m delighted you’re here once again to take it one day at a time and not drink today. 

So let’s focus on some of our health wins we’ve experienced since quitting drinking. 

Confession time: when I was drinking my eating habits were frequently just crappy. I would binge eat sweets on my lunch hour (likely self medicating withdrawal as I drank every night) and then drink dinner instead of eating like a grown up. No wonder I felt like crap so often. 

I told myself to focus only on not drinking for the first 120 days. Then I added in balanced eating and it’s shocking but it’s not been that hard. I’m feeling so much more even keeled. And lightbulb moment —- it makes it even more clear that alcohol was the primary problem all along. 

In addition my blood pressure is lovely, allergies are chill, and people tell me I smell good. I’m still not sleeping but hope that will one day come as my body continues to heal. 

Yesterday a particularly brilliant SDer advised us to Be Your Own F***ing Hero and I loved that so big. By living sober and healing we are being the hero we need. 

I would love to hear about where you find your self. While I may not be able to interact as much today due to work requirements, please know I’m massively grateful you’re here and for the kindness you’ve shown to one another and to me. You are all winners in my book! 💕🍁 IWNDWYT friends!",422

**The Good:** I was so thrilled to visit my favorite paper store in San Francisco, where I bought some Japanese ethereal paper for my collaging.

**The Bad:** At the request of my brother, I went to visit two of his friends—a married couple. After a while, the woman asked me, “Do you have a neurological problem?”

“Yes, I have multiple sclerosis,” I told her.

“You look normal, but I could tell something’s up by the way you walk,” she told me. “I’m a nurse,” she added.

This bummed me out. I am usually very open about having MS, but it’s something that I prefer to disclose (or not) as I choose with strangers. I’ve always told myself that I can fly under the radar if I want to—but apparently not.

Also—I thought that we weren’t supposed to make negative observations about other people’s bodies. Didn’t she get that memo?

I knew I needed to quit drinking and for awhile I did. But inevitably I went back and since then this subreddit has constantly reminded me I need to quit.


So I took the plunge.


Cold turkey. I cant wean myself off it. Ive been either drinking or smoking weed daily for several years now with very few days off. It got so bad Id wake up 7 hours before work just so I could smoke or drink. I quit weed awhile back. Joined r/leaves and have had great success there. 125 days and counting this streak and 123 days last streak, with only 1 time smoking breaking those two up.


The problem is, as I succeeded with weed, ky drinking got heavier and heavier. I was drinking several times a day, even grabbing some booze from the gas station on my lunch break so I could drink in the parking lot before going back to work. Enough is enough, and Im serious about quitting alcohol now. If I can do it with weed, I can do it with booze.


Im on day 5 of quitting. Im using the app Sober Time to keep track. Its pretty nifty. Today I am craving incredibly hard. My routine is to stop by the gas station after work to pick up booze and then drink it at home every night, so not doing that has been challenging.


Luckily my lack of weed smoking has left my head clear and Ive cone up with a solution. I will only carry my credit card and or money with me when I have specific plans to buy something (like gas for my car or food). That way, even on days like today when all I can think about is drinking, I literally can not buy booze. No buying booze on the eay home means no drinking booze when I get home.


Im hoping to check in here regularly, and I am shooting for great success. It will take time, but I know I can kick this stupid, money sinking habit.",6

In the last hour of work, and the first hour after work all I could think about was stopping by the store for a bottle. I took the advice I always see on here. I took a walk still in my work clothes down a local trail by the office for 30 minutes, and decided I was hungry. I stopped by the store not for alcohol, but for pizza and a flavored tea. Then I went home. I have a short commute, so the walk was good to clear my head in between work and home. I also texted my SO, who has been begging to be included in this for years, how I was feeling. I got down to about 30 percent of where I was craving-wise and got on with my day.

I never really considered myself a ""problem drinker"" as ive maintained a full time graduate degree program, a part time job and a part time internship for my degree. So I just always gave myself the excuse that alcohol wasn't getting in the way of my goals.  Recently I've just been feeling so fed up. Tired of feeling like crap, looking down and wondering where the 20 extra pounds came from. I think I'm finally ready to truly change after many failed attempts. I'm getting married in a year, and regardless of the weight gain or even looking unhealthy, I want to enter this marriage emotionally and mentally healthy. 

My biggest challenge is this reward system I place around alcohol. We all know the feeling; incredibly hard day or even just a long day at work there's always the drink to look forward to at home. I don't know how to break that feeling at the end of the day that I'll be able to have my reward.

Here’s how i did it (long),"I drank nightly for 12 years. Some nights much more than others.  Over those years i was every type of problem drinker at one time.  I started going out to bars at 21 and traded weed for alcohol like flipping a light-switch.  Initially it cured my social anxiety and shyness.  Not after long though, i was drinking heavier and stumbling home in an emotional stupor every night, drunk-dialing and texting friends, girls, family members. 

At 22 i broke my shoulder riding my bike home drunk, and while healing (and still drinking, even though i didn’t have money for my bills- i still don’t know how i afforded to still drink every night), i started looking up definitions of alcoholism.  Every time i took an online test, i checked every box.  This was the first point in my drinking career that had me wanting to quit.

At 23 i met a girl who quickly made me want to go to the bars less and less.  Instead of every night, I’d go out after work two or three nights a week with friends. During this time, though, i still continued to drink at night, usually alone, after she fell asleep.  We moved in together the following year.

At 28 my long-time employer went out of business, and I’d also gotten my driver’s license and my own car, which all resulted in me not frequenting bars at all.   I would buy a handle of whiskey once a week and make myself cocktails at home every night.  As the years went on, i found myself needing more and more every night. 

Turning 30 was a dark turn for my drinking.  I started blacking out almost every night- not remembering brushing my teeth before bed, but knowing that i had by the toothpaste stains on my pants in the morning (early afternoon).  All the while, i desperately wanted to quit, but couldn’t foresee just how i possibly could.  

The blackouts got more frequent. I stumbled into bed every night, often waking up my girlfriend.  I rarely remembered what movies or shows I’d watched the night before.  The hangovers became unbearable and unrelenting.  

I woke up to at least a dozen rock bottoms in those years that i won’t get into, but all of them aside, what got me where i am today was a simple, excruciating hangover.  Every hangover i woke up with had me thinking “this is it, tonight’s the night i won’t drink”, but i always knew i would and i always did.  This hangover was my worst in years and it came out of nowhere:  the night before, I’d eaten, I’d had enough water. Sure, I’d drank half a bottle of gin, but there was nothing out of the ordinary about that for me.  

I should pause to mention that sleep has been an issue for me since childhood.  Before booze, weed helped knock me out before bed, and since weed, I’ve relied on booze to lure me to sleep (along with everything else). This is another in a long list of reasons why i thought it impossible to quit drinking- i hadn’t fallen asleep sober in 16 years.  

The day of my awful hangover, i decided to really try and stick to the plan and not drink that night.  I knew that the prospect of falling asleep sober was too daunting, so that night- i just didn’t sleep.  I suspected I’d be fully capable of staying sober while awake- and so rather than force-drink until i was tired, i just stayed awake, all night and through the next day. The next night, i was so tired and sleep-deprived that i hit the pillow and fell asleep instantly.  Right there i had 2 days sober.  They were uncomfortable days filled with anxiety and irritability, and my sleep was spotty and almost feverish, but i was able to power through it.  

My third day sober i went to the pharmacy and bought every non-habit-forming sleep aid i could find.  I’m now nearing 50 days of sobriety and i have absolutely no desire to drink, ever again.  Those irrational desires still come up, often, but the benefits so heavily outweigh the alternative.  I’m turning 33 in a few weeks. I’m now married to my girlfriend almost 10 years.  My life has never been so good.  My general anxiety has improved in ways i was never able to achieve in any other way while drinking.  I look forward to sleep every night (albeit still with sleep aids, for now). 

I hope this can help somebody out there.  I never thought I’d get out. Years ago i accepted an early demise if it only meant i could keep drinking.  Now i find myself making plans for a future i never used to imagine existing.  I realize my path to sobriety won’t work for everyone, but i can finally relate to all of those who gained so much from getting there.  I hope the same for all of you.",240

the first week or so was great. my drinking substantially reduced within days -- i don't know if that's placebo or not but if i'm drinking less, i'll take it. i was getting a bit tired sometimes but overall no major side effects.

after that i start getting this weird feeling i can't describe. 10 days ago was when i started feeling really really shitty and it hasn't gone away. i get moody (or no mood at all), i'm extremely tired most of the time despite having slept fine at night to the point where i cannot keep my eyes open halfway through the day. everything still works down there but my actual desire for sex is pretty low. i just kind of don't really give a shit about anything. i was so concerned with all of this that i even got a full blood panel done (vitamins, hormones, CBC, cholesterol, liver, etc) to make sure everything was ok, and there's nothing out of the ordinary. literally the only culprit is the naltrexone. i don't see what else it could be.

i'm posting this instead of calling my prescribing doctor (psychiatrist) because she isn't covered under my insurance and will demand i pay her $200 for even just getting on the phone to talk about this with me.

it feels like the brightness of life has been turned down. sometimes i feel great but most of the time lately it's been terrible and i just want off of this stuff. yes my life has improved in many aspects by drinking significantly less.. i'm down to like 3-4 beers a day which for me is a miracle but is really not worth it if all i wanna do is wait for each day to pass.

I'm closing in on 40 and for several years I managed a venue which definitely solidified my status as a 'problem drinker'.  I would drink at work and then stop by the bar for a few on the way home, sometimes not knowing how I got there or where I left my car if I was with people who insisted on calling me an Uber.  Some of my lowest points involved blackouts where I screamed at people, nearly cheated on my husband, fell and hurt myself or cried in public.  I couldn't dig myself out of the hole no matter how much I wanted to and no matter how scared I was by my behavior and inability to control it.  I gained weight and hated what I saw in the mirror.  I even quit for eight months and after losing a lot of weight and having people tell me left and right how happy and healthy I looked I went right back to drinking out of a fear of missing out.  It was a huge mistake. Right before the pandemic hit I got a DUI.  Thankfully, it wasn't on one of my bad nights and I had 'only' had something like three drinks so I barely blew over the limit.  I was given the fine, diversion, I lost my license for a month and had to have a breathalyzer installed in my car for six months.  That was two years ago and now, after the isolation of Covid life, depression after losing my active job and social world, inactivity and leaning hard on booze to cope I'm now bigger than I've ever been and more depressed and low than at my very lowest.  I don't black out anymore but I drink a ridiculous amount of vodka in the evening and I am to the point where I'm just sick of myself.  I want to love who I am again and to be the optimistic person I used to be.  I cried all day and talked to my husband, who is wonderful, about how I need to change and how I can't be a 'normal' person who drinks.  Today is day 2 without alcohol.  I'm doing this for my health, mental, emotional and physical, to be here for my family.  To not be embarrassed by who I am anymore.  I feel grateful that I'm in a place where I'm not living a lifestyle that will make this more difficult, although I know it will still be hard.  But at the end of the day it's harder to stay fat and unhappy, to ever get another DUI, to eventually have my children lose respect for me.  I'm going to choose the easier of the two hard choices and stop drinking.",133

I think a lot of being sober is finding out the person you are without alcohol. I really don't know her yet. For the past 14 years I've lived on alcohol fuelled from one night to the next. Alcohol has always acted as an armour for me that i felt necessary to socialise, or be intimate or be honest. I wouldnt be open to meeting new people unless I had the defense of alcohol. I never felt comfortable. It'ss been a constant through my social life. Now I'm tryna figure out who I am without it.

My best mate and roomate recently told me I have been a bully in the past, arrogant and cruel. And there were times she wanted to drop me as a friend. I'm trying hard not to follow my instincts which is to get angry at her for not telling me this at the time. For taking my companionship while resenting me. But I realise now I probably have to accept I've been a pretty shit person the last decade. Alcohol has made me selfish. And I hate so much that my obsession has prevented me from doing the things I've wanted to in my life. I suppose its not personal though. It's affected my relationships to. If I'm angry at myself I'm sure others have a right to be so aswell.

I was totally unaware she felt like this.

I also dont want to totally blame alcohol. How much of my behaviour is me and how much the drink?",9

In the last 2 years, I...

* Got on medication / consistently went to therapy
* Gained back my mental health, piece by piece
* Repaired my relationship with my long term SO (we are now engaged!)
* Started going to the gym
* Got back to a healthy weight (I'm 5'7"" and during the worst of it, I weighed 105 pounds because I just wasn't eating. I now weigh 118 or so. Might not seem like a huge jump to others, but it's a big deal for me)
* Moved to a city I love near my family
* Got a Big Girl Job with an amazing salary
* Paid off ALL my credit card bills and student loans (I am now DEBT FREE!)

I'm kind of emotional looking back at where I was versus where I am now. If you had told drunk me this is where I'd be a few years out, I literally would not have believed it. My drinking only (""only"") lasted 3 years or so, but things got very bad very quickly. I was frankly living in a state of despair. I was frozen in misery and could not see a way out of the hole I'd dug for myself. 

This is not to say my life is perfect--I'm still working on raising my credit score, I'm looking to get a my own place in my new city (currently staying with family), and I haven't had the stability yet to adopt an animal (my beloved kitty passed right after I stopped drinking).

However, I know myself, and I can already predict that in a few months, years, whatever, I’ll have the “All of those bad things that happened in the past are long gone, I’m so much better than that now, I can start drinking again” and then ruining my life again. I’m trying to do everything in my power that I can right now to prep for that moment, but I feel worried because when I was quitting hard drugs, I went cold turkey and happily quit for >3 years before I used a tiny amount again one night out of the blue when I felt comfortable with my life, career, relationship again etc. It was a one off, and I sure as hell won’t be doing that again, but I feel like I can’t trust my future self.

Everyone else in the house wakes up at 4 am. Dogs go crazy, no one will calm them down. As soon as everyone leaves it calms down until theyre back. 3:30 every day, here in a few minutes actually, the house is gonna turn into a circus of dogs barking and people yelling at said dogs. This goes on until about midnight. Every day. 

I know it's not my house, but I pay to live here. I've asked politely if we could at least try to teach the dogs not to go crazy in the house all the time. It would be good for everyone involved. A lot less aggravation, more sleep, and better behaved dogs. But for some reason, that just can't be allowed. 

Not just that, but many, many other problems. To the point that I think they want me out. I don't know why, I sit in my room all day everyday, never in anyone's hair. Buy my own food and stuff, I pay rent. I'm literally a nonexistent, completely out of the way source of income, so I don't know why I'm getting pushed out, or if it's just all in my head.. am I the problem, probably.

So there's me venting my dumb problem. One that would be solved if I could get my head out of my ass and stop being a drunk. I added it up, $400 a month on drinks. That's enough to pay for a good portion of having my own place. That's the trade I'm making. It's so dumb.",22
2021-11-09 15:27:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qqchd8/meditation_was_the_answer/,Meditation was the answer,"I am an alcoholic, have been for over a decade. Tried most things to quit, which have all failed. This includes going to AA meetings, getting a sponsor and doing the 12 steps, going to alcohol detox, self-harm and suicidal attempts, getting into supplements, getting addicted to exercise instead, eating a healthy diet, going on acamprosate, going on naltrexone, joining sobriety communities and blogs (such as this one), etc.

Today marks about a year since my serious depression and deliberate heroin overdose. And it was only a couple of weeks ago I was abusing alcohol and other drugs daily and was feeling deeply unhappy, alienated, anxious. Yet like the addict I was, I believed I would be happy ""if only"" I could find the perfect drug to ""cure"" me.

A year ago I was also addicted to exercise, running 100km a week on average, as well as heavy weight lifting. While exercise alone may work to help some people quit (more power to them), it only served to worsen my mental health. Why? Because I was exercising for entirely the wrong reasons - to push myself and to prove myself to myself and others, instead of being content with who I was. It involved a constant attitude of judgment and condemnation on myself. I ended up getting seriously injured with  bone stress, at any rate, so had to quit for five months. (Later I realised my addictive nicotine use was probably a main contributor to the bone stress, and I've been four days off nicotine so far).

I've always been a spiritual person and meditation & Buddhism have always interested me; I've meditated on and off for the past couple years but never kept it up as a consistent practice, even though I know how amazing it is for my mental health (funny how we tend to avoid doing the things we know are good for us). Deep down in my unconscious mind I knew I needed to return to meditation again, as this was an emergency of my soul, and coming across [this wonderful eloquent book](https://mindfulness-in-plain-english.github.io) was the impetus I needed to launch back into consistent practice.

I have been meditating every day for over a week now and found basically immediate relief of my cravings. Whenever cravings do come up, I am able to perceive them for what they are, know that they are temporary and will pass, and not react to them in a negative way. My birthday lunch was a few days ago, and my mum without fail always buys us alcohol, yet I only had maybe half a shot worth and had absolutely no craving to drink any more - even though I was not on naltrexone (anti-craving drug). 

Like running, I've found that meditation becomes much easier over time. When I first started running I struggled to complete a hilly 6km course, but that difficulty completely disappeared in about two weeks. The same goes for meditation; I used to struggle sitting for ten minutes, but now I can sit for 50 minutes easily. And now I look forward to my sittings, instead of dreading them. Now I also make an attempt to bring the mindfulness from my sittings into my daily life, so that I am present 24/7.

My primary goals are to extinguish both **craving** and **judgementalness**. Both of these phenomena are the source of my suffering, and are unnecessary. As I said, I see this as an emergency, a matter of life and death. Because, after all, I probably have a maximum of 60 more years until my death to become reconciled to the facts of my existence. I have no desire to be walking around in a fugue state, fighting my inner cravings and judgments, constantly living either in future fantasies or past rumination. What a waste of my limited time here before my complete annihilation. I only have 60 years to become okay with the cessation of my consciousness, so only 60 years to extinguish my craving for physical immortality. I am not being morbid but stating facts. 

If meditation was an antidepressant or anxiolytic, it would be called a wonder drug. But because big pharma can't bottle it up and sell it, it's largely ignored as the solution to the mental health and meaning crisis we are having today. Better yet, meditation is completely free and you can do it at home alone, without any involvement of other people. You are expected to see and know for yourself, rather than taking the word of others that it works. I for one will continue to practice mindfulness to hopefully one day reach the point where I'm emancipated from my cravings and judgmental thoughts.",19

For full disclosure I also have borderline personality disorder, but I used to drink a lot and I never noticed it before I started, that I had these symptoms.

She nodded and continued the rest of the questions. I was *almost* deflated there wasn't more of a response.

When she was wrapping up with scheduling for next year she slipped in ""you seem much happier than the last time I saw you."" 

**Confetti!** It was really nice coming from my doctor. Especially because I do have anxiety when I go to the doctor for any reason. But I WAS a memorable wreck the last time I was there. *(suicidal depression and anxiety)*

I am much happier! Over a year sober and fully in the realization that alcohol did not help my anxiety or depression. It's still a battle, but much easier without the falsehood alcohol gave me.

And this morning I feel off. Not hungover but I notice it in my mood, my ability to focus. I feel down and it's difficult to get into my work.

This is why I need to cut it out entirely. I don't binge like I used to and it was the psychological effects after decades of struggling with alcohol that finally got me to take stopping seriously. The depression and anxiety and fear that would hang on for days after a binge. Taking at least a week before I could start to feel normal again.

But here with just two beers I can still feel it affecting me. Maybe because I'm more sensitized to it. Kindling and all that.

Maybe it's like AA describes it, an ""allergy"" of sorts to alcohol that some of us are prone to.

I haven’t drank in 3 days but I’m still reeling from the black out and hangover on the weekend. I hurt people around me and embarrassed myself so badly. I don’t remember any of it but from what I’m told it was awful. Do you have any advice for getting over the shame? 

A little more background on me.. I’m new to this sub. I am in my early thirties and have struggled with occasionally binge drinking to the point of blackout since I was a teenager. It has gotten much less frequent over the years and I can go periods without drinking or just socially enjoying a drink or two without issue. But every now and then (maybe once a year) I accidentally overdue it and black out. Which results in me embarrassing myself and being extremely sick and depressed for days after. 

Enough is enough. I don’t feel that I’m dependent on alcohol but I know I can’t risk this happening to me again. I’m ready to make the lifestyle change and lose friends if that’s what I need to do.

It’s been 3 days and the anxiety is still crippling. Any advice as to how to stop hating myself is appreciated <3

My wife, my therapist/group, and this little corner of the interwebs!

My overarching lesson is that sobriety and recovery aren't just quitting drinking. It's so much bigger than that. Quitting anything is a subtraction. And yes, that's where recovery starts, but it gets good when you start adding.

For some, I suppose life just goes on. For others, you get back to whole again. And for still others, life gets better than you could have hoped. I sometimes feel guilty (not really though!) that I got so many bonuses out of the shit I went through--and put others through. But it's a fact, the lessons I have learned in recovery have touched every part of my life, and now fairly late in the game (I'm 55 next month) my life is better in all regards.

To that end, I completely lost and sense of satisfaction in my old career (IT & software middle management). After taking some time off, getting some education and certifications, I started a job as a recovery coach last week. I'm actually dispatched directly to ERs all over my city, and I meet with folks at their worst, who are looking for a better day. My job is to learn a bit about them and plug them into the best treatment option. I then follow up with them for six months.

It's really intense and almost overwhelming here in the early days. But it's mission driven, and for the first time in 30 years, I have a job that makes my heart beat a little faster.

Personally, my issue is that I've always had this mentality of, I'm going to do what I want, when I want, I'm an adult and I make my own decisions. So then if we just don't have booze in the house, I do what I want, and that's to hop in the car and go get some. I'm not sure how to put a stop to that mentality.

My partner is very time motivated, he doesn't like his time wasted. So his issue is essentially just having it in the house. If we didn't have any and I wasn't willing to go get it, he most definitely would not waste his time going to get it.

Boredom isn't too big of an issue, we both have plenty to do, but it's just easy to think, wouldn't this be a little more fun if we were drinking too?

This post is already getting too long so I'll stop there but I'm happy to post tons more details if that would be helpful to anyone. We're really just looking for some advice on our specific problems. Everyone's journey is so different but maybe some of you can relate.

eta: I don't feel like I added enough info. To clarify, the only reason we drink is to make things more fun, and also bc of the habit of it. We go to the kitchen together and goof off for a few minutes, maybe some hugs and kisses, then take a shot and go back to whatever we were doing, usually individually. We both have fine jobs and don't bring stress home, we have an amazing relationship, money is no issue, etc. We don't want kids.

Other than a handful of years over 20 years ago, for the past 32 I have been a drunk. For the past decade and a half, it was BAD.  I didn't think it could get worse, then the pandemic hit and holy hell.  It was to the point I was drunk all day, every day and having blackouts more days of the week than not. 

Today is day 14, TWO WEEKS, completely and totally sober. I know it isn't long, but I truly didn't think I would last past the first couple of days before caving, so I am wicked proud of myself. 

I have had a really good friend for about 16 years; we are so close we consider ourselves brother and sister.  For a long time we worked festivals together (I was a bartender at a pub, he was in an Irish band that played there) and to say we drank together all the time would be an understatement.  It was part of that world, and we shone bright.  I haven't seen him in person in years since we live on opposite sides of the country.  

He surprised me a couple of days ago by coming to the town over for a job so I made my first official trek out into the world as a sober person to go visit him at the resort he is staying at.  Picture palm trees and tiki bars, the kind of place that even people who don't drink would have a few just because. Though I wasn't positive how strong I could be, I love this person so much I HAD to try.  

After I got there, we walked through the resort to find something to eat and landed at the tiki bar.  When we sat down at the bar, he very quietly asked, ""Are you okay being here? Will it be too hard, because we can go somewhere else.""  THAT is a good friend. The kindness and respect was more meaningful than I could ever express.  Imagine two Irish folks who could each down their own bottle of Jameson whiskey together, and well...this was kind of a big deal.  

The barkeep asks for our drink order, and I PROUDLY said, ""do you have any cool mocktails? I am sober.'  No hesitation. No shame. No embarrassment. FULL OF PRIDE, I said I was sober.  Fuck that was empowering.  We got a couple of mock Pina Coladas and sat and talked for the longest time. The barkeep came back a few minutes later and asked me how many years I was sober. I replied with 13 days.  She hooped and hollered, gave me fist bumps and congratulations and was all around amazing.  She asked my brother if he was drinking mocktails in support, he replied that nope, he was also sober since Christmas. We three sat and happily chatted about sobriety for a while.  

Guys, it was so easy. At no point did I even entertain the thought of a drink.  At no point was I tempted. I had SO much fun.  We laughed, we joked, we sang, we picked on each other.  ALL the things and high energy we would have done if we were drinking. I mean, we were hardcore drinking buddies so we had a lot of experience with how we are when we are drinking - and nothing changed.  There was no loss in fun.  In fact, we had even more because we could remember it.  lol  We talked for hours about our experience with sobriety and what led us to it. He shared his wife is also sober now.  I realized that I was just as fun, quirky, out-loud-laughing as I would have been with that horrible social lubricant.  The only difference was no alcohol.  

I had about 40 miles to drive back on the way home, and I smiled from ear to ear the whole time.  I caught myself squealing from joy a couple of times, and then had a small cry and a few tears that popped up out of nowhere.  Tears of joy, of relief, of hope, and from knowing deep in my soul that I've got this and that I don't ever have to feel the way I did when I was drinking.  That I don't have to hide behind masks anymore. That radical honesty is the way to go and it is FREEDOM.  

I am FREE!  I know two weeks isn't much, but I haven't been sober for two weeks in over two decades. 

I'm going back to the resort today to spend a couple of days with my brother. My daughter and grandchild are joining and we are all going to have a mini, alcohol free, family vacation. My daughter doesn't drink (the only thing I got right in life was knowing I had a problem and breaking the chain of abuse - of all sorts - with my own child.  She has never felt the need to drink and I am wicked proud of that. Even drunks get something right every now and then. lol)

If you got this far, thank you for letting me share.  Again, I know two weeks isn't much; but today it is everything to me and I am so unbelievably happy and relieved and joy filled.

I know I cant do this anymore. I was gonna type a list of reasons but the big ones right now are that I cannot be in a relationship while I am drinking this way. Been way to long since I was close to anybody. And I will never leave my job that I hate and try and find a new one while I am drinking this way.

2021-11-09 09:01:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qq4bba/quick_question/,Quick Question,"Hey! I’m on day 17, and it feels so good. After my (31F) last escapade with drinking, I thought I had lost my family for good. I was kicked out of my mom’s house, was punched in the face by my younger sister, bouncing from hotel to hotel, and was afraid to call my aunt who is like my second mother until about day 4 or 5 of being sober (she hasn’t had a drink in over 30 years, and has been extremely angry and upset over my relapses [as someone who truly cares about another person usually is]). I moved back into a sober house I was living at over the summer, just got a job after 5 months of collecting unemployment, broke up with a guy I met in rehab that was just bringing me down & who’s finding loophole ways to still do drugs, and I’m really starting to feel so much better about myself and about my situation. The depressed state I was in after spending a week in a hotel room, drinking Jameson around the clock because everything seemed insurmountable, is finally fading, and I see the light at the end of the tunnel. My mom even said that after a year of being at the sober house I can move back in to get back on my feet, financially.

So that’s my story of the last few weeks of hell I was in due to this terrible, terrible poison. As I said, I’m living in a sober house, and as such we have random urine tests done. This isn’t a problem for me, as I’m not the type of person to risk the situation by drinking (nor do I feel the same desire to drink here, as it’s about 30 min from where I grew up/lived my whole life, and I don’t feel the same people, places, things triggers), but for whatever reason my ETG (alcohol) lines are always extremely light. Last night, the line was so light that it was almost not even present. I’m wondering if anyone has any ideas as to why this could be. Could it just be that I’m drinking too many things with sugar in them, and not enough water? Any advice would be helpful, because obviously that’s not a great look. The house manager is super chill, and he trusts me, but it still doesn’t make me feel good at all.

I’m 24 and my drinking has evolved into problematic bingeing since the pandemic, and on top of that I’m an angry and unpleasant drunk. I decided to give Sober October a go and I started off doing okay, I got to 14 days and then I decided to drink again.

I went on binge after binge, every week I’d get a few days sober and then I would drink heavily for days and black out. This continued through the end of October.

I was fired from my job on November 1st for an incident relating to drinking. I didn’t get caught drunk on the job but it also wasn’t my first drunken incident. When that happened I said I was ABSOLUTELY DONE with drinking, that’s it’s ruining my life and I just need to quit for good. I even managed to get a couple job interviews lined up for later that week. And then I decided to drink AGAIN!

So here I am, on November 9th, coming off of that week-long bender. I missed every job interview I lined up because I was too drunk. The shame and embarrassment and anxiety is really deep this time. I feel like somebody reached down my throat and scooped out my insides, leaving a hollow shell behind. I hardly remember anything, I don’t know if I embarrassed myself in front of any neighbors or did anything cringey. And I live alone so I can’t ask someone about my behavior.

I’m really struggling to bounce back from the shame and anxiety and embarrassment from these binges. I absolutely cannot keep doing this anymore and making myself feel so low for something I really don’t enjoy anymore. I’m really ready to throw myself at this fully, so here I am

2021-11-09 06:00:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qq1a8g/the_fumble/,The Fumble.,"In American football, when your team “fumbles” to the other team, it is the most pejorative of words and situations. 

The irony in the story to follow is that we so often label the word “quitting” - in all cultures - in the same way. When it comes to alcohol, we flip this script so beautifully. The quitters are the winners. 

And my son, the fumbler, is also about to turn the word fumble on its head as well. 

Allow me to elaborate…

For the American, red-blooded classic male (read:  former Me), Sundays are for beer, snacks and FOOTBALL!!  We are talking hours (wasted literally and figuratively) on the couch - watching the pre-game, then our team, then other teams for Fantasy Football purposes.  This has been my ritual for years.  Even on beautiful fall days in the Northeastern USA.  I gasp horridly at the amount of time and beautiful afternoons I’ve frittered away…

Recently, during this new season and my sobriety, this has changed dramatically. 

So when my sons came to me the evening of this past Sunday to go outside and play OUR own football game, I didn’t hesitate.  I hit the power button and shut it all down and jumped at the opportunity. I was to be the “automatic” QB - pitting my 10 and 7 year old boys against each other. You could cut the suspense with a butter knife!

Deep into our game the score was 28-21 with my eldest in the lead - and he had the ball. We had already proclaimed this was the last drive of the game because my youngest boy’s hands were cold as the sun had settled down the horizon, allowing for the crispest of autumn evenings. He wanted to simply quit because he knew he had little chance to win and the idea of some hot cocoa by the fire seemed much better to him.  Hard to argue such sound logic. 

My 10 year old, not one to turn down any competitive situation, looked at me and said with a big smile, “I got this Dad.”  I figured he meant he was going to score one last time - and quickly - so we could all get some collective warmth. 

On the first play, I dropped back, threw the ball and he made a wonderful catch with his arms outstretched, grasping it with his small but deft fingertips. He then, rather than run straight to the wide open end zone for a game ending and winning touchdown, fumbled the ball. 

On purpose. 

My wide-eyed 7 year old picked up the ball and raced to the opposite end zone. It ended the game in a in a miraculous 28-28 tie. The neighbors are likely still discussing it. 

We went inside and my youngest recounted his heroic play to my wife and we all enjoyed the incomparable warmth of “home” this time of year after time so well spent outdoors. 

My son had quit and fumbled on purpose, and I had gotten the chance to witness something that former me would have definitely missed whilst consuming mass quantities of beer and watching a meaningless game of people I don’t know play a game that has literally zero impact on my life. 

Late that evening, while putting my son to bed, I praised him for his preciousness and kindness towards his younger brother.  He smiled and utterly stunned me with the exact thoughts dancing in my own head since the end of our game when he said, “I guess it’s the right thing to quit on purpose sometimes, right Dad.”

Indeed my precious child. Indeed.",88

Then, one breakup and a few months of miserable and escalating drinking later, I managed to stop for nearly 3 months. I wanted 2021 to be a sober year, but something triggered me again and I couldn’t stay sober for more than two weeks at a time. I must’ve gone through withdrawals about a dozen times, but I relapsed each time despite fresh memories of how much they suck.

So last weekend, I went to stay with two friends (a couple) who are some of the last people I haven’t hurt by being a drunk. First it went well - they were understanding about the accommodations I needed during withdrawal, but something inside me snapped eventually. I could hear my inside voice screaming “don’t do it” as my hand went towards a bottle of wine that was not mine. I could hear my inside voice saying “you’ll regret it” as I drank it.

My friends noticed - one of them wanted to have a glass after a day of hard work, and there’s an alcoholic in the house, so it’s not rocket science to figure out what happened. I apologized and they tried to be kind about it, but I could tell they feeling angry and disappointed as the atmosphere stayed sour. I felt terrible all night, even suicidal. Luckily I know how to manage those feelings most of the time.

I damaged the trust of some of the last people that I haven’t pushed away yet. And it feels awful. If I drink again, I will probably hurt another person I care about, and I’m not sure I will survive fucking up like that again.

So I will be going to AA once again tomorrow, as well as telling my therapist what happened, and getting back on the train. Because this is no way to live.

A few early changes for me:

(1) My mood is much better these days! After drinking, I would be hard on myself, grumpy and not nice to be around. I would feel guilty for those who had to be around me when I was like that. This would usually be the case from Monday to Wednesday after which I would start to feel better and start getting ready for the next weekend binge which is crazy.

(2) I feel like I'm doing a much better job at my work. Similar to point 1, my work would be effected by mood and tiredness at the start of the week.

(3) For the first time in years I'm back in the gym doing a regular programme which I'm enjoying hugely!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Welcome to Tuesday fellow SD Sobernauts. I’m thankful for every one of you and have loved reading your comments 💕. Today I’d like to share some tools (in addition to this sub) that have helped me amble down this road for several months now. 

1. Podcasts that aren’t specifically sober but where folks talk about their sobtiety — several different ones time and again helped me think - maybe I Could do that. Then there was one that recommended Belle Robertson’s blog Tired Of Thinking About Drinking. I signed up and read some chapters which lead me to want more …
2. Annie Grace’s Naked Mind book and podcast. By explaining so clearly the impact alcohol has on the body, she removed the shame and really helped me get unstuck. I’m a fairly logical person when I’m sober, so reading about how our bodies can begin to heal made it clear, I want that. 
3. Catherine Gray Unexpected Joy of Being Sober. Catherine’s book tells her story and also shares oh so much well researched information about the drug that alcohol is. She also pulls no punches telling her story and made me snort laugh. Love it.
4. The I Am Sober app. I think it’s free. It includes a counter, daily motivations and pledges and I use both. I heard about it from someone on here who was 2 or 3 years sober after drinking for 30 years. Man but I love this sub. Folks are so darn generous 💕
5.Gratitude journaling. I try to write down a handful of things I’m thankful for every day. It’s proven to help our moods, so what have I got to lose, right? Anyway I like it and frequently this sub makes the list (along with husband, kiddos, dog, and the sound of wind in the trees 🍁)

When I quit I didn’t tell anyone but my husband right away. Was so afraid I’d fail yet again. But after a few weeks I worked up the courage to make a Reddit and post here. Man did that feel good. Like I was coming out of hiding. And it consistently continues to help. Now I’ve let most friends and family know. And I’m looking forward to seeing where this journey leads me. 

Today I’m grateful for your kind words to me and to each other, for delicious coffee,  my body’s ability to continue to heal, and for future  opportunities  to serve as we all make our way forward. 

Please know you’re all rock stars in my book, because you’re up for this radically beautiful sober life 🍁💕. IWNDWYT dear friends and I’m oh so thankful to say so",340

2021-11-08 22:44:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpuzui/first_vacation_with_no_hangovers/,First vacation with no hangovers.,"The past year, I’ve been more mindful about how and when I drink (as a result of covid, a divorce, cultivated self-awareness and some brutal, multi-day depressive hangovers). I’ve taken weeks at a time off, and I still drink occasionally, but have been able (and want) to stop after 2 or 3. 

About a week and a half ago, I was flying home from a draining work trip, about to start a week of PTO and celebrated with way too many drinks in way too short of a time, right before a flight, which doubled the drunkenness. I learned the same lesson again, hating how I felt and acted, but ultimately it made me approach my vacation differently. I didn’t want to feel that way, I didn’t want to be that person. I didn’t spend time shaming myself like I would have in the past. I just made the decision to move forward differently.

So, for probably the first time in my adult life, I didn’t start my vacation with a day-drinking bender by the pool. I didn’t use a nice dinner and night out as an excuse to get fucked up. I didn’t use alcohol to shortcut into my more sociable self when I spent time with new people. I let me be me, I didn’t try to change anything, and I relaxed naturally. I still drank some (baby steps) but I never wanted more than 2 drinks and I feel proud of that. It has been one thing for me to punish or limit myself, but another to just, be less interested. This sub and all the stories and support I see every day has helped my perspective. Thank you.

I’m not sober yet but I’m on track to a healthier relationship with alcohol and myself. Cheers to that.",9

2021-11-08 20:40:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpsqr7/achieved_my_own_level_of_rock_bottom_on_saturday/,"""Achieved"" my own level of rock bottom on Saturday","It's been about 42 hours since I took the last drink I remember taking on Saturday. 

For context, I've made unsuccessful attempts twice this year to quit, making it 2 and 3 months respectively. I caved during my vacation to Chicago during Labor Day Weekend, and lured myself into a false sense of security because I managed to not overdue it at all during the trip. I thought that maybe I had finally achieved control and could drink responsibly like other fortunate members of society. 

Wishful thinking.

As soon as I got back from Chicago, I resumed my habits of drinking from after work Friday until Sunday, telling myself it was ok to wind down after a long work week. I was back in the same cycle of feeling happy while drinking, and feeling terrible about the fact that I had drank, both physically and mentally.

Now let's get to rock bottom.

Saturday night I went to New York City to meet up with a good friend of mine for some food and drinks in Ktown. He was running a bit late, so prior to that, I met up at a pub with another friend and had about 4 beers in about an hour and a half. Once my original friend arrived, we walked to the bar/restaurant we wanted to go to, and proceeded to order some more beers. Then we ordered some soju(we were in Korea Town). Then we ordered jaeger bombs. Then another one for the road, as my friend wanted to go downtown to a bar he'd heard about. When we got there, he said beers were on him since I had just paid for the meal. At this point, I still feel okay. I have a good buzz going, might even be a bit drunk, but nothing unmanageable for me.

Then we did another jaeger bomb, and ***ALL*** 3 kicked in at once.

The last thing I remembered is my friend saying that you said this rounds on you, handing my credit card to the bartender, getting it back, and signing the receipt. It was about 1:30 AM. Then, the next thing I knew, it was 4:30(and Saturday was Daylight Savings, so the clocks went BACK an hour), and I'm in an Uber going to the train station. My face, hand, and knee are all scratched up, my entire body hurts, and I had NO idea how it happened. Based on the locations of my injuries, the fact that I still had all of my belongings, I assumed I tripped and fell somewhere. I still have no confirmation of what actually happened, since I was by myself it seems. My education guess is that I attempted to walk all the way from downtown Manhattan back up towards midtown near the train station. Why did I walk? Fuck if I know. Clearly I didn't do a good job of it.

I had lost about 4 hours of my night that I had absolutely no recollection of. Not a single detail. And to me, that meant enough is enough. We've kept pushing and pushing the envelope over the years, relying on the sheer dumb luck that nothing bad had come from my excessive drinking. It's been almost 2 full days and I still can't process that I could have literally gotten myself killed and not even know how to happened.

I'm so sorry to myself. I've been mistreating myself for far too long. Today is the end of day 2. I want to get this counter up as high as I possibly can, and even go beyond that. If I don't stop, who knows how many more days I'll have left. I can't have a healthy relationship with this substance, and unfortunately, it took this awful experience to realize it.

Thank you if you took the time to read, and I can proudly say, IWNDWYT.",43

I'm currently facing the biggest cause of my alcoholism: unfathomable, incomprehensible sadness, at one o'clock in the morning, when the rest of the world is asleep, I completely fall apart 

and I'm having therapy, and I'm sick of it, and I'm exercising regularly, and I'm sick of it, I'm journalling, and I'm sick of it, my loved ones all know and help the best that they can, and they would never admit it, but they'll end up fucking sick of it 

I'm so unbareably sensitive. Emotionally,  little taps feels like broken bones. Molehills feel like mountains. I'm so fucking sick of the sound of my own crying, I'm so fucking sick of myself, but there's nowhere to go. I'm eighty something stupid days sober, so there isn't an off switch. There's no hazy half consciousness or reduced experiences. 

I feel everything, and it's so painful, and it's so late at night, and I'm so lonely. I would rather die than feel this pain. But I couldn't die, so I drank. Now I don't drink, it's just... me, and this pain. And another sixty something years ahead. I feel nothing but pain, and now, dread.

And I can't check myself into a stupid mental health clinic or whatever the hell that looks like without sabotaging both my employment career and my university career. Even if I was willing to sacrifice them, you only get mental health clinic care in the UK if you try to kill yourself. And... even if I checked in, ruined my apprenticeship and my career, would that make unbearable late night sadness go away?

I wish there was some way to make this feeling go away. I wish alcohol worked, I wish any of the countless antidepressants I've tried had worked. I would trade off all the empathy, intelligence, creativity, humour and kindness for level of emotional stability that I could cope with.

So I want to be sober but have no idea how to do it around my friends and family.

I very proudly turned 7 years sober a few months back (still blows my mind btw). Sadly I don’t remember much of my late twenties when my addiction to alcohol took complete control over my life. I mean, I remember that my world centred around where and when my next drink would be. I remember puking every morning. The pounding headaches. I remember waking up with the shakes so bad that I needed to use both my hands to pick up a cup. And having to take shots of whiskey every night just to fall asleep, then again every morning to “normalize”. I remember being in debt. Clammy hands. The sweats. Random mystery bruises and injuries. I remember having to carry vodka in my purse as a security blanket, and secretly spiking my drinks throughout the day. I remember the physical pain I started feeling in my liver, and ignoring it. I remember the worry I instilled upon my loved ones. I remember not remembering the night before. The mental anguish. And I definitely remember crying behind closed doors because of what I had become. I was in complete misery.

If any of that is familiar, I’m here to tell you it doesn’t have to be that way anymore. I don’t care if you’re in your 60’s and think you’re a lost cause, or in your 20’s and just starting to realize your own self-destruction. It’s NEVER too late to reinvent yourself. My life was a fucking mess. And although it’s far from perfect now, I’m happy. I’m healthy. I wake up early in the mornings, stretch, meditate and sip on tea while the sunrises. Me! I workout. I have a Savings Account. I remember concerts and movies and weddings and what I did last night. I’m studying again to better my future. My parents and loved ones aren’t worried about me anymore. And I just love being alive! I’m so grateful every damn day that I’m free from the shackles of hell that I was living in for so long! So do whatever you have to do. Get rid of all the booze in your house right now, don’t think twice. Go to a meeting if that’s for you. Eat all the ice cream. Go for walks. Read books on self-love and growth. Lift weights. Practice mindfulness and/or meditation. Cry through the fear and discomfort. Just put the fucking bottle down! A better life is awaiting you, I promise. You have no fucking idea how cool it is to be on this side and sharing my success story. Never in my wildest dreams could the old me have imagined myself here. And you can be here too! But you need to stop making excuses and start right now. Enough is enough already! You’ve had a good run, time to start making lasting memories and living a life to remember! Be your own fucking success story so you can so proudly come on here and inspire others to do the same, instead of just reading other people’s successes from your couch and wishing it was you! I know you want it, that’s why you’re here! I truly hope you all find the courage to dig deep and take control back over your lives. And when you finally do, I can’t wait to hear all about it!! Much love and best of luck always on all your journeys!❤️",843

I just want to share my story and what led to me coming here. 
On Halloween weekend, I went to a party at one of the frats at my college, sipping on a large bottle of vodka, and smashed a few beers while there. My gf at the time was there with her best friend, and I said hi, gave her a hug and kiss, and just chatted with her briefly. We went our own ways at the house and later met in the atrium of the house. Later on that night we separately ended up at another house and I saw her in the other house's basement. I went over to talk to her and in the process of reaching past someone to get to her, I had no idea how much force I was exerting and punched her in the face, knocked her over, threw someone else across the room, and left after getting yelled at to leave. I was almost blacked out and didn't realize what was going on -no justification for it at all, but I just thought I'd put out there where my head was at the time.
The next day I was devastated after being told what happened. I haven't attempted to contact her and will not. It has ruined not just my relationship with her, but several other friendships between myself and mutual friends of ours. 
Now I am suspended from wrestling in our upcoming tournament and have had a pretty sad birthday. I just hope leaving her alone is enough. All my booze has now been dumped down the drain, and I am trying to improve myself so this mistake is never repeated.",6

Fast forward...

2 months ago, I married the love of my life. 1.5  months ago, I ticked over to the second half of my 30s. Today, I celebrated my soberversary by slogging through the first day of a full time job in a field I actually want to be in (and I am mentally wiped right now, lol).

That's not meant to be self-congratulatory. I still have a hard time thinking I deserve any of this, especially when I remember the person I was and what they did before November 8, 2015.

I slipped/relapsed a week or so go, things have spiraled since then.

Small history. Tried everything in my life, AA, rehab, naltrexone, etc. My one saving grace was Antabuse, something I couldn't drink on (I tried myself once and ended up in the ER). I'm ready to get back on the Antabuse. I took it for about 6 months and did the rest of the 7 months without it because I felt so good I didn't even think about alcohol.

One night a week ago I had the most insane urge and succumbed. Worst mistake of my life tbh. I was ecstatic I made a year, just can't believe how easy it was to mess it up in one night. I'm at the point currently where I've been hospitalized in the past week, blacked out a couple times, and am sick of all of this again. I wake up aching and twitching.

I'm just trying to make it those first 24-48 hours without a drink so I can take the Antabuse and start getting back on track. I'm scared to take it before that cause last time I ended up almost in the hospital due to the leftover alcohol in my body. Any advice on how I can push through these awful couple days will be appreciated (especially from people who've taken antabuse). I'm ready to feel wonderful again.

I keep reading here as a lurker to try to push through the hangover pains I'm having so I can get back on the wagon. Thanks everyone who listens and responds.",8

I'm now sixty days clean and sober, by the skin of my teeth, after ten years of binge drinking a minimum one bottle of wine per night.

I was trapped in a loop where I'd go cold turkey for a week, then lose a fortnight to heavy, relentless drinking. I'm in Melbourne, the most locked-down city in the world, and my day drinking was beginning to impact my work (and was certainly impacting my health). 

Each time I relapsed in to drinking, I drank more and more, trying whiskey, ouzo, and other hard spirits (including finishing a bottle of whiskey in one day, right before my moment of realisation). I recognised that I was on a path to complete destruction, but I was unable to break this vicious cycle... until I realised something that snapped me out of it.

During my last binge, I'd been catatonically drunk for seven days, but I knew I had to finish drinking on the Thursday night so I could sober up and drive on the Friday. This was standard practice: every time I relapsed, I drank until I HAD to sober up. If I didn't have to drive somewhere, or see somebody, I would just keep drinking. 

And on that Thursday night, as I was gurgling down my last bottle of wine, I realised that I was yearning to finish it, I was craving a clean mind and body. I was excited about being sober. I was positively giddy and relieved that I couldn't drink on Friday. 

That was a staggering realisation. Why was I drinking? Why was I forcing alcohol in to my body? I didn't want to. I was having acid reflux. I hated every gulp of wine. I was bloated, and sick, and constantly dizzy, I was disengaged with my wife, family and friends, and I knew that being sober was the right thing for me. I just couldn't break the cycle... until that moment.

Since that Thursday night, I've rode that wave of realisation in to sixty days of sobriety. Every time I feel like a drink, I force myself to remember that moment where I was desperate to sober up, and channel how pathetic I felt then in to how strong I feel now. 

Some days are breezy, other days are tough. But I will not drink with you today. And I hope this helps.",66

One thing that always pops into my head when I’m feeling positive is “How long will this last? Am I manic? Is this feeling even real or just me lying to myself?”

But I never question the lows. The lows are very real, I am a sad and broken man.

I remember reading it late at night and feeling incredibly hopeless. By that time I had finally decided that I was sick of drinking, but could see no end to my struggle.

That night I opened a blank doc and started writing my own aspirational 1-year update, hoping that if I could at least pretend there was a free, happy, healthy version of me in the future, I too could one day post it for real—could broadly celebrate my sobriety without fear that I'd backslide and have to take it all back. I never finished writing it.

I am so proud to be posting here today. Part of me doesn't believe it has only been a year since I quit. I feel like a completely different person—not without struggles or despair, but certainly without the engrained belief that nothing will ever change. I owe the hope I have for myself and the deep compassion I have for every struggling person on this planet to this wonderful place. Thank you all for sharing your stories and your wisdom and your tenacity in face of the darkest parts of living. I have my life back and can't wait to see what's next. <3",26

Reduced anxiety.

My sobriety always being the topic of conversation when going out with friends.

Living in a society built around the drinking industry.

I've been diagnosed with depression, insomnia, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder/PTSD (to me it is mincing words but one of my healthcare providers says one and the other says the other I just try and survive my panic attacks).  I am currently going through the process to be evaluated and diagnosed/treated for Adult ADHD. I also have alcohol abuse disorder (I'm an alcoholic). 

My best-friend of 20 years died in May. This best-friend officiated my younger brother's funeral back in 2016 who died of alcoholic withdrawal. I left my job and industry of 10 years in early October because I could not handle the stress of my toxic boss. I have a small toddler. I am currently doing gig work from home stuff and working on a novel to pay my bills. I have never worked remotely before. I may be slightly stressed by my decreased social interactions and lack of rigorous schedule by leaving my job even though it was net good for my mental health. The last time I left my job (2017) I went on a bender and it was actually the reason I sobered up so I acknowledge that pursuing my dreams may also be a giant trigger for my alcoholic devil on my shoulder to speak up.

Anyway, very recently I've been in an incredibly dark headspace and it just kind of feels hopeless. I have increasingly dangerous/bad thoughts that I want to do something about it but I'm not sure which of those above items or some sort of unpleasant venn diagram might be the root cause.

So I am currently doing the spaghetti against the wall of - stay sober/attend meetings, eating healthier, avoiding caffeine, I don't smoke, practice mindfulness/meditative practices, started BuJo, increasing exercise, taking vitamins/fish-oil supplements, trying to do pleasant activities, organize my life and.... I'm spiraling. 

I don't know if it is just my alcoholic brain trying to push me into drinking in an effort to ""feel better"" or if it's one of the other items I mentioned. 

I guess I just want advice. Thoughts. Perspectives. 

1. How do you tell if it's your brain trying to get alcohol or if it's actually something else...?
2. Does anyone have any other ""spaghetti against the wall"" overarching good things to do?",7

It had been a very long time since I had been in a restaurant. I has already decided, despite my SO having offered to make the event an “exception”, that I wouldn’t drink. Once we were in the restaurant however, I found myself without an appetite and more or less internally obsessing about ordering a drink. I ordered food anyway and focused on our conversation, letting him know how I felt but not lingering on the topic. Made it through without drinking.

Sort of an opposite situation yesterday. SO and I were arguing, viciously at some points. I was very angry and crawling out of my own skin. I left the house to get away from him but with nowhere to go and nothing to do. Parked outside of a liquor store, I sat completely indifferent go the idea of throwing away my time sober. 

For possibly the first time, I “played the tape through”, as some say. If I drank, it would feel like relief at first. From there the fighting would likely get worse, a lot worse. I’d probably spend the evening crying and raging. I might drive away if I got upset enough, and I’m ashamed to admit there is even a chance I’d have ended up somewhere I’d regret- if I didn’t end or ruin my own life or the lives of others on the drive there. Even best case scenario I’d end up staying home and having to endure a hangover the next day. 

I drove home, amends were made, and we had a calm and lucid evening. 

So not drinking isn’t a decision that I made once, but I decision I’ve made many times and one I will have to make again another day I’m sure. These situations were good practice for me to draw upon in the future :)",11

Amazing what a good buzz and a sugar high will do to erase a day's worth of exhaustion. While I easily could have gone to bed at 9pm I tortured myself by drinking ""just one"" which became ""just a six pack"" and then sometimes ""just another half (LOL full) bottle of wine. I would tell myself that it would be in bed with eyes closed by NO LATER THAN 11pm, which would turn into I SWEAR TO GOD MIDNIGHT AT THE LATEST, and then at least 1 or 2am or maybe even not remembering stumbling into bed even later than that.

Every single day when I woke up I vowed that I would make different choices that night. I was exhausted, knew I would be exhausted for most of that day, and would finally end the sleep deprivation cycle. I would even tell myself this night before, as in: TOMORROW will be the day I GO TO BED EARLY and get a full night's rest. Yet that tomorrow never came, rinse and repeat.

The freedom to do other things in my evening and to go to bed as soon as I tired is one of the best parts of the new lifestyle. And every aspect of my life is better because of it. IWNWYT",138
2021-11-08 15:16:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpm4v1/hospital_update/,Hospital Update,"So a couple days ago I (23F) posted that after 3 years of making my way up to drink half a 1.75 of vodka a day, I started turning yellow, especially in the eyes. I had other symptoms for months that I ignored, but that’s what scared the shit out of me and made me go to the hospital. I was diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis. My doctors were kind of shocked because of my age, and very firm in saying that this is going to kill me if I don’t stop now. If I do however, it’ll repair itself and I should be just fine as long as I stay away from booze make some other healthier lifestyle choices as well.

My blood test results were pretty insane. Bilirubin was at 4.2 (!!!) and a bunch of other stuff was way out of whack. They only kept me one night to monitor my withdrawals since they ended up being mild, and I was able to check out the next night with some new meds to help the rest of the withdrawal and healing period. 

The whole experience was a huge wake up call, for the last year or so I’ve been terrified of quitting because there was NO way I was going to seek expensive and embarrassing medical help, I really thought I could just taper off on my own. Nope! I still don’t know how much this is all going to cost me, but at least it won’t be my life, and that’s all I care about at this point. Lately I’ve been apathetic about whether or not I even cared if the alcohol killed me soon, I don’t know what switched in my brain but I know I’m not gonna let alcohol win and I know I want to live the long life I have ahead of me.

I’m only officially 2 days sober, but this is the best I’ve felt mentally in a long time. It’s that “pink cloud” and I know it won’t last, I know there will be days where it’s really hard, but right now the world seems so much more beautiful to me. Colors look brighter, food tastes better, I woke up today and was actually happy about it. I’ve made it a great and productive day so far, and I’m just sooooooo pumped to get my shit together. Alcohol has ruined my life and my health for the last 3 years, and I’m feeling optimistic about starting my climb up from rock bottom. I lucky have an amazing support system at home, and I’m thankful that there’s communities like this where we can share with and uplift each other. 

If you’re debating going in for medical help, I strongly encourage you do. It was the smartest choice I’ve made in 3 years. It’s scary, I was having a full blown panic attack when I got there, and left crying tears of joy. You’re worth it. You’re loved.

I´m writing this in humility and awe over the community that has kept me safe, in honor of all my brothers and sisters in arms, wherever you are, and in thankfulness to my wonderful SaintMarge, that sweet little normie. Life may not be perfect, but it´s mine and I´m present in it. I love you all and know that I root for you in your quest for a better life! You do have what it takes.

I’m posting this list at all my major milestones, because the tools are still the same, and maybe there´s one or two in there that can help you too. Here we go:

* Step out of the shadows. Posting, commenting and being part of the community changed everything for me.
* Set a goal. One hour, one day, one week; this trip, that visit - and count your victories! Then you know you can do it the next time too.
* Moderation doesn´t work. I tried it for ten years, and it only made me miserable.
* HALT. When I crave, am I really hungry, angry, lonely, tired? Staying one step ahead with some water, fruit or a snack has helped me a lot.
* Play the tape forward. What happens if I take this drink? The next hour, the next day, the next week? For me, drinking is not just about one day of hangover - it is 40 days with that voice in my head.
* Learn your triggers. Want a drink? Take a step or two backwards and see what just happened. Then, try to avoid it. It takes time to create new patterns, but it works. Knowledge is bliss.
* Allow yourself to mourn the losses. For me quitting was like the long and painful breakup with the love of my life. The abusive, self centered love of my life.
* Discover new joys. I´ve always loved fresh roast, hand brewed coffee; now I love it even more, especially with the sunrise through my window.
* Afraid to fall? My motorcycle teacher taught me that if you stare at an object in the road, you will hit it. Look where you´re going, not where you´re not going.
* Did you fall? Don´t despair. Get up. The failure isn´t in falling, it´s in not getting up again.
* Love your evil twin. That version of you that didn´t turn out like you wanted? Don´t shame it or hate it, pour love into it, so it can heal.
* Struggling with motivation? We all do. Go for resolution in stead. Motivation shifts, resolution stays.
* Impatient? Waiting for that spunk, clarity, weightloss, zen born again bliss peace of mind? It took time to get where you are. It will take time and work to become the person you want to be, too. But you know what? You are already on your way, and that´s your doing. You can do this.
* Stressed out? Inhale grace, exhale gratitude.

2021-11-08 14:10:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpkqr1/8_days_and_counting/,8 Days and Counting,"Hi All,

Just wanted to give a hello to the sub and tell a little bit about why I started my latest abstinence.

Over the Halloween weekend I drank at least 12 beers and 2 750 ml of bacardi...I have a big binging problem. No matter what it is, when I do it I go all out. Usually I would drink every 2nd day at least 600 ml of 40% liquor but that weekend it was Friday night, Saturday morning and the rest of the day, Sunday morning and the rest of the day...woke up Monday with such bad heartburn and pain in my abdomen. Not sure if it was acute pancreatitis but it scared the hell out of me and I could feel it for 4 days. Drinking all that bacardi straight probably didn't help...

Anyway I had really bad anxiety for the rest of the week and it's still lingering of course with this being the longest I havent drank throughout 2021. Last year I decided to stop drinking in June and it wasn't easy but by the end I was afraid to have even a sip  because I knew that would be the end of my abstinence. Christmas came around and I had a few alcohol filled board games with the family and that set off an alcohol fuelled 2021.

I've been having strong cravings....it's hard not to stop at the liquor store when I pass by it...but I notice exercise helps a lot. It puts in my mind the idea that I don't want to waste the workout and also I know I wouldn't work out for days afterwards.

The oddest things give me cravings too. I was playing a Nintendo game earlier and this guy was passed out saying No more drink....no more drink......and I got the idea to run to the liquor store and get some brandy. It took some self-convincing NOT TO DO THAT. It is crazy how the littlest thing can set it off...

Anyways...I found during my abstinence last year that these 2 mantras really helped...

1) 1 drink is too many, 12 wont be nearly enough

2) First the man takes the drink, then the drink takes a drink, then the drink takes the man

Whenever I wanted just one drink or felt like drinking anything I would focus on these thoughts and convince myself that it would be a bad idea.

Cheersing my green tea and honey to everyone here. You're all so strong and I am proud to not be drinking with you all today. This is such a beautiful community and reading all of your experience is so helpful. We are not alone 💪",11
2021-11-08 14:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qpknfy/2_days_down/,2 days down!,"Well, I've done 48 sober hours. Honestly, I think the only time I've done that in recent memory was when I had a vaginal infection & was put on antibiotics where I couldn't have alcohol for 7 days.

Here's what I have been feeling/doing/observing: 

-On night 1, I accomplished SO MUCH. I did all the little apartment DIY projects I'd been wanting to do for weeks. I cleaned. I vacuumed. I edited and finished a bit work project I'd been sitting on forever. Maybe it was the Monster energy drink I had in place of a Tom Collins??? Lmao 

-both days, I have woken up feeling downright CHIPPER. Like, didn't even feel like I needed coffee. Jesus christ. 

-adding on to that last bit, I keep finding myself feeling *euphoric*. Is that normal? Is that common? Idk! But it SLAPS in the best way. 

-Last night, a friend asked me to go out with them for our local jazz night at a hockey bar. I fucking love that bar and I love that music. But I said no because I knew, even if I didn't drink, I'd spend the night bitter and jealous of everyone else around me who was. 

-I am increasingly anxious about when I inevitably *do* have to go out, because in the punk scene, all the shows are at dive bars. I love music and my friends, but I don't want the temptation. Sigh. How have y'all navigated *not* becoming reclusive when sober? 

-I told my mom about all of you here & how helpful you are. She told me she was so proud of me. I keep thinking about her saying that, which helps me stick on the path.

Almost everyone was drinking lemon drops, mojitos, bloody Mary’s, etc… and her friend even asked me “hey, aren’t you gonna order a drink? My fiancé said he will cover all the drinks”. Sidenote: every time she would come over, I would make a dark n stormy or my own tequila cocktail I had concocted.

It was difficult, especially since they wouldn’t be on my tab, but I politely declined and just said no thank you, and she gave me a surprised look and said “oh, okay then” and that was that. And honestly, it was a great feeling getting that look and no judgement or pressure of saying cmon, just one.

So I'm trying that now. I'm only committing to today, and hoping for a month, but I've made it a week so far, and it feels pretty good.

I'm lucky - I didn't drink heavily enough or often enough to put myself into withdrawals. Honestly, though, one of the biggest benefits I'm noticing is that I have so much more mental space than I do when I'm trying to drink moderately. I would spend so much time trying to decide when to drink and how much to drink. When I decided to just let go and drink however I wanted to, I would inevitably spend a lot of time the next day regretting those choices.

All this to say, for me for today, the choice to just not drink gives me so much more space than the constant battle to moderate. I'm grateful for it, and I'm grateful for this space. IWNDWYT.",3

I don't know how those two days ended up being the ones.  They just have been and it's been a nice change from drinking every day for a while.

Unfortunately abstaining or having less for a few days has always led to a Sunday afternoon or evening binge drinking episode.  This weekend was no different as I was having difficulty processing emotions from the weekend and felt like I had nowhere to go and nowhere to turn, so I went to the bar, because that's logical apparently.

5 mixed drinks and 2 beers later I got an Uber to McDonald's for some takeout and then ran into a friend who I used to go to college with.  We hadn't seen each other in years but she picked up right away that something was wrong.  I brushed her off and said I was fine but we chatted for a bit.  Then I Ubered home, ate the McDonald's and passed out on the couch until 2am.  I thought my roommate wasn't coming home until this morning but I heard him emerge from his room a bit ago so he probably saw me passed out and snoring/drooling whatever.

I'm so sick of these ""episodes"" for lack of a better term.  I hate feeling this way and I hate the hangovers, but it's like I don't know how to respond properly so here we sit.  I need to get back in the program I think.",11

November 2020, My girlfriend of 6 years left me and moved to Texas with her father because I had a really bad drinking problem.  We kept a good friendly relationship this entire time. 

I stopped for 3 months and then feel into a deeper hole. Then July 2021 came around and an old buddy of mine moved in. I had my alcohol consumption under control. We worked out for 3-4 months. I had a good relationship with my girlfriend who moved away. Then I hurt my shoulder. And had to stop. I'm still out of commission to this day. 

She recently came to visit In September. It was the best week I had in a long time. 

As soon as she left I was distraught again. I feel into a deeper hole. The last few months I've been on benders. I'll drink Sun-Thursday and then waste my weekend sleeping. I work a 9-5 M-F. I keep up with my job, finances, and priorities. I even invest.  But nothing beats the sweet taste of alcohol. It helps drown out the sound of the world. Makes me feel good. 

Now I've been sober for about 4 days and I'm ready to break again. The love of my life has decided that it's time I stop waiting and move on. She wont own it but it's highly suggested. I know my chances are extremely low of us being together. I have the money to move down to her but I don't want to put that pressure on us. It's obvious she doesn't want me anymore otherwise she would be for it right? 

I have no hate towards her. I'm jealous of her move and happy for her. I wish to do the same one day. Uproot my life and spread my wings, change career paths.  I currently have no family members left in the family tree. I feel forever lonely because of that simply fact. I have no family. My ex was literally my world. Her family was mine. I have my roommate (best friend) and a dog (the ex has in Texas). 

I have an opportunity this thanks giving to go and get Chyna (the dog) from the ex. I don't think I can handle it considering my current state. All i want to do after work in go buy a Pint of Vodka and a tall boy and go game on my PC. (it doesn't sound bad) But I feel like besides the 3-4 month stint i did working out this whole year I have just been sleep walking alcohol. I really understand how this is an addiction now. 

I'm not in a good place. Any advice is appreciated.",13

My life has drastically improved over the last few months. I moved to a new state, became a homeowner, started a lot of hiking and biking, etc. Owning a house gives me plenty to do when I'm bored. I feel very little pull to my old DOC - nitrous oxide.

&#x200B;

But I've been drinking! I watched post season baseball all the way through the WS, mostly alone at home, with at least a 12 pack each game. Once the WS was over I was like OK, no more excuses to booze, let's get back on the wagon. Last night I went to check out a comedy club, and just completely let my guard down. Had like 4 cocktails and a beer, and then I drove home. I wasn't blackout drunk but I definitely should not have been driving. I woke up today hungover (ugh cocktails), not super engaged to work today (I work from home).

This morning I got on an early AM zoom call with the local AA club. I haven't been down there in person yet (moved here about 5-6 weeks ago), but I think I'll go after work. I'm not a huge fan of AA, I've done the 12 steps and don't really feel like doing the whole thing again, getting a sponsor, etc. My longest dry spell from alcohol was about 2 years, and I didn't have a sponsor nor did I attend much AA. I wasn't truly sober though, since I was using N2O somewhat regularly through those years.

Now I'm just ready to put all of it behind me. Badge reset. My new city has a sober gym that also puts on outdoor events like hiking, and I much prefer this to AA. But it's clearly not enough to keep me sober. I plan to get back to the gym on Wednesday since they require 48 hours of sobriety to attend.

I really want to be sober, but it’s so hard for me not to give in. One minute I’m ready to be sober forever and the next minute someone asks me to get a drink, it’s like all of that goes completely out the window.

I’m now in an intensive outpatient program and within near 4 weeks have my own apartment again, my fiancé is slowly coming back around and I feel good. I moved 300 miles away to a metro area and it’s improved my QOL immensely. It’s a small start but the fact that I decided to take this journey is impressive to myself. 

I’m worried and scared to ever go back to that dark hole I was in. I almost lost my family and the love of my life, I’m going back to school in January only taking two classes so I don’t overly stress myself out. 

I’m glad I found this sub because I’m in a new place with not many friends. My fiancé will be moving in with me after a couple months stay at her friends. (Yeah I ruined our plans to move after inpatient with my relapse)

There’s so much more to this story. If anyone wants to talk feel free to reach out. I’m going to try attending meetings etc to reach a sober network. Another reason for joining this sub. 

I’m worried but happy. Alone but feel better than I have in years. I’ll try to keep you all updated. Thanks for reading.",13

I can’t believe 5 years have somehow already passed since I decided to sober up from alcohol.

5 years ago I had been in rehab for 3 months and then went to a halfway house for another 3 months. While living at the halfway house, I relapsed but didn’t tell anyone. After I graduated from there, I moved to a new town where I didn’t know anyone and lived in a sober home. I had been out of work for 6 months and got a job at the same company, Domino’s, just at a new store.

I still kept relapsing every couple of weeks until November 7th, 2016. It was the night before the presidential election.

I went out and bought a liter of gin, and hid it in my backpack to carry back inside. I spent the night drinking the whole thing, even though I knew I had to work at 9am the next morning.

Somehow, in my drunkenness, I woke up to my alarm and knew if I didn’t show up to work again because I was too drunk, I’d be in trouble, so I made the oh so wise decision to get dressed and drive to work. I have no recollection of this.

I vaguely remember setting up the makeline. When my coworker Paul came in, he could tell I was not myself. He told me to just go sit in the office until my other coworker showed up at 11 to drive me home.

Apparently I sang to Justin Bieber on the drive home, but again, I don’t remember this.

What I DO remember is waking up later in the day in my bed, in the dark, with my room smelling like piss and my pants were wet, and I was confused as to why I wasn’t at work like I know I should have been. I remember laying there ashamed as it dawned on me that I had driven, drunk, to work and got sent home by my coworkers. I remember laying there afraid that I was going to be fired for showing up under the influence. I remember worrying I was gonna get kicked out of my sober living house and have no where to live. My mom wouldn’t have taken me in. My dad wouldn’t have taken me in. I didn’t have enough money to rent an apartment. And I was powerless to alcohol.

I laid in bed sobering up, trying to just get back to feeling normal. I watched as the presidential election passed and saw Trump was elected.

I don’t know what was different about that day, but it was the day I vowed to my soul that I was done with alcohol for good.

I walked back to work that night to see my boss and told her what happened that morning. She said my coworker covered for me and told her that I went home “sick.” She appreciated me confessing to her and said as long as it never happened again, she wouldn’t fire me. I placed $30 in my coworker Paul’s box because he covered my shift even though he’s a delivery driver, so he missed out on tips that day.

And then I just focused on being sober, being to work on time, and paying back my dad and stepmom for the money they spent covering my rent while I was in rehab and a halfway house.

I bought a fuckton of ice cream and hung out on here. And I just kept stringing the days together.

My life’s not perfect by any means, even after 5 years, but I know that if I still drank, it’d be a lot worse off than it is. I probably wouldn’t have lived past 30. Or worse, I’d still be hurting my family with my alcoholism.

I feel myself distancing a bit from them, as i find it hard to deal with the fact that they are so blind to it (although i used to be the same). I also don’t really feel supported by them (they completely minimalise it for themselfs and therefore also for me). It makes me wonder if alcohol/drugs was the only thing that kept us together.

By way of background, I've never been a steady drinker. I'm someone who is missing that ""switch"" in my head to stop when I start. If I have one or two drinks, I can stop (though I am left wanting more). If I have 3 or 4, the ""switch"" dissappears and I will drink to (quite often) black-out. I have embarrassed myself and my wife more times than I would like to admit, and that feeling of waking up and not remembering how I got to bed and what I've said or done is the most painful, cringey thing that I shudder even thinking about it.

I've spent the better part of my adult life telling myself that I can have this under control, playing the russian roulette of making it through a few social functions without issue, getting emboldened that I have finally figured out how to control this, and then getting blotto and waking up with self-hatred and feeling like death.

So this weekend, I really had a craving, and went so far as to pour a small glass of whiskey. I really thought about why I wanted it. Then I looked at my sober tracking app, came to /r/stopdrinking and read a few posts that really hit home. I poured that shit down the drain and walked away to play with my kids.

Thank you so, so much. This community is amazing. I am scared, though, why that craving came on like it did. That was the first time in 90 days I even got that close. Anyone else have this? Is 90 days when things start to get hard?

This week had a big challenge when I went to play golf with my dad and he offered me the usual post round beer.  I used medication as an excuse because I honestly didn't feel like going into the details of how I was spiraling downward out of control.  
My wife was being supportive by giving it up for a time but she had some wine last night and that didn't really bother me.  I did notice that even after she brushed her teeth I could smell it on her which made me realize that no matter how clever I thought I was hiding it, it was probably very obvious.  

I've started journalling again and here are some observations from the past three weeks:

*Night sweats stopped around day 4.
*The first week I wanted to murder everyone, I got insanely mad at someone who got on the elliptical behind me at the gym, like irrationally mad.  I wanted to murder him and everyone who hadn't murdered him up to that point.
*Fog lifted after day 9.
*Sugar cravings started about one week in and subsided this weekend. (Drank more soda and ate more candy in that period than I did the last two years combined, cherry coke zero was an unbelievable crutch for cravings)
*Energy levels spiked around start of week 2
*I am sleeping like a log all night, the only downsides are I constantly dream about being embarrassed by drinking and getting up is harder because I am just that out of it.  But once I'm up, I'm up and after coffee I feel refreshed.
*My resting heart rate has dropped 25 bpm and my blood pressure is in a healthy range.
*The pain in my abdomen is gone

I have follow up blood work next week and I'm curious to see my results after a month.

I am a 28 y.o. family man with an addiction to alcohol. I've never wanted to admit it, though I've known it for some time now.

Casual drinkers don't feel a compulsion to go grab 3 tall boys from the gas station while going to grab takeout in hopes to just catch a little bit better of a buzz at home alone. Casual drinkers don't hope that they have cash at hand so their wife doesn't see a charge on the credit card for a 6 pack to go watch a game at a buddies when you already have a case in the fridge at home.. I am ashamed.

I kicked (am kicking) a chewing tobacco addiction I had for 10 years a few years back. Almost 1200 days. It seems like such a distant thing now. I still know that one dip would put me right back. I know that one beer, one glass of wine, one shot will put me back to 0. I'll do what I need to do and take it one day at a time. I **need** to be better for my family.

And promptly started smoking and drinking heavily, abandoning all desires to run.

This dog is well loved, well fed, and well cuddled.  But every time I look at him I feel the sting of failure and neglect.  He needs real exercise.  I started walking with him again and it's like we're back to square one with being on leash.  Well not square one, but he can get on a tear of pulling where I only get like two steps between stops.  More failure as a mom.

I started walking with him about a month ago after I got sober, but I think his allergies were really bad and he started chewing a hole in his tail fur.  So I stopped.  More failure.  Fuck.

It's gotten cold here in the last week with some overnight freezes.  We've been out for the last two days in a row, doing at least 1.5 miles.

I didn’t drink, I don’t want to drink. I didn’t reset my counter, and it isn’t dishonest for me not to, as far as I am concerned—as an old timer told me last night, “leave what doesn’t work, take the rest”. If it’s dishonest for you to not reset it you have a sip of whiskey, by god reset. You do you. And if in response to the question “are you going to hurt yourself?”, a person I love says “I don’t know”, I will follow them anywhere, including a bar. I’ll be more careful what I post here in the future, it’s always felt safe here but yesterday, less so. 

********

Today is day 300. I celebrated my birthday, Easter, my wedding anniversary, and my husband’s birthday sober. I have made it through two holiday weekends, a visit to my in laws, and very bad work news, all sober. 

My husband has been sober for three months. This has been a tremendous help to my sobriety, and for our marriage. 

He has been having an extremely difficult time at work. Last night, he sat at a bar and drank. I sat next to him and drank an NA beer. I did have a sip of his whiskey in a moment of “fuck it all, we are never going to escape this bullshit, may as well slide down the hill next to him.” With the holidays coming up, I’ve been thinking more about drinking and suddenly, abstinence seemed like punishment instead of reward. 

The whiskey tasted great. I don’t even drink whiskey. 

I didn’t have more, I didn’t order one for myself. I thought about how I’d never made it to day 300, not since I started drinking at 21, 23 years ago. I thought about how I could make it one more day to 300, and if I still wanted to drink, I could after that—safe in the knowledge I could make it to 300 days again. I thought about the morning, about the hangover I’d have. 

So I’m having an espresso and I’m about to get in the shower. No hangover. I don’t feel the need to reset my counter. I don’t know if I will make it through today or this week, but I made it through last night. I wish I were celebrating but I feel like I went through trauma last night. I’m upset and a little lost but I’m holding on to the light that is not drinking, I’m giving myself a little grace, and trying to reframe last night as a victory rather than a slip.

It wasn't an issue (yet).  Everything was fine.  No changes to work or family or sleep/gym etc etc.

Then on Friday my friend had the first party in a long time with all the local lockdowns etc.  I must admit it was fun (not sure if it was the drinks or just being able to socialize again). I had a lot.  Didn't do anything I regret  but it totally fucked my entire weekend.  And I was having more drinks Saturday and Sunday... not to enjoy them or to get drunk, just so I could function the rest of the weekend.  Tapered yesterday but had a brutal night with anxiety, heart racing, insomnia, sweats, etc.

And the craziest thing is this is not even close to the top 10 bad Mondays I can remember.  But why the hell would I want to even feel like this? 

I had the longest period of sobriety in my life.  I was at 8 or 9 months.  It was good.  I learned a lot and I can take some of those lessons as well as what happened this weekend to move forward.

So I am here again, checking in and making the pledge to make this thing permanent.  But saying that and as cliche as it sounds, I am only concerned about today.  I""ll worry about tomorrow tomorrow.  IWNDWYT.",118

Ended the daily half-bottle, three good weeks… then a relapse. Then two good weeks and the pattern repeats. 5 days since the last one.

The crux of my issue is that my partner, who has been through all of it with me, is done with the drinking and if I keep at it she’s justifiably done with me. Now this pattern is putting her through this terrible emotional rollercoaster of hope and fear.

Probably have one or two relapses left before she justifiably asks me to leave.

It’s been rough on my end too, naturally. I don’t get cravings as much as lose my damn mind briefly and stop into a bar for a drink. Sometimes it feels like there’s almost no in-between time to fight it—occasionally I can catch it.

Once I’m “home safe” at the end of the day (dinnertime) I’m fine. But I’m a handyman and fixer so I’m out and about all day. Currently, I’ve got alarms set throughout the day for HALT checks. I avoid the one block in my small town where I get my alcohol. I check in here often, and get a lot of exercise through my work. And recently (since the last relapse) I’ve started leaving my cash card at home and only bringing enough cash for lunch as I go about.

The last one felt different. I felt my partner’s pain like never before. No ultimatums made: she understands the struggle well and has been patient. I feel more resolved than ever—but I don’t trust myself. 

I know it’s different for everyone, but please, I need your strategies, perspectives, and, especially, if you’ve found yourself on this hamster wheel I’m on, your stories about breaking this pattern.",47

More creative.

Better skin and face is less puffy.

Enjoying watching movies again.

Terrible sleep and vivid dreams.

Exhaustion, tired all the time.

Sugar cravings and eating more.

No weight loss, probable weight gain.

Marginal, not magical, improvement in mental health.

Avoiding social occasions to avoid temptation.

Regular desire to feel that first drink feeling.

Just for today I am NOT drinking.","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Welcome to Monday SD! Whether you’re rested and ready to go, or blearily adjusting to the time change, I’m so glad you’re here. 

Yesterday I mentioned that I used to pretend and I thought it might be helpful to share some of what that looked like: “I’m not hungover, I have bad allergy or a sinus infection” — When my face was totally bloated like a melon; Not letting on that I’d had at minimum 2 glasses of wine before friends or family ever came over because what if they just have 2 drinks and that’s never enough; getting up early on trash day to sneak bottles out to the dumpster; replacing my husband’s honey bourbon that I sat up drinking for hours and thinking he never knew I was drinking it. Believe me he knew. Everyone always knows. And the old standby of telling the liquor store I’m having a party and that’s why I’m back so soon. 

Talk about a recipe for anxiety and depression! I would verbally beat myself up for choices like these every single day. 

These days my family and friends can call anytime and I’m always sober; my dog can count on me for great walks every day; I stop and consider my replies to family, friends and coworkers and work to stay rooted in honesty and integrity. It’s such a precious gift. And I’m learning to like and trust myself more with each day. Which is shocking in and of itself. 

So what made the difference:  the Daily Check In every day, all of the wisdom on this sub, great sober books and podcasts and a sober app on my phone. No one succeeds without effort and I truly believe this is the best thing I’ve done for myself in ages. IWNDWYT friends and I look forward to hearing from you on this gift of a day 💕🍁",392

I hate how fucking fat I am, I hate how fucking crazy and obnoxious my brain is without booze, I hate how incredibly frustrating and infuriating and AGGRAVATING it is to try and ride the ""crave wave"" especially when you just need to focus on something else and don't have the fucking energy to actively distract your brain from wanting the fucking booze. I'm sick of being fucking poor. I'm sick of spending so much energy trying to shut my stupid fucking brain off so I can study without utilizing booze to shut it off. 

I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF FUCKING ALL OF IT. I literally don't even know what to do at this point. Am heavily considering asking for the medications that doctors prescribe to stop people from drinking, because I cannot do it by sheer willpower alone. I have been trying for 3 years. I have been aggravated to tears by trying to just ride the stupid fucking ""crave wave"" SO many times. I have tried every fucking craft/hobby/distraction in the book to help ride out the ""crave wave"", but nothing stops my stupid fucking brain from thinking about it all the fucking time. I've read This Naked Mind, it unfortunately didn't do the good for me that it did for the rest of y'all. 

God I fucking hate this so fucking much. I just want to be thin, fit and fucking pretty again. I don't want to care about the stupid fucking booze anymore. I want to punch the shit out of my stupid fucking brain so it will just SHUT THE FUCK UP FOR FUCKING ONCE.

I've been losing my hair as a result of my drinking and I'm ashamed to say it but that's the thing that finally made me realise what I was doing to myself. Nevermind the damage to my teeth, or the broken metabolism, or the constant low-level depression, the loss of intelligence.

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

On a more positive note, I've started listening to Atomic Habits by James Clear and the advice that stuck with me from it is that habit feeds identity feeds habit. As in, if I identify as a person that doesn't drink I will work harder at it. There's a whole lot of other changes I'm going to be making in my life to build into the person I want to be, but starting today, I will no longer tell myself that I am a drinker. I no longer want that to be a part of my identity. 

I am rusted-nail. I am a writer, a reader, a musician, and as of today, I am not a drinker.

I'm so glad to be a part of this community.

When I don’t drink and am sober I wake up, I see clearly. I see some sort of purpose and future. But I don’t see exactly what that is. But I have some drive for it. 

Then I drink. Again. Maybe again and again. And I become dull. Listless. But that’s known. It’s safe. Cause and effect: drink a lot, be hungover, skate by in mediocrity. 

I’m not that person. I want to love big and bold. But here I am, acting the opposite. It’s a self of self sabotage. Self harm. Which turns into self hatred. Self denigration. Shame.

I haven’t been able to get past the drinking part much lately. I don’t even enjoy drinking anymore. I don’t want to be drinking. And yet I end up with a beer in my hand time and time again, with no one to blame but myself. It’s insane to me how my desires and actions can be so juxtaposed. It’s crazy making. Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. 

I feel like a horrible person today, a hungover piece of human trash. I wasn’t a good son today. I didn’t wake up early. I barely did anything. I didn’t exercise. I can do so much better.

Hadn't skipped a night in months.  My problem is mostly with the anxiety of not sleeping.  The booze itself is secondary (or so I tell myself).

I'm drinking all the calmative herbal teas (chamomile, valerian root, passion flower, lavendar, lemon balm, etc.). I've had good luck with them in the past.  It's getting close to bedtime and I do feel a bit tired.  Fingers crossed.

I feel fine.  No cravings...no withdrawal...just worried about sleep. My experience in the past is that if I get through a night or two, I'm golden.  Cold turkey doesn't bother me.

But then a few days or a couple weeks later I'll decide to cook something special, and I think ""oh it would be nice to have some wine while I'm cooking.  I'll be all fancy.""  LOL  Then three months later I'll be kicking myself for it because I'll have drank every night since.

Gotta remember not to do that.  SOCIAL drinks only (if I find I can handle that.)  No drinking alone, ever.

Passionflower and chamomile are actually pretty tasty.  They aren't very ""floral"".  Tastier than wine or beer for sure - I'm tired of sour rotten fruit taste and I'm tired of yeasty wet wheat taste.

Powerless and feeling terrified.,"Friends, I've lurked around this sub for a long time. I think I have periodically exposed myself to your community in attempts to convince myself that the way I drink falls below the standard of what ""real"" alcoholism looks like and that I can just sort of absorb a few helpful platitudes, a little secondhand empathy, and be on my way. I often found myself reading stories of lost jobs, troubled relationships, legal problems, terrible health episodes etc and thinking ""wow, I like to drink and all but I'm way smarter and more in control than these poor drunks."" Certainly this felt and feels cowardly and I'm no longer able to look at your community from a distance; there's so much sameness between my story and those who have had the courage to post here.   


I have a good friend who's a bartender and a hell of a drinker. He and I went to a show on Friday despite the fact that it was seriously unsettling to my partner, who has SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE. I promised my partner that I would hold it together,  drink in moderation, and would be back promptly following the concert, would be careful and take care of myself. I'm finishing up a graduate degree and I needed the weekend to get a bunch of work done. I had a hellish week of work and needed sleep, exercise, and focus.   


What happened, of course, was very far from that. We of course went out after the show. After the WHO KNOWS what shot of whiskey, I got on my bicycle, fell off it, lacerated my head, rode 12 miles in the wrong direction away from home. Three hours after I texted my partner '20 minutes' I showed up bleeding badly, perhaps concussed, drenched in pee, and ranting like a maniac. The fact that all I lost was some blood, shit ton of money for drinks, lots of dignity, and a piece of bicycle equipment defies me because I spent a certain amount of time weaving and falling off the bike in the median of a busy ass road. Spent some time lying in a bush too. That's where I pissed in my pants, I think.   


I have been messing up my life with booze for more than half the damn thing. Started young. I have hurt myself and people I love for a long time and I don't want to die either soon, or with the regret of having so repeatedly abused the trust of my beautiful partner that she had to leave me to protect her well-being. I don't know what I'd do in her shoes– I'd probably leave me. It's sufficient to say that the fate of our relationship is not a foregone conclusion, nor is it the sole reason for my quitting alcohol; not dying or living a degraded humiliating life is that reason.   


I surrender. White flag, friends. I'm putting this thing down and I'm going to need a lot of help to do it. It's been 2 days and the thought of total sobriety scares the shit out of me, but I couldn't be clearer that now is the time to get serious about doing all the things I thought I was too smart to have to do to get and stay sober. Here I am, lurking no more, wanting to fix myself and do the work.",13

Why can I have so much love and support in my life and still feel empty? It makes me feel selfish and sick.

After years of heavy drinking it all came to a head Halloween night.
I had been playing cards with some friends (drinking a few “warm-up beers”) my wife called and asked to meet her at a friend’s Halloween party. Stopped by our house real quick to get the dog and drove to our friends place. Had a large quantity of cocktails over the course of an hour.

Wife wasn’t keeping track of me (not her job) and I forget everything after this. Apparently I got in the car, started it, and we drove about 2 feet down the driveway. She immediately stopped me and took over driving. 

I woke up at 3:30 in the morning to an empty bed and no clue how I got there. I have never driven in that condition and was incredibly relieved my wife(not a drinker) had stopped me. So many terrible things could have happened.

I am facing my alcoholism for the first time in my life (39y Male) 

I am scared, jubilant and everything in between. I had significant withdrawals (shaking hands, bad anxiety, etc) for about 4 days. Now I’m just tired and feel out of it (like my brain isn’t working very well)

I can't believe she's gone.

I'm still really raw, but it's Sunday night and I'm still sober. This has been the biggest test of my sobriety in the last year, I think. Thankfully I've had the company of very good people and I've eaten more than is strictly healthy.

 Not even sure why I'm writing this. Just wanted to tell people but I'm trying to keep away from regular social media for a few days until everyone has got some of the public grief fest out of their system.

Lost weight 

Mental clarity

With that, better memory

More productive overall

With that, more money

Also more money bc I’m not blowing it at bars

A healthy, loving relationship

Confidence that my emotions are genuine

Normal sleep 

I actually like mornings, who knew

I have hobbies. Real hobbies. Crazy. 

I like myself. Genuinely. That’s easily the best part



Cons:

Boredom

Having to deal with the reality that even though sobriety is MORE appealing, a drink always seems appealing. 




Stopping drinking was really exciting at first. Almost like it’s own high. Now it’s just a part of me. I’m just a person who doesn’t drink. There’s nothing flashy or liberating about it these days. It just is. Which is cool, but it definitely makes me  need to just step back for a second and remind myself why, what I gain from this, and why I maintain.

May be underlying stuff but overall I'm pretty happy and never really feel this way until I get drunk and pass out. The best way I can describe the feeling is shame. I feel down all day and like I should've never drink. Like instant regret when I wake up. Don't want to get out of bed. Bummed out all day. It's weird. Drinking used to be fun and I looked forward to doing it as often as possible. Now I wait 1-4 weeks between drinking sessions and always regret it. Maybe I should quit. I quit smoking about 4 months ago and that's been off and on pure hell. Sometimes I wish I could go back to those carefree days when I was 21 or 22, beer in one hand, cigarette in the other. I'll be 30 pretty soon. I've never really made a serious effort, like made my mind up to quit drinking. It's like I know I don't need to. And I'll lie to myself after a week or two and say well I'll drink less, so I won't feel bad when I wake up. Last night I drank an 18 pack of bud light and 2 Sam Adams Octoberfests I had left over from last drinking session. I just feel icky and sad. I think I could quit if I made my mind up to. How do I let it go? I let smoking go because I seriously wanted to quit. I started to associate smoking as being something for poor dumb people. And I grew up poor, parents poor and smoked. I got where even though I smoked seeing other people smoke irritated me. So I quit. I need to get that way with alcohol I guess.",11

Since I committed to stopping, I’ve thrown myself into and replaced alcohol with daily exercise, while simultaneously maintaining a healthy diet, with a strict routine and sticking with weekly counselling to treat issues of depression, anxiety and PTSD.

I’m getting to be in the best shape of my life. It’s become easier to fall asleep in the evening and in general feel well rested after waking up in the morning. I have more energy throughout the day with little caffeine intake and feel less zapped from completing tasks. I’m more clear-headed and stress free. Without escaping with alcohol I’ve found it a lot easier to confront and deal with problems and issues. Social situations have surprisingly become better; I’m more engaged and contribute more to the conversation with lower levels of social anxiety (this just blows my mind) compared to drinking. I feel more in the moment as apposed to being stuck in my head. My skin is clearer and more radiant. A week ago I caught myself in the mirror and smiled because I saw a different person to the one I was used to seeing. I’m starting to get excited about things and life again. It feels great. 

I still have work to do and aways to go but just thought I’d check in and share my progress so far and some of the positive changes I’ve been seeing 🙂.

I quit drinking for now back in July after having a panic attack that I mistook for a heart attack after a day of heavy drinking. Went to the doctor ASAP and they found abnormalities in my EKG; haven't touched liquor since. Was 300 pounds then, weight is now down to 280 or so. Was going through a case of beer and a bottle of whiskey weekly at the time I quit.

Both my parents became disabled in their 40s; the health scare encouraged me to start running and lifting weights once I got the green light from my doctor... used to be really active in my 20s up until my mid 30s but have had a pretty sedentary lifestyle for last few years.. after my kid was born I barely had time to exercise at all.

Saw my cardiologist this week to go over results from heart tests and all that fun stuff. Apart from the good news (abnormalities were pretty much due to obesity and 100% reversible with weight loss, and that I just have weird baselines rather than anything that's a health concern), my doctor told me that at the amount I was drinking, deciding to stop drinking was the most important health choice I've ever made for myself. And that with my physical fitness pre-quitting drinking and the volume/frequency of alcohol I was drinking, I was at extremely high risk of having a heart attack in my fifties... and that the combination of quitting drinking and exercising again was improving my outcomes exponentially.

It meant a lot to me - especially because a lot of my friends are giving me a hard time about quitting drinking right now and honestly it's a fucking struggle every day not to have a whiskey when I come home from work. But having my doctor say I'm doing something right for once meant a lot to me.",309

It’s been an issue for years, but only heightened from my boyfriend passing away unexpectedly a couple of months ago. His family just got the toxicology report back and it was most likely a mixture of gabapentin and alcohol.
I don’t drink most nights, but it is the one night a week that I end up doing it that ends up being catastrophic. Thankfully nothing really bad has happened, but I end up at strangers houses sometimes, blacking out most of the time, not sleeping when I have work the next day. The one night of drinking takes a huge toll on my mental health and well-being. I’ve felt this way for a long, long time and have made many promises to myself to stop, but end up making rash decisions and land myself in the same spot over and over again. 
I’m living with my mom at 27 for the first time in almost a decade. It’s hard feeling like my whole life has been uprooted and that the person I was closest to in the world is no longer here. I’m trying to work through the trauma in therapy but I feel like I erase any progress through drinking.
I really want so badly to show up for myself and be comfortable in solitude, I just don’t even know where to begin or how to make it stick. I’ve read some books (quit like a woman, this naked mind) and used to go to Buddhist recovery meetings which was nice but didn’t seem to do the trick. And I just can’t understand why I keep holding myself back from being healthy and doing better. I feel so ashamed of myself.
So, to everyone here, what works in early sobriety? How do you fill your time? What do you say to the voice that tells you you can handle only having one drink then going home?
Friday night I ended up out drinking and then while drunk did cocaine and wound up at a strangers house then called out of work both yesterday and today because I still haven’t recovered. I just want so badly to feel that my actions align with my values.

I've had several decent stints of sobriety, both inside of AA and outside of AA using harm reduction. However, starting during the pandemic in 2020, I started to drink again. It started slow, but there have been several ""binge events"" in the last \~2 years, one of which happened this past Friday. Got invited over for some beers with some professional friends, one of which is proposing a business venture with me. I, of course, drank before going over, and then drank to much and ended up making a fool of myself. Not only that, but I drove home afterwards, which I promised myself I would never do again.

Saturday I woke up with a shame so deep, I thought I wouldn't be able to make it through the day without drinking. My mind, attacking me with the stupidity of my actions, feeling about as tall as a piece of dog shit. I knew then that I have to do something different. I have to change. I have to be better. I have two young children, and a beautiful and hardworking wife. I have my own company, and we just got investment and will be able to really grow into our vision. I have a good life. I don't want to lose all of this because of my drinking. And I will, if I don't stop.

I have to admit there were moments… these specific types of work holidays used to be booze infused. Pretty much the whole purpose while away would be to drink. And I was the only one not imbibing this time.
It ended up being the best holiday I’ve ever been on, and that’s because instead of alcohol being my hobby/activity while there, I did writing, hiking, tours, running, meditating, swimming, reading etc etc. And all with a crisp mind and clear memory! 
I used to come home from these holidays and need a week to feel normal again. Despite arriving home at 3am after travel, I feel fantastic and ready to take on the day! 
All thanks to not drinking. I am so grateful I was able to make it though and therefore able to see how much better every aspect of life can be once alcohol is removed.

I have been drinking, a lot, for about 10 years. It cost me a number of close friends, a lot of time, a ridiculous amount of money, hindered me in my professional life and has gained me absolutely nothing.

A few months ago I got into a relationship who is just a incredible fit. Yesterday we got into a, completely pointless, argument but I was too drunk to realize that it was about nothing. Had I been sober we would have talked it out in a minute.

What timeline to expect?,"History:  I was a daily drinker from 2004 to about 2017.  Had my, ""What am I doing with my life?"", moment and quit for a few months.  I slowly started drinking again but only weekends like I did in college.  Thought that would be ok.  ""I work hard, I deserve it, blah blah"".

So since 2018 or so I've been a binge drinker most weekends unless I'm travelling or something.  Even when travelling I'd have, ""maintenance doses"", in restaurants etc.  I can easily put back 1-1.5 handles of vodka between Friday and Saturday.  I'll stay up playing video games or watching old movies until 8-9am then go fall in bed til 4pm.

Last weekend was turning point number 2.  I got so drunk, both nights, I blacked out and fell.  I fell a lot.  I fell trying to get back up.  I fell in the bathroom.  I fell in the cat litter box...  (its ok, you can laugh).  I slept in the floor of my home office.  I terrified my wife, who was already worried.  But finding me sleeping all day on the couch or bed was very different than this.  So I decided to give it up again, but completely.

So the week began with the typical binge drinker recovery arc.  Monday - Tuesday felt shitty.  Wednesday started to feel better.  Thursday felt normal.  Friday I was feeling great again.  Then last night I started feeling shitty, like delayed reaction withdrawals.  Today I feel ok but foggy and tired despite sleeping like 12 hours.

Is this what its like to withdraw as a weekend binge drinker?  My body recovered normally until I missed ""weekly feeding time"", and then withdrawals start up all over again?

2021-11-07 12:24:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qot7kp/its_time_to_stop/,It’s time to stop.,"There’s so many things running through my head that it’s hard to know where to start. This might be a bit disorganized…

I’m 37, single with no kids, male living in America, and I’ve finally recognized that I need to stop drinking. I was always the guy who liked beer, the craft beer geek, etc. but never had any problems with it, despite most of my father’s side of the family having issues with alcohol. That all changed in early 2020. It was before the pandemic had truly hit, and I had been with the most amazing woman I have ever known for about a year at the time. I won’t go into detail, but something happened outside of our control that forced us to go our separate ways. It had nothing to do with alcohol. It can be incredibly painful to be in love with someone who doesn’t love you back. Knowing that someone loves you back that you cannot live your life with is absolutely excruciating. It devastated me.

Then the pandemic hit. I had always traveled for work, and suddenly life being shut down hit me like a freight train. I’ve read that depression and anxiety have been a major issue during the pandemic, and I was no exception. I found myself just laying in bed all day. And that’s when the drinking started. The company I was with at the time went to work from home extremely early on. I was able to keep everything hidden because I was always able to get my work done.

I actually even started a new job that was a big step up, even though I was already pretty successful. I’ve been traveling again since April, and haven’t had any issues with work. What I do have issues with is my personal life. Every week I think to myself that this will be the weekend where things change, where I’m going to stop drinking, fix my life, and catch up on everything I’ve been neglecting. I always get some beer on the way home from the airport “just to unwind”, and then I always find myself hungover on a Sunday wondering where the weekend went. 

I was very fortunate a few years ago and bought a luxury loft condo in a beautiful part of the country for roughly $400k when the building was nearly empty. The building has since filled up, and one of my neighbors just sold his unit for $750k despite it being smaller than mine. Why do I bring this up? Because it embarrasses me so badly. Nearly every table, countertop, desk, and dresser is littered with empty bottles. I don’t remember the last time I actually cleaned something. My bathrooms are downright disgusting. If someone walked through my front door right now and saw it all, I would probably break down into tears. 

The problem is that since I’ve never had real repercussions from drinking, never gotten a DUI, never lost a job, it’s all something that’s a secret. No one knows how bad it’s become, and I want to keep it that way. I can’t fathom the embarrassment of admitting all of this to my friends and family. I’m just hoping I can find support in this community. 

Just typing this all out has been incredibly therapeutic. I know I have a lot of work ahead of me. I just need some positivity and encouragement.",23

I have been project managing a commercial remodel for the past couple months, something that I am capable of, but otherwise not something I have practice doing, so it has been uniquely challenging. 


My partner and I have been working 6 days a week for the past couple months, averaging 65 hours a week. Most nights there’s just enough gas left in the tank to walk the dog, throw a load of laundry in, feed ourselves, and crash.


Yesterday I had to burn half the day (literally 5 hours) running ALL over town to try and find a couple supplies/pieces of equipment that the trade scheduled for yesterday came up short on. Getting these items was time-sensitive and critical for the project moving forward. When I returned to the site I was shaking I was so unglued. Five. Fucking. Hours.


At the end of the day I had to speak with the two main guys who have been doing the day-to-day fixes and install (they are like rockstar handymen), who have been bringing their personal bullshit to the job site. So on top of being in a heightened table-flipping mode for 5 hours, I had to talk to a couple of guys old enough to be be my father about playing nice in the sandbox. 


So I said that’s it, I’m stopping at the liquor store on the way home, that was enough for me for one day; I needed to disassociate, quickly and grandly. 


But I didn’t. I got home, I walked the dog, I threw a load of laundry in, I fed myself, and I went to bed early. 


And even though it was really hard, I woke up today not having to apologize to my partner for picking a fight, I don’t feel like shit, and I get to enjoy my one day off without a ton of guilt or anxiety. 


So if I can deal with a day like yesterday without drinking, I can deal with a lot more than I thought.

It allows you to enjoy and thrive of the The quitting process instead of fighting through hard days.

Never. (Social anxiety to the max). But I went to a friend’s 30th birthday party last night— it was a good, old fashioned house party: Beer pong, weed, and pizza. Just plain FUN. She and her husband are not the house party type, per say, so there were also cocktails and snacks and beautiful decor. It was great. And I… didn’t drink alcohol. I’m still stunned. I was a little bummed to miss out on the group shots and true beer pong, but I still raised my mocktail and played beer pong with water— and I had a great time! I offered to be DD so I had to follow through. The friends I drove ended up staying longer and taking an Uber home, so I drove home around 9:30 (love it). What I noticed: you can be THE most awkward person in the world- and NO ONE will notice bc they’re all drunk. Literally no one cared what I was doing (or not doing). It was pretty cool and freeing. Kinda weird being sober- surreal, really. But I enjoyed watching everyone else get progressively more drunk and I drove home knowing I’d feel perfectly fine in the morning. It’s 7:30am now, I’m making coffee and about to take my dog for a walk. :) IWNDWYT.",13

Just want to say I’ve been sober for three days now and counting, and also that last night I went to a small music festival about an hour and a half from where I’m staying right now.

I got pulled over on my way home! I have made that exact drive while drunk multiple times. Somehow made it through years of alcoholism without getting a DUI or worse. Anyway, it was so nice knowing that the worst that could happen was a speeding ticket (I was doing about 17 over) but they were probably trying to catch drunk people leaving the festival as there was a speed trap. Anyway, the cop let me off with a warning. It was like a little sign from the universe saying “you made the right choice. See how much worse this could’ve been?”

Also there was free booze just sitting out at this festival that took place downtown in multiple bars and breweries and I was not once tempted to drink.

I think I got this.

Some notes if you are trying to quit.,"Have been a fairly heavy drinker and regular binger. 31 days ago, had 13 whiskey sours and blacked out. Woke up next day, hungover and ashamed, to embark on a month long sober challenge. Happy to announce I’ve made it work, not a drop of Alcohol in one fucking month. 

Few changes I’ve noticed in these 31 days. 

1. Sleep - My schedule finally improved. A week into my sobriety I started sleeping on time and waking up early morning. I was always a night time drinker. Picking the bottle at 11pm and drinking till 4am so I could finally sleep. Now I sleep like a baby. My eyes shut by the time it’s 1am. Waking up at 9am as oppose to 3pm when on alcohol. 

2. Energy - one of the biggest change I notice once my sleep schedule improved. I am now waking up happy, no hangover and overall energy levels has improved substantially. 

3. Weight Loss - I’m what you call skinny fat. Guess the 600-800 alcohol calories everyday weren’t helping. I’ve lost almost 10pounds in 31 days. Double chin and tummy are on their way out. No bloating of the face either. 

4. Socialising - this is the bit that sucked. Had to go out for social dos twice in the last month where essentially everyone was high except me. You eventually get bored and small talk is no fun. On the brighter side you can focus on food ( I don’t remember the last time I actually enjoyed food at a party) and entertain yourself seeing your friends say/do stupid shit. You also want to leave early because nothing good ever happens at an after party. You also get to remember everything that happened the previous night and your friends call you to ask if they embarrassed themselves last night. As an alcoholic and someone who’s been at the other end of the call, the right thing to do is to tell them they were fine and well behaved 🤣

5. Don’t keep alcohol at home - probably the most important reason that I could stay sober for 31 days. If you are having friends over, buy booze for that day and give away the left over. Keeping booze at home is the easiest way to fuck things up. 

I don’t know what my relationship with alcohol will be going forward but tonight I’m going to enjoy my Ginger Ale and give myself a pat on the back. May be somewhere between my 6th and the 7th sip it’ll be day 32 of my 60 day challenge.",46

But even after 450 days of sobriety. For whatever reason, I decided that buying a case of beer was a good idea.

And then after another 150 days sober; I decided that buying ANOTHER case of beer was a good idea.

At no point in time was it a good idea. Because a case of beer is never just a case of beer. Once or twice it didn't lead to more beer. But usually, it would lead to another one, the next day. And another one, the next day.

And this last time. I bought a case of beer. Cause, dumb. And woke up, the next day, downing the bottom of one of the three beers that I brought to bed with me.

And then, all bets were off. So she asked me ""why did you buy beer?"" And I basically had no answer. Because there really wasn't one. I honestly have no idea.

I know that it's never a wise decision for me to have alcohol. I'm just one of those people. But, I wish that I had something that I could say to her, that could accurately describe what it's like. Being clean and sober for so many days. Only to wake up one day, knowing that it's a bad idea, knowing that I'm not the type of person who can drink one day, and then just go back to business as usual. And just throw it all away.

I know that she's running out of forgiveness. I know that I need to be better for her. Because she has been the one constant good thing in my life, probably ever. And I certainly don't want to lose my family. Or have my daughter grow up knowing that I am a wild alcoholic. I'd much rather have her grow up knowing me as a fun, funny dad.

This has turned very ranty. I am usually pretty good with words. But when it comes to trying to explain this to her, I always fall flat.",4

First post on to this forum. Last October I decided to quit drinking, which is something that I had always wanted to do. Due to the Lockdowns in the UK from November to April and paired with my new love for running, it was actually quite easy. I managed 4 months of complete sobriety and was feeling like I had very much turned a corner in my attitude towards alcohol, and with the country coming out of lockdown in April, I felt prepared that I would be able to moderate my drinking when the inevitable social drinking events resumed. This has unfortunately not proven to be the case, and I have repeatedly humiliated myself in front of others in most social drinking occasions ( work parties etc). I just don't know what's wrong with me. I have no desire to drink at home but for some reason I am unable to turn down a drink if I am in any social situation and end up getting completely hammered. I very much feel like my lack of social skills contributes to my need to drink in front of others. At work parties for example, I never really feel like I fit in, and that I am being ignored, so I just end up drinking more than anyone else and blacking out. I feel very depressed at the moment. I was just wondering if anyone else had any similar struggles to re adapt to drinking in the post lockdown world? I almost crave for the days when going to pubs and meeting up with people wasn't a possibility, as I would have less opportunity to drink.",4

I’m someone who never sits still and constantly going so that first beer or drink was my way of finally making myself sit down and relax. And then it was never just one. And those relax drinks quickly turn into a regularly scheduled thing. 


I quit drinking for almost 6 months this year after dry January. Had covid end of last year and got another nasty cold and it was the perfect time to just feel better. Then I had one drink with old friends and it just gave me the excuse to drink whenever again. 

So I don’t have a problem just quitting. I do it fairly easily. But it’s so easy to slip back into the routine when I give in. 

Long story short, I’m making this post for accountability. I’m a super fit person. Work out a ton. And I’m not doing myself any favors by adding alcohol and calories into the equation for no reason. And I’m just a better person all around when I’m not tied down to that night time “relaxing” routine.

I won’t go into details but I didn’t hurt anyone including myself. Since then I’ve been shipped to my dads to get clean, yesterday I went to my first AA meeting and it was a revelation. Being a non-believer I found it rather odd with the god references, but each to their own is fine. Listening to everyone’s stories was heart-breaking and warming at the same time. It’s really hard to bottle these emotions into a few sentences as it’s not something I’m very articulate at, but being there made me feel less confused and alone as I have been in my adult life (I’m 33, have been an alcoholic since 18). Going through various talk therapies, exercises and general attempts at getting sober not working out - I really have hope with this. I got so overwhelmed towards the end of our 1.5hr meeting when I plucked up the courage to talk, trying to relate to other people’s stories and to tell mine I started to cry. Real ugly crying. The bloke next to me passed me a handkerchief and I sat with my head down on the table in my crossed arms. They all consoled me in the friendliest way and another bloke promptly told a funny story about his friend replacing gin with water. I soon cheered up, dried my eyes and felt the courage to sit up and look people in the eye. Afterwards I spoke to a few people and they were so supportive and encouraging.

Today is day 47 for me and it has been one heck of a tough week for me, but I made it through without drinking!

First, I work for a foreign-owned company and a few weeks ago, execs from our parent company came into our US company and my life has been turned upside down. I had been up for promotion to CFO for the past 2.5 years (as promised by our CEO), as well as my counterpart in operations to COO. They decided to ax our CEO (who is from our foreign parent company), gave everyone a promotion (counterpart to CEO, all other levels promoted, except for me....they are all male). I know that they have an aversion to women in executive positions and all that were promoted were men. I asked my current CEO if it was because I am a woman and he said nothing, but then said he was sorry. I have worked my behind off (nights, weekends, holidays) and they decided that I will stay where I am and there will not be a CFO. In the meantime, I had a recruiter contact me regarding a Controller position within a publicly-traded company and figured it was a REALLY great time to try to make a move. All went well....I was invited to dinner first, then had a 4.5 hour interview the next day. It was between me and another candidate. It took them 1.5 weeks to decide, but decided to go with the other candidate due to them spending their entire career within the industry. I just found this out on Friday evening. I wanted to drink, but I did not. 

Many things went wrong this week, but will not go into the others. Then yesterday was my birthday. Instead of drinking (I REALLY wanted to), I spent time with my daughter shopping and getting her set up in her new place. It was more memorable than any Bday in a very long time!! So glad I spent it with her rather than deciding to drink myself into oblivion. The urge to drink was extremely strong as I just wanted to forget the events of this week. 

Instead of dwelling on the negatives, I am going to celebrate my sobriety through all of this with a great cup of coffee this morning!! I know that something else, perhaps better, will come along and this too shall pass. 

I am going to continue to stay positive and focus on the good things in life, which are truly the things that matter. Being sober is my freedom from negative thinking and the only life I want for myself. I hope everyone is plowing ahead in their sobriety or attempts at becoming sober!

I had a job till June and finished my degree in September. I've been partying pretty hard since then, so a few friends and I decided not to drink in November.

When I was texting them this weekend asking what we were gonna do as a non-drinking activity, I realized that all of them are in a relationship and would be doing things with their partners. The thought of spending a night alone at home really depressed me. So, I met up with some single friends and I went out. I didn't get really wasted and I'm not hungover now, but my sober November only lasted 5 days. 

My friends who are not drinking are all really looking forward to having more time on the weekends to go for walks, exercise, read, whatever. But the thing is, being unemployed, I can do all those things during the week, and I do: I eat well, exercise daily, read, don't drink. But I feel I need the weekend to let loose, and that includes alcohol. And, because I have enough time during the week to do those nice things, I don't really feel like I have an incentive not to be hungover on the weekends, because there is not that much new to do, especially with the weather being so bad. 

I was really taken aback by how miserable the thought of not drinking for a month made me feel. I'm guessing the feeling is exacerbated by the horrible weather and early nights where I'm living, but it really felt like I had a vast void in front of me and alcohol helps me bridge that void. 


Does this sound familiar to anyone and how do you cope with that? Because, even though I might not be up to quit drinking permanently, I really don't want it to turn into a coping mechanism.",2

It was great practice and I feel like it will get easier with each time i socialize without alcohol.

Weirdly i feel a little tired and headachy and almost hungover but i think it's just because I find being ""on"" and hosting draining. The bottle of wine is still in the fridge and i've been thinking about it a lot. I hate to waste food etc but think i'm going to have to pour it out.

I am 33 now and I am sober since March 21st of 2021. That counts 231days(I googled 🙃) I stopped smoking as well because it’s a trigger. 
After I was sure that I won’t be back to drinking I felt so sorry that I’ve wasted 20 years of my life. I was always a hardworking person and I would say successful.Now I am realizing how I never let my brain get sober even though I was drinking 3 4 days a week, you think you are okay on the days you are not drinking but nah. You are always drunk.couple drinks was never enough for me NEVER. So for the last 10 years i had started drinking alone because I guess I didn’t want people to see how much I drink, I didn’t wanna be around them or maybe they didn’t wanna be around me too. For the last 5 years I was so tired and I didn’t wanna drink at all, everytime I drink after the first sip I would get mad at myself and most of the time I would put myself down. 

Regrets? Yes so many but not so deep because I kinda feel like I had to go thru this so now I know I won’t be back to that lifestyle again. Thankfully I dodged getting dui many times and didn’t kill anyone driving drunk. Thank God!

We were trying for a baby so that was the main part of me quitting alcohol. I didn’t want a child to have a drunk father. And for my beautiful wife of course. Thanks to her she was so patient and she is well educated. 

Believe me or not when you quit something really helps you out. Now we are expecting a baby, we bought our first home. My job is going great and the best thing is I didn’t die or killed someone. I am more patient on everything, I feel more mature than ever. I am better at stress and anger management. 

All my wife , all because she loved me and believed in me. I call her my Angel , she thinks it’s too much but no it’s not.

And remember whoever reading this if i did so you can! It’s not hard, trust me it makes you so happy when you gather your fiends at a bar they are drinking and you are not, that accomplishment feel is priceless. And seeing how they act and change every sip they take is so much fun!

What started off as fun college and party activities slowly and surely served as a crutch for dealing with my problems and now it feels like my life is in pieces. 

Even as someone in mid twenties, I slowly went from straight sober, to a few drinks, very quickly to the drunkest person at an event, to drinking every single day. 

To the point right now, I’m probably going through around a fifth of hard liquor a day or more, barely eating anything, and then the sweats, rapid heart rate, and not really sleeping at all. Somewhere along the mix I developed a vape habit as well with a similar progression to using a disposable each day. 

There are sober pockets during the week but mainly half the day or a day at most per few weeks. 

I’m not even sure what to do anymore, substance abuse issues have become my copings for a couple years at this point, for school, work, family/relationship issues- and essential become the entirety of my outlook for the day just being numb to it all. To the point where I’ve damaged so many of my friendships/relationships, on track to probably lose/quit my job, and just overall become a shell of myself that I want to be in my twenties. 

In the end yeah, not sure where to start since I feel like I’m at the point of super high risk of either health problems, losing my job, damaging more relationships, and the only glue holding everything together is by numbing all the pain away. Ugh. 😭",8

I never realized the truth of the expression that alcohol is a crutch. It's a crutch and when you're terribly addicted to alcohol, you're disabled and can't walk, let alone fly.

I stopped drinking when I was 58 years old, so I spent a whole lifetime on that crutch. Those wasted years do make me sad, but they're gone. If I could tell younger people one thing it would be to throw down that crutch!

Just for today I am NOT drinking!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello to one and all. It’s my first time hosting so here we go. 

Earlier this year I joined Reddit just so I could join this sub. Peacefultoday was a wish and a hope as I was a mess plagued by anxiety and depression and I had no idea how to quit drinking. Other than one Whole 30, I hadn’t made it more than a week sober in well over 10 years. Heartfelt thanks to each of you. You and SD help. 

It’s about midnight in the southeastern US and I’m just home from a huge, fun, beautiful wedding. I drank Diet Coke all night and had a blast. Most fun I’ve had at a wedding in ages and I’m really, really grateful. 

A phrase I keep coming back to is “The only way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be”. I used to pretend all the time. You know what I mean. But tonight was new. Tonight t I was clear as a bell. I connected with friends in a great time, danced my tail off and there was no need to pretend about anything. I could just be. What an awesome gift. 

If you’re struggling tonight, Im sending peace and strength your way. I can say without a doubt that it’s worth it. I’m so grateful to wake up sober each morning. Happy Sunday SD. Whether lurking or posting, long time sober or seeking, I’m glad you’re here and IWNDWYT",369

It all started with a bad breakup. Then, the sleep problems started. I work third shift and I could just not sleep. They were doing construction on the building next to mine, construction on the road outside, and when the asshole kid downstairs wasn't beating on or cussing out his dad and grandma he was trying to learn guitar. 

I tried everything. I moved my bed into my living room. I put on fans. I played podcasts over my phone. I didn't sleep for like a week straight. And I couldn't stop thinking about my lost love. I went so long without sleep I was hearing voices. 

So I turned to the bottle just to pass out. 

It ramped up pretty quick. A half pint of whiskey turned to a pint pretty quick. I was drinking half drank tall boys from the day before with fruit flies in them. I was driving drunk to the liquor store to continue the drunk. For about two years straight I've been having at least 10 and sometimes more than 20 drinks a morning (again, I work nights). Every. Single. Morning.

I texted exes and other people embarrassing shit. Got in stupid arguments with my friends. Yelled at my mom on the phone until I made her cry. The other day, I woke up with a black eye, badly bruised knee, and a horrible shiner. I think I tripped on the way to the bathroom. I have plenty more stories of dumb shit I did. 

It's been about 4-5 days sober now. I haven't missed a single day in 3 years before that. The night before last was pretty rough. Some bad anxiety and shakiness, bad insomnia. But today I got THE MOST energizing, rejuvenating sleep I've had in years. I dreamt me and some cool, good looking people I don't recognize were at a restaurant. In the dream we were friends. We'd finished our dinner and I decided to order a drink at the bar. When it finally came it was clear, and I was arguing with the bartender that I wanted whiskey. When I went out to see my new friends they were looking at me with anger, disappointment, and disgust (I'm used to that). When I asked how long they'd been waiting, they said, very annoyed, twenty minutes. 

Seems like my subconscious is trying to tell me something. 

I gotta say, a few days sober feels great! Like I said, I feel like I finally slept, not just passed out but rested. Usually an energy drink would just help me limp through my hangover, but now I feel like I just ripped a few fat lines of coke or sucked the glass dick, haha. Almost feel like the cops are gonna bust in and arrest me for possession of an energy drink haha.

I'm eating healthy now, too. I was 190 lbs of muscle and turning heads before drinking. Now, I'm 350 lbs and turning stomachs, lol. But these last few days I've been pounding water, vegetables, and healthy foods. Watching my sugar and sodium (liver and kidneys are probably thankful). I feel like....high. I feel good. I feel healthy. I've turned my life around before (weight, drugs, etc.) and I know this feeling well. This is my comeback montage.",51

I have lived through an abusive relationship that ended six years ago but still haunts me (literally) because we have a kid together. For inquiring minds, the abuse was severely psychological but no hard proof of anything illegal so we share custody.

These past few weeks our kid has had an activity and my ex has taken every opportunity to harass me, loudly and in public, in front of other children and their parents. Each time I am stalwart and do my best to not show emotion. It’s been highly triggering lately, and I am in tears in the car on the way home. At least once I cried in front of my kid.

This used to be why I drank. And now it’s why I don’t. Trauma is a bitch but I raise my bottle of sparkling mineral water to us all tonight.",27

I am working on figuring out if I have some type of mood/personality disorder. But as it states right now I am still working on my mental health. Anyways I would say I was almost 2 years sober, I had drank a drink here and there but nothing that really get me more than a little tipsy. I also had really good self-control to not drink more than one drink. That is until last night. Last night sadly I was in the depths of it, feeling like garbage and decided ""fuck it, I want to drink and just relax"". Ended up drinking liquor beer and some wine. Now I'm finally out of my raging hangover from this morning. Looking back, it was another good lesson but still feeling super guilty. Luckily I didn't really feel super good while I was drunk. Just a little giggly for about half an hour and then straight depression after that. It reminded why I don't like this shit and how poisonous it is to me. I know it makes me feel horrible and will make me fill anxious the next couple of weeks yet my brain thinks I need to help cope with my issues. 

  
Anyways, restarting my sobriety again. hope the best to everyone else on this journey.",8

This is a place to talk about your successes and frustrations with your wellness goals.  It's a good place to set your intentions for the coming week.

If I had known I was going to host this week, I would have maybe exercised even a bit in preparation.  That's a lie.  There's _nothing_ that could have motivated me to exercise this week.  I had many opportunities to go for a quick run, take a short walk, or even just do a sit up.  And instead I found an unending supply of excuses _not_ to exercise.

And that's too bad.  Because just about everything I was dealing with this week and using as an excuse would have been made easier if I had just gotten out and moved my body a bit.  My anxiety, my stress about work, my frustrations with kids, my mild depression.  All of that eases up when I get out and get my blood pumping.

In sobriety, I've gotten pretty saavy at catching my addict brain whispering addict thoughts in my ear and that helps keep me sober.

I'm still not so saavy at catching my lethargic brain whispering lethargic thoughts in my ear.

How do you stay motivated or, better yet, how do you respond to those excuses when they crop up?

What are your goals for the week?  Want to brag about a recent Shape UP Success™? Need to talk through a disappointing Shape Up Snafu™?  Or just how are you doing?

No matter how it's going, sometimes I need to remind myself that, hey, I'm sober today and that's already a pretty good start to a healthy day.",44

I noticed a direct correlation between PMS and my binge drinking. The irritability and anger caused me to always go overboard. I felt like I was more pleasant to be around and I could tolerate other people better when I was drunk. This is my first time going through it sober. Man I was mad today and really wanted a drink. I read in a post how someone rage ate donuts recently and I could really relate. I've been rage pounding seltzer waters all day. I found if I put them in the freezer and get them super cold they are even more refreshing. That's my share today. Hope tomorrow is a little easier.

Sharing this because even tho I don’t want a drink right now, I feel like this constellation of symptoms sort of has been a trigger in the past. 

To deal — I took a long shower, gonna respond to some text messages and not isolate, gonna clean my apt, and order some good food. I’ll watch Star Trek voyager or play some video games or read. Anything. What I won’t do is put poison in my body. 40 days ago, I said adios to the devil and have no desire to return to hell anytime soon.

I was able to keep track of what was said and didn't make the whole night about me.

My wife was picking up some wine for herself and asked me if I wanted anything since the restaurant was a BYOB. I said I didn't want anything and it was the best decision I ever made. 

A dude I was talking to said our conversation gave him a different perspective and he was going to actually start living instead of just existing. He said my passion for life was contagious. I wasn't even trying to be anyone but myself .

What a night!

Thanks to all of you for being here and teaching me how to really live. My son and I drank the green tea I brought with me (2 tea bags) and it felt so good. Now I'm bringing my own green tea to restaurants and I don't even care!! So awesome!!

2021-11-06 22:16:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qoezkv/back_in_the_race/,Back in the race.,"Hi everyone!

After three years of sobriety I relapsed. It was...a long time coming. I got really isolated, and I got into a *really* bad place with my mental health. My last relapse where I was smoking a metric ton of medical marijuana really screwed my brain up in ways I didn't fully recognize at the time. I didn't have any insight into what was happening, but now that I've hit bottom with it, in hindsight, there were some significant, erm, errors in the way that I was thinking and perceiving the world that weren't there before I smoked all that weed. Now that I'm trying to figure out what the crap actually happened and looking into it, apparently smoking weed increases the chance of developing schizophrenia by 500%. There's mental illness and alcoholism on both sides of my family tree, and while I don't think that I developed schizophrenia or anything, I definitely did something to my brain smoking all that weed.

I didn't get honest about that with anyone. Not my psychiatrist, not my therapist, not my friends, not my AA sponsor. Like I said, I wasn't fully conscious of what was going on, but I also knew that there was stuff that I was glossing over and straight up not telling anyone about. I just carried it around with me and assumed that time would fix it. It didn't. It got worse.

When I first started trying to quit drinking I didn't know how to talk about what was going on with my drinking. I didn't actually know how to say, ""I'm drinking more than I want to and hiding a lot of it because I don't know what else to do, I don't know how to be alive in the world without it, and when I try to stop I can't. It's the only thing that feels good anymore and I'm afraid to lose it. But I hate it too. But I can't stop."" It's like that. I knew that my drinking was a problem but I genuinely didn't know how to put that into words or say it to anyone. 

And the idea of telling anyone was scary, because I assumed that the response would be ""Well, just don't drink like that anymore,"" or something to the effect. Anyway, I got in touch with a friend from AA this week and we've had some long talks about my mental health stuff and it's gone well. I'm getting in to see a psychiatrist and am recognizing that yes, I need more therapy. I dunno, it's daunting facing this stuff. But I have to. I've already tried not dealing with it, and I've tried just going back to drinking, but neither of those things have worked. So facing it is the only option I have left.

It's not like I thought that drinking was going to work for me, I know that I'm an alcoholic, but it *really* didn't work. It wasn't even the shit-show that I thought it would be (although, I'm sure that if I'd kept going, it would have ended up there.) It lasted a couple of weeks, no wild blackout benders. I was basically sitting on the couch in my dirty house drinking and watching TV and journaling about my new understanding of certain lines from [How It Works](https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/p-10_howitworks.pdf) and stuff I glossed over on my 5th step. For real. Worst relapse ever. 

There's a saying in AA to the effect of ""There's nothing worse than a belly full of beer and a head full of AA."" I can attest to that. You can't go home again. There's no way for me to unlearn what I've learned in recovery, there's no way for me to go back to a place where drinking is an escape. 

Anyway, my first AA meeting back I went with my friend to a meeting in her neighborhood, way on the other side of the city, partly so I could avoid seeing anyone who knows me so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone about what's been actually happening with me. And in classic AA fashion, the guy who was speaking at the meeting literally talked about exactly what I was doing, relapsing and then wanting to get sober again but not wanting to see people in AA who knew him, because they'd call him out on his shit. And then he talked about the importance of honesty, that it's the key to the AA program.

I have a half-baked theory that's probably mostly projection that that sort of deep, essential honesty is a big part of the reason why AA works for the people who it works for, and it's also a big part of the reason why a lot of people are turned off by AA. It's the main reason why I've been leery about AA over the years. The last time that I got sober and left AA it was because I didn't want to do a 4th step and face my childhood trauma. This time around there was a cluster of stuff from my more recent past that I didn't want to face. 

And I still totally don't want to face it, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to be sober if I'm not in AA, I just don't see the point. AA is pretty much what I like about sobriety. I recognize that that's not true for everyone and plenty of people find happy and meaningful lives in sobriety without it, and I sorta considered, ""Well, maybe I can just quit drinking and not go back,"" but, as deeply unsettling and outright threatening as I find that kind of honesty to be, I just don't want a life where I'm not in AA. It makes me happy to be a part of it, it's where I belong. It brings meaning and joy to my life in a way that nothing else ever has, the idea of a life where I'm not a part of AA seems colorless and empty and bleak. Maybe I could stay sober without it, I don't know, but I don't want to. I like who I am when I'm active in AA, that's where I belong.

So yeah. That's where I am. I was proud of my three years of sobriety, but I realize now that it sorta doesn't matter how much time I have in sobriety, what matters is where I am at today, right now, in this instant. And where I am is not where I want to be. Not because I can count the days that I've been sober without running out of fingers, but because I'm at a place where I'm not honest or connecting with others or living a life where I can be of service to other people who are struggling with the same things that I've struggled with.

There's a [Fugazi song](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cTDZLMM22hw) that has particular resonance for me in recovery. 

*The farther I go, the less I know. One foot in front of the other. It all boils around to not hanging around, to keep moving in front of the gravity.*

*The answer is there, the answer is there. But ""there"" is not a fixed position. It keeps moving along, and I keep coming along. That's why I'm a long distance runner.*

*And if I stop to catch my breath I might catch a piece of death. I can't keep your pace if I want to finish this race.*

*My fight's not with you, it's with gravity.*

It's a long distance race, but I'm a long distance runner. I *really* wish I wasn't making this post, but it's reality. Sending hugs to all my SD peeps.

  Do you avoid many social situations?  I’m trying to be less of a hermit and have been going to meetup groups.  Went to volleyball and kickball!  I have about a year sober now.

I’m kind of nervous about specifically going out for drinks after the game though tomorrow.  I’m naturally kind of shy, which sort of started my alcoholism when younger and I don’t want to start feeling nervous and uncomfortable at this bar or wherever we go.

Tricky thing is that I really do want to make friends I’m single and kind of a loner besides the people I interact with at work.

2021-11-06 21:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qoe3ez/some_good_news_on_my_cravings/,Some good news on my cravings,"Just checking in with a little encouragement for some of you.  I'm almost a year in and I realized that the cravings have really diminished.  I really struggled after the first couple months, and then again there was a spike of sorts at around six months, but I think my body has finally gotten used to not having alcohol.  

I had some very vivid cravings where I could see, smell, taste the booze and I even had to check into this kind sub a few times for support to get past those.  I also had multiple ""drinking dreams"". 
 Those physical-dependency type thoughts have eventually eased and I'm finding it easier to just accept being booze-free as my normal state.

However, I say this with one caution.  My brain, it seems, is tricky.  There is a kind of remnant there which has taken a subtler, trickier form.  Sometimes I get the feeling now that ""Maybe things weren't that bad actually, and having a nice glass of wine with a meal or a fine scotch in the evening would be ok.""  Thanks, brain.  Anyway be on the lookout for this, friends.

Still in any case, progress is progress, and for those of you feeling that the cravings won't ease, just wanted to give you some hope that things can improve.  IWNDWYT.",7

It's September 2020.  I had just turned 32.  I finished college 2 weeks before the lockdowns and my industry went to almost compete shutdown.  I let myself fall off the cliff and used covid as the excuse.

I was depressed, had occasional suicidal thoughts, had no direction in life, and drank almost every day.  I was drifting from city to city as a nomad, working gig jobs to pay my way.  This wasn't all bad.  I got to see some cool stuff and gained a love for nature.  But I made no friends along the way.  Alcohol was my closest ""friend"".

My poison was craft beer and wine.  I justified it by saying I'm ""drinking the good stuff"" and that ""I'm only having 2 or 3 drinks"".  In reality, it was often more than that.

* A time of transition

September 2020 changed my life.  I wandered my way into the Pacific Northwest.  Something just changed for me.  It was largely a spiritual experience that I won't get into too much here.  A tiny sliver of hope and positively emerged in me and I latched onto it with everything I had.

I asked myself a very simple question:  Is this life worth continuing if I can't take care of myself?

After a few days of sitting on that question, I made a commitment to living a fulfilling life.

It took me a week to go to zero alcohol.  Then I went to zero cannabis.  I even went to zero caffeine for a short period.  I stopped eating fast food.  I started cooking for myself.  **Most importantly**, I took time for myself every single day.  I find peace in writing and meditating.

* A new life and living in peace

I was originally going to be in Washington for a week.  I did my gig work there and realized I was making nearly double my previous income.  This was partially because of the local economy.  But more importantly, it was because I simply cared to try harder.  

That week turned into 3 weeks.  After 3 weeks, I went to my previous ""home base"" and sold/donated 90% of my belongings.  I put the rest in my car and moved to Washington.

* A new life and a better future

That was 14 months ago.  I had just turned 32 years old and had never truly lived in all that time.

Now, I have started my career, work a 2nd job, and still have extra energy due to taking care of my mind and body.  My income is the highest it's ever been and I may be able to double it in 2022.

I started working out and am in the best shape of my life.  I weigh less now than I did in high school.  I am running a half marathon next month.  I became an avid hiker and am going to lead nature tours next summer.  I started doing yoga to heal old injuries and prevent new ones.

I am making real efforts to have deep connections with other people.  Covid makes this hard, but there's always a way if you stay positive and put in the effort.  People will gravitate toward you if you project positivity into the world.

I've also committed to start dating again once my work schedule calms down in a few months.  I want to find a partner to share my life with.  Maybe I still have time to have kids.  My old self would hate the thought of that.  Now I can't wait to get out there and try. 

* Conclusion

I took a day off from my side job and took time to appreciate how far I've come.  If I can do it, you can too.  You got this!  Be proud of yourself, love yourself, forgive yourself if you slip up, and always look for the positive side of things when you're feeling down.

You're all beautiful.  I won't drink with you tonight, or ever.",192

Not sure how to help (or if it's my place to) but it irks me how other people are reacting to it,"Recently, right around when I finally celebrated my first year sober, we got an influx of new temp employees at work to help with the busy season. A couple days after they started one of my coworkers went up to me and said that one of the shippers smelled strongly of booze and was acting really nervous/jittery. Then, a few days later she claimed that she actually saw her drinking from a small, clear bottle at her work station and acted really startled when she went over there, almost like she hadn't expected someone to see her. 

By now she's brought it up to a few of us and everyone has been laughing and making jokes about drinking on the job. ""Hope that's just water in your water bottle."" ""I'm not drunk, I'm just tired, unlike some people."" They've even gone on to refer to her as ""Drinky"" instead of by her name. I've brought up that she probably has a serious problem, but they kinda just shrug it off. That problem, to them, is nothing more than the butt of a joke. 

I find it really sad. If this woman is drinking at work, especially if she's acting ""jittery"", she likely has a really serious problem and it isn't funny or laughable. I don't work around her, but I say hello to her when we pass by each other and she seems like a really nice person. She always waves and smiles, and is overall very friendly.

Years ago I was in a similar boat. During our busy season we would work 12 hour shifts, so I'd have 3-4 days at home by myself. Often times I'd binge drink up until the last day, then be too hungover to go to work without drinking more. I'm surprised no one brought it up because there was no way I was fooling people in the way I thought I was. It must've been so obvious. People would always comment how I looked tired and sick all the time. It was pure hell living that way and if I had known people were laughing about me behind my back while I was struggling, it would've been devastating. 

I'm not really sure it's my place to reach out to her, but I at least want to be kind towards her if she's in that kind of situation.

There wasn't much of a point to this story, I guess. I'm frustrated by how ""normal"" people treat alcoholics. I'm frustrated by this disease overall. But I also feel blessed to be in a place where I can see so clearly where I was and appreciate how great things are now with sobriety.",29

The next year I was constantly trying to get sober but when I'd fuck up I'd punish myself and give up and go on crazy binge drinking experiences. Most of the reason was to self medicate my social anxiety. This year I've stuck to my guns. I've not drank since Valentines Day & I stuck to a single glass. I'm so fucking proud of myself. I feel so much better physically and mentally. I still get anxious in public at music events and such where booze are. I get that eerie temptation of, ""oh well one wouldn't hurt... I probably look weird not drinking."" & unfortunately I have had people actually make comments and try to push me to drink, or be very rude about it. I've lost and cut so many people out of my life who weren't supportive of me quitting. I was so sad and hurt at first, but I've learned they were never my friends & I'm much better without them.

Last night I pushed myself to be social and face my agoraphobia, left my house and challenged myself to socialize. After an art event I went to an old bar I used to like. I knew it would be a challenge and a trigger. I've no desire to go to any other old bar that I used to. I specifically wanted to go to this one because it was a chill social environment full of other needs like myself whod cosplay, geek out over movie marathons, video games, local artists, LGBT, drag shows etc. A small place run by the kindest French man who'd welcome and chat to anyone who walked through the door. They were celebrating their 6 year anniversary of staying open through covid. I was so worried they'd shut down, as it was one of the most welcoming places I'd ever been. I went, and at midnight they handed out free champagne to everyone. I felt anxious. I was able to deny it. They weren't weird about it, they didn't ask why not, they simply offered a non alcoholic drink as they said everyone deserves to feel  included, alcohol or not. That was the first time I've ever had that happen. Where I wasn't treated rudely, wasn't pushed past my limits, wasn't asked why not, no judgement, they just smiled at me, treated me like a person and offered me something else. I was so caught off guard. I kinda wanted to cry. It was so nice. Then we all cheered and talked about our nerdy interests. 

I'm so glad to have a safe inclusive area like that I've always enjoyed to still welcome me back in with open arms. Some even recognized me and said welcome back and didn't ever pressure me to drink. I just needed that so much. To know that there are people in the real world like that.",14

I also have started drinking right before social gatherings when I know I'm not in an extroverted mood.

Today I fully admitted to myself that I have been abusing alcohol. Then I admitted it on my private twitter account. And after some incognito browsing, I'm here to introduce myself to this community. 

I'm 26 F, am heavily involved in my local punk music scene, and my full time job is online sex work. Alcohol just seems to be everywhere I look. 

My dad is a lifelong alcoholic (still going strong) whose addiction to booze, gambling, and lying led to my parents splitting up when I was 6. My mom's mom bitched to me about my dad's alcoholism when I was 10. I had no idea and it scared me shitless. I wasn't shpposed to share that information with my younger brother, who managed to spend most of his childhood blissfully unaware. Big burden to put on a 5th grader. 

I spent my youth as a goody-two-shoes 4.0 GPA honors kid. Didn't have alcohol or attend parties where it was available. I had my first drink on my 21st birthday and thought ""I made it, I didn't do what my dad did!"". *jeopardy buzzer noise* 

The last two years, I've been growing more and more concerned about my drinking habits. My therapist told me she was worried about me drinking more than the recommended 7 units a week. I cried so hard after that appointment that I threw up. The shame around being perceived as having any sort of problem or misbehaving absolutely consumes me. I'm sick of that feeling.

Last night, I was at a show & drank a bit. Not enough to be blitzed, but enough to feel social and a little goofy with my friends. My partner was DD, and we went to one of my friends' houses for a small after party gathering. I was inside for about 2 minutes before I realized I had to get fresh air (we're all religious about masking in my social circle, so I needed to take it off). 

My partner came outside to check on me and I asked to leave early because I felt a little sick. Then I politely and quietly threw up outside of their car before they drove me home. I felt fine physically, but SHAME. Shame shame shame. 

I don't want to have those moments of shame anymore. The moments turn into days and the days turn into weeks. That is not how I'd like to experience the rest of my 20s or 30s or 70s...

I digress.

After spending my entire day scrolling through this sub and reading post after post, I am feeling empowered & a lot less scared about this journey. 

Thank you for reading, and thank you for being here.

Almost all my social life has revolved around alcohol. I am a 'functional alcoholic' (not sure how I feel about that phrase) with a career and steady home life. 

A few years ago, I was concerned about the damage I knew alcohol was doing to my body and read somewhere that the liver can pretty much fully recover in one month (not sure of the accuracy of that). I decided to take a month off drinking and then I ended up taking another month off again later that year. I've been taking 2 months off a year in 1 month stints ever since. 

Here are my observations and strategies that help me get through the month each time. 

1. The first 2-4 days are the hardest. The cravings are worse at the times I would normally drink (after work/evenings). For me it feels like it is impossible to sleep and I sweat a crazy amount at night. I still somehow feel more energized throughout the day, though, even with almost no sleep. 
2. I need to get rid of all the alcohol in my house and replace it with non-alcoholic drinks, non-alcoholic beer, soda water, juice, kombucha, and all kinds of other tasty beverages or else all I will think about is drinking the alcohol that is in the house. I also smoke a lot more weed when I don't drink and that helps immensely.
3. I always lose at least a little weight (and then gain it back after starting drinking again) even though I allow myself to eat and drink whatever else I want besides alcohol over the course of the month. After a few days of not drinking, I feel energized and love to workout. 
4. The 'pink cloud' is REAL. It is probably connected to more sleep and exercise, but man it's almost surreal how happy I am sometimes when not drinking. I also perform better at work, I am more creative, and I feel more confident. 
5. One month of not drinking saves me about $600, maybe more. 
6. My true friends want to hang out sober, and it has changed my relationships with people for the better - we're not just 'drinking buddies' anymore. For the friends that I cannot imagine hanging out with sober, I just don't make plans with them when I'm not drinking. I think it would be a tough decision if I ever decide to stop drinking entirely whether I need to cut those 'drinking buddies' off entirely as well.

I also want to say thank you to all of you on the subreddit. You've helped me more than you know to get through my non-drinking months. There are so many benefits that I've seen while not drinking that I'm sure, one day, I'll be back telling you all why I'm stopping for good!

Now I am out at a birthday party with my group of friends who know that I’m sober. Dinner was so good and we’re getting ready to play cards against humanity. 

I always kill this game in the beginning but as I get drunker I get less funny. I’m excited to see how I play without alcohol in me. I’m also excited to be able to pay attention to what’s going on and actually understand the jokes. 

I’m also glad to know that I won’t be crying in my car later because I’m drunk and sad. I can end this shitty day on a high note instead of a low one.

since then it was quite easy to not think about drinking, i even stopped counting the days im sober. but today were one of the days were i catched myself thinking about drinking again in the future. and i know thats okay, i dont *really* want it, so i dont put that much meaning to it. but thats not the main point of this thread lol

some minutes ago i was daydreaming about a situation where i meet a 'friend' of mine and tell him that i stopped drinking and how weird it would be because i never met him sober. i thought about what we would talk and tried to remember what we talked about the last time we met. aaaand i dont have a fucking clue. we were chilling for 12 hours or so and i can remember 2 things or so he told me. i got so wasted that night that i rarely have any memories. and the times we met before it were the same, i *know* that we always talked much but i cant remember anything. and thats the same with a lot of other people. i can barely remember the job of some old 'friends' i met twice a week to drink with for some *months*?? thats pathetic

yeah i hope my daydream wont come true, because i would be afraid to ask him *anything* because maybe i asked that before lol

I managed 27 days 20 hours, the longest i have done since i can remember. I would get urges to drink when my triggers came such as arguments with my partner, or perhaps my day didnt go as well, i didnt achieve as much as i wanted and remembered how i used to fix my sadness with alcohol. I fought the urges so much, but ultimately i failed when it comes to my partner going out and getting to drink or do drugs. I feel left out, and like I cant particpate. I have social anxiety, and abused alcohol with it. So many people who knew me drunk would tell you I came across too confident and didnt believe i had anxiety because i would drink til blackout drunk, i done so many things that just arent me. sober me is so different


Although drunk me isnt who i want to be, she has aspects of it, she is bold, confident, happy. I am the opposite sober. I liked my new life of calmness, productivity and some peace but i felt i was still missing something. Deep down i want to socialize with people, but i feel so unbareably uncomfortable doing so unless friends/family from 10 years ago. 


My partner was out to get high with a friend and i resisted the urge until i didnt. now i have ordred alcohol, then cigarettes (i only get urges to smoke when drink so thats another bad habit added) then now alcohol again. 


I am not enjoying it really. But i didnt enjoy being sober. and im sitting here so lonely and crying. so confused. i dont want to be sober. i dont want to be drunk. 


I dont know what else to say. I like being drunk i think because i have confidence to reach out to people, even if they are false friendships or w.e. sober i lock myself away (bar my husband, parents, and 1 friend) and im even more so lonely ",10

&#x200B;

Last night, I \*really\* wanted a drink. I had the house to myself (optimal drinking conditions for me), and my mom-in-law's tequila (my old vice) was calling my name hard from her bedroom. I've done so well lately, and the little voice whispering that I deserved a reward was incessant.    

&#x200B;

BUT, I thought about tomorrow, and how I would feel. I thought about the bargain I was making, the trade-off. Then, I thought about what I would even get out of it; a few hours of fun and blissful, numb stupidity at best, in exchange for at least 24 hours of anxiety, distress, discomfort, and fatigue. Finally, I asked myself why I even wanted that in the first place?    

&#x200B;

I ended up not having that drink. I stayed up a little too late watching Youtube and eating ice cream instead. Today, I woke up feeling good, refreshed, fairly healthy, and so grateful for the decision I made last night.    

&#x200B;

Can I ask what caused you to stop?  

My story -- I started drinking heavily to self medicate about 5 years ago ... as a way to self medicate in an abusive relationship.   Now, I'm out of the relationship but I still have an issue with my drinking.

I was drinking 1.5 to 2 bottles of wine a day.  I am self employed so I was starting early and drinking throughout the day/evening.  I deal with anxiety and a high stress business and I was drinking to calm myself down.

Recently, I started to drink enough to black out. My 15 year old son would tell me that I was asking questions that he already answered the night before....

Stopping alcohol was definitely the right decision. I'm back on track!","This is not going to be the usual self-flagellation post when one of us relapses. 

I had a super stressful week, I was bored alone and antsy on my couch, and didn't know what to do. The stars were aligned for me to buy wine. I went to the convenience store and bought my usual 50cl bottle of red wine. 

I never was a binge drinker, just a consistent drinker who was waiting all day for that one 50cl bottle of wine. I had been free of that feeling for the past three weeks, but relapsed yesterday. 

Do I feel bad about it? Not really, strangely. I knew I was fucking up when I bought it so I don't want to be a hypocrite and feel bad about it now. It was a stupid idea, and I knew it. No need to cry over spilled milk.

The part that kinda pissed me off about it is how underwhelming it was. First of all, wine tastes almost like vinegar. I guess my taste buds are more sensitive to it now. Second, I didn't even get buzzed. I just had this acid liquid sitting in my stomach, 10 dollars less in my bank account, and I was not even drunk. 

At the first sip, I realized it would be a shitty experience. I still drank it all, though. I woke up feeling shittier than usual, went to the gym dragging my feet. Some guy from a dating app saw me at the gym and came to talk to me and I was not having it. When I used to drink, I remember feeling like that all day every day. 

It's pretty clear that completely stopping wine was the right thing to do. It's poison for me. Even a little bit of poison is still more poison than I should ingest. My life has been improving so much since I stopped wine and pot. I just have to keep plowing through. 

Two steps forward one step back.

Have a great week-end, my friends.",107

My badge is correct, but reflects a relapse that happened when lockdown ended in my area. I had moved during the pandemic, hardly knew anyone in my area, and just wanted to make friends and be ""normal.""   

I learned a lot from that, and was relieved I was able to get my shit together again. 

This past weekend I was visiting the city I used to live in. A group of us went out to a bar; I got ginger ale and no one noticed or commented, which I think has to do in part with me no longer noticing or caring that I'm not drinking alcohol though others around me are.   
   
The next day I had an invitation to hang out with an acquaintance for tea, and said acquaintance later brought me to a gathering with a different, super great group of people, some leaders in my creative field who I was really excited to get to talk to. Smart, inspiring, funny, actualized people who have their shit together. None of whom were drinking. I somehow feel I wouldn't have been invited in my drinking days, even if I'd been sober at the time of hanging out. I think that's because when I was drinking a lot my energy was dimmed and different and I was attracting different things.   

It came up later that one of those people at the gathering was also in recovery (with, I think, decades sober), figured out that I also am, and gave me a really genuine ""good for you."" I haven't been super open about my sobriety or told many people, and for whatever reason that affirmation felt especially meaningful and good. Finally it feels like a new, more compatible world is opening to me in my sobriety, rather than just feeling like I have to navigate my old booze-soaked social world as a newly sober person or be perpetually lonely. For the first time, I conceived of my life story in a way where my substance use disorder could be an isolated chapter in the past. It felt amazing. Thanks for letting me share! Love you all.

In late lockdown I leaned into the abstinence. Why not? I didn’t have any social engagements to attend, I didn’t have to ‘fit in’ with anyone, my only concern was getting a good night sleep and exercising. It was easy.

A lot of treatment centers talk about medication when quitting cold turkey, but I don’t get withdrawal symptoms so I’m not if that’s the best approach?

The bad news is I’m currently feeling the strongest urge I have so far. I’m currently a caregiver for my mother who has dementia (while my father is in the hospital recovering from open heart surgery). She had a really bad #2 accident in her diaper this morning. I’ll spare you the details, but I had to clean her up and shower her, and because it got everywhere, I had to clean the bathroom up after as well. Then I had to try to scramble to take a shower for myself while she was laying down. 

I usually have her bathroom schedule very regimented, but I just messed up this morning. I am so stressed and I want nothing more than to just have one drink to ease the stress. I lit some incense, and rubbed some eucalyptus under my nose and made myself a cup of tea while distracting myself by writing this post.

I feel so low and like everything in life is too heavy for me to handle. Please someone, anyone, just tell me I’m doing a good job as I am in tears currently.

I’m just a dude trying his best.",83

People used to say life was better sober, and I never believed them. Even when I first stopped drinking, it took a while for all the “good things” to start happening. 

I’m disappointed it took me until a car accident and DUI to stop drinking. I think of how much easier my life would be if I didn’t spend a majority of it wasted. 2 years ago today I was on the brink of divorce, failing my undergrad, depressed, and penniless. I’ve now begun grad school, have repaired my marriage, welcomed a beautiful baby boy (who knew alcohol effected your fertility), and have a job I love. I no longer spend the days wishing I weren’t alive. Still penniless but coping better 😂

For a little background, I'm in my mid 20s and I tend to binge drink. I don't go all out every time, but I can easily go all out. One night I'd have 10 glasses of wine, the next few nights I'd have 4 until I have 10 again. I get cravings at night time when I'm bored. I have a hard time going to sleep without a drink. I've gained weight during covid from drinking. I drink too often with my partner. 

It's come to the point where as I'm getting older, I'm noticing alcohol everywhere in my life. I notice problem drinking in myself, my partner, my extended family, and just everywhere I go because I'm carrying it with me. And the thing I'm struggling the most with, after admitting to myself that I need to be sober and quit going on like this, is the constant self doubt! 

I doubt the legitimacy or urgency of everything I just wrote down, like every single hour of the day. My brain is always telling me ""nahhh it's not that bad, you're young, it's not affecting your life that negatively, and besides you have fun when you drink! You're not a mean drunk, and it's normal to drink often in America"" and these thoughts are so powerful. They feel strong enough for me to want to grab a drink or order one at lunch. 

But then it's like I have the fucking angel of truth on my other shoulder saying, ""your family has a history of alcoholism, you wake up feeling like shit, your sleep schedule is always fucked, you've gained 30 pounds from wine calories, you want a drink every night, your partner and you drink too much together, your mom is concerned about the amount you drink in one night sometimes.... These are all signals!!! Stop ignoring them!!!! You're slipping further and further down this hole, and right now is the time to recognize it"" 

So... Yeah.  I don't know if I would fit in at AA or not. I'm not at the point where I could see myself going, but maybe that's bullshit. But I do know for sure that I really want to do this. 


Thanks for hearing me out! I'm choosing to not drink today",14

This is a decision I am making not because I have to but because I want to. It's ok to say no and not drink, I'm so much better off for it.

I want to be there for my family. My buddy is recovering (in AA) and has been a great help to get me to where I am today w/ accepting my struggle.

I’ve recently made myself a fool again at a work event by drinking too much and now worry about being fired for it.  I could tell more stories but I’m sure you all can relate. 

I’m worried that since I’ve been in this spot before it will all happen again but I’ve learned (and started to) not keep booze in the house (that helps). 

I do have new hope though. Two new things I’ve never done to stop are setting up an appt w/ a therapist and the big one, I’ve decided to go to my first AA meeting this weekend. I don’t know if AA will work for me but I’ll take anything at this point and it’s a step in the right direction which I feel good about. These three things also show a change hopefully. 1. A focus on everyday 2. managing the feelings that drive me to drink 3. Know when my weak times are (weekends and social events)

I woke up in the morning and I was kind of blown away by it.

Prior to this I was still drinking in my dreams fairly frequently. I would wake up in the morning convinced that I had drank the previous night, and for the first few minutes of being awake I would be coaching myself that just because I had drank the previous night does not mean I need to slide back into old habits. Then I would eventually realize that I had a distinct memory of what actually happened the previous night and that it did not involve drinking at all. In a way, it was especially confusing because binge drinking and being in a dream state are both ways which you lose your short term memory, so even though I couldn't recall the specifics I was sure I had drank the previous night until I was a bit more clear headed. 

Anyways, this isn't really a milestone that anyone has any control over, and I'm sure I will probably have dreams in the future where I accept the drink because that's kind of just how the subconcious works when it comes to habits. But I just wanted to share it with a community of people who would understand the significance of it.

In 2021, I'm concerned with my alcohol use.","I am a 26 year old male. At age 14 I started smoking marijuana, and by age 16 I was taking oxycodone, xanax, and klonopin. Over the next 5 years I entered a state of pure hell driven by mental illness and severe drug addiction, and by 19 I was injecting heroin and cocaine. 

A long series of events lead me to enter into sober living at the end of 2016 until 2018 and I remained clean from heroin, but I did however resume smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. 

Over the last 3 years I have had a strange, up and down relationship with alcohol. Sometimes I can go weeks or even months without drinking. More recently, I've found myself drinking nearly every day, with small breaks in between. Normally at night following work, but more recently I've wandered into some day drinking on my off days. 

I went through an incredibly difficult breakup this year. I was cheated on and then she left me for that guy and I never knew and had to find out later. After that, I began drinking far more often. 

I believe that I am developing patterns and habits that eventually lead to full blown alcoholism. I know this, and accept it, but I am finding it hard to stay away and at the recommendation of another Reddit user, I decided to come here and tell my story and try and find some support I'm clearly missing in my life to be able to get this under control. 

Thanks for listening. I really do not want this to become a problem that leads me back anywhere near where I was in 2016, so I think it's time to address it now.

A third night in a row of uninterrupted sleep. Woke up without agitation. Anxiety was pretty much gone. A very occasional head pressure here and there but overall a solid day. 

Had a drinking dream — that I didn’t think and started chugging vodka. It was almost automatic. Until I realized what I’ve done and started freaking out. Woke up feeling like I just had a nightmare and so relieved at the same time. 

I’m starting to have the “why not”  thoughts too. Was alone on a Friday night for a few hours and the thought of drinking came briefly. I think it’s a sign that my body is healing. Last time I relapsed after I started feeling really good. 

Headed off to a long bike ride today with a group. Gonna be fun!

[edited]My point is drinking is miserable, causing unwanted drama, making self esteem low.

I'll start in high school.  I was a smart kid, top of my class, but always felt so uncomfortable. I also was being emotionally abused and manipulated at home. I was 16 when I brought my first water bottle full of vodka to school. I shared it with my other friend. It was fun. We did that here and there through that entire year. I didn't drink again until I was 21. 

When I was 21 I realized I loved how I felt when I drank. I talked more, I was less shy, and I felt comfortable.  I felt worthy. I also realized drinking brought some serious repressed anger to the surface.  Screaming, yelling and punching holes in walls was the norm. I was angry at the world and the day after I always had apologies to hand out. One night (22 years old) I realized I was drunk and Screaming at my roommate, slamming my hand against the wall, and I came down and realized I was out of control.  I stayed somewhere else that night and got in therapy the next day for my Anger Problem because it wasn't the alcohol.  


I found ways to manage my anger, but surprisingly it didn't help. At 22 I was in a car with my same roommate, I was drunk, and she wouldn't let me out of the car, so I jumped out as the car was going 35 mph. I was lucky.  I realize that now. I walked away with some bumps and bruises.  It took me 3 more years to realize I had a problem with alcohol and 2 more years to get here... 62 days. There we other signs. Other things. Lying. Sneaking. Obsessing. Blaming. But I realized I had a problem when I was drinking 8 to 9 IPAs a day and didn't really care about anything or anyone more than I cared about getting drunk.

Anyway.  Stay buckled up in cars my sober friends, don't jump out, and let's get another 24 hours in. IWNDWYT!",15

Ive been wondering if it's worth it, if I can moderate, why I can't just let loose and have fun like all of my friends etc. Last night was the worst, I went to a party and a show with my bf and friends and was the only one who didn't drink. I also forgot to bring non alcoholic beer and weed so I just felt bored and weird doing drinking games with water. I wanted to post here and ask if anybody fell off the wagon after three years. 

I had a few sips of my bfs beer throughout the night and then when I went home and went to bed I had a dream where a sip turned into half a drink which turned into several drinks and then I was off the wagon and extremely upset about it.

I’ve not long woken up and went through my normal routine. Massaged my throbbing head, scrolled through my phone to see if I sent any stupid messages to anybody (I didn’t thankfully) and asked my wife if she’s ok, which has unfortunately become my shorthand way of asking “did I do or say anything ridiculous last night / have I pissed you off or upset you?) 

A success as far as my Saturday mornings go really. 

I’m scrolling through SD and enjoying the thread about the guy who went out with a serial killer and my mind wandered off. As a preface to this little tale: I absolutely hate asparagus. 

My wife is one of those aforementioned serial killer type people. And she likes gin. She will buy a bottle of gin, have one glass then leave it sitting in the cupboard for weeks or months before having any more. It works out well actually because I also hate gin, so it’s safe for her to have because anything else she could buy, after I’d finished all the drinks I’d bought for myself, I’d then finish her bottle of wine, vodka, or whatever else she had bought and looked forward to having. That is of course, unless I didn’t have any other option. If I had nothing else I’d make myself a glass of 1/2 gin and 1/2 whatever mixer I could find, which has been tap water in desperate times, and force it down for the sake of getting some alcohol in me.

And for some reason, this hypothetical thought popped into my head. If I was hungry, and opened the fridge and for some ungodly reason there was nothing but asparagus in there, I wouldn’t force it down just for the sensation of being full, I just wouldn’t bother. I think it has just clicked in my mind how much alcohol has control of me. 

I have already told my wife that I’m not going to drink today, and now I’m telling all you guys too. We’re planning on going for a walk in town, and later I’m going to make a chai latte and watch a Spider-Man movie. The dirty gins can stay in the cupboard.

So following her recommendation I went to some online AA meetings but they really made me feel miserable. I hate the word alcoholic. Yes I am an alcoholic but that is not what defines me, and my recovery is about making more space for the other things I am. Can I start the session by saying hello I am error and today I am an athlete, an artist, a friend and a fucking good person? I also hate the idea of being powerless and needing a higher power - this just rings alarms bells for me. I am the one who made the decision to keep coming back after failed attempts, I am the one who is here committing not to drink. I do have a choice and I am not powerless. I can lean on communities and seek help but the power is in my hands at the end of the day.

I would like to see my alcohol abuse from a place of self love. I started drinking for reasons that made sense at the time. But now it no longer serves me and so I need to focus on other hobbies and habits. That doesn't make alcohol inherintely bad, just bad for me.

I'm rambling now. I don't mean to criticise AA because i know it works for other people but I don't think it is for me. Does anyone have any recommendations for group therapy / recovery programs that don't make me hate myself?",7

Yesterday I was told, following an ultrasound investigation into upper abdominal pain that, among other things, I have fatty liver disease - most likely caused by alcoholism and obesity. I'm 31 (F) and have been drinking heavily since 15. I wish I could go back in time and slap my best friends Mum silly for supplying us with alcohol. I wish I could have slapped my parents silly for normalising daily drinking. That I could slap myself silly when I was 19 and started to hide the two bottles of red wine I was drinking each day when I was living at home, and never asking for help. almost two decades of childhood trauma culminated in more than a decade of alcoholism, which I thought I had shaken off in 2019 following treatment, but which slowly crept back in over the last year since our kitten was incorrectly diagnosed with a terminal condition (he is fine now!).  

My younger brother took his life in June, which sent me into a downward spiral of confusion, self-hatred and brought up so much childhood trauma, that I really wasn't expecting (and thought I had dealt with). Some days I have just felt numb when I think about the fact that he felt so bad about his life he thought he'd be better in the ground - other days I fall apart, can't come to terms with things, and it takes me days to pull myself back together. I was supposed to graduate from my degree this semester, I had 4 units left. But I can't even sit at a desk or read anything that requires my full attention for longer than a few minutes, before horrible thoughts start creeping in. A few weeks ago I put my degree on hold to work on myself. 

I have a second appointment in 2 days with a counsellor for the grief, she also specialises in drug and alcohol counselling. I'm going to talk with her about coping mechanisms for drinking, but today is day one, I'm not waiting until then to stop.

For the last decade I've used drinking to escape, I've taken advantage of my health, and have driven my body into the ground. Right until the moment the words ""fatty liver disease"" came out of my doctors mouth, I was walking down a path that was going to take me into an early grave. Today, I feel empowered. I will no longer choose to knowingly harm my body, my mental health, my fertility, my future. I'm going to continue to post here to keep myself accountable, at least until the cravings have slowed down.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

All We Can Do

Gooooood morning Stop Drinking! 

For the final time this week, I invite you to make a  commitment to staying alcohol free with me for the next 24 hours. I’ve been really grateful for the opportunity to host the Check-In again and I’d like to thank you all for your participation and comments, I’ve read every single one, and I’m happy and thankful to have learned both from you, and about you all.

I’d like to leave you with a quote from Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains, that was passed on to me by another sobernaut, on a day when I was struggling greatly with feelings of inadequacy. I keep this quote on my wall and remind myself of it daily. It has helped me immeasurably - to not compare myself with others, to accept my limitations, to be glad for what I have, to be more comfortable in my own skin and with my own efforts. It reminds me to be kinder to myself, that my abilities,  strengths and weaknesses are better some days more than others, and that I will always be a work in progress.   

**»I’m doing the best I can with what I’ve got.»**

And that’s all any one of us can do.

I will not drink with you today. Bon week-end!",401

Dopamine after drinking is downregulated, other activities feel less rewarding and can’t compete with the massive amounts released by drinking. Wanting other things is underrepresented. -> will change after dopamine starts flowing in other things and NOT in alcohol, it takes time, give it time

Wanting other things requires doing them. The dopamine has to flow in them before subconsciously wanting them. Physical exercise is paramount in it’s ability to release dopamine and endorphines (this is what monkeys are meant to do, move around, strive hard towards something, the body rewards the monkey for doing so, the monkey feels good afterwards and wants more). Give it time, it takes some time to kick in.

Hit the gym, run, etc. no matter if you hate it, change that, it will prove its benefits and you start to love the process of doing good to yourself.

Start to build things up with wisdom, doing things that are both objectively beneficial (supports your life by research and facts) and subjectively beneficial (strengthens emotional life)

Alcohol objectively has a negative value, it’s an expensive, addictive poison and during drinking it very little objectively beneficial things happen that aren’t just a chemical illusion. I mean, strip all emotion out of it and you see there’s nothing important going on. It’s subjectively more harmful than enjoyable, the hangovers and addiction caused by it are emotionally a lot bigger pile of crap than the pleasure it provided.

It has a negative value to life, it eats away things and you see it in people who drink it, they drink poison.

I miss it a bit. I miss the idea of it. I miss the idea of loosening up over a few drinks and having a good time. But like so many of us the good times got boring and then after they got boring they got bad. Addiction is no joke. 

I have enough sober steaks and days here and there to know that I am so much happier when I don’t drink. Even social situations where drinking would be expected are better when I only have water. 

I am so much more present. I can look up at the sky and appreciate the stars fully and completely. I can watch the faces of the people around me and not be in my head wondering what they think of me. I don’t have to count drinks to make sure I’m not making an ass of myself or risking a DUI. 

I moderated for 10 months before I decided to do this. And I needed those 10 months to feel out my boundaries and compare drinking me to sober me. And sober me is much happier. The grief I occasionally feel is nothing compared the the bleakness of active addiction. 

If you are still wondering if this is worth it, it is. It seems so scary until you actually make the decision. Then it’s lighter than a feather. 

I’m looking forward to picking up my 30-day chip way more than I EVER looked forward to the first drink of my day.

He's in hospital right now, he is in pain but he's going to be fine. He's always been pretty much in control of his drinking, unlike me: never gone to rehab, never lost a job cos of his drinking, never crashed his car, has a great career, a beautiful fiance, quite wealthy, and definitely drinking less now than at our peak in our twenties.

Yet this has still caught up with him. I was so worried yesterday, even though we arent friends anymore. We had lots of good times and I used to consider him like an elder brother.

I am not going to drink today. What a reminder of how toxic alcohol is. As ""this naked mind"" puts it. This is a toxic poison that adds no value to life. I am happy I sobered up when I did. It could have been me in that hospital bed tonight.

EDIT:Just got home and managed to not drink! Thanks so much for helping me through this. The comments all helped so much. Now I know my limits for next time. I thought that consistency was working for me and that if I stuck to my coping routine it would work for the entire event, but I learned the value in variety now especially when dealing with long obligations. I wanted to list the helpful things people suggested that got me through it because I haven't had a hard night like this in a while and it was tough and frightening, so if it helps others that would be really awesome:

1) take a step out for fresh air, splash some water on your face in the bathroom to refresh, or  strike up conversation with the staff and crew about the restaurant or the food to stall for time

2) focus on your role as designated driver, if not drinking for you isn't motivating in the moment then do it for the people around you. I chose to repeat it to myself every once and a while when I felt myself looking at the drinks menu

3) plan your hangover-free day. I distracted myself by planning tomorrow's to do list on my phone and googling fun activities to do over the weekend

4) variety, switch up the sober drinks and mix in food so you have something to enjoy that wont get boring

5) it's ok to leave early. In this instance I couldnt, but now I know I might not be suitable for the designated driver role, because it can entail staying in a triggering environment for too long. Next time I'll set up a back up plan/back up driver so I dont back myself into a corner again.",61

It’s really been working well, I’d say. I haven’t drank at all this month (so, 5 days), when normally the most I can go is two- but usually one.

Anywho, he’s suggesting if I’m having any doubts about if I can quit (geninunely see alcohol in a different light and not need to ever want it) I should have one last drink before finishing the book. Then see how it works out, or re-read if necessary.

So the thing is, I do have doubt about an aspect of it. But I’m afraid if I do get a drink this weekend, it’ll be more like a relapse and 5 days will basically be my highscore. Should I not risk getting back into the habit, or risk following his advice wrong and suffering when I do finally crave a drink again? Very difficult position here.

(Also- As much as I say it’s been working to change my POV on alcohol, I’m kind of excited of the idea of having a drink again. Which is what worries me)",17

An old beer buddy of mine and I were gonna go for a walk earlier but we missed each other’s messages. I am now home chilling on my couch, playing some music on my guitar, with takeaway food on the way. The buddy just called me from a bar (he might have been drunk) and his girlfriend and he invited me (it’s just 5 minutes away) and tried to guilt me into joining and called me lame for being in on a Friday night hanging out at home. It really upset me and played into my insecurities around missing out on partying/the Friday social scene (I freak out that everyone is out every weekend having wild nights clubbing and getting laid - even though I know most are probably just having a few beers at a bar). Anyway, I have done a lot of work to tone down that feeling - and I feel like his call gave me a seriously unpleasant flashback to it, and now I feel really lame and pathetic for being in at home on Friday in my comfy pants.

This was in the midst of a drunken mental health episode at SO’s mom’s that I’ve sought help for, and I have a much better relationship with alcohol today. The problem is that I’ve been told that SO’s mom’s fiancé (now husband) is not comfortable with having me at their wedding today or Thanksgiving dinner later this month. I understand that there is lingering discomfort with having me around, I get it. It’s just still painful to have constant reminders that I fucked up so horribly that I essentially don’t exist to that side of my SO’s family now.

As an educator, I am all about equipping my students with everything that they need to be successful in my classes. I have a Course Resource section in all my class shells with links, documents, and the like. For winter semester, I’m planning on renaming this section “The Toolbox” to hammer home that point (giggle). 

I’d like to ask all of you to chime in and post what you have in your own personal toolbox to help with your sobriety. 

What has worked for you? 

What did you try that DIDN’T work? 

For me, staying busy and keeping my mind occupied was key. Having my library card accessible and a stack of books to pore over was a great help. Having the physical books there is key, as it gave my hands something to do instead of holding a beer. 

I also downloaded the Headspace app (https://www.headspace.com/) and have been using it on a somewhat regular basis. For those pundits that say that they don’t have time to meditate, YES, you do have time. The app offers a variety of lengths to dive into from 10 minutes to 30 and beyond. 

I have also discovered Yogi Teas (https://yogiproducts.com/) and I love their taste and calming effect on my mind/body. While I used to relax in front of the fire with a glass of wine and a book, I now brew some tea in my cute as a bug Chantal teapot/mug combo and relax alcohol free. 

So, what’s in your toolbox?

I've now been sober since September 5th, but I have had a drink 3 times since then. Just not enough to be drunk and it didn't lead to a binge. The 3 times were prosecco at a wedding reception, a few beers at a University Reunion and drinks with a meal at another wedding. So they were all one-off things, I haven't been to the gas station for beers or anything like that.

But each time I felt like I had to reset my counter, for me, because I felt if I didn't then I would start to come up with other ""one off"" occasions as an excuse to drink and then probably end up at it every weekend and then be slowly back to square 1.

After a considerable amount of time and perspective, you can see how alcohol does the opposite of what you want it to do. Make you feel better, have more fun, create more exciting memories, make you more desirable, etc.

I thought it would always feel like a punishment or that I’m being left out. Like it’s not fair that I can’t drink alcohol. I didn’t believe I’d get to where Annie Grace describes. I truly don’t want it in my body or in my life anymore. 

I know how desperately I wanted to read, listen, watch everybody’s story to give me comfort and hope.

After lots of lurking and *wanting* to ""not drink with ya'll that day"" I've finally managed to make it through not 1 but 5 consecutive days of no booze. 1 week ago I really didn't believe I was capable of this! I recognize this is my achievment but I absolutely would not have had the motivation/inspiration if it wasn't for the stories shared on this community. 


Thankfully I didn't experience too many withdrawal symptoms as I wasn't downing a bottle a day or anything like that. But I was averaging about 35+ drinks a week and only increasing my consumption associated self-destructive behavior (eating garbage, gambling, etc).


To be honest the thought of *never drinking again in my life* is terrifying and kinda unbearable so I'm putting the blinders on and just taking it one day at a time.


Wish me luck as this will be my first weekend sober.",19

I had sucessfully quashed that same voice around day 55, with the advice of my friend to atleast make it to 60 days, a nice milestone number.

Anyway, it felt terrible have that 1 drink!  I was anxious at being caught, and kind of upset with myself for not making 100 days without a single drop of alcohol... I like to set records...  Didn't like that I caved in.  But because the experience was so bad, I have no problems continuing to be sober every day.  I'm really enjoying the loss of anxiety  and better health.

This time even packing was easier (I usually start freaking out the day before flying).  Woke up before the alarm.  Got through security no problem.  Now I’m sitting at the Charlotte airport just chillin’.  No temptation to pay ridiculous amounts for a glass or two of wine.

What a difference six months makes.  Another unexpected benefit of sobriety!

2021-11-05 13:11:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qnfrxl/the_hospital_was_really_vague_with_my_results_and/,The hospital was really vague with my results and it's driving me crazy.,"I went into hospital last week with slight eye jaundice, some leg swelling and abdominal pain. I got the bloods taken, the IV's, the CT scan, the Ultra sound and an X-RAY. I was there for roughly 10-12 days.

I am upset because I feel no one would give me a straight answer and it really felt like it was on purpose. I've left the hospital more confused about how bad things are then ever.

First I was told 'Alcoholic liver disease', then 'mild scaring', then 'severe scarring', 'cirrohsis', 'just some swelling'. Every doctor or nurse was telling me a different level of severity.

I never plan to drink again. The threat of dying in my early twenties is a great dissuader, I've been sober since the day I entered the hospital and kept it going now I'm discharged, which is the longest I've managed in years.

I just feel infantilised, like the doctors and nurses were treating me like a child and I am so frustrated. I've been given a strict liver disease diet plan but the doctors told me I could still eat some salt because I don't have stomach swelling, just leg swelling that comes and goes, which just seems counter intuitive? I've been avoiding salt anyway.

Several times I asked how bad the scaring was (I had seen online that there is a scale system that can be used to find out how bad the damage is) but they refused to tell me, saying ""it didn't matter if it was mild or severe, it was permanent and the solution was the same, stop drinking"". Well when one persons telling me I have scarring and another is saying it's just swelling I think at that point TELL ME? Because one of those is far more permanent. I feel like I am going crazy.

Maybe I do deserve to be treated like a child because this frustrated me just like a kid, it feels like 'keep away', it feels like my own medical information and the state of my body are being hidden from me. If it's mild that'd be a nice comfort, I would stay working my minimum wage job and still remain drink free. If it's severe I have some serious calls to make to friends and family, and would probably look into bucket listing some things to do in my life.

They wouldn't tell me how it would affect my life expectancy (which, is for once the more understandable thing as it really depends on factors, like genetics/age/diet, but a ball park figure would be nice).

Finally and most annoyingly to me is they refused to tell me the normal range for things in my liver tests results (Bilirubin, for example). I really would like to know how deranged me results were.

Frustratingly I got my discharge papers which say all my scores, bilirubin, ASP, ALP, and what my PT ratio is. But even after hours of googling I can't find normal ranges for these things. I just want to know how out of wack things are.

For example everywhere I google online it says bilirubin normal levels are 0.2 – 1.2 mg/dL. But my result just says a whole two digit number with no decimal point or form of measurement?

Did anyone else experience this sort of thing? It's making me constantly pace with worry, the not knowing is so so much worse.",10

Grateful 😌,"So I posted when I got my first year, but I was depressed then and when I read it back now it just hurts. Now I think I've earned the right, by getting to 400 days of sobriety, of replacing that post with this one!

Now and then I remember I am 'achieving' something by living alcohol and drug free. Probably not a huge thing to most people. Many people I know live with alcohol and live fine. It's a big deal to me, I try not to gloat about it and just keep it within ya know. I save the gloating for posts like this 😂

Because of how passive staying sober is, for me anyway, I regularly forget I'm even doing it, so when I remember it is always like a little bonus. A little quaint, happy feeling from the blue. It's weird that this is even a thing of note, the fact that I actually forgot about alcohol for an entire day. Sometimes multiple in a row. That's only kind of impressive or surprising to me because it's everywhere. 

For other drugs, forgetting of their existence isn't as difficult, over the course of the week anyway. Obviously, this completely comes down to someone's lifestyle and their relationship, proximity and history with the drug etc. but with alcohol, it's much harder to stay away from.

If someone wants to avoid heroin for example, they can attempt or consider shaping their lives so that they aren't going to have access to it. With any drug, inclduing alcohol, you do this. People with genuine addictions obviously have to work very hard to seperate their lives from the drug, and find the help and the right people they need to live an addiciton-free life. But for alcohol, it's sold on store shelves. It's embeded within almost every culture's history on planet earth. It gets to the point where you feel as though avoiding it is basically like avoiding bread. But, bread isn't chemically addictive.

Most of us who go teetotal still regulalry hear about alcohol from their family or friends. Imagine a world where this would be the case for amphetamines or acid? Like ""oh yeah, honey I know you're a year free now of meth, but I had some last night with a couple friends down at the local and had a great night! Again, I know you don't go in for that sort of thing anymore, meth that is. Not sure why, it's fine in moderation!""

I'm not trying to say avoiding other drugs is easy for people with those addicitons, if anything I sympathise because of my own past reliance. Just interesting to me is all. Avoiding something that, in my country anyway, is everywhere, consumed by all my friends and family, advertised and treated like some kind of fun juice, and not legal poison. 

ANYWAYS I probably will read back on this and just think 'Oh you innocent fool' like I always do when I look back 😆 it's just some thoughts on the subject tis all. I really am proud of myself and happy I'm doing this. I probably would be living a darker life right now had I not given it up. I am grateful!

* Best sleep in years
* More energy
* Started meditating
* Started exercising
* Better diet 
* Lost 10 pounds
* Better skin
* Improved at work
* Less anxiety
* More patience
* Was a better partner
* Saved money
* Read every night
* Enjoyed food more

I started ""moderating"" in October. Ended up on vacation with my partner in mid-October and did the ""just a couple, I can control this"" and ""I'll stop drinking again when I get back from vacation.""

Well guess what.. I haven't stopped. Shocker. I've told myself everyday is the new day 1. I've failed on those promises to myself. That list above was pretty wonderful, right? Here's the list for the last few weeks:

* Terrible... terrible sleep. Wake up at 3am almost every night sweaty/sticky/anxious.
* Anxiety is much worse
* Stopped exercising
* Gaining weight again, feel bloated
* No more meditation
* Less patience with my partner (she is amazing and doesn't deserve any of it)
* Dry, dull skin
* Spend much more money (not just the drinking, but the unnecessary purchases that come along with it)
* Toilet time isn't quite as fun
* Stopped reading before bed

The truth is... there's nothing good that comes out of drinking. I want to be present. I want to stop letting life slip away. I want to be better for my partner and have the patience and the lessened anxiety necessary. I want to have a body and mind I'm proud of. I want this to be my last day 1.

This past week was better than the last. Once it is starting to settle in that I truly cannot drink again it is getting easier. Whenever I think for a second I could ""just have one"" I remind myself of the years I told myself I could drink in moderation. The nights I would go to the bar ""just for one"" and leave stumbling. I try to think of my face getting redder and redder and my voice getting louder and louder. Repeating myself over and over. Embarrassing myself in front of people I respect. All on nights I was ""just going to have one before I headed home."" I can't just have one. It's not in my DNA. 

My depression is improving. It's no wonder I felt depressed when I was pouring a depressant poison in my body 5 nights a week. My thoughts, however, are getting louder. That nasty voice in my head that says I'm a loser, no one likes me, the world wouldn't be impacted in any way if I wasn't in it. This voice is the same one that whispers to me that I could have a glass of wine at work and no one would know. That I would feel better. That I *deserve* it.  

That voice is a liar. I don't deserve to be hung over, sick, and depressed all the time. I don't deserve to be talking down to myself all the time. I don't deserve to be killing myself slowly with poison everyday. I deserve to be happy, healthy and sober. I deserve to have the energy to improve myself. I deserve to be able to talk to people without alcohol. I deserve to save money to travel. I deserve to take my dogs on long walks in the woods. I deserve to actually live my life, enjoy it, remember it, and not just exist. 

So a big Topo Chico with lime cheers to two weeks without alcohol. I love this for me, even when I don't. Thanks for being here with me, it means a lot. I will not drink with you today.",11

I spent the last week terrified I said something embarrassing and dumb (woke up to some DMs from two people I don't often talk to), so much so that I didn't go back and read the messages (too embarrassed) and let my imagination run wild on the very worst scenario. After reading them, it was literally nothing. A sorta nonsensical thing on one, and on the other someone had actually touched base with me about a common interest we used to talk about. 

Anyway, I guess the moral is sometimes you do shameful things blacked out. Sometimes you don't, but either way you're saddled with the same speculative guilt. Lose fucking Lose. I'm sorta laughing at this current situation, but damn walking around with that feeling fucking sucks and isn't funny.

*What you'll need:*

Red or white wine vinegar

Club soda or water

A glass.

I put about a shot glass or an ounce of the vinegar in a glass and add about 12 ounces of the ""mixer""

I like the taste and the vinegar gives the drink a sort of kick like alcohol usually would. It seems to scratch that itch that just bubbly water doesn't.

*Keep in mind: *

Vinegar is acidic and therefore not great for your teeth. Drink in moderation

Make sure that your wine vinegar doesn't contain alcohol! From what I've read the process of making vinegar removes the alcohol. But I'm a park ranger, not a vinegar master so I'm not about to claim that 100% of vinegar is alcohol free or at least only contains trace amounts of alcohol.


All that being said, I hope you try this out and it becomes a cheap and easy tool for you to add to your toolbox when you want to grab an alcoholic beverage. Things like this have helped me immensely",5
2021-11-05 11:41:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qndu7c/1_sober_solar_lap/,1 sober solar lap,"365 days ago I woke up feeling like the floor of a taxi cab. I had vomited and had no recollection (my husband told me), my heart was racing and I wanted to peel my skin off like a banana. My shame was deep and present. My body had begun to react quite differently to alcohol, even if it was just a ""few"" drinks. Later, through the help of this sub, I would learn I was experiencing kindling and my brain would never be the same. 

It has taken 4 years of trying to make 365 days. Previously, the longest I could make it was 6 months...6 months was my kryptonite. Each time I went back to alcohol, the way I felt the day after drinking was worse than the time before. Getting here has taken practice, I have to practice being a non-drinker. Even though I feel accomplished today, this journey is day by day. I can't let my guard down today, or tomorrow, or the next day. 

I wanted to share a few things about my experience getting here, for anyone who is interested:

- supplementation is the cornerstone of my success. B vitamins, DLPA, tyrosine, glutamine, magnesium, and herbs made a significant difference in helping with anxiety, depression, sleep, and cravings. It took some research, but it was well worth the time spent. 

- quit lit is a life saver and gave me the information I needed to consciously change my thinking about alcohol. It helped me not feel powerless but powerful in actively choosing what I wanted for myself everyday. 

- some days sucked, this is not easy, and occasionally the alcohol deamon would rear its ugly head. Day 300 to 320 were really hard. Luckily I have built a tool box to deal with cravings in the moment or lingering thoughts. If all else fails, I just take a benadryl and go to sleep.

-Sleep. What an amazing ally in recovery. My brain needed (and still needs) the time to heal from all the abuse it sustained. I have no shame in putting myself to bed early. Sometimes it feels a bit hokey to go to bed at 8:30pm, but if that's what I need, I do it. Plus, it's wonderful to wake up feeling and looking amazing while everyone else wakes up grumpy, bloated, and anxious. 

-This sub has been my support group. Tried AA a couple of times and it didn't work for me. I know I need support and I find it here. Reading about everyone's experiences has taught me a great deal, and I couldn't have made it this far without all of you. Thank you 💜 

-Having my brain and body back is even more amazing than I had anticipated. When I was in the thick of abusing alcohol, I couldn't fathom how good it would feel to not have poison in my system or to feel my body and brain working at peak (or at least greatly improved) capacity. My ability to comprehend things I read has returned and my memory has improved 10 fold. I didn't even know these things were gone while I was drinking! 

Thank you for reading this far. I'm off to have another  alcohol free day! 

366, I'm coming for ya.",63

I ended up blacking out. I have never done that before. I can usually have a few cocktails while I’m with them and everything is fine but this time I totally crossed my line and kept going.

I sent my fiancée a bunch of embarrassing texts telling her to come home from work now, and she did, and came home to find me obliterated and the kids (7 and 8) totally weirded out by the state I was in.

She kicked me out. She gave me the engagement ring back. We have been together for five years and we were supposed to be getting married in the spring. She’s been sober for three years.

At first it just sounded like she wanted me gone for the weekend. Now she said she’s going out of town Monday and Tuesday and said she wants me to get all my stuff while she’s out of town.

I am completely destroyed and heartbroken. Our relationship was doing great but admittedly my alcohol problem has been getting worse for years. I think I’m self medicating for anxiety. I’ve booked an appointment with a therapist.

It’s probably only a slim chance I’ll get her back, but I’m going to do everything I can. I know I need to do it for myself but right now I really don’t like myself so I’m doing it for her and for the kids.

I’ve got the next 3.5 months off from study mostly (just taking a couple summer courses) before I start my masters degree. I’m still struggling with my depression but since the pressure is off a bit now, I think I’ll actually be able to see friends again, pick up hobbies and rejoin society soon.

My only concern is that I still haven’t been subjected to the social pressure of drinking yet. I’m worried I won’t be able to sustain my sobriety for long, especially when I start going to parties and start dating again.

I remember many times being 100% paranoid if I saw a police cruiser because I knew I was drunk. Not just going to the bar either, like going to the grocery or running errands on a weekday. Many times I woke up the next morning and couldn’t remember how I had even got home. Stupid.

Especially for moms.,"Facts: I’m a recovering alcoholic. I’ve been sober since 8/1/21. I’m a small gal at 5’2” and was 115 lbs before I had my kids.

Drinking took a toll on every aspect of my life. Insecurity fueled my depression which in turn caused me to drink more. Drinking more caused me to gain more weight. Alcohol has been a struggle for a long time. My alcoholism was controlled from about 7/2016-9/2018, when I had my kids. Then it all changed once reality hit of being a SAHM. Something that is truly a gift turned into a mental burden. I dove right back into my pity hole.

Fast forward to 3/2021. I went to a 28 day program for SI/SH and alcohol abuse. I got on the right meds. I did some extremely deep diving into my traumas and childhood. I felt great. I was sober for 2 weeks. Right back in that ditch.

Desperation for anything positive and an intense need to feel some sort of control over my life made me put the bottle down. I hadn’t hit a story like rock bottom. I was just unwilling to continue the life I was living once I had that taste of hope.

I deserved more. My husband deserved more. My kids deserved more.

I see a therapist twice a week. I have a sponsor. There is no alcohol in my home. I’m honest when I’m uncomfortable in a situation related to alcohol. I’m dedicated to sobriety.

Now to the physical aspect… In the past I didn’t have much confidence mentally, but damn I loved my body. Pregnancy obviously changed my body. And my mental health declined that much further. In sobriety, it is challenging me to dig deep into other things that I love about myself. Like my creativity.

Now, I have MY body back. It’s not the same. I have stretch marks, sagging skin, scars. And I love it. All of it. It has sustained me this long. It’s taken my abuse and kept going. Now that I am treating it better it is improving, not just physically but mentally.

Sobriety is challenging. I have good and bad days. But sobriety has allowed me to reclaim my temple.

I went from 150lbs to 120lbs since I stopped drinking and started eating right. I’m more active. I wake up with a clear head. Go to sleep with a stable mind and body.

It’s incredible the things you can get with sobriety. You all got this. It’s time to reclaim your temple.",26

Let me start by saying that I did not have a good relationship with my mother.  I need to get this out, so I'm posting, but if you're expecting a post about her being my BFF, this isn't it.  I want to talk about how her death relates to my drinking.  I used to think that the timing was just a coincidence, but I'm not so sure anymore.

When she died, I went into shock.  The loss of the first parent (in my limited experience) is just shocking.  It's like the earth has shifted a little off its axis.  Things are just not right.  After the initial shock, things were just really quiet.  No one was yelling at me or criticizing me or stealing my identity.  It's like I spent my whole life getting pummelled by a firehose and one day, just like that, the firehose was gone.  The water shut off.  I could dry off.  I could walk away.  I was free.

I liked the quiet.  Or so I thought.  But to be honest, this was the time when I started drinking liquor. Daily. I was bored.  I was living in SF and I didn't know anyone so every day after work I went to the bar (as you do in SF) and just sat there soaking in beer and fernet until it was time for bed.  Unsurprisingly, I had my first blackouts then.  I started thinking about drinking when I wasn't drinking.  Spending money I didn't have on booze.  And lying, as alcoholics do, to myself and everyone else around me.  Lying about drinking, yes.  But also about dumb shit.  Anything, really.  Lies just popped out of my mouth before I could even think about what I was saying.  

I don't think I was ready to let go of the water.  I don't think I knew how to stand there in the peace and quiet.  I was unprepared.  My mom died fast, in her sleep, unexpectedly so there was no long goodbye or watching her deteriorate.  Also, We lived on opposite sides of the country and I had spoken with her but I hadn't seen her in about 3 years.

So I guess I turned the hose on myself.  I took up the mantle.  I wish I hadn't, but I did.  And now 15 years later, she's still gone and I am working to undo the damage - yes the damage she did all those years ago, but in a very real sometimes moment-by-moment way, the damage I did in her wake.

I have made peace with her.  I know she did her best.  I know she loved me.  And I know that if I'd had another mom I would have different people in my life.  And I really love the people in my life.  So I suppose I am grateful for her and all the shit she put me through.  And I pledge on her birthday to turn the fucking hose off and learn how to stand in the peace and quiet.  Happy birthday, mom.

I mentioned it to him and he appropriately celebrated for me. Each day up through 4 weeks, then 30 days, then the calendar month, I checked and tracked meticulously. Then the 5th week just cruised on by. It felt funny. 

I’m in a blurry zone now. I know in the past, I have completed 5 weeks for certain. I don’t recall how far I made it beyond that. At some point the last time I grew confident and decided to try to moderate again. 2.5 years blew by in what feels like an instant, and here I am trying again. 

It could have been 5 weeks and and a day. I feel decently sure it was never six. The fact that this particular milestone is nebulous to me feels familiar. 

It harkens back countless nights spent in the purgatory of a 3am wake up from a blackout. Curling into a ball and writhing around in bed. If I even made it up there and didn’t pass out on the couch, or go to the guest room because we had a fight. 

Desperate to sleep but unable to. Wondering how late I started to lose time. Taking inventory on my body. Was I still wearing my clothes or did I make it into pajamas? Did I put my jewelry away and wash my face?  How late did I stay up after my memory stops? What did I eat? Oh god, what might I have said? 

How many did I have?

I woke up with that same question in my mind today, but it was on a better subject. Now I’m wondering how many sober days did I have? Is this one the highest number yet? 

I will never know, so I guess I’ll celebrate this one. 

Today is the day that matters most, because it’s the one I plan not to drink with you fine people.  Happy Friday friends. IWNDWYT",47

Today I have a second date with a loving partner and for the entire week, I have been waiting for this moment, visualizing us drinking a bottle of expensive rosé and having a special dinner. We already had intimacy on the first date, and we have been talking several times throughout the week. He's quitting smoking and we are really saving ourselves to be in the best shape possible for today. I haven't drink or smoked and I did my workout routine.

Since I had the plan for the date I wanted to drink rosé from a special shop. It has been really hard not to ""do a preliminary taste"" throughout the week. On Tuesday I wanted to try a small bottle of rosé and Wednesday I wanted to drink an entire bottle from the same shop. Yesterday I just wanted to drink so even beer would have done it, but I resisted. I ate soup to fill up my stomach and watched a movie until it was bedtime.

I really want to have a romantic dinner and I have this idea of drinking wine in fancy glasses and wearing a beautiful dress. I just realized I never ever had (initiated) intimacy without drinking alcohol, which concerns me. What do you think? Should I take it easy and drink a bottle between us two today or should I offer a non-alcoholic option? Maybe non-alcoholic champagne?

I have not made my mind to completely stop drinking, but reading your posts and comments has helped me not to drink since the beginning of this month. I don't drink to get wasted but I drink so often that it started being a problem for me. I have mentioned I'm stopping drinking with my date when he told me about his cigarette addiction. I'm sure he would understand, but I am afraid of being much more restrained without alcohol and not being able to let go and fully enjoy my date. Have you been in a similar situation? Thanks a lot!",3

2021-11-05 04:53:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qn6un2/i_get_it_son/,"“I get it, son.”","During dinner a few weeks ago my 10 year old son randomly asked the quite pointed and unusually specific question, “What is your biggest adult regret?”

Instantaneously, I stared awkwardly down at my dinner as my wife answered first. 

My downward stare wasn’t just an effort to hide the welling tears away from my two young boys, but a frantic mental effort to decipher whether the remarkable specificity of my impending answer would make the scene seem overtly choreographed. 

My turn. 

“On November 3, 2017 at about 6PM, I wouldn’t have gotten my car keys and driven to the local bar and gotten a growler of my favorite beer.”

After a brief spell of silence, sensing the immense gravity of the statement and moment, my precocious son looked at me and smiled beautifully through these words.

“I get it, Dad,”

You see, that fateful Friday was Day 186 of my first real adult effort at quitting alcohol - and it was a moment and decision that delayed this very day by almost exactly 4 years. 

During my early morning walk on May 2nd of this year, I paused and sat on a bench and stared out across the vast and beautiful lake before me. With a dull headache and foul taste in my mouth from another night of regret, I was searching for help. 

On February 26, 2021, my beloved Mom passed away from a sudden and massive heart failure. In the months that followed, my nights had gotten later and my daily beer drinking habits a tad worse.  I was lost and covering up the pain the only way I knew how. Perhaps, most importantly, it’s worth noting that my Mom had a particular disdain for alcohol. 

Sitting idly on the bench, I decided to scroll through some old photos on my phone and came across a screen capture of a text chain between me and my Mom from 4 years ago. 

May 9, 2017 

Me:  “I’m 10 days in and feeling incredible!”

Mom:  “Best Mother’s Day present ever and you know I mean that. You will never regret putting your health and family first.  I love you!”

Ironically, Mother’s Day this past year was May 9th - only a week from that very moment. And so it was settled. I would quit drinking in her honor (and obviously for myself and family). I didn’t have a plan or a thought of “how long.”  Only that, on May 2, 2021, I wasn’t going to have a sip of alcohol and I was going to try and do the same thing the next day and the day after. I smiled out at the open water and finished my walk - determined to make my late Mom proud. 

So, perhaps, in retrospect with reference to my son’s initial question - my biggest adult regret is not doing this soon enough for my Mom to see me today.  However, in reality, my answer to my son is actually one in the same. 

Today, I’m 22 pounds lighter and unequivocally more present for my wife and children.  

And, yes, measurably happier in every possible way. 

So, whether through blind faith or the inimitable powers of irrational self-comfort, I believe she does see it.  She knows how hard I fought back to get to today. 

Day 187.  The longest I have gone without a drink since the naive and tender age of 16, some 26 years ago. 

And, my goodness, is she ever proud of her boy. 

This morning, I woke early as always and my first thought was that I knew I had made it. 187. I brewed a warm cup of coffee and slipped gently outside to look up to a star-filled sky on the impeccably clearest of cool mornings. I had intended to softly speak aloud but, instead, as if up from my toes to my eyes, came a spontaneous tearful burst of joy mixed with the authentic version of apologetic regret that comes in only the most intense moments of your life, if ever at all. 

Cutting through the stillness and silence of the poignant moment, in my own mind, I heard these reminiscently simple words through my Mom’s beautiful, heavenly smile. 

“I get it, son.”

Onward to Day 188…",492

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Twenty-four

Welcome to Friday sobernauts! Ah, I love Fridays; they are pretty jam-packed for me teaching-wise but I feel optimistically time-rich when I think about the weekend; I imagine it stretched endlessly before me and all the lovely things I can do to feed my soul; running around the forest playing with the pupper, painting or creating something new with that big block of clay I have, reading and dozing off to sleep, photographing all the late autumn mushrooms popping up at the moment…… but in order to really benefit from my weekend free time, I have to stay on track today. Because today is actually all I really have. 

I am here, present, living, breathing in the moment and I get to determine my attitude to these next 24 hours. I can see them as an opportunity, or I can see them as a drudge. I can look for the positive or I can dwell on my resentments. I can endlessly and disturbingly compare myself to others, or I can look for thé things that I appreciate in my life and that make me happy.

To paraphrase my buddy u/hairytubes, **I can choose to be a participant in my own life, or merely a spectator.**  So I’m diving in headfirst to this 24 hours. I can put another brick on the sober security wall I’m building, or I can smash it to smithereens. 

I will not drink with you today. How about you?",426

For everyone who is on day one or thinking about starting today or tomorrow, keep going. If you’re waiting for an ideal day or the perfect time to start, it’s never going to arrive. There will always be one more excuse to keep drinking in an alcoholic (especially one like me). You’ve just got to take the plunge and hold on for dear life. Find a community to support you because it’s too hard to do on your own (I use AA, there’s a wealth of people on here, I’m sure there are others).

I can’t quite believe two years sober is here. I’m so grateful for all of it. The journey, how much I’ve learned and the people who have helped me along the way. I’m now able to help others too. I chair my Wednesday AA meeting. I’ve done the 12 steps and I’m a regular at meetings. I’m surrounded by people in sobriety and I’m finally happy (most of the time). Learning to live life on life’s terms, slowly and one day at a time.

I’ve rekindled my relationship with my family, rebuilt my life with my partner and built bridges with the people I’d hurt in drink. In June of this year I qualified as a doctor and I started work in August of this year. I’ve achieved things I thought I had lost a long time ago in drink. Sobriety helped me bring those back. It took a long time, but it happened.

It’s always going to be about progress not perfection because none of us are perfect.

If you’re still on the fence about if you need to stop, if the drink is costing you more than just the money you give to the barman then it might be time to stop.

I love sobriety and I love this community. It’s like a little bit of recovery in your pocket, 24 hours a day. If anyone is struggling, please reach out for help. Message me if you have nobody else. Don’t try and fight on alone.

2021-11-05 02:48:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qn58v9/questioning_is_the_first_sign/,Questioning is the first sign?,"Hi all.. new to reddit.. so let me know if I'm making any faux paus..

TL;DR: I come from a family of addicts/alcoholics.  I'm wondering if it's possible to have a normal relationship with alcohol & recreational non-sobriety choices, or if I'm headed towards a life of addiction.

Does your family have a history?

My father warned me before I entered HS: ""If you put 100 kids in a room and let them drink all the booze & smoke all the weed they want, chances are 1 of them will grow up to become a hardcore drug addict or alcoholic; because of our family history, there is a 99% chance you will be that 1.""

While it's fair to question the actual statistics, this conversation certainly affected my choices as I grew up.  I didn't have my first drink until I was 19, my sophomore year of college, out of fear of jump starting the addiction my father warned me of.  & when I started, I had rules for myself: never drink alone, never drink when you're sad/mad, with every drink have a glass of water, make sure to eat dinner & be in bed at a reasonable time, etc.

Both of my siblings (younger & older) have over the years decided on a life of sobriety after certain situations.  So right now, since my parents & siblings are all ""Friends of Bill,"" I'm the only one still 'partaking.'  & since the pandemic started (& other stressful situations), I've begun breaking my rules.

I have so many questions..  My  fiancé comes from a family that doesn't believe in addiction (only weak vs strong people 🙄), but me...  I'm questioning if I'm capable of a 'normal' relationship with non-sobriety; I'm concerned because I previously told myself that questioning is the first step of recognizing that something is wrong.

I imagine these questions are common in this thread.. if it's better I refer to another's post & delete this, please let me know.

Thanks in advance.  I hope you all are doing well.. I know these are difficult times..",5

I'm still bitter, but I would be anyway even with booze. I'm glad I managed this sober.

One of my triggers has been my abusive family, and unfortunately being sober today I wasn't able to hold my tongue when she started berating me. She went nuclear and basically told me I am dead to her and she wants nothing to do with me ever again. The usual drama. She threatened to have me committed to a mental institution and/or call police. I'm 28. And this was over a minor argument. I'm moving out soon anyway, and have been planning to for some time. I only still lived with her because for years I was literally her carer, and she couldn't afford a place on her own till recently. But yeah, apparently I'm selfish, horrible and the worst thing that ever happened to her. All because I wasn't super excited to see my anti vax sister for christmas. She acted like I was barring them from visiting, I just said I wasn't going to be around much for it if I could help it and they could do what they want. My mother has done nothing but bitch relentlessly about my sister for the past year before this, so it's all very confusing. But she is mentally ill....

The other reason I wasn't stoked for this visit, was that my sister her boyfriend and my mother and up until now me would just spend them getting plastered, usually they binge on booze and they all smoke pot too and my family is who introduced me to it. (I don't think weed is evil, but they are basically hooked on it, do it daily and spend more money then they can afford...) So part of my fear of this visit was being put in that situation so soon. My mother basically mocked me for quitting pot the other day too, and literally called me a ""fucking pussy"" and said she liked me better the month before (which is when I was in the throes of an epic bender T\_T )

Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but I'm just proud of getting through this sober. This is the first time since I was a teenager I would be able to, and I've had to basically do it alone. All my friends live faraway, things are just opening up here after nearly 2 years of lockdowns on and off, and I've had to get sober in one of the most stressful times in my life. I'm going to my GP tomorrow to get a mental health plan arranged and will be able to get at least 10 sessions with a psychologist.

I'm also on day 2 of not smoking anything, quit a 10 year pot habit too, and that was hard over the last week. Usually I would have drank and smoked myself into pure oblivion and crawled into bed at this point.

Day 25 and IWNDWYT

Edit: managed to talk to her when she was calm, and things are a bit better now. Glad I didn't get wasted and continue arguing, being sober helped me address this in a better way. This is probably the first day i've honestly felt tempted at all, but I'm glad I didn't give in, and the urge went away fairly fast. Everytime I think about the withdrawals, and being afraid I was having a heart attack or stroke, I remind myself I never ever want to go back to that point again... ",9

I was looking through my diary, trying to find some notes about an event that occurred a year ago, when I was in the thick of things. I noticed that periods of clear writing were followed by periods of illegible writing, followed by periods of no writing. When I reflect on those periods, I realize I was shaking most of the time.

I’d meet people for breakfast and explain it away with “too much coffee”. I’d meet people for drinks in the evening and sneak to the bathroom\* to do shots so they wouldn’t see me shake. I learned how to avoid utensils, glassware, writing implements, or anything else requiring hand dexterity or fine motor skills. When it was really bad, I became twitchy, easily frightened, and panicky. I jumped at car doors slamming outside. I went into full-on panic attacks when people so much as touched my shoulder. So I stopped being around people. That made drinking easier to do. And the dragon chased its tail almost all the way to hell.

The last time I went to the Emergency Room in November 2020, I couldn’t even walk. My legs were tremoring so hard. It took hours for the docs to stabilize me with strong drugs. I swore off alcohol so many times that night. About a month later, I relapsed. Hard. After yet more stupid antics, I stopped again, with medical assistance. 

I write this post as part of my “symptoms” series to remind myself how fucking miserable I was. I can’t go back. Ever.

1. Has anyone found it easier to keep going when you don't really mention it? I feel like saying 'oh I'm sober now' without someone explicitly asking gives me some unearned sense of security/pride and then boom I'm drinking again thinking I can moderate.
2. Stopping drinking stops the downward trajectory, it's up to ME to claw my way back to a healthy, fulfilling life. Going to therapy, connecting with others, picking back up passions -all things I couldn't be bothered to do 8 IPAs in on a weeknight. But stopping drinking gives you a fighting chance, and then you have to be the one take advantage of it. If you're several weeks in, with the pink cloud fading and frustrations of life setting back in (like where I am lol), you got this!
3. Holy shit - has anyone else noticed that personalized ads go off the rails towards alcohol when you stop drinking? Like this has to be beyond just 'oh you just start noticing it more'. I'm talking ads for every type of booze under the sun, on podcasts, news articles, whatever. It's fucking insidious and every time I get another it reminds me how predatory American advertising/alcohol culture is. Fuck that shit. Guess they really do make 90% of their money off 10% of drinkers.
4. I've been trying more to think about the addiction separately from drinking. For example, I quit smoking a much longer time ago, and I'm able to see now that it truly has no benefits. Sometimes, I'll go check out r/stopsmoking, removing the appeal of what I'm actively quitting (alcohol) and contextualizing addiction with something else. I've found this helps me see cravings for what they are - my brain chemistry be a spoilt little shit as I force it to recalibrate.
5. Without a doubt, this is the most supportive community I have found on reddit. No matter the post, the comments are nearly always understanding, supportive, uplifting, whatever, it's honestly incredible. I don't have any friends or family who understand what this has been like, but I check in here nearly everyday and I just wanted to say thanks.
6. I have no idea what I'm doing most days and best I can tell nobody else does either but at least now I remember it in the morning    ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go celebrate by downing a whole bag of brookside pomegranate chocolates and cuddle with my dog

If you're interested in my backstory,  you can check my post history, but for the most part, it's really nothing any different than a lot of us have been through.  There's really no need for me to go over it for purposes of this post.

But I could really use some kind words and community so I don't feel so hopelessly and helplessly alone at the moment.  See, I'm in the middle of trying to clean up the last bit of complete wreckage I created b/f I started making a concerted effort to stop drinking.  I went to work (WFH, so Zoom) completely wasted a couple weeks ago and completely screwed it up on an off-the-charts level, and today I'm trying to fix it.  It's not going well.  As I work on this project, I have to listen to the audio recording of that day, and it's so disgusting and horrible and it's leveling me.  I can only make it about 5 minutes b/f I have a full-blown anxiety attack and have to quit, walk away, smoke a cig or just anything to try and gather myself up enough to try and keep going.  It's not working out so well.  It has taken me all day and, not going to lie, went and got 2 low ABV beers to help stop the shakes and to try and mildly numb the mind enough to stomach this process.  It has literally taken me the entire day to get through only about 45 minutes of five hours of work that's due tomorrow.

The more I listen to this recording, the worse it gets, as I got drunker and drunker that day.  I can hear it in the tone of my voice and also in the comments I made that day.  I want to puke.  I want to run.  I want to not have to deal with this.  I want to stop shaking so bad that I can't even type.  I want to rewind my life and prevent that day from happening.

But none of that is reality.  The reality is I have to face the music and power forward and get to the other side of this nightmare by tomorrow.  (when I have to re-live it for a third time while editing the project, but at least I won't have to hear myself.)

I don't have anyone in my life I can lean on and talk to or invite over to just be in the house so I don't feel so alone and be an anchor I can look to so as not to feel like I'm going to fall overboard any minute.  There's something about having somebody just be in the house that makes things seem less daunting and nightmarish.  Live a figurative holding my hand as I walk through the gauntlet until I'm out the other side.

So I turn to you, internet strangers, to ask if you should have a moment or desire to send a word or two of encouragement, I sure could use it.

I hope you all are well and are either on the other side of this phase of getting well or on your way to getting there.",15

2021-11-04 18:59:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qmx4x1/what_ive_learned_in_two_weeks/,What I've learned in two weeks!,"Apologies if this reads like a journal entry. I wanted to share my personal reflections and observations at the two week mark - especially if any lurkers, who might feel like I used to, could get some encouragement out of it.

Physically, I already feel much better, although the sugar cravings still come and go. Some of the scarier symptoms I'd been experiencing were gone before day ten, and the nausea has exponentially faded into (almost) nothing too. I've had more energy than usual, and my workouts are consistent again. I'm burning more calories every session than I used to, and I'm a lot more satisfied with my daily output/productivity. Every night, I go to bed feeling *good*. My dreams are coming back slowly, and I feel well rested when I wake up. My body just feels...*cleaner*.

Mentally, it comes and goes. I had wild mood swings for a dozen days, I think. I doubt I'm out of the woods yet. More and more time passes in between, but it's been noticeable for sure. My resolve feels pretty good, though. I only jonesed for a drink on four (nonconsecutive) days, but I powered through each time and am beginning to enjoy the clarity that's moved back into my head. It's sort of like getting a new lens prescription - I had no idea how sharply I could see the world again. I'm reading some quit lit too, which is helping, and checking in here on the sub and reading daily posts even if I don't always comment. It's not always easy, but I'm optimistic and I want to keep going.

Socially, I've been very cautious/private about bringing it up. My coworkers think I'm doing a dry run, maybe a late Sober October that turned into No Drink November (they're all heavy drinkers). At least they don't press it when I decline having drinks after we're off. My friends mostly do not know at all yet. The one I've told meant to be supportive but he reacted somewhat awkwardly, so I think I'm gonna have to get used to that or just downplay it as much as possible. I haven't told my family, mostly because my parents would have no idea how to handle it. Their reactions would probably derail my mental fortitude, so I'm leaving that one alone. My partner, whom I live with, is VERY supportive on the other hand. He still drinks, but very rarely, and it's been great having him to bounce thoughts off of.

Overall, my biggest takeaway was learning that I am physically addicted to alcohol, when I previously had no idea. I thought I was just drinking at the same rate as most of my friend circle, and especially my coworkers. I *really* thought (or wanted to think) that I was ""just like everyone else,"" except maybe a little worse sometimes. I didn't understand that my hangovers didn't get worse because I'm in my thirties now - they got worse because I was slowly kindling myself into bigger and bigger withdrawals. Hangovers aren't supposed to last for 24 hours or more, with shakes and nausea that bad - I think those were withdrawals and I just didn't know it.

Sure enough, quitting this time gave me the worst withdrawals I've ever had, particularly around the day three mark. No seizures or anything like that, but I felt like I had the flu (I did not). I spent a couple of nights shivering by the fireplace, wondering how in the hell I'd done this to myself, or how nobody told me it could happen. From when I was a kid, I recall so many displays of smokers' lungs, so many lectures about STDs, so many don't-do-drugs-kids! speakers (none of whom focused on alcohol, they basically just warned you not to do it until you were of legal age, and then not to drink and drive).

Anyway, I hope this was useful for someone out there, even if you haven't made any decisions yet. Thanks for reading if you made it this far! It's been very helpful having this subreddit in my pocket. :) IWNDWYT!",11

I don’t quite know where it started but I know when it got worse, I came out of a long term relationship and felt the world passed me by, so when I went out it was the only thing I knew how to do to get through. Drinking solved loneliness and waking up highlighted loneliness. The problem is I really like a drink I’ve always liked getting a little bit pissed and it worked at uni, I probably isolated myself in the long run because I only had friends who did drinking, come to think of it the only thing I really do with friends is go drinking. This is fine except for the fact that over my life I can’t stop when I should and it doesn’t take a lot for me to change mood, be aggressive, rude, unkind, etc. I have even had a couple of close calls with drinking nearly impacting work, leaving me worried for extended periods of time. Basically drinking is something which is killing a lot of my relationships and I can’t make new friends because when I drink I’m an incoherent dick. 

I do also really like beer, like micro pubs are the one, beer is a beautiful concoction. I know they do non alcoholic beer, but they’re not the same. If I could just have one or two then leave, but I have to have more, I can’t moderate. 

I have stopped for 3 months before and I do dry January every year, I don’t have many close friends and the people I do hang out with meet at the pub. My family say don’t drink, but when I stop they encourage me to have one or two when we’re out etc.


Td;dr: I think I’d be happier if I gave up drinking all together, but without the pub as refuge I think I will also be more isolated.",10

I really had an itch to drink today, so I started walking to the liquor store with my last 20 dollars (I'm a college student) to pickup a bottle. I'm really not sure why, but I turned around when I was about 3/4 of the way there.

I'm not sure if it was divine intervention or stubbornness or a combination of both, but I'm glad I ended up turning around to make just make dinner and focus on a hobby. 

I think the biggest reason that I turned around is that I'm just so sick of that lifestyle: saying and texting things I regret, not remembering entire days and nights, never having any money cause I spend it all drinking, etc. Thanks for listening.

I had that moment this weekend—I went to a party where I saw my friends, they were drinking, and I realized: I will never drink and laugh with these people until we pass out ever again. I love them to death, and they’re not the air-quote “friends” people refer to in recovery. They are my true, bosom-buddy, thick-and-thin, group-text friends. And we used to all drink together.

I could go on about the negative parts of drinking: the shame, the hangovers, the lack of motivation, the lost time, the injuries, etc. —I actually will go on reminding myself about those things, because it’s important to do that.

Not looking for any particular advice here. Just dipping my toes in to get started, and get motivated.

I’m a middle aged guy (about to hit 50) with lifelong insomnia and (diagnosed) anxiety. I drink to quiet my brain in my long evenings alone, and to fall asleep.

I know better. I know the alcohol just makes the daily anxiety worse, and that it does not promote good sleep and can actually worsen insomnia. I have the best of intentions every day, but by 3 o’clock or 5 o’clock or 7 o’clock the sheer anxiety of thinking about going to bed sober and lying awake with my thoughts means that I'll go pick up a 12 pack or a couple of bottles of wine.

I drink a lot - I finish both bottles of wine or the whole case of beer. Every single day. But only in the evening. I’m not a nip-during-the-day guy.

I swear I don’t crave booze. I don’t even really LIKE booze - a mild buzz can be nice but I don’t like feeling very drunk (not that I ever really feel it much any more).  Many days I really feel that I don’t want any. But the nagging worry about trying to sleep sober pushes me to it anyway. (How I wish I could stand weed and switch to that - but unfortunately I hate it.)

On the rare day that I don’t drink, I’M FINE! I don’t suffer withdrawal, I don’t freak out. I feel good! All kinds of herbal teas and gummies help a lot with the sleep. I feel better the next day, obviously. I become even more productive and less anxious. I’ve got it under control!

Oops, no I don’t. I forget all that and I drink again, despite knowing better.

I’m high functioning, very productive, and pretty successful (to outside eyes anyway). I was in pretty good shape and very active despite the booze until a couple years ago.  Then I downloaded the food delivery apps and added binge eating to my binge drinking. Then I let COVID be my excuse to double down on it. I’m getting fatter and fatter by the day. My back hurts. I’m starting to waddle to compensate for my oversized thighs and the back pain - when I was doing 50 and 100 km solo backpacking trips in the mountains just three years go.

And the money. Oh my god the money. By the time I add up the booze (expensive in Canada) and crazy food delivery charges, it’s like a mild to moderate coke habit. My finances are getting out of control. How can someone let themselves go deep in debt for 1000s in booze and food delivery a month?? Sheer insanity.

I need to stop. I need to stop. I need to stop. But there’s a bit of wine left and some beer in the fridge, so I know tonight’s probably not going to be the night. But it has to be sooner than later. I have to stop this “oh, I’ll have one last blast” thing.

How many “last blasts” have I had now??

If I cave this evening, it will be the last of the last blasts and I’ll be good tomorrow, right? Right?",14

I have been trying and failing at moderation for literal years. Every time I take a ""break"" I obsessively count the days until I can drink again. Then I usually fall short, and when I drink again I go right back at it. I am scared that I will obsessively think about it. But that's ridiculous. I'm obsessively thinking about it right now!

I always think of myself as a courageous person. But I'm literally terrified to quit drinking. Terrified to admit that I need to quit. Scared of trying and failing and disappointing my family. As if they haven't witnessed me going through that every day for the past several years with moderation. Terrified that I will spend every day in FOMO and obsessively wanting to drink.

The little break I get every night with my bottle of wine (which is slowly but surely turning into 1.5) from all of this is like putting a shroud over myself.

When I was little I used to crawl head first into sleeping bags to get out of the world. I think that is what I am still doing now, wine is my sleeping bag. I just crawl into a sleeping bag every night when I could be enjoying my amazing family.

I just want to wake up and feel like a normal, semi-confident person who can have a couple glasses of wine now and then without going overboard. Without thinking about it constantly. But I don't think that's going to happen. And if I take a break that has an end point, I know I will be obsessively counting down the days, whether it's a month, 90 days, a year... And if I quit for good I will still obsessively count the days, but at some point I'll probably stop. And maybe in 2 years or 5 years I might start to feel like a normal person.

I know what I need to do, but I find every reason and excuse possible not to do it. I don't think I have ever been as scared of anything else in my life. (Maybe my Dad).",7

We all know how bad it actually feels. It feels like we're down on our knees, everyone is against you and you can't come up with anything that's good about basically anything. And ofcourse the withdrawel symptons, which make everything much harder.

One  idea that helped me which actually works very well for me: Think about something you did as a child, in the years from like 6 to 12. Think about what you did with others or alone, and try it. When it was soccer - get a ball and just strike it on a wall for some time. When it was cycling - get on your bycicle and just drive somewhere, like just go you don't need a destination or a goal just go and think ""i feel like driving this way now and now that way"".

For me it is drawing. I used to draw alot in my childhood. Like every single minute that i had free time, i just took a piece of paper and some pencils and drew something. For some reason i stopped and i have no idea why. I just stopped doing it. Now when i have breaks at my workplace or have some freetime or get my thoughts, i just grab a pen and draw something. Just drawing. I don't even know what i draw i just start doing it.

We can do this. IWNDWYT.",23

Well I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and have slowly come to realise how much my addictions are due to that - to the constantly needing to be doing something, always needing something in my hands, always chasing the next dopamine hit, always looking for something else to do. And that often ends up with me chugging beer (or whatever) like there’s no tomorrow. Well a couple weeks ago after a particularly unpleasant night of boozing, the next night when I got that itch to reach for a drink I opened an alcohol-free beer that’s been sitting in my fridge since the dawn of time - and it worked. Chugging booze-free beer all night fooled my insatiable brain into thinking it was getting what it wanted, and it’s worked every night I’ve gone for alcohol free beer instead of boozey drinks since! (about 75% of the time.) Friends, this feels like a miracle. I have drunk booze every night without fail for longer than I can remember till now.

Well, we did end up having a couple mixed drinks, but *typically* it would’ve been having two shooters before I got to his house, then like 5 more shots before the game and then mixed drinks at the game and THEN 2-4 more shots when we got home. Yikes. 

Overall it was a great time and I don’t regret it honestly. With that being said, I’m grateful a happy hour I was supposed to go to today got cancelled, so no temptation there. I might be kidding myself that moderation is possible for me, but every time I’ve tried to quit all together I relapse HARD and binge for days or weeks on end. So, for now, I’m just committing to not drinking alone. No more buying shooters before I see friends or family, no bottles at home, none of that. I’ve tried to commit to that in the past and always went back on my word, so if I can at least accomplish *that*, I feel like it’s a good step in the right direction. 

Anyways, last night was fun but I’ve actually really been enjoying sobriety this past week otherwise. Feels good to not feel like shit lol.

On Irish improvised talk show with host comedian Tommy Tiernan,"[Fantastic interview where Adam Clayton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIClSreTMI) is extremely open, honest and vulnerable. He starts leading into his alcoholism around the 13 minute mark, but the whole interview is great.

The format of this show is excellent. Tommy Tiernan could be regarded a legendary stand up comedian, he won the main prize at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1998 which is still the most prestigious stand up award in the UK. He is clearly very comfortable in front of a live audience.

This is an improvised talk show. Tommy does not know who is guest is. An assistant just announces ""Tommy tonight your first guest is..."" and Tommy just wings it. Sometimes he has absolutely no idea who the person is.

When he does get famous people, in general, they are going on the show because they want to, not because they are promoting something. Certainly Adam Clayton does not need to do this unless he wants to, he is not plugging a new U2 album.  Apparently interviews can go on for 2-3 hours and then they edit them down to around 20-23 minutes.

Tommy himself was sober for over 10 years but he has started drinking again and talks about this in his stand up, as he said himself ""I can't get those 10 years back"" :)

It is fascinating to watch the wheels turn in Tommy's head as he searches for questions in his mind in real time.  Being sober for 10 years he can clearly relate hugely to what Adam went through.  You can see Tommy sensitivity and emotional intelligence shine through.

It's a fascinating idea for a talk show and is well worth checking out. It's ""The Tommy Tiernan Show"" from RTE, the Irish state broadcaster.",12

About 5 years ago I already had a drinking problem. I've always known it even at that young of an age. I never drank before I was 18 but as soon as I legally could I began abusing my limits and drinking pretty heavily. I ended up getting into a relationship with someone who hates alcohol and stopped until around 22 then suddenly our relationship began getting really awful and I hated it so I would drink and lie about it.. I don't even know why I drank I just did it to feel something good. That's the issue, I drink because its fun and I enjoy feeling messed up.. Here I am now, throughout lockdown I drank at least a bottle of Jack Daniels every 2 days... It started getting pretty bad. 

It's been about a year now and I still have drinking issues. I don't drink whiskey anymore but I drink at least 4 or 5 beers nearly every night. Od say on average throughout the week (7 days) I drink about 25 beers to average it out. Obviously switching from whiskey to beer has probably helped me not do too much damage but I still having issues quitting. 
I don't drink in the mornings it's mainly this voice in my head that craves it any time after 6pm. 

I used to weigh around 145lbs which was super skinny roughly 64kgs or something... now I weigh 179lbs or roughly about 77kg.. 
Obviously I've got to kick my habit or take control of when to stop..

After taking myself to hospital the other day I saw many people worse off due to their constant struggle with substance abuse and there were many. It was hard to justify myself being there when these poor lost souls are still succumbing to their drug of choice. 

People in drunken rages fighting with police the drunken and disorderly that have been a victim to an attack or the cause. How far would I have gone if I didn't stop drinking? Would I have ended up like them or worse.

I'm not perfect and alcohol has been a big contributor to that but it's not an excuse for what I have done to the people that have cared for me and still do or the people that have left due to the incredible selfish nature. 

I know sorry doesn't always cut it as it loses it potency after you say it once. I now know that the best way to sorry is to better yourself so that if you do meet someone else or that person again that the experience that you put them through and yourself never gets repeated that I feel can only be the way to truly mean sorry not with words but with actions.

I never meant to hurt you. 

Today I have a heavy heart my Nana has passed away but I can take some comfort in knowing she is with her husband once more and playing with her great grandson she never got to meet. She is a great woman cared for many people as a home carer, sheltered children with disabilities, took care of her family when her husband was tragically killed. I love you nana.

Please be kind to everyone you meet say sorry or forgive. Love yourself and stop drinking. Our time is limited so love not hate.

He also gets into angry moments when he yells at me and calls me a drunk and how I ruined everything even though I’m working so hard toward my sobriety and even explained how hard it was to be vulnerable enough to come out with it. He’s always had anger issues which I think is a trigger for me at times but I also want us to work. I’m at such a crossroads right now and don’t know how to feel. I almost feel like flat soda if that analogy makes sense. He will randomly start arguments with me or say things like my ‘stupid podcasts’ etc. I just don’t know what to do. I know anger is part of the process and maybe he is just grieving that part of him that thought I was flawless or in his words he once told me perfectly imperfect. I just need some strength here I guess. I’m heartbroken that my person isn’t embracing me and really what I really want is just love and support right now. I even suggested groups to him to help work through this. I’m doing a ton of work and don’t know if he ever will. Advice please. I don’t want a full on relapse as I get to my days off this weekend and all I have is time on my hands. Thank you.,12

I just wanna write this feeling out and see if anyone else has thoughts on it.

When I was active, I had friends. A bunch of fellow degenerates I'd drink with, talk shit with, be generally miserable with. It was a good gang, we stuck together and protected each other and supported one another though sympathetic laughing at our embarassing or disgusting stories. It was nice, it was a community to not feel so cripplingly lonely. They understood me, I understood them. We had each other.

I went sober without really telling anyone, sent the chat something about me getting on the wagon by force and peaced out, and nobody ever came looking for me. It wasn't that kind of group. They just kept on going, and I get that. I did get a lot of well-wishes and back pats, along with ""hit me up when you're back in the bottle"" messages that made me smile. That was a little over two years ago, and I have my 636 days now. I never really returned.

This whole thought process was brought to my mind a couple of months ago, when I sent that old chat a message thanking them for being there when I was in the middle of my addiction, how much they had meant to me and so on. It was a stupid idea -- To quote myself from that time:

> I understand why (at least) one of them got pissed off, I really do, because it's stupidly simple. Don't tell someone who isn't ready that you got sober and feel better. My sponsor had warned me, but... Idk. I figured hey, these are my friends, or at least used to be. We used to be a gang, you know? We had a community. I've shared some horrible, gross and horribly gross things with these people and never got anything worse than recognising laughter back.
> 
> Surprise, surprise. I got very passive aggressively told off, for (paraphrasing) insulting everyone and being selfish and full of myself. That if I want to be sober, I can still hang out if I fucking must, but to shut up about it. I've done that before, just hung in the chat to send memes back and forth or whatever, just hang out. But I guess this was too much. I think he felt like I came in to gloat. Which wasn't my intention, and I made sure to show my message to multiple people before sending it to make sure it was good. But I mean... I get it.
> 
> It was just weird, because I've never met that myself. Which is stupid! I don't know how many times I've seen active drinkers express the sentiment that all sober folks are holier-than-thou assholes who get drunk on the fumes from their own shit and sit around patting each others backs on cult sobriety meetings. I've heard it so much. But just like someone out of a Lifetime film, I just didn't think they'd think that about me.

To add to that, now, I can readily admit I've joined in on a lot of bile-spewing hate fests on sober people in the past. I'm no different to them, I was just naive enough to think they'd still consider me one of them after I got sober.

Anyway. I never left the group, but I did stop posting in the group chat. A few days after I sent that, there was a big discussion on what big assholes sober people are, when they walk up to an alcoholic and start talking. The consensus was that the only reason anyone would ever do that was to stroke their own ego and saviour complex. Now, I don't mean to be self-centered, but I felt like at least the guy who had told me to fuck off might have had me personally in mind to some degree, among other people.

It hurt, but I realised there was nothing in this group for me anymore. I was where they are, I know what it's like. No matter how many times they say that *nobody who's ever gotten sober used to drink as much as we do,* and thus is full of shit, that's a lie. The reason I managed to get sober, I don't know, but I know for a fact it wasn't because I drank less than they did. Hell, I know for a fact I outdrank several of them. 

But when I look at it now, so much of their time is spent shittalking sober people, but that's not what gets to me; what gets to me is the sentiment that there's some kind of rivalry. Like sober folks and active folks are two opposite gangs, and the active one is just protecting themselves from the constant attacks the sober one makes against their turf and their safe spaces. As if they're under a neverending, discriminating assault from an evil foe.

Like I've said, I was there myself. There's no difference between me and them, because I was in that group for a very long time. We're the same. I think that means I also used to believe there was essentially a sober conspiracy against us. But it doesn't make any sense to me, now, anymore than a post about the covid vaccine containing an AI makes sense to me. It feels extremely foreign.

Is that just because I am now on the other side? Is it because I was earlier so thoroughly unable to accept the idea of someone pitying me that I had to turn it into them attacking me? Is it because I never wanted to accept that something was wrong with me, so I decided that anyone who was sober just hated people who werent? Why was it so important to paint sober folk as a bunch of holier-than-thou assholes who probably thought drinking three beers one night made you an alchy and had no experience of anything in life?

In one of my first NA meetings, a girl there said ""when I first got here, I was convinced NA was just a collection of washed-up old junkies who sat in a circle and talked about God all day. And I gotta say, it's true, and I'm extremely happy about that."" Which I always liked. Yeah, I'm a washed-up alcoholic who got sick of the lifestyle, the addiction, the filth and the grime and the neverending despair. I got lucky, and managed to get out. That's all. There's no resentment in it for me, just humble gratitude. 

This got extremely long, and is probably best labeled as a rant post.

TL;DR: My old drinking buddies hate sober people, to the degree of almost making it seem like they believe there's some sober conspiracy against active alcoholics. I'm trying to understand it, mainly because I don't understand myself during the years I was a part of it too.",4
2021-11-04 07:26:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qmih3a/your_organs_will_heal/,Your organs will heal,"Hello there, just had good news out of an abdominal ulstrasound scan that I wanted to share as some of you may be afraid of the consequences that unreasonable alcohol use has on your organs.

Context : Male, 37 yr old, former barman, been drinking heavy stuff everyday since the age of 18. I will not list all my favourite beverages as it may end up in temptation for some of you but let's just say that sugar was always involved.

Story : 3 years ago I was not feeling very well on a psy level as well as on a physical level. After a few check ups I ended doing an ultrasound of my guts. Diagnosis was : hepatomegaly (big liver) and steatosis (fat liver). The doc at this time was very clear about the link between drinking alcohol and this. The next step was liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which is irreversible. I started to decrease slowly my alcohol consumption and stopped for good on the 1st of january 2020. A few relapses made me reset my badge but anyway I was (and still am) drinking way less than I used to. I could spend weeks without drinking anything but water. To be honest I was scared. Fear is a powerful source of motivation. The deal was to keep checking the evolution of my liver every 6 months in order to stay motivated and to identify cirrhosis at the earliest stage possible. 6 months ago my liver was still fat, but thing were getting better. This morning, the doc officially wrote on his report : ""No more steatosis"", and added : ""Congratulations, you healed your liver, your pancreas, gall bladder, kidneys...""

There's no reason to be afraid of bad thing happening in this area of my body anymore. It felt like a huge victory. What I would like you to keep in mind is that, yes it's hard, yes sometimes you wonder why you're doing this as you don't really see the positive effects of sobriety. But inside, silently, and fairly quickly, you heal, you clean and repair your organs, from your brain to your toes. Gift yourself with healthier organs, free yourself from fear. You can heal.

TL;DR : I stopped drinking (to be honest reduced by 98% my alohol consumption) and had a medical confirmation this morning that I got rid of my severe liver steatosis. Want to share this so you can realize that you can heal too.",60

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

Hey everyone, hope your weeks are going well. Work has been crazy these days and so I’ve been seriously hanging on for the weekend. 

Yesterday I decided to head into my local town and take advantage of a co-working space (think of like a budget WeWork style thing). I’ve been working remotely for over 18 months and had been feeling a bit cabin-feverish and stuck in, so I decided to try something new and check out this place. 

It actually felt great to get up early, wear some decent clothes, pick up a coffee and have a productive day in a new environment. I even left work a couple of hours earlier and walked around the town...I’m relatively new to the area, so it was fun to wander around without any urgency. I then went home and got into my pyjamas at 5pm. 

I’m so grateful to have the strength to recognise when I need to try something new or make a change when I’m feeling a bit stuck. Working from home can be a bit lonely and so it felt healthy to get out. I’m also thankful I recognised my needs and took time to rest during what has been a really hectic period for me, lately. Before I quit drinking I never recognised signs of burnout, because I was always running on empty or worse. 

How are you all doing? What are you feeling thankful for today?

Take care!

Then I've bought non-alcoholic 0,0% beers since to help me along the way.

A six-pack a day while I enjoy my movies and series.

It's expensive.

It's about 8 dollars for a six-pack of the 0,0% ones.

I just looked at the shelves at the store and they apparently have 0,5% beers for 4 dollars per six-pack.

I mean, they write ""non-alcoholic"" on them so if I even got the slightest buzz I guess I'd be able to sue the hell out of them, right?

I would still feel like I'm betraying myself if I bought them...

I asked about this in /dryalcoholics and someone said I should try seltzer water.

Maybe it'll trick my brain.

Seriously yesterday I was getting ready to buy some 0,0%'s and then I sat and thought about how expensive it was and how it's kinda not good in a way... sat there for 10 minutes before leaving to get them anyway....

Just like when I was drinking, thinking to myself that I shouldn't drink but doing it anyways for months on end... actually years on end...

So, does seltzer water help trick your brain? Is it not good to trick your brain? What do you think?",1

So what's the point? In my experience, drinking to enhance special occasions has just detracted from them. I spend all my time focusing on the drinking and none focusing on the occasion.

It was a nice thought progression. When I've thought of not drinking in the past it's been very shame-based, like I wish I could drink but I shouldn't because I'll get drunk and be foolish and no one will like me type of thing. Lately when I've been thinking of drinking I've been thinking about how it doesn't benefit me. It feels like a relief not to drink, actually. Like oh, I *don't* have to physically run myself down and feel unwell/unproductive for days? I *don't* have to intoxicate myself to a point that I feel embarrassed by how I've represented myself? Like that's not an *actual* requirement for functioning  socially in this society? Wow, what a relief.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Being a Friend

Good morning sobernauts! It was encouraging to read of all the riches in gratitude here in this sub yesterday - a cool abundance of thanks for so many lovely things. I’d like to ask a very different type of question today though, and I strongly hope you’ll give it a try. 

So I’m pretty sure I’m not alone on this sub in my world class ability to make myself feel like a piece of utter shit. After all, I know all my worst character flaws, my weaknesses, the things I’ve done that I’m ashamed of, the parts of my body that make me curl my lip, the personality quirks that irritate others, the qualities I’m lacking and am trying to work on. 

I grew up learning at the feet of a mistress of manipulation and humiliation, so my capacity for verbal self flagellation is uncannily good. I spent years denigrating myself and who I was, aloud in conversation with others, as well as when physically alone, and also constantly  in my head. I would talk to myself in the most horrible manner, like I was a total piece of crap. I would talk about myself in a self deprecating “jokey” way that served as the thinnest of veneers covering awfully low self esteem. I’d call myself stupid, useless, a fucking mad cow, awful insults I would never dream of saying to anyone else. I’ve always done this. I just didn’t realise how fundamentally dreadful it was until I got sober. 

Alcohol could always be relied upon to bring out first the falsely confident me, then a little melancholia, then doubt and fear, finally terminating (the next day) in berating myself for all my failings until I was a wet mess with a hot ball of self loathing.

 Oddly enough /s 🙄, this never helped me in my development as an individual. It took a very long time for the penny to drop, but eventually I realised that treating myself like one of my students - encouraging and applauding progress and positive aspects of self - was far more productive than flogging my failings to death. Yeah, I know. Shocker. In other news, water is wet 😂

Today, I’m going to do a very simple but effective practice given to me by a lady in the Secular Sober group I know. I’m going to treat myself with compassion and honesty, and give myself a morale boost to keep my sobriety on track. I invite you to do the same. 

I’m going to acknowledge three positive qualities or attributes that I like about myself. “Oh no Cinq! I don’t want to do that!”. Cue much squirming. Yes, it can feel uncomfortable. But it is a valuable tool for encouraging self worth and that I deserve to be sober. This isn’t bragging. This isn’t “being full of yourself”. This isn’t being “a big head”. It’s positive, healthy affirmation rooted in honesty. *I have no problem at all saying what I like/love about my friends.* So here is a step towards being a friend to myself.

I like my strong sense of curiosity. I like my kindness and am drawn to it in others. I like the way my brain works.

**What do you like about yourself?**

I will not drink with you today.",353

I love how stable and peaceful I am in sobriety. I love how I know how to actually take care of myself and relax without alcohol. I love building actual self esteem. I love never having to wake up with an anxiety ridden hangover ever again. 

But I still miss the 2 drink buzz and sense of adventure on a night out. I miss girls getting together for chats in wine bars. I miss the unpredictability and fearlessness of drunk me. I miss the ease of socializing and connecting with other adults. 

I’m not entertaining a relapse consciously. I know that these positive memories of drinking are skewed and when I think a little harder I’m reminded of the countless nights it went too far, 1 glass turns into 3, blackouts before bed, shame and fear when waking.

But there sure are benefits and incentives to drinking in our society and sometimes the weight of sobriety feels real heavy. 

I will not drink today and ride these emotions out. I will keep leaning into what’s good and read some old journals. X",50

I had stocked up on my non-alcoholic wine, I had enough food and a fidget toy.

Then my best friend drops the news that she bought a house. My first thought was ""well we must drink to celebrate"", with all thoughts of sobriety out the window I cracked a bottle of Rose and poured everyone a glass, including myself. ""I'll just have one"" I said to myself, knowing full well how many times I'd adhered to that in the past.

Well I had my first sip of alcohol in over a month....... and I hated it. 

The smell of the alcohol made me gag and I tipped the rest of the glass down the sink. I spent the rest of the party having a really enjoyable time, completely sober.

I think it’s a point that is hard to break through and I myself have fallen off the wagon in that time period many times. But after a real wake up call when trying to quit cold turkey by myself resulted in needing a feed days in the hospital to have my withdrawal medically supervised, I have hit 60 days. One of my biggest take aways from this experience has been that the way you look at each day can really help keep you motivated. Instead of focusing on the cravings you may be having, take a minute to think about every benefit you have right now from being sober. I bet you don’t miss feeling so hungover when you wake up that you need a drink to ease the feeling. And having a clear head throughout the day. Can’t complain about that. Feeling more energetic and more driven to actually complete tasks? Thank sobriety. That’s just my two cents. We all know you’re going through something that is so fucking unpleasant, because we’ve been through it ourselves. I just hope this helps even one person find the strength to keep themselves sober, that’s enough for me. And in case you don’t have anyone in your life who knows how difficult going through this process is, I want to tell you that you are doing something brave and challenging on so many levels, and you are a pretty amazing person! I wish you the best on your journey. I went from a self destructive drunk who made the smallest decision of following this subreddit, and now I’m 60 MOTHA FUCKING DAYS SOBER AND I FEEL GREAT!!!",16

I used to be incredibly active and now I literally get off work and go straight to my bed to play games or fool around on Reddit. I keep trying. The longest I went on my own was 8 days. (I was sick for a while and was hospitalized for 3 weeks so that was forced sobriety.) I know that ever single morning that I wake up from not drinking the previous night I feel normal, happy even.

It's not the number of sober days that I am proud of (40 days) it's the mental mess of a knot that I have finally untied. If you are currently struggling and constantly restarting, TRUST the process.  TRUST it.

For about 11 solid months I tried to stop drinking. What I truly wanted though was freedom. I knew I needed to eliminate the craving all together, I wasn't going to be able to get through this with willpower alone. I needed alcohol to be irrelevant in my life.

One day I woke up and the spell was finally broken.

So what was it for me that finally clicked? It wasn't a massive rock bottom, or an embarrassing night out, or even a terrible hangover.

It was a series of disappointments.

The alcohol (my beloved wine) always, always left me disappointed.

Wine, you were supposed to make me feel better during my heartbreak. Wine, you were supposed to make me forget my anxiety. Wine, you were supposed to make me feel energized and excited about life. Wine, you were supposed to be my friend when I needed one. Wine, you lied to me. I trusted you, I needed you but you always lied to me.

Finally I was sick of the lies and I could finally see through the facade. I was worried I would never break that bond. But it happened and it happened fast. Slowly and then all at once.

The best part is I don't think about you anymore wine. I don't romanticize the times we had together. Those were lies too.

(a tangent but something for me to note - I am recovering from a terrible heartbreak / trauma bond with a narcissist, and knowing that I broke that unshakable bond / addiction to alcohol, gives me so much resolve that I can get through this trauma too).

Thanks for reading and I wish you the best, you are strong and you can do hard things. Xx",25

2021-11-04 00:09:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qmch5z/day_1/,Day 1,"So this has to be my 10th day 1. Three years ago after we had our first son I quit drinking for 18 months. I felt great, lost a lot of weight, and had so much energy. After being sent to work from home, dealing with the stress of both my wife and I working a lot with now 2 boys home full time, I started having a beer or wine with dinner just to change my lens and transition from work mode to a relaxed state. I knew then that this would end up where I have found myself the last 12 months.

I don't drink around my kids, and would find myself really kicking off the night right after bedtime with a pull from the whiskey bottle and cracking a beer or hard seltzer, then repeating this 5 or 6 times. Many nights I'd end up drinking 5 beers and multiple pulls from a bottle. Even though I'd start at 7pm and blackout by 11 or so, I'd still be up early and logging in to work by 6 or 7am, able to work effectively but having a ton of anxiety and shame.

What scares me the most about that lifestyle is getting in to my 60s or 70s and realizing that I reduced the time I have on earth and miss out on being a grandparent all because I couldn't stop drinking. I also mourn the time I could've been more present for my wife and kids over the past year and a half. 

With all that said, I can't wait to hit and surpass my previous sober record of 18 months, reap the health benefits of sobriety, be more present and energetic with my boys, and wake up every day proud of myself. That is worth so much more than catching a buzz, feeling like a failure every morning, and just trying to pass the time until the kids go to bed so I can start drinking.

Im sharing this so maybe someone else gets a little boost on their journey. Reading through posts and your stories here over the past few months definitely helped give me the boost to make this change, again.

Take care all, and I hope you find success on your journey.",16

I thought that it would finally be the thing that got me to stop, if only just for the necessity of lack of sleep and needing to wake up early for work. It hasn't happened. No huge problems, but I still just need to drink every night. I get that itch. If we have alcohol in the house, I will finish it. So I have a system where I just have to make sure I never buy more than, say, six beers or whatever at once, so that way I can never get too drunk each night, but I always find a way to walk the dog and stop by the store, or go on a grocery run, or whatever.   


I don't know if I'm an alcoholic. I do know that I drink too much. I drink every night. I don't exercise as much as I used to, I gained about 30 pounds during the pandemic. It's had a negative impact on my work, but I've never been fired or called out at work for being hungover. I think I missed one meeting about two years ago because of drinking and being hungover, but it strangely feels manageable. I work in a field with other drinkers. My boss jokes about having a ""slightly severe alcohol problem.""   


I thought my wife being pregnant would be the thing that changed me. I kept saying I'd stop drinking with her out of solidarity. I kept finding reasons to wait one more month to abstain.   


I read Allen Carr's ""The Easy Way to Stop Drinking"" and liked it. Probably abstained for a month or so after that. I've never done AA, I don't think it's for me. I've told my wife I want to cut back, but I've never fully admitted I think it is as much as a problem as I think it is. She's in the other room soothing our fussy daughter to sleep as I write this.   


The latest thing I'm telling myself is ""having a newborn is hard. Be easy on yourself. You can drink for a few more months, just relax, just to unwind at the end of the day. Just as long as you stop drinking before she's old enough to really remember you having a problem.""  


I guess in a perfect world, I would like if I could drink socially. Like, just have one glass of wine with dinner on the weekend. But whenever I have one drink, I always want another. I'm good at stopping around six, is the funny thing. Haven't blacked out in years and years. Rarely do the hard stuff. Mainly just beer and wine (But if there is hard stuff in the house, I'll drink it, but I'm good about not letting myself buy the hard stuff).   


I don't want to admit to my wife that I think I have a real problem. When her mom came to visit our new daughter, I was drinking a wine spritzer (I fill a glass half with wine then fill the rest with seltzer, to make sure I'm at least drinking some water while I drink). Her mom made a comment like, ""Is that a wine spritzer? Aunt Bonnie used to drink wine spritzers. She was an alcoholic."" And that just kinda hung in the air for a moment. We didn't talk about it or address it ever.   


My wife is so supportive. I know she'd support me if I did tell her I had a real problem. It just feels like something you can't put back in the bag once you let it out. I keep hoping I can get in under control without like ""Confessing"" to her or to any family or friends. Even as I'm writing this, I still think I can get it under control on my own. Even when I talk to doctors, I lie about how much I drink. I haven't ever gone to therapy, but I think that might help. I'm thinking that I could tell my wife I have some anxiety about getting fired soon from work (I've been told that they're not renewing my contract after December -- haha, not because of my drinking, but because we relocated during the pandemic and I've been able to work remotely so far but they just said no more remote employees and we don't want to move back). So not fired, I guess, but not getting renewed. I don't have another job lined up. Anyway, I have a lot of anxiety about that, so I think maybe I could tell my wife I need to see a therapist for my anxiety, and then I could use that to also tackle the drinking.   


Thanks for being a place where I could write this. I hope you're all doing well on your journeys.",18

Posted about this a while back, but two years of hard work in therapy has me slowly coming to the realization that there has been a lot of emotional abuse in my marriage. Last week our marriage counselor told us straight up in exact words that we are in a domestically violent marriage. Hearing someone else say this made me realize I’m not just being overly sensitive, that this is a thing. Unfortunately my spouses response to this was “she’s abusive too” and “I can’t be with someone who thinks I’m abusive”. Not sure what to do with the latter, and more and more certain I can’t be mentally healthy in this environment if the abuse continues. 

I’m working on myself. It was hard hearing him say he’d felt I had been abusive ans am sure it was from times I was drunk, usually blackout drunk. But part of my journey is learning to forgive myself and changing how I cope with stress and conflict. I am doing the work. I also realized that one person behaving abusively doesn’t justify the other one doing it too. I still didn’t (and don’t) deserve to be treated abusively.

This past weekend my spouse went out and partied hard (I didn’t want to be around his friends who are heavy drinkers and drug users). The next morning he woke up and got into some sort of manic state, talking about how he was so depressed from our relationship that he is thinking about suicide. It scared me and I spent all day trying to comfort him, hiding his hunting guns and phoning my therapist to ask for advice. 

I’m fairly sure I need to leave but thinking about it is the most horrible emotional pain I’ve ever experienced. Yes the bad times are bad but the good times are good and I still love him. His suicidal ideation scared me a lot and paired with work and the other relationship problems I have been physically ill from stress. I haven’t been able to eat all week. 

 I’m sitting here, now, under the crushing weight of all this - and I am totally sober. Normally I’d turn to booze to comfort and numb myself. I am so proud that tonight i am making the choice to honor and love myself while going through what feels like hell. Many thanks to all of you who are on this journey too. There is so much wisdom in this group and it gives me hope that I will be able to get thru this.",19

I know quitting would be good for me, and I keep coming back here to reset my counter and try again, so that must mean I really do want to quit. 

I can't do moderation, and I know that once I start feeling good about my health and finances again, I will cave to the voice inside that says ""you've been doing pretty good, you deserve a night to binge and relax"". One night turns into two, then three. It's become an inevitable cycle that I can't find my way out of. My life has become a monotonous drone of drink, feel guilty and sick, hate myself and the fact that I'm doing the same shit over and over, feel better after a couple of days, repeat.

I had my performance review at work today. It was a glowing review. I even got a decent raise and was told I'm on the path to a promotion, but the areas I was told I need to work on are related to time off sick and instances where I was late. I'm sure you can guess the reason for those...

If I can just figure out how to keep the monkey off my back, I can live up to my potential and give myself the life I feel I want, instead of this miserable one I feel I deserve.  I see so many of you on this sub have found success and I'm so impressed and inspired by that.

It's weird feeling the wide spectrum of emotions, just to feel in general, really. I'd like to mention some of the major things that have been happening in my life as of tonight (November 3rd, 2021).

Me and my family are moving out of our home due to very sudden circumstances that have strained us both financially, as well as emotionally. Not only this, but my mother's alcohol use has worsened over the past few months and has resulted in her having a seizure a few weeks ago. Luckily, no damage was done physically to her brain according to a mandatory CT scan, and we haven't heard back from the neurologist about her MRI yet. Shortly after her MRI, she bought a box of wine and a bottle of Canadian Club. She had both in the house for a couple days \*at max.\*

Simply put, tensions have been high between the three of us (myself, father, and mother) and to say it's been stressful would be putting it lightly. That all being said, I don't think I would be handling it very well if I was still under the influence of alcohol. Do I handle this well sober? Yes and no. I still have coping mechanisms that may not be the healthiest, (mainly junk food) but I'm mostly able to make informed and rational decisions now.

I think now about how I'd be handling all of these current issues in my life if I was where I was three months ago. Rest assured, it wouldn't have been pretty. My worst days sober are better than my best days drunk.

About the only positive for last month was that I kept forcing myself to workout every day, bc it was all I had and I knew I was already close to the bottom.  And I mean ALL I had, no social/family support at all for 15+ years.  At least I know the bills are paid, that’s something.  Well I finished this naked mind yesterday and was finally able to outwit the demons and quit.  This is my tenth quit of 2021...  Here I am night 2, very happy I was sober today and not worried about failing tonight.  The best I’ve ever made it is six weeks but I have lofty ambitions to quit for the entire winter.  I’ll worry about making it thirty days first though.  I suppose my point is: don’t give up, and get exercise even when you’ve got nothing else it has a big psychological impact.  Also I really recommend TNM if you haven’t read it.

It's going to take time to unravel how much of the way I react to life is my anxiety/ADHD in its natural state and how much alcohol was making it worse, but I have no doubt alcohol was making it worse. If your brain already wants to react to things at approximately a 10/10 level most of the time, added anxiety through drinking is not exactly ideal.

I honestly can't remember the last time - at any job - I didn't come home either hating my entire life because work felt so bad or in love with everything because it went so well. (Probably the two years I was sober previously, if I had to bet money on it.) That's, uh, probably a really exhausting way to go through life.",6

I love drinking.  I love being drunk. I think day drinking is the best thing ever.  There is no alcohol I will not drink.
 Covid has totally turned me into a full fledged 'drunk' for lack of better words.  
Something in me clicked 72 days ago and I decided to go a week without drinking.  I was drinking multiple bottles of wine multiple weeknights and basically drinking from the second I was off work Friday until Sunday night.  I never had a rock bottom moment that made me decide to stop it just happened over time with me noticing things like I wasn't drunk after 2 bottles of wine, I can mix anything and not get sick, I wasn't even a little hung over the next day, I was so bloated and my skin looked like shit. Looking back I should have noticed a lot of rock bottom moments. I decided to save money and try to be a better mom I would only drink on the weekends.  Then after a week I added on another and probably about that point is when I realized most of my statements are those of an alcoholic but I did not, and still do not, want to admit it.  It was at this point it got hard to be sober.  Friday nights were killing me I would cry. I would cry because I missed drinking and then cry harder because it's become that hard to stop.  Then I decided to try to be sober for as long as I can but keep it on the DL aside from my hubby.  I still don't say I quit drinking.  I say I am not drinking right now.  Even tho deep down I WANT to be sober forever.  I guess I'm creating low expectations incase I don't keep going. 
Not drinking is easy now.  But it's the little voice that's telling me it was easy so now I can handle drinking in moderation.  I know that is not true, I know me and if I have even 1 drink ill give up completely. 
Eventually told my parents (my dad is a recovering alcoholic using AA sober like 32 years) and they were super supportive and I felt so much better after saying the words outloud.  It was hard to say but also felt like a million pounds came off my shoulders just talking about it.  

Anyway, didn't mean to write such a novel!   Excited to come here for support and advice!",56

This week's has been Halloween. Not because I went out on Halloween for one last hoorah (I didn't), but also because it was Sunday which is the night I always stop when cutting back so I can try to have sober weekdays. And bonus- it was also the last day of October. Three reasons to stop, yeah?

But then the holidays are coming up, can't I drink during those one last time? Especially since I'll be spending them alone this year. All those days I'll automatically get off of work with nothing to do...

But then of course is New Year's Eve. One last night to drink before finally going sober in 2022. But New Years Eve is on a Friday... I can't have my last night drinking be the start of the weekend. I have to wake up for work and be miserable on a Monday to remind myself of why I'm done, right?

Next up is my birthday. It happens to be on a Monday this year. Maybe I'll cut back for the next two months, then have one last week of drinking and remembering how miserable it makes me at work the next day... and the Sunday before my birthday will be the last. This next age will be a sober one.

**There will always be a better day.**

A little background information, although I have been blessed with such a great life, I struggle with mental health issues.  I had a major depressive episode out of nowhere in 2009, and it led straight into a year+ of just constant existential depression.   Pretty much all day every day, and I was so confused. Through treatment I eventually came out the other end of this journey with my depression under control. More recently, with depression mostly in the rear view mirror, on came anxiety and Bipolar 2.  I’ve probably gone too long already, but I just wanted to share that history as it is relevant to my quest to achieve sobriety.

I used to drink to get drunk every weekend, but that was from roughly age 16 through my mid 20’s. I’m 36 now and drink about 2-3 drinks a couple times a week. Or at least I used to.  I wouldn’t be hungover, but I did start to notice a pattern.  Anywhere from  1 to 3 days after I drank … I noticed that all of the progress I had made with my mental health felt like it disappeared. I would become easily triggered and about 50% of the time experience a full blown panic attack.  It took me a while to notice the pattern, but then it became clear.  Although my drinking is relatively tame (2 or 3 drinks) something happens in my brain and on comes the surprise panic attacks, or sometimes full blown mental breakdowns.  

Two months ago, my wife was 8 months pregnant.  She had all sorts of hormones going on, along with the general discomfort of pregnancy, and that’s putting it lightly. She needed me, but with my panic attacks, depressive episodes, and everything in between was resulting in her constantly comforting me. It should have been the other way around!  I had a conversation with myself, “Why is this about you!? She’s pregnant, and you are a burden.  She’s taking care of you like you’re a child, yet she’s the one who needs comforting and you’re about to be a dad.  Get your f****ing sh** together!”  The last time a drank was September 10.  I had a major depressive episode the very next day … and that was it.  I needed to make a change before I lost this battle with my own mental health.  That day I was very emotional.  I spent hours alone in thought and made the decision. I’m done.  My family should look to me for strength.  I felt like a symbol of weakness and alcohol was preventing me from being the person I need to be.  I’m 53 days sober today, and I hope I never go back.

Thank your to those who took the time to read my ridiculously long post. Any advice or words of support would be greatly appreciated.

I am just someone who used to use alcohol as a bad coping mechanism and now I have better coping mechanisms and I don't want to risk going back to bad ones so I stay away from alcohol.

Life is great without alcohol in it! I have a business with multiple employees. I also have multiple kids and try to be the best mom I can be. I have a good marriage and am very grateful for my husband. We stopped drinking at around the same time and never went back.

Life can also be hard, of course, but I remember how drinking only made it even harder so I stay away even during hard times. Probably especially during hard times because I remember the negatives of alcohol. I don't really feel the urge to drink much but during the rare times that I do, I tell myself to stop thinking about the ""positives"" and think about the negatives- the blackouts, hangovers and depression, that followed my binge-drinking, whether it was during a party night to try to have fun, or when I was down, to help me cope with something hard. It always made everything worse and never made anything better long-term and often not even in the short-term. 

I encourage everyone else to stick with your decision to stop drinking because life just keeps getting better and better. I hope to be able to update in another 5 years with my 10 year ""anniversary"" post. (I don't even know the exact date I stopped drinking for good but it was in the early-ish fall of 2016 when our now-5-year-old son was still a newborn.)  Best wishes to everyone.",32

I'm not even really sure what I want to say, but I think I need some support and just to feel like someone listened to me. Initially I just wanted to post that I was not planning on drinking today, and maybe about my anxiety around my excessive drinking, but I opened the post and immediately started crying....not sure if this is relief, anxiety, or what.
 
I was going to write here a bit about how long I've been drinking/how long I've had a problematic relationship with alcohol and while typing I realized I've been lying to myself to make it not seem so bad. I was going to say that I started drinking at 18...but then I remembered the second time I ever drank I was 16 and ended up in the hospital with alcohol poisoning. I was going to say that most of my drinking was more of the typical university/college kid drinking when I was 18-21, but then I remembered I started drinking a bottle of wine a day when I was 19-20ish. I was going to say that I didn't really think I had a major problem with alcohol until I was around 21-22 (I'm 26 now), but I feel like I realized that I have really been lying to myself about how bad my drinking is. It feels weird to think about not being honest with myself (let alone the countless times I've told doctors that I only have 6-8 drinks per week).
 
I feel like I'm at a point where I don't even want to drink most of the time, but I get up and pour myself another drink anyways. It feels like my brain is on autopilot, but maybe that's just something I tell myself so I don't have to feel accountable for having a drink. Sometimes I'll be halfway through a drink, actively think to myself that I don't want it (whether it's taste, I'm too drunk, or I just don't feel like having another drink) but I keep drinking it anyways. I have only been sober for 24 hours once in the past two years (today will be the second time since June). I think I'm scared of fully committing to getting sober/quitting alcohol 100% because it seems incredibly scary to face the world with no alcohol for the rest of my life, and then I think that I feel silly for being scared of not having alcohol for the rest of my life.


I'm not really sure what else I want to say here, but thank you  for reading/listening, and if you have any words of encouragement, support, or advice on cutting back/getting over the fear of being sober, I would love to hear it!",12

Still, some part of me wants to run.","I’ve always had trouble with work, and I’m trying to figure out why. I did really well in school and my parents forbade me from getting a job in high school/college. I struggled to find something after graduation, partially because I had no experience but more so because I let early rejections get to me and gave up. 

I got a job in a grocery store just so I could have something, started drinking a ton, and continued to work retail while doing internships. Eventually I got a great job at a prestigious company (albeit one that’s notorious for being an awful work environment). The constant revolving door of employees + the expectation of showing up at welcome/goodbye happy hours + my already established drinking habits were the perfect storm. Drinking was my only relief in that life, and I felt so awful that I quit and moved home because I hated working to drink and pay rent.

Then covid hit, and all of my interviews dried up. I started caretaking for a family member and getting sober and working on my health. This was enough to create a feeling of progress, but I was also avoiding the job market. I cringe when I look at my resume, let alone retype it into an application. I feel too jaded and lost to write a sincere cover letter. 

I just moved with my family and urgently needed money as my savings have run too low. I got the exact same grocery job I got after graduation, knowing I could do it and with the mindset that I need to be working no matter what. I think that this is right, but have a tinge of dread, like I am not where I am supposed to be. Like I have moved backwards in life. 

Which like, duh. Progressive addiction will do that. I could be grateful that I could get this job, and understanding of the fact that I didn’t like what I was doing and have to pivot. Moves like that take time, and yeah, to move in a new direction can mean a few steps backward.  

I think I am still feeling old judgements-the things people said to me about being “too smart” to do what I was doing. And the fear that no one will ever take me seriously again because of my spotty history. And the real frustration of not knowing what I want, being rejected, and not liking where I am. I wish I could just start over and not be me anymore sometimes, and it’s sad that I feel that way, because I’m proud of me now just not me on paper. Thanks for reading.

The above was something I came across in in one of the several audiobooks I've been listening do while I go on longer walks and it really hit home. I struggle with depression, which was one of my biggest drivers to drink. While drinking, I lived a life that I'm not always proud of; I know I hurt people and did a lot of damage to myself. Often times, I drank out of shame, which further fed shame about my drinking that enabled more drinking. It was an ugly cycle. 

The above quote is helpful to me because it reminds me that something good (my sober life) can come from something gross and unsightly (my drinking life) and I wanted to share this. Perhaps it'll inspire you to look at less-than-great moments of your life as something to grow from rather than be buried in.

2021-11-03 16:07:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qm2zut/reflecting_on_early_recovery/,Reflecting on early recovery,"This time last year I was killing about a gallon of wine a night. I was buying those barefoot boxes of wine- which are equivalent to four bottles, and just drinking them until I passed out and I would get up in the morning and pick it up and there would be one or two glasses left. 

I had by that time in my life encountered many people who were chemically dependent on alcohol to the point where they couldn’t get through the day without it and because I was not that far gone I figured that my drinking was under control.

I would go out to social events and my friends who drink what you would say is a normal amount of alcohol would be alarmed at how much I could put away. I largely kept it together in social situations but my mental health was horrible and I hated myself all the time.

Fast forward a few months I moved back in with my mom because I had gotten evicted during the pandemic and she was so alarmed my drinking that I decided to start going to AA and hire and addictions counselor.

I quit AA after about 10 weeks because I had decided that I did not want to give up alcohol entirely and that I did not need to do that to live a full and happy life. I also was not a fan of admitting powerlessness- I had been made to feel powerless in many situations in my life and I knew powerlessness was what had kept me sick for so long.

Using a sobriety tracker, a drink counter, and a general rule of thumb of not letting myself be at home so long that I would kill a bottle of wine a night I was able to successfully moderate for about 10 months this year. I had a glass of wine or maybe two at night. If I was feeling extra squirrely I would drink the whole bottle and then the next night not drink at all.

Then a little short of three weeks ago I stress drank double ipas for three days in a row and on the fourth night I got wasted at the bar. On my way home had an epic meltdown of hating myself, hating my life, and hating everyone around me. It took about 10 minutes for me to think myself into that horrible place and 12-16 hours to recover. In short I finally had the scare that so many addicted people have that propels them into recovery. I haven’t had a drink since, and I don’t want to drink again. 

And now I feel a lot of strange things. My best friend of 15 years is already seeing a massive change in my personality. I’m *happy* which for like most of my life was as unfamiliar to me as air would be to a fish. 

And the other thing I am feeling is incredibly lonely. I live in rural PA and if you know PA people we are DRINKERS. The only recovery game in town is AA and I profoundly disagree with most of their philosophy. I am blessed to have friends who don’t drink to excess and they also don’t expect me to drink- plenty of them saw me wasted and ridiculous and I’m sure they are relieved that I’m sober. 

I thought I was just making a health choice: alcohol makes me crazy so I won’t drink it. And I truly don’t have that desire to drink. Moderating like I did means I don’t have cravings. 

But I didn’t realize that even only drinking what society would call a “normal” amount of alcohol could still numb so much of who I am. I’m not experiencing huge tides of emotion but they are still there subtly. I feel a vague sense of grief, of anger, of directionlessness and loss. 

I’m angry at the people who left me when I was sick. I’m unsure of how to approach the people who stayed with me. I’m a bit angry at myself for who I allowed myself to become under the influence of addiction. And I don’t know where to go from here.",6

Anyway, I want to experiment more with long term sobriety, however, I am a uncertain about AA. I live in a small, remote town, and there is an AA group.

As a homebrewer, and someone who has always loved alcohol to some degree, it has come time for me to take a break. I don't even remember the last time I took a break in the past 10-15 years from alcohol that was more than 5 days long.

I realized it was time to take a break after realizing that some recent health issues I started to go through were not mental health issues but actually textbook alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Heart flutters, anxiety, insomnia, a general feeling of mental and physical weakness. I soon realized that was I was feeling wasn't a hangover, but simply withdrawals. This was meaning it's time to take a break and to renegotiate my relationship.

I'm on day 4 and I'm feeling pretty good. I did have to use some Xanax to help with Day 1 (and almost Day 2, but halfway through Day 2 anxiety subsided). Right now it's mostly ""feel good, but lower energy"" type stuff.

For those that don't know, withdrawal feels like a week-long hangover where you literally think of yourself as  being crazy, and is totally not ever worth getting to this point again.

My question is, once my break is over (say until Thanksgiving), if I decided to indulge and to actually stick to a strict regime that would never allow myself to get back to where I was, is it likely for any withdrawal symptoms to reoccur if I went from ""heavy"" to ""moderate/occasional"" drinking?",5

For over a year before I quit, I felt the constant need to be aware of exactly how much alcohol I had in my house at any given time.

And the worst part was that this inventory always seemed to be shrinking at an increasing pace and had to be refilled immediately after work or often during the workday. Even on the rare days that I decided to take off because my body was telling me: ""not again!"" I had to make sure that I had enough in the house to get a good buzz on, just in case.

All that time and energy spent doing the mental calculations, cycling through liquor stores so that the staff didn't think I needed to visit so often, sneaking the goods back into my house so my neighbors or my wife didn't see it, dealing with impossible numbers of empties that I needed to ditch somewhere before recycling day so that I could escape judgement.

It's a great milestone to celebrate, and I'm really proud of myself for hitting it. I'd recommend it to anyone, regardless of their relationship with drinking.

Around a month ago, I met with a specialist in order to get some professional help with my drinking. Based on my personal history with alcohol, she prescribed me Naltrexone, to be taken in accordance with the Sinclair Method. I haven't taken it yet, but I've done a lot of research on TSM, so I feel like have a good sense of what to expect going in. That being said, I'd love to hear about others' experiences with it. Some people on this sub had positive things to say about Naltrexone/TSM, so that's encouraging.

I've also read numerous posts on this sub about the dangers of moderation, and I have to say I'm really grateful that I did. I think it's really tempting to tell ourselves that we're different; that our drinking problem isn't that bad, or that the term *alcoholic* doesn't really apply to us. Reading about how so many others have tried (and often failed) to moderate their drinking puts things into a broader perspective for me. My takeaway is this: I'm probably not special, and even with pharmacological help, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to drink ""moderately"", whatever that means for me.

My strategy is to give TSM my best good faith effort, to work closely with my doctor, and to be completely honest with myself about how it's going.. But regardless of how this excursion goes, I know that I can always return to sobriety.

Oh, and I'll be sure to reset my day counter (need to think about if/how I'll even use that moving forward).",3

Today, I'm 1 month sober.","[Here's the link to the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/nagsr5/i_drove_my_car_off_a_cliff_and_i_need_help/), which I unfortunately deleted at some point (while drunk, of course). The comments give a lot of context, but here's a brief summary: After consuming over 3 bottles of wine, no food, and no consideration of my fragile mental state, **I triggered a breakdown resulting in me driving my car off a cliff.** I posted in desperation, not because of the accident, but because **I was terrified that despite what happened I didn't want to stop drinking - I couldn't even entertain the idea.**

A few really, really lovely people from this sub continued to talk to and listen to my cries on a semi-regular basis. They offered their time, kindness and consideration despite me still drinking heavily every day and showing no intent of stopping.

It must have taken extra effort and patience, because I was beyond denial: I didn't even look at my blood test results from the ER after my crash because though I knew I was turbo-charging my way an early death, I didn't want to know *exactly* how close I was. During my mandatory AA meetings, I couldn't even say ""..and I'm an alcoholic"" without adding ""I guess"" to distance myself from it.

The DUI and court proceedings didn't make me want to quit. Getting COVID didn't stop me either. In fact, after making that post, my drinking only got *worse*. By September, my morning routine started with finishing the drink left on my nightstand from the night before. I stopped showering. I stopped walking my dog. I stopped going outside. For my birthday, my family got me twelve 4-packs of my favorite hard cider because it was the only notable thing I clearly liked. I finished them in 5 days.

It was normal for me to go 24-72 hours without sleep. The only way I would sleep was by getting black out drunk, which was getting harder and harder to do because of my tolerance. I still tried anyways, of course.

My memory was non-existent, and I had no goals. I had no thoughts, no hobbies, no interests that spanned beyond drinking. If I had a feeling, I was so detached from it that I couldn't name what the emotion was. With no past, present or future, **I didn't feel like a person.**

During a 3-day bout of no sleep and the patience of the person receiving my incoherent messages, I had a revelation. It sounds silly, but you'll have to trust me. I took a picture of myself that night as a visual representation of what my rock bottom looked like.

After finally getting some sleep, I went to start my usual routine by reaching for that drink on my nightstand. But this time, after the first sip, I paused. The moment it hit my taste buds I thought: *I don't like this. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm tired.* I haven't craved alcohol since.

My first few days sober, I kept busy by fixing up my mess of a life one thing at a time. I cleaned my room, did my laundry, and deleted my food delivery apps. By the 3rd day, I started shaking violently and had a mild seizure. I found out that my alcoholism was bad enough to where it was dangerous to quit cold turkey. I was told to cut my consumption in half each week, but I couldn't do it. **The withdrawal symptoms only spurred my hatred for being an alcoholic**; it took me hours to finish a single can of cider. I begrudgingly drank 1-2 a day for 4 more days, and have been doing great with 0 ever since.

After about a week, my newfound hygiene and mental clarity gave me the courage to go outside again. I started taking my dog on 15 minute walks. They got longer every day and are now 1 hour walks. I re-discovered my passion for baking, cooking and coloring. I started earning more money than I spent without alcohol on my grocery list. I've lost 10lbs despite eating twice as much. Day by day, I find out new things about my own personality, thoughts on life, and what I want for the future. I feel happy, sad, angry, hungry, and tired. **I feel like a person, finally, after so many years.**

I hardly even recognize the person in my original rock bottom photo even though it was just a month ago. It's both terrifying and terrific to look at and think about. My entire adult life I have been abusing alcohol, so the road to recovery is going to be long. I've lived life more this month than I have in years. I'm excited and ready.

For anyone who stuck through this novel, I wanted to thank all of you. Not just those awesome few from this sub that reached out to me when I made my first post, but to the entire community. I lurked around here for a long time despite the fact that I wasn't quitting. I think this sub served as a lifeline that kept the thought of quitting on my mind, even if I was actively shoving it to the back of my mind.

**I'm happy to finally join you as a person. A sober person.**

And at first, I was HAPPY ALL THE TIME. I felt more present and grateful to not be hungover all the time.

But now I’m short of patience with the kids, they’re hard to get ready for preschool, they complain about their food, someone has always pooped and needs to be wiped or changed, and even if I want to cook them dinner the whole time they’re crying about “when will it be ready????” (at 4pm) and wanting to help.

A little over a year ago, I wasn't certain if I could finish my dissertation, much less get a job in such a tight market (if you don't know, the academic job market is just awful. Jobs are few and hard to come by and the application process is lengthy). I was thinking of just not finishing and possibly just ending my life. And now I'm going to defend sometime next month and I am interviewing for a job next week. 

Just so you know, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. It's not my ideal job nor is it in my ideal geographic location, but it's a job putting to use all of the knowledge and training I've been 8 years in doing. Maybe it means that I can get a better job with time. I still think about drinking. I still wonder if drinking will make it better. I even had the thought that taking a shot before my interview might help! Bananas. 

Quitting drinking made this possible. And it WAS NOT EASY. It is still sometimes very difficult. I was sitting around last night thinking back to my first month and how impossible it felt. How, I wondered, can I stay sober, write a dissertation, and get a job? So to those of you in the early days, stick with it, if only just for today. It's going to suck for a very, very long time.

Initially, I suggested that we both try this thing together because it would be much easier that way...don't bring alcohol home, neither of us orders drinks if we're out for dinner, etc.  We both look bloated and tired all the time and we have a big family event coming up in about a month.  I thought it might help us feel better about ourselves, physically and mentally, and lesson our anxieties about being with my family for an extended weekend.  We're both considered heavy drinkers (4+ drinks a night, 5-6 days a week), even though we would never admit it to each other.  He shrugged his shoulders and said that it's fine if I try. 

Anyway, Day 2 was really rough.  I had to travel pretty far for work, I was cranky and tired, SO got in an argument with our 6 y/o, baby was unhappy because he's teething, etc.  I got a bottle of wine out, looked at if for a long time, decided it wasn't worth it and walked away.  Later in the evening, SO was drinking a hard cider in the kitchen while we were cooking.  I said how good it looked but that I didn't want one.  He asked our 6 y/o to go out to the garage and bring him another bottle.  Then he opened it and set it right down in front of me.  

Is this a test?  Does he not take me seriously?   Is he really in that much denial about our drinking?  I really, really wanted to take a sip.  I almost caved.  I said ""No thanks, but I appreciate it!"" and handed the bottle back over the island.  He made a joke about drinking alone, clinked the two bottles together and was happy to finish both.  

It's Day 3 now and I had a rough night with the little one but I feel more clear headed than I have in quite a while.  I'm SUPER proud of myself for walking away from a drink TWICE last night but also worried about what support, or temptations, I'll have over the next 27 days.   I live in the US State with the most alcoholics and binge drinkers than any other state in America (any guesses which one?).  It's part of the culture here.  I don't have anyone to talk to for encouragement or advice and I feel very alone.

Thank you so much for reading what turned out to be a novel.

People started spreading rumors I was pregnant. I get judged for not drinking. People think it’s odd. That’s a serious problem. I didn’t even think about it until I quit drinking (I have had alcohol in almost a year, only had drinks on the weekends). The only way I made friends in college was partying. Now I’m essentially friendless. People say I don’t like to have fun because I don’t party, people think it’s odd I refuse to pick up just one beer. What has society come to? I see so much glamorization on social media platforms, movies, music, etc. When will society recognize this as a problem? And if I bring it up how much it’s glamorized people hate on me or call me boring. THIS IS A PROBLEM. Sorry this is probably not a typical post you see in this subreddit, but the glamorization of alcohol is such a severe problem in society. Anyways i wanted to give people here some hope: My uncle was an alcoholic, has been clean for 30+ years, and is now one of the top surgeons in the country. He almost failed out of college, had to take time off like myself. Anyways I know this is more of a sociology/political post, but I’ve been shamed for being sober, for wanting sobriety off of the things I was previously addicted to, and I’m just now realizing what a problem this is in society and the media. Wish everyone best of luck in sobriety.",17

Mostly just lurked until now. I tried to quit months ago (my flair is screwy, I've been trying to fix it) and managed to swap one addiction for the other by relapsing into obsessive food issues I've struggled with for most of my life.

I don't want to get into too much detail, it's ugly, but I was wondering if anybody could share how long it took for the bloating to go away. Trying to stay sober while also trying to force myself to eat adequate food is hell right now because I can't shut off the voice in my head obsessing over my inflated lower abdomen.

I know it's different for everyone, I could really just use some perspective and/or encouragement.

Much appreciated. IWNDWYT.",5

Going on a week and a half I've been struggling with the whole package: heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheaded with a sense of doom... it was bad enough Saturday that I almost left work to get myself checked to make sure I wasn't actually dying. Luckily, I already had a doctor's appointment scheduled for Monday and after going through all of the tests she's pretty sure that it is just mental and not physical. Which is good but also annoying because that means there isn't a quick fix. I have no idea if it's related to quitting alcohol or if its just a Me and My Screwy Mental Health^(TM) thing. Either way it sucks and I really wish that I could have a drink just to get some peace in my own damn head. But... not this time.   

 Yesterday I bit the bullet and went to an all-women's AA meeting. It wasn't something I was planning on. I *had* planned to go to a SMART meeting but it was canceled, so rather than waste the motivation I had worked up I decided to go to this instead. I was prepared for it to be shitty. Almost everything I'd heard about AA was negative and judgmental, both of the process and the people who participate. It wasn't what I expected. I can definitely see why some people think it's cult-y, but I can also see the comfort in the repetition and the prayer (even if I'm not religious myself). No idea if it will end up being something that I will stick with long term but the feeling of community and acceptance really was something else. I've never walked into a room and felt such a  pure positive energy. Everyone had a common goal- to be better and to help you to be better.   

 I'm also feeling oddly attached to my chip. I wasn't sure I would bother getting one because I've always been more prone to binge drinking over daily. 24hrs isn't a milestone for me. Besides, isn't counting days stupid, desperate, and putting far too much emphasis on the problem rather than the solution? Maybe, but maybe that's a little shortsighted considering how stupidly desperate I was when I was justifying my addiction. Maybe there is something to having a symbol- something you can look to and remember your commitment and why you made it. 

No matter what I end up getting from the meetings long-term I'm glad I went. At the very least I feel like less of a judgmental prick for being open to the experience. Being in recovery itself is a new experience, so there isn't anything to lose by accepting the potential for support, it any of its forms.",24

I had a horrendous night last night and it was the hardest night I've had staying sober thus far. I decided to try out AA last night for the first time because why not. 

I truly mean no disrespect, I know AA really helps a lot of people, but the religious aspect felt so alienating for not only non-religious people but for non-Christians in general. The program claims to not be affiliated with any religious sect but at the end of the program they recited the Our Father prayer which is straight up Christian. I honestly feel so upset when people give all credit to God for their accomplishments when the person they should really be praising is themselves (and their support system)! I know it works for some people but that is such a core principle of mine that the foundation of AA doesn't align with my world view. 

Where are people to go when they don't believe a higher power is what they need to ""save"" them? Kind of rhetorical but if you have any suggestions I'd love to know.

But now it's time to make the cut.

I don't feel attractive and my self esteem is non-existent.

So far for how things stand. I also know from experience that if I stop drinking, all of the above will get better, I've been there before. I have everything at my disposal. An affordable rent, a loving relationship, a degree. I just have to get out there and get it, but I'm so stuck in my rut that it pains me physically and psychologically.

It just happens to be full of different events that might be difficult, but certainly don't have to be.  

I had had thoughts of this day in the back of my mind, knowing I would be involved in a number of things.  And I future-tripped so hard about today that last night I sat in bed completely anxious, trying to control my breathing, and overall feeling awful.  I had built this day into such a ""hard"" one, so much so that I really thought I would be buying booz this morning and going about the things I had to do today, the same way I had previous to 146 days ago . . . by drinking.  ""Cutting the edge off"", whatever.  I don't see any need to, and I've come to so enjoy and cherish being me and being level, and having better mental clarity.  Maybe I am a little more flat now that I don't drink, and it doesn't make me as fiery, or whatever the case may be, when giving presentations.  I used to get a lot of praise for that spirit.  But most people didn't know that I was altering my state to get that way, only slightly when presenting, but afterwards, it would be off to the races.  Waking up the next day just feeling completely wrecked.

So, I'm pretty sure I'll be just fine today.  It's another day.  Very few things would be so important to completely future-trip over to the place where I am nearing a panic attack and considering drinking just to make it through a couple of hours.  I write myself to remind myself of that, and to ""hold"" myself to that, in the sense that, now that I've stepped back from it all (and I know I'm being vague about ""it"") . . . drinking is never actually worth it.

It was weird in the beginning not to drink. At some point, it became normal.

Okay so I just returned back to the states yesterday to seek treatment here because I was living and working in Vietnam for the last 6 years and they don't have suitable treatment options for westerners available right now. I'm looking to go into a 30 day rehab while here and then returning back to Vietnam in Feb. 

Here's the gist. So I have been drinking almost every night for the past 8-9 years. Didn't really start counting until about 6 years ago. The longest break I went through was nearly a month, but that was due to a stay at home lockdown and not through my own willpower. Before that the longest consecutive days I had gone without booze on my own was 6 days.

-I've been drunk on the job countless times
-used to hide vodka in my thermos and drink while working 
-missed work
-talked about suicide and wanting to kill myself while drunk at work
-started fights with guys that could kill me in one punch
-started insane drunken fights with family, friends, girlfriends, neighbors
-woken up in my own urine a lot , pissed on my ps4 twice 
-gone through so many benders (drinking all day everday for weeks on end)
-scream in my sleep almost every night when drunk
-tried to jump the balcony multiple times
-had the cops called on me 
-been in multiple motorbike accidents, lost a tooth
-was restrained by 6 or 7 security staff at a work Christmas party with everyone looking on in horror

There's more but I think you get it. I know I'm lucky to be alive and still have people who support me. The job that I did all that crazy shit at didn't even fire me (wtf?) My girlfriend of 6 years is still with me. I have no idea how that's possible, she doesn't even drink. 

Going to rehab for the first time. I've been an open book with all my friends and family about all the insanity me and my drinking have caused. I still get friends who say you just need to sort it out and dry out for a couple months. Still brothers who say you're just being dramatic. 

I don't know what else to say. I have bad jet lag, but I won't drink today. Even if I wanted to I couldn't so that's good.",11

The first night, I fell down some stairs and left myself with an extreme bruise on my hip/butt-cheek that was swollen to the point where I could hardly sit in the car and it's the blackest bruise I have ever had.  I also cut my wrist on my bracelet, which bent to the point where I will need to take it to the jeweller.  I remember this happening, and I lay there on the floor weeping, then got up and kept drinking. 

The second night, I have no memory but I woke up with carpet burn on my knee that bled in the bed. 

The third night, I caused myself a black eye by banging my head onto the tiles in an attempt to self harm (I don't remember this, but my partner saw me).  And worryingly, my entire thigh skin is numb to the touch and I have no idea what caused this - no bruise, just numbness like I had slept on that side too long and cut off blood flow too long maybe.  Will the sensation ever come back?  

Now, I'm covered in injuries. Some of them are punishingly visible.  Potentially permanent.  I have no idea how to get out of this mess.

Tonight I'm not drinking but I just have no hope in myself.

Edit mostly for myself: so it’s been 7 days. My bruises are healing, the feeling DID come back in my thigh, my black eye has faded almost completely and I feel mentally much clearer. I read This Naked Mind this week and I will find another book soon to keep going. It felt good to be working on the problem and the book gave me a great sense of relief.

Do I stay completely sober? Is that weird? I never intended to completely stop drinking forever just get back to moderate/healthy levels but the thought of touching a glass with alcohol in it instead of water or tea seems bizarre now. 

Do I go for the low alcohol versions? Mocktails? Do I have one normal drink for the whole night then stick to soft drinks? My friends are lovely but I’m not in a position to explain why I’m not longer drinking like a party fish they’re used to.

I realised it had taken me less than four hours between cracking the crispy seal on yet another bottle of Jack Daniel’s to pouring out the last drop. Then I mentally berated myself for not buying a litre instead as I wasn’t satisfied with how drunk I was.

It stopped feeling good years ago and yet it was still my nightly routine, to ‘relax’.

That was hallowe’en night, GF and son in bed as usual and me drinking alone after they’d gone up, as usual.

I don’t know where this is going as I have been able to avoid the rack of bottles facing me from behind the supermarket checkout so far but that cannot last forever. I will have to face it soon but for now at least this will be my third night of saying..

At some point that became 6 months as a year seemed damn long. But now that 6 months is approaching, I feel good! I am reintegrated with my family after a long deployment and have gotten through all my old triggers just fine. Had a wonderful Halloween with the kids, booze free!

My wife and I still have our issues, as does any marriage, but it's much easier to smooth things over when I'm not a drunk asshole. It is kinda funny that my wife lost her trump card to win every argument though; now we both have to fight fair! Haha... but all kidding aside, I think I've proven to my wife that I can be a good husband and parent to my kids. If anything, she knows now that I'm capable of it so I don't want to go back to drinking.

I don't have cravings or anything now. There is the occasional ""wouldn't it be nice..."" but I just remind myself of the nauseous hangovers, anxiety-ridden mornings, fatty liver, angry spouse, expense, etc. I've never moderated alcohol in the past so I don't see how that would change now.

Taking things one day at a time but I am looking forward to 6 months. Longest I've abstained since I was a teenager, over half a lifetime ago.

In this year alone I have been dumped, and lost my father to a terrible disease. (M.S) Losing my girlfriend is what really pushed me off the rails. It happened on January 1st, and I still can’t get over her.  I thought I would be okay after a few months but nothing feels the same. She was the only person I trusted and felt I could do things with. I had to stop working because of a problem I’m still having neurologically.  Doing nothing all the time made me sad.  Knowing each day was going to be the same… school then sleep. I fucking hate it. To top it all off about a month ago my father died.  I still haven’t processed it.  I have dreams where he is there, walking like he used to. (He’s been Paralyzed from M.S since I was a child). I just don’t know where I am right now in my life. I’m 18 and have already dealt with more than most adults I know. Its not fucking fair. I wish I had the guts to pull the trigger but I don’t. I just sit on my ass and drink myself to death everyday.  It started small but now I drink vodka until I can’t see.  I wish I didn’t feel like this but there is nothing here that holds meaning. I don’t wanna be here.

Does anyone else have anxiety about having people over to their house? How do you work through the anxiety without alcohol? I'm an ACOA and the state of  my childhood house was always a source embarrassment and shame so i still have trouble when people come into my house as an adult even today.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning Stop Drinking family! Thank you for all your honest and compassionate responses yesterday on the topic of loneliness - there were some great ideas on how you combat it, with a frequent theme of gratitude for this sub and being able to come here to both seek and give support. 

Being given the opportunity to host the Daily Check-In is a great way to foster feelings of connection and shared bonds with other sobernauts - I genuinely grin and grimace at my phone each time I see familiar faces (names) celebrating their wins and acknowledging their struggles. I feel I got to know a lot of you on a deeper level yesterday, and I’m very grateful you let me do that. 

I’m also grateful that you all showed up and participated, ‘cos I’d feel pretty daft out here all alone! 

I’m grateful for my dog, Josephine The Destroyer, and my guinea pigs, Sean and Les Conneries. I’m grateful for my warm bed, my tiny apartment and enough food to eat. I’m grateful for having some students again after the financial disaster of COVID, I’m very grateful for being sober and my much improved physical and mental health. I’m grateful that I live in an area of stunning natural beauty surrounded by animals and untamed savage landscapes. 

These are my treasures. This is my wealth. And they are not up for comparison against anything else. What are you grateful for this morning?

I won’t lie and say life has gotten “easier” for me in these last five weeks — in fact, a few life things aren’t really going my way right now — but being sober is allowing me to tackle the challenges head on without all that crazy alcohol driven anxiety and fear. 

I’m starting to go longer and longer periods of time without even thinking about alcohol — but I know it’s risky to get too comfortable with recovery, so am hoping to be more of service to others and trying to figure out how.  Maybe I can help others who want a sober accountability buddy or some other way to give back. Ideas welcome!

2021-11-03 02:20:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qlocu7/alcohol_as_a_motivator/,Alcohol as a motivator,"This is my first post, and I'd really like to cut down my intake. I'm finding the most difficult part to be separating it from my idea of an ideal night. I love pouring myself one or two large glasses of bourbon (usually three or four fingers each) and having the entire night to read some book I'd typically find more challenging than what I'd usually read for fun, or find a channel on YouTube or course on Udemy, or find and work on some other kind of project. I enjoy the taste of it, but also find the alcohol as a means to get myself into a deeper groove and continual motivator for being able to stay at something for longer and more in depth than without (I've tried tea or soda or junk food and lots of other things that don't have the same effect).

The problem now is that I'll set myself all up for what I hope is one of those ""productive"" nights, but just end up getting off track and drinking the whiskey anyways. And then I'll end up trying to bribe myself into one of those nights if I'm not particularly in the mood. So whether productive or not, I'll end up with just way too many nights of the week doing this, which is on top of already casually drinking moderate levels of wine and beer during the week.

I'm usually able to control the intake to what I know I can deal with some tiredness and slowness the next day. But if I know I'll have a completely open weekend, there's nothing I'd rather do than have my typical bourbons with an extra bottle-and-a-half of wine until 5am and sleep off the hangover the next day.

I don't know if anyone's read A Spell for Chameleon by Piers Anthony, or more recently (and much less sexist) the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson? >!In each book, there are characters with variable intelligences—like completely stupid one day, but a genius another. One's on a regular schedule, another completely at random!<. In any case, I feel like that's what alcohol—at its best—is to me: having the keys to turning on that part of my brain. It's like having the ability elevate myself and make things more interesting, but at the cost of shittier other days and potential/eventual fucking liver damage (I love shitting on anti-vaxxers as much as the next person, but can't help but realize how hypocritical I am with the science on alcohol). I have no capacity for monitoring food intake when I'm tipsy or hungover. And I can tell that my memory, energy and motivation for day-to-day things is significantly impacted compared to when I'm able to go a few weeks without alcohol.

Overall, I guess I've always known I'll need to eventually cut back, but not until I was ""older"" (I'm in my early 30's now, which I'm realizing how much of a difference that is relative to with or without alcohol). Part of what I've told myself about these nights is that it's also a way to reach further and achieve more than I would without it, while still making it fun and enjoyable. And I'm very lucky to have achieved what is probably an exceptionally good day-to-day life. But now that I've gotten pretty much everything that I've strived to achieve, I still want to continue to some extent for the enjoyment of it. Just without the repercussions.

So if I'm going to succeed in cutting back, is it a matter of just being able to accept the lower highs and higher lows together? Or has anyone had success in actually substituting alcohol as a motivator?",3

I recently met someone and I’ve fallen for them HARD. Not to get into it too much, but they are going through a major transitional phase and set a boundary with me that they aren’t ready to jump into anything right now, which I completely respect, and will continue to do so. 

That being said, this is my first time having feelings for someone in a completely sober state since probably high school, and it’s so intense, it’s almost like mental torture, especially not knowing where I stand within their boundaries. I’m having a hard time distinguishing what feelings I have that are real, and what is simply just me overreacting to something completely new, unrestricted by alcohol.  Im afraid I’ll end up doing something stupid that could ruin my chance to be in their life altogether.

**The Good:** I am back in my sweet little apartment in San Francisco for a couple of weeks.

**The Bad:** I would love to propagate the fiction that—between the Adirondacks, Florida, and California—my life is jet set and cosmopolitan, but the truth is that I am simply pinwheeling from one disaster to another. A bad septic tank and a rodent infestation in the Adirondacks, hurricane and mold cleanup in Florida, and now I’m going to spend my entire stay in San Francisco clearing out the storage rooms under the back stairs and in the basement of my building.

**The Controversial:** America has become divisive. We are a nation of people who are separated by strong opinions on one crucial issue, and emotions are running high. That’s right—I am talking about coconut-flavored La Croix. I had heard so much about it, both from people who love it and people who hate it—so I *finally* decided to taste it for myself.

My opinion? It’s DELICIOUS, and I cannot believe that it took me so long to try it. (I once heard tangerine La Croix described as, “It’s like someone ate some fruit and then burped in my mouth,” and I think that put me off buying the brand.)

I got triggered because we were just coming out of lockdown and people were all excited about pubs and clubs reopening so it was the talk of everyone at the time. It was summer and there’s a pub that I pass in my general day-to-day travels that puts up a big marquee outside when the weather’s nice to extend their beer garden. Every time I drove past (probably only about 4 times in total so not much really) I got more and more jealous of all the people there enjoying drinks and it triggered massive cravings. I just wanted that normality, to be able to have just one cider on a hot summer’s day. Just one glass of Prosecco to unwind after a long day. 

I didn’t recognise how much this was triggering me at the time or I’d have changed my route, although this is Britain so avoiding driving past a pub or other alcohol-related event is almost impossible, especially when everyone was enjoying their freedom to socialise again after a long 12+ months of restrictions. 

Since I relapsed, I’ve had a few days here and there of sobriety but I can’t seem to stick to it anymore. The will is gone. I think I destroyed my motivation when I relapsed because I REALLY thought I’d beaten it. I’d never made it even close to 6 months before, the previous record was 9 days so I was completely confident I’d overcome this stupid addiction. 

I hate that after almost 6 months of sobriety, I was still an addict. I’ve heard people say that you’re always an addict even when sober but I didn’t really believe that. I couldn’t understand how people who had years, or even decades of sobriety could still class themselves as addicts. Now I get it. 

Does this shit never go away? Will I always have to be consciously aware and avoidant of alcohol when I make my next decision to get sober? Does my entire life from the point of sobriety STILL have to revolve around alcohol in the sense of constantly avoiding triggers? I hate this addiction; even in sobriety it dictates how I act and what I do and how I think. The thought of living my whole life under constant vigilance toward alcohol feels just as restricting as when I’m drinking. 

This turned into more of a whiny pity party than I intended but I’m just so disappointed with myself and so frustrated that I willingly threw away 6 months of sobriety. And for what? Liver pain which is scaring the shit out of me (and I’m in too much fear to see my GP - I already had elevated liver enzymes 12 months ago). Debt. Anxiety. Blackouts. Hangovers. 

Wasn’t even worth it.",9

Only really drink on the weekends, my go to are margaritas, usually only a couple.  I also like rum and pineapple a lot.  Sometimes vodka cranberry.  Never been big on whiskey, but I have had Jack and Coke and Fireball is what I did for my 21st (they are excellent in Angry Orchard).  

So on Halloween, I’m having my regular rum and pineapple, and decide to sing a song for karaoke I think fits the spooky vibe of Halloween.  I sing “Midnight in Montgomery” by Alan Jackson.  Now, I had never done this song before, so it forced me to pay attention to the lyrics.  It was about Hank Williams’ ghost, and smelling whiskey in the air.

I then proceed to look up Hank Williams, as I was curious how long he was around and wanted to know more facts about him and his connection with Montgomery.  I find out the man met his fate in the back of a Cadillac…29…my age.  

Hold up, I need some answers here.  Apparently he abused alcohol and prescription pills.  First off, what constitutes alcohol abuse?  I drink on the weekends, am I at risk?  I eat healthy and exercise, and take vitamins…why on earth did Hank leave then??  How come he couldn’t hack it, yet we have many who used to drink a lot, yet are doing well and into their 40s and up?  I hear the liver recovers and is pretty resilient.  Also, the heart is the strongest muscle in the body.

So what gives?  Now I am afraid to drink after what I read about Hank Williams.  But I only do it in the weekends.  Is that all it takes, or am I overreacting?

Please help set me straight here, thank you.",5

Me and my lifelong best friend were planning to smoke like crazy when I finally got off of probation, within my last few weeks of probation, he died. So, after probation, I just kept on drinking, 1 to 2  six packs of beer a day for probably around a year. I haven't had anything to drink for 5 to 6 days now. Withdrawals suck, its fucked up my stomach, for some reason my body is digesting very slowly, or something like that. If I eat anything, I feel extremely bloated ALL day. Its currently 8:30 pm and all Ive been able to eat is part of a bag of chips, so probably around 60 to 70ish calories. Has anyone else experienced these kind of stomach problems after quitting drinking? Thats not the only symptom Ive had, but its the most annoying to me. Ive come on and off of many drugs in my lifetime, so Im already familiar with the flu-like symptoms, nausea, headaches, all that. Im mainly concerned about how my body is processing food now, Im hesitant to eat anything at all, all day because it makes me feel so bloated and sick. Sorry for the rambling, my mind is currently in a million different places.",3

My mom was a high functioning alcoholic for most of my life, I know the difference. I don’t have to drink to feel “normal”. I don’t get the shakes, a headache or even feel different when I don’t drink at all. 

However, almost 3 years ago my husband unexpectedly got an awesome job and started traveling Monday-Friday. We moved to a new city where we didn’t know anyone. I had a baby almost immediately after that and I also quit working (also unexpectedly). I definitely found myself drinking a few glasses of wine every night as opposed to a few nights a week. 

Then covid happened and my drinking definitely got to be more than a few every single night. I wasn’t blacking out but I didn’t feel great the next day. Now we’re 20 something months since quarantine and my drinking habits have become exactly that… a habit. Around 4 o’clock every day I start thinking about 5 o’clock and then I can have wine or a beer. I used to be able to have 1-3 drinks and know I was good. Now if I feel like if have one sip then it’s go time! Even if I’m by myself. 

I’m wondering what things people have found helpful when they’re having alcohol cravings. Or in my case just bored and stuck in a habit of drinking. I usually can’t just leave my house because of my toddler. I know some people knit, do crosswords, go on a walk. I just want to get out of this habit with other (healthier) habits. I don’t want to end up like my mom. Thanks everyone!",24

it's been a little over a year since I started abusing alcohol, using it as a coping mechanism. Starting at that same time, the worst year of my life started. Over this time, I went through a very difficult breakup, have not been enjoying my job (although that has gotten a bit better), all my best friends moved away for work or post grad school, dog died, along with some other smaller things. I sill have friends here but it isn't the same relationship as I had with my other ones.

Anyway, I go to work in the morning, go to the gym when I am done, and am home around 3. Working out REALLY helps me destress after work so I do it as soon as I can once I am finished. After that, I come home to nothing really. So as the night goes on I am left alone with my thoughts even if I am trying to preoccupy myself with something else. They sometimes, almost usually, get sad and negative   
 and  I feel lonely. It has been very easy to just go get something to drink to take my mind off things as a quick fix for the night. I don't drink constantly anymore, I managed to stop that around February/March. Currently 2 days without a drink, was 5 before that. But I really need and want a different way to help me get through a bad day or night. I am having one now and want to start a new pattern of something more positive and figure there is no better time than now.

I was wondering if anyone here had found other coping mechanisms that I could maybe do in addition to working out that can keep me going or at least in a good to decent frame of mind until it's time for bed. Thanks for any and all help!",6

The urges come in waves, when they do you have to ride them out. Some days the waves are big, and you crash. Some days they are small and will subside fast. In early recovery, like in a younger persons years of surfing you might tackle bigger waves, and fall more often. But as you get better you learn to ride out the big waves, as you get older yet, you find smaller waves and ride them with a great deal of ease. When you fall you might get towed under, but you know how to avoid the reef. How to minimize the damage and when its time to just go lay on the beach.

Day by day you notice changes, and you have to want to learn not just ride the board. How to be a better surfer, how to enjoy the hard days, and one day. You stop... you've surfed enough. It was for a younger version of you, an immature version of you, a reckless version. You can look back on the falls with no shame, you accept responsibility as to why it happened, it turn from shame, to guilt, to experience. Now you do not surf anymore, but you can teach others how to ride out those waves.

Here is to riding out the biggest gnarliest waves, here is to surfing them, here is to embracing the smaller waves, and one day retiring a respected surfer.

Today was a very productive day for me: I had the day off and I cooked, cleaned, finished a project I was working on… but then the sun went down, and I felt a wave of anxiety. I‘ve read that anxiety attacks can persist for a while after you stop drinking (I‘m at ~23 days so it‘s not acute withdrawal). so, I just distracted myself and watched some tv shows… 

Then I realized, I just feel really lonely this evening. I‘m pretty blessed when it comes to friends, but it just so happens that none of them can talk this evening. I’ve thought about journalling, but for some reason I really wanted to share these thoughts with someone.

The day I decided to stop drinking, I bought a six-pack. I drank one beer, had an anxiety attack, and decided that I was done with it. The other 5 beers are still in my apartment. I figured that people would come over and drink them, but so far everyone brought and drank their own drinks. So, here I am, in my apartment, alone with 5 beers… Loneliness is a well-known feeling for me, I live alone in a country away from my family and most of my friends. But for the first time in years, I have no urge to drown my loneliness. No part of me wants to get drunk and pity myself because nobody has time today. I just want to lie in my bed, share this with strangers, and try to accept that sometimes I‘m going to feel really lonely.

I was on a really good, positive path until about a week ago. Loving life, proud of myself and the growth I've accomplished, just overall in a really good place.

And then suddenly, I'm obsessing over a relationship that ended over 5 years ago. We lived together, were initially head over heels for each other, but towards the end we didn't connect anymore. I had unaddressed mental health issues, was self medicating, and he started pursuing a passion that had him out of the house 5-7 nights a week. All the fights inevitably led to him breaking up with me.

I did not react well, and eventually left NYC to move back to TX to be with family. He and I have spoken cordially, but briefly, since then. I've been in other relationships. Obviously I've stopped drinking, have been addressing my mental health, and have been growing as a person.

So why am I just now starting to obsess over this breakup? He is not the one that got away, but he is the one relationship I feel like I really fucked up. I hated my life while I was with him (note: my life, not necessarily my life with him, there was just no way he could make me happy when I was so unhappy with myself), so it's not like I'm having thoughts of ""woe is me, I miss you, take me back"". It's more like ""wow, we were so in love, I'm just now realizing how much my personal issues probably played into our ending"", and that's really sad to me.

I don't know what this feeling is. Regret? Remorse? Growth? I've spoken to so many friends and my sponsor about this, and I've gotten everything from ""it's normal to think of ex's"" to ""you're finally acknowledging your role in this, you're growing"".

I guess I'm just venting. It sucks. I want to grow and I'm happy with where my life currently is but also just... can we skip to the good part? Can we skip all these nasty, sad emotions? And why now,  instead of when I first stopped drinking? Why am I feeling so icky about this FIVE YEARS after it happened and MORE THAN A YEAR after I started working on myself?

Ugh.",6

Which is within 3 months of my other bunny unexpectedly passing away which happened a few days before I was supposed to leave for my grandmother’s funeral. My grandmother was the only person in my family that wasn’t an abusive piece of shit and my pet bunnies are my entire life (and only family now). It’s all so absurd that it sounds fake. 

I haven’t been handling it well and have been on a bender for majority of the year. It’s unhealthy and messing up my life and I fully realize that. It’s only making the depression worse. 

I’ve tried to stop in the past but when I stop drinking I start to have nightmares. Today is day 3 for me, and sure enough I had a nightmare about my dead best friend last night. It’s always nightmares about him and it’s a big reason why I would go back to drinking.

Not drinking alcohol for this long is something I haven't done for half of my life and I'm very grateful for getting to learn who I am again and getting to improve my life. For the past couple of years while decreasing and stopping my drinking, I have been ignoring or shutting many people out that were related to or I felt triggered my drinking (people I used to drink with, people who I thought were my friends, etc). I'm about to have a huge career change and will be ""coming out of hiding"", so to speak. Have started inching back onto social media after being off of it for a while as well and I know that people's eyebrows are perking up seeing me slink back around in places haha.

I am going to ask my career group about this but I'm also asking here, how exactly do you handle revisiting your past so to speak as someone who doesn't drink anymore? They are people I have to make amends with, but just people I knew from an old job or used to hang out with. Many people have been texting and trying to get back in contact with me and I will be starting to reach out to those people soon I guess. I don't really want to have to explain my whole story to them but I know that me not drinking will be asked about if it comes up. I think I am going to keep a lot of them out because I don't think they were true friends that I should continue to have relationships with. More importantly, how do I handle being a sober person in a career that I feel was related to my drinking in the past? I think having almost a year has given me many tools but I would love to hear some stories and advice. Thanks in advance!",6

2021-11-02 15:21:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qlby4z/day_35/,Day #35,"Good afternoon everyone!

You're probably wondering ""Why Day 35?"" Well, to tell you all the truth, I wanted to post on my 30th day of being sober; however, we have been very busy at work and I have been spending my downtime relaxing and doing some of the things I mention below. I've finally got my thoughts together for you all.

I wanted to type up this post to update you all on my progress and do a summary of my first 30-ish days in order to help anybody that might need it. Sometimes, folks might have the right idea in terms of the big picture, but the trials and tribulations of the day-to-day environment can sometimes just be a major drag!

The roughest patch in terms of cravings was the first 10 days. I didn't really want to drink to mask any emotions or get my mind distracted. I mostly wanted to drink just because it was a damn habit by that point. Subconsciously, once 5pm hit, I caught myself going to the fridge looking for that beer. Instead though, I grabbed a Dr. Pepper. 

When game days arrived on Saturday, I was wondering what to do before the game because I would get beers on ice and ready to watch the Razorbacks. Instead, I decided to cook more and get us some game day food for us, instead of getting a couple of beers in the system and deciding ""let's eat out!""

After I got past that phase, and more settled into establishing myself by not having alcohol around, it became easier. I did have a major test around mid-October, around my birthday. Thank goodness my Mom did not buy me any alcohol like she usually does for my birthday. In case she did though, I already had a plan to get rid of the alcohol without hurting anyone's feelings. To be fair, I still haven't really told her I quit drinking. I'm not sure why just yet but I haven't.

We had our dinner at a nice eating establishment. Mom and my stepmom (Mom is part of the LGBTQ+ community, she joined that community years after my parents divorced) had a few drinks themselves and even offered to buy me some. I politely declined and went for the water. They didn't really think anything of it, which was fine.

They are the kind of people that will make a three hour trip out of state and buy bottles upon bottles of fine bourbon at deep discounts and stock up on liquor. I can still tell when we play our video games online and on party chat, both of them are mixing drinks left and right. You know what though? It just doesn't phase me anymore. The only thoughts that really spring up to my head is that ""gosh I used to be just like them. It's just not for me anymore, but let them be them.""

Now I will tell you all some of the things I have noticed about myself since I've decided to stop drinking.

* It's a lot easier to get going in the mornings. 
* I still have moments to where the little things annoy the shit out of me, but thankfully, these episodes have gone down a good 50%
* My day to day routine feels slowed down. I don't really keep too many things going on at once anymore and I don't operate at the same speed. It's like I'm more deliberate in my actions and more precise on my chores and jobs I wish to do
* The brain fog has gone down a good 75%. I was telling a friend about three different books I've been reading and I was able to recall the latest chapters from each of them with relative ease. In the past, my short term memory was shot.
* In terms of work, I am going forward and making new routines and documents and other charts to help me keep up with work when things get crazy. Instead of letting it all stack up and getting pissed and finishing everything in a flurry, I chart each task, prioritize them, and chip away one by one
* My outlook is a lot better. I'd say negativity dominated me but I'm starting to be more positive and shake off the things that would put me in bad moods. I just choose not to put myself in those environments and I also choose not to gravitate and listen to negative people go on and on about their woes.

As for drawbacks, I will mention that my eating and drinking habits (sodas) need to be curbed back. Goodness I have made great progress in putting the booze down, but I have been eating some unhealthy junk!

The thing people fail to mention about Sober October is the fact that you're having to quit drinking while stores have candy everywhere, and cheap! The first few weeks, I went hard on that halloween candy. It was almost like my body was trying to replace the dopamine from alcohol with whatever sugar gives you. 

I also did a great job up until then of really curbing my soda consumption. I'd drink those carbonated sparkling waters and then about once a day have a Coke Zero when it felt like I needed a caffeine kick and it was too late for coffee.

Thankfully though, I'm to the point now to where I've gotten a lot better about discipline. 

Looking forward, I'm interested to see how things will be going by day 60. For now, I'd say the alcohol aspect has been conquered. So now, I'm trying to work on myself by reading more, specifically those self-help books and researching ways to naturally calm myself, reduce anxiety, and watch those situations where I get flustered about nothing. That's gonna be a big mountain to climb but I'm gonna take my same one day at a time, let's get a little better approach.

Work is slowing back down, so hopefully I can have some extra bandwidth and keep all of my /r/stopdrinking brothers and sisters on here motivated and encouraged, just you all have done with me. I'm a big believer in karma. 

In between, it's been a fascinating rollercoaster of emotions reading everyone's stories. Some are very tragic and thought provoking. Other stories are absolutely enlightening and hopeful! I'm glad to witness all of your testimonies and keep everything in perspective. 

We live in an age that contains this weird paradox of getting more connected with each other in terms of technology, but at the same time the world seems more divided than ever. Very odd indeed.

Thank you all and have a great day! See you all soon! One day at a time, and I will NOT drink with you today, unless its one of these Bubly Lime drinks I'm hooked on, LOL!

But the reality was that I wasn't really moving forwards....well I was, but not in any way that would last as I inevitably fell or broke again and was right back to where I started or further down than I was before. So this time feels different and I know I'm working really hard but it's hard to explain more about what's different or even what I'm working on, but I know that I am and that I'm changing and my relationships are changing too.  Its incredibly slow and painful...it can be very frightening at times, frustrating, confusing and distressing but I feel like I'm starting to build something that's more solid from which I can work from and from which I can grow.",13

Another day of no indigestion, and waking up without a hangover. Another day of not craving booze, because the demon has been effectively flushed from my mind and body after 20 years of nonstop poison. Another day of clear-headed clarity and gratitude for the little things—my job, my home, my warmth and all the possibility each entails.

My story is an echo of so many others that I've read on this subreddit. Years of trying marked by failure, stopping and starting, making and breaking promises to myself by the week. When I realized 10 years ago that alcohol was at the root of all my life's problems—health, financial, love, motivation, mental capacity, depression, anxiety (I could go on)—I knew deep down I had to quit. And it's taken me 10 years to build up the strength and mental fortitude to make it happen. My rock bottom came two years back this week, actually, when I had a drug-and-alcohol-induced psychosis, got the living shit beat out of me by police officers I called to help, and spent the night in the drunk tank broken and bleeding, fully believing society as we know it had ended.

It was a long and brutal climb out of that hole I dug for myself. And it's not over yet.

Before this year, I had never been able to go an entire month without a drink. I would make it two weeks, tops, then convince myself I was fine. I was never fine, but it was easy to tell myself I was. When the COVID lockdown hit last year, I drank every single day for months. I fell ass backwards into a beautiful, loving relationship last summer, and started to make steps towards bettering myself.

From March to May of this year I hit 50 days for the first time in my life, before some ill-advised field research. Then a bad breakup sent me spiralling for the entire month of July. But on July 25 I drank my last beer, and the next day I smoked my last crumb of weed. I can now say I've been sober for THREE ENTIRE CALENDAR MONTHS, which seems so small in the grand scheme of things. But in the context of my life I have just conquered Everest.

In that span I've been to the gym more than 70 times. I've lost 20 pounds. I'm starting to look good naked for the first time since high school. I've saved hundreds of dollars, and started an investment account. I've been nominated for a prestigious award in my field (we find out the results at a fancy gala tomorrow). And I applied for the top job at my company after learning of my boss' retirement. I interview next week.

None of this would have been possible if I was still drinking. And I have to believe that none of it would be possible without this community. I didn't really know what to say when I started this post, but I knew I had to post something to mark this momentous occasion. I feel like I've rambled on long enough now, but I want you all to know how much I appreciate you—those who have been sober for years, and those who post every day desperate for someone to listen. I hear you. And if you feel like you'll never climb out of the hole, you're wrong. I did it, and so can you.

Last October I quit drinking for 3 months, the longest I had been sober since I was 15 (now 35). I was able to do it with the support of my girlfriend and her wonderful kids in my life. 

Fast forward to June of this year, I had slowly allowed drinking back into my life and would disappear to a family cabin for a week to drink every month or so. My girlfriend had bought a new house and was moving out and I decided I couldn’t live with them permanently. We ended up breaking up and I quit my job of 9 years due to anxiety and depression. 

I spent the next 4 months drinking and camping across the province thinking I was having the time of my life. 

In October I found myself celebrating my birthday alone at my cabin, and on a 30 day alcohol bender. My ex girlfriend sent me a happy bday text and I told her I wanted to talk to her. Within 1 minute of hearing her voice I realized how far gone I was and broke down. 

I continued to drink over the next few days with her checking in on me. At one point I slipped while chainsawing and cut into my knee - I would have bandaged it and left it but she convinced me to go in an get medical attention. 

The next day I drank 25 beers in one evening and completely broke down, realizing how completely lost I was in life. She was crying for me and I could feel her disappointment in the man I had become. In that moment I realized I need help,  not just for me but for the collateral damage I was creating for those that I love. 

I’m not ready to get back with her until I’m in a better place. In two weeks I will go into a 5-8 weeks treatment, and I’m scared and excited at the same time.

I accidentally took a NyQuil pill instead of melatonin but I’m not even mad, I still have plenty of aches and pain from mystery bruises and I actually slept decently for 6 hours straight, so guess that worked out.

Today the brain fog is intense and focusing on work is insanely difficult still. I’m in the office and a close coworker’s last day was yesterday so I’m just feeling blah and irritable. I also noticed I made a call on Saturday morning from my work phone to a number I don’t know… that’s pretty anxiety inducing but haven’t heard anything from it so.. hopefully it’s nothing. Anyways, feeling much better than yesterday at least. 

Anyways, just kinda rambling. Gonna spend the day as focused on work as I can, go home tonight to clean a little more and binge some parks and rec and smoke some weed to make sure I can’t get tempted to go out and buy any liquor. Then get some good rest.

Like a lot of people I’ve read about on here, I’m not a daily drinker and sometimes I can even moderate for a bit. From time to time I can have a few drinks and stop or have a beer with family at dinner. It all eventually leads to big binges (at least once per month for longer than I care to recollect) that last anywhere from 1-3 days. This is typically followed by a hangover for a day or two and the lingering depression/anxiety for a few days beyond that.

To be honest, I think part of the problem is it’s not always seemed bad. I’ve had some really fun times with friends where we’ve drank and had fun and did dumb stuff that all just seemed like part of the fun of growing up, but it feels like it’s just lost any of that luster and now results in me drinking alone more often than not.

I’ve read Naked Mind in the past and just picked up a copy for myself today that I plan to start. I guess I’m just looking for some more advice on what type of services I can reach out to. It’s not affected my daily life to the point where I feel like I need to be admitted to any sort of inpatient rehab or detox or anything. But should I be looking into a psychologist or a counselor or something like that? Just don’t really know where to start.

I had a horrible weekend. I almost ruined my marriage and ended friendships. Today has been the first day I haven’t felt like crap. Why am I even thinking about drinking again? Is it because I put a hard stop on myself? I have never really drank every day and usually it would be one or two.

Very proud to have successfully reached two years today!

Huge understatement to say that quitting alcohol changed my life for the better. It's not always rosy that's for sure, but none of the minor negatives come close to the net positives that have accrued the last two years (and will continue to, as well.)

I do wish I'd quit permanently when I first started taking month long breaks, or first worried about my intake, or first began lurking in this sub, because then I'd have about five years instead of two. And honestly once those doubts crept into my head, the fun of drinking was already gone and my relationship with it was broken forever. Just took me a few years to realise that! 

I definitely want to give a huge thanks to this community. As someone who is still an active part of lots of heavy drinking circles without any real life sober friends, having a touchstone like this subreddit available 24/7 to browse has been invaluable in keeping me quit. 

Here's to another year 🙌🏼.",77

That might sound weird but I am incredibly isolated due to my anxiety and it's just reaching a point where I'm just desperate to be seen/noticed as a person. Maybe even a person who is struggling with alcoholism & is fighting the good fight. I know I can find those things, or something like it at a meeting but I can't get myself there. 


Leaving the house & driving is a lot for me. But I've practiced that. Going to a new place & getting lost can cause me to panic, so I give myself extra time to get there. The last time I did that I sat in the parking lot & talked myself out if it in that extra time and drove back home defeated. Not to mention walking in & having to greet people! I'm not antisocial, in fact most people in public would probably think I'm polite, maybe even kind. But I don't know how to interact intuitively and I always feel like I'm just faking it which doesn't help when I need to be seen for who I am. I even did my hair last night so I could go today, but I can't.


This is getting rambly but I've got to get it out. I've been waiting 4 months (since before I got sober) for a psych appointment. I've been on Adderall for 20+ years of my life and unmedicated for the last 3, which coincides perfectly with my alcoholism. It's just a wringer and I'm trying so hard to keep myself dry & above the water.  But I need my mental illness treated, how can I even start ""The Work"" if I can't even focus on something for longer than 3 minutes? My PTSD from a physically abusive relationship has gotten a lot better through time & my sobriety & facing unpleasant memories & thoughts on my own. I wish I had access to a therapist. My brain is such a mess right now but I know I'm working through stuff, just feel like I'm not doing it right. Shouldn't I see more from it if I was doing it right?


I don't want a sponsor yet, I just want a community. I want to feel supported and not pressured to do things I don't feel I can handle. I appreciate what I have here on Reddit, I try really hard to respond to people with compassion and depth. It's been helping me to respond to others posts. Usually I'm responding in the morning, not posting. But I just feel isolated right now and I know that's not good for sobriety.

When I first quit drinking and had to decline drinks at social gatherings, I'd sometimes say things like ""I just decided it it wasn't good for me"" when the person offering the drink seemed perplexed by my refusal. Turns out (and my wife had to explain this to me because I didn't pick up on it) my friends felt severely judged by these statements. They interpreted it as my proclaiming that I was superior to them because of my decision not to drink.

Was that my intention? No! I was just providing a quick and (I hoped) non-confrontational explanation for why I wasn't drinking. My real reasons for quitting are numerous, but I know it's not appropriate to bombard my friends with all of that information... unless they ask. In any case, it turns out that a lot of people are very VERY sensitive and/or self-conscious about their decision to drink and can feel threatened when someone around them chooses not to imbibe. I've actually had friendships fizzle out over the last couple of years and I'm convinced that my sobriety and the misconception that I'm being judgemental are contributing factors.

If I had to do it over again, I would decline drinks and never provide a reason unless pressed. And my reason would be extremely anodyne - something like ""I just don't feel like it tonight"" or similar. I guess when you tell people ""I don't think it's good for me,"" they immediately think ""Oh, he's judging me for putting something harmful in my body."" It sucks, but that's how comments like that are often perceived.

So, yeah. I guess that's my advice. Drinking is a giant societal sacred cow. Don't underestimate your friends' sensitivity to anything they perceive even remotely as an attack on their drinking habits.",33

Just yesterday I was thinking about 'the answer to everything' being 42 and I laughed because of the 42 personal stories in the Big Book.  So I watched it again and came away with this fun way I'm going to look at Hitchhiker's from now on.

I can see the plot being: the guy goes on a bender, blacks out / hallucinates, his life is being bulldozed, the 'book' with 'Don't Panic' is kinda like the Big Book, the towel is because you're going to need to clean up a lot of messes and wipe away a lot of sweat on the road to sobriety, and then the ultimate answer to all, the answer to everything, a simple and seemingly random number \*42\* - I think of the 42 personal stories because it takes this odd fellowship we have - and our sharing of stories - to succeed. And those are the 42 stories  many of us hear first, but they are there for ALL to hear if they just go look for the answers.

My mind was BLOWN. Of course, I am on day 7 and all the 'thoughts' have started and it may just be me connecting dots where there aren't any, but I had fun with it anyway. lol

So I think I will go ahead and talk about the incident first, and then what has happened over the past 48ish hours. 

So I (33, M) have had the same best friend since we were 9 years old. For this story I will call him “Jack” and his wife “Jill”. This is the story:

This past Saturday evening, Halloween weekend, Jack and Jill went out to a house party with friends. Drinks were consumed. Jill had drove them both to the party. At the end of the night (3:30 am) Jack was insisting on calling an Uber to take them home, while Jill insisted she was okay to drive home. Reluctantly Jack got in the car and they headed home. I guess during the drive home, arguments were still being had over the fact Jill shouldn’t be driving. Jill responded by saying, “we are now so close to home you could walk if you want”. Apparently, at that moment, Jack unbuckled his seat belt, opened the door, and got out of the car while the vehicle was still moving at 35 MPH. (I know, I’m absolutely stunned. I really don’t know what else to say about that specifically). Obviously, it was not good, but ambulances arrived very quickly. Jack is currently in the ICU with a fractured skull, 3 different bleeds in his brain. In the past 24 hours he was able to be taken off a ventilator and is breathing on his own. Other than that, it’s really just hard to tell the future right now. 

So now I will talk about my part of the story. I’ll start by saying I’m 134 days sober today (and definitely not my first shot at sobriety). So when I woke up Sunday morning to a text from Jill explaining the situation, obviously my heart just dropped. I don’t know, the incident is just so shocking to me. 
But I immediately hoped in the shower and then was on my way to the hospital. Besides Jill who followed the ambulance with a police escort, I was the next person there. 

So I got to sit with him, while he just laid there breathing by a machine. And just wait. And I got to hug his parents as they showed up, and then his brother, and some others. And then since only 2 people are allowed in the room at once, I was able to go out and bring people food back. When they took out the breathing tube, N-95 masks were then mandatory and I got to run to the hardware store and pick up masks for everyone. And since then I have just continued to show up and be there for him, even if it’s just sitting there while he sleeps.

I’m so thankful to be sober during this, because when I’m actively drinking I don’t show up for anything. I don’t care about anyone but myself. If I was drinking I’m sure I would figure a way to make this about myself. How it effects me more than even Jack. I would ride this as an excuse to be blacked out for days. 

But instead, I got to show up, and do the best I could to be of service. To just try and do the next best thing. And as absolutely painful as it is to be there, Jack would no doubt do the same for me. 

Also, I’m having some slight guilt and I’m doing my best to keep thoughts out like “I should have been there” or “I knew he was going to that party, I should have told him to call me for a sober ride.” I know he is a grown man capable of making his own decisions. It just sucks that I didn’t send him a text when I knew he was out partying. But when it comes down to it, Jack had so many drinks he didn’t realize he was in a moving car. So I don’t know if I could have done anything about that. But it’s still just very sad. 

I will close with this:
A few weeks ago on another subreddit I saw a video of a man with 1 leg, sitting on a sidewalk. A random stranger stops his car, pulls out a pair of crutches from his trunk and gives them to the stranger. The one legged man leaves the frame in joy. 
A comment from the video read “Helping another person in need, isn’t that really just what it is all about”

Because I’m sober, I get to be able to help out others in a time of crisis. I can’t believe I’m going to say it, but that feels better than a drink. 

If you have read this far, thank you for letting me share. And, IWNDWYT.",416

Remembering all the amazing shows, remembering all the conversations, not being the inevitable sloppy. It's surprising how many people are not loaded, but plenty,  plenty are. The bartenders know my order, and are very aware to not fuck it up. My wife drinks ""normally"" (wierdo), but I always have more energy and stamina. I do have the unlimited drink package because she does, but there is ZERO temptation at all. I play the movie forward and I know if the Kruise hadn't been postponed a year we would not be having the same great time at all. I wouldn't be able to be doing this right now if it weren't for you guys. I owe you the biggest thank you.

I even went to a small Halloween gathering over the weekend - it was my first alcohol focused event in well over a year and a half now and I was surprised at my complete lack of interest in tasting any of the fancy drinks. I did smell a few because the ingredients were interesting but that was more than enough to satisfy any curiosity I had.

I've been pretty inactive on this sub for a while, BUT it was a huge part of my early alcohol-removal days. I feel SO MUCH better physically and emotionally, and in about a month I'll be weed-free for a year as well and am never going back to smoking either.

I had told a few friends I'd decide after a year if I would drink again. I've found that limiting myself (with anything) so concretely gives me anxiety so instead of telling myself I will ""never"" drink again, I am simply saying that I don't foresee a scenario in which I would add alcohol back into my life any time soon.

But here's what had changed over the pandemic:  Day drinking.  Because of kids and other logisitics, it's been easier to get together at 2 or so on Saturday afternoon and start cracking up some microbrews.  This is especially a recipe for disaster for me.  I have a hard time shutting down my drinking when there is still waking hours ahead.  Stop drinking early afternoon and I'll just fade, so I try to keep it going.  Meaning, come evening, I'm a mess and pass out on the couch at 8-9.  Next day, Sunday, I'm dragging and lately I've been just doing a repeat of Saturday, but this time solo drinking.  It's a really, really bad habit that I haven't been able to get a handle on.  I want to be present for my friends and family, and this isn't allowing it.

Drinking was my identity. I went back to college (after dropping out as a sophomore at age 19 so I could party more) to study biology in order to pursue a career as a brewer. I have barley and hops tattooed on my forearm. New friends were always astonished at my capacity to drink them under the table. Old friends knew.

The problematic drinking crept up on me. There is an African proverb: ""Don't look where you fell, look where you stumbled."" I was obsessing about where I fell, where alcohol's severe troubles began. Looking back further, though, I see my stumbles were plenty--and always chalked up to the recklessness of youth, if not completely forgotten due to a blackout. I let pandemic stress and isolation make everything worse.

Three hundred sixty-six days ago, my dishonesty to myself and my wife came to a head. The A-Word was uttered for the first time. The next few days were spent with clenched teeth and fists, sweating it out. Meetings were attended. Support was garnered from expected (and unexpected) sources. 

You helped me. Yes, you. When I didn't even *want* to do it for myself anymore, you were there to hear me, to share your stories and struggles. The knowledge that You Will Not Drink With Me Today. I knew there were times when you neded to hear what was on my mind, so I posted here.

2021-11-02 09:09:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ql3up5/urge_surfing_last_night/,Urge surfing last night,"Urge surfing can be dangerous, but ultimately, in my practice, it is vital to developing the ability to experience the urge to drink or act unskillfully and not act on that urge.  I first heard about the term while listening to the Happiness Lab podcast episode ""You can't always want what you like"".  The practice is about not turning away from the urge when it arises and instead allowing yourself to experience it while not acting on it.  


There are times when I could never do this practice.  If I am around people drinking for example, I find it more skillful to redirect my attention away from the urge, but last night, I was home with the family and had no way of getting a drink, so it was a safe time to surf.    


It started with the thought that it was a stressful and long day and I just wanted to relax.  Then, just watching the football game didn't feel enough, I hadn't named the craving yet, I just felt restless and dissatisfied with the moment.  That's when my radar pinged and I saw where my mind was actually heading.  ""Football and beer just go together..."".  The urge.  

With practice, I have found that I can experience this thought, even when it comes on strong, as just a thought arising in a mind that has been conditioned into a pattern.  I have a story about what watching football means that I learned by growing up in a family that drank and watched football.  I then enacted that same story in my own life for years.  These thoughts now also arise along with the urge: ""This is a pattern that I want to change. It didn't serve me and I am not enacting it.""

From there, the experience becomes a mindfulness practice of feeling the urge like a tug on my sleeve.  It is real and a part of me and at the same time impersonal.  It is a conditioned response to the stimulus of an evening watching football.  Staying with the urge allows me to feel how powerful it is and how that changes.  It came on slowly, then grew into an urge to get my keys and go get something, and then, it was just an urge like an urge to scratch my arm, a tug with no more force than any other thought.  And then, it passed and I was just watching football, enjoying the game (ok, that's a lie, the Chiefs sucked and barely won) and enjoying that I didn't drink that day.

My friends are very supportive and my wife has been incredible as well. There are ups and downs in my personal life and also my hobby with trading, one constant has always been this sort of recurring dream/nightmare that would always seem to crop up. 

Used to have all different hiding spots, stashes for hard liquor and whatnot. In the garage, in the shed, under the desk, inside a folded up winter jacket in the middle of summer, inside folded up shorts in the middle of winter, bottle hidden inside the recycle bin outside etc. I went through great lengths at that time and am glad I found better use of my energy 

My brain has recently started to feel a lot less pickled (I was initially worried the memory issues would be permanent) and since the start of quitting, my recurring dream was always about this one hiding spot. It’s a spot I never did actually use, but had thought about using. I had this (I thought) genius idea of hiding vodka inside a giant bottle of vinegar, in line behind another already open bottle of vinegar so it would be a length of time to replace the dupe.  I wound up quitting before ever doing that

In the dream I would wake up super early, get blackout from the hidden secret vinegar bottle and then wake up IRL wracked in guilt and have a weird off-center day or multiple days til I shake it off

This time the same dream setup was there, but I poured the vinegar shots into this spooky skeleton cup (it was always a shot glass before) and then my brain was like…. Vinegar…. Pickled brain?? Spooky skeleton… death? - wait a second this is all literally an analogy about choosing to pickle my brain and go on a path towards a sooner death and lucidly woke up without the usual guilt 

It’s great to know IRL I chose the better timeline

I think Halloween helped this year🎃

At first it was alright, but it really kicked my depression into overdrive slowly after a couple of weeks. While I didn't drink the entire time, I definitely let it consume me, and I wasn't working on my sobriety.

  


I was able to finally talk to me therapist about it a couple of weeks ago, and that helped a lot. Plus, I finally got another job. It's a good job, with hard work, and a good schedule. One thing I have learned over these past couple of months is how much I took a solid schedule for granted, and how important it was to my mental health and my sobriety.

  


I'm going to be doing my best to get back in the habit of being on here daily so that I'm not just ""not drinking"" but I can actually work towards the sobriety that I want.

Gives me a LOT of statistical data.  Every time I take a shot, I make a hashmark on a scrap piece off paper.  Later, I transfer it to my calendar.

Why don't I write the total shots the day after?  Oh, I tried that at first.  Then one morning I realized I couldn't remember whether I had 12 or 13 shots.  That clued me in that I really did have a problem.

When I first started doing this, I was shocked at myself.  I wasn't at full daily-drinking yet, but I thought ""Oh, I'm not that bad.""  Then I saw the numbers and just how frequently I was drinking, and how much.

I've since added tracking my dry streak daily with roman numerals\*.  If it's a day I, then it's like a personal pledge to TRY to not drink.  And if it's a day XL, it's STILL a pledge to not drink that day.  Just a small habit to remind myself to stay vigilant. 

This does two things for me.  If it's a wet streak, I can see just how bad I've gotten.  And I can see my previous successes.  To feel ""Yeah, I did that.  -I- did that.""  


If it's a dry streak, seeing my current success feels nice.  And looking back on all those gallons of vodka I consumed is a good reminder to NOT be lured by the first drink.

And when I stop tracking?  I couldn't tell you how bad I got.  I literally can't - no records.

Anyway, it's not some big solution, but it is something that helps me.

An entire year without a drink. In three days, I will turn 30 years old and boy did I not expect to have this accomplishment by then. When I would bargain with myself in the late drunken evening and sluggish hungover morning, I’d always say to myself that if I was going to stop, I would do it when I turned 30. Yet here I am, nerdy, dirty, and almost a teetotaling thirty. 

Here’s a quick list of everything I missed out on this year:

hangovers

anxiety over what I said while drunk

anxiety over what I couldn’t remember due to being drunk

disgust with myself 

empty beer cans littering the floor

shame as I dumped a bin full of cans into the recycling bin

feeling panic when I couldn’t recall simple terms

worry about the state of my liver

fear that I would die before my parents due to my actions 

reckless bodily endangerment

terror at the thought of what I would look like in ten years if something didn’t change

feeling stupid, unfunny, boring

picking fights with my partner

friendships that don’t support or fulfill me



Here’s what helped:
fear of my own mortality

therapy

therapy

therapy

group therapy

connecting with other sober folks

this subreddit and the lovely community y’all have built

antidepressant medication 

some quit lit, This Naked Mind was alright but Infinite Jest has been my lifeline 

telling no one my intentions for the first four months. I had a bad habit of succeeding in sober months until I started to tell people. Some contrarian part of me would insist on doing the exact opposite of what I wanted as soon as there was someone to potentially hold me accountable. Some folks knew I wasn’t drinking but it was because I kept saying it was due to recovering from Covid

the steady and slow lifting of the alcohol soaked curtain that slowed my mind

a sense of accomplishment

not tracking days, but occasionally marking the months

a gift at six months: my first new camera lens in ten years, a lovely macro lens

a gift at one year: a new camera body
 

What I have gained:
clarity of purpose, I can see myself and the steps I need to take to continue my growth

better impulse control

more financial stability and security

my wits

stronger connections with friends and family

the capacity to take better care of myself

better poops

increased productivity

less fear of vulnerability

willingness to admit my failings

openness to new experiences 

love for myself

forgiveness for myself

trust in myself


Now for the big finale  Last night, after four years and four months together, I reached the conclusion that I need to end my current relationship.

Now comes a period of painful disentanglement where I will remain sober while

I buy container of cookies from the store: I eat all of them in a single sitting 

I buy a bottle of vodka: I drink it all in a single night

In every other part of my life I understand this dynamic and try to use it to my advantage. I try to find work that is stimulating. I don't buy junk food when I grocery shop. I try to find hobbies that are healthy and stimulating. 

But when it comes to booze, I used to keep making decisions as if I was this extremely moderate self-controlled person that I'm just not. It didn't even take long for the plans to fail. Most times my moderation didn't even make it past the first drink! 

Some people can have a huge jar of candy on their desk at work and not touch it for months. That isn't me. 

When my model for engaging with alcohol didn't consider my fundamental personality, I had a miserable time. Accepting that I'm not the kind of guy that should drink, and being okay with that has helped so much. 

I used to think that the answer was trying to overcome my very nature, like trying to break a wild stallion. Instead of just figuring out how to healthily be who I am.

I haven’t been here in a while, but I thought it would be good to pop in. This place was integral to my early sobriety, so I feel like I owe this wonderful community a post. 3 years came and went last week and I almost missed it. It’s funny how that first year I spent weeks leading up to my sober date waiting to have one year and two years later I damn near missed the date. This is the life I am blessed with now. One where alcohol is small and insignificant. I don’t miss it, I don’t romanticize it, I see it for what it was. A crutch that was killing me and burning down my life. 

The past three years have been filled with awesome new experiences and challenges. Not because sobriety is a magic cure all, but because being sober has given me the courage to get outside my comfort zone. If all I did was stop drinking and nothing else, I think I’d have a different story to tell. Sobriety allowed me to get to work on myself.

I won’t go on and on, but if you need to hear this today. You can stop. You can have a beautiful life. You don’t have to believe me, but it’s true.  Everyone  here with any meaningful sobriety knows that you are capable of it. We all want this for you. So go get it! IWNDWYT",9

Last few times I managed to catch myself at one drink: felt like a sign of progress. Not yesterday: yesterday was a proper nosedive off the wagon. So here I am again: feel like crap, feel like a fool, and feel like I can’t trust my own brain.

Posting mostly for accountability. Publicly admitting the problem helps.

But also hoping there’s any ideas or insights about what’s happening here, and how to break the cycle—how to prevent or break the “fugues.” In quotes because I know it’s not a real fugue. It’s more like I get these fiery worms crawling around my brain that suddenly start screaming for alcohol so loud I can barely hear myself think.

I have alarms that remind me to HALT—super useful. I now take circuitous routes to avoid places to buy booze. I read here every day, which has yielded many useful insight—and a powerful antidote to feeling so alone. If you have insights or ideas how I can manage this particular cycle, I’ll try it.

A little info - 

I don’t drink much, maybe 2-4 beers a day, but it’s always consistent.  There are a few reasons why I’m concerned with this.  My family has a history of addiction and there were some rough times in my life growing up, and I swore up and down that I wouldn’t drink or do anything of the like to the level that it would destroy my life.  I couldn’t understand the dependence factor.  I’m also trying to quit for my health, including nicotine, because I have children now and I want to be as healthy as I can be both to keep up with them and to live a long and fruitful life.  The problem is, I can’t seem to put the alcohol down and I drink most times almost unconsciously.

It’s like a comfort at the end of a hard day, working a physical job and being a laborer.  What I’m really concerned with is this addiction developing into something much worse because I’m starting to see patterns in myself that I’ve seen in my own family.  I see those patterns but I still continue to drink, as if it won’t be me and I can’t find anything to stay consistent long term.  

TLDR: 
How do I drop the drink and stop myself from becoming a full blown addict, and why do I do it without even thinking?",6

My appetite is still lost to be honest and it’s getting quite a bit of attention from people around me. It’s difficult to explain that I have no appetite because I’m concentrating on not drinking. I’d lost a lot of weight by prioritising alcohol instead of food when I was drinking so now I can imagine to everyone it just seems like I don’t eat haha … only a little but I do (working on it).

The last 2 days have been a little easier as I took myself to a family members to “catch up and stay over” who have no clue of my drinking habits and basically don’t drink themselves so living by their routine has really helped and meant that I’ve not really thought about drinking at all. I am concerned for when I go back to my own place as I’d like replicate this environment there.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

The Taboo

Good morning my fellow sobernauts, thank you for joining me for another 24 hours of alcohol free living.

I’d like to raise a subject today that I suspect many of us confront at some time or another, but that often makes people very uncomfortable to hear about. So uncomfortable in fact, that they often don’t know what to say, and so they ignore it or try to laugh it off. In the “getting sober/recovery” community though, thankfully, it’s recognised and addressed - we include it in one of our basic sobriety tools. 

It’s something that can touch anyone of any age, in any circumstance; it’s draining and exhausting and negatively affects both physical and mental health, but it’s like a taboo when it comes to admitting it. I’ve often felt myself almost ashamed of saying it, as if it signals some kind of hideous deficit in me personally, and I wonder if I am doing the right thing by talking about it now. It’s portrayed by society as a bit pathetic, a bit sad and desperate, for reasons that are quite mystifying when you look at it rationally, but unfortunately this results in people feeling they should stay silent about it. 

It is very, very common amongst people with an alcohol abuse issue, which drives further alcohol consumption in an effort to subdue it, and so the circle of this taboo continues.

I’m talking about feeling lonely. In an age where casual conversation includes any number of shocking and provocative subjects,  one of the most undesirable of all is loneliness. 

Am I an object of pity if I admit to sometimes feeling horribly lonely? I know logically that it makes no difference if I am single or with a partner, if I am physically by myself or in a crowd, if I am young, or old, or rich, or poor, if I have children or not, if I have a job or am unemployed - anyone can feel lonely. That sense of disconnection from others, that feeling of “otherness” and not quite being really understood; it’s why I’m so delighted when I see signs that someone “gets me”, that I’ve connected with another human being and they’ve identified with my thoughts and feelings, even just for a moment. 

There’s nothing pitiable or wrong about feeling lonely. It is the essence of the human condition. **It’s what I do about it that is the determiner.**  I used to drink a lot of alcohol to try and drown it out. But it was, of course, never enough. And like all the uncomfortable feelings that I am learning to manage in healthier ways, I am working on sometimes feeling lonely and not being afraid or embarrassed to express that. Because I do know that acknowledging when I am lonely, is better for me than drinking 2 beers, 2 bottles of wine and a chaser, and pretending I’m not. 

Currently, I feel a bit lonely. It will pass - like all the other unpleasant feelings I no longer squash down with blackouts, I can ride it out. And to anyone else out there today feeling the same, you might be lonely, but you’re not *alone* experiencing that.

HALT (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired) has been a useful sobriety tool for many years, a way to quickly check the basic necessities are being met, at a time when cravings feel overwhelming. But that was pre-pandemic, and human contact was a lot easier and more accessible then. The world has changed. How do you combat feeling lonely now? What works for you? Are there regular habits you’ve developed instead of drinking? What helps? What doesn’t? 

I will not drink with you today.",356

I wanted to be a good role model to her and that was the driving force behind the change. I figured while I was doing something so fundamentally life changing, it was a good chance to throw in a couple of other solid life goals at the same time. I didn’t set my sights on anything too lofty, just getting some basic exercise, staying in touch with my family better, and taking care of my personal finances a little. This is when something strange happened. I joined r/fire and r/frugal and started to invest in my 401k plan and some other minor investments also as suggest by many members. This had a pleasant effect of watching the money I saved from not drinking grow, but it also gave me something to really throw my effort into and take my focus off drinking! I don’t know if I’d say it has become an obsession at this point, but it has definitely helped me to replace drinking with something positive and productive. It’s probably not for everyone, but I thought it was worth putting out there in case anyone is looking to fill the void left by alcohol and thinks this might work for them.

I've been a heavy beer drinker for over 20 years. In the past 10 years or so I've been drinking at least 6 beers per night and more on weekends or special occasions. I've been trying to moderate or quit pretty much continuously for the past 5 or so years and, like many people, haven't been able to stick with it. In recent months I've been taking more risks (driving locally over the limit), prioritizing drinking over responsibilities, started drinking at lunchtime (work from home) which then means the rest of the afternoon is a write off for getting any work done and had a decent amount of health anxiety about what my drinking is doing to my body. I recently got the all-clear for my health from my doctor, but it's only a matter of time until my drinking, and the unhealthy lifestyle in general that goes with it, catches up with me. 

Last weekend I was out for dinner and had already gone 1 day without a drink. I really wanted a beer at dinner, but also didn't want to lose my second day of sobriety. I was in great company that I am completely comfortable with and can spend time with without using alcohol as a social lubricant but knew that despite my strongest amount of willpower I would still order a beer once I sat at the table. Yes, I was setting myself up for failure, but I was also being a realist. When I saw NA beer on the menu I thought I'd give it a go. After all, if I didn't like it I could just order my usual instead. Surprise surprise! It actually tasted good. So good in fact that I managed to down 6 over dinner. If it had been alcoholic beer, my partner would have been giving me filthy looks all night as I got drunker and drunker. The drive home would have been filled with a frosty silence and I would then have had to deal with the fallout we all know all too well from drinking too much.  

I had a function to go to the next day so I brought a box of the NA beer I was drinking the night before. I didn't know the people at this function and would usually drink a lot of beer as a way to feel more at ease. However, as at ease as alcohol might have made me feel, I would also have been obnoxious, loud, and inappropriate and left completely the wrong impression of who I am on these people that I will see more of in the future. Instead, I drank that NA beer like a dehydrated camel and was on my most charming best behavior. I went to bed that night not feeling disgusted or disappointed or embarrassed. It was a nice feeling. 

Today is day 5 sober for me. I haven't had this many days in a row for a long time, let alone without a hangover (do AF hangover days really event count as an AF day? :-/). So, while NA beer might not be popular on here, it's working for me. I don't know what my longer-term plan is with drinking. At this stage, I'm just taking it one day and one craving at a time.",214

I started to get pain in my sinuses and front of my head. Every day since then has been in pain and I cannot remember a day when I actually felt well.

My doctor ran every test he could. I am perfectly healthy. No infections, no allergies, liver is great, and for that I am grateful after 20 years of heavy drinking. I met with an ENT and he found an osteoma and deviated septum. He doubted either was causing the pain, but after six months of what felt like a permanent sinus infection I decided to have a septoplasty and have the doc cut out the tumor.

Worst decision of my life. It’s been five weeks and I still haven’t regained my sense of smell. My left nostril is worse now then it was before, and the pain hasn’t gone away. The ENT says my nose healed perfectly but I am stuck with the sensation that something is stuck in my nose. Google Empty Nose Syndrome. I was desperate and I feel I made a terrible mistake.

Through all of this I have tried to stay positive. I run 100 miles a month, eat healthy, spend time with my family, maintain a good work-life balance.

I know drinking will not solve any of these problems, but I just want a break from this constant pressure and misery. I know in the morning I will feel like shit, but at this point I know I will already feel like shit anyways.",11
2021-11-01 23:24:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qkva1r/reengaging_with_stopdrinking/,Re-engaging with StopDrinking,"I’m early 40s and been living as an alcoholic since about 30. Drinking to get high, drinking alone, binge drinking. There were rarely consequences, but even when I did something stupid or dangerous, I’d only face my problem for a few days or weeks before drinking again just as before. I still wanted to drink to get high, so it was easy to defend the behavior and decide the fix was to just not make stupid choices when drinking, rather than not to engage in alcohol abuse.

When pandemic hit, I ended up drinking much more, since working from home left me with little structure. Two bottles of wine was not unusual. That’s pretty much where I’ve been since, 8-12 drinks a day.

Well, in June I had my first physical since that increase in consumption, and of course my GGT number is high. They want it at 8-73 U/L, mine was 109. That freaked me out. There are plenty of very hard drinkers among my recent relations, but the ones who are gone have died in their late 60s or 70s from cardiovascular maladies, so it was easy to not worry about immediate health consequences. Now I’m thinking back to the stories you read on here and the stats you see about people dying of liver disease in their 40s or 50s, and serious health problems feel a lot closer.

I’ve tried on and off since then to stop or cut back on my own, or with help from my wife (reading each other chapters from This Naked Mind each night). This has so far failed to have much impact. My wife likes to say I need to reach out for support, and I’m coming around to the wisdom of that. I don’t think I can do this alone. It’s been five years since I didn’t drink for any real length of time—two weeks or a month here and there. I feel utterly unable to do that now. It’s become such an ingrained part of my dysfunctional emotional self support structure that I easily find excuses to drink.

I don’t want to die before my mother, who already lost one child. I don’t want to leave my wife widowed just on the outside of middle age. I don’t want to fail to confront this problem, I want to take it seriously, get help, and change things. So I’m going to re-engage with this group as a first step.

Can’t say IWNDWYT since last night I drank into the early morning hours, but I’ll be back tomorrow to check in on the daily thread.

Being unemployed is making things worse, since I am home and can just be lazy. 

Has this happened to anyone else? I had a blood test a week after I quit drinking and the only things out of norm were liver enzymes. I was drinking really heavily throughout the summer (.5L of Vodka every evening on average), but was managing things like working 60+ hour weeks, so this is a really big bummer for me, as I was hoping to have a really nice uptick in energy levels after a few weeks of being sober.

I am here to tell you that if you are considering relapsing because you just don’t see the point of it because it is so difficult, please do reconsider.

I see so many posts of those who are in the first three months really struggling. That was a really rough three months for me, personally. I had to hang on for 6 1/2 months until my spouse joined me on my journey and THAT was really, really hard since we were big time drinkers for years.  I cried myself to sleep so many nights.  I just felt that there had to be something better, and there was.

When I was drinking, I had only two thoughts in my mind when I wasn’t drunk: 1. I really need to stop drinking 2. I can’t wait until I can drink again. Over and over and over for YEARS.  I knew it was insane but I couldn’t shake it. I couldn’t stop. It felt just too good and I wasn’t hurting anyone, right?

I know now without a doubt those months of pain was my brain recovering to me always hitting the “reward” button in my brain. Where did my reward go? Now all I feel is pain. That is, until your brain starts to readjust.

I was addicted to something, that is all. No stupid seltzer commercial will convince me that shit is ok.

Now my reward center is back and I now want to do things just for fun.  Puzzles, video games, yoga, talking on the phone, cooking.  *I feel like my life has meaning again and it didn’t feel that way when I was drinking.* I also feel like myself. I didn’t feel like myself for a long time and I guess that happens when you replace all the things you once loved with a dull buzz every night.

I was so excited for the physical gains in the beginning, but by the time they came, I almost didn’t care when I got compliments. I just wanted to be myself again and that feeling far surpasses any vain reason I had to get sober.

If you are looking to get off of the hamster wheel, I highly recommend starting by doing something for yourself that you will really enjoy. 

Remind yourself you deserve REAL rewards and love that are not an addictive substance.",90

A year without making an absolute fool out of myself with my drunken antics 

A year of trying to work on myself so I can be the 

That and the fact that I couldn’t believe how much money I was able to save and invest. I never realized how much money I was actually spending on alcohol back when I was drinking. Back then paying $50 for a bottle seemed like a good ideas the time, or going out to a bar and dropping another $50-$100. Now I don’t even buy anything at the grocery store that’s not on sale or at least a decent price. 

The crazy thing is that sobriety gives you everything alcohol promises you. I thought when I drank I became more funny, more intelligent and more confident. In actuality all those things were already inside of me, I just couldn’t see them at the time

If anything alcohol did the opposite to me. I became sloppy, I became rude and inconsiderate. I started to only care about how or who is was going to drink with next. Alcohol lied to me. 

It lied to me that I needed it to have a good time with friends. It lied to me that I needed it to talk to a pretty girl. It lied to me that it was my friend.

Now I think of alcohol as an old, toxic ex-friend; I think of them frequently and I care about them, but it's best for my wellbeing not to interact with them anymore. The feelings aren't so sharp, they're just melancholic and pitiful. But the feelings that recovery give me are light and full of joy. Recovery gave me my life back.

I really can't believe I've made it this far, and that it's gone by so quickly. I know it's the most cheesy line in the history of motivational speaking, but I believe it in my heart that if I was able to pull the will to be sober from my willpower, it is possible for anyone. I wasn't capable of it until I finally was. Sometimes when it's dark, it's because you're just a little seed, planted and waiting for what you need to sprout.

No more NAs and time to start eating better. 

To our brand new friends: NA beer is great! I’d bring it to parties, no one noticed I wasn’t drinking, having it at home tricked my brain early on at first and reduced cravings. This is not an anti-NA beer post. Use that crutch if you need it, I’m not sure if I’d have made it to 4 months without it!

I don't know if this is the right place to be inquiring about symptoms, but if im blabbing in the wrong place, please direct me to the right one. 

I would say I have a pretty decent eye for an alcoholic. My father is one, and was damn good at hiding it. Therefore, I usually say to myself that I can identify one from a mile away. However, my buddy (19 Y/O) has made me question what I know. 

Every single week end, like clock-work, this guy drinks a 5th of whisky on Friday, and a 5th on Saturday. These are just the days that I KNOW he drinks. Sometimes he drinks more than that but NEVER less. For example, this weekend he drank a whole 5th of cheap-shit whisky and then got a 12 pack and crushed the whole thing. As a 19 year-old myself, I couldn't help but gawk and laugh a bit. However, when the reality hits me, I come to the conclusion that this is a ridiculous amount, especially for someone that young. Also, these 5th drinking sessions are 90% of the time by himself. Just him, sitting in his barracks room drinking a 5th. When drinking alone he does not get into to much trouble. 

However, up to this point I have failed to mention what happens when we go out with this man. 

\-Making fun of one of my buddies family friends for being gay (to his face), Being uncontrollable in club situations (I.E running away never to be seen for the rest of the night), Getting tattoos, Sexually harassing/possibly assaulting women, losing his wallet with sensitive government materials in it, Saying dumb shit on social media, and the list goes on. And after doing all this shit he still wont admit that he has an issue/wont ever turn into one. He believes it to be humorous and tries to play the tough guy role and says ""he doesn't give a fuck""

After writing this it made me take a more objective look at it. It makes me not want to be there for him. However, I don't give a fuck hes a pretty decent guy when he's sober.

I'm not looking for any of you guys to agree with me on how fucked up/not fucked up this behavior is. I would like to ask for some wisdom/advice on dealing with this situation. Should I take a more auto-pilot approach, or a more hands on. I care about this kid I don't want him to fuck up his life, or make life for his future family hard.

Also, I'm aware that this is not the usual type of ""alcoholism"". Allegedly he doesn't crave it/need it on workdays. Is he more at risk than the average person because he's a binge drinker? Thank you guys for your patience, and sorry about the ramble.",5

I haven't yet got a sponser but am aiming to approach one tommorrow. My drinking led to the end of a 2 and a half year relationship which coincided with my decision to go sober. The relationship should have ended it was toxic and alcohol fuelled and I'm so glad to be out of it. Anyhow the past weekend I finally came out of my teetotal hermit status and went out with friends over three nights. At a party at mine i met a girl and we slept together. It was the first time in my life that I'd slept with a person I wasnt dating sober. In fact i have never even kissed a girl for the first time sober. This was a revelation to me. That i can feel sexy, confident, vulnerable without the crutch of alcohol. I'd never thought it possible for me. But I know AA preeches abstinence in the early days. And with a sober mind i can see how this could make my sobriety somewhat complicated, perhaps even threaten it.

I wondered what thoughts were on sex in the early days of sobreity. Can the two go hand in hand? Are the relationships doomed?

Lucky this woman is polyamorous so hopefully that will limit some elements of codependency. but still i would like the advice of those with experience. Can see how pursuing this is like walking a tight rope.",4
2021-11-01 19:37:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/qkqzc1/fireball_whiskey_and_cigarettes/,Fireball Whiskey and Cigarettes,"That was 90% of my diet right there (the other 10% was anything greasy). I was the girl with the shakes who would be at the liquor store right when it opened at 9am...then lie to the person at the register by saying I was always in there because I was always in charge of the booze for parties, or that the reason I had the shakes was because I was quitting smoking. I didn't want to be judged (I'm sure I wasn't fooling anyone though).

Ever wake up in the morning wanting alcohol but you drank every last drop (or so you thought)? There were mornings where I was so desperate that would grab all the empty bottles of Fireball lying around my apartment (there were usually lots since I rarely took down recycling back then) and pour whatever teensy amount was lingering at the bottom of them into a shot glass. Normally I would be able to muster up about an ounce...sometimes slightly more or less. And I would also use this process with the bags of wine inside the boxed wine I would have lying around. I would squeeze out everything I could from the empty bags into a glass. Then I would inflate the bag with my breath for the sips still stuck in the crevices so to really ensure I got every single last drop. It was something to tie me over til the liquor stores opened.

I also used to carry vodka in my purse at all times. Security blanket. I would always buy a bottle of Powerade on my way to work, empty half of it into the bathroom sink or toilet when I got there, and filled the other half with vodka. I would drink that throughout my shift, then hit the wine and Fireball at night til I passed out. I chose vodka for work because they say it’s the most odourless. Again, I’m sure I wasn’t fooling anyone.

It breaks my heart when I think about how much control alcohol had over me. I wore clothes with holes in them because I didn't care. I would wake up surrounded by empty bottles, overflowing ashtrays and garbage of fast food wrappers and half eaten food on the floor. My couch had cigarette burns in it. I had a horrible fruit fly problem. And I was so used to feeling like shit that I completely accepted it and normalized to it. How sad.😔

Maybe what I'm trying to say is that just because you're in deep, it absolutely does not mean you are a lost cause. You can get out. And you don't have to wait til you hit rock bottom to make a change either. I did. I was in the hospital for eight days with liver damage and unsure of my fate. It was horrible. I was so far gone into my dependency that I literally almost died for alcohol. I'm actually a little teary-eyed as I write that because, well, it's sad.  And I was lucky. You might not be so lucky. Just because you're young or have no other health issues does not mean you are invincible. But the only way to change is to want it. You have to want to be sober more than you want to be drunk. You have to go to the lengths for your sobriety that you go for your drinking. This is the perfect time to write yourself a new story. Only you can control your actions. Don't let that fact scare you, let it empower you. You are sooooo much stronger than you think. We all are. It's a new month people, time to get a head start on the New Year! Go into 2022 with a couple months under your belt so you can kick ass even harder when January 1st arrives! Get excited to change your life! You owe it to yourself to do this! You deserve a better life! You are worthy of a better life! Acknowledge that. Because if you're like I was and have forgotten what it feels like to feel good, I'm here to tell you that it feels so fucking good to feel good! So get to work! And wishing you all a healthy and sober November and more!💕",513

I know there are some people who can and all the power to them, but im not one of em.

I'll start with a little backstory. I quit my job at a restaurant last month, for a lot of reasons, but one of them was definitely drinking. It was so easy to have a couple beers after work, free or cheap, and then because I was in the mood it would be grabbing a six pack or a couple tall boys on the way home. 

So I picked up a glory shift this Saturday at the restaurant,  it was a fun night and it was good to see my friends/coworkers. After the shift i had a beer, of course, it was so easy. Then another right before I left.

On the way home I was arguing with myself in my head, as I'm sure many of you have before. 

More beer! 
No ProfessorSMASH,  you don't need more!
Yes more beer!
No!
How about just 1? Maybe 2 tall boys?

I argued until I was 10 meters from the intersection. Left for beer, right for home.

This is where I got lucky, and a little bit proud of myself. I was lucky I was quite exhausted, and I was proud because I switched lanes at the last second. Once I got home I sat in my parked car for a good 5 minutes. I kept thinking about starting my car and going back out, but like I said I was exhausted. I went inside, brushed my teeth and hopped in bed before I had time to change my mind.

I got lucky. I could have easily went for more beers if I wasn't so tired or if I didn't make that split second decision. I spend a lot of nights over the years not being lucky like that. Spending an extra 10-15$ a night, staying up late, waking up feeling like trash.

Anyways, just wanted to share with you all. If I ever work there again I'm going to do my best to not have a beer after work, because it is never just one beer for me. Its always more, and most of the time its lots more.

Thanks for listening, and IWNDWYT :)",18

(TL;DR: at the end)
-----

I don’t mean that I hurt her or yell, or scream, or even berate her. I’m actually a really sweet drunk: cuddly, silly, that sort of thing. 

But I am deceptive as all fuck. 

And sometimes, I think getting into a sober argument is nowhere near as shitty as, oh, say hiding a half-full glass of vodka and coke in the sink among a bunch of other half-full glasses, and keeping a straw in my pocket so that she’s not around, I can take a sip without glasses clinking together. 

It got really bad this year. I’ve always been a pretty heavy drinker. Started pretty late — 20 — and I’d go to parties. Get drunk with friends. Blacked out a few times. But I was a kid, and I didn’t really have access to booze (or money for it).

That changed when I got a job out of college.

Soon, I was throwing back two or three 40s a day. Downing spiced rum from the bottle. You can imagine. As the years went on, I'd get worse and worse. I'd take lunchbreaks to speed home and chug a Steel Reserve. I'd keep a flask in my backpack that I'd refill while I was there and get pretty fucked up at work. I eventually got better jobs that paid more — and more money meant more booze. This went on for a while. 

Then I met my fiancée. At the time, she didn't know exactly how bad my habit was.

She was kind of a hippie-ish, preppy-ish woman. The goodie-two-shoes type. When I was with her, I didn't NEED alcohol (though I did want it — and obviously still drank from time to time). But that time to time became less and less. When she was around, I brewed kombucha. I made fucking vegan smoothies, for fuck's sake. 

Then she tasted one of the old, left-over-from-some-dumb-party bottles of MD 20/20, or some garbage wine I kept in the back of the fridge. And shit changed. Fast.

We drank together almost every night. I was her first black-out experience. Her first hanging over a futon, vomiting orange-colored shit into a Shop-Rite bag. 

This traditional of (mostly) nightly drinking went on for a while. Then we moved into a nicer apartment. Then we both started gaining weight. Then we both started struggling with our mental health. And once more, we stopped drinking. Or, rather, SHE stopped. I kept a-chuggin'. Although, I WAS able to moderate for a while, and even stop drinking for a month or so while I let my meds take hold. I got into healthier foods and fitness. I exercised every day for a month. 

It didn't last.

That's when the deceptive shit started. It was already pretty bad. 

Then COVID hit.

And it was WAAAAAY goddamm bad. 

I gained all the weight I lost back — around 25 lbs.

I ordered from a local liquor delivery place twice a week. Maaaybe typically over $100 a pop. I asked if she wanted something, and, yeah, she occasionally wanted a nice bottle of wine. OK, got it. Then MY haul: four Steel Reserve 40s, a Captain Morgan Spiced Rum (100 proof of course), a bottle of Platinum vodka, some Jim Beam, and, finally, a second, smaller bottle of vodka that I kept in a basket under my desk.

She never knew — not even close — how much I fuckin' drank. She'd sip her wine, I'd pretend to wash the dishes, putting the water at its absolute loudest to drown out the noise of me pouring a glass of vodka and seltzer (gotta watch those calories! amirite!). I'd pull the, ""Hey babe, don't get scared! There's a lot of crap in the garbage disposal, so it might get pretty loud."" Yeah, loud enough to cover the sound of a freaking tall boy's cap popping. 

And so it went on and on and on. These days, I stick to the vodka and seltzer. Or, rather, I stuck to them. I typically start drinking at around 8:00 AM and keep on keepin' on for a total of around 7 drinks a day. Last night, I had my usual. And I woke up feeling like absolute horseshit. It felt like a withdrawal (never really gone through one before, weirdly). The chills. Underneath three blankets, I felt like I was on an expedition to the damn North Pole. Night sweats. Insomnia (the night before). Tried to take a nap before. No such luck.

I threw up twice today. One bowl was filled with dark-ass red wine. The other was straight up plain-ass water (I was trying to hydrate extra on account of the shitty feeling). I decided, nah, this ain't worth it for damn sure. I can't do this anymore. Not for me. Not for her. Not for our future family. 

It could just be a little stomach flu — all the same shitty symptoms, actually. I'll find out on Saturday. But this was a wake-up call. 

I have a doctor's appointment for something unrelated (probably... maybe?... high blood  pressure... so probably related) on Saturday. I've read online that these situations sometimes get better by day 6. My last drink was (well, this afternoon, and it was weak as hell — but that was to try to start tapering.... which I realize I don't think I can do) BASICALLY last night. Around 22 hours ago. I'm starting to feel better thanks to some CBD gummies and Xanax. But I fear what the next few days will bring (don't wanna hallucinate any friggin' babies crawling on the ceiling!).

I can't guarantee I can pull this off and quit forever. Maybe I'll jump back into a bottle a month from now. A week from now. Maybe I'll learn to moderate again: one or two glasses, five days a week. 

But fuck, if I want to try. The hardest part is going to knowing where all the bottles are hidden and keeping my damn, dirty-old mitts off the cabinet handles.

What's that thing you guys say? 

IWNDWYT

And I won't.

I’ve struggled with drinking for as long as I can remember, probably 15 or 16. I’m not perfect by any means. I even got really drunk and did some stupid things while I wasn’t at the hospital. But when I was at the hospital, she gave me a purpose and meaning. I couldn’t wait to bring her home. She was my entire world. Now it’s been a little over two weeks since she passed and I feel like my family and loved ones are like of course she’s drinking like this again. But I feel very judged because while pregnant and when my daughter was sick, people rallied around. They prayed for her, I talked to family members daily that I hadn’t talked to in years.

Only one this time but the same thing happened.

If you'd asked my friends or family, they would have told you that I liked a drink as much as anyone else, but certainly not enough to cause concern. And to some extent that was the story I told myself too. 

I didn't drink until I was sick—or at least, not often. I didn't drink until I passed out, or fell over. I didn't piss myself, or throw punches. In fact, often my drinking was so innocuous that you probably wouldn't even know that I was drunk. 

I was a happy drinker. A social drinker. The problem was regularity and habit. I drank when I traveled. I drank with dinner. I drank when I visited a market. I drank on weekends away, and after work, for birthdays, weddings, catching up with friends, just because. There was always a reason to drink, because I'd convinced myself I was in love with it. 

I enjoyed fine wine, and old scotch. I masked my relationship with drinking under the veil of passion and culture and interest. I watched YouTube videos about whiskey tasting. I bought rare bottles. I stocked up on wines that I knew would pair well with food. I used every trick in the book to justify my drinking to myself. 

But my relationship with alcohol—my problem—was bubbling quietly under the surface for many years. To the outside observer it was invisible, but I felt it and wrestled with it almost every day.

The problem was that slowly my life had become in service to drinking. 

Every walk in the countryside involved a visit to a pub; every meal, a bottle of wine. My daily routines and plans would have drinking pre-programmed into them. Between drinks, my mental energy was caught up on where and when and what would be drunk next. Or—and here's the part that ultimately motivated me to change—with guilt and shame because deep down, over time I had come to realise that my relationship with alcohol was steadily polluting everything I cared about.

As a younger man I told myself that drinking was simply part of enjoying myself. As time past and my habits solidified, I worked harder to find excuses not to stop, to avoid difficult conversations with myself about the problem I knew was there deep down. There was always a social occasion just around the corner to use as an excuse to keep drinking. Or I told myself that I would slow down next week; I'll cut back once we've finished the last few bottles of wine in the rack. It was easy. 

When I told a friend I was going to stop drinking, he said to me, ""that must be hard, because drinking must feel like a big part of who you are"". He was right. For years I had dressed alcohol up as a part of my character and as something important in my life. And in the process it had overtaken everything that actually mattered—in small ways, like my attention span at work, or big ways like my dwindling energy because I was hungover and couldn't give my best to my kids, or that I would find myself in arguments with my wife because I was drinking and decided to be obnoxious. Drinking had become a cycle: drink out of habit—feel consequences of drinking that I was unhappy with—feel shame—drink more. 

The decision to change took time to reveal itself to me at first, but this year as the idea took root in my mind it became more and more obvious that it was the right answer. Attempts to moderate, or adapt my behaviour failed and only made me feel worse. Changing the narrative—taking drink off the table—made sense to me.

I was lucky. My wife, who had often been a drinking partner, took me seriously when I opened my heart up to her and asked for her support. That conversation was a huge moment, and one I was terrified of. But I had no reason to be. She threw herself into the change with me and has held me accountable, cheered me on and carried me when I've found the going tough. 

But I'm still on a journey. Alcohol took up a lot of room inside me for a long time. I'm working through how it feels to live with that empty space in me where drinking used to be, and slowly fill it with other things. There's more work to do, but I don't regret taking that step.

I want to say thank you to everyone who shares on this sub. Your words have so often helped me to see things as they are, take inspiration and stay strong. You got me started on this journey.

I also want to say that drinking problems come in all shapes and sizes. If you're not happy with the relationship you have with alcohol, then that's enough—no matter how it might look to others. Don't be afraid to make a change. You won't regret it.

Thanks for reading. Love and peace to everyone on their journey. IWNDWYT.",80

Other point of progress has been starting an antidepressant. Now feel kinda invested in my mental health.

It's also made me very conscious of my habit of self medicating.

Any time I pick up a beer I ask myself whether I'm drinking a beer because I feel like it or whether I'm drinking to squash some feeling that I'm trying to repress. If it's an attempt to numb some bad feeling, I now know that it's not safe for me to have even one drink. The most dangerous time to drink IMO js when we're already depressed which is of course when most reach for it. That's when I know now that I need to give the medication a chance to keep me well. So nothing at all.

Today was a shitty day in my life. I realised that I owe more tax than I had envisioned which just adds to the stress I'm already feeling about personal finances.

My wife encouraged me to join her after work for a couple of drinks. Honestly the thought appealed to me. And then I realized that doing so would be repeating an old habit I've gotten out of. Numbing pain with alcohol. So I tabled the alternative suggestion that we spend the night in watching Netflix. No alcohol allowed.

Another moment of progress.",9

For two years, I drank a fifth of liquor everyday, normally jack or some kind of whiskey. Got fired from a job, got cheated on, became insanely depressed, drank even more if possible, almost lost some great friends, and so the story goes. 

New job fell in my lap about 7-8 months ago. A good job. I work from home, the pay is good enough, and my bosses are all nice and understanding people who, have been very patient with all of my ""sick days"" as I recover from intermittent binging. 

Maybe they're aware, maybe they've seen it before. Doesn't matter to me, their patience is enough for me to appreciate the job and try hard to be better. 

Anyways, I have started to be able to nail down a week of sobriety on what I would consider ""regular"" intervals. 5-7 days on water and coffee, then a slip up that lasts a day or two at most, then 5-7 more days. I've been here for... Let's say 2 months I think? ""Days"" of sobriety isn't really a thing to me anymore, and I'm happy about that. We're pushing weeks. 

I'm able to sit on a call with some friends and catch up now. Have some laughs. They're even starting to notice from time to time. 

At work, I'm performing very, very well. Even got a semi-promotion. I've begun getting ""exceeds expectations"" on our little performance reviews, and am steadily getting better and quicker at what I do. My boss has called me multiple times to give a pat on the back, say I'm doing a great job, and they look forward to where I end up. I like that guy lol. And it feels good to be moving.. forward I guess? 

My point is, I guess, it would be easy to get lost in the slip ups. I had a quite moment at work, long enough to write this all up, and I guess I just realized how much better things are right now that a year ago, when I was losing my job. I think I'm out of or nearing out of the fog of years of steady drunkness. Yes, emotions are coming back. Feelings of being anxious, sad, happy, tired, and so on are back. 

I think that's the point really. I'm feeling things again. When I'm sad or anxious is easy to think ""well life is still hell"" and maybe it is, but at least I can feel it. It's not a fog into a blur into a blackout into another fog. I'm actually ""awake"" for what seem like extended periods of time. It's nice I think, and I just wanted to say that to the folks who have helped me get this far. Thank you for your advice, continued support, patience, and honestly, genuine love human to human. This is a great place full of great people, and I couldn't be happier to be part of it.",25

I started comparing my life to everyone else’s and concluded that mine was definitely smaller and more pathetic. I started to feel the way I did in active addiction. Lonely, sad, invisible. I woke up the next day, spent most of the day in bed, but then I got dinner with my aunt. Still felt kinda sad but less so. Today I woke up earlier, had therapy and did some chores. Left the house for some appointments. I reached out to friends and my sponsor. I was honest about feeling sad. I don’t feel 100% BUT the difference between active alcoholic me and current me is that my days today are brand new days. I’m not hungover from the day before. I’m not drinking hair of the dog.

A) go and leave spontaneously 
B) hang with different random people everytime

Are their any similar activities that fulfill those two requirements? 

I feel like EVERYTHING as an adult is pre-planned with invite lists. 

A big part of why I like the bar is there are no expectations, obligations or stress over timetables like we have at work and everything else going on as adults.  

I know there are plenty of things to do besides drink, but it feels like they all involve signing up for something organized or you just have to do an activity by yourself (which is fine just dont want to do that always) 

Anyone have suggestions?

EDIT: While appreciative of the suggestions, activities that revolve around talking about alcohol addiction or avoiding alcohol are not what I'm looking for. I just want natural spontaneous adult activities that dont revolve around alcohol (whether it be using it or talking about avoiding using it). The answer may be nothing like that really exists yet, unfortunately. I just am fielding for ideas in case others have found answers.",8

I don't have a physical addiction but my current situation enabled me to engage in consistent ""frat style"" binge drinking - some weeks having 10+ drinks on thurs night, fri night, sat day, sat night, then sunday. Still very functional but regardless I want to reset my relationship with booze, give the body/mind a break, and save some money. I'm a highly social person who has trouble saying no to anything, much less a good time with friends. But my friends binge drink and I'm good at it (lol). I like weed occasionally but in general am not a ""sit on the couch and watch tv/movies all night"" guy. I dont play video games and try to limit screen time. I read here and there. Overall, I'm just an active person.. but unfortunately that excess energy usually goes to partying. For those who have sobered up, how do you spend your ""weekends in?"" It always fascinates me that people can do things for an entire weekend that don't involve drinking then go right back to work on monday (I work remotely which also contributes to going out more). What are some simple hobbies or time killers that aren't necessarily ""productive"" but aren't quite as destructive?

Ideally I'll learn to drink in moderation without having to pass up on outings, but for now I feel stopping cold turkey is the right move.

TL;DR: I am a social and active person looking to give up drinking for a few months. But I'm not good a lazing around on the couch. What does a ""weekend in"" look like for those who don't have families, do have friends, and still want the weekends to feel like weekends?

I knew that there was an almost full bottle of wine in the refrigerator, and pounding that after the melatonin and benadryl would put me out quickly, and end those waves of negativity. For now. But there would be tomorrow to deal with. How long am I going to keep kicking this can down the road? How am I going to feel tomorrow, resetting  my counter? Admitting to myself that I failed? I reminded myself of all the reasons I have to stay sober, and all the encouraging things that people have said to me on this subreddit, and with those thoughts in mind I drifted off to sleep, to fight another day.

Anyway, thanks to everyone who has been encouraging. It really helped.",6

I've been wanting to stop drinking for quite some time now. It has become a real problem in my personal and social life. The problem is, I just don't know how to stop for good. The fact that you feel much better after even a day of not drinking makes me want to drink the same freakin day. Its like an endless cycle. My brain cant comprehend that it has to stop for more than a day to see a difference. Idk if im being clear but this is my main problem with stopping drinking. Me and my friend are going to try a whole month for november, but i'm scared i'll relapse (plus my birthday is in november). I know I have to stop, but at the same time I can't imagine my life without alcohol. 

It's crazy cause I stopped smoking a year ago and it wasnt even that tough...

Any advice???? Thank you and yall have a good day!!",6

I am addicted to alcohol. I’ve been binge drinking nightly for over a week, and shit has gotten so fucking dark so fucking fast it’s hard to believe. I woke up at noon today after having two giant IPAs and a pint of fireball to myself on Halloween. Not at a party, but in my house and on the walk too and from the liquor store. I have over an hour of footage I can’t bring myself to watch most of talking about wanted to kill myself while stumbling and falling on the street. Apparently I relapsed on cigarettes as well, considering the new pack of spirits in my pocket and the burn marks on my arm. I can not keep fucking doing this to myself. I’m going to go back inside, get rid of my weed, destroy these fucking cigarettes, and clean up my various wounds. If you have any advice to give it would be greatly appreciated.

I was doing pretty well, feeling pretty incredible. Halloween is my favorite holiday, I made a diy costume (Beetlejuice) that I was pretty proud of and wanted to show off. I decided I would go out to a bar on Saturday, feeling confident that I could moderate my drinking well enough.

Long story short, I blacked out. I vomited everywhere, ultimately ruining my costume (in some odd sort of poetic way). I’m sure I embarrassed myself in many ways. I was absolutely steps away from being in the emergency room. I spent all of yesterday the most hungover I have ever been, still vomiting until I went to bed around 10 pm. 

I am hands down ready to stop drinking. I have struggled with moderation in general my entire life, and I think yesterday it finally clicked for me that having that problem and drinking is a very dangerous combination. I don’t think that “cutting back” is an option for me. I feel so much shame and guilt and regret that I’m sure will take quite some time to subside. Drinking has played such a large part of Halloween for so many years now, I guess I just felt like it wouldn’t be the same without it. I realize now, that would have been a good thing.

Overall, I am really glad that I found this group yesterday. All of the posts I’ve read so far have been really inspiring. I’m excited to join and hopefully move on from this phase of my life. Thanks in advance for allowing me a place to let  all this out. I feel embarrassed talking about this with friends and family at this point.",19

I had someone ask me if I’m doing it to lose weight which hit me the wrong way for some reason.  I’m not overweight, but I definitely rock the dad bod and I found it passively insulting.  The people who know I’ve been on the wagon from the get go are starting to be frustrated with the new me.  My wife and close family seem to have become annoyed by my personality now that they can’t attribute it to me being loaded.  Maybe it’s just me, but it seems like everyone around me is just waiting for the wheels to fall off and for me to go back to the bottle.  Believe me, I have no intention to and I refuse to stay sober out of spite because that is not going to work.  I can only hope that sober me will eventually just become a normal thing.

I knew I was done, I was on my way to rehab. I wasn’t sure if my marriage was going to survive, didn’t know about my job. At that moment I didn’t care. Just a couple of days before, I seriously contemplated if living was worthwhile or not.

Alcohol can bring us to very dark places.

Rehab gave me a edge that I didn’t have in my earlier attempts to moderate or quit. I learned that alcohol addiction is treatable and I gained some tools to help myself cope. AA and other groups really helped me in the next year, building a network of support and shared experience.

This group has been a long term support for me.

My ambition and love of life returned quickly. I shudder to think of what would have become of me if I didn’t keep trying to stop drinking and reach out for support when I was unequal to the task.

I don’t even know what to say, you guys. I used to read people’s 1 year posts and be like, “Psssh. You were inwardly awesome all along, whereas I am an actual piece of shit and could never achieve that.” Well, I’m not a piece of shit BUT I’m also not special. I went to bed sober a bunch of times, here I am, and you can be here too.

For most aspects of my life, if you asked me how ______ is now compared to last year, I’d probably reply that it’s not perfect but it’s better. Relationships, diet, skin, sleep, mental health, etc. Alcohol was the omnipresent muck keeping me stagnant and clouding my vision, and over the years it made my world smaller and smaller until I couldn’t even imagine changing.

Stopping drinking opened up my life in little ways that stacked and expanded upon each other. I decided to try being vegetarian again, which led to trying to go vegan, which has been a fun adventure. I cook a lot now, and I’m not too wasted to actually taste what I’ve made. I used to semi-consciously watch TV every night, but turns out that bores me now. I reignited my love of reading and I’ve read almost thirty books this year!  

To anyone starting out, keep going! Drinking was an act of violence toward myself, and we all deserve better than that.

Lastly, a video! I present to you a chronological record of moments I was fully here for - not drunk or planning my next drink or hungover. I couldn’t have made it this far without you, sobernauts, and I can’t wait to see what the next year brings. IWNDWYT!

This sub! The daily check ins have been so helpful plus knowing I have help in my pocket no matter what feels good.

IG sober accounts! This was huge for me. These accounts helped me eventually find my way to AA. The thing is, there is so much to not like about AA. But seeing it work for a bunch of queer woman really helped me see that it could help me. Some accounts I like:
Worstdaysober 
AsBillMemesIt
DumbSoberBitch
SoberBlackGirlsClub

Finally, AA was a big help for me. I resisted for years and tried so many other options. But nothing worked and I could barely make it 30 days before relapsing.

I'm having trouble figuring out if it's appropriate to wait until next week and go in person again or email her since that's how we've been communicating or what. Part of me wants to text her, but I feel like texting your boss to quit when they're on vacation is probably not the right option. Yay for brain fog plus I still need to get back on my ADHD meds. O\_o

I had myself super ramped up about it both driving out and driving home. Part of me was trying to say I needed a drink to come down. I disagreed with it. Besides, I'm already brain foggy, the hell is a drink going to help with that? It also won't help me process through what I'm sure are fears about doing things Perfectly, needing to be in control of how people see me, and sometimes just not knowing what an appropriate social reaction even is. Also this weird panic I have that I feel like I need every job I've ever had to give me a glowing reference JUST IN CASE everything falls apart, and the feeling that I'm always one wrong word away from the opposite (This is an unrealistic thing, to be clear. Other than occasional callouts my drinking never got in the way of any of my jobs.)

ANYWAY other than fatigue and brain fog things are still getting better day by day. I listened to an audiobook for hours yesterday while doing random chores and I actually remember the plot today. I'm able to do more with my time off and mostly enjoy doing it. I pulled something exercising the other day and instead of forcing myself to keep going, I'm taking a couple days off like you're supposed to.

I feel like I bounced back faster last time I quit, but that actually makes sense. I drank myself into a hole, recovered, and then went back to it for like 5 years. Realistically I'm sure my body isn't going to recover as quickly this time. Plus I'm older now.

This probably sounds negative, but I don't mean it that way. Every day really is a little better than the last and I know I'll get there in time. I wish I hadn't relapsed and made so much more work for myself, but what's done is done and all I can do is move forward. And this time doing the work to really look at what triggers me to drink and finding real solutions.",18

Im having an extra hard time pulling myself out of the rut this time. Tons of guilt, shame, regret, and anxiety. I just used a ton of PTO dealing with Covid and then I had to take Friday off work again since I was so drunk still, so barely any of that left. 

I am completely covered in bruises, some of the worst I’ve had in a while with zero recollection of how or when it happened. I’m guessing i fell onto the side of the tub, but that doesn’t really explain why I’m bruised on both sides of my torso and hips and and all over both legs, including cuts on my ankles. There’s also a broken mug I don’t remember dropping.. wtf happened in my bathroom?? 

I’ve had to change clothes 4 times or so now, how is it possible for legs to sweat so much? I can’t stand the cold sweats though, that and the anxiety are by far the worst. Not to mention a complete lack of energy.

I basically just drank the way I did when my bf broke up with me for a few weeks (due to drinking of course) and I was severely devastated. There was no reason to drink like I did this time. Just complete recklessness. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. Thankfully I work from home today so I can be a bit lazy but at this rate I’ll be hungover all week. I didn’t even celebrate Halloween, just drank to oblivion for nothing. I normally bounce back faster than this but right now I’m just utterly disappointed with myself.

Sure, it feels great! I woke up this morning without crippling anxiety or bloodshot eyes. My energy level is higher. Shit is still stressful in my life, but my emotional reaction to things is much milder.

My dreams are now VIVID. I constantly have dreams about the shitty/embarrassing things i did to my friends, family and myself. But I also have nostalgic dreams. 

It is a scary time though... for me and a lot of us 

In the summer of 2020, I was going through some rough rough shit. But my drinking, at the time was OK. I still had issues but was drinking about 4 drinks every other night. I thought I was making the right steps.

All it took was one too many drinks that sent me on a bender. A two day bender that landed me in the fucking hospital with a DWI. 

During the blackout bender, I decided to drive (around 9AM) to get some food. As I was driving on a two lane road, I briefly remember heading straight into another car on the other side. I vaguely remember seeing the guys screaming face. I swerved and went back into my lane. 

Shortly after, I was pulled over (thank god) I blew a .3 and was so messed up, I tried to jump out of the cop car so they took me to the hospital rather than jail. 

Once I blacked back in, the cops told my parents that if they hadn’t pulled me over, there was an extremely HIGH chance I would have hit another car at full speed this injuring or possibly killing another person (or family) and myself. There were also runners/bikers on the paths right next to the road... I was swerving all over. 

Man, I got fucking lucky. If I hadn’t got pulled over, I could have killed myself and taking a few people with me. 

I would be serving life in prison and my life would be a mess.

THIS is what is keeping me sober. I know that I possibly could moderate my drinking for some time but ALLL it takes is one too many and my life could be over.

I’m grateful to be here! Stay safe !

While I was in the hospital I found out that was due to PAWS(post acute withdrawal syndrome). There is a lot of debate whether or not it's real, because it's still a new idea, but I can attest to it's validity. Before my ""rebirth"", I was drinking at least a fifth of 100 proof rum or vodka a day. Sometimes I would drink half a gallon of everclear 151 a day, and that lasted for most of 2020. I was drinking for 10 years and for 6 years I was abusing painkillers when it was prescribed to me by taking too many and mixing with alcohol.

Last night during trick or treating, my 5 year old niece wanted to ride in the back of the truck as we went house to house through our neighborhood because we didn't want her to walk the whole time. So my job was putting her in the bed of the truck, helping her to get out, and making sure she didn't fall out. The first time I picked her up she said ""Why are your hands shaking so much?"" And this was the conversation that followed. 

""My hands always shake.""

""Why?""

""Because I've made a lot of bad decisions""

Here’s what I took away from it.","I had a problem for maybe fifteen years. What started as me living my life to get wasting with my friends at the weekend, turned to me getting wasted, alone, at the weekend and any other day I didn’t have to be at work. 

I would book holidays just to get drunk and not have to be up the following morning. 

After many attempts to quit, I finally did it in 2019 and I didn’t go back. Life was great. Health-wise, work-wise and family-wise. 

The only issue was parties and social events. I used to love parties and have a great time. Over the last two years I have grown to hate them. Without drink I just don’t want to be there. I hate the loud music, I hate clock watching and trying to stay longer enough so that the host isn’t offended and I hate having drunken people talking to me. 

Some of these events I just cant avoid, especially when it’s family or work. 

Well three weeks ago, while at one of these parties, I caved and got drunk. I had the best night I have had in a long time. I haven’t drank since. 

Previously when I caved, on a quitting streak, I would straight away go back to drinking as often as possible. This time I haven’t done that. I’ve told myself that I have this under control now. I have decided to only drink at events (one a quarter, if that) NEVER at home, ever!

Part of me is happy that I have overcome this and that I can live a normal life similar to most people around me. 

Another part of me worries that this is how it starts and I will slowly lose track of the correct way to do this. 

Anyway, there you go. 

What do you thin? Have I got the wrong mindset? Should I go back to the mindset of NEVER drinking again?",29

""So, if I could take all this science (about addiction) and summarise it into three sentences it would be these. At it’s heart, addiction is a dis-order in the brain’s ability to properly perceive pleasure. Addiction is a hedonic dis-function, it’s a broken pleasure sense. So, in the same way that a blind person cannot perceive light or a deaf person cannot perceive sound, an addict cannot perceive pleasure correctly. And that undermines their ability to make choices. Our capacity for free will, volition, agency whatever you want to call it, rests upon proper processing deeper in the brain. So, if pleasure, or more specifically reward breaks, then what goes next is decision making. You have to have a perfectly functioning reward system if we are going to make decisions that are considerate of past consequences and future consequences and in line with our values. What is at the core of the reward system is dopamine.""

I didn't stop drinking through the help of AA, but through another clinic I was referred to by my GP (I think based on SMART recovery). That process was instrumental in my recovery and—praise God—I haven't relapsed. But now I am seriously considering joining AA. I used to find this sub was helpful enough, and I have really appreciated it, esp at the beginning. But now I'm wondering if I need a bit more help...i have been looking at the 12 Steps, and have been very impressed (and not a little daunted) by steps 4 and 5. Maintaining my sobriety seems to be one thing, but removing the obsession completely seems to be another. Perhaps going through the steps will get me there? Joining AA feels awkward and alien to me, because I wasn't 'saved' through that program, and it's very different to what I'm used to. I am nervous about the intensity and feel shame at the idea of belonging to it (because of the stigma). I know AA isn't very popular on here, but did anyone else start their sobriety by themselves or with SMART (or even this sub) and then later join AA? P.S. I just finished Dr Anna Lembke's 'Dopamine Nation', and she had much to say about the benefits of AA, their emphasis on 'radical honesty', humility, and taking responsibility.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Keeping It Real

Good morning SD and welcome to November, the month that traditionally heralds the colder weather, darker evenings and the run-up to various holiday celebrations for many. Guy Fawkes Night, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve - these festivities bring to mind all the heartwarming and feel-good associations we’ve come to expect: 

smoky bonfires, baked potatoes and flashing fireworks: juicy turkeys, a carpet of golden leaves, cranberry jelly, hot crusty pies: brightly wrapped gifts, blankets of soft, white snow, twinkling fairy lights, inviting houses and the warmth of friends: kisses at midnight, new year resolutions, parties and anticipation….  **and the relentless promotion of a lethally addictive poison that is responsible for the deaths of over three million people worldwide every year.**

This time last year I was sober but still paralysingly depressed and the thought of these celebrations was challenging and triggering. I had read and listened to the book Alcohol Explained by William Porter on continuous repeat for months, and knew I could not go back to drinking anymore. But I didn’t want to be stuck in this psychological  limbo of *imagining* that I still missed something I knew was killing me and didn’t really want. Porter showed me the reality of this poisonous liquid and what it does, physically and mentally, to the human body and brain, and so I took my cue from him.

**I stopped romanticising drinking alcohol and what would happen if I did.** 

I stopped buying into the “it’s necessary to be sociable” bullshit, and paid more attention to the messages being pushed at me by the media and advertising. I began to reframe every lie about alcohol that I read, saw, heard, and say it aloud to myself. 

*”No, it won’t make me seem glamorous and sophisticated, the central wit of a social circle! It’ll make me drunk, unable to control my speech, my movement and sometimes my bodily functions. It’s not the perfect present to give anyone at Christmas, least of all myself! It will make me fucking boring as hell because I’ll be on continual repeat. It won’t ‘calm me down’ or ‘help me relax’, it will perpetuate my anxiety and depression. It won’t make me fun and entertaining. It will make me stink, it will give me diarrhoea, and I will look like a slobbering, unattractive mess of a human. It won’t make me happy. It will rob me of several days to follow and I will have drunk so much that I will be physically ill and wish I could die”.*

Be kind to yourselves as the challenging holiday season approaches. Keep it real my friends. 

I will not drink poison with you today.",607

Well, I'd catch a month or so of sobriety (or a fortnight, or a week, or two days) and then relapse for some reason or another. I felt I had very little safeguards from relapsing, I didn't really understand my own triggers. For the first time (I think ever) my several month sobriety account is accurate.

My boyfriend bought me therapy, and honestly I feel it's been transformative. I'm still an Extremely Sensitive person, and will probably always be a work in progress, but this bit is for sure: progress is being made.

Which... is what makes it harder, sometimes, to stay sober. Because I feel I have a handle on it now, right? I have a double date coming up with my friend this week and afterwards everyone is coming back to the flat for drinks and boardgames. And I have the excuse I want to hand: I'm taking medication that means I can't drink. Obviously, there is no medication. I just can't drink.

And I'm sad that I can't enjoy one or two cocktails with my friends. I'm not sad that I can't neck 750ml of bottom shelf vodka alone in my bedroom at the slightest emotional inconvenience. But these actions have become one and the same for me. One cannot exist without the other.

My addiction recovery is a tightrope, and cocktails are a dive. I could embarrass myself - I know I'll lose my progress. The absolute best case scenario is that I start again at the tightrope with shame and unsteady footing - less to lose, and less to keep me grounded. The worst case scenario: it's a long way down.

I'm on this reddit channel since years been reading, but never ever posted. This is a throwaway account.
I did not find the response to my problem, so i will kindly ask, and hope anyone could help.

The problem is : 
I am always relapsing. Since months (maybe 6), almost every second day is a relapse. I mean I drink one day, the next one I am telling myself to stop. 
The other side of the problem is that I am feeling so bad the next day, that I have to drink to stop the physycal and mental pain. And here you have an endless loop.

The answer to my problem could be simple : do not drink the next day.
Well, for example, I almost do not remember yesterday.
I lost job
I lost car
I lost driving licence
I lost wife
I lost family and friends

I started drinking at 15 and noticed it helped me in social situations. Since then I often have been drinking too much and feel like it would be a waste to not drink (one more) when out. Especially in college it got me in some sticky situations that I am far from proud of. 
After some ridiculous embarrassing things and getting a long term boyfriend I stopped the binge drinking almost by itself. I just grew up I guess. 
Four years ago this changed when I moved cities and broke up with my boyfriend. I also started to study again. I felt young again and drank more. Since then I often had no limits and drank way too much. I thought this was just a case of transition but now it has been 4 years of this.
Often I go after guys because drunk me needs attention. Which is totally embarrassing. Yesterday I managed to snog a friend that I don’t even like like that and a few days ago I had a huge blackout and apparently followed another friend around. 
This sounds all very silly but I really feel the regret of turning into a person that I am not when sober. I do respect myself and others but my drunk me doesn’t. 
I feel like drinking less is maybe just not in it for me and I should just stop all together.

I knew I’d be able to get through the parties fine without alcohol, because I made sure I commited before and went in mentally prepared. What nearly got me was coming back home. I was exhausted from the effort at giving everyone a nice time and felt I really deserved a little reward - guess what my brain suggested… luckily my husband had already fetched the af beer, so I had my pizza with that and got over the moment. So realization number 1 is, that even with mental prep I can still get caught out and need to be on my guard. 
Realisation number 2 hits a bit harder. At both parties, I got offered alcohol by other mums and both these mums I would have considered normal drinkers, since I would always drink sooooo much more. BUT in both cases I noticed I somehow let them down by not drinking and looking back wonder if my role at previous parties was to make them feel better about their own drinking as it was a lot less.
Also for the first time ever I thought how messed up our society is to drink so matter of factly at kids parties!
Anyways I got through the weekend and learned a few new things which should come in handy at a work event later this week :)

I had felt the urge rising for days andI finally gave in. Frankly, it wasn‘t that much fun. The alcohol made me feel kind of befuddled and stupid and I woke up with a headache. The scary part was how my addict brain woke up and urged me to drink more more more. It was really hard to resist. The lesson I learnt from this experiment is that it‘s easier to abstain than to moderate. I hope I remember that.   
overall not a great experience. But here‘s to Sober November and sober days to come, my dear SD friends!",24

Last time I posted I was trying to go fully sober but ended up relapsing, then went sober for one week, then relapsed AGAIN. 6 days have gone by since then, and I was in a position similar to my last relapse. But instead of going to drink, I went through my sobriety plan and told myself I'd be sober for the first step, and the next, and so on. I'm laying in bed as I type this, and I feel proud of breaking it down a few minutes at a time until I couldn't get booze anymore today. I'm sure I'll still have moments of struggle, but my confidence has risen a little bit that I can make it through them.",10

I had known for awhile that my chronic binge drinking was a problem but I didn’t want to change it. It had gone from an occasional thing to an every weekend thing. I’m a barely over 100lb female and could finish almost a whole bottle of vodka in one night. It’s not like I was going to bars or parties either- I would be watching a movie with my friends and hiding alcohol in my water bottle, secretly pouring more or taking shots in my room during commercials. There were multiple occasions where I drank to the point of blacking out just drinking alone in my room.

But I had just started my last semester of college and I had a job lined up. I realized it was only going to get worse and if I was serious about my future I had to stop. So I chose my future and I have stuck with it since. I have certainly had moments where I’ve considered drinking again but when I wake up the next morning, remembering everything, no hangover, no embarrassing texts sent, no regrets I’m so happy that I didn’t. 

I moved from my college house to a single apartment after graduation. There’s a store right down the street from me. I could buy alcohol and drink anytime I want and there would be no one around to judge me or worry, no one to hide it from. But I don’t do it because it’s important to myself that I don’t. That’s so different from how I used to be and I’m so proud of that.",32

However, lately it has been getting more prevalent, and I often have the feeling that I have to quit my Antabuse and start drinking. I am fully aware of the consequences in that moment, but I don't care, even though I know that I will have to eventually.

I am battling with numorous illnesses, meaning that I don't really have anything to wake up to. Most of the days are really just spent killing time. I don't have the energy to meet with friends or do much that really means anything to me. This is something I am currently working on with healthcare proffesionals, and they say that they strongly believe that things will get better. But when this intense urge to drink comes, it is like I am willing to throw all of that away, just to feel a temporary sense of warmth and well-being. Things were hideous back when I was drinking, and I am kind of baffled that I want to go back to that place, yet that is the mindset I find myself in at times. I find it hard to believe that I am the only one who has experienced this, so if anyone has went through something similiar, how did you interpret this? And more importantly, what did you do to overcome it?",6

Today, I went to the ER with abdominal pain, mostly on the left side. It’s been going on for 5-6 days. After a CT scan, I was told there was enlargement in the spleen, and prostate. There was also a very small cyst on my liver. (1.2cm).  I have to call my primary doctor first thing in the morning and schedule a follow up.

I’m 40 years old, and have been drinking pretty much constantly since I was 20. From about age 20-30 it was drugs and hard liquor, with some beer sprinkled in. Pretty much if I was high, I was drinking whatever I could get. Finally I was able to get off of those things, but I filled the void with beer. I really thought it was better for me. (yes, I know!)

Today, after the ER visit, the very first thing to pop into my mind was a drink. All I needed was one…..but, I knew damn well where that would get me. And I’m seeing where it’s already got me.  I was feeling all the emotions as I sat in my truck, before I called my wife.  If I drink again, we might as well start shopping for a casket. 

Im sorry to ramble on, I’ve just got a lot going on in my head, and unable to sleep due to the discomfort. To sum everything up, I guess what I’m trying to say is……IWNDWYT, or tomorrow either!",104

I'm triple fucked. I'm the next generation. The new breed.

And I'm not good enough. I'm not good.

Telephone calls. You held me in June. We had three Junes together. This was our last. I can't talk to you. You're not there. You're the phantom in the room. Little remnants. Things you forgot. Shirts. A disconnected number. Memories. Mountains. Goals that were never achieved.

And here I am. And I need to be solid, solitary, stoic. But I'm tired.

Do you know that I think about dying every day?

I did, once. It was peaceful. Like the deepest sleep you could imagine. I love sleep. I am always tired. I always want to lay down.

I wish I could magically come to life again. But I'm just a bystander, looking through warped glass. I'm an inert energetic force. I am a paradox. I am honest. I am tired. I need a hand.

And every hand I hold doesn't have a tight enough grip.

And I think soon I will slip.",12

When I was drinking, I would black out the tail end of the night all the time. But tonight, as I’m getting ready for bed, my cat hopped in to sleep with me, and I was so overwhelmingly grateful that I was sober and conscious enough to appreciate it. 

If I were drunk, I’d never have remembered at best, or have lied down on her and ruined the experience (and potentially hurt her) at worst. 

Being more present in my family’s life was a big reason I chose to first cut back, and then cut out, the alcohol from my life. Getting to be present and have this quality time with my cat is the best feeling, and just another reason to stay sober.    

I’m relatively new to the r/stopdrinking group, but I’ve been checking in daily since I started trying to quit, and it really has been tremendously helpful. The good stories give me hope! The bad stories make me feel like I’m not alone in the fight. And the short, silly stories make me smile. So please, keep sharing your stories!

I wanted to just give up and drink but I fought through it. ""It's only two months, who cares."" I look back on that and feel proud.

This Halloween was far easier and I have experience now. I woke up happy and hydrated. My friends and I carved pumpkins. Then we put bubbles in my friends hot tub and splashed around like kids. It reminded me of the reasons why I love feeling alive. Those moments with people I love. I felt all of that sober and in the moment. I remember looking at the sky thinking ""this is what it's about"".
