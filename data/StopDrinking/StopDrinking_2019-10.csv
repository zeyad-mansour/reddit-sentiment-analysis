We may be a world apart, but we're here  together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard  time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a  daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a  three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have  already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink  alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we  don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not  to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and  sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one  person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right  mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up  or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready  to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to  not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Last weekend I had over 10 drinks. Spent the following day deadly hungover (which during my heaviest drinking right before I quit for five months would not have made feel sick). 

My dad died of pancreatic cancer over a decade ago. He abused alcohol. One day he turned yellow and six months later passed. It was a terrible experience to witness and I never fully dealt with it. 

The day after my binged I avoided looking at the whites of my eyes thinking that they would be yellow. I keep seeing light yellow (in my head) but I can’t shake the feeling that I damaged myself. 

I got a clean bill of health recently. I’m healthy however, my mind isn’t. I live in constant fear of developing jaundice because of drinking. I’m literally deadly afraid of alcohol (unless I’m drinking bc then I’m invincible and nothing matters - not even my mental health the next day).

I’ve been in mental anguish since the day I quit. Drinking is not worth it to me bc my mind can’t handle it. The constant checking for signs of jaundice is exhausting. I’m exhausted. 

Anyone else quit bc the day after is too punishment for your mental health?",5

Weekends filled with friends and booze, making memories we still talk about. Then we added Thursdays. Then I started bartending, and once I got in good at the bar, stopped refusing the shots we weren't supposed to take. Got close with a bunch of regulars and added Monday nights to my ""weekend"". Got into a horrible two year relationship with one of them. Started getting drunk on my three shifts a week. It escalated to getting blackout, forget to clean, leave notes on the till slips saying ""count it yourself"", forget to lock doors kind of drunk. Got fired. Really hit bottom after that.

Started calling out of my part-time day job (my only source of income at this point) at least twice a week, and went drinking instead. I very quickly ran out of savings. Then I realized it was all my reaction to how miserable I was at home. I left the horrible relationship, and even though I'm the one who left I went into a spiral. I started eating right and working out since I somehow managed to get a really amazing job for a high level doctor (who studies obesity and its related issues), but was ""rewarding"" my hard work with a mini of vodka when I got home from the gym. Then two minis. Then half a ""bar sized"" bottle. Then the whole thing, then buying two ""just in case"".

In a five year time span I went from a fully independent ""good time"", to now living with my mother at 37 years old. I haven't lived ""at home"" since I was 19. And I've been drinking vodka in secret like a curious 15 year old.  

I had to call out my really amazing job on Monday, because I was about to walk into work still very obviously drunk. And if I could tell how drunk I was, my doctor definitely could. So I walked a mile through one of the worse parts of my city, and took an Uber home.

My goal was to learn more about mental health and skincare. I went to meetings daily, I worked the steps...and then I got complacent. I got a new job! I changed cities! I escaped all the ""reasons"" I drank. I felt better. I blamed my drinking on my mental health and circumstance, so if I could keep those things in check, I could drink right? Right. So I thought.

 I had a glass of wine at a wedding...and nothing happened. I drank a little on vacation...and nothing happened. So then I thought an every other day happy hour at home was no biggie, and then I thought a beer or two at lunch wouldn't make a difference...and nothing happened...

Nothing happened for a whole year.

Then in the last week a few things HAVE HAPPENED. I won't minimize or hyperbolize, but I don't want to share them on reddit. But they are enough to add to a first step. They are enough to say I'm not just having a rough few weeks. They are enough to admit that I don't have this under control. Enough to say that booze and I aren't friends. Enough to say I'm done. I have to be done. I can't let it get worse. I have a child. 

I wanted to not be an alcoholic. Even when I started lurking in this sub a few months ago because I had that inkling...I expected my self-control to just kick the eff in. I was fully ready to explain to addiction specialists at my rehab why I was completely and actually terminally unique in my condition. They were going to marvel at me.

My actual experience this week has shown me otherwise. And that's what I have to listen to. Not my smarter-than-everything addict brain.

So I'm making this post as some sort of internal marker for accountability. For proof to my addict brain that I'm not just thinking about quitting. Instead of hitting the bar downstairs at lunch tomorrow, I'm going to a meeting. The meetings work for me. No matter what my mind says. It sucks in a way. But then again, it doesn't. I know what sobriety is like...and it's good. It's better than my last few months. It's better than any immediate relief I get from anxiously chugging wine. And I want to get back to it. I have to get back to it. I can't self destruct (Sigh,this is more of me hyping my self up for that lunch meeting tomorrow.)

Anyway, thanks for reading this. I'm hoping that this post popping up in my history and me writing down my intentions to be sober will motivate me more than the ""God, I think this is becoming an issue again....oh nah..."" self talk that has been circling my brain the past few weeks.

I wish I weren't this way. But denying it even a day longer could get me killed. I am powerless and I have to deal with it. I have to. 

I appreciate the existence of this sub and all of the posts that have appeared in my feed as I've lurked. It's helped me realize what my insides know to be true.

I need to be sober. And I will not drink tonight. I will not drink tomorrow morning. And then I'll take it from there.

2. Gotten engaged 
3. Bought a house 
4. Adopted a dog who is my whole damn LIFE
5. Lost 40 lbs
6. Gotten a raise at work
7. Went from not being able to run 2 minutes to being comfortable and happy running 10+ miles
8. Actual HOBBIES

I was very tempted to stop, but I just got my groceries and went home. She asked me if I got vodka, and I just told her “no” without any explanation. She understood and seemed to agree non-verbally that none of us really needs it, especially during the week.

Thing is, I can handle having a bottle in the house without being tempted, but if I have to go into a liquor store, I’m guaranteed to start looking around for a bottle I can stash in my room or grab a few minis at the register and pound them back before I get home.

I cut back my daily drinking after Easter. Since then I struggled to get a week or almost two sober in a row. I sometimes gave in to peer pressure and, more often, let the alcoholic brain win, sometimes for many days in a row. This past time was different. I spoke to a friend who told me that to quit, you have to take away the decision. As simple as this concept sounds, it has completely changed my life. Without the choice, I’m not feeling like I constantly have to decide to not drink. I just don’t drink.

I’m so much happier sober. I love having my life organized, eating well, exercising, and feeling emotions. I didn’t expect my self worth to increase as significantly as it has. I am proud of myself and feel successful. I noticed walking to work today how much my relationship with myself has changed when I caught my reflection and smiled rather than cringing for the first time in years.

I'm mostly keeping busy with work, but going to the gym semi-regularly (I've lost 60 pounds mostly from cutting out the extra 2000 calories daily I was getting from alcohol) and eating and sleeping so much better. Relationships have mostly all improved including at work.  And I have r/stopdrinking to thank for a big part of that, as this is where I first got the inspiration/motivation/encouragement to stop drinking and the drug use that went along with it.

I'd have all kinds of ways to justify it to myself, ""this will make me feel better!"" or, ""I'm just home not doing anything anyway, might as well get a buzz on,"" or, ""I deserve it.""

Now, it doesn't even sound good.  That kind of surprises me (because it's never NOT sounded good before).  I'm snuggled up on my couch ready to binge some Netflix in my comfy robe, probably going to make some tea and drink lots of water, and even contemplating making some soup if I can muster the energy.",2

I am new to all this and spent the last few hours reading all your posts - very helpful.

My story is that I have decided to give up drinking for a while as it is having a horrible effect on my life. I almost lost everything this weekend, including my life. I have drank everyday for the passed 10 months, most days a bottle of wine, but on a bad day 3.....I have had fits, I have self harmed, I have almost destroyed relationships and I am the verge of loosing my job. If you had told me a year ago I would be here, I would have laughed...but here I am...

I am on day 3 today and just back from a mental health crisis team meeting...I came out and wanted to go straight to the shop and buy wine. But i didn't. I am still sat here with cravings...but I am still sober so that is all I am going to focus on. I just keep feeling so overwhelmed by it all - this past month has felt like a nightmare...but I am ready to wake up now.

Please send any words of encouragement - all will be appreciated....

I’m a lot better at Xbox. Like way better, and just in time for the new call of duty too. All my online buddies have noticed. Lol. 

I’m getting invited to a lot of sober events. Parties, cookouts, football games, etc. I’ve made tons of sober friends my age through AA. We have a young persons meeting in KC every week and there’s always around 30 kids there usually age 18-30. We all go out to eat afterwards and it’s a ton of fun. 

I’m loving sobriety. Been through detox too many times to go back. I’m too young to keep continuing this shitty rehab cycle I’ve been stuck in. 

Here’s to sobriety. I won’t drink with y’all today.",17
2019-10-30 15:36:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dpbliq/just_venting/,Just venting,"I'm 9 days sober and feeling almost bipolar. Maybe because nuances in emotion are no longer dampened, so they feel extreme. One day I'm easy-going and hopeful, the next day is an existential crisis. Yesterday I thought this sobriety thing will be easy and I'll make it a few months no problem; this morning alcohol was all I could think about. I thought for sure I was gonna cash in at 9 days and ""just push harder next time,"" and drink as soon as I get home tonight. Now that I'm calm again I know it doesn't work like that, but that way of thinking made perfect sense to me just a few hours ago. Most of the physical withdrawal symptoms have subsided, with the exception of the occasional headache, but the mental aspect is so messy. Sleep is whack. Mostly more restful and continuous and I can get by with fewer hours, but I'm dreaming way more and I wake up groggy and unmotivated.

I'm depressed these days--have been for a while--but the voice putting me down and pushing my mind to dark places is quieter and more manageable now that I'm sober. Still there, still awful, but with the volume and frequency turned down. Like I'm having a fireside chat with my demon side who wants me dead. Still lonely, still lacking interest in my daily life. Maybe my depression will get a little less imposing when I start growing back dopamine receptors in a couple months (Idrk how that works). 

Anyway, for today I think I'll still make it without caving. Reading some posts here helped me out. Maybe I'll buy some 0.0% beer to have on hand in my fridge. I've never had it before. In any event it'd be a shame to waste the week+ of my life I've sacrificed to withdrawal, so I have to follow through and see where this takes me.

2019-10-30 15:32:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dpbjgk/ifu_by_drinking_on_antabuse/,IFU by drinking on Antabuse,"In case anyone out there is thinking of drinking on Antabuse:

Like a lot of people struggling with alcohol, my resolve to give up drinking is 100% when I wake up hungover, but by 4pm falls closer to 5%. Each evening I find myself easily convincing the part of me that wants to be sober that TOMORROW is a much better day to quit. Besides: today was stressful, was great, is my dog’s 147th month birthday, is the season finale of Top Chef, ends in a ""Y"".  I feel prisoner to my own addiction, so I finally decided to use my morning’s clarity to dictate my evening’s consumption by trying Antabuse.  After a proper booze filled send-off for my inebriation, I awoke Sunday morning and took a 125 mg pill.

Unfortunately, my 4 pm ego decided in its hubris that one dose of the drug isn’t enough for a constitution such as mine, and I’m probably immune anyways, so I picked up a six-pack of double IPAs around 6 pm and prepared for experimentation. I started with half of a beer and waited 45 minutes: nothing. So I drained that beer and waited another 30 minutes: nothing. No red face, no increased heartbeat, nothing. I killed the rest of the beers and went to bed.

Around 1 am, I woke up incredibly nauseated and my heart was beating so strongly I felt like a heart attack was imminent. I’m not one to throw up (maybe 4 times in my entire life, I’m 44), but I knew it was coming so I crawled to the toilet and let loose. I spent the next 4 hours in twisters: as soon as I would feel the vomiting subside, the diarrhea would start, then vice versa, and sometimes both would happen at the same time. My dog cowered under the bed, likely aghast at how a living creature could expel so much liquid and still live. Around 6 am I was able to pucker up long enough to drive myself to the ER (I’ve already driven away my wife and friends with my addiction).  Even after they treated the nausea, my tremors were so bad that I couldn’t legibly fill out the hospital forms and my blood pressure was through the roof. For the next few days, I felt incredibly lethargic, struggling with simple tasks. I felt like I had the flu. I couldn’t keep a coherent thought. I thought I was permanently damaged. It was awful.

I’m back to normal now, better even, as I’ve not had a drink since that experience 9 days ago. I still have intense cravings in the evenings, but the fear of reliving that awful experience (I’m still on Antabuse) removes the option of caving. Antabuse isn’t for everyone, but it’s given me more consecutive sober days than I’ve had in twenty years, and for that I’m thankful. The nights are becoming easier as I construct new habits and I feel hopeful for a day that I don’t need to use chemicals to help with my addiction. Right now I’m just very happy that I’m able to not have a drink with all of you today!

TL;DR: drinking on Antabuse = vomirhea.",9

I was driving there thinking about how great it would be if I could drink. My mind was rationalizing the AWESOMENESS of getting really-really drunk with people in costumes, being able to socialize better, not feel awkward, get loose. I told my brain to shut up. I’ve done this sober before, parties that is. Alcohol will not make it better. I will make a fool out of myself, forget things, slur my words, be sloppy, my wife will get pissed, I will feel like death being hungover…. The list of bad things goes on and on. So I get there and pretty much everyone was drinking, and I mean everyone, including a group of 14-16 year olds who were sneaking booze. I thought something seems off when they started getting REALLY rowdy. However, it wasn’t until I walked in on two of them vomiting and the rest panicked and crying, not my kids, but the parents got involved who were drunk and it just got out of control. That was me as a teenager. Fast forward an hour, and there is a dance party going on. Fun! I’m dancing with my wife. There’s two really drunk guys grinding, twerking, and dry humping between themselves and whoever walks past. They looked like idiots. People were laughing at them. Not cool! That was me a couple years ago. The end of the night came for me (10:00 PM) and one guy was passed out in a lawn chair. Beer still in his hand but his cigarette was on the grass. That was me last year. I finished my Halloween party last year as that guy. Passed out on a lawn chair. 

Alcohol and me do not mix. I think I’m skipping the Halloween party next year, and that’s ok.

I’m starting to romanticize drinking again. How nice it would be to have one glass of wine to unwind at the end of the day. I’m bored at my job so it’s not like I have a lot to unwind from. 

I have been substituting kombucha for something tasty to drink besides water but it’s expensive. For some reason sparkling water doesn’t have the same appeal as it used to.

It was more of a social thing. Then, I started into a downward spiral. I drank every day. I blacked out most weekends and even some days through the week. When I did get the energy to go to work, I felt like absolute shit and would vow to not drink that night. Guess what? I still did. I ruined so many relationships with people. I got severely depressed but kept drinking to try to mute those feelings. I luckily haven't gotten into any legal trouble from it but I am sure it was bound to happen at some point if i didn't slow down.   


I tried slowing down and limiting myself. It worked for the most part during the week, but when the weekends rolled around, I went all out again. I had some pretty terrible shit happen this last weekend that I am not yet comfortable enough to talk about. I decided that if I kept up my behavior, I was going to end up dead. I decided Sunday morning that I have had enough and I was going to quit for a long time, if not forever. I have a couple friends that have been very supportive and caring, so that's great. I already feel better. I've also come clean to some people about a lot of things that I had lied about in the past (seems like i lied a lot when drinking - and I know that I have a lot more to apologize to) and that has helped lift weight off of my shoulders, as well.

What I tell myself:
I want to drink moderately- to enjoy the taste and/or to be social, not to get buzzed. 

The reality:
My 8 months of sobriety has proven that every situation I encounter can be handled without alcohol. 

What this logically leads to:
If I don't want to get buzzed, I don't need to drink alcohol. 

What this means: 
I don't want to moderate, that's what the voice inside of me claims to want. It's just looking for something to grab onto, to pull me back into that life.

I drank too much last night. The feeling I have this morning is becoming more frequent than I like. I want it to end. In roughly 4 hours, I had 4 beers and about 1/3rd a bottle of whisky last night. I didn't drink Monday night or Sunday night, but Saturday I had 10 beers and half a bottle of wine.

I can't live like this anymore.

It's not every night, but it's definitely a problem. I haven't missed work, but did go in 2 hours late once. I just don't know what to do. I am stuck in a cycle of; having a few (3-4, reasonable) drinks 1-2 nights, mostly weekends, per week. Then having 1 really bad night of 10+ drinks, followed by a shitty day, 2-4 days of not drinking, and starting the cycle over again.

I'm concerned about my health, I'm concerned that it's going to get worse and I'm going to ruin my life and the lives of my family if I don't do something. I want to break the cycle.

First, I wish to thank those if you who take a second to add quick comments to these fairly common check-ins. It means a lot and I will try to do more of that too.

I've quit before. The longest was about 45 days. This time, it feels different. Easier? Maybe. But it's only day 2. I am tempted to go back and read my posts from that time but also want to leave the past behind and focus on looking forward. Not sure about that. Thoughts appreciated.

I know the first few days are tough, then comes a few days of exhilaration. Then it gets hard. I am ready for that. I hope. 

At one point I replied to someone who was struggling and said, ""It's easier to stay quit, than it is to start again."" So, I'm embracing that thought today. 

Have a good day everyone! IWNDWYT!",11
2019-10-30 10:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dp7pcm/30_days_sober_today/,30 days sober today!,"I was drinking 1 to 2 bottles of wine on a daily average. I have 30 days today and I was just thinking about all that I have done these past 30 days and not drank...

- fundraiser ball ( I offered to be the DD)
- 4 day trip. Business class, airports, hotels, dinners. Concierge sent up margaritas, booze everywhere.
- friends stayed over and stayed up drinking.
- extremely frustrated and stressed over a strained relationship.
- sales rep dropped off a wine and cheese basket.
- weekend activity with free alcohol
- book club
- dinner party
- bowling
- movie theatre with alcohol service and server
- watching my spouse open, pour, and savor drinking wine...
- having friends offer me a glass of wine and me saying no thanks just tea, while they keep asking “are you sure, no wine?”...🙀
- had an annoying relative that came to stay for a couple of days (I normally would have drank to avoid feelings of anxiety)
- feelings of sadness and boredom 

OMG! In hindsight it seems like a lot of drinking opportunities, because there were a lot! I also really liked to drink alone at home or in the hotel room and watch Netflix. 

I feel so happy to not have drank...waking up everyday and not having to do a mental check of “what did I do/say last night?” has been so refreshing. Knowing that when I feel poorly it is because I naturally don’t feel well and not because I drank poison.

If I could have one wish it would be to never have the mental struggle of thinking about drinking, and/or drinking and the consequences. I am so done with alcohol. I wish that it wasn’t so normalized in our culture...

I am proud to be 30 days without booze in my system. I have had a few episodes of bingeing and purging that I need to focus on and stop doing. I find that my brain chemistry (dopamine release) can get a similar high from binge eating and purging...ugh, it is so bad for me. 

Thank you to everyone on this forum...you have helped me immensely. I will not drink with you all today.",25

2019-10-30 08:55:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dp6ckb/beginning_the_journey/,Beginning the journey,"For the last about 6 years I have been a heavy drinker and some of that time also included drugs. In early June I successfully kicked the drugs. Unfortunately the damage was done and later that month I lost my job at a company I had almost been with for 5 years. I didn't go back to drugs but during that period I was unemployed I actually increased my drinking habit from buying a 5th of whiskey every day or two to getting the big jugs every 2 or 3 days. I was still job hunting and applying but I wasn't getting any offers, go figure.

A month and a half ago I got an offer and found this sub. You guys and the weight I gained the last 2 years are what keep pushing me to try and quit. My current weight is 270 and I was a slender guy my whole life. It's killed my self esteem, my energy, and my ability to socialize because of how much I've hated myself everyday now for most of my 20s. I haven't dated in 3 years and god damnit I want to change that before I'm 30.

Well I started the new job last week and I didn't think I could do it because of the commute. I am commuting by bus/train and to get there at 7 I have to wake up at 4am. I haven't been late once. Not only that, but just in a week and a half of working and only having had 1.5 fifths I already notice a difference. I intend to keep going for good and see what kind of progress I get. I went to a barber, got cleaned up, and for the first time in YEARS I actually smile at my reflection. I made friends with my new co-workers on the 2nd day which is a stark contrast from being the unapproachable IT guy at my last job. I also haven't had fast food in 2 weeks. The hospital I work at has a cafeteria so every morning I'm getting grains, yogurt, and fruit followed by a clean lunch. The biggest thing though is my sleep. I thought getting up at 4 instead of staying up till 2am drinking would rock me but not going to bed with the spins and craming fast food so I have time to drink was what I needed to sleep better and reduce my depression and anxiety. 

The last month at my last job when I quit drugs I also tried quitting alcohol and cigs at the same time. The mental consequences were so bad that while driving home stuck in traffic I would be crying so much my shirt was damp because I would be planning my suicide involuntarily. Everyday. Thinking about where I would do it, how I'd hand off my cats, what I'd have to leave on a note for my dad. I was at the lowest point I'd been in my life. Then my friend on a Thursday hung himself when he tried to stop taking his antidepressants. He was a drunk like me as well. We used to play games online together and just get blacked out. that following Monday I was fired.

Guys, I'm blessed to be alive today and I feel like I'm getting a second opportunity to try this again. I'm blessed to have found this community and I read your submissions everyday and participate in the comments sections when I can. I feel confident enough now to share what I went through and how quickly I am seeing a difference because I intend to make last weekend that last time I drink for a good long time. I think working in computers at the hospital also shook something inside me and put things in perspective. I brought this pain and sickness on myself but so many people don't have a say when disease and injury affects them in even worse ways. If I don't do something now I know it will get more difficult with every passing years and I've seen some of you mention loved ones who passed before they ever got a chance to see a color other than gray.

I'm on the train and trying not to cry so I'm ending it here but thank you so much. After a month sober I will leave an update. I should be getting medical benefits after 90 days and plan to go to the doctor and be 100% honest, get blood work and imaging done, and start a plan to get back to good health.

Day 154 & they give me nothing but aggravation & incentive to stay sober.,"Hey folks. Long time no post but thought I’d share. My neighbor is driving me nuts. Always accusing me of talking about her & if I talk to her, she puts word in my mouth accusing me of saying things I don’t. Hasn’t spoken to me, other than to scream accusations of such at me for 3-4 months. I talked with her a couple nights ago & though, ahh, maybe she will stop & we be friends again. Nope. I got a text the next day saying I had a slip of the tongue & said “it’s alright to talk about her if..”.  but she “called me on it”. I LOST IT. Told her she was bat shit crazy & to leave me alone! That lead to her coming to my door wanting to talk. She was drunk as could be, blaming me, blaming text message mid-reads & talking animatedly non-stop. She says she is bipolar & drinking that much with her meds is likely most of her problem. Or just drinking is really her entire problem. She always says “my anxiety makes me do x, y, z”... No! Her anxiety makes her do nothing! She needs to learn to control her behavior! She is getting really fat likely from drinking too much. The night she came down, her face was swollen up like a balloon. Don’t think she remembers the text war or coming to talk to me. Got a text at work today saying “she was sorry too if she didn’t say so”. She came down the night before to apologize & doesn’t remember. She asked me to come up & hang out a few minutes with her last night & she was sober. Well, more sober. Had a normal conversation but I was very limited in what I had to say bc she twists stuff I say in her brain. Her face didn’t look so big but the rest of her did. Wasn’t aware alcohol makes the face swell immediately. Wow. Anyhow she was complaining of terrible heartburn & she didn’t know why her stomach was so bloated. Humph. I do. Hope she figures it out soon. I can’t move right now & I love my place! We haven’t really been friends & she’s literally been yelling at me (projecting, blaming all her problems on something I (didn’t) say.) ever since I quit drinking & she didn’t. She gave me a nice jacket last night. That’s her MO. She is extremely bad & gives me something as a way to make it all ok. I’d prefer she just stopped the childish behavior! Very good incentive to never drink again. I don’t ever want to be like that! Just wanted to say this to someone. Thanks for being here & whomever said that “ this could escalate quickly” the first time I mentioned it on here was 100% right. I’m going to just say as little as possible to her from now on. Will be friendly but superficially. Hope that helps. Sheesh. Have a nice day everyone & IWNDWYT!",2

One thing that can make sobriety further complicated is the lack of ""cool"" drinks. I'm a foodie so the struggle is REAL when I'm at a nice restaurant and I have to drink Sprite with my filet-mignon. There are PLENTY of high quality non-alcohol options, trust me. Sadly, they are just forgotten about.I used to feel like a dumbass with my diet coke while my friends were having a nice bottle of wine, like I was missing out. Not because of the rush but because of the taste and the feeling of luxurious reward after a long week. Mine did not feel like a reward or a treat. The idea of reward can be complicated to begin with when it comes to addiction, you have to learn how to live without hunting for the feeling of gratification. But I really think getting the impression of treating yourself makes sobriety 10 times better if you're making healthy choices. It's realizing you can indulge without fucking up your week-end or your body.

So in the honor of not drinking today, here's my list of recommandations of ideas for delicious sober drinks! Please drop yours below :)(keep in mind I'm european but sometimes I'll go to specialty supermarkets to find my treat)

* **If you like sweets:**  
\- sodas duh. The easiest to find! Time try new ones, foreign ones too. Just don't overdue it on the sugar, it can be really bad in the long run.  
\- syrups! Try some high quality syrups, I swear it's worth the investment. My mom started buying me artisanal syrups to help with my sobriety and I've been chugging those. Orange blossom, fig, celery, mapple... you'll be amazed. Add fizzy water and lemon to it, kapow!  
\- Juices! You can buy them directly or invest in a blender if possible and make yourself a nice bottle for the day. My fav is mango/orange juice or watermelon.  
\- Any tea or herbal. I like to make my own ice tea or iced roiboos. Put it to infuse when you're getting ready in the morning so you have a nice tasty drink to come home to. Walk around in organic stores, you'll be surprised to find so many different tastes. I even now grow my own plants to make my home blend (lavender, minth and verbena). It's pretty much tasty water so helps if you struggle with staying hydrated.  
\- CHOCOLATE INFUSION. Kinda like a herbal but most people don't know about it. It's roasted cocoa beans. Super festive for the season, tastes great, super healthy too!
* **If you like bitters/spices:**  
\- Chinotto! If you miss bitter alcohols like I do (A LOT), I highly recommend chinotto syrups or sodas. It's a bitter citrus from Italia. The chinotto soda can go from a caramel flavoured coca-cola to a bitter fizz. I could live solely on bitter chinotto soda.  
\- Tonic water. It's bitter and fizzy and so refreshing with lemon and ice after a long day. Easy to find at bars or clubs as it's used as a mixer. Try lime and cayenne pepper with it, I highly recommend.
* **If you need to wake up:**  
\- Ginger juice. It's great to replace coffee and making it yourself is a cheap option. You have to buy a proper ginger gratter but it's super cheap on Amazon. You can make it as strong as you wish and I really like the burn. Honestly the best option when partying, I always buy a bottle when I go to a party, keeps me up all night! You can also add it to any cheap juice to make it fancier.  
\- Iced coffee of course. Just try to limit those as it can be quite addictive too and you might go overboard when you're battling bad mental health. You can add cinnamon or fancy vegan milks so your coffee feels like a treat in the winter. Wow, look at you, making yourself a nice treat, saving Starbucks money AND plastic cups.  
\- A dirty chaï. Need to wake up asap? Want to feel like you're ready to fight God? It's a chaï tea with a shot of expresso. You can make a weird version with adding ground ginger/cinnamon/random spices to your coffe.

Last but not least, WATER. Remember to stay hydrated. It makes your body feel better, your skin look better, it helps with your digestion so you don't feel bloated.

We may be a world apart, but we're here  together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard  time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a  daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a  three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have  already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink  alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we  don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not  to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and  sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one  person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right  mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up  or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready  to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to  not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Well hello, all you fine folk of SD!  And happy Wednesday to you.  Step right up and check yourself in.  Glad to have ya.  
Just a little topic for today:  Do you have any particular ""recovery"" podcast you like to listen to?  I have what I call my ""Big 3"".  Here are my current faves, in no particular order:
Annie Grace - This Naked Mind - Interviews, readers questions and more.  I started with This Naked Mind, so I have a soft spot for Annie.
Rachel Hart - Take a Break - I love her practical advice and learning about the ""Think Feel Act"" cycle.  She teaches you how to ""manage your mind"".  I like that.
Paul Churchhill - Recovery Elevator.  I like Paul's voice.  I enjoy his interviews and I always learn something.  His ""Alcohol is Shit"" book is good too.

We rode the bus together every day in school for 5 years.  Dated her briefly.  Ran into her 8 years ago.  I think she had mental problems and life was just a wreck, guy she was dating at the time is another good friend and he had to break it off with her because her stuff was just too crazy and he couldn’t help or deal with it.  Nobody is sure what happened, might have been suicide...it just sucks.  

I’m 44 and stressed the fuck out.  I can look back in time and see the years of my life, and now look forward and realize there is less time ahead of me and there is in front of me.  Work sucks, I do ok but I feel like I’m capable of so much more.  Anyway....mortality and midlife type stuff messing with me.  And here I am so clear sober just standing at the edge of all this unknown, not really knowing what to do, expect, what is possible, how much work it’s going to be to change everything, just feeling helpless.  All I wanted to do was numb my brain, sink into oblivion.  

Talked to my wife.  We sat and discussed some of the issues and what we could do.  The daughter is about out of the house, have healthy grandparents who aren’t going anywhere to be here for her if  daughter wants to stick around here.  Looking at SERIOUSLY downsizing and taking some risks with small businesses, moving somewhere exotic (to us) and trying some new things.  Having been doing the 9-5 thing for over 20 years and neither one of us are really happy.  ...I guess maybe sometimes you just need 4 new walls, you know?   

In any event, the discussion really turned my evening around and I’m so grateful I have such an awesome person in my life.  I didn’t drink tonight, and that’s all it takes.  One day, one evening, one moment at a time.  Just wanted to share that.   IWNDWYT",9

Similarities: 
- it took me WAY too long to realize I was in a terrible relationship
- my spouse/alcohol was telling me too many lies to count
- when I finally realized the relationship was dead I felt anxious but also relieved that I didn't have to pretend anymore
- crappy part: I'm having to deal with legal and financial issues because of this bad relationship
- another crappy part: there have been and will be more tears, four letter words, frustration and regrets

In my world, divorce is NOT a bad word. I came out of a bad marriage ten times stronger than before. It was terrible while I was going through it, but now I know what I'm worth. 

I'm nervous to be single AND sober, but I'll cross that bridge when I'm interested in dating again. Right now I'm more interested in dealing with my issues and getting to know who I am as a sober person.

**The Good:** Being sober means I can take medication if I have to without worrying about an interaction with alcohol. (For explanation, see my “The Bad.”)

**The Bad:** Am I starting to get depressed again, like when I was in my early twenties and had to be medicated? I hope not, because I really don’t want to go back onto antidepressants—but I have started having those familiar, old, terrible feelings. (Back when I was being medicated, I was also still drinking heavily—I’d lie to doctors about my alcohol use—so that period of my life was a total shit storm of endless blackouts.)

Because I dove into a pint of ice cream and dawdled in front of the TV. Do I care that I am up late? A bit, but mostly because I know how poorly I cope with sleep deprivation and know it can lead to poor choices. Plus, sugar fucks me up and I am wide awake for another couple of hours because of it and my stomach is off. But, I still did the nightly stuff I need to get done to have a functional day, even though it kept me up even later.

What is bothering me is the reason why I gorged on ice cream. It was just a niggling little...itch. Something not sitting quite right with me, but instead of taking a bit of time to address it and figure out what it was, I chose to do something that wasn’t satisfying and now I feel unwell. Is it the end of the world? No. But, I know that this same itch, this same discomfort of not quite knowing what to do with myself and of not wanting to do anything ‘adult’ leads to other escape behaviours, drinking among them. 

I am not tempted to drink tonight. And I am not beating myself up over ice cream. I am just noticing a pattern that I have actively been working on changing and that I don’t like. It is no longer serving me, and so it is time to let it go.

2019-10-29 21:37:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dozypv/addiction_vs_habit/,Addiction vs. habit,"6 months ago, when I lost a weed hook-up, rather than finding a new hook-up, I thought it was time to be done with weed. I had a lot of trouble giving up weed and it took me moving states to actually give it up (why I lost the hook-up) but I did it. Little did I know though, 6 months later, I’d have almost immediately transferred the nightly routine to  alcohol.

I don’t need to drink till I forget, get smashed, or feel better... rather just a nice buzz - 4-6 beers or so (I’m a pretty big guy), something fun to do each night while kicking back & watching Always Sunny or something. It doesn’t make me feel better about myself or happier, its simply just a cure to slight boredom, and a “why not” kind of thing. This was the exact relationship I had with weed, as well.

The problem I’m having is that, much like the weed, I have serious trouble going 3+ nights in a row without feeling bored and wanting that buzz. This makes me think I’m alcoholic.

HOWEVER, when I read the testimonies of people in r/stopdrinking and their descriptions of addiction/alcoholism, it seems they have/had a tendency to drink everything in sight, till they’re blacked out, as much as possible, along with other things like drinking during the day, going out in public with their family drunk, and so on. 

So my question is, does this sound like alcoholism, or just a problem with impulsivity and habit? The fact that my endeavors with weed were so similar, and the fact that I don’t need to get obliterated when I drink, really confuse me. Thanks for reading.",5

I went through a rough relationship/marriage that really beat the crap out of me emotionally. It led me to a wild life full of partying, drugs, and alcohol. But the problem was I started doing drugs (weed, coke, E) and alcohol alone. I got myself out of it and am living a pretty decent life now with a supporting family and many of my old friends. 

The problem is, I could never stop drinking. I pretty much became a functioning closet alcoholic. I know I need to change, because I feel the effect on my health. What are some helpful tips for quitting?",1

Everything was an obligation that got in the way of what I felt like I deserved, to just sit on the couch playing video games and wallowing in my self pity.

Fast forward a year to pumpkin carving last night.  I hadn't planned on doing it last night and I didnt mind doing it, didnt dread doing it,  looked forward to doing it.  I was patient, we laughed the whole time.  I put the goop on my 7 year olds leg and she was completely disgusted.  It was absolutely a blast.  I went to treatment back in march and except for one slip up right around the six month mark I've been sober.  I can tell my brain is getting better and joy is certainly coming back to my life.

2019-10-29 15:10:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/doukcg/72_hours_without_drinking/,72 Hours Without Drinking.,"This is the first time I have gone 3 days without beer or liquor in 3 or 4 years and I can count the amount of times I have gone 48 hours on my fingers.  Thus, 3 days is a big deal to me.  The fear of withdrawal was worse than the symptoms themselves to be honest.  I felt pretty weird, had some headaches, and small shakes in my hands.  I also woke up sweating three times the second night but that is about it.  I have been drinking loads of water and eating all the cupcakes and cookies that my kids got for Halloween to replace lost sugars. I did have a strong urge to drink pretty much all day yesterday but today, not so much.  Clarity of thought and positive emotions have been outweighing the desire to drink. Because it happened gradually, I never noticed all of the ways that drinking daily had begun to effect my mind, body, and soul even when I was not drinking.

(Edit: Just wanted to add something)

Also, I had done so many cringe worthy and sometimes downright wrong things while drunk.  99% of my regretted behavior was either while drunk or trying to get drunk.  My wife was getting pretty close to losing hope and giving up on me even though I didn't want to see that.  I had a realization that I can choose to stop now instead of letting myself hit rock bottom.

&#x200B;

YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR ROCK BOTTOM.

Please if you have been afraid to take those first steps don't let fear get in your way.

UPDATE:  It is around noon on day four and aside from a lingering headache I feel really good.  I've been in a playful mood and feel genuinely positive as far as my general mood goes.  It may sound corny to some, but I forgot what it feels like to have my regular mood back.  I know some folks don't or can't smoke weed but another plus is that weed actually does the things I like for it to do.  When you drink and smoke weed at the same time it just floors you harder.

EDIT 2:  I'm on the beginning of day six.  Starting to see how daily drinking effected my entire demeanor.  Starting to clearly understand how I got to that point.  For me it started with a construction job a few years back, where everyone drank a good bit.  After I left there I still kept drinking a lot.  Starting to remember that prior to that job I maintained ten or so years of adulthood only drinking occasionally.  It was always me making the decision, so I am not blaming that job or those people, just able to think about everything in an unbiased way without the addiction influencing my thought.

EDIT 3: For those of you in here, on Wednesday I went to the store with $5.  I was gonna go get as much cheap liquor as possible and talked myself down to cheap beer.  I went inside the gas station and bought one single 24 ounce Heineken tall boy and went home and drank it.

On Saturday night I asked my wife to get me another of the same.  After much deliberation I decided NOT to feel guilty about these two occurrences for the following reasons.

I was feeling some pretty intense withdrawal symptoms on both of those days to the extent that I was worried.  In the past I have used ""tapering"" as a way to temporarily drink less beer every night but in this case I feel like I only resorted to a minimal amount of beer at the last second in order to keep things on track.  I didn't drink last night and will not drink tonight but I may have 12 to 24 ounces of beer later in the week.

Honestly, I feel like that little bit actually helped keep me from having an uncontrolled relapse back into daily drinking of significant quantity. I do not wish to suggest that everyone do this because everyone has different needs.  I just wanted to put this out there in case there are any people that feel like they have failed because they gave in just a little.  For me having that little bit of (self disciplined) beer kept me from going flailing back into drinking heavily every day.  


Update:  Day 9 and going strong.  Thanks for everyone's support.  I am feeling more and more like I broke a previously uncontrollable pattern of drinking.  An addiction if you will.  Everyone has the rules they have set for themselves but I can't stress enough that if you feel like you have to break and drink during that first week this doesn't make you a failure.  Just keep it to a minimum quantity and frequency and pick yourself back up where you left off.  Giving up and heading head first back into your old patterns is the real backsliding.  Good luck to everyone trying to quit.",78

And it turns out it's mine.  I had a good laugh because I had **completely** forgotten about writing that stuff.  I discovered it as I went into an old email address to sign up here.

I find it rather telling.  In it I detail having an issue back in 2011.  With a post I dug up from WQD that I could have posted today as my thoughts were the same.  2011 had a small stint of sobriety.

Then we jump to 2014 when I'm right back in the same boat again giving it another try.  The blogging stopped about 6 months in after I fell back into drinking presumably after superbowl.  From what I remember I did end up stopping again and in total went about a year ""with less drinking"".

I wasn't completely sober.  I had occasional slips that weren't defeats but rather reminders of why I am doing this.

Unfortunately it's now 5 years later.  I can't remember when or why I picked up drinking again.  I don't know how I slipped out of that year off back into old habits.  But slip I did and here we are 5 years later in the same spot I was in 2011.  Same spot I was in in 2014.

So here we go again.  I could put lots of thoughts down but apparently I did so already 8 years ago lol.  What feels different this time is that I remember the feeling of deep remorse for several weeks thinking of my life without alcohol.  

I was seriously mourning my future.  I would be driving home from work and just thinking of all the future life events where I would not be able to enjoy alcohol.  And I had profound sadness over it.  

This time I don't feel that way at all.  I actually feel relief.  I feel optimistic and excited.

I read This Naked Mind over the weekend.  I might have strained my eyeballs with all the rolling they were doing at parts.  There was no aha moment.  No sudden solution.  But it did get me thinking of my perspective on alcohol.  I struggle hard with that fact that I am socially programmed to want alcohol.  It's a reward.  It shouldn't be.  But in my head that's what it is.  

Worked hard today.  Have a drink.  Big celebration.  Have a drink.  Little celebration.  Have a drink too.  Ski trips, vacations, superbowl, nice dinners, relaxing evenings on the porch.  If I could translate the images in my head visually they would all look like pharmaceutical commercials with people enjoying themselves in situations.  But It always involves alcohol.

So I find that is the biggest hurdle I need to overcome is my social programming.  It is what tests my willpower the most.  I deserve it.  This situation/event/interaction is supposed to involve alcohol.  Tv, media, life experiences.  It is so strongly driven into my brain.  

So here we go again.  Hopefully my motivation is better this time.  Hopefully I'm at a different place in my life that it clicks.  Hopefully my desire to stop drowns out the voice in my head.  Hopefully I can stay focused on what I feel is important in life.  Hopefully I finally gain control of my life.",6

After reading here about other people's experiences and struggles with alcohol and reflecting on my own life I realized that I had made a habit of alcohol - it became a part of the daily routine. Get home from work, have a few drinks, go to bed, wake up and go back to work, repeat.. It was a gradual process, so gradual that it never even seemed like a problem. What I did realize was that I was often tired, somewhat unmotivated and alcohol had also started taking it's toll on my personal life as well.

I decided to break that cycle and my doctor set me up with Naltrexone to help after I had researched some options. With Naltrexone, you take the medication, wait an hour and then have a drink (if you want) - or more - and it limits the ability of alcohol to trigger the pleasure centers of your brain (it's commonly used for opiate addicts) Google naltrexone and alcohol and there is a wealth of information out there about it.

I started it a month ago. On day 1, I did as instructed - took the med, waited an hour, and had a beer... That was it. Since then I've been taking it daily and I just don't want any alcohol at all. I haven't really craved having a drink of any kind. It may just be working that way with me, but others have reported similar experiences with it. I plan on continuing the treatment for a while longer before stopping the medication and evaluating how well I can do without it.

It has helped - part of it may be mental, but I have to say that I'm glad I had a little extra help from the medication. The only side effect I've experienced from the medicine is it seems to make me a bit sleepy - nothing too extreme but I certainly notice it.

I've felt worlds better and sleep through the night and I can honestly say I can see a huge difference between now and when I was a daily drinker. I'll continue to evaluate my progress and post another update down the road. I'm glad I found this group and that my doctor was willing to work with me on this path. IWNDWYT!!!",21

I’m new to reddit and created an account just for this forum. A little background info:

I just finished my PhD in psychology and in the process of registering as a child psychologist. 

I have been in an unhealthy relationship for approximately 3 years which ended last week because I finally had enough. She struggled with significant mental health challenges (attempted suicide on my birthday this year) and engaged in lots of unhealthy behaviours which my psychologist brain continued to rationalize for her and continued to give her second chances. She has a 6-year old son who had an extremely close relationship with me and I didn’t want to break that off either.

I began drinking secretly as means to cope as she slowly became less emotionally supportive. Over time, it increased in frequency and severity. In particular, over the past 3-4 months, I would work 9-5, head straight to the liquor store, sit in the parking lot of my apartment building, and drink about 200-300 ml of whiskey every day, and usually on an empty stomach. She had no idea of course. There were times where I was not intoxicated yet, and I would drive.

On the night of the breakup, I consumed a large amount of alcohol and decided to go out... however, I realized that I should simply turn back and head home. Unfortunately, on the last turn  before reaching my apartment building, I knocked the curb and ended up on a grassy hill which resulted in me getting a DUI. Spent the night in a holding cell, frightened my parents (my dad and I are co-owners of the car so they received the phone call while I was in holding). I was nearly 3X over the legal limit. My parents have hired a lawyer, but I’m terrified because I really don’t remember much about the accident or my time at the station and I am really worried about how it’ll affect my career. I have to pick up my car from the impound place, and I’m afraid to see how bad it was.

Over the last few days, my ex came around to pick things up, but I was drunk while in her presence (again, no idea). I spoke with my parents yesterday and I am ready to simply move on with my life and start fresh. 

My last drink was 25 hours ago and I’ve only been able to have water, despite knowing I’m hungry. My leg muscles are super sore (probably from the muscle loss from heavy drinking). I was wondering if any of you have some tips around working through the detox symptoms. I’ve made my bedroom cooler just to avoid feeling really warm.

Also wondering what are ways you have motivated yourself after hitting rock bottom. 

Thanks",5

Recent observations:

Over the weekend I was at a family event where people had to open a bottle of wine as soon as we got to our destination, like HAD to. when it was time to leave, someone with me was irritated that we had to leave, as it was impacting drinking.

&#x200B;

Last night after stopping at the store, this same person bought a full size bottle of whiskey, didn't mention it to me when I asked what she got - and then drank two shots of it when I went to bed, on a monday night - I saw this full size bottle hidden behind other stuff on top of our fridge.

Idk what the longest I’ve gone without drinking or using during that period is, but I am sure it is maybe a week max. I’m scared to take the plunge into sobriety. My entire identity is built around use, so who will I be when there is no more substances? I’ve decided to commit since two days ago I was fall down drunk and high in front of my six year old daughter. Hopefully I’ll be a better dad and husband. 

I’m afraid I won’t enjoy myself. I’m afraid I will just fail again. I might even be afraid of succeeding. 

Does anyone have experience with quitting poly-drug abuse? I feel like it might be a separate animal than just drinking alone, but I know drinking is where everything else tends to start. Any tips or tricks would be helpful. I feel like there is a long journey ahead....",3

I was programmed to pour, buy, order, consume, etc as much as possible whenever i had the chance. To a point where my decisions were clouded and i could rationalize drinking before and during the work day. Then race home and do it all over again. 

Part of me feels like it was a habit driven by the addiction and in some cases for me the need to get as much in me before my family was around. Which usually led to blacking out on the couch.",6

I'm 31 years old and have had a hit or miss relationship with alcohol since I started drinking at 17. Went to UCSB, a huge party school, and did the blackout binge drinking thing with buddies every weekend and got a couple of DIPs and one time cut my wrist so badly I needed 40 stitches (still have the scars to prove it). Binge drinking didn't stop after college, if anything it ramped up as I moved to LA and started partying hard with a bunch of like-minded people. Almost got a DUI at 27 (blew a .079). Blacked out many times (12 times or so a year). Woke up with black eyes, almost started fights, cheated on long-term SO, terrible 72-hour hangovers. Always managed to keep things at about this level, knew I had an issue but felt it was largely under control. Could go days/weeks without drinking, never felt need to drink in the mornings, never drank at work, etc. Thought I was OK.

Well, I visited my parents' house last weekend or so and they sat me down and told me that their house would be a strictly alcohol-free zone over the holidays this year and possible moving forward. I guess during last Xmas break I was downing 5-8 beers in front of them and walking around with a glass of bourbon at 1pm a few times. My mom, who is the main force behind this, has an extensive family history of alcoholism/addiction/other compulsions. At first, I was embarrassed (my parents have told my extended family in preparation for the holidays), but now I see it as just another red flag indicating that perhaps I don't have this thing under control after all.

So now I face the prospect of a dry holiday season at home in addition to the fact that my parents have seemingly made it official that I'm basically an alcohol. Feeling very confused at present. Don't know where I currently stand in my journey, I don't know what this means. Sigh.",12

That’s exciting because it means I’m not really counting and alcohol is no longer a part of my life. I have had the occasional thought about how good a glass of wine used to taste but I just let it go and before I know it is gone. The voice gets quieter and quieter. 

I’ve lost a bunch of weight and have been maintaining because I now have a sweet tooth that I like to indulge. Nothing serious, but I try to keep the chocolate and cookies within my overall calorie budget so that I can both enjoy them and maintain my healthier weight. I figure a little sweet treat is harmless compared to the untold damage I was doing to my body before.

I’ve also gotten a ton of dental work taken care of and now have excellent oral hygiene. Lots of other benefits too. All those alcohol-induced depressive thoughts are gone and no more hangxiety. I got a great promotion and I’m more productive than ever. Someone once said on here that the gains keep piling up the longer you are sober, and it’s true for me. I’m really enjoying being free, healthy and comfortable for the first time in decades. 

I have noticed that the healing of your body and brain chemistry is not linear. There are ups and downs and weeks of slump to power through but I always try to focus on the fact that the overall trajectory is positive. Alcohol is a thing of the past. Don’t miss it. Don’t want it. Don’t need it. I’m good, you guys. I’ll keep checking in from time to time but just wanted to post this to remind anyone who is just starting out that I was on Day One 7 months ago and I got here the same way everyone else does: one day at a time. I didn’t join AA, but I know it helps a lot of people. In my case I quit cold turkey and armed myself with resources.

I just want to hold onto the momentum!,"Hi everyone.  I am on day TWO.  I was sober for over 3 weeks...last month and was doing well, but thought I could moderate.

I went to AA and was doing well, but I admit going to AA was a blessing and a curse.  I felt like I was staring at a chocolate bar and wishing I could have it ...as opposed to seeing alcohol as the toxin and destructor that it is.

I have been going through major relationship issues and it's led me to self medicate.  I was drinking about a bottle of wine a day....but the last couple of weeks it was probably closer to 9 wine drinks a day.   My fiance is more of the angry aggressive type as opposed to the supportive type.  So, I started hiding some wine in the closet and avoiding him seeing me drink more than 2 glasses a day.

But he would go through all of my belongings and it was like a game to him (and me probably).  He didn't find my wine as of late....  but it hit me on Sunday that I draink 3 glasses of wine before 4pm....  had 2 margaritas....at dinner and then was slugging a few gulps of wine out of the bottle in the closet at night.  I don't know how that could ever be ok.... 

So I struggled yesterday but I did it!  And I always feel like if i can get sober for 24 hours without ANY wine....I start to feel a glimpse of hope.  So here I am...proud that I slept through the night...and I don't have a hang over.  Here we go for day 2.  IWNDWYT

Now I've not only beaten 150 days, I've doubled it and whilst I sometimes miss the feelings of being drunk I don't think I'll ever drink again.

I'm also trying to stick to other lifestyle changes - I eat a vegan diet and I avoid caffeine (in drink form at least, chocolate is kind of hard to give up!), both of these since around August. I'm doing these things now in my early thirties when I do wish I had done them in my teens or early twenties, but it's never too late to start.

This community has been one of the biggest reasons for my sobriety, both from reading posts to encouraging others on their own journey, both of which in turn encourage me to never again put alcohol into my body.

We would drink a liter of vodka a day each and she had a “water bottle” on her all the time. I begged her to get sober with me and we would drunkenly fight about it a couple times a week near the end. We hadn’t slept in the same bed for a few days and two Fridays ago she left for work with a bag to stay with her family for the weekend.

That Saturday I packed my stuff with the help of a friend, I couldn’t physically pack much because my health was rapidly getting worse, and I checked into detox Sunday morning. I sent her a text beforehand to let her know I had left and she only asked where I was checking into. 

I left her with a broken lease and a ton of shit to do. When I got my phone back it was full of texts from her calling me a coward and lots of other angry stuff.

The hurdles these people face are grand, and watching them overcome cravings and hardships without their crutch of addiction is inspiring, as well are some of the quotes they say.

Overall it has helped me more than any other show has. I've found no matter how negatively it's portrayed, watching people drink makes me want to drink. Even if the individual is being pulled away by the cops kicking and screaming watching them upturn a bottle to their mouths just gets me.

My life is regrets in that all these stories here talk of family, It's a thing, always, and always full of guilt. I owe them everything, and I return them this drunk man. I make money, have the idea of being accomplished, but I am unable to build the life I want to live because of drink.

I have had 3 times in the past 10 years where I've had to flee to family, and but for their love and forgiveness, survived, but, I, I, have tried always to do better.

But here I am today, on a curb, awaiting pizza, again, knowing what I can be without booze. But the third or fourth day away is terribly difficult.

I bought food for two homeless folks tonight, and proffered my skills to a man who wants to solve the problem of incarcerated folks not being able to contact their loved ones. It's a thing, and I always help. But I also yell into the void of this cyclical hell.

Thanks to any who read this. You're all great folks. I would not drink with you today, but I did, and I will suffer tomorrow's consequences yet again.

I was supposed to be doing the final court date today for my divorce, but my ex was MIA and hadn’t authorized his lawyer to sign for him, so I mostly spent the day hanging around my lawyer’s office waiting to see if he’d pick up his phone or answer an email so we could wrap this up. So we’re going to have to get another court date and try again.

If I had the option of going back and spending my day differently I would take it, but it is what it is. The finish line is in sight, and at this point a couple more weeks doesn’t make a helluva lot of difference. And I’m an alcoholic. I happen to be in recovery, but I’ve certainly gotten drunk at inappropriate times and screwed things up in the past myself. I’m so grateful that I’m sober, and I genuinely wish him well on his path. 

I did have some time during the day to head over to the local AA service office to hit a meeting. I have to admit that I’m self-centered enough that I sorta assumed I would run into someone who I know at the meeting. Because it is, of course, all about me and what I’m getting out of it. No such luck, although it was an interesting meeting. 

We read the second half of [the chapter on Step Twelve out of the Twelve &amp;amp;amp;amp; Twelve](https://www.aa.org/assets/en_US/en_step12.pdf). It’s a chapter that I’ve never read before, and it deals a lot with what life and relationships are like for people who are established in their sobriety and active in AA. There’s a lot of generalizations, but I got some useful points out of it.

After the meeting I verified that the books in the bookstore were the still the same ones that were there last week and I decided on which Grapevine book I was getting. (I settled on [Forming True Partnerships](https://store.aagrapevine.org/forming-true-partnerships). It was a toss-up between that and *Emotional Sobriety II: The Revenge Of Emotional Sobriety*, but I’m still working through the first *Emotional Sobriety* book, so I’m saving that one for a later visit.)

And by the time I came out of the bookstore the phone volunteers had changed shifts and I ran into a woman I know from my old Saturday morning women’s meeting. I find it extremely comforting to run into people who I know from AA meetings, it gives me a touchstone to anchor me on bad days, and it seems like I always run into people from the program when I’m having a rough time. 

Granted, I go to a lot of meetings and I tend to run into people at meetings, but I also have random encounters in the wild. I tend to isolate under pressure and it means a lot to me to know that people from my recovery support community are out there and that they’re there for me, they care about me.

On Sunday my sponsor told me that she thinks I’m about ready to move on from Step Three. (That’s the one where you work on not being a total control freak about your life who’s trying to force everything to happen according to your own agenda of how you think things should be, and you accept that it’s easier to actually get help and try to work with life as it is, rather than trying to force the rest of the world to conform to your own version of reality. It builds on Step Two, where you accept that maybe you aren’t all-knowing and all-powerful and you need some help because you’re hella crazy.)

Which means that I’m getting ready to move into Step Four, which is the one where you write down all of the crap that you don’t want to talk about or admit to anybody *and then* you look at how you were actually the one causing problems in your own damn life instead of blaming everybody else. It is the step that kept me at arms length from AA for quite a while. And I find that I am okay with the prospect of doing it now.

For one thing, I trust my sponsor. We’ve been working together for a year now, and she has more than earned that trust. I know that she values and respects me. I know that she has my best interests at heart. And I know that she’s not going to ask me to do anything that she hasn’t done herself. I trust her guidance. She’s been sober for a long time. She has a practical, kind, humble, and enthusiastic sobriety. And she’s helped a lot of other women get sober. She knows what works.

I also trust that she works a strong, spiritual program. We were barely two minutes into our conversation when she told me that her gut feeling was that I’m about ready to move on from Step Three. I had an intense week that I hadn’t had a chance to really talk with her about yet, and she knew before I’d told her that I was really feeling and experiencing the step. And I am. I wasn’t ready for it a day before, but I have come through it and learned the step. I’m living it. Not perfectly, and not all the time, but I have proof of it in my own life and in my own felt experience. 

I am different now from how I was when I started it. My sponsorship line works slow, I’ve been on this step for somewhere around five months. (I think.) It has frequently been frustrating for me to go that slow, but looking back, I can see the difference in how I view my life and how I live my life that has occurred over the course of doing this step. I can see it in my work life, my interpersonal relationships, how I go about my daily business, how I plan for the future and think about the past, and how I view myself. I have experienced a fundamental change. Life is better now, and if I keep going and doing what works, I get to keep this. 

Having a Higher Power in AA is not entitled bullshit à la [The Secret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(book)). (*The Secret* is possibly going to make it on my Fourth Step Grudge List, but this is already long, and that’s a tangent.) Turning my will and my life over to my HP doesn’t mean that I get what I want. My divorce is not being settled to my advantage. I’m still working a job that I don’t particularly want to be at. And various other things in my life have not worked out the way that I would have liked since I started doing my Third Step.

This is all fine. Things are how they’re supposed to be. I have what I need. I am growing. My life is not moving in the direction that I wanted it to move in, it’s moving in the direction that I’m supposed to be going in. Just because I’m not trying to micromanage the outcome and I don’t have any clue where this is going doesn’t mean that it’s not going in the right direction. 

I am where I need to be, and I know what I need to know. I trust that things will be okay in a deep and meaningful way, not in a shallow and unsatisfying way. I don’t need to control it, I just have to keep doing the right thing, as much as I can, and trust the process. I can let go.

I hope that you all are well. If any of you made it this far, thanks for hanging in with me. I send you my love, wherever you are on your journey. You are where you’re supposed to be. It will work out. Keep going.

My marriage is broken, it was broken before but the booze covered the problems (by making bigger problems). 

I’m here to say to anyone who will listen, that I have not given up. To go back to sitting in a bar all day is no life at all, and worse than death. I will stop smoking again, and I will step back onto the path of a good life.

I’m a week and half sober, and planning to stay on it. Just having strong withdrawals since it’s the type of boring day and time (almost 10pm) I’d usually start drinking on. 

I’m a working student that also practices Latin dances. I’m pretty proficient, but nowhere near where I should be because of my drinking. To give you an idea, i’d stop practicing for weeks at a time because I’d be too tired from drinking every weekend (for months, it was Friday-sunday), going to work, and school. I’d miss the latter too sometimes as well. My instructor is bordered by my inconsistency, because i should be competing by now.

 Occasionally, but rarely, I’d drink after a stressful day at work too.. and miss work the next day. I worked 10hr days, 4pm-2:30am, plus full time morning school, so it was extremely irresponsible of me to be drinking. But I guess I gave myself the excuse that I was using it to cope with my stresses. 

My GPA was great (3.8gpa) before this semester, unfortunately I completely bombed these fall classes (4 classes I’m definitely going to fail). In part because of the work schedule I had, but mostly because I’d keep drinking every weekend. I’m sort of a binge drinker in the sense that once I start, I feel like I have little control and keep drinking until I’m drunk. I’ll also keep having drinks to avoid losing the drunkness.

I’ve made some changes these past few days, such as starting a new job with better pay, less hours, and more reasonable time frames for school work and stuff. So next semester will definitely be better. I also want to stay sober. 

I’m not going to lie, this week and a half has been difficult. I didn’t think I was an alcoholic until i stopped drinking, and only saw it as a minor problem, now idk. I’m craving it every day, find myself mindlessly bored in my free time, and am eating a lot of sweets out of stress. I think I’m also very stressed because all of my friends drink a lot, and I know I will probably give in if they’re persistent about me also drinking (which will happen), so I’ve been alone. I’m used to being very social.

I think subconsciously I’m making excuses to drink again, so tomorrow I’m going to exercise before work, prepare a healthy lunch/breakfast, and start reading some of the books I’ve bought. I know patience is key, and I need to get on a good path again before it ruins me.",2

I felt relaxed, alert, and appreciative of my good dinner -- which was actually pretty much the same as if I'd been drinking just seltzer, although gastronomically, I'm sure Chianti was the better accompaniment to the meal.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/)  and have a hard  time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me  and feel you need a  daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a  long time and want to  inspire others.

It  doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a  three day bender or  been sober for years, if you just woke up or have  already completed a  sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink  alcohol!

\---

\*\*This  pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we  don't set out \*trying\* not  to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not  to drink\*. It sounds  simple, but all of us know it can be hard and  sometimes impossible. The  group can support and inspire us, yet only one  person can decide if we  drink today. Give that person the right  mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up  or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready  to give up.

\*\*What  this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to  not drinking alcohol for  the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and  making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any  time, you do not have to be a regular at  [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What  this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself,  directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more  personal response in your own thread.

I'm super proud of myself and I recognize and appreciate all the positives I've gained since I quit drinking. I sleep well (it feels so good),  I have more energy and time to devote to school and hobbies. I have lost weight, saved so much money, and I feel so much better in general.

However, there is one thing that is missing. The majority of my friends are long term friends I've known since I was young. However, they also have drinking problems. My more casual friendships also revolved around alcohol (I think I'm to blame for that). I haven't genuinely socialized without alcohol playing some factor in it for ages. I'm single. I see my family often but I wouldn't consider my family to be close in the way that I used to feel with friends.

I'm very happy with how I spend my time when I'm alone, I have a lot of interests and hobbies that keep me going. But eventually, I just miss talking and having fun with people.

I quit because of health problems (I get my liver enzymes checked again a week from today, hopefully they will show some improvement) and even if that were not the case, I don't think drinking in moderation socially is something that I could manage. I was a very heavy drinker both by myself and in social situations. I can't imagine putting that amount of poison into my body again.

I don't know how to adjust to a sober social life. I feel like I can't really connect to my friends like I used to and thinking about trying to meet new friends in a new social circle at this age just feels weird. Life just feels lonely and I feel like I've lost the ability to connect with people.

I'm sure my experience is not unique. I know there is likely much more fulfilling relationships and experiences in store for me. But right now, I'm just curious about other's experiences with this aspect of getting sober. Has anyone else gone through this? What was it like and had it improved? Any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks for everything, ya'll and IWNDWYT",7

Hi r/stopdrinking!  It's good to be back here!
 
I frequented between 2017 and 2018, when I successfully put an end to over a decade of drinking with 380+ days sober.  I got into fitness, lost 65 pounds (which I posted some pictures of that ended up in an article about not drinking on the Chive... somehow? -ha!)

But in late 2018 I succumbed to that voice that says ""You've beat it, you can moderate now! ... maybe stick with beer!"" ... Well that lasted a couple weeks, and back to the hard stuff.  I needed to re-admit to myself that I don't drink casually or moderately, as someone here said magnificently in a thread last night, ""I drink until I don't exist anymore.""

I've been battling it since then - I've still kept off most of the weight and do practice some better habits, but I've slowly gone back to the point of waking up anxious, panicky, and shaky (My hangovers and alcohol consequences seem to be more nervous system and not so much vomiting or that sort of thing)

Anyway, I tried a few extended periods off over the year, but have had a hard time maintaining.  This past weekend (which I'm happy to announce I completed sober!) marked the first I really sat down and started reading through StopDrinking again.  And it instantly reminded me of how helpful this community is, remembering my first time getting sober.  I'm happy to be back and say hi.

Still in the irritable stage, kind of grumpy and disappointed at the things I'll ""miss out on"" by not being able to drink.

And I’m wanting alcohol more than ever,"This time of the year has been so triggering for me. I work retail and the holidays are coming up.. if that says anything. I can’t stop fantasizing about drinking.. how nice it would be to go to a bar alone for a couple of drinks, then go home and drink 5 more drinks. I’d be a pleasant drunk then drift off into sleep. But, that only happens when I put certain constraints around my drinking; don’t drink the first one until around 10:30-11pm, that way I won’t get down to my last one before 2am when you can’t buy anymore alcohol, so I’m not tempted to Uber to the store to buy another tall boy, because the first seven beers weren’t enough. Another constraint I put on myself was to not have any more alcohol in the house than I planned on drinking in one setting. Because if I had an endless supply, I’d no doubt drink until I’d have no memory of going to bed, even if I was alone at home on a weeknight. Honestly, not drinking at all is easier than having to stick to all of those “rules” I placed around my drinking. This upcoming weekend I’m going to a wedding of a friend from college I used to party with all the time. It’s gonna be tough. I don’t know if I’m mentally prepared for all of the “why are you not drinking??” shit. Ugh. Sorry I’m rambling.

I couldn’t imagine a fun carefree life without alcohol. I al the crazy drunk fun friend after all. I read all of these books on other people who had successfully done it.

I committed to one day at a time with no agenda. 

I’ve been on a 10 day summer vacation, two weddings, multiple restaurants and a few bar visits and I’ve been completely fine, if not, thrived. I had the most fun at a wedding I’ve ever had. 

I still have a lot of work to do with feeling comfortable in certain situations. Or really understanding the core of what makes me feel alive and joyful. Right now it’s been exercise but I have a feeling I need to add in volunteering and spend more time with family.

I almost stabbed a party guest with a knife,"Earlier this year, I had been drinking about 6-14 drinks a day - from Wine, Cocktails, Rum, Bourbon, Tequila, etc. I have been known as a great bartender and party host, along with my wife. 

For years we’ve thrown parties with some epic turn outs, awesome moments, with almost nobody getting sick. No “shots”, just cocktails, wine, beer. 

I would usually get drunk enough to function, sometimes barely. I would start drinking at 1 or 2pm, prep and serve food, get bombarded by guests wanting drinks, but happy to make them. I got smart and started making mass batches of house-made margarita or Mai Tais. Those also became famous and got people pretty drunk. 

Fast forward to train wrecks and blackouts, parties barely functioning, an oven with burnt fat dripping filing the party with smoke, and me barely able to handle cooking and serving for a party of 50. 

On May 6th this year I had hit my rock bottom out in Los Angeles on a bender with friends, which I’ll tell as a separate story. 

I took that rock bottom, along with a previous 12 months of deeply contemplating sobriety, reading Reddit Stop Drinking and the CA groups, reading Russel Brand’s Recovery book, and promised to do the work, call it done, and go sober. 

I’m now 175 days sober, and it’s been life changing. The first 3 months were euphoric with my newfound freedom. Since then, I’ve been learning to cope with ups and downs, and doing well, but it hasn’t been easy. I don’t have cravings for alcohol, but life is still challenging and I don’t have the crutch, but I do have the ability to face my feelings, talk about them, do something about them, take a nap, go for a walk, hit the gym, talk to my wife, therapist, play guitar, eat some tasty food, etc.  

So something that’s been a source of anxiety for my wife and I have been the question of what do we do about these big parties we used to throw? How do they work without us drinking? 

After much deliberation, we decided to throw a Halloween party this last weekend, and announce that we no longer drink, but people can bring their own. The caveat was, that any booze left over will be given away or disposed of. 

Fast forward to the party, on a night that PG&E has announced that they will shut off power due to fire hazards. We decide the party will go on. 

The party starts off going well, I have no cravings, I get overwhelmed and lost at times, but overall way clearer and focused then with booze. I had prepped TriTip steak to grill and was contemplating going for it, when BOOM - the power goes out. 

People scream and laugh excitedly, and I go into battery backup plan execution. I scramble to get that all going, get the music back up and running, and feeling frantic. Then it’s a rush to get the TriTip grilling. 

I bust it out on the grill outside on the deck and sear it, with about 8-10 people watching me do it. A friend asks if I need something to carve it on, I say yes, and he grabs a cutting board. Then asks if he should bring the knife. I hesitate in indecision, and then finally say in a hardy voice, yes bring out the knife!

I take the meat off the grill, start carving up the 4 pound monster, asking loudly if it looks like enough of a sacrifice, met with enthusiasm from the crowd. I put some tasty meat on a plate, carve up some more. Suddenly one of our most anticipated newly invited guests arrives, she yells my name and I turn around yelling “Hi!” and she reaches out for a hug, and I just naturally go for a hug - WITH KNIFE IN HAND - and when I turn back around to resume cutting the steak, the whole party vibe on the deck had changed with strange glances and mutterings and ambiguous concern, and me in a confused overwhelmed excited state. 

I had hugged her with a large knife in hand and people were frightened, disturbed, and probably really questioned my sanity and might have thought I was drunk or on drugs, but I absolutely was not. 

I tried to make sense of what had happened, what led to that moment, how I went off caution, why it didn’t register as a big deal, and how I dealt with things after the fact. I made fun of it to some degree to get people to talk to me about it. I also told our guest, I’m so grateful she wasn’t hurt. She did not seem scared and said I’m the best.  My wife said it was just a mistake. 

One friend called the move from his vantage point, “straight up Penn And Teller shit.” A shocking magic trick.

I found myself confused and disoriented, because I felt in total control, but some people were very unnerved. I realize it was simply wrong and something I shouldn’t have done, and will strive to never do again. There was a combination of distractions that had me in that mind state. 

Within the next hour, I reenacted the event with a friend, to try to salvage my sanity. What made me not think of putting down the knife? Was this as insane as it looked to others? My friend reached out to hug me and looked at my right hand motion and I could see there was probably a 1ft clearance of the knife not hitting her. 

However to others not in my line of sight, it probably looked horrifyingly close and psychotically dangerous. In the reenactment, I can understand that it might have been my sober clarity that might have given me the subconscious confidence that I was very much in control, and felt like it all they way up until other people were freaking out. But I should have had the 1st instinct to drop the knife. It’s been 2 days of obsessing over this, and I don’t drink anymore, so chances are I won’t forget this for life. 

All of this had me questioning my stability and for all these years drinking, what kind of mental damage have I done. Overall I feel way better, more confident, less anxiety, better communication, and vastly improved memory. 

But this event has me really questioning things. 

After the party wound down, dispersed, and cleanup was done, I went to sleep for a solid 8 hours. 

Got up to have a protein shake and saw a 3/4 5th of Fireball Whisky. No craving, just a memory of what I would have done - taken a shot, maybe finish it off by the end of the day. I take the bottle and dump the juice in the sink. My wife asks me, how did that smell? I replied, I didn’t smell it. Then smelled the remaining bottle. It smells like Isopropyl alcohol and cinnamon. Not good. 

IWNDWYT. But I’m not sure about my reflexes after this. I’m not sure what to think about myself. I quit drinking, feeling way better, throw a party, and almost stabbed a guest - worse than anything else I almost did when I was drunk. WTF?!? 

What should I think of all this?",1

I’m doing well but times like this get me a bit anxious, especially when I think about the next few months, when I am going to be extremely busy with work.

Part of me believes I will be able to handle it better this year than last. 1) Not drinking keeps me clear headed and less anxious overall. Plus, there will be fewer evenings where I stay up late, because I only generally did that to drink. 2) I was relatively new in my job this time last year and the big event that is going to cause me so much work is now one that I have done before. I think I will be better able to plan, delegate and stay focused because of both of the above reasons.

I still worry though, because I have a long history of taking on too much, making a bigger deal of things than I should, and burning myself out. I know that I have also had some kind of substance problem since I was 19. Without it, I should be able to remain clear and hopefully build stamina (mental and emotional). But I worry about slipping into old habits. I also worry about remaining sober and having the same problems anyway. 

I try not to linger on self doubt though and I know that even if I become no better at handling an increased workload, I will still be better off with booze.

I have poor boundaries when someone looks me in the eye and asks a direct question, and I was caught on the spot. I divulged something - not bad at all, but something that triggers my husband’s shame and he’d asked me not to share - to someone.

He was very upset with me and I felt dreadful about it. I felt ashamed and disloyal. He rarely gets upset with me, and when he does he withdraws deep into himself, which in turn triggers my shame and fears of abandonment and rejection. 

I played a game that I read about in The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober called Sliding Doors, where you play out two possible futures in your mind.

In the past I would have drank to numb the emotions. I would have stewed on the issue, decided my husband was an arsehole for treating me like that (!) and sulked, slammed doors, picked a fight to “talk about it” and slept on the couch. He would have spent the evening trying to escape me. Then I would have woken up marinating in shame, remorse and self-loathing, *and* with dreadful behaviour to make amends for. And a hangover. God, the cringe. Just writing that out makes me want to melt into the floor. What ignoble behaviour. 

Instead, I behaved like myself. The real Starlight. I apologised properly and gave him plenty of space. I was kind and gentle with him - and with myself. I did a private inventory of strengths I need to cultivate to prevent this happening again. He went to bed early, and when I came to bed I curled behind him. 

It’s early morning now. He’s still asleep. My conscience is clear and the storm will pass.

Do I cope better, I suppose so.  Or maybe I just do fewer stupid things that need coping with.

Getting up for work is definitely easier, chilling out after a day at work is probably harder.

I’m not richer, although it scares me how much I’d financially be struggling if I had spent the £3000 that I reckon I’ve saved by not buying booze this year (and that’s just me, my husband stopped with me too!).

I still struggle with depression and anxiety, but on a much lesser scale, again probably mainly to do with doing less stupid shit that needs regretting and fretting about!

My diet is better, I exercise more, I go out less in the evenings but do more during the day.

I read so many posts about overwhelming positive life transformations that people experience when they stop.  This hasn’t been my experience, although objectively looking back, I definitely wouldn’t go back there either.

We’re hopefully approaching the tail end of a divorce, during which I’ve learned about his infidelities, including during IVF, his seemingly out of the blue confused sexuality and a whole host of other things that would have sent me off the deep end if I’d been drowning my sorrows the way I had been. 

I’m not being hyperbolic when I say that quitting drinking has probably saved my life. Going through all this has been unbearably painful, but I’ve set in motion healthy ways to deal with it: exercising, meditation, medication, therapy, a daily gratitude journal, a daily sober journal, etc. If I wasn’t sober and doing all of this, I can’t imagine how I would be managing any of it. 

So very, very grateful to this community, my ever-supportive friends and family, and whatever higher power exists that’s pulling me through this and into the light. Everything is less cloudy and more clear in sobriety, and with that comes a gut-level conviction that things are aligning for me in the ways they’re finally meant to.

The trigger was an inability to combat a sense of worthlessness brought on by my expectations of my soulmate.  I felt like I only had one thing left in my toolbelt to ward away the hurt, drinking!

This morning, she apologized and promised to be careful of supporting my goals by joining me on a sober journey together. This was my first break in an otherwise successful challenge to overcome my addictions. I am not resentful of this moment, because it showed me that there are indeed limitations to my resilience after 3 months.

Starting over, yes...but, now I have another learning experience to offer to others in this sub and elsewhere....if you love someone and she/he doesn't take the necessary care to protect your life from the ill-effects of addiction, then you need to clearly tell him/her that they can be an insurmountable trigger and you are going to side with your sober happiness rather than allowing them this malignant power.  Additionally, if you can meditate yourself to sleep, then you will have successfully overcome the need to medicate the emotional pain with alcohol.",1

When you do forgive people who have hurt you in such a toxic way through or with alcohol or substance abuse. Do you tell them? Do you ring them up, a year of just not being around them, avoiding them even- and *tell* them you forgive them? This person was once a good friend that was always down for a drink or twelve. When I got sober, freshly sober, she hurt me. so much, I hated her for so long, I talked so much shit and told her I wanted nothing to do with her, to fuck off and leave me alone. I was mean, so mean because it seemed to be the only thing that worked. Our mutual friends saw her drowning in her tumbler glass and couldn't save her and many chose the sobriety road with me. Now, shes alone and I feel bad.

With her it's a matter were she has said she was sorry for that incident  but she doesn't remember fully her actions due to her being drunk  and the last time she apologized to me about it was at a bar, after I watched her slurp down her third Gin & Tonic. She only apologizes when shes drunk which we can all agree is not an actual apology,  this being said I know she's wrapped in guilt about why I no longer even speak or text her. She knows she's fucked up but I don't think she's ACTUALLY realized it. Or maybe she has, I wouldn't know, Do you tell someone you forgive them but no longer want to ever interact with them? or just ignore it?

I don't know if it would relieve her or hurt her and I by opening communication.

I drank pretty heavily from age 18 to 38, then doubled down and became a party animal from 38 to 43.

I was a pretty heavy drinker, but high functioning. My tolerance got pretty out of control and I was able to polish off most of a fifth of bourbon without it slowing me down much. It got to a point where Jack Daniels or Jameo (or anything not 90+ proof) barely even worked anymore.

Add to that the anxiety, heart palpitations and sudden inability to sleep past 2am without waking up in a cold sweat pining for another drink and it was time for me to make a change.

I had tapered a bit in the weeks leading up to my last drink, but that last day I got triggered, had just “a few beers” at a Bears game and still had all the same bullshit side effects later that evening. I had a Valium left over from some dental work and felt forced to take it out of fear of my heart pounding away into the night and my complete inability to sleep. 

And that’s when I decided that enough was enough. That was my last drink ever - a “low alcohol” session IPA that left me feeling horrible.

I’d be lying if I said every moment of the last 365 days had been easy or that there hadn’t been temptation, but it also wasn’t the most insanely difficult thing I’d ever done. I just chose not to drink and chose to stay committed to and calm about that decision, one moment, one day, one week and month at a time until I strung together a whole year of sobriety, and that feels good.

I am proud of my accomplishment. I haven’t missed a Saturday or Sunday morning feeling nauseous or sleeping one off while I miss what precious little time I have with my ever growing, ever changing 4 year old daughter. I’ve been there every day this year, bright and sober, ready to read, build Legos or ride bikes, and that makes me happy.

I’ve gone to a dozen or so sporting events, times where I would have gotten shitfaced, sloppy drunk in the past 100% sober and have thoroughly enjoyed being present and mindful for every pitch or touchdown while not getting dehydrated or having a headache or eating shitty Mexican food or pizza at 4am to start sobering up.

I have also saved a fuckton of money (at least $4000 by my estimate) which I have been able to use for more productive things like paying down debts, funding vacations or financing the newly minted LEGO habit both myself and my daughter enjoy sharing together.

Life is good without alcohol. It has been different. I miss it sometimes but the vast majority of the time I don’t at all and it has really given me a lot of insight as to who I am and why I was even drinking so excessively and regularly in the first place.

This sub has been huge for me. You are all integral and a true inspiration. The support of everyone and their ability to share their stories - good or bad - have made my journey to this point possible.

Here’s to another fine year with you fine people.

Like we went on for an hour, she seemed to enjoy herself, I went on for two rounds. But it just made me realise so much. I'm Bisexual (M) and I remember the first few times I slept with women it was so off I thought I must be gay, then I found out I'm actually Bi. Now it's shocked me that sober sex was just physical and nothing emotional, and the person is nice, but I won't be repeating it again as it just felt like a glorified wank, and I was having sex because she wanted to, not because I wanted to, sorry if I come across rude.

I have come to terms with the fact that sex for me has to be emotional as much as it's physical, and I was clearly using alcohol and drugs to hide my insecurities. I dunno where else to say this, so thought I'd post it here and see if any of yous had similar experiences?

I’ve become a textbook example of “in denial.” I don’t have anyone who will hit me the hard truth, so I decided to do it myself.","I’ve tried a 100 times, told my friends I’m going to quit or reduce my drinking, and fail every time.

Here’s my denial excuses and why they are wrong :

Denial: I’m healthy, I workout, I don’t have a beer gut, the wait on the scale stays the same, I meal prep, I eat healthy.

The real truth: You’re not working out as much as you did in the past. You numbers came back with high cholesterol and blood pressure for the first time ever. Your body is starting to push back because it’s so inflamed all the time. You are getting fat. Your abs are gone, if you put on as much weight as you did this year for 5 years, you’ll be praying to get back to even a dadbod. Your stomach is constantly mad at you. Your health is FINALLY declining and you are FINALLY having repercussions that affect your long term help. It’s a miracle you made it this far.

Denial: My anxiety disorder and panic attacks are a legitimate reason to need to sedate yourself. My anxiety is a perfectly acceptable reason to not be able to remain sober.

The real truth: your anxiety is exacerbated by your drinking. It’s probably the root cause. You have negligible anxiety when you’re not drinking. You can’t cope with reality and use drinking as an escape to ease that anxiety instead of figuring out a way to live with yourself. If you stop drinking 90% of your anxiety will go away. Go to the doctor. Get some clonezepam and some antidepressants for that 10% of the time and stop drinking.

Denial: I maintain a job and pay my bills. I must not be an alcoholic because I just got a new job with a 30% raise!

The real truth: you are struggling to get out of bed every morning, playing catch-up by binge drinking a gallon of water, basing your breakfast choice on what will best suit your hangover/rehydration. You have called out of work twice already. You lie and come up with excuses for why you are always absent minded and slow. You got lucky with the new job. You will not be able to keep up if you continue to drink. YOU KEEP A FUCKING HANGOVER KIT IN YOUR WORK BAG. There’s not such thing as a high functioning alcoholic.

Denial: well at least it’s not heroin.

The real truth: when heroin was ruining your life and health, you quit. And it paid off. Congrats on quitting heroin. That was 4 years ago. You face a new life-ruining challenge. It’s destroying every aspect of your life. Do something. That almost killed you literally and directly AND YOU STILL WENT BACK. 

Denial: I can have just a few if I really needed to.

The real truth: yeah you can. Until you have to drive somewhere and then you don’t want it to stop so you stop by the liquor store on the way back and get shitfaced at home. If you could have just a few and stop.... why do you do it so little? You’ve told you friends a thousand times your quitting to the point where they’re tired of hearing it. The only difference between 1 beer and 12 beers is the amount of time you have before you pass out and still have enough sleep to not call out of work the next day.


Denial: at least I’m not like _________.

Truth: you are running out of people to compare to. All those people got sober. Eventually you’ll be comparing yourself to sterling archer, Rick Sanchez, bender Rodriguez because no one can compare any more and these are the only people whose repercussions never catch up with them. Because they’re fictional. This idea that you have that you can keep this up is also fictional.  You are not fictional.

What was a hard truth you had to tell yourself to sober up? What was something you heard that spoke wisdom into your denial filled brain? I need the help. It’s gonna be a shitty night.",25

Last week I was to work out my two weeks notice at a job I have had nearly 25 years. I blame it for my addiction often and used that as an excuse. 
I thought starting over was the best option and my family finally understands how important that is. 
I did not work my notice and went on a three day dive into a vodka depression. I called my boss who knew of my condition and told her I had to quit now. 
She suspected that I had relapsed but never checked on me. That hurt. 
My wife called and spoke to me with real support for once knowing what I had done(She is traveling).

I made a choice Saturday to let this demon die. 
To be honest, I should have gone to the hospital since the DTs were kicking in. I did a purification hydration and vomited so hard that it felt like something evil was released. I felt instantly better and spent the weekend reading this subreddit.

Usually, having a hotel room to myself means that I buy a bottle or two of wine, a six pack or two of spiked seltzer and I either go out with colleagues to drink, then come back to my room and drink or I stay in and get drunk alone. 

This weekend, I kept it to two on Friday and four (over six hours) on Saturday. I didn’t drink at all yesterday. I have been going through about 4x this much alcohol on weekends for the past couple of months. 

The conference was a big deal, I mean, really big deal. The culminating event led me into a room to meet the person second in line to the presidency and then dinner seated at a table right behind them. I dined with state senators. 

Usually, I’m incredibly hungover at these conferences. Instead, this time, while I didn’t stay alcohol free, I didn’t get drunk. I was up at 6:30 am each morning, no headache, no brain fog, no hangover. I didn’t sit quietly, anxious or so tired that I couldn’t focus. Im going to try not to drink at all at my next conference.

I was perceptive. I contributed clearly. I learned. 
I felt light and clear-headed throughout each day, despite the stress. I took breaks whenever I could and got away to the quiet of my room when all the interactions started to wear me down. I didn’t band aid it with drinking. 


I also didn’t drink at all yesterday. I woke up without a hangover or brain fog for the first Monday in probably two months.

I’m not where I want to be, but I’m on my way there. I’m not drinking today.

I am by no means a teacher of sobriety, but these are some few key things that have helped me that I'd like to share. 

Firstly, all that matters is the desire to stop drinking. This was something I heard at my second AA meeting and since then it stuck with me. I came out of a detox with this desire, yet drank again. Although, that one drink was it. Afterwards I poured a full bottle of wine down the drain and hadn't picked up another drink since. Now whenever I worry that I may stumble again, I keep in mind that the desire will stay with me and each time I try to quit I will have learnt from before. 

Second, make it easy for yourself. This means take it one day at a time and do what works for you. I've had people tell me to go to AA, and others not. Drink this instead, no that. Keep yourself busy, no meditate. Everyone is going to tell you something different, but all that matters is doing what works for you. Personally, I found that 1 or 2 AA meetings a week works for me. I drink lots of water, tea or a can of soda on a hot day. I keep a timetable so that I have things to do, but still have free time to enjoy life. 

&#x200B;

There is still much I seek to learn. 

AA meetings. They have been helpful, but even at my favourite ones I have had negative experiences. I am only 22, so  I tend to feel that I am too young or haven't suffered long enough to be part of AA. I'm still looking around for new ones, but feel like I will always be out of place due to my age. On top of that, there always seems to be people who are close minded or share dark experiences that demotivate me. I never judge, but hearing how low rock bottom can get and how many times some have relapsed scares me. Do I keep going despite not being able to control these demotivating experiences?

Support. So far I have had AA and my alcoholic mum as my main supporters, although, as you can see they may not always be the best. I lost all my friends because of my drinking and want to wait until I've spent more time sober before I get in touch with them again (if I do). The councilor I see suggests I look on websites such as MeetUp, where people get together for hobbies. I admit I haven't done this yet, so will give it a go. Does anyone have other suggestions?

When I was a much younger drunkass, someone told me your not an alcoholic if you can stop for a month. I have traditionally stopped drinking for a month somewhere throughout each year, just to prove it to myself, but I know it's bullshit. I know I'm an alcoholic. My wife knows. My kids will recognize it one day too. 

Two Saturdays in a row I overdid it, blacking out yet again. Waking up with instant remorse and a raging hangover is so old and tiring. I need to grow up and take control because I can't moderate my intake.

My number one reason is that I'm killing myself. And yeah that scares me but in a distant way. What truly strikes fear into my heart is leaving my kid to grow up without me. And it's so real and close - my BP is fucked, I'm overweight and practically crippled. I'm a terrible parent even if I kid myself that binge drinking after the kid goes to bed won't affect him.

2019-10-28 04:34:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/do61wx/aok_monday_sunshine/,AoK Monday: Sunshine,"Hi everyone! AoK Monday is a weekly thread where we check in about AoK that have touched us this week. It can be AoK that we’ve performed, that we’ve received, or that we’ve observed or heard about. It can be for ourselves, others, animals, or the environment. Any AoK that touches us is fair game.

This week’s AoK is from a news article about [over a hundred strangers who went out of their way to make the birthday of a four year old cancer survivor special](https://epaper.ajc.com/popovers/dynamic_article_popover.aspx?artguid=d9c415ef-66bc-4ef5-b34c-407eba596c30&utm_source=app.pagesuite&utm_medium=app-interaction&utm_campaign=pagesuite-epaper-ipad_share-article&appid=2870).

The boy was diagnosed with stage four cancer shortly after his first birthday. He was recently cleared as being well enough to attend preschool, with only one concerning spot remaining on his scans. 

His parents came up with an idea for how to make his walk to school on his fourth birthday special. They put up a Facebook post asking for people with yellow cars to drive by with yellow cars on his walk to school. He was fixated with one yellow car in their neighborhood because it reminded him of his favorite Transformer Bumblebee, and he often begs his parents to drive past the house where it’s parked.

Over a hundred yellow cars showed up for his walk to school that day. I’m touched by both the thoughtfulness of his parents in actually considering what would make *him* happy. They didn’t do something that they thought that he *should* like, they took him as an individual into account and put thought into what would actually bring him joy.

And I’m touched by all of the people who saw the post, or heard about it from others, and then who actually made the time and put the effort into following through. Mornings are busy, life is busy, and that does involve scheduling your day so that you can be there for a little boy who you don’t even know. And you’re there as one among many, you could just not show up, and no one would know, and other people *would* show up. But over a hundred people showed up. It was a selfless AoK on their part.

So that’s me for this week. How about everyone else, any AoK that you’d like to share?",17

I've been following this sub for a while and have finally gathered to courage to make a post. I've got a couple questions that I hope to get answered by people who were in the same situation as me and of course everyone that wants to give me a good shake or part some wisdom.

You can skip this part if you want ↓

I'm 18 years old and have been drinking pretty heavily for the past two years, knowing full well what I could be doing to my body and my psyche. And I've finally hit the point where I'm feeling the damage. Since I started drinking heavily, it's been anywhere from 3-10 beers a night. Because my father's an alcoholic and I've been nicking the beer off him, the drinks have ranged from normal 4.5% beers to 9% IPA's. I'd say that out of the 730 or so days since I started, between 30-60 have been sober nights. When I go to parties I'll drink as many as 15 beers and still be standing at 140 pounds. I know I have a problem. I've thought about telling my dad that I've been taking his beers, but I really don't want to face up to him or my mom. He hasn't noticed the theft because I've been  a sneaky little shit and wait until he's passed out before I take them, and put the empty cans back under the carport where he drinks them. So I guess I've been making him think that he's really going through 24 or so beers a day, which is horrible. I just started my freshman year of college and am on a full ride, plus I get a refund of the excess money, but I haven't been going to all my classes because I wake up drunk and can't drive my damn car. I thought maybe it was in my head but I've been using a BAC calculator, and often when I wake up my concentration is at .1 or above. So I'm on my way to loose a couple scholarships if I don't get my shit together now. I want to move out and start working again, but I've fallen into horrible laziness.

So my first question: Is it dangerous to stop cold after drinking 3-10 beers a night (on average 6) for two years? 

2. Does anxiety get better or worse with sobriety?

3. How much damage do you suppose I've done to my brain? (I'm 18 so I guess my brain will repair itself to a degree)

4. Are there others that were in my situation, and if so, how did you stop, and do you feel like you've been rehabilitated or do you feel like something's still missing?",3

I have been trying off and on to get and stay sober for several years now. I have joined some groups, such as Refuge Recovery, and spent a lot of time on this sub, both of which have helped immensely during my longer spells of sobriety. That being said, I seem to still have a hard time staying sober for anything longer than a month or two. I recently decided to give AA a try, and I liked a lot of the people I met. I liked hearing their stories, feeling like I wasn't alone in my feelings of dependence, and getting encouragement from hearing about their recovery. But then there are other things which are huge turnoffs. I have met a lot of people who when I tell them my own experience, they respond with what really sounds more like a slogan than an actual thought they're having. When I spoke to one guy who was leading a meeting, he got this very solemn look in his eye when he asked me 'are you an alcoholic?' and was very officious when he informed me 'well, you're welcome here as a visitor until you get a sponsor and work the steps' which just felt kindof...churchy? I had a really awful experience with organized religion growing up, and admittedly I can be skittish around anything that even resembles religion. For what its worth, I do consider myself an alcoholic, but also somewhat object to treating 'alcoholic' like its a magic word. I don't mean to insult anyone or discount the positive impact AA has clearly had for millions of people. But I also can't get over the fact that lots of people I meet in AA kinda make my skin crawl. Am I being prideful? Am I missing something? If you used some other group/method to get sober, what was it?",13

I've been working on cutting back for a couple months now. Today was the first day I really saw progress. I didn't spend the whole day fighting an urge to drink. I didn't even have to be on here posting. Honestly, I didn't even stay super busy. I just really didn't want to drink.

Just a sad evening spent shitting fire at the end of a two day hangover. I’ve been on the toilet for the better part of an hour, doubled over between the nauseating waves of pain, waiting for the flow of brown lava to cease. No doubt I’ll pop a hemorrhoid the size of my nose.

I’ve been half-assing between moderation and sobriety for about a year now, and Friday night was my biggest drunk since. Me and my buddy split four bottles of wine on my couch and bullshitted till 3am. Honestly, it was a good time. I quit the first time because I kept humiliating myself socially. I quit now because my body can’t take it. 

Let me tell you what moderation has cost me:

-stalled progress on my novel
-gained 20lb
-lost all yoga gains
-wrecked my sleep cycle
-missed a family member coming in from out of state due to hangover (that one was yesterday)

All that, not to mention the smaller blows: wasted money, daily joint pain, living in a messy house, being late to work. I’m so tired of feeling like a scummier, sleepier version of myself. 

A literal fire has been lit in my ass. I would be honored to be back among you all. Also if anybody knows a good cure for the ultra hangover shits, I’d appreciate that, because it’s taken me awhile to write this and I’m STILL sitting here wondering if it’s possible to pass out from the shits.",2

I am two days sober and new to AA. Today’s meeting has left me feeling extremely discouraged. Someone else in the group cross-talked and referenced an experience that I (and only I) had shared, exclaiming, “Wow, what an ego” and basically chastising me for my feelings. Nobody stopped him. It was humiliating.

I think the person with the real ego problem is the one who has been sober for several years and came to a beginners’ meeting and judged people with mere days of sobriety.

2019-10-27 23:31:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/do3i8f/20_days/,20 days,"So I haven’t had 20 days sober in a while. In my real life I have a hard time being honest about my sobriety and my drinking. I didn’t want to let people down and I was really in denial about what constitutes a relapse/that I had a real problem/that I was “sober” because of the problem, not for a diet, health consciousness, etc.

The thing is, this time, I genuinely want to be sober. That’s never happened while I’m sober. I’ve wanted to be sober while withdrawing a billion times but I’m sitting here at 20 days sober and not crawling out of my skin dying for a drink. I’m actually wrapping up a 16 hour shift. One hour to go!

This time all I’ve done differently is take it one day at a time and commit to myself everyday that I want to be sober. I upped my time working from 40-50 hours a week to 70-80. I hit the gym every single day(except 2 days because I chose sleeping 6.5 hours between work shifts instead of 5). I started painting again. I cook all my own meals and drink lots of water now. I love NA beer (one or two a night a couple nights a week)

I feel like by just doing me, and focusing on my needs and not listening to the “you should do this...don’t do that” mantras, I am really in control. I need to be constantly engaged in something and I have a lot of debt that is crippling me with anxiety when it crosses my mind. Why not work extra hours to keep busy and fix my problem? I have an extra 20 pounds of fat, so why not workout everyday? I’m not injuring myself, I’m not overdoing it, these are relatively moderate workouts. And I really do crave beer, why not drink beer that will satisfy the craving and not harm me? 

I was told for years, sit in meetings, read the same books over and over again, and pray. Don’t change your lifestyle all at once. Don’t drink any beer NA or not. Well, I can’t just sit around and think about not drinking. But I’m having a wildly different experience by just doing whatever I want to do that is not drinking. 

I am very fortunate to have overtime I can take or leave. I can decide tomorrow to cut my hours back and I’ll be fine, no pressure to do it or not. 

If I get overworked, I can dial it back and slowly learn how to handle down time but I think down time is bullshit anyway. I relax every night for an hour or so before bed. I don’t mindlessly watch television, I meditate for an hour, listen to dharma talks, or I just relax in darkness. Honestly I think that’s more recharging and healthy than 3 hours of Netflix a night or social media. When I leave work, short of turning on some meditation music, I won’t touch technology. I spend my down time intentionally and I find myself more clear the next day on what really matters to me, what reality is, and if my job didn’t involve computers and have a television on 24/7, i doubt I’d miss it.

I think doing something like sitting in front of the tv at night and trying to not drink would be hell. I know it is because I’ve done it. I think not having a tight schedule where getting a workout in means getting up and getting going right away would give me room to torture myself with the “why not drink tonight” question. I have no time for drinking and it’s because I’m bettering my life instead.",2

Today, we await the divorce to go through and I am just a little bit more over two years sober.

Truthfully, it's difficult. Not sobriety, but the situation. I am sad a lot. I feel sorry for myself sometimes. I get mad. My ex blamed my sobriety- saying I changed. Saying that he wasn't in love with me anymore. Saying the girlfriend he had for over a year made him happy. Some days I wake in a panic and have to remind myself I am capable in order to get out of bed.

My son and I moved to a new place. We live in an adorable little farmhouse, a daydream come true for me. I got job and have been realizing how much I missed working- how isolated I was at home. I am spending time with family and friends- I am stretching out this me I began to discover two years ago. I have even met a man, also sober, who likes to take walks and makes me laugh. I don't recognize my life except I do- it's the dream I clung to when I decided to stop drinking. Yes, it's painful and unlike what I expected or maybe even hoped for at one point, but I am experiencing every single bit of it with a whole lot of gratitude.

Things change. Our thought patterns, the people around us, the absolute potential of every day in every moment. Today, I choose to be open to that potential, I choose to be here for it. Today, I choose to honor the potential in me by honoring the potential of the present moment. Today I choose sobriety.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard  time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a  daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to  inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a  three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have  already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink  alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we  don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not  to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and  sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one  person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right  mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up  or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready  to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to  not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that  they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and  participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at  /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed  introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories.  You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Ordered a whiskey, maybe it was just insufficient dosage or something, maybe more alcohol will make the fun come back. Nope. It did literally nothing.

He's been homeless, the last time I had him home, he stole cash from me. He's been spiraling the last few months, and today I got a call that he is in a locked ward at a local hospital, detoxing from heroin. This is what I suspected, his grandparents too, we all had a long talk today, on the same page, united front when he comes home, we're gonna help him kick this. I spoke to him on the phone for a few minutes and he sounds determined and willing to make the changes he needs to make. He's through the worst of the withdrawls, but he was telling me how bad it was, and it made me think of my views on hangovers, and how it deters me from wanting to drink. I told him he NEVER has to go through that again. The only person that can put you through that again is YOU. I told him ""When you hate someone, you want them to suffer. Depression, mental illness, addictions  can make you hate yourself, so you do things to hurt yourself. I want you to feel sorry for yourself, because  when you feel sorry for someone, you want to make things better for them."" This is the mindset that really made sobriety click for me, that I dont deserve all the crap I was putting myself through, and I need to make him see that he doesnt deserve it either. He grew up watching my addictive destructive behaviors and that is how he's been living as an adult. I'm really hoping I can use  everything I've learned in the last 3 years to guide him now, lead by example and show him another way to live.    


Sorry for the unorganized wall of text, I just had to get this off my chest. I got the call from my son's father right in the middle of a pre-teen Halloween party with a dozen screeching girls, I've coasted through the evening in kind of a shell-shock, just sinking in now. He will be discharged as soon as tomorrow (been in since Thurs) and said he's been set up with 3 different programs (outpatient) So I'll be taking him to all of those appointments, and NA meetings. I have a friend who has been clean for 8 years, super-active in NA who can point us to the best meetings. I'm gonna get us into some family counseling as well.     


I am exhausted just writing this out. And I still have a Halloween party to clean up. Once the last kid left and the house was quiet, I thought about drinking. Drinking and crying. But I can't fuck my own brain up like that, I gotta stay mentally strong enough enough to stand beside my son in his struggles to come. So instead, I'm gonna eat a cookie or 4 and watch The Walking Dead.  


Much love  IWNDWYT",6

I found a closed bottle of my favorite rum, opened it, took a sip, and then spit it out.","I'm 26 and live in NYC. I've been homeless (living in a shelter) for about a year after getting blackout drunk and being robbed for an entire months worth of rent (long story). I've been struggling with alcohol since I was 16. At first, it was my only means to have a good time because I grew up in a really abusive household and the only time I really felt like ""myself"" was when I was drunk. It became a part of my personality. At some point, even though I was living my life everyday, I had realized I already gave up. I developed a ""fuck it, it doesn't matter"" personality and lived my life on a day to day basis. I've been fired from nearly every job I've ever had for the same reason. Either showing up super late for work or just not showing up at all or being drunk at work and acting all moody/etc. I was pretty functional but not functional enough apparently. I picked up photography a few years back and it really changed my entire life. It gave me something to push towards and work for. I cut off most of my drinking buddies and all the negative people in my life, but I took my bad habit with me. I learned photography while drunk, did multiple photoshoots shitfaced, took some of my best photos drunk, roamed the city and met so many amazing people and had so many amazing moments I can SOMEWHAT remember. I've had 4 cameras stolen from me while I was blackout drunk. It's just... Alot. I've always had a habit of being extremely disappointed in myself after waking up hungover.. Not remembering the night before or what kind of shit I was posting in my instagram stories or what kind of shit I was saying to people in my messages. I'd be scared to open them up or watch or read them. It was exhausting. I felt disgusting all the time and yet I kept going back because it wasn't even about drinking to feel nice anymore. It was just a force of habit. It was just a part of what I did or atleast that's what I told myself.

&#x200B;

It wasnt until last year that I really started to get serious about self improvement and really started to understand that I determined the kind of person I become. I realized my future self was looking back at me and talking loads of shit. I realized that I was the cause of, as well as the solution, to most of my problems. And so, I decided then to do better. Of course, we all know how that works out sometimes and I ended up going 3 days sober here and there. The problem was that I replaced my drinking with weed and thought ""Well atleast im not drinking alcohol""... It wasn't until the beginning of this year that I realized replacing one thing with another was just as bad and doubly expensive. I felt like I had no control... I felt powerless. Even though I was doing many other things that I felt I needed to do, I felt like I kept taking 3 steps forward and 8 steps back. I felt weak and disappointed in myself. But then I realized something...

Even though I ended up breaking my streak... March was the longest I had ever went without alcohol since I had been drinking at 16. It was about 15 days. I remember it perfectly. I was in the library trying to plan out what I'd be doing this fall and I had decided I'd go back to college and I'd pursue photography. I remember feeling my brain just out of nowhere start rationalizing why I should go and buy alcohol that day, even though I had work an hour or two later. And I did buy alcohol, I drank half of it and threw it away. And I ended up drinking again and again. I had a sober app and it'd be an off and on battle for months. Now in those few months, I didn't let alcohol stop me from improving my photography or applying to classes and getting into school last month but it was still a problem I needed to handle. Until last weekend.  

It was like an epiphany. Like knowing something all the time but finally understanding.. A human beings strongest ability is our ability to decide. If I wanted to be better.. If I wanted to become the person I envisioned myself to be.. I had to work hard. Not the bullshit effort  that I've been convincing myself I've been putting in to quit but ACTUALLY trying. I realized that if I wanted my willpower to improve, Id have to constantly remind myself every day who it was I wanted to be and where it was that I wanted to end up and I kept asking myself the same question everyday.

&#x200B;

""Is drinking today worth sacrificing the person that I want to be?"" 

&#x200B;

And the answer was always no. The last drink I had was last saturday, I went out and got fucked up with a friend and woke up feeling disgusting and disappointed in myself yet again. Since then, i've been consistently writing in my journal. Planning every single day, I've planned everything I need to do for the next year step by step that'll bring me closer to my goals. On friday, I found out I was being transferred from the really clean mens shelter that I lived in to the worst homeless shelter in NYC. I was extremely upset. I also had my film camera stolen by someone who lived there as well as I was packing up my belongings. I left the shelter at 11pm to head to the new place with the thought that I'd request a transfer to another spot that wasn't detrimental to my improvement. The shelter I was staying at is literally across the street from a popular club where people tend to hide the bottles of alcohol they bought around the facility since they cant bring them inside. 

 

As I was walking, I found a completely new and closed bottle of rum hiding behind the tree. I stopped in my tracks and stared at it for a few seconds before picking it up. I then asked myself the same question.. ""Was it worth it?"" before opening it up and smelling the booze a few times. I told myself that I being upset right now wasn't a good enough reason to throw away all my progress. I ended up pouring an extremely small amount into the cap and took the tiniest sip. I got the same familiar burn in my throat, the hairs on my arms rose, I got goosebumps from it like I always do but this time.. I spit it out. I closed the bottle, put it back, and went along my way. I thought about it for hours and knew that I made the right choice because I didn't even want to drink. I feel bad for opening someone elses random bottle they hid and I hope they'll forgive me if they read this and I'm also sorry about this extremely long winded rant but its a few days before Halloween which has always been a blackout holiday for me and I have something to say to everyone else partying in NYC as well as to myself..

Apologies, I am not a fluent writer, and might struggle to get my message across.

I want to ask, how did you guys get through the first few weeks/months of sobriety when you have functions/events planned that you would normally drink at?

I have a sports tournament coming up next weekend that is religiously coupled with a multitude of beers, staying out late etc. I am carrying an injury that I will say is the reason I am not drinking, as I can't bring myself to say I am not drinking just for the sake of sobriety. Was there a certain period of sober time that passed before you found it easy to tell others you are sober?

I am also embarrassed/afraid to tell my friends I want to be sober. My friends aren't alcoholics, but we would normally get together once a month roughly and have plenty of drinks. They will find it weird that I don't want to drink anymore, and I'm sure they would accept my decision, but I am scared to tell them for fear of their reaction. Any advice/

It's been 8 1/2 months since my last drink (sobriety date is 2/10/19). I've been to rehab 5 times in my life and this is the longest I've ever stayed sober.

Recently several people have made comments to me indicating that they think I am at risk for relapse- my mother in particular. She has repeatedly gone out of her way to bring up that a relapse would mean I would be (permanently) barred from Thanksgiving, Christmas, ect. My sponsor is on a long trip and has been difficult to get in touch with. My best friend relapsed on marijuana last weekend after 14 months of sobriety. 

The fucked up thing is, I have been thinking about drinking. I'm on Antabuse long-term, so I am at no immediate risk of picking up. But I've been fantasizing about stopping Antabuse, and having a bunch of strong cocktails and maybe some beers after. On my walk today, I stopped outside a restaurant to look at the cocktail menu. I went into a liquor store to buy a Diet Coke. 

I don't want to relapse. Selfishly, I don't want to lose everything, and unselfishly, I don't want to negatively affect people in my life. But I can't stop thinking about drinking. I was in treatment the first 3 months of this sobriety- I had a rough time between 90 and 120 days, but then between 4 and 6 months, I thought very little about drinking.

It didn’t make anything more fun, I didn’t get drunk, and I did leave the party early because I didn’t want to fuck up what I’ve been trying to achieve. I don’t feel bad about it, since I righted my wrong in the moment and went home. 

Anyhow last night went to a halloween party that I was quite excited for, and I didn’t drink at all. I also had pretty high level anxiety and had to go outside for a breather a few times to calm some panicky feelings. It wasn’t drinking- it was having to socialise with strangers without alcohol. Usually when I’ve got to make small talk with people at a party I’ll be tipsy and the conversation flows out of me- though it’s not always interesting I did feel calm and confident. Anyhow I tried to push through, drank my soda water, and I just couldn’t. I wasn’t worried I would drink because I didn’t really want to (I mean half of me did- there were several bottles of fantastic cold champagne flowing and alcoholic me wanted to drink it straight from the bottle but the other half didn’t want to deal with all the negative consequences, and I knew I wasn’t going to do it) but I had trouble focusing on conversations and couldn’t respond well to other people. It was really weird. I said goodbye to friends and left early with my SO and it was totally fine, just felt bizarre. 

This evening I went for dinner with 6 friends and had a blast. Didn’t feel the need to drink a drop. Our bill was half the price of everyone else’s because my SO only had one drink and I had water- what a perk! 

Sometimes I feel like I’m writing in a diary a bit on SD, and I’m sorry if it seems a little self centred. I find I learn so much from other peoples responses and posts, I just thought I’d throw this on here today. I’m feeling good about my choices, and terrible about that anxiety. I’m also wondering if I’m finally at an age where I can just not want to go to parties anymore and that’s ok. I like spending time with friends, and am so lucky to be an adult with close friendships, and whose friends are supportive and non judgemental. 

I’ll always be an alcoholic, but if I keep really forcing myself to think about my actions and my feelings, and dissecting stuff like this, I hope one day I won’t have to struggle with every freaking fibre of my being to not drink. What a relaxing f*cking day THAT will be.

It was a huge milestone for me. Triple digits. This is coming from a guy who just a few years ago was vomiting on the floor and urinating in bed because of binge drinking. Well, 10 days later, I am still sober. I'm trying for 6 months. That's my new goal. 

Two days ago, I was having a bad day. I felt exhausted, a bit depressed, not good. So many times in the past I took the easy way out by just drinking and numbing my mind. I did not make this mistake this time. One of the most important life lessons I have learned is that it's much better to suffer a little bit now in exchange for years of success and joy. Enough with satisfying immediate cravings. We both know that if I had drank that day, I would have felt twice as worse the next day. Not only that, it takes me something like two weeks to return to my baseline emotions and baseline sleep after a binge.

99% of the time I have no cravings or desire to drink. It's not fun. It's work. It's awful sleep and raging heartburn. 

So I just took a nap for one hour, then I lifted weights and did ab crunches while listening to lively uplifting music. Then I played Red Dead Redemption 2 for a couple hours. I'm done with hangovers, drunk Facebook rants, and ruined sleep. 
I quite enjoy being sober now, even on a bad day.",17

the host had a rule of “costume or take 10 shots”. i politely declined and said “i don’t drink anymore :)” she was very understanding and handed me a flavored perrier.

but this past week, i’ve been considering bringing drinking back into my life, testing an edge, as a hedonistic type of pleasure in terms of flavors and adding to experiences.

last night, i gave into peer pressure and took a shot of silver sauza with my partner. i think i wanted to help soothe us both. i immediate regretted it the second someone asked about my sobriety. i felt like a liar. it didn’t add on to my experience. i was not enjoying the personality that was coming out of me. and it was mixing with my CBD:THC oil weird, lol.

i’m currently reevaluating my values when it comes to why i decided to quit. it may have not been the right environment to try to reintroduce drinking as an “experience”.

Two years ago I stopped for six weeks with the help of Naltrexone, but then I stopped taking it and at Christmas dinner 2016 I had a glass of wine or several.

My drinking ramped up, I started drinking all day on the weekends, sneaking them in before breakfast if I knew we were going out somewhere that had bloody mary's and therefore no one would notice, having a secret stash in the recycle bin, going to events where I knew there'd be drinking just so I could have an excuse to drink, having a few \*before\* going to beer fest, etc, but I still made it to work every day and was mostly productive.  On vacations I was a disaster and drank so much I was barely functional, in hindsight it was embarrassing.  I was probably at about 10-15 drinks most days around a year and a half ago.

About 10 months ago my dog got cancer in one toe, then another, and ultimately lost one rear leg.  I started working at home more and drinking more (all day).  A few months ago the cancer returned in the other rear foot and we had to make the decision to put him down.  He was not quite 10.  As he went downhill, so did I, and by the time his cancer returned I was working at home almost every day, drinking all day, up to 15 or 20, plus a can of wine (or two) if I went to the store, shots whenever I had the option, stopping by the bar for a double whiskey before meeting people for happy hour, or whatever.  I tried to taper, I'd get down to maybe 6 by Wednesday and then Thursday would come and that was the start of the weekend for me.  I was sweating all night, barely sleeping, dry heaving in the morning, shaking until I had at least 3 or 4, leaving work early on the days I did go in so I could stop shaking and sweating.

By the time he died I was dry heaving out front on the sidewalk trying to help him go to the bathroom in the morning (he was having trouble walking), how fucking shitty is that?

I went to the doctor who recommended inpatient detox because obviously I couldn't stop on my own and was at this point at risk of major withdrawal problems.

On the day I checked in to detox I had two White Claws in the morning so I could stop dry heaving and shaking, the last at 9:29 AM, and blew a .197 at noon!!

I was in detox for 4 days, and it was unbelievable, truly a miracle of modern medicine.  All of the things that scared me back to alcohol were managed away and I am sober.  I am back on Naltrexone to help reduce cravings (the recommended use of it is different in the US and Europe) and since I don't have any I'm guessing it's working the way it's supposed to, but I'm not going to stop to test it out...

For those of you having trouble stopping like I did, go to the doctor, inpatient or outpatient, medical detox can get you a head start like you wouldn't believe.

It's day 8, my last drink was 10/19/2019 at 9:29 AM, and I feel almost normal, I literally can't believe it.

I’m a grey-area drinker who has been trying to get sober for over a year now. I can’t seem to get past 21 days, and I’m tired of feeling like a failure. 

By grey area drinker, I mean that I can moderate for a week or two (like 3-5 drinks in a week) but I’m quickly back to drinking every night. No more than 3 a night, but boy that adds up quick. 

Then there are the occasional weekends when I go off the deep end. 

All of this really doesn’t help my anxiety and depression. My dad is an alcoholic in denial and I don’t want to end up like him. I know I have the itch when I start drinking for more more more. 

I tried to go to AA earlier this summer, but because my drinking is “normal” I wasn’t able to fully integrate it into my life. I never felt like I was bad enough to be there, I hated getting called on because I felt like a voyeur, like I didn’t belong. My boyfriend doesn’t like AA as a concept so he wasn’t very supportive, and I had a hard time prioritizing meetings instead of spending time with him. Such a lame excuse. Now I feel so guilty for ghosting my sponsor that I don’t want to go back. 

So I’ve been drinking again for the past few months and I just want to be done, but I can’t seem to find the motivation I’ve had in the past. It’s like I’ve said “I’m going to quit drinking” so many times that it’s lost it’s meaning.

My friend let me know he was going to rehab. He's always been an asshole when drunk. Picking fights with people. Insulting them to get a rise. But I'm beginning to realize he just doesn't give a fuck. All he cares about is getting laid.

I went to see him last night to talk with him and let him know I support him. I also asked a few questions. I asked if he wanted to go. He said he did and needed to learn not to drink. He drinks a liter of vodka a day. He knows it's not good and wants to save money. I offered to go to meetings with him and he started to laugh and say he's not going to go to meetings. 

He asked if I was ever in rehab and I said no but I was in the psych ward. He called me a weirdo and when I gave him a look, he just laughed. He then tried to get me to drink for a last hoorah. It was so stupid. I wasn't even tempted but got pretty annoyed when he begged me. 

Fuck all that. It was stupid. Later, after I left, he texted me that he wanted to kiss me but decided not to even try because he would get rejected. Damn straight I would

I've lost hope in humanity. I actually cared about this idiot. If he truly cared about himself or me he wouldn't have said what he did last night. That's fine. He's on his own journey in life. I imagine he will relapse after he gets out and will continue to try to persue me. I dont find this kind of behavior attractive. I'm just done.",7
2019-10-27 13:12:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dnwe1w/different_stages_share_your_experiences/,"Different Stages, share your experiences","I'm sober for half a year today. I made my decision after an incident where I got blackout drunk and grieved a friend very badly and which I immediately regretted the next day. It was just the culmination of problems, though, I had been drinking more and more over the past months.

When I made my decision this subreddit was an incredible help: I felt less lonely in my decision and reading from others who had a problem and managed to stay sober for longer periods of time made me much more confident that I could do it as well. I'm glad to say that I don't feel the urge to visit this place anymore, because not drinking is something about me that I rarely question anymore.

I wonder how the stages of withdrawal went for others, for me it went as follows:

**First three months**

There was no physical dependency, so luckily there was no problem in that area.
First I had to conquer the daily habit of getting alcohol at the supermarket (daily because whatever I bought, I would drink the same night). It was hard, but I was confident in my decision, because I did not want to do the horrible stuff I had done again.
Harder was the urge to drink when I felt bad, I had been so used to drinking to deal with my emotions: ""Feeling bad? I want a drink."" ""Feeling good? Better celebrate with a drink."" So having to face my emotions straight on and sober was tough. But again, the motivation that I didn't want to do shitty things like I had done ever again was really strong.

A different thing altogether was getting rid of my people-pleasing mentality, I was very susceptible to (perceived) group pressure. I don't like to draw attention to myself, and I thought that people would make a fuss out of me not drinking anymore. Luckily, friends and family have been very supportive and nobody ever pushed me to drink.
The grieved person and aren't in contact much anymore (because logistic reasons and also deliberately) and I told her that I quit drinking and that that moment was the trigger only a few days ago. She's the only one I've told about the actual trigger. I didn't want to tell her sooner that I had quit drinking because I wanted to be confident I wouldn't relapse soon and also because I didn't want it to sound like an excuse for my behavior. The fact is that when I decided to drink I was sober and I even knew it was likely that I'd do really stupid things, so I'm still 100% responsible for what I did when blackout drunk.

Going against the assumed expectations of others, and learning that what I think they expect of me is probably wrong, together with keeping my back straight and not being ashamed of saying ""no"" to a drink, have probably been the biggest lessons I've learned from sobriety.

Counting days (literal tick marks on a notepad) was a big motivator for me. It gave me a sense of pride and accomplishment to see the counter go up. First in days, then in weeks, and now in months.

**3-6 Months**

The past few months the urges to drink have appeared only rarely. When they did appear what kept me from giving my sense of pride in keeping it up for so long already and the realization that the failure of a relapse would give me grief for much longer than whatever was bothering me in that moment.

The thought I have to fight against the most these days is ""You've done it for so long now, you'll be fine if you drink this one (special) night."" It can be sneaky and tempting, but I draw strength from the previous point: after succeeding for so long, I really don't want to screw it up.

Do say how it went for you and maybe you had other temptations, perhaps some that only popped up later than after 6 months?",13

But then I always have to tell them why-- it's because I knew I had to quit for a good 10 years before I actually did it.  The only difference between myself and the people who try over and over again to quit is that I was too afraid to try it before.  I ""knew"" that I couldn't quit.  I had resigned myself to a life of drug and alcohol consumption, feeling like shit every day, and just accepting the fact that I was a ""partier"" that had no control.  I was afraid that if I ever tried and failed, that it would just reinforce my belief that I couldn't do it.  So after years of trying to ""cut back"" and ""moderate"" and ""take breaks"" to ""reset my brain"" (or whatever bullshit I told myself), I FINALLY realized that the life I was living was full of way more cons than pros and there was no more space for drugs and alcohol in it.  My only point here is that I'm so impressed with all of you who keep trying, even when it doesn't stick the first time (or second, or third...).  I was too afraid to do that and I wasted a good 10 years of continuing to drink.  Maybe it doesn't take the first time, but at some point it will (one way or another).  You never know when your tipping point will be.  You never know when will be the last time you try.  Maybe it'll be THIS TIME.  Don't be like me.  Don't be afraid to try.",2

All the other house members have been (I know cos they mentioned it, I didn't say anything), and it's just so upsetting and awkward. I can't stay in when they're all drinking and having a great time, when I won't be able to stop thinking about all the emotional abuse I've suffered from these people, and now they'll be in my house.

I'm looking at places I could crash, like hotels and such, but it's just very upsetting. I can't even tell the other housemates about this as I don't want to take this away from the Party-thrower and cause drama. AA teaches us to be the better person, and boy is this testing.

2019-10-27 09:51:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dnthxg/iwndwyt/,IWNDWYT,"Hi, first post on this sub...

Roughly year ago today I started detoxing from caffeine, and after working down to no caff, have been enjoying the mental health benefits.

But up until now I’ve continued to drink. I know that if my life has improved without coffee, it could improve tenfold without booze. I’ve experimented with periods of sobriety before, the longest being six weeks.

I know from experience that it makes me happier and makes my life more manageable. I just haven’t been able to fully commit, and reflecting on this has led me to believe it’s largely because of the social pressure. 

When you meet a friend or colleague for coffee, you’re not often sitting down for multiple coffees  — that moment of saying no comes once and then it passes. 

Drinking engagements are more difficult to wrap my head around because they take so many shapes and forms. People constantly asking you if you want/need a drink. So many options to choose from - forget latte vs cold brew. You’ve got beer, wine, mixed drinks, shots, and I like the taste of all of them. 

I’ve also sometimes believed the lie that alcohol helps with my social anxiety. Maybe it does in the moment, but it soon wears off and the next day I’m in a deep funk, believing that everyone hates me. 

Most of all, I don’t *want* to live a different lifestyle than other people and to be constantly vigilant. I’d love to go with the flow and have it not be a big deal to have a drink or a few. 

But if I’m being honest with myself, for me it is a deeply big deal. I can’t snap my fingers and turn into a person who is okay with drinking. It makes me unhappy enough that I need to stop. That’s the bottom line. 

Friends with good intentions tell me I’m being “too hard on myself,” and that with moderation, I’ll be fine. 

I’ve even had therapists not take me seriously when I’ve brought up the idea of quitting. They’ve made me feel crazy for wanting to take things to that “extreme.” 

I like wine. I like beer. I don’t like how they make me feel. Like breaking up with a romantic partner, I’m sad to see them go, even if they’re not right for me. Part of me doesn’t know what I’ll do without them in my life. 

I’m also scared – scared of doing things that others might judge. I’m scared to reach my full potential and scared of the disappointments that I will still inevitably experience. 

But by this time next year, I could be in a better place – an even better place than since this time last year. I handled last year’s challenge so let’s see what else I can do.",8

But, in any case, that feels like an important corner to turn...that while sometimes I still want to drink I no longer want to feel drunk. And more importantly, the mental health improvements have been huge. There is no denying my anxiety has dropped to record low levels. I had no idea I was making myself sick...it is crazy!

Trips to Poland used to be a carte blanche to get royally messed up and drunk, and this, a year ago, would have been the perfect excuse to drink myself into a dark hole I'd have to slowly crawl out of.

Really feel like a drink and cant imagine a lifetime without having one. I hear its PAWS so I am working through it. Not going to drink today and that is that. 

Anyway, that’s not why I am posting.....What is really weird is that I have huge cravings to smoke now! I gave up cigarettes over 20 years ago and haven’t really ever thought about it since. But this evening I had a massive craving to smoke. Has anyone else gone through something like this? 

Is this just further proof that my body/mind is quite literally hell bent on self destruction through whatever means necessary:)",6

I’m looking for support, a community that I can turn to to help me over the habit of daily drinking. I believe I can do it but I can’t do it alone. I need to be able to turn to someone when the inevitable urge to pour a glass of wine hits in the early afternoon. I can hold that urge back until 6, and then easily put away a bottle of wine. Everyday. 

When I hear other people’s stories my drinking doesn’t feel like a catastrophic, chaotic nightmare, but it is the final piece of a history of addiction. I feel like even though I’ve worked so hard to raise my own awareness, grow into self responsibility, and be a decent human in all my relationships, the daily drip feed of alcohol is keeping me from realising my potential. 

I want joy, I want health, I want to be proud of myself and the example I set for my children. Right now I’m tired of the cycle, worn out with anger and frustration,  disgusted that I consciously choose to waste a bit more of my life everyday.

I’ve been abusing alcohol most of my life. I was born with a birth defect on my left hand and I always felt bad about it. I let it make me feel less than everyone else. 
When I got older I used alcohol to make myself feel better about myself because I thought people liked me better with it.
I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, I have manic depressive mood swings where it feels like I’m being crushed under self doubt and I’m so sure I’m the worst person. I had one at work yesterday, it was followed by a manic high state where I was fun and bubbly but running a mile a minute and frantic. 
Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. 
It made me feel like being weird was acceptable on that day. 
I’ve drank heavily every year at this time and even tho  it was excessive it felt ok because that’s what people did I thought. 
This is the first time I’m not drinking and I can’t help but want to feel differently than I do. Like I’m not enjoying myself because I don’t have it. 
Im scared to cave because I don’t think I’ll be able to control what happens. Or pick up the pieces tomorrow. Im at a Halloween party where people will drink in excess and I keep thinking I could go to some random bar and drink where no one knows I’m sober. 
I’m just feeling weak and unsure of myself I could use some support.",4

It was interesting seeing how much of a mess some people were. Grooms sister was puking in the bathroom. Brides dad was absolutely plastered. Didn't have the balls to hit the dancefloor sober but I wasn't with a date so meh. Not a biggie. 

It was definitely an interesting experience all together but I think the fact that I was able to limit myself to that one shot was pretty interesting.

I just got out of a 45 day treatment center a few weeks ago.  The program had a big focus on meditation and mindfulness as well as the 12 steps.  It was the best thing I’ve ever done for myself.  When I left treatment, I was feeling so motivated, excited, and ready to take on life sober.  I’m originally from Alabama, and went to treatment in Texas, and am now in a sober living out here.  

I’m lucky to have found a decent paying job that I start on Monday.  However, the last few weeks since leaving treatment I’ve mostly just slept and watched Netflix.  I have been attending around 5 meetings a week.  Have gotten a sponsor and meet with him a couple of times.

I guess I just had some hopes for myself leaving treatment.  I had a desire to have a regular daily schedule (something I have always struggled with) with going to sleep and waking up at the same time everyday, meditation, exercise, reading, eating healthy, etc.  but I’ve just fallen back into old habits, and have fell back into misery, shame, depression, etc.

One of my biggest motivators for getting sober was my mental health.  I’ve always struggled with suicidal ideation, anxiety, and problems with explosive rage.  So I’m happy to be sober, and I really feel like I’ve been able to pierce through my anger and resentment and develop a new relationship with these feelings, so they don’t have to control my behavior anymore.

I guess I’m just feeling lonely and lost out here, away from my hometown, with no real friends out here.  I’m not even sure why I’m posting this right now, maybe just to vent.

Anyway, y’all are awesome.  It’s takes so much courage to move forward with your life sober.  I’m proud of all of you.",10

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up and then try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Today was horrendous. My job is good, and most of the time I love the people, but today some unknown villain made a point to shit in everyone's cheerios. The chef - who I generally love so very dearly and who has been a great support in my sobriety - was a raging fucking cocksucker, having gotten everyone's stomach in knots of anxiety and anger within half an hour of being there. 

I didn't hold it together. For the first time in a long time I bit back; screamed and cussed and stomped and made my anger clearly known. I haven't done that in a long while. I was really bad when I was drinking, and I was unbearable (to myself and everyone around me) when I was abstaining from drinking without working a program of recovery. When I started actually living the principles of AA, all that reactionary anger just started working itself out. There are a dozen things I can do, either quietly in my head or physically or out loud, to keep a sense of peace with me even when shit's hitting the fan. My life has been so peaceful the last eight months. 

And today was a cocksucker. Just an absolute whammy of a fucking shitshow circus of resentment and screaming and stomping egos. It was awful, and I didn't react how I'd have liked to, but God, just - what a relief that I don't want to drink over it. It used to feel like victory when I got on the other side of a day like today and managed to wrestle with the want to have a drink and not succumb. It's just such a relief that I don't want to drink. I'm not wrestling with anything except a little leftover hurt from the way I was spoken to by someone that I genuinely love and admire. 

Even that, though - tomorrow is another day. I probably hurt his feelings, too, and it doesn't make my skin crawl to think that I'll make an apology. I don't think, in any reach of reality, that I did anything to deserve the day that I had, that I deserved in any way the way I was treated, and I just... it just isn't that important to carry the anger with me. I'll apologize for how I reacted, and hopefully he'll acknowledge his assholery. If he doesn't, that's his resentment to carry. 

Today was awful -- the first part of today was awful -- but it feels really damn good to not be overwhelmed by it. I have the rest of the evening to cook a comfort meal and get some good sleep. I'll clean up my side of the street tomorrow and be relieved of any burden of resentment, and life will go on.

My mother has had a problem for 4 decades. She is no where near sober, nor do I think she wants to be. I never wanted to be either, until I drank too much after my second was born and passed out while my husband was at work (called my husband before passing out and told him to come home NOW...babies were fine). That was 4 months ago.
Since then I've drank but never to that point...I don't know why I'm rambling. Just wondering if others here have parents who have stopped or not stopped, and how that effects you and your sobriety? My biggest fear is becoming my mother and I don't want to drink because I do not want my boys to grow up like I did- with an absent, toxic mother.",1

2019-10-26 16:55:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dnjmry/feeling_so_stuck_and_left_behind/,Feeling so stuck. And left behind.,"I'm a 35 year old woman and I feel like an empty shell. I still live in a studio apartment. I'm not married. No kids. No relationship over a year for a very long time. I'm an executive at a company but don't feel particularly good at my job. I have a few close friends but mostly a wide network of casual acquaintances made through work. No one I can show the full extent of my damage to without the fear of them withdrawing, or at the very least thinking: wow, what a wreck.

I'm the only child of two parents who were very abused themselves. They never hit me. But nothing I did was ever quite right or good enough. I poured myself into school because it was the one thing I could do, seemingly. Went to an ivy league school but was a loner the whole time. The only times I wasn't was when alcohol was involved. It's been my dark passenger ever since. My therapist has called me starved for love more than once. And I do feel that way. I apologize 20 times a day for taking up any space at all. I spiral out with worry over saying the wrong thing or turning people off. I'm panicked that I come across as weird or awful or unlikable even though I work my ass off to be charming, inquisitive, and helpful to everyone. 

Then, until 6 days ago, I'd binge drink bottles of wine by myself once a week, trashing my weekends even though I needed to do work or see people. It's been a secret only evident in how tired i am all the time, my dry skin and bloodshot eyes. My unpredictable irritability. The constant anxiety of being behind and not being able to self care in the simplest of ways - the dentist, laundry, drinking enough water.

If you asked one of my friends, they'd tell you that I'm talented and well known in my industry, sweet and thoughtful (despite the horrible insecurity that they've all seen at some point). Most of my closest friends think I quit drinking, because I tried and succeeded for 6 months, and I told no one that I relapsed. I was so ashamed and embarrassed. They do not see the full extent of the twisted, messy, maze I've built for myself. I have a therapist who doesn't even seem to fully comprehend it. 

I'm writing this here because I don't know how to find my way out of the maze. I need to be honest with someone, somewhere. Now all my friends are married or have kids. They are buying houses and getting promotions. I'm standing still and no one knows exactly why. It's uncomfortable for them to watch, much less talk about. They want the light and fun and casual me. The unburdening version. And yet, here I am at the bottom of a well (mixing my metaphors on top of everything else!) so far behind, so incapable of a romantic relationship, so self loathing, and most of all, so depleted that I have no energy to even consider the climb out.

I want to stop drinking this time. I've identified that as the least I can do for myself. But I also wonder if anyone here can relate? Has anyone here successfully untangled a life so knotted, thorny, and disappointing this late in the game? Is change at this juncture even still possible?

I'd love your thoughts.",88

2019-10-26 16:22:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dnj7oo/divorce_in_recovery/,Divorce in Recovery,"When I married my husband he had 10 years sober. I had 2. We had been friends for a few years and I had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship after hitting my 1 year mark. The relationship between me and my husband was awesome. We went to meetings, we were sponsors, I was independent and working and he was as well. It was the happiest I had ever been.
Before we celebrated our thrid year of marriage he relapsed. Not long after, I relapsed as well. We spent the next 2 years spiraling downward until we lost everything. Finally in May, we both went back to treatment and have been sober since.
A few days ago he told me our relationship was toxic and we should take a week off from each other. He lives in a halfway house and I live with my father. He said we shouldn't speak or see each other for a week and then we can discuss our relationship more rationally. I am devastated.
I set up appointments with a counselor who works with alcoholics and addicts, I have a good support system that includes my parents and my sponsor, and I go to 4-5 meetings a week. But I don't know what to do. 
I don't believe our relationship can recover from this. I don't think I can trust him if he can go for a week without seeing or speaking to me and be okay. Especially since there was nothing that happened to spark this sudden decision. We lived apart but we were makng it work. Of course we both got emotional at times, but nothing that would cause such a drastic change. 
I am on day 3 and we have spoken a few times but today is the first day I haven't called or texted. I am treating it like I would if I had relapsed. Calling my sponosr when I want to call him, taking it one day at a time. I am afraid this is the end. Even if he decides he wants to stay together, I don't know if I will want that. I am scared and confused and angry. 
Has anyone dealt with something similar? How do you deal with divorce in recovery? What can I do for myself? Should I stay married to him after this?
Sorry for the long post.

EDIT: 10/28 He informed me this morning that he wanted a divorce. Then took it back and said he needed to call his sponsor. I told him that I couldn't go a week in weird limbo. I graduate college in December and I plan to move out of state. If he wants a divorce, he can file for one but I'm not playing this weird game anymore. I will keep you posted.",6

I woke up miserable, hungover and feeling sentenced to another day of my bleak existence, filled with shame and regret over my lack of self control. I was flushed and sweaty, and I could smell the sins of last night oozing from my pores. My hands weren’t shaking today, so I had that going for me. That had begun to happen more and more often by the end. I had been a lousy husband and father for some time now. I was physically present, but not really there. Despite keeping up outward appearances of success and happiness, I was not doing well. I was increasingly plagued by dark thoughts of my own death. I was wanting alcohol less and less, but drinking it more and more. I was desperate.Standing on a street corner, I looked at a piece of paper with the date on it. 10/26/2018 in large bold font. I thought to myself. “Today could be a new beginning” and quickly dismissed the notion. I didn’t deserve to be happy. 

However I didn’t drink that day or the next, this was extremely rare and usually took a great deal of effort to go a single day without alcohol. I began to think, never in my adult life had I not been a drinker. It was at least worth a shot right? I was already miserable, so If nothing changed I could always drink again. Slowly things got better. I started sleeping decent. I no longer said things I didn’t mean, or remember. Small improvements began to snowball into bigger ones. Joy returned to my family life. I laughed like I did as an innocent kid. My problems all of the sudden felt much more manageable. 

I began a meditation practice, I sought out like minded sober people and listened to what they had to say. I read books, listened to podcasts, and journaled. Somewhere along the way, I realized my new life bore little resemblance to my old one. I was grateful for what I had, and I strived for wisdom and joy instead of superiority and pleasure. Quitting drinking was the first domino, the first step of this journey of personal and spiritual growth.

Wether you have been sober for 100 minutes or 100 years, we are all on this journey together. It’s not you can do this, but YOU ARE DOING THIS. Even if you are struggling, you are here now, which means you are walking the path. I’m not an expert on anything, but this I know. The Universe threw me a life ring when I was drowning, and all I did was hang on. 

There are no mountain tops in sobriety, but this seems like a good place to enjoy the view for a moment. I love you all 🙏🏻",850

I understand that alcohol does nothing but give me terrible anxiety, worry, guilt, regret, and shame. I've binged every weekend this month. My pattern is usually this - I wake up on Monday fully intending to quit, my resolve is 100%, I'm listening to This Naked Mind and other audiobooks about alcoholism, yet on Friday night I still find myself in the bar with friends drinking, smiling on the outside to make everyone think I'm happy, but dying on the inside knowing that I've broken another promise to myself, feeding myself a toxic substance that is giving me crippling anxiety and depression and destroying the quality of my life. 

Any tips on how I can make it through a weekend sober? I feel like if I can just get that one first win, one sober weekend, I can start to get a foothold on this thing.

We went to a big Halloween house party and there was a lot of drinking of course, beer pong the works... 10pm people were turning it up fast, lots of jello shots etc. We drove 45min+ to get there and I was happy being the DD for my friend to get her home safe. Then a guy walked in with 6 cases of liquor I kid you not, these people were getting wild. I usually would have been the life of the party and getting pretty crazy mind you I hold myself well I was never the blackout guy except on the rarest of occasions. 

My point is, it was so hard to socialize because I only knew 2-3 people and being sober makes it hard for me to just start up and maintain fun random conversations at parties. I figured it out though and managed to chat and get along with lots of these party animals for 3-4 hours. I'm happy I was only drinking water then made a mocktail out of all the crazy mixers they had. It is possible to have fun at parties and be sober.

Getting rid of my wine collection for good.,"So I now I have over one year under my belt.  My program is working for me even though I have had the delusion that at some point I will be able to drink like normal people.  When I quit, it was originally for a year.  I entered an intensive outpatient treatment program to quit.  Within days, I realized I was an alcoholic that hadn’t reached a low bottom.  In other words, I had the disease, but caught it in time so I wouldn’t lose my job, home, bank account, etc.  as each week rolled by, I became more aware of my alcoholism and my life improved.  The best rewards were no more hangovers; more energy and I could get things done.  Nevertheless, I had the delusion I could drink normally again.

I planned for a relapse.  I planned to return to “drinking like a gentleman”.  Therefore, I kept my small wine collection.  On my first anniversary something clicked.  A close friend of ours was having a dinner party.  I love him and his husband.  The know I am in recovery.  I called him to see if I could bring a few of my best bottles to their dinner party.  He was OK with it.

Last night, was the dinner party.  I was the only one not drinking.  Frankly some of the guests were very pretentious about their wine, clothes and travel.  They were in the minority.  After hearing one of them go on and on about various wines and ports over dinner, I realized much of my desire to drink like a gentleman was in order to fit in with shallow talk and snobbishness.  Although I love my hosts, some of their guests and the conversation were really boring.  I then realized I had been a boring pretentious wine snob during by drinking days.  I love having sober insight.  I also have greater appreciation for my brothers and sisters in sobriety.

Everyone enjoyed their wine and port.  A few were slurring their words.  I left when I had enough.  For the first time I was comfortable with the idea that I will never dip into my wine collection ever as I am slowly giving bottles away to my friends.  I feel great about it.

(Including blocking him on my cell phone)  

I went to the place I've been going off and on for over a year, and I always wondered why some would comment that it's too wild there. Too relaxed, not structured enough. I mean, I'm all for fairness and logic but completely and entirely structured can get ... boring and stiff. So after a few months off I went to a late friday night meeting. 

Upon arrival, there was one person there. And I had been dropped off, so it's not like I could turn around and leave. Guy had already seen me and I didn't want to be totally rude and just disappear, so I stayed. An other couple came in a few minutes later. 

While he started off the meeting fairly typically, including a short story from the big book, after that it went off the rails. I'm used to that, to a degree. We do follow the no cross talk rules, (most of the time) and all that, but this was out of control. I was trying to share what I'd gone through the last few months (After them asking me) and they all kept interrupting me. Telling me what to do. Being rude about it. Condescending as HELL. I mean every single thing I said, they basically argued it. I know nothing and they know everything. Making fun of me, being passive aggressive, etc. 

You know, I used to enjoy meetings, but since this particular guy has become more active in the local meetings I frequent, it's a lot harder to even want to go. He's a know it all. Literally. He will tell you up front that he thinks he's better than everyone else. That he \*knows\* he's better than everyone else. That he's always right, almost never wrong. And now he's chairing?

Not to be mean, but it's no damn wonder that nobody shows up to his meetings. I seriously can't get over how big of a jerk he was last night. And egging on the other couple that was there, making me feel like I was stupid and worthless, and knew absolutely nothing about anything. Like I haven't been sitting around those tables for 2 years. 

I'm sorry, I really needed to vent about that. Because I did relapse, and I do want to get back on and stay on the wagon. And when I mentioned detox? Oh ho! Why on earth would I need that? I dont need that, this guy did it by himself locking himself in his parents spare room. Great, good for you! But I have a ton of health problems and I'm not willing to risk a seizure, stroke, or whatever other part of alcohol withdrawal can cause. I've been dopesick, I know how miserable it is, and I know that medically assisted detox is the way to go. 

And then the, well why not just go to rehab? Just go up there, they have to take you.  Um, yeah, no they don't. I tried that already. Two nights ago. Went to the ER shit faced so they would take me for detox. They basically kicked me out of there and I'm still no closer to getting into a rehab. I have a ton of calls to make, and potentially some favors to call in. 

Overall, I guess... Just.. keep going back. Just because one meeting was utter shite, doesn't mean they will all be. Just because you met a couple cunts at one meeting, doesn't mean you won't meet genuinely nice and caring people elsewhere. I mean these people were straight up cult like. Ugh. Just retelling it has given me a headache.

Edit 1. Based on some of the responses here (which I'm grateful for) I will be looking for the higher up for that location. This person really really should not be chairing. Like I said, I've been around the tables over 2 years. I took a break for a few months but I know that this isn't how meetings should be run. 

It's one thing to chair, it's something else entirely to insist that someone is wrong and that their plans can't possibly become reality. 

Thanks again for all the input!",27

On top of that, I bonused this month in my pay. Job kinda sucks but God it feels good when they just slap an extra $400 on your paycheck. I get to pay off my credit card because of that. Hell yeah. 

Paying my credit card means I'm as far as finding a nice place from getting out of my parents place, which is long overdue.

I started the morning feeling a craving for a drink. I ignored it and tried to keep busy and distracted as best I could. At one point I even drove into town to do some grocery shopping, making sure to avoid the street with all the liquor stores. But after returning home the craving was stronger and I started arguing with myself. “Just one drink won’t kill you.” “It’s been a rough week you deserve a drink to relax.” “It will help with your anxiety.”… etc etc. Long story short, I caved in and drove back into town to buy a bottle. The rest of that day went like a train wreck in slow motion. I took a drink and the voice was gone but so was my will to stop drinking until that bottle was empty. 

This week I’m not listening to that voice, instead I’m remembering. I’m remembering all the reasons I can’t have a drink. Even if I could just have one drink today it would only fuel that damn voice and lead to another drink and another. My last relapse ended with an overnight binge and several days of being physically sick and disgusted with myself. My will is not stronger today but maybe I’m just a bit smarter.

That day went south the moment I listened to the thought that I have some level of self-control with alcohol. I know better now and I’m determined to never forget that. The buzz and euphoria that comes with drinking doesn’t last and It is not worth risking another relapse. After all, how many can I have before I lose the will to fight my way back out and that is a scary thought. 

I will not drink with you today.

After a brutal, marriage ending betrayal, I used the only coping skill I had- drinking. I lost myself. I would come home from work, pour wine, feel sad and lonely, call/text people, forget my conversations and pass out. I was simply stuck for about a year, and the only thing going for me was my job, and even that I would lose if I stayed on the same path. I finally had enough of being lost. I was hurting everyone around me, and eventually my drinking was going to lead to my suicide. The suicide hotline could have been on speed dial. I was ready to go.

5 months and 5 days ago, I called my mom and said, “Mom, I’m an alcoholic.” She replied, “I know, sweetheart. I know.” It’s in my family- but it’s always been a little dark secret that no one will ever change. I was done with that. I wasn’t going to let my story end here. I was sick of hurting others. Myself? Still didn’t care about. But I just wanted to stop hurting people with my drunken words.

This sub, AA, IOP, exercise, meditation/prayer and friends along the way have kept me sober. I’m not giving up now! I just put the progress pictures together for the first time this morning and almost cried. I’m getting my life back.

Stress was building and I had to make this work.  I had no choice.  I refuse to fail and I was not going to lose my family.  
I basically told myself this as I was drinking.  By myself.  In the dark.  In my bedroom.  On Wednesday night.  That had been my norm for longer than I would like to admit.  It still hurts.  My wife and oldest daughter knew, maybe a close family friend or 2.  Prolly more, prolly everyone.  I wasnt fooling anyone.  
So, that night, I said, ""Fuck it, I am done.""  Now, I have said this many times, if I have said this once, I have said it a million times.  But I convinced myself I needed to change.  If I don't, I fail.  I have seen alcohol up close and personal, what it has done to me, what it has done to others.  Its taken family, jobs, money, time and life.

I honestly never drank to such excess I couldn’t function, or risked losing a job, or anything like that. But when I did drink, I NEVER could stop with just a beer or cocktail. I’d drink til I was buzzed. Then drink some more, and then become sloppy. (This happened more often than not when we’d go out with friends. Which deeply embarrasses me). Blacking out for even just 30-60mins of the end our our night was common for me.  

The one thing I’ve noticed is how much I relied on alcohol to socialize. I thought it made me just the funniest most chatty, non socially anxious gem out there(surprise! It definitely didn’t). 

Now I honestly don’t know how to branch out and make friends. Part of me wants to go back to trying AA just for the community aspect. 

I’m a stay at home mom, and holy smokes, do other moms constantly talk about drinking wine. All. The. Time. It’s honestly kinda isolating.

8am I made up a story to get rid of my mate out the house and made a promise to myself (and later my ex partner as I get drunk and give her needless grief) that this shit stops now.

I'll be 7 days in at 8am, its been fairly easy as there is clarity for me as to why I was drinking in the first place now and it's like a switch has flicked for me.

I completely realise there will be tests that lie ahead for me but this sub and sober blogs I'm reading have really made me realise I'm not alone with this and it's so inspiring to watch and read people freely opening up just to help others even a tiny % with each post.

I have successfully navigated sober October so far, and fully expect to complete it. My plan is to actually keep it going, probably until at least the end of the year.

The bad:
I didn’t expect not drinking this month to magically solve all my problems, or to definitely make me feel better mentally or physically. Removing the possibility of problems caused by drinking is enough for me. With that being said, this month has totally sucked. I’ve felt worse mentally the past couple weeks than I have in months. And It has nothing to do with not drinking. I’m not going through withdrawal, I don’t miss going to the bar(in fact I still go, I just drink Diet Coke or water), and I still have a social life (it’s the same as it was before, minus drinking, I wouldn’t say it’s ideal but it doesn’t suck either.)

What really sucks is when you’re trying to make positive changes in your life, but you actually feel worse despite actually following through with your intentions. It’s times like these when I seriously ponder whether life is worth it.",7

I've completely isolated myself,  between caring for kids/homeschooling/farm and not drinking,  while he's apparently been out partying it up while working out of town the past couple of years.  I'm hurt and I'm jealous and I hate the way that feels. I really just want to go buy a bottle of whiskey, take it home,  and just stop caring for tonight.  I miss the 'out' alcohol gave me from the yucky feelings.  It's so easy to get into the ""just for tonight"" or the ""I'm ready to moderate"" thinking. I'm fairly certain I won't be drinking tonight.

My apartment was trashed, my stove had been left on for the better part of 12 hours, and my cats food dish was as empty as the numerous beer and wine bottles around my place. 
If I keep doing this it's going to kill me. What once was my bandaid I used for my emotional problems was really a demon on my back all along. I hate it. It makes me hate myself.
So here I am on day 3 of sobriety. I feel sick and my head hurts. My body craves the feeling of my nightly ritual. I woke up today and the world wasn't spinning... I was just tired and remember everything I did last night. I feel a clarity I haven't felt in a long time. I don't want to go back, it scares me. Thanks for listening.

In my state you can buy any alcohol you want at a grocery store, but you can't use the self-checkout machines to pay for it. There are never enough cashiers for the volume of people filling their carts with booze (and incidental food), especially on a Friday night. So I'd be sitting there in line with my vodka waiting FOREVER to get checked out and go home. I thought I had no choice, though - I ""needed"" my alcohol.

But today, when I really did actually have to buy a few groceries after work, I was able to breeze right through that self-checkout line. No waiting. Can I tell you how good that felt? Because it felt amazing. 

It's a small thing, in the scope of a lifetime, to save 10 or 20 minutes. There are a lot of advantages to sobriety and I probably wouldn't even put shorter grocery store lines in my top 5.

A birthday celebration is always special but this year carries a deeper meaning in my heart.

Prior to last December, I was what you would call a high functioning alcohol abuser.  Never lost a job, got a DWI, always “kept up” with my responsibilities.  I thought I pretty much had it under control.

Until I didn’t.  In 2017 and 2018 I began to see some chinks in my alcohol armor.  Started blacking out more, couldn’t moderate, said some inappropriate things, was often slightly hungover.

Then at my daughters birthday party last year I had a raging hangover.  I went to secretly throw up while they were opening presents.  And then I had the sudden realization that as bad as that hangover was, I had one that was about as bad at her party the YEAR before that, too.  Holy shit!! I was going to be the drunk/hungover Mom for all eternity!

Well, I didn’t quit right then but I knew my drinking days were numbered.  It took me a bit to process and work up the courage, but about 4 weeks later, on December 1st 2018, I quit for good.  I haven’t looked back and damn, life is really really good.

Tomorrow I get to wake up, feeling fresh and rested, and give my family the love, care and attention that they deserve.  I get to celebrate my daughter with every drop of my soul.  I will be truly in the moment, and will remember the day with fondness and joy instead of pain and dread.

What a gift.  What a life.  Thank you, God. And thank you SD, you have been here with me every step of the way.  Sober on, my loves.  ❤️❤️",23

I understand people can suck, and I understand that life isn’t always fair, but being sober makes me realize a lot of the time I made things worse instead of better, drinking or not.

The past couple months have been really rocky for me, I've been in and out of doctor's offices it feels like almost every other day, all because of this crippling addiction.

I'm 31 years old but have been a very heavy alcoholic for at least 12 of those years. Like 10+ drinks, every day, no matter what. I could count on one hand the number of sober days during those years. I somehow managed to get a good education, keep a career and a roof over my head, and maintain good relationships with people.

That all came crashing down (literally) in August when I was so drunk I fell and fractured my spine in three places. Ended up in the hospital for three days, and worse having to admit I have a serious addiction to all of my close family and friends.

The thing is, it's very unusual for someone my age to fracture their spine and the doctor took note. After months of tests and visits I've been diagnosed with early onset osteoperosis, dangerously high blood pressure, esophageal scarring, and a whole host of other physical and mental issues. Before being discharged the doctor said if I kept going this way I'll be dead in a couple years.

Of course being an alcoholic, what's that to stop me? I maintained sobriety and went to AA for about a month, but then fell off again and haven't been able to maintain any consistency for more than a few days. I'm on day two right now, every hour every minute is a struggle. I think AA helps but isn't enough to keep me on track during this early stage of recovery.

I quit my job and my parents are coming to help me move back home for the holidays next week. They enrolled me in an excellent IOP program, and I'm so goddamn grateful they care so much. I'm really hoping this changes things for good and that I will physically recover as well so I don't, y'know, die. Anyways, that's my story. Hope it helps someone out there to read it.",215

I started telling myself every day that I would not do this for the rest of my life. Sure, I was struggling, but one day I would be successful.

I started to make a habit to tell myself this and truly believe it. It was kind of like this, ""One day I will do this. One day I will happily give up alcohol.""

I knew I could not sustain the cycle of abuse for another 35 or 36 years and I didn't want to. But when it was hard and the only thing I could do was not give up on myself, that is what I did.....even as I downed another bottle of wine. At nights when I woke up at 3 am anxious and hating myself, I would help myself fall back asleep by visualizing what that sober life in the future would look like. I'd see myself baking, hiking nature trails, bicycling, and being proud of myself. I'd visualize myself coming into work and speaking closely with my supervisor without the fear of smelling like alcohol.

So even if you are struggling and every single day is an unintended relapse, just don't give up on yourself. If you keep believing in yourself, one day you will be able to stop. Tell yourself that one day you can do it.

Well, I have some minor reasons to be angry, or better to say a little unsatisfied, by this angry, no way. It is just my brain playing with me demanding the drink.

My life is unrecognizable from what it was 4 years ago.  It was organized around fear, and alcohol gave me a brief reprieve for a few hours each night. I spent most of my time alone and didn't maintain friendships. Also I was very in the closet and just kind of said nah to my sexuality. 

I tried quitting several times over the years. Sometimes I could go a few weeks, but I somehow ended up back where I was, no matter how motivated. I probably have 10 throwaway accounts. 

Truly, the last time I quit I was far less motivated and excited about it than the several previous attempts. I was resigned to my fate as an alcoholic but decided go give recovery an honest chance before fully giving up. 

Today I live with my boyfriend of 2 years and have a job that I love. Coming out wasn't comfortable but wasn't necessarily scary.  I knew it would be okay in the end. That's probably the biggest change: I still get stressed more than anyone I know, but instead of that dark fear that this will be my undoing,  there's this underlying comfort that life is going to be what it is and I can just roll with it.",16

The difference is discipline weighs ounces while regret weighs tons""

As I embark on not drinking, I like to remind myself of this quote.  I quit drinking before, and I can do it again.  Day 1.  All it takes is one day.   Everyone who quit drinking started with 1 day.  I don't want to wake up ever again with the ""oh no, not again"" feeling.  I want to be in control of my life.  I want to be confident that no matter what life throws at me,  I can handle it, and I won't drink or act out as a way to deal with my emotions.

I want to stop caring what other people think too.  Part of the reasons I slipped back so much in the past is because of ""what will happen when xyz comes over and wants to have a beer"".  How will your friends and relatives view this?  What will you tell them if they ask why you quit?  My in laws come from a culture where everyone drinks, and to not drink can be tantamount to an insult.   If I learned anything in my short 32 years on this planet, it's to stop caring what other people think of me.  

I have to wake up with myself in the morning, not them.  Yes, it's true, perhaps I will miss out on some bonding moments over drinking with people.  However, I have to do what's right for me.  I have lots of good memories in the past of not drinking.  In fact, some of the best memories I have are times in my life when I didn't drink.  If people view me differently, talk behind my back, feel disappointed that I won't drink with them, well so be it.  

I also need to let go of this notion that ""well, you've said you will quit drinking hundreds of times, and it's never stuck so you might as well drink again"".  What kind of logic is this?  I either have a goal, or not.  On day 3, 4 or 5 when this voice pops in my head I am going to remind myself of the time I quit for 1 year plus.  It took hundreds, and I mean hundreds of times before that 1 year stuck.  

I need to stick this landing this time, and stop with the excuses.  The pain of discipline is difficult, but the pain of regret (that I sit with right now) is unbearable.",19

Completely embarrassed him in front of his friends (wonderful, considerate people) to the point that they reached out asking if he needed any support after they left. I’m disgusted and ashamed with myself. I’ve had too much to drink and fucked up WAY too many times. My saint of a boyfriend has had infinite patience, anger, and support for my problem before... but this time I think I broke him. 

I’ve been trying to moderate, or cut down on my amount of drinking. Clearly it didn’t work. I went 4 months without an “incident”, but I’ve learned that even if I can have one drink, sometime next week or next month I WILL drink to excess and screw up again. This time was bad. 

Guys, he’s a shell of a person. I immediately knew how bad I fucked up and went straight to an AA meeting - determined to quit cold turkey for good. But since I’ve been sober for 5 days he’s been drunk for all 5 days. He says he doesn’t care anymore. He gives me one word answers. I told him I haven’t been drinking and he said “I don’t care. Don’t tell me. You have nothing to prove to me”. He keeps offering me shots and glasses of wine. When I ask if it’s over he says no,  but he doesn’t care. 

Thing is, I can’t even push for more because I don’t deserve it. I’ve hurt him with my drinking in more ways than I care to get into with this post. I feel so, SO dreadfully bad and I’m afraid I’ve screwed it up for good. 

And living with him while he hates me just makes me want to drink even more. But I know it’s up to me to stay sober and prove to him I can change... I’m just so worried about him now. He won’t let me in and he seems to be spiralling and it’s all my fault. 

I know I just have to wait and see how it progresses, but I can’t help asking myself if this is even fixable.

When we went out to dinner with friends I was the live wire, joking and keeping the energy levels high. I would cook lavish meals at home and wake up to a recycling container full of empty bottles, the measure of an excellent night.

We would eat great food, drink fantastic wine, catch up with friends, have a great time and all was well in the world. 

I am 56 days sober and Went out last night with some old and dear friends. I was tired, my energy level was low as I have not been sleeping well and I felt really rotten. Food was bland and I struggled to maintain interest in the conversation. It was not a good night. Is this the way its going to be? Does the sober me actually prefer too stay home with the family for a quiet meal and then some tea? 

Was the reason I loved going out for meals and entertaining at home purely because it allowed me an excuse to get hammered? An obsession with food, restaurants and cooking has kind of defined me over the years and now I can’t get really excited about any of the new places opening up in my hometown or spending 2-3 hours cooking a meal. What now? Is this just a passing phase or has this new sober life surfaced a completely new person in me, one that I frankly don’t know at all? What is more scary is that others don’t know that person either?

I know I have a lot more work to do, as I unpack the person I have been for 30+ years. Just helps sharing with others that I know are going through the same thing.",2

This is my first time posting on reddit in general so I apologize in advance for any errors in formatting or spelling. 

My birthday was last weekend Saturday. There was a Halloween party at my job and I was excited to go and have fun on my day. I was there for one hour and the last thing I can remember is dancing with some friends and then suddenly I was waking up in bed Sunday morning. There was vomit in my hair and on my floor. My mom told me some coworkers brought me home, where she had to change me out of my clothes and then practically carry me to bed (I’m 5’2, she’s 5’8 so I believe it). 

Thankfully, she decided to check up on me five minutes later, and found me on my back choking on my own vomit so she changed my clothes again, changed my sheets, and put me back to bed. I didn’t have my purse or my cellphone and I only had a few hours before I would be heading out to stay with a friend of my mom’s who lives near the facility where I do my community service...oh yeah, did I tell you I got a DUI last year? 

Anyways, I was able to get my purse but not my cell phone which definitely complicated things since I use lyft to get around. This has been building for some time now and I knew that eventually shit would hit the fan. Now it’s time face my demons, deal with the consequences of my actions, and clean up this mess I’ve made of my life.

I went to a pub with my SO - usually we would get beers in straight away but we both had NA beers.

Then we went clubbing, usually I’d be wasted but I stayed sober the entire night and just danced away.

It was one of the best nights out I’ve had in ages.

I’m writing this to give hope to anyone who feels like they might lose something by giving up alcohol. I did everything I would usually do, the only difference is my attitude. And today I’ve gained a lovely hangover free day that I can spend however I like without be bed ridden!

I sent an email to the director of the program that allows us to use the space (a program that deals with opioid  addiction) and inquired. Got an email that was a little snippy. The wine was for their Gala/auction. They forgot to move it.

Here's where I need your wisdom:

I don't appreciate the organization fundraising using the source of my addiction. I find it wildly tone-deaf. It feels like less than an honest mistake.

Having a bottle of wine in a room where addicts in any stage of recovery could have been alone and had the addict-brain thought ""Who would know if I took this?""

&#x200B;

Things have been going amazingly in my life in the time since I have stopped drinking, with a lot of milestones I could never have achieved (I lost a ton of weight and even climbed a mountain!) if I were to still attached to the hip with my pints of beer. But there's still the grander social world to contend with, and that is where I find myself scared and retreating.

&#x200B;

Halloween is coming up, and I have a costume lined up to match my girlfriend (Roger and Jessica Rabbit for the curious), and I should be excited about this party at this club that we are going to, but I am just bricking it right now. I am so afraid of being in a situation where everyone is going to be drinking and ""getting on it"". I don't want to be a party pooper, and I don't want to have a terrible time either.

&#x200B;

I guess what I am reaching out to everyone for is some advice, some tips, some stories from all of you who have been in a similar situation. How do I weather the storm of late-night Halloween parties as a sobernaut? I enjoy the celebration of fear that is Halloween, but this is not the kind of fear that I had in mind.",5

Today was a great day. Woke up early enough to surprise my sister and friend with coffee at work to celebrate the morning of day 7, work was great and I was on top of my game and that was then followed by a night carving pumpkins with my sister and good friends. Despite the fact that they were drinking and smoking, I still had a great time drinking sparkling water. 

Last week, my husband asked me to leave and to please give him some space and stay away from the house when he is there while we both try to figure our shit out. It is killing me, but I am trying to use the pain as a reason to get better instead of a reason to drink. He went out of town somewhere for a few days (no idea where, as he doesn’t want to talk to me), so I decided to spend a night back at home in a real bed and see my dog. I’ve been missing her like crazy, but made the decision to leave her at the house since I didn’t know where I would be staying yet and I wanted her to have the stability of being in her home. 

Now, I live with my husband and 2 male roommates. We also have some friends in from out of town that are staying here. So I was expecting to walk into a mess, at least, since I am the ‘cleaner/mother hen’ of the group. However, that was not the case. It was indeed messy and gross, but most of my plants are half dead from not getting sun or watered, my beta fish was dead and looked like he had been for a bit, and my dog has lost a noticeable amount of weight and is all sunken in and bony. No one was home when I got there, which I was glad for because I was fuming.

I am so mad and upset. I am doing my fucking hardest to better myself and show him I am not worth giving up on just yet. I am respecting his request for space and staying away from our home of 4 years, living out of my truck and couch surfing. But he and/or my roommates can’t take care of a few of my things and let it go to shit in only a matter of days?
What in the actual fuck. 

It’s not worth me losing my 7 days of sobriety over, so I’m not worried about drinking over it like I usually would. I’m more just pissed than anything else, and needed to vent. 

I hope everyone else celebrating a week today had a good day as well, and hopefully a better night than myself.",5

When I first got sober I sporadically went to some AA meetings and got a 24 hour coin, then the various months and eventually a year.  Even though I ultimately decided the 12 step program wasn't my style, on my second anniversary I still went back to get a 2-year coin.  I'm coming up on my 3rd anniversary next week and I want a new reward, something tangible to keep in my wallet to remind me how far I've come.   I don't feel comfortable going back to a meeting to get a coin though,  it's a combination of not wanting to brand myself with something I don't identify with (like I wouldn't wear a Christian cross or a Pittsburgh Steelers shirt or a Hufflepuff patch, AA just isn't my ""team,"") and not wanting to appropriate their imagery and culture as it were.  Like, that's not for me,  I don't have a right to waltz in and claim the trophy when I haven't put any time or energy into being a part of the group. 



I currently keep my 2 year and 24 hour coins in the change pocket of my wallet purse.   I'll likely continue to keep the 24 hour coin because when I was newly sober AA was there for me when I needed somewhere to go.  But I need something else to represent where I'm at in life going in to my 3rd year of sobriety.   

I'm not asking for ideas exactly,  just examples of anything you all might use as your daily,  portable reminders of recovery?",1

From when I stopped drinking on Sept. 7th until yesterday I felt I was in a kind of ""manic"" state. It was good as far as work and social life goes. I was repairing a lot of damage to friends and family and I was putting in full, honest work days for the first time in a long time and feeling good about it in the evenings. But it never felt sustainable.

I felt like I was running an endurance race. And maybe I could have made it another month. Maybe a year. But every moment I'm really sober I'm aware of just how unfulfilling life is and how even if I attempted to fill that void with hobbies and relationships, my passion for both would eventually die. And in that way everything feels kind of fake and temporary and meaningless and strange.

Going out on dates, spending time at the beach. So happy. I want to be happy for them.

&#x200B;

I've been reading a lot of posts lately about feelings, mostly about dealing with the tough stuff, because even 3.5 years on, even after incorporating and sticking to a consistent yoga routine (not too much, I try not to force myself to do it if I'm not feeling it so I don't start hating it, aim for 15/20 minutes maybe 5-6 times a week), it's still something I really struggle with. 

&#x200B;

I think life circumstances have a lot to do with it - single parenting, not STRUGGLING financially but definitely a precarious balance with finances, especially living in a rich area where there's definitely some competition amongst the school moms/kids, just overall judgement in general! In the process of planning my kid's birthday party and it's the one time of year that I kinda splurge on/spoil my kid, but had a conversation with a neighbor who grew up during the aftermath of WW2 and she was just so judgey about me splurging a bit on her party. And a big part of me worries about her feeling ""less than"" among her friends as she turns 9 as is more aware of what people have and what she doesn't; single parent household and also financially - she's not materialistic, she's super appreciative and kind, but I think it's natural to compare yourself to others and want to fit in especially during older kid/teen years. So these two conflicting judgements are so hard to balance!!! Perhaps a part of me feels like I should make more effort to fit in with the school moms, but I am def more of an introvert so trying to balance that with being social for my kid's sake. I don't know, I knew that quitting drinking wouldn't solve all my problems, and it's definitely alleviated a lot of the heaviness of my anxiety, but it does hit me hard sometimes.

&#x200B;

On a more positive note, I was pretty much guilt tripped by a work colleague to join her in a salsa lesson, so I went to the first one last week and another last night. Since I'm on my own with my kid and don't often get free time, I've always been protective of that precious free time (one day every month or two) and take the time to do NOTHING - no cooking, no cleaning, just binge watch tv and eat whatever I don't have to cook. The last time I had a day off I decided to give some gardening a shot, so I bought a few basics and cleared out a lot of overgrown stuff in my yard, planted a few little seeds, etc. I guess just trying to use that precious free time to something that's also good for my mental health. So seeing a few seeds start to grow, then signing up for these salsa lessons and going out in the evening and trying something new, feeling a little silly/stupid/bad at it, but being in a room full of people doing the same, was really fulfilling. Kind of counter-intuitive but by spending the time that I usually spend resting on other activities which require more time and energy, it seems to be filling a hole in my life somehow.

&#x200B;

Anyway I guess I just wanted to sum up (mostly for myself, as I go back and read my old posts sometimes) where I'm at in my journey, 3.5 years in. Overall, EVERYTHING in my life is more positive. Despite still struggling with bad days, I'm more able to sit with my feelings than I used to be, though that's still something I'm working on. Haven't gotten myself into therapy although that's been on my list for awhile - that motivation will come, slowly, I hope. But recently, on the worst of bad days, it crossed my mind that technically I could drink (I had the free day coming up on the wknd). I mean, we all COULD, couldn't we? It's incredible that every day, we all choose not to. Playing the tape forward was always the strongest tool in my toolbox and even doing that for the briefest of seconds was enough to snap me out of it. 

&#x200B;

My relationship with my kid is UNBELIEVABLE these days (even though she can be kind of a jerk at bedtime haha). I just imagine all the trust that she places in me, disappearing day after day as she sees me passed out on the couch after her bedtime (since she often can't fall asleep and comes out to chat, we are working on it :p). Her dad is unreliable and I just picture her losing faith in the grownups around her, feeling like she is a burden when I'm hungover/cranky in the mornings or she's unable to wake me if she has a bad dream, if she needs to unburden herself after a fight with a friend and I'm glassy eyed, ignoring her, too focused on my wine and tv to make her feel like I'm interested in her school friend drama. I grew up with an alcoholic dad and a wonderful mom, and despite my mom I struggle so much with trusting people/attachment issues. I quit drinking hoping to avoid that same fate for my daughter and she seems so well adjusted, confident, independent, just a happy kid. I'm going to keep going for my kid, even on the hard days, especially on the hard days. And I'm so grateful to have this community to vent to, to strengthen my resolve when I'm feeling weak, to remind me of the reasons I quit when it's hard to remember. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this far this was way longer than I expected but kinda hit the spot for me <3",17

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!**

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. 
It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up and then try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I am efficient, healthy, balanced and my kids even joke that I “reverse age” when I’m sober and who even knew the fountain of youth is just not drinking rather than a $90 creme? I seriously kick ass sober and feel wonderful as a human and mother and friend and even when I can have seriously depressed days I am still kinda happy in a weird way. 

So yesterday was the first great day after a string of shitty ones, get my monthly former-drinker Vitamin B injection, which gives me a glow up and pep in my step ... and I step right into the wine shop? Like wtf. It’s like I’m an actress just playing the role of responsible drinker, selecting a fine wine that I will casually enjoy and go to bed early and do nothing stupid.  I will act in the role of “Wine Drinker” tonight and go back to sobriety tomorrow, ok 👍 

I have promises made to friends and family to never drink again who are heartbroken when I do, I have a sponsor-like friend in place to call immediately if I start thinking about drinking, I take medication that I cannot take while drinking that keeps my mood level, head clear and sleeping 8-9 solid hours a night, l am famous for making my self and home go from Pinterest fabulous to absolute dumpster fire in less than 48 hours of consuming a bottle of wine, and I know full well I will do something stupid, piss people off, not sleep, be filled with anxiety and panic the entire next day and spend a good day or two getting my self and home back to running efficiently. BECAUSE I HATE WHAT DRINKING DOES TO MY LIFE AND I LOVE BEING SOBER. 

That’s just facts. I don’t miss drinking when I’m sober. This Naked Mind speaks to me deeply. I actually do shit that’s good for my brain and like how I look and feel and how my house looks and feels and how my life looks and feels. I like sleeping early. I am positive about my future and life even though it’s kind of shit right now. 

The three people I love most in this world are so disgustingly happy when I’m healthy and balanced and sober and making them happy makes me the happiest. I am repulsed at the thought of alcohol and who I become on it. 

So WTF. Why do I turn into an actress and casually stroll into the wine shop? Not a single thing last night was better because I drank. I was not cooler or funnier or smarter or prettier or more clever. And everyone knew immediately. My daughters knew immediately. People from the internet knew immediately because I am famous for testing and breaking rules and treating certain platforms like my own personal stage when I’m drunk. My best friend knew immediately something was off and he gets MAD scary and also very sad when I drink. 

Those three most important people in my life deserve better than to have confidence in me and my sobriety to fall off the wagon on a whim, and so casually. They have seen some scary shit of me off the wagon: serious depression, weeks spent chasing hangovers and anxiety with more alcohol, suicidal ideation, hospitalizations, Psych issues, pill addiction, lies, and I have done and spoken horrendous things to friends I love dearly. 

I need to print this or something, at least come back to this next time I decide to play Wine Drinker. I seriously cannot stand that woman and I don’t even know why I let her be, yk? Wine Drinker doesn’t give a fuck, doesn’t call the friend, doesn’t cook dinner and orders pizza. Wine Drinker is a selfish bitch. 

I hate to be the Day 1 AGAIN person because I don’t even really like counting sober days and I’ve had about 100 Day 1 AGAINs, but fuck it, Day 1 AGAIN for the last time. IWNDWYT sober soldiers 👊",91

Then she felt bad and got a heart surgery and stopped drinking for a while. She got the cow valve thing so she could drink. 

""Just a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, you know? I won't drink too much. Don't worry kiddo."" She had said. Now she's drinking again. It's not as much but now she's depressed and suicidal after so long because of bills and everything. I want to help. 

She's easily agitated, has a secret bottle she drinks from, she's suicidal and depressed, and she thinks she's nothing but a failure and drinking is only cementing these thoughts. I want it to stop. I want her to be happy again. I missed a high school field trip today because I forgot my permission slip and now my mom is upset at herself. ""I'm on their list now."" She said to herself and I heard it so I asked what list. She told me that parents who don't take care of their children get phone calls and letters and eventually arrested. She got upset at me when I asked if she got any letters or calls before; if it happened; what the list meant; why she feared it and she didn't say anything. She told me to leave the room and get out so I did. I'm writing this now. I'm afraid. I'm seventeen and I'm afraid for her because I'm understanding. 

Bills are tight but my dad has a job again. We were going to buy some new phonecards but she was too drunk to accompany my father to get some money from the bank account (we've been using my savings since it's been hard to pay things and she's the only other person who can take out money). 

I just want to help her. I don't want to lose my mom. She's means everything to me. Please help. I'm trying to be there for her but I don't know what to do anymore. I've listened to her, I've been there for her, I've done everything I can think of. I've been supportive but she ignores or forgets it all the next day. She only sees the negatives. My dads worried as well.

Update: She's rarely drinking now! I think. Either that or she hides it well. Nevertheless, it's something I think and her alcohol stash is minimal. It's small too and she doesn't drink too much. Yay.",9

I stopped drinking in May because I just got tired of being hungover and the negative effect alcohol was having on my emotional well being. Abstaining from alcohol for me is LUCKILY not very hard to do. I'm able to hang out at bars for a bit before I just get bored but I never have an urge or itch to drink like I used to.

The summer was great, I felt peppy, bright, and like things were trending upwards. Then about Mid-September I started to feel this void that alcohol had left behind. I no longer really wanted to hang out with my friends while they were drunk because it was kind of annoying to be having a coherent conversation one minute and the next minute you can tell they aren't with it. My therapist thought it might be a good idea for me to go to AA to try and meet other sober ppl and develop a sober support network of sorts. It took many weeks of hemming and hawing before I finally went and I would say my experience was mixed. A little good, a little not so good. It was refreshing to hear other people talk about their struggles with alcohol and be honest about their drinking. But it was also pretty intense. I would maybe not consider myself an alcoholic but rather a person who has a problem with alcohol. When I left I felt both glad that I went but confused about if I wanted to go back.

Long story short, I'm not sure if AA is for me and I'm not sure if I want to go through the steps and everything. I think I'll try a couple of other meetings but I guess I'm trying to find something that's more about connecting with people who are living sober lives and looking to grow their sober network? Are there other things besides AA like this?",1

I just didn't know what else to do at that moment, it was some kind of acute mental crisis and I needed acute help of whatever kind. So I made the desperate, but conscious decision to open a bottle of my husband's beer, I knelt down on the kitchen floor, had a swig and it tasted pretty vile. I did feel more relaxed pretty much straight away (some kind of placebo effect or release of mental tension I suppose), but I didn't have another swig. One was enough and yeah, it did pretty much taste like sh*t. I have been drinking non-alcoholic beers and they are so much more palatable. I put the bottle on the counter and poured it down the sink half an hour later. So that's my day and the story of my mini-relapse. I'm not resetting my counter as I've been sober since February and I'm not going to let one swig of nasty tasting beer mess that up.

Seven months. Holy fuck. I remember when I couldn't go seven minutes without a drink. 7 hours without a drink and i'd be a sweaty shaking mess in my bed. 7 days without a drink would be a fucking MIRACLE. But here I stand with 7 months.

Life is so fucking crazy different. I recently was at a party where some of my friends were passing around a bottle of my old favorite brand of cheap vodka. I took the bottle and took a deeeeeeep smell of it.

Holy FUCK. I used to chug that fucking poison for breakfast. That shit smelled like literal death. It blows my mind that i'd every day for YEARS I would wake up, grab a big cup from the cabinet, mix Gatorade and monster in it and pour a pint in and CHUG IT. 

EVERY FUCKING DAY.  After that i'd take 2 more pints and mix them in with a big bottle of gaterade and sip on them over the next few hours. Around 4-5 i'd chug another pint to get me back to where i wanted to be. Mix another 2 pints and sip over hours. Then at the end of the day i'd ""really start drinking"" and just chug straight vodka out of the bottle until i was fucked up enough to finally sleep. I drank about a gallon of Russian Ball Sweat vodka a day. 

that was my entire existence. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I'm no longer that sad defeated piece of shit. I am in control of my destiny. I am in control of my vices. 

&#x200B;

I wish all of you just starting the best of luck. And remember that at the end of the day its YOU and YOU alone that decides if you stay sober. It doesn't matter how good or bad of a day you've had. If you won the lottery or if you dog was hit by a car. If you wife left you or your job is hard, none of that shit makes you take a drink. 

You make the choice.

One minor hitch: I’ve got a social work thing coming up and it’s going to be pretty boozy. My colleagues are not aware of my history of alcohol abuse.

I’m wondering how to handle this situation. I wouldn’t feel comfortable with saying that my sobriety is due to issues with alcohol abuse, as this would damage my reputation/credibility and I can’t really afford this being in a management position. 

I’m sure plenty have been in this situation before so would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Im motivated to stop drinking, but am looking for a little perspective around my specific circumstance. Im the kinda guy who can go all week without drinking, alcohol has never (luckily) interfered with my life in a major way, and there are even occasions where I can have a couple of drinks and call things good. 

However.. that said. When i do drink, i have a very hard time controlling the amount i drink, on a regular basis. So even though i might refrain mon-fri, saturday night comes and my intention is to have a  couple drinks turns into 5 or 6. I feel like shit every time and im tired of it. Every bad choice ive made all revolves around alcohol. It doesnt get me closer to my fitness goals, and I have regret every single time. There's plenty of people who can have just a drink, and MOST of the time, im not one of those people. I can be, from time to time. The other night I had 2 or 3 and called it good. But i have that pull inside me once i start drinking it feels like its never enough. Combine this with the fact that i have a couple of relationships in my life with people, my dad one of them, who have both dealt with bad addition issues. I watched my dad put back two handles of scotch over a weekend. 

Ive fought with myself. Ive reasoned with myself. Ive set up every rule you can imagine.  Ive used every app you can think of and tactic. Im tired of it.

Anybody else here that type of drinker? I know theres all types. Im just looking for some encouragement that stopping for good wont detract from my social life etc etc.

Thanks.",7
2019-10-24 11:36:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dmi4hn/looking_at_aa_from_all_sides/,Looking at AA from all sides.,"hi all,

so i've not had a drink since March 25, 2017, and a large part of that is due to attending AA meetings regularly. and i am truly grateful for the program, don't get me wrong. i have made lifelong friends and have learned a lot about myself and sobriety in the program. 

however.

this year has been rough. i celebrated 2 years sober in March, and had my life ripped to pieces in May--which was in large part due to myself and all of the work i had been ignoring in AA (character defects--they'll get ya). since May, i've had to move home with my parents and start new meetings, which were actually the same groups i had gotten sober in before (confused? i got sober in my parents' house in 2017, returned to my ex that same year. 2019 ex and i split, i moved home with parents) 

and honestly, guys, i am just not feeling it anymore. i can't admit this to anyone in AA in person, as the group i'm attending is VERY into spiritual fitness and accepting help from a Higher Power and fellowship and would probably just tell me to get more numbers, speak to more alcoholics, etc. 

i guess what i'm looking for here is some perspective. i know i'm an alcoholic. once i start drinking i do not stop. i was fortunate enough to avoid any physical ramifications from my use, but i definitely got a DUI and am still dealing with the consequences from that. i attend therapy weekly, and i tend to avoid situations where there is drinking, but i have no problems being around it. my thing is, every time i skip a meeting (i aim for 3/week, in reality its more like 1-2) i feel awful. not because i want to drink, but because i've been told so many times that skipping meetings==going out and drinking, eventually.

so, stopdrinking, what does not drinking look like without AA? does anyone have experience like this? i'm just kinda floundering, figuring it out. any advice is welcome.",7

Yesterday was my day 1 after thinking about this seriously for probably a year and a half or so. It went pretty well, although I was traveling which is frequently when I drink more than usual. I get home around 11PM and that's when the voice pipes up, ""You know, if you want some wine, you have to buy it before midnight. Only an hour to go!"" I ignore it and unpack my suitcase. Again, the voice chimes in ""You won't be able to get any until tomorrow if you don't go now! Only 45 minutes till the clock strikes 12!"" I cuddle my dog and set up my office for work from home tomorrow. Then that voice trumpets at me, ""YOU WILL MISS THE DEADLINE AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO CHANGE YOUR MIND IF YOU DON'T GO NOW! BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY, YOU CAN JUST BUY IT AND HAVE THE OPTION AND THERE'S ONLY 28 MINUTES NOW!!""

So I refilled my water bottle, set up my phones to charge, made sure the cat was fed and watered and went to bed. I just hate that I get so antsy around the idea of not having the option. That stupid artificial scarcity just makes me feel like I'm missing out, you know? It's like those infomercials that blare at you that ""this incredible offer is only available right this instant!"" As a kid, I was amazed and wondered how anyone could miss out on these offers. Then you get older and realize they run those infomercials practically 24/7 for months so the offer is pretty much always valid.

It's been a wild and emotional year. I have up drinking almost 300 days ago and was able to spend time with my grandparents in the springtime for a week, sober. We talked and even laughed a bit. It's something I'll treasure. Going back to when we were kids, my brother and I would spend our summers in Poland with our grandparents. We'd go haggle at the markets, spend time on the farm I wish we still had, and I'd hear from grandma that wearing a hat all summer will make me go bald (full set of hair still)  

All this is flooding back right now. I'm trying to stay distracted and for the most part I'm feeling composed. This isn't about me though or my battles with alcohol. I just spoke with my father on the phone and I've never heard him so morose or broken up.

I quit drinking and smoking pot because I reached a point where I was no longer the person I used to be - I lost my entire circle of friends, personality, was bitter towards everyone, and was isolated, lonely and angry. I was desperate to have my old life back, so I thought that getting sober and being involved in AA would be the best way to reinvent myself (and hopefully make friends).

I am in the best shape of my life, am starting to make friends, am taking classes to better my career, and overall it feels great to have more responsibilities and structure in my life which makes my life feel bigger.

However, I’ve been having a lot of doubts on whether I truly am an alcoholic, or just had a drinking problem and needed to take an extended break from alcohol and pot so I can reassess my relationship with them and see the life that I can have when I am not so focused on getting out of myself all the time.

I’ve gone to more meetings than I can count, and I can see that my bottom was never as low as most of the people in the rooms, so it makes me wonder if I can ever go back to drinking and smoking socially. A lot of times I feel like I am missing out on the fun and I often fantasize about experiencing alcohol and pot with friends (I would only want to do it once in a while and not all the time). These thoughts have been happening a lot, whenever more and more positive things happen in my life.

Later, I was buying ingredients to make a casserole after work and one ingredient was 100ml wine. I know I see this as an excuse to drink the rest of the bottle, because it’s an essential ingredient, right? And then I can’t let the wine spoil. I wrestled with it then decided to get a half-bottle.

I decided to do Sober October this year just to see how it went and if I could exercise self-control, as I've failed Dry January both times I tried. It's going...really well. We're most of the way through the month and I've been able to be around alcohol in bars, pubs, etc. and been happy to just drink coke or some other soft drink. People have offered me wine etc. at parties and I've just been able to turn it down easily.

I've always seen myself as stopping drinking one day, I just wasn't sure when. I don't know whether to try and keep it up after this month is over. Being sober whilst other people are drunk makes you realise how annoying drunk people are and what a horrible drug alcohol really is. I feel like for the most part I'd be able to keep it up. I'm not that tempted to drink when going out or seeing people anymore. I just think of things like Christmas and I'd feel like I was missing out by not drinking, or that I'd feel pressured to drink.

I think I'm going to try and keep up the non-drinking because I do feel the benefit. I love not waking up hungover, not losing loads of money in the pub, not embarrassing myself or blacking out and not knowing what I said or did.

Going from drinking a lot every day and night to giving up completely in a day. Apparently, the push I needed was getting food poisoning and throwing up for a couple days to detox.

It hasn’t been particularly hard to give up alcohol, but it was much harder to realize that it was a way to escape from myself and actual problems in life. Six months in, and I was pushed over my limits and had to seek professional help, and am I glad that I did. Not only did I start analyzing my life and the struggles I was running from (career, marriage, life goals), but I also ended up being diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD which have probably led me to the state I was in.

I guess I just needed to share my story. I have learnt a lot along the way and am using the experience to share with others and help people around me - a very rewarding feeling! If you are struggling, it is okay to seek help and you should definitely give it a go!

But when I travel I am thrilled (initially) to have the opportunity to get sloshed by myself in my hotel room. My travel plans all revolve around staying the extra day so that I can get hammered. 
Why?  I dont know. I guess I don't really want to quit for myself. I just want to quit for my kids. I am really conflicted with another trip coming up. Thanks for your thoughts. Does anyone else feel this way ?",6

They have me on a Librium taper and so far it’s rid me of basically all symptoms. It helped me get a great night of sleep last night. Insomnia has been a big trigger for me in the past and after previous detoxes (without benzos, done at home) it typically takes me 4 nights of no sleep in order for Trazodone to begin helping me. I need to return to work soon where I will be required to produce a lot of creative work and I am absolutely unable to do that on no sleep. I am currently terrified about that my insomnia will return full force once my librium taper ends. I’m wondering, have others experienced insomnia returning with a vengeance after ending Librium?",8

>[If a person does not accustom and train himself to appreciate what others do for him, then he will also fail to recognize and feel grateful for all that God does for him. And when one cannot appreciate everything that God does for him, he is unlikely to ever feel happy and content.](http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/parasha.aspx?id=234)

This is an interesting quote for me, as an atheist, to find and keep in my files. I’ve had it for quite a while, and read over it every few weeks as I look for a seed for the TT posts. This week it finally feels relevant. I spent this past weekend camping--as close as I come to appreciating everything that god does for me. Nature is soul-filling, and leaves me happy and content. Happy and content, I can better appreciate what others do for me.

My return immediately plunged me into a thorny and unpleasant work issue. Colleagues have been responsive when needed and accommodating when necessary. I greatly appreciate that, as it allows me to focus on the tasks at hand and let other things wait. With their help, I’m reducing my overall stress, which allows me to appreciate the transition to winter and newly fallen snow.

How about you? What are you appreciating today?",9

I got to the point where I'd say ""What's the point of just one?"" finally realizing the deep implications of that internal reaction.

Anyway, I've spent quality time with my kids and husband eaxh night, present and focused. Dinner made and kitchen clean. Things prepared for the next day. Great mornings getting out the door with no rush. Work has been the usual but I am fully functional and able all day. I find myself less stressed, less rushed. I have enjoyed reading each night before bed, remembering everything I had taken in the night before (I really enjoy reading but haven't been in the right frame of mind). And I had the best poop I've had in years this afternoon. I mean wow.

Feeling great. I know it's early, but no urge to pull in to the liquor store, basically on autopilot; an urge I have read on this sub many times. I keep thinking how great this feeling is and I want to do my best to keep it going.

I know failure is a part of success, and I'll struggle, but I will stay focused and just keep thinking how awesome this is. I want to work towards addressing other issues I've bandaged with alcohol for so long and get to know myself again. I want to do this for myself, because ultimately that is for the betterment of my family and all relationships as well.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up and then try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have had a trying day today friends. I can't even BOLD anything or put anything in *italics*. Well one word anyway. Woke up to another Shrew in the bedroom screaming at my cat. Jesus, can those little things make noise! Leroy had his big, furry foot on the Shrew's tail while the Shrew looked right at him & shrieked all to be damned. Both the Shrew & the cat know the cat will not eat him. Only can bounce it around til it dies. Shrew's give off a very bad taste to its enemies, so they are rarely eaten. I wish I didn't have this information in my head, but there it is.There have been 2500 ants in the bathtub for 2 weeks. Every day I spray them with Clorox and they wash down the drain in the shower. Every night their families come looking for their departed relatives & they also get a Clorox shower. And so on... Today Otis escaped outside right at dusk, prime Coyote killing time. So I'm out there in the backyard with the bottle of Clorox to protect my cat from a den of Coyotes. Yes, we own stock in who owns Clorox. But this cat is my heart & my soul & I don't want him hurt or dead. At least not before me. 45 minutes later he jumped over the green space gate & eyes me on the deck with the Clorox bottle. His eyes said it all, ""Hey Mom I'm home! So the ants are back?"" Little bastard!

After this Saturday I just didn’t want to drink, which always happens, but for once I actually tried. Mainly since I discovered this page and realized I can actually stop if I seriously try.

Now tonight I have a little more than 60 hours with no alcohol, but seriously want to drink with baseball tonight. I’ve drank while watching sports, playing games, working on my cars, and even cooking daily and it’s hard to pull the two apart.

While I haven’t been this far away from alcohol since I started drinking, it does feel great but I do feel scared and really want to drink while watching the Astros tonight!

Today should've been day five but it's day one.,"Hi everyone. I've never really had anyone to talk to about quitting drinking. It has gotten way out of control.

I was tapering and was down to six 7.5% beers Thursday and five on Friday. I had nothing at all starting Saturday. I made it through the shakes, anxiety, vomiting, and sweating until my pillow and sheets were completely soaked. I was actually feeling great physically and then yesterday evening I went out and had a 22oz beer at a bar.

I don't know why I did it. I wasn't craving it that badly. I just got the idea in my head that I could go have one and it would be fine. I got the seed of an idea in my head and tried to push it away and it just kept coming back. The whole time I was driving there I was telling myself it was a mistake and that I should go home, but I didn't. My tolerance is so high I don't even think I got a buzz. I want to delude myself into thinking I can have an occasional drink but I can't. I can't even bring myself to tell my SO that I drank yesterday.

By that time, I was highly overstimulated by excessive socializing and completely sick of club soda and lime, so even tho it was super spendy ($8), and not on the list of open bar items, I gave it a shot.

Maybe it's all in my head, but it was like instant zen. I have never tried any CBD products before, so I had zero expectations on results. It was like everything I ever wanted from weed, but never received. No buzz, just calm.

The other day, my wife went out of town for a conference. Back when I was drinking, I would've used that as a prime opportunity to get absolutely shitfaced while playing video games for hours on end for the entire time she was out of town. This time while she was gone, I headed out to one of my old drinking haunts to get a delicious greasy cheeseburger (we've been mostly vegan for the last year or so) that I consider to be one of the best in town. The restaurant was crowded, but I found a seat at the very end of the bar against the wall. I ordered the cheeseburger (with bacon) and a glass of soda water with a lemon. I brought a book to read while I waited for my meaty treat. Once it came, I absolutely CRUSHED this cheeseburger like it was the last one on the face of the Earth. It was bliss. As I was taking my last bites, I looked up and realized that from my position at the bar, my face was probably no more than 2 feet from the liquor shelves. Bottles and bottles of high end tequila and Irish whiskey were staring me right in the face. Here's the crazy part: I had been sitting there for at least 45 minutes and **the thought of drinking alcohol hadn't crossed my mind a single time.** I looked upon the bottles of liquor with absolute neutrality. Like they were just part of the decor of the pub...props in the background. With this realization I took a long, slow breath and radiated gratitude outwards from my heart into the surrounding universe.    
    
Don't get me wrong: I haven't forgotten where I came from...self-confidence is a good thing to have, but I'm well aware the dangers of hubris and the result of flying too close to the sun. I know in my heart, regardless of how ""neutral"" I feel about alcohol at this point, that I CANNOT drink it. Not even one.   
    
My point of this story is to provide hope: as time passes in sobriety, the weight of addiction will lift...the gravitational pull from the bottle will grow weaker. The Voice that was once so loud in my ear in early recovery has been reduced to nothing more than distant echo of a whisper. The journey down this path gets easier. My step is lighter, my pace is more swift.    
    
**TOOLS I HAVE USED TO GET HERE:**    
    
 * **Recovery Meetings** - For the first year, I thought meetings ""weren't for me."" I had a lot of misconceptions about AA and thought because I wasn't religious, I didn't belong. I was wrong. ""Take what you need and leave the rest"" is a great way to approach meetings. There are also ""free thinkers"" meetings available in most towns that provide a secular view of the program. In the end, meetings provide an important community for us in recovery. Due to the fact that a lot of us combined our social life with our alcoholism, getting sober can be very isolating and lonely. Going to meetings is a fantastic way to build fellowship. Being social produces oxytocin and endorphins in our brains that can make us feel great and fight the anhedonia and depression that is so pervasive in early recovery. There is also a TON of wisdom and experience to be gained from others who are on the same path.    
 * **Meditation** - I always tout mindfulness meditation here on SD. Research has shown that it can boost mood and reduce anxiety significantly. It has had a profound effect on my life and allows me to face even the most difficult anxiety-inducing situations with calm and inner peace. [Here's ""quick start"" guide](https://www.thetadprinciple.com/free-meditation-guide-0101adj.html). Here is a link to free online book called [Mindfulness in Plain English](https://www.vipassana.com/meditation/mindfulness_in_plain_english.php) by Buddhist monk Henepola Gunaratana for a more in-depth look.    
 * **Exercise** - This is a big one. Exercise can help our brains along in the healing process. It releases endorphins, boosts dopamine and can fight cravings. Even a brisk walk for 15 minutes a day can do wonders. Start small if you need to. Yoga has been an incredible addition to my mindfulness practice and is an ass-kicking workout that leaves me feeling really, really good.    
 * **Hobbies** - Alcohol addiction takes up a lot of time. It is incredibly important to fill the void it leaves behind. Boredom is a BIG reason why some folks relapse in early recovery. Make a list of things you've always wanted to learn. Narrow it down. Look up tutorial videos...the internet is full of them.    
 * **Soda water** - Having a zero-calorie NA drink to keep your hands busy is so important. My fridge is stocked with cold cans of flavored soda water at all times. I bring them everywhere...especially to social functions where I know alcohol will be flowing.    
 * **Sweets** - during periods of really hardcore cravings, eating something sweet can crush them 100% of the time. There's a reason why most AA meetings have cookies...    
 * **Gratitude** - Taking the time throughout the day to stop and feel gratitude for all the small things in life can really sculpt sobriety into something special. It's a mindfulness technique that is a extremely effective tool to boost a sense of well being. Whether it's a bird chirping, a maple tree changing colors in the fall, or having a roof over your head; see how many times you can stop throughout the day, take a deep breath, and feel grateful about even the most simple thing.     
 *  **Reading/learning about addiction** - There are tons of books out there that can break down the mechanism of alcohol and how to escape it. *This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace, *Alcohol Explained* by William Porter, *Quit Drinking Without Willpower* by Allen Carr, and *In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts* by Dr. Gabor Maté are excellent books that helped me understand the way my brain works with and without alcohol.    
 * **Therapy** - Everyone should have a therapist, regardless of being in recovery or not. Period.     
 * r/stopdrinking - I can't forget THE biggest tool I have relied on for these 3 years. I wouldn't be here without each and every one of you. This is such an amazing community and I am so grateful to be a part of it.     
    
From the bottom of my heart: thank you, SD.

Actually an article that name dropped this group in particular was what got me to even visit reddit. 

I have worked in the restaurant and bar business for over 10 years and have made some pretty big mistakes in life in that same time period. I have a degree but no real world experience in my field of study and I have found myself in a cycle of getting myself in some sort of trouble with alcohol, wanting to stop (or at least take control of my) drinking, feeling like my daily work environment makes that impossible, I decide to look for jobs in another field. Although I have no felony charges I do have a few misdemeanors on my record. This has impacted my ability to land a job that pays nearly the same as what I’m accustomed to making behind a bar. 

My personal problems aside, I’d say I don’t love what I do for a living but I am very good at it. I do know that taking control of my life is absolutely necessary and it will take hard work. Changing my career path is a part of this but at the moment I need to keep the job I’ve got. Luckily, Of all the bars and restaurants I’ve worked in, my current employment is probably the safest environment for me to attempt to stay sober while literally making drinks for a living. It’s a fancy steakhouse where most of the FOH staff are career servers most of whom are years older than me. Two of those older servers are in recovery and while we are allowed to have a drink after each shift most of the staff, even those that drink, do not indulge. 

I’m sure there are many of you out there that have done some time in the industry or perhaps still work in an environment where alcohol is prevalent. I guess I’m just looking for some pointers. I have absolutely loved reading all of the supportive messages in this group. I am more hopeful today than I was yesterday.",12

     A little about me: I decided to quit drinking and get in shape about 5 years ago. I was 330 lbs and still in that college party lifestyle even at the age of 27.  I had a really bad night of drinking and decided to give it up and get healthy. Fast forward 4 years and I accomplished these goals and more. I lost the weight, got in great shape and hadn’t had a drink and felt great. 
     For whatever reason I always wondered if I could drink and be responsible and not get sucked back into the binge drinking lifestyle I had been so accustomed to. The drinking a ton and feeling mentally and physically for days and sometimes weeks after a weekend. 
   I started drinking again back in June. First just a few then eased back into the culture of going out on weekends and having 4-5 drinks over a 6-8 hour period. I noticed symptoms right away that I shouldn’t be drinking: inmediate headaches, skin redness, feeling of nausea. But, I just kept doing it because I wasn’t an outsider, the sober guy and that non drinker any more. 
     However, I still always had it in the back of my head that I needed to stop and it wasn’t healthy for me mentally and physically. I never wanted to drink or felt the need to, but felt like it helped me be part of my friend group.
    This weekend I got my kick in the ass that alcohol is the problem and I’m done with it forever. I went out and had probably 10-15 drinks and couldn’t control or stop myself and totally blacked out. Luckily my friend got me home. I had an awful hangover, maybe my worst and am still feeling it in my stomach (not hungry kind of nauseous) on Wednesday. 
     What is freaking me out is that I have this feeling I’ve never had in my gut kind of like a pull to drink and was super twitchy last night and couldn’t sleep until I took a lorazepam. Even at my worst in college I never had this pull, I’d just drink on weekends with friends and toss up the bad decisions and amount of drinking on being in college. I haven’t had a drink and won’t do it, but has anyone ever had this feeling of wanting to drink after a super heavy drinking night along with the twitching? What did you do? 

I think it’s alcohol withdrawal of some kind...I hadn’t had a drink before this Saturday in about 10 days for those wondering.

I was always told/taught that alcoholism = someone who does severe damage to their or others' lives due to drinking, which they are unable to stop without help. This is the person who has other people around them begging them to quit.  That was never me. Sadly, people have always said I'm more fun ""after a few."" Boo!    
Through the years, I reached out a few times because I felt like I had become a ""problem drinker."" When I was younger, I put myself in a couple dangerous situations. As I've grown older, my drinking is much more contained but I have experienced that god-awful dread when waking up, wondering what I did in that hour or two I just can't recall, although ""what I did"" was never bad (what the hell is THAT about?).  I had professionals tell me that I did not have an alcohol problem. I felt confused but relieved.   
So, am I correct in believing there is a spectrum and there are no clear cut lines?!  Where is science in all of this? Is there such a thing as controlled drinking? Can a ""problem drinker"" moderate? Are ""problem drinkers"" alcoholics? It's all so fuzzy!   
When I look around at people I know and work with--not necessarily people I have chosen as friends--I would dare to say that at least 50% of them abuse alcohol on a regular basis and maintain the ability to function. Which kind of normalizes unhealthy behaviors.

Whoever reads this, thanks for reading, to anyone thinking of giving up alcohol..do it, although it doesn't sound like it, my life is so much better..in a wholesome, honest way.

I wrote a metaphorical kind of story which details the struggle my thoughts go through while drinking. From start to finish. It’s like a cycle. It is long so i apologize. This is what my brain shows me. Enjoy.,"THE SISYPHUS EFFECT-
A JOURNEY INTO THE MIND OF AN ALCOHOLIC
 
The Mind Of Bliss - Like a child who experiences going to an ice cream shop on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The joy of satisfying that long awaited reward after a successful day of doing the daily activates. That first sip is like an instant relief. A euphoric sensation of freedom. A cut through the fabric of reality. At that moment in time there is nothing that can stop me. No thought or action can betray me. I am invincible. So we pour again.

The Trail - The trail is long and the path is clear. The land is safe and pure. But I know that I need to make it to the end. There is something pulling me down this road. Like a black hole in space nothing can escape. But going down this trail I see to my left and right, entities, fragments of thoughts and sub-conscious ideas. But they are largely ignored for they all face the same direction in which I am heading. Side by side we travel and as I drink, I scarcely notice the trail shrinking to a single point. And all these forms of thought with it. The feeling of vulnerability breathing on my neck. So we pour again.

The Wall - Reaching the end of the trail we look up and are amazed at the sight of a wall. A barrier of sorts. Taller than the eye can see, and beyond it a mystery. Curiosity gets the better of us so we venture closer. As we approach we feel a sense of evil unlike anything we have ever felt before. So we pour from the bottle of invincibility. A Ladder is seen out in the distance. Tall enough to breech this wall. We have to climb. We don’t know why. As we climb we see the entities from our travels pass through the wall effortlessly. As if they were meant to be there. As they pass, they whisper to keep climbing. Something is drawing us to the top. But it is not in sight. So we pour again.

The Great Fissure – Looking above we see a ledge. And on it is a great beast of unimaginable stature. In his hands he holds a large hammer. The sounds of the beast are horrifying yet there is a sense of unity between us. An understanding of sorts. I try not to look at it as we continue to climb. Looking up we start to see a faint end to our long climb. The feeling of the air is thin and cold. An uneasy feeling drapes over us like a suffocating blanket. As we reach the top we are finally standing on top of the wall. We see a sea of black. The smell is putrid and merciless. The sea is teeming with life unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. Disgusting creatures, some writhing in agony as if they have died One-thousand times over. Some just tread the water in their acceptance of defeat. Over the sea is the worst storm imaginable. Flashes of lightning reveal an endless typhoon. The thunder crashes louder than the largest bombs. The wind tosses waves around with ease. And finally as we drink, we spot something out of place. Across this vast body of dreadfulness there is a women. Completely unidentifiable in any way. But we know she is pure. As we turn our head towards this spirit of elegance we feel a sensation of warmth and calm amidst the chaos of the terrible sea. We take comfort in her presence. She draws nearer with every sip and as she does, we notice that she is not alone. Out of the darkness hat terrible beast with unimaginable stature walk with her, his Great hammer clutched in his hands. And an obedient scowl on his face. The Women raises her arms towards the sky, and the beast does the same, hammer in hand as if they were one. A feeling of panic overwhelms us. The women whispers a word. It can barely be heard. The word, “Release.” And in a single second the women throws her arms towards the sea in a violent manner. And simultaneously the beasts hammer crashes with a godly thud. The Wall starts to crack. The sea is emptying. So we pour again.

The Great Flood – We are swept away through the lands we have just traveled. Going back further than where we have started. The sky is black. The storm following us wherever we go. An endless flood sweeping us in all directions, as if it has no plan on taking us anywhere at all. As we struggle to stay above the churning sea of chaos, we feel like something is trying to pull us down. The creatures that the wall once held back are now all around us. Flailing and grabbing at anything they can to get towards us. As they get closer we realize that the faces look very familiar. Almost identical but with deformities of all sorts. They all look like me. They are me. We try to swim away but it’s no use. The current too strong. The storm treating us like a ship without sails. We are tired. We want to give up. We let the creatures take us down into the depths. So we pour again.

The Drowning - We are dragged deeper and deeper. But something is different. We are still alive. Suspended in nothingness. An empty place. An empty feeling. Around me are all the creatures that were once behind the wall. All of them with my face. The expressions on their faces offer a lifetime of stories. Without words I can understand all of them. They look broken and defeated. We are terrified. We try to ignore all that is around us. But their expressions are too powerful. We attempt to escape but that only angers the entities. All they want is to be heard, but it is much too painful. We struggle to make it back to the surface but there is no up or down here, only emptiness. With no escape in sight I close my eyes and drift off into my own nothingness. I am struck by a force that cannot be explained and my eyes open as my body shutters like an earthquake. We are alone again. Staring down a trail. The trail is long and the path is clear. The land is safe and pure. We start our journey down the trail. Like a child who experiences going to an ice cream shop on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. The joy of satisfying that long awaited reward after a successful day of doing the daily activates. That first sip is like an instant relief. A euphoric sensation of freedom. A cut through the fabric of reality. At that moment in time there is nothing that can stop me. No thought or action can betray me. I am invincible. So we pour again.",6

I'm not sure where to start this- as a teenage meth addict, as the mama of a first grader who wrote ""my dad and I watched a movie while mom threw up in the kitchen trash can"", as a parent stumbling around drunkenly at parent teacher conferences, at my ""rock bottom"" or where I am today, 2500 days sober... 

I guess I'll fast forward through the messy stuff and go with today. Life is, of course, unimaginably better. I have a satisfying career rooted in service, my relationship is the best it's ever been and most of all, I am sober. 

It's not as hard as it was the first few days, weeks, months, years. It does get easier, or maybe we just get better at sober life. At a meeting, one guy once said ""my disease it outside the door doing push-ups, waiting to kill me"" and I truly buy into my alcoholism as a progressive disease that will likely kill me if I drink. I don't want to open that door!

Things that have helped- serenity prayer, supportive friends and family, several of the AA prayers (went to some AA but not religiously), couple of bible verses, service and gratitude, Francis of Assisi ""peace"" prayer, exercise, sparkling water, candy, coffee and diet Dr Pepper.

2019-10-23 05:31:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dlwsgo/380_days_today/,380 Days Today,"I hit the one-year mark on October 1st. 

This means I have both succeeded and failed at my goal.

As my handle (and earliest posts) describe, this was supposed to be a one-year plan.

I had quit for a year before and I was going to quit for exactly one year again.

I was going to figure out booze in this year. Really wrap my head around why I drank like such an excessive animal and not like a normal person.

I thought with a year of perspective I could learn to moderate upon my return.

This subreddit and community (this space - and wholesome memes - reaffirms by belief in humanity on the internet) really helped me through the first few months. But you guys also scared the shit out of me. 

Mostly by holding up a mirror.

I was drinking four beer and 500 ml of rye a day when I quit. I had been a heavy drinker for 22 years leading up to that, but by the end, that’s how much it took to get me to feel anything like a decent buzz (and half that much just to feel normal). 

After I quit, I took up swimming as a way to quell my 7 pm restlessness. I went to the pool 309 times in that year. I hadn’t done freestyle in roughly 30 years. So basically, I learned to swim all over again, and my obsessive nature translated into methodical time-keeping and record setting until I was swimming 22-minute kilometres (still a far cry from life-long swimmers but not bad for only seriously swimming for one year). 

I lost 50 lb. I got into the best shape of my adult life. I also started running again in April and got my 5k to under 25 minutes. 

My kids have been following my progress. They tell me that they like me so much better than when I drank, and that they are proud of me.

Right there is the reason I hit 366 days. Forget the fitness. Forget the weight loss. Forget the personal pride. It’s the way the kids said that... how could I possibly go back now?

I’ve had a lot of time to think about addiction this year. I talk about it openly with the kids. I was addicted to booze. I’m also incredibly lucky. I quit cold turkey without any seizures, or serious side effects. I tell the kids all the time that there are genes for addiction (and based on my history - they need to be careful) and some of those genes in some people are so powerful that quitting is physically and psychologically  far more difficult than my experience. Everyone is different. So you have to be super careful with this stuff. 

Do any of you ever feel that you only have a finite number of drinks allotted to you, before you slip too far into the pitcher plant?

I feel like I’ve used all mine up. And if I ever go back, I’ll be right where I started. So I guess I’m just scared, or maybe playing it safe, or just doing the right thing, I don’t know. 

I still have a lot of work to do. I came into last year with a litany of bad habits and vices and I’m slowly whittling them down. But I don’t drink anymore. That was the main one. And with that demon parasite pulled out of my body at last, I’m ready to tackle the others.

I don’t know what my plan is any more. I’m in unchartered territory. I know I won’t drink with you today though. That’s about it.

Thanks.",113
2019-10-23 03:15:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dlvngn/unexpected_expenses_but_im_not_mad_about_it/,Unexpected expenses! But I'm not mad about it!,"Well, it turns out I've lost almost 20 pounds in the six months since I've stopped drinking. At first I thought my pants were just getting stretched from infrequent washing (apartment life without laundry facilities is hard, sue me), but nope, my waist has shrunk 4 inches. Most of my shirts look baggy and unflattering, too. Luckily I haven't spent all my money at the bar, so I can go shopping instead! Going to need to replace quite a lot of clothes, but it's going to be fun!

I was borderline overweight when I quit, so I was motivated to lose some. However, I didn't expect it to happen so quickly or easily! I know this isn't always the case for everyone, so I thank my relative youth (27 years old), genetics, and general interest in nutrition/cooking for helping me along. I haven't been following a strict diet or anything (besides vegetarianism, though I've been that way for years). But basically, not consuming the daily 1,000+ empty calories from alcohol and otherwise subsisting solely on pizza and french fries can really do wonders for the body! 

I try to be gentle with myself, and I definitely have more sugary drinks these days than before. But overall, my whole system seems more in check. My hangovers used to send me into a panic mode - almost like I would ACTUALLY DIE if I didn't consume mozzarella sticks within the hour. These days, I'm automatically reaching for healthier foods without having to think about it. 

It's vain, but I look at pictures of myself from before and never want to go back. It's cliched but true: there's more energy in my eyes now, more life. Slightly less misery. It's kind of painful knowing what was going on in my head when these certain photos were taken. Even in pictures from one of my favorite vacations, I remember feeling so shaky and panicked, hoping we could stop taking group pictures outside so I could get back to the bar. 

Anyway, sobriety has been a crazy rollercoaster, but it's nice seeing a physical manifestation of the mental progress I'm making as well.",8

Ironically I used to drink not to get hurt, not to feel my emotions, to escape them when they were too strong and too sad, but in reality years of booze made me more vulnerable to them.
I regained my life.

Edit: Sorry the poem’s not clear. It pasted it all in one big block. Maybe google it for a clearer picture or go to the link.

“there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him
I say, stay in there
I'm not going to let anybody see you
there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
but I pur whiskey on him and inhale cigarette smoke
and the whores and the bartenders and the grocery clerks
never know that he's in there
there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him
I say
stay down, do you want to mess me up?
you want to screw up the works?
you want to blow my book sales in Europe?
there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
but I'm too clever, I only let him out at night sometimes
when everybody's asleep
I say, I know that you're there
so don't be sad
then I put him back
but he's singing a little in there, I haven't quite let him die
and we sleep together like that with our
secret pact
and it's nice enough to make a man
weep
but I don't weep
do you?”

I found this poem so powerful when I first heard it and was still drinking. It actually made me feel really sad. After all this time not drinking, he’s not free yet. I’m currently seeking help for some underlying mental health issues I’ve had for a while which I now see made it so easy to turn to the drink. The poem’s beautiful, but I’m glad I don’t live that way anymore, even though currently things aren’t too easy either. At least I have some control. 
Here’s a great reading of it on YouTube with plenty of atmosphere. Thank you Mr Bukowski. As someone who struggled with drink yourself, I wonder if this was a cry for help or a way to inspire others.

Why do I keep on drinking when it's clearly fkn killing me.  I ask myself this question over n over as I lay awake in bed not able to sleep at all.

This has to be the last time.  I've had enough seriously I'm not gonna live like this anymore. 
My longest period being sober was 3 months fresh out of rehab. 
I'm just struggling a bit today, practicing self love it is however difficult when you feel so much shame n regret. 
Alcohol is poison. 

Strings to everyone out there.

So I thought it would be an interesting challenge to try and stop drinking for October. So far it has been ok, but i get the occasional cravings. They usually subside with a nice cup of tea. I never really considered myself addicted to alcohol, but certainly I would benefit from more conscious consumption.

I told my GF that I was quitting the booze for October and she was very supportive, but I was clear that it was just for a month. She won't drink when I am around and supports the month off 100%.

Thing is, we have a big Halloween party coming up on Nov 1st and I already let slip that I was looking forward to having a drink.

Would this make my month off booze a success, or my quitting booze a failure?

To be completely honest with myself, I dont think i really quit because I wanted to, I pretty much said I was taking a month off without really thinking about it. Im more sticking to it because I keep my word and do the things I say I am going to do, not because I actually wanted to quit drinking. 

However, with all the positives of going without the drink, im thinking I should ride this healthy train long term.

What do you think?",3

Over the last couple of days, I started talking about what I am going through with my immediate family, as they had no idea at all. It was scary and I was ashamed/embarrassed, but the overall reaction has been supportive. However, my family (myself included) has always been more on the pessimistic side of life, but getting myself on the right track has me very optimistic. It was frustrating that the first thing said in these conversations were along the lines of, “Well it’s not going to be this easy forever”, “It’s only a matter of time before you sink again”, and “It’s not always going to be smooth sailing like this”. I am aware that it will get hard at times, but I wasn’t expecting that kind of reaction from my family right off the bat. At first I was kind of just pissed at them. But when I cooled off a bit, I realized they really do have my best interest in mind and do want me to succeed even if they had a weird way of putting it right off the bat.

But!! That got me thinking. They are right that at some point it will be harder than it is right now, so why not prepare myself for it? I’ve gotten so much support from this group already, and I would love to gather any tips that might help others and myself out when we get to the inevitable ‘down days’.

What did you do that you found effective?

Did some things help more than others?

What are some triggers/situations you would recommend avoiding during this time?

Any easy activities that helped keep your mind distracted?

Any good movies or books that you would recommend for easy entertainment? 

Any good beginner work out routines that you would recommend? (ones that can be done at home and at a gym?)

What do you wish you knew before you ‘hit a bump in the road’? 

I know it’s a lot of questions, I’m just trying to cover all of my bases. Haha. 

Thanks in advance for any help you have to offer those of us still in the early stages! 🙏🏻 You guys are all  amazing.

My reasons for quitting don't feel strong enough. It's why I've struggled to let it go in the past. Honestly I don't even know what self respect feels like so that's not enough of a pull either.

I have gotten drunk three times this year, for about three weeks at a time, and ended up in the ER every time.

Posted it on social media, because something about doing so makes it more real. When the world can see you, when it's out, that's when it feels realest. 

To all who are struggling, I say fight. Fight like your life fucking depends on it. Win. Win or go down swinging. This is your life. It exists for you to mold, create, or destroy as you please. You can do this.

Today on my sober anniversary, I've reignited the fire I needed. I got an offer to give a speech to some at risk youth about the dangers of addiction, and I'm going to do it. I'm going to finish my book and get it to the editor. I'm going to open a new bank account and start investing in my future. And I'm asking the next pretty girl I see if she wants some coffee. 

Anyways, here's the letter. Hope some of you vibe with it.



I used to drink 4 to 6 drinks a day. More on the weekends. That's 1,460 shots I didn't drink over the last year, at minimum. 17.1 gallons of liquor. At minimum. The thing you start to see when you destroy who you thought you were and invent someone new, is just how much of the world around you was built on an ugly lie. How many places the new you has no business going to. People the new you has no business being around. And so, over the last year, many relationships I've had have gone the way of that 17.1 gallons of liquor. Into somebody else's life. And I wish them all well. Because one year ago today, I woke up sweating and shaking and violently ill, my heart racing and my head pounding as I puked my morning away. And all I could bring myself to do was cry. Puke and cry and ask myself what the fuck had gone wrong. I was alone. So deeply, profoundly alone that even I had abandoned myself. And shaking, wiping tears from my eyes and puke from my lips, I swore this would never happen again. I would never abandon myself, not for drink, not for love, not for any force in the universe, ever again. And while the last year has had it's ups and downs, I kept my promise. Quitting drinking wasn't about drinking. It was about cowardice. It was about running from my problems, about being too weak to look myself in the eyes and face up to what I had become. I find myself this morning, alone again. But now, I'm alone by design. I'm alone because there is too much work to be done, and not nearly enough time in which to do it. I'm alone, but infinitely less alone than I was one year ago, because now, I'm here for me. And what I've come to realize over the last 365 days, is that I am all I really need. Thank you, one year ago me. You're my hero. You saved my life. And I'm going to try and live today in a way that enables me to say the same thing next year.",18

Then at lunch i watched a guy dressed in business attire at a wawa buying a 24oz beer. That used to be me. Not that bery long ago. 

I started thinking about all the dumb shit i did to hide alcohol; bottles in my truck, bottles in various hockey bags, bottles in tool  boxes. And when the visible bottle was getting low i would find a way to fill it up without looking like a brand new bottle but rather a casual consumption bottle.

I finally sought help for my underlying depression and was advised not to go cold turkey but to cut back to avoid withdrawal symptoms. However drinking in moderation is just impossible. So I decided recently to stop altogether. I did ok for a few nights then relapsed, this kept happening. 

Last night was particularly challenging with the kids, I was craving a drink so badly. But I ended up falling asleep with the kids at bedtime. When I woke up again at 11pm, I had the choice to get up to get the drink I wanted and do the chores but for once, I chose to go back to sleep.

When I got out of my car, the man’s wife was out there finishing with the leaves and said her husband had been drunk while doing yard work (and that he frequently does this and gets injured) and it just... really hit home. 

I’ve been trying to take walks through different parts of the neighborhood instead of walk my dog to the beer store after work (where I would buy my nightly bottle of wine and get smashed).

I told her I was on day 15 and have really been trying to get sober seriously this time. She gave me a big hug and said I could come by any time- they’re retired and always home.

I had a weird day. My needlessly epic divorce seems to be limping towards its conclusion. The whole thing seems a little surreal. I had a courtroom thing downtown today, and when I got to the civic center where the courtroom was located, for no explainable reason there was a Michael Jackson impersonator dancing and singing to ‘Billie Jean’ on a stage in the lobby. So I got to watch that while I was going through security. That didn’t help matters any.

I got about an hour’s break in the middle of everything, so I walked over to the local AA Service Office to browse the bookstore. And I ran into a woman who’s started coming to the Tuesday night meeting that I chair, who happened to be volunteering in the service office. It was so nice to see a friendly face and get a hug. 

And it made such a difference to me. It reminded me that my life has value and that there are people who love me. It reminded me that what is important is the life that I have moving forward. It also made me grateful for my sobriety. 

Sobriety is something that I get to have now, it’s not something that I have to do. I get to walk through this sober. I get to be present in it. And because I’m present in it, I get to choose. I get to choose how I want to act and what I want to do. No matter what anyone else does, I get to choose what I do. I get to choose what I want to live with and how I want to be as a person.

Alcohol took that away from me. I wasn’t always present. I didn’t always choose. Even when I wasn’t intoxicated, I wasn’t always a person I would want to be. I’m still not always the person who I want to be in sobriety, but I get to choose, and having choice means that I can stop what I’m doing and change direction.

A day like this would’ve been a no-brainer drinking day while I was still drinking. I probably would’ve been drinking the night before, and rolled into court a jangle-nerved, hungover wreck. And I *definitely* would’ve been drinking tonight. Definitely ‘till blackout, most likely alone, magnifying my pain by running away.

I’m not drinking tonight, and I’m fine. I know that I can get through this sober. I know that I have support. I know that I will be okay. And I’ve got my meeting to chair later. It’s a meeting that a lot of newly sober people come to, which is perfect. 

Out of self and into others, that’s exactly what I need. If I’m able to be of service to someone else, to connect with what’s going on with them, if I’m able to share honestly about what’s going on with me and who I am, I will feel okay. 

That’s where the *real* relief lies for me these days. I can get out of my head and think about other people for an hour and a half, and everything will change. It will give me relief, and my thinking and how I feel will actually change. I don’t have any impulse to drink because I don’t have any need to run away. 

Anyway, I hope that you all are well. Thank you all for being here with me. I’m so grateful for the support that I get on here and in my real life recovery community. And thank you all for sharing about what you’re going through, and where you’re at. It helps me to remember that my life doesn’t happen in my own head, it happens in connection with others.

I've been drinking myself to sleep every night for far too long. I'd reached a point of complete emotional exhaustion and knew I had to quit.  I was tired of the constant trips to the liquor store, pounding coffee every morning to ward off the hangover so I could get through the day and make it back home just to crack open the bottle for a few hours away from reality. I was tired of the fear that set in as the hangover faded, worrying how long it would be before the health effects from my nightly routine would finally catch up to me.

When I got to the ER I told them everything, how much I'd been drinking and how I was ready to stop.  The doctors were wonderful and wrote me a script to help with withdraw. 

Even with the medicine, this has not been easy, I've still been craving a drink.  I've had more chocolate and seltzer water than I've ever had the inclination to consume before.  

Even still, I'm beginning to feel a clarity I haven't felt in the years and I'm looking forward to a sober future. 

I want to thank everyone in this sub for sharing their stories and support and it's a large part as to why I chose to finally make the decision to kick this habit.",21

The observant and upstanding young woman at the register prevented me from buying a handle of bottom shelf vodka, and as annoyed as I was walking out of the store, I'm thankful today. That's not to say I didn't still drink last night - I did - but I wasn't even enjoying it. I drank out of some misplaced sense of rebellion, with an attitude of ""you can't stop me."" 

But the ""you"" wasn't a parent, or a friend, or a god. I was rebelling against my own best interests and my conscience, the last thing looking out for me. 

I remember the comfort I felt holding that bottle of vodka. ""This is it,"" I thought. ""At least with this, I know what I'm living for."" 

I don't know how to fix this, I don't know what to do. I've made so many declarations of being done that the sentiment is rendered vacuous. I get that the point of IWNDWYT is to break down the massive goal of lifetime sobriety into manageable day-to-day goals, yet I've not made it past day 2. 

I need help. I'm more scared now of what will become of me if I stay on this path than I am of making myself vulnerable and taking responsibility for the emotional labor of those who help someone at the precipice of self-destruction. I don't want to be this person, this hermit who asks for help yet shrinks away when he gets it, continuing the cycle. 

I have everything to lose if I don't get this right. So in that spirit, I will not drink with you today.",7

I’ve always used drinking as a way to motivate myself, which might sound strange. But if I had some mundane task to do, like cleaning the house, working in the yard, laundry, etc — Alcohol was a way to make it more enjoyable. It actually gave me energy rather than slowing me down. 

But worse than that, I’ve also relied on it for my creative endeavors. I’m a musician with a home studio, so I record my own music as well as other bands. Every time I walk past my studio, this feeling of dread comes over me. I literally cannot imagine going in there and working — my motivation is completely gone. I have a full-time career, so it’s not like I’m worried about my livelihood. But still... I hate this.

It seems obvious to me that feelings like this will get easier, but there’s a strong part of me that isn’t so sure. I just don’t know.

I’m not looking for pity, just needed to vent. These are the kinds of weird feelings that most people don’t understand about alcoholism.",18

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  *Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink.* It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

**What happens if we can't keep to our pledge?** We give up and then try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at: US - Night/Early Morning Europe - Morning Asia and Australia - Evening/Night A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

I also apologised for my substance issues. I said that at least with my drinking though I was hurting myself and not hurting anyone else ( he was abusive). 

Anyway, not really sure where I’m going with this post. It’s 5am here and I have already been in floods of tears and now I have to go to work.

I am proud of myself for really  trying to take control of my issues though. He sounds like he’s still in denial about his. I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before he punches someone else.

It’s becoming clear to my now how drinking effected my self esteem and contributed to me staying with someone like that when I deserved so much more. It’s makes me so sad.

I wrote that resetting a badge wasn't mandatory.  A fair amount of anger ensued and the balance of votes earned me the top comment. 

1.  I am inspired by every nondrinker/alcohol-free/struggling person on this sub.

2.  I sometimes think an alcoholic beverage would be really nice and fun, but so far, I am dedicated to personally feel the long-term effects of complete abstinence....I'm only 3 months into a much longer journey.

3.  Life in every aspect has improved measurably, and thus reinforcing abstinence.

4.  I do not believe that one shitty night out of more than 50, 100, 500, or n should redefine a person's commitment to being alcohol-free and thus make them unethical, uncommitted, or an imposter in this sub by not resetting a badge (this sub is special because it is not a pious/dogmatic AA community).

5.  Moderation of my drinking did not seem feasible, and the real-life stories on this sub are inspiring me to reach deeper into sober life, live without a crutch that readily becomes an addiction, and not hit rock-bottom by pretending life was not negatively impacted by my alcohol dependence.

6.  I knew a priori that my feedback would personally insult some members for my ""naivety"" with real-life addiction.  However, I like testing hypotheses.   I support Recovery by being supportive of a Process/Path rather than adhering to ""only one true road to recovery"".

7.  In conclusion, this sub is the most useful and beneficial support group I've ever participated in (AA, Secular AA, Humanist Society support groups, etc are in my repertoire).  Here, we will debateh here, we will support each otherh here, we will share truths; here, we will be transparent with our lives/addictions/advice; and here, we will find the corroborating evidence to overcome our respective addictions to alcohol.

I could not continue to be successful in my fight with alcohol addiction without this sub being exactly as it is.  If this post (one in an ocean of goodwill) helps you understand why r/stopdrinking is vital to this world we (will) love, then I am truthfully just another fish in a school of others that really, really, really care about you becoming free from alcohol addiction.",65

I've been chronically depressed since that age too, strange how this coincidence never really clicked. 

I have a decent job, good family, not many friends but that's not unusual considering the isolated state I've pushed myself into. I've just realised that the last 20 years have been nothing experiences. I can't remember the last time I experienced pleasure, happiness or joy. I've been living in a constant state of Anhedonia for as long as I can remember. I've found whisky to be the most effective tool that lifts my mood, I'll generally mix it with codeine. A litre will last me 2 days typically, I usually drink after work and keep going until I black out on the sofa. 

I'm at the point now where I'm in debt, hugely. My company I work for is going bust (it's my job to get the company profitable, and I can't raise the motivation to tackle it). I just don't give a shit about any of these problems, I know they're serious but I'm apathetic and indifferent to it. I don't care I'm about to lose my job, my house, I don't care I can't pay my bills or my debts. I literally don't care about anything anymore. I think about suicide every day, how to do it, where to do it.

I suffered some kind of optical/neuro disturbance last week, symptoms were identical to an optical migraine (which is unlikely as I've never had that before), another alternative would be a mini stroke. This put a few things into perspective.

So I was on a plane last week for work, I had some time to kill at the airport and googled 'giving up booze' or something to that effect... I found Allen Carr's Easy way to stop drinking, downloaded it and read the whole book on the plane. I've gotta say it is by far the most convincing book I've read so far.

I've decided to quit, for good. If I don't do this now, there are only darker places ahead. I'm curious to know if my depression and anhedonia is related to my alcohol abuse, if so then what keeps me going is the promise of a new life waiting for me, one where I can actually feel joy again naturally. It's been... 3 days so far, I'd like to know how others have found giving up to effect your mood? Do you find it easier to get pleasure from everyday things, interests etc?",15

It was so hard to stop drinking, it took everything I had, that in that act, I spent what was my old self in the process, and what was left was completely new, changed, and different.  Giving everything I had, I got something different in return.  Someone who honestly feels like that cannot be stopped.  I wanted to share, and maybe that will help someone.

I am curious to know what your first time attending a meeting was like. 

I am currently 326 days sober. I’m eyeing the 1 year mark.. it’s so hard to believe. But I’ve never been to a meeting. I got this far on my own (and with the help of this sub). But I really wish I had a support system in my life. 

I’ve tried to tell my family. My parents seem in denial, after a couple attempts to explain my drinking problem and where I’m at now,  it’s clear that they don’t understand. That’s okay, and I’ve accepted that, but I’m afraid of life changes/hardships that will come and my lack of tangible support for my sobriety. 

Last week, I had a challenging time in my relationship, and I was the closest to drinking that l’ve been in months. When I felt myself panicking and wanting to drink, I thought to myself how I have no one to talk to. Not one person I could text or call or one place I could go for support. 

I’m scared to go to a meeting. I have anxiety about irrational things like not being accepted, or people seeing me and thinking I don’t belong there.

I have felt so insecure, uneasy for years, like something was wrong.  I am just in a flow state lately, and things are going so much more smoothly.  I feel I am totally radiating a calmer, more mature and confident aura.  I feel like strangers talk to and smile at me more, it's just been crazy

I have distinctly had like a deja vu feeling in recovery, like fuck, I feel 19 again, like my brain is back online, dusting off the adult mode that had been paused or muted by the numbing escape of addiction

I don't know if I'll ever ""catch up"" to where I could, or should be, I could never really know that anyway, but this newfound state of mind is totally due to my sobriety, and living a recovery lifestyle.  If I was still drinking and using, or was just ""dry"" and not putting in any work, I think I would still be stunted.  Again, I am so grateful and in awe of this growth, it's amazing how much potential and healing our body and minds are capable of.

I wanted to post this as a sort of personal recap/ how I am feeling, so that I may look back on this in times of need.

If anyone is lurking, or doesn't quite want to post anything, that is very normal. It look me months of struggling, planning to quit ""tomorrow"", etc.. to actually post anything here. It was hard to admit to myself, and commit, but it was totally worth it. The overwhelming kindness and support was amazing. The advice and stories helped a ton to help me make the right choices going forward.

Yesterday I was the most hungover I had ever been. I barely remember Sunday evening, I dont remember taking a shower or laying my kids to sleep. I do remember lying to my wife about why half the bottle of whisky was gone, and then admitting that I lied and being too drunk to talk coherently. I do remember her telling me how mad she was, and that I should go to bed. I do remember waking up of the couch, mouth dry, head pounding, not knowing how I got there. I remeber my kid not being in his crib and panicking. Turns out he climbed out of his crib and was screaming in the living room and I was too drunk on the couch to even hear him. Yesterday was rough, I didn't puke, but I wanted to so badly just to make the stomach pain stop. I got through the day, nibbled on some food at lunch but the stomach pain was almost unbearable and the room kept spinning, I definitely couldn't bend over. I finally got home and was able to take a family walk around the neighborhood. I took 2 bites of dinner, and couldn't stomach anymore. We did our evening routine, started stranger things season 3, got the kids to bed and then I went to bed myself. I read through the comments from my post from yesterday and said I can do this! Sleep was turbulent, but the stomach pain slowly subsided and I got some rest.
     This morning day 2, woke up not hungover but a little cloudy. Cloudy beats hungover by a billion times! Now, the embarrassing thoughts keep rolling in. I cant believe I couldn't build shelves in the garage and organize because I got drunk on liquor Sunday and lied about it to my wife's. Everytime I see my garage, I'll be reminded of this event. I can't believe I talked to a few of my neighbors in the state I was in Sunday. 

I know the embarrassing thoughts will subside, but I'm glad they exist to remind me of what happens when I lose control. I am making active strides in my life to never end up like that again. This weekend will be the big test, but I know I can it, I have to do it, because I can't accept the alternative. 

I appologize for the long, rambling post. Thank you for everyone's support!

*But when do the urges stop?*  

I quit a lot of other nasty habits when I quit drinking, like smoking and using cocaine. I haven't missed either of those at all, but damn do I miss drinking! I am not afraid of my urges. Like I mentioned earlier I am too driven to succeed to even think about failing. It would just be a little easier (who am I kidding, A LOT EASIER), if I wasn't being bombarded by the craving to drink every night.

It's the first time I've gone over a week without drinking that I can remember. It's also the first time where I've had a break and not been chomping at the bit in anticipation of my first drink after the self-imposed X amount of time has elapsed.

&#x200B;

I've actually taken some stuff I've read here to heart. Take it 'day by day' in the literal sense. I haven't FORBIDDEN ALCOHOL FROM THE REST OF MY LIFE, I've just decided that I don't currently want or need it. I haven't even said I'm on a break until XX date. Just trying not to for awhile. I know I will again at some point, and likely sooner rather than later (long planned visit from one of my oldest friends/drinking buddies in 2 weeksish, if I even go/get that far), but that's fine. A sense of perspective and distance is good. I don't really know what I want out of this break. Partly it's to prove to myself that I can take a break from it, as well as to help shed a few beer belly lbs.

&#x200B;

Usually my breaks are preceded by a feeling of going too hard for too long, usually with a final blowout that leaves me feeling like death for the first few days of the break. This time, though, I just kind of felt like doing it. I've been drinking less, if anything, for the month prior or so (but still every day). It's given this stint of sobriety a stranger feeling. I went into it without feeling like my very organs were poisoned and my soul was tainted for once.

&#x200B;

On one or two days, I've woken up and not wanted to open my eyes and my mouth has felt dry and awful, and in my head I'm going 'god, what time did I pass out last night?' then I wake up and realise I went to bed at 11, with a cup of hot cocoa and a clear head. It usually clears in 15 minutes and I feel energetic again (unlike the long slog of a hangover where often enough, the fog doesn't fully clear until I've had another drink that evening). It's a feeling I'd kind of forgotten about: sobriety doesn't mean boundless energy and no need for ample sleep (but maybe that's just a part of not being in my early twenties anymore too!). I've also rediscovered my love of painfully spicy food. If I was drinking, I'd avoid super spicy food because it would slow down the drinking I'd try to squeeze into the after-work-but-before-it's-too-late hours.

&#x200B;

Writing this has actually given me more of a craving to have a drink than I've had in the last 8 days, weirdly. Just from thinking about it so much, I guess, plus I saw earlier that the store had a great deal on the beer I like. But I'm not going to drink today, and I'm glad of the feeling that I can decide that, as there have been periods in my life where ensuring the availability of alcohol has been forefront of my mind. This has been rambling and without much point but I thought I'd share.",12

It has torn up my family, yet I still struggle daily to find the will to give it up.  I've started thinking that I've just been wasting money on a therapist and medications.  I need to find the will myself to stop - the person I have always been and the things I've accomplished, I've done myself.  I'm too head strong and its just that I keep telling myself whatever the therapist is telling me are things I would normally tell others who need help, so why cant I just tell myself?

Ideally, I would love to be locked up in my room for a week or two, no car, no money, nothing.  Break the pattern of drinking and see what happens. I just feel like talking about my alcoholism to anyone just makes me want it more.  If I'm just cut off communication with everyone for a period of time, I wont think about alcohol.  I cant do meetings because again, makes me think of alcohol and want it more.  

Alternatively,  lets say I get one day a week at home by myself just to drink no family, no friends, nothing. Wife and kids stay at inlaws or I'd get a hotel room. I feel like something like that would give me the drive to work hard during the week, as I'll have something to look forward to.  Can this work??   Gradually maybe then do it once a month.

I made it through 7 days of being encouraged to drink from 11am onwards with relatively little struggle (I'm very proud of myself), but I'm back now on day 24 and for some reason the craving just hit me like a truck.

It started last night when I landed, just a need to unwind and not think for a couple of hours. Now I'm on a train back home and it's all I can think about - not the taste of it, just the way it made me feel. It feels like there's this big bundle of mess in my chest and if I don't quiet it I'm going to scream. I think part of me just wants to see me fail, like I was expecting to on vacation and my brain can't handle that I'm actually doing well for once.

Here are my observations.,"After doing brief stints in the past of sober weeks or a month (where I'd barely make it to 30 days, and once it was over I'd go very hard back into habits), I finally committed myself to just. keep. going. It wasn't an easy summer.

My dad actually passed away a couple months ago (though it's ok, he was suffering from various health complications and we saw it coming for the past year). On top of that, work (as a freelancer) has been slow, and a lot of my friends have kind of faded away because they were all drinking buddies, so it's been quiet and lonely and kinda boring these days. All of this a recipe to get hammered and stay hammered. But I told myself no, it won't solve anything, and just powered through. Somehow. I'm glad I did.

**I think the biggest most obvious and amazing changes I can point to are:**

\- I've lost a lot of weight, which I needed to. I developed a big beer belly over the years, and now I can actually fit all my old clothes, and I've been told I look younger and healthier by people I know. Not to mention, I'm eating healthier just as a result of not eating light night pizza or greasy breakfast sandwiches every hungover morning.

\- Insomnia isn't really a thing anymore! I wasn't necessarily the type to drink all day, I mostly started drinking every evening to help me fall asleep. I knew all the research that says alcohol disturbs your sleep, but all the facts and figures be damned: I was pretty much an insomniac without alcohol, and it got to the point where I had to get pretty drunk just to pass out. I'm amazed, now, how I simply just fall asleep, out like a baby, often before midnight. I had no idea the insomnia was pretty much caused by the drinking, and I found myself in the grasp of a vicious cycle.

\- When I get anxious and depressed, two things that I medicated using alcohol, I've discovered the following things work BETTER and don't give me hangovers: exercise, meditation, reading, writing, playing piano.

\- Best of all, my cravings simply have changed. In those first few weeks, it's hard as shit to not want a drink, every time you see people at the window of a bar laughing with friends and such. But as the months went on, and now at 6 months, I don't even really crave it at all. I've been to bars a small handful of times this summer for birthday parties or to meet someone, and I've been completely happy having a seltzer+lime or mocktails, and not once has anyone judged or pressured me. I crave waking up early, exercise, and creative hobbies, far too much to have a drink. When I quit drinking, I thought there would always be this craving that would haunt me everywhere I'd go. And sure, there are still some warm beautiful days where a tall, cold, crisp pilsner sounds amazing. But soon, that desire passes like the wind, and it's gone. I remember how much more I like life this way. :)",392

That's the longest I've been without alcohol since I was at least 18 (I'm 37), as even when I was able to moderate I drank once a week and in college about once a month. I lost my moderation skills about 4 years ago during my divorce.

My SO had to go to the Czech Republic for work this week, so I decided to tag along long before I quit drinking. As a long time beer fan (and not just for the buzz) I was excited to learn that they have a thriving non-alcoholic craft beer scene here. The little grocery store under our flat has the big names (like Heineken 0.0) but also about 8 small Czech brands of NA beer. I've also seen at least one (and typically 2-3) NA beverage offerings aimed at adults at every dinner. We even went to a restaurant with it's own vineyard and they offer fresh, organic, white grape juice mixed with soda water as a spritzer. Super tasty. That's the easy part of the story.

The hard part has been the UNENDING offering of free booze. Even before I quit drinking I let finances control my binge but free booze is another level. Our rental flat has SIX bottles of vodka under the sink, as well a 6L of expensive beer and a bottle of wine that we are allowed to partake in. While making lunch just now I found a tiny bottle of expensive whiskey in the fridge. (Whiskey is my black out beverage of choice.) After eating I got back to the bedroom where I'm working and the host stopped by to bring some extra towels he promised us yesterday as well as an expensive bottle of wine as a ""sorry I forgot the towels yesterday"" gift. 

So I let out a LOUD sigh after he left and cracked open a 0.5L can of Heineken 0.0. The taste is right, the feel is right, and I'm happy. I really don't need alcohol. And the best part, without the addictive buzz, I'm happy with one, just like I would be with one Coca-cola. 

Thank you all for being here and for getting me through a rough spot on an otherwise lovely trip. I'm not in danger of drinking, I really am seeing the other side with good sleep, FAR less anxiety, and normal happy poops. I will not drink with you today.",11

I tried to pay for my Sprite, which was met with the barkeep (a regular customer at my restaurant) telling me to ""get a fucking hobby"". I almost get a fucking rush out of not drinking *at the bar*. I have started reading like I used to. I have been in love with Carl  Jung's Liber Novus, and Still Life With Woodpecker by Tom Robbins (both reccomended). I lost more than ten pounds not drinking and eating better, which means I have to replace a lot of my clothes, and can wear more of the things I actually like. 

Thank you guys. Thank you for getting me through a really shit time. I feel better, I look better, and I do better. I may not post as much, because I dont think about it much anymore, but I'll still be reading your stories! Thank you all a thousand times.",61

On my side I have the fact that I gave up smoking three weeks ago (for the second time, first time was 9 months and I relapsed). I believe this time it's for good.

Having a social drink is part of my culture, family and friend group. Asking myself to simply stop drinking alone is nowhere near as challenging as what some people here are managing. I'm hoping it can develop into a general moderation across the board, but this is my starting point.

Just checking in; feeling horrid and trying get re-centered to avoid losing any more days to this hangover. Back on day two, after a pretty good run, followed by a pretty spectacular bender. 

I did learn something from this one. After a couple months off, I CAN have a couple beers, and even a good time. The first time. Once. But the escalation is SO FAST and so ABRUPT. The cycle: abstain/""try"" a couple to see if I'm cured/ramp up/fall hard: it's getting shorter and more desperate. This time I found myself drinking whiskey. I HATE whiskey, but I promised my husband I wouldn't BUY any more alcohol to drink at home, and...well, we already had this leftover from a party MONTHS ago. I had an AHA moment while I was gagging down the first drink so that I could ""enjoy"" the rest, although the realization didn't stop me from finishing the bottle. I also know for a fact that I'll never be ""cured,"" because I don't drink to enjoy having a drink, I drink to get drunk.

The mini rock-bottom was what should/would have been a lovely evening at our friend's, who made a really nice dinner. I drank way too much, have no idea what I said, and I'm afraid to ask. I try to make an initial gauge of what MIGHT have happened based on my husbands behavior the next day,  and he seemed fine and said something along the lines of ""Tomorrow's a new day, don't beat yourself up, just move on think about what you need to do."" So stoic. I guess first on the list is finding my keys and wallet that I lost two days ago. 

Anyway, I read posts like this all the time, and usually I'm like, damn dude, thanks for the reminder. But I conveniently forget when it suits me, but it's not really that I forget. It's more like a different part of my brain takes over and tells me what to do, and blocks out any relevant information that my rational, sober self might chip in. The scariest part is how confident I am right now that this is the last time. But I'm always confident that that was the last time, and here we are. 

I'm supposed to see our host from this weekend today, and I'm nervous about it. He is a really nice guy, and I know how obnoxious I am when I'm blackout, white girl wasted and I'm mortified about my potential (probable) behavior. 

&#x200B;

AH. Anyway. Thank you for being here. Knowing someone will read this and understand what I'm feeling is comforting. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bonus material cause this is already tool long:   
I thought of an analogy last night, lying in bed awake beating myself up and trying to find some excuse or explanation for my behavior.  When ""normal"" people drink, it's like they're controlling a thermostat. They turn on the heat, get it to a comfortable temperature, and hold it there. I'm a house fire. I light a tiny piece of kindling, and then the whole thing burns hot and fast and out of control until there's no fuel left. The only way to control it is to put it out completely, or never allow it to be lit in the first place.",2

YET.,"Due to many reasons that I don't really want to get into right now, I struggle with telling a lot of my friends that I am not drinking TODAY. 

This community has been so helpful during my sober journey, I figured I would ask the question here: How do I get out of a monthly get-together with 2 really close friends of mine without insulting them or alienating them?

Every third Wednesday of the month we go out for shots and beer and wings... The last time I met with them, I had a headache and a sore throat (seasonal allergy-related), so I used that as an excuse/legitimate reason to not drink then. They found it odd that I was not drinking because I am usually the one that gets the drunkest. This time around, my friends proceeded to get blasted while I stayed sober. I was not craving alcohol because I am one of the lucky ones that has been able to stop and stay stopped. 

Aaanyway, tomorrow is our next monthly get-together... 

I really don't want to go out again and watch them drink while I sit ""alone"" in my sobriety. Telling them I'm not feeling well isn't going to fly because I don't ever get sick (knock on wood). 

What should I do? What should I say? How do I bail without insulting them???

I know there are two schools of thought in the sober community: to completely avoid people, places, and things... or go out as usual, say I am not drinking today, and roll with it. 

Can someone give me some advice? Can someone help me make a legitimate excuse to get out of this get-together?

Just for some perspective, 75% of me wants to just cancel going altogether, while the other 25% of me is willing to go anyway because I feel REALLY guilty bailing on my friends. I have known them for most of my life, so it is not like I could just brush them off and cut them out completely.

Thank you all in advance!",4

2019-10-22 08:05:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dlgy5a/weekends_parties_holidaystips_to_make_it_through/,"Weekends, parties, Holidays....tips to make it through","Weekends tend to be the hardest time to stay sober and with holidays coming let's include them as well 
Here's some tips I have found that may help, pick one or use them all, most important thing over all is your sobriety. Keep it as priority #1, even over having fun.  This list helped me so much in early recovery. 


•Do I have to go?"" First and foremost, determine if there is a valid reason for attending this event. Is it to mark a very important, once-in-a-lifetime occasion for a very dear loved one? Required by work? Required by law? I can't think of very many other reasons one would have to go to an event. Birthday? They'll have another one next year. Wedding of second cousin? If they're not close to you, they probably won't notice if you're not there. Christmas? Again, that will happen next year, too. Early sobriety is about you. It's about saving your life. Be a little selfish. If you can back out of a difficult event, do it. It's not forever, it's just while you get your sober muscles good and strong.

•Bring a sober support. If you can, bring someone who is on your team and who can help you remember why you are doing what you are doing.

•Set a time limit. Get there late, leave early. Determine ahead of time what a realistic amount of time you can resist temptation is. One hour? Two? Plan to stay only as long as needed for the most important parts of the event, then stick to that plan. If you're worried about what the host(ess) will say, tell them ahead of time that you will have to leave by _____ o'clock. Make up an excuse if you want. Still feeling strong when the pre-set time comes up? Don't tempt fate; leave on a high note.

•Plan what you will drink. Your host(ess) wants you to feel comfortable and welcome. That usually includes offering you a drink. Maybe it's a hot day; you will want something to wet your whistle. What will it be? Ginger ale? Club soda and cran? Sparkling water? Know this ahead of time, that way when someone says ""Can I get you a drink?"" you can confidently and without pause say ""Oh, why, yes please. I'd love a Sprite."" If you're worried that everyone else will have a cocktail glass and you won't, ask the bartender to put your drink in a rocks glass. If you don't think it's likely that there will be non-alcoholic beverages available, bring your own lovely bottle of seltzer water with you.

•Remember HALT. H=Hungry, A=Angry, L=Lonely, T=Tired. Eat a high-protein snack before you go and avoid sweets at the event as they can create a blood-sugar crash that leads to alcohol craving. Release yourself from resentment or anger that ""everyone else gets to drink and have a good time"" and you don't. You know you don't have a good time when you drink, you have a hangover and a feeling of defeat.

•Lonely? Talk to people and have a good time. Hey, you're gonna remember this in the morning! If you need to, duck into a corner and call a sober friend, do it.

•Check in with a sober support before and after the event. Call and get (or give yourself) a little pep-talk right before you go or even in the parking lot. Have them on-call in case things get rough (remember that lonely thing?). Then, call afterwards to tell them what a rockin' job you did staying sober. If you can't find someone to do this for you (I bet you can), come here and post before and after.

•Take a time-out. Plan a little self-care halfway through the event if it is long, and give yourself a break if you need it. Sit in a bathroom stall and read a few motivational quotes on your phone. Call your sober support or, if you have one with you, pull them aside for a little check-in. Find a quiet corner to take deep breaths. Step outside and do a quick meditation. Sit in your car and listen to an inspiring song.

•Emergency Exit Strategy. This is not the time to ride-share. If you have a car, drive it and don't give anyone a ride to or from (except your sober support). If you get in a pinch and have to leave, you do not want to have to wait for someone to be ready or have someone convince you to stay ""just a little bit longer."" If you must ride with someone else, make sure they know your planned departure time and are willing to stick to it. Plan alternate means of getting home in case they flake, including having the phone number and enough cash for a cab ride home or the current bus schedule and bus fare.

•Plan/journal/visualize your success. Your head is probably full of all the bad stuff that could happen. Focus on what it will be like if you follow your plan, meet your goals, and have a fabulous time. Meditate on it, write the story in your journal, visualize it for a few days beforehand. Go into the event with that feeling of success and accomplishment already with you.

•""Why aren't you drinking?"" Trust me on this one, you are thinking about your drinking way more than anyone else. Most people are concerned about having their drink; they probably won't care about yours. But let's make a plan just in case. Practice a simple response like ""I don't feel like drinking tonight"" or ""drinking just doesn't agree with me anymore."" You have spent enough years justifying your drinking. You don't have to justify not drinking. But if it makes you more comfortable say ""my ulcer is acting up today"" or say it interacts with a medication you are taking, whatever. If they push, change the subject. Asking a question about the person's life seems to work especially well. People like to talk about themselves. If they still push, this is likely about them and their relationship with alcohol, and they are very likely drunk. Don't take it personally. The broken record technique is particularly useful in this situation. Repeat the same simple phrase (i.e. ""I don't feel like drinking tonight"") over and over and over. Drunk people get bored easily. If you're not stuck sitting next to them at the dinner table, walking away is also effective.

•The Great Escape. If you must go and do everything above and still feel weak..... Run away! Retreat without apology. Deal with social repercussions later. They will probably be less dramatic than if you get yourself all sloppy drunk and do something stupid.
-Reward yourself for a job well-done. Plan a special little something for when you get home or the next day. A bubble bath, a pedicure, massage, favorite movie, steak dinner etc. You've done something huge! You stayed sober through a major challenge! You deserve it.

•Follow-Up with Self-Care. Just like after a strenuous workout, your sober muscles are bound to be a little tired for the next few days. Check in with your feelings, take it easy, and be vigilant of temptation for a little while.",9

I definitely have a problematic relationship with alcohol (runs in the family, both sides, wheee!) but I'm not convinced that cutting it out completely is necessary for me. 

I drink literally every day, but usually only one or two units — a glass of wine with dinner, a beer in front of the TV. I'll drink enough to get a stonking hangover maybe twice or three times a month. I don't feel like it's compulsive, but I definitely get twitchy if I find out that I don't have anything to drink on a Sunday. I know that's not healthy. 

I also know that quitting isn't a matter of survival for me — I could probably coast along like this without ruined friendships or lost job opportunities for the rest of my life, just a little fatter and, I'm guessing, a little less psychologically robust.

For other people who haven't had to face the terrible ""you can quit or you can fucking die"" addiction binary: can you give me reasons that I should quit anyway? Have you been able to cut down in a meaningful way, and how have you worked out that balance?",9

2019-10-22 06:11:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dlftec/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Happy Tuesday Sobernauts! What media is helping you get or stay sober this week? Or are you just enjoying or finding thought provoking?

I haven’t had much time for reading or shows lately as work is busy and I’m staying busy with getting my Group Power instructor cert and of course bringing a new puppy into the household. I did start watching *The Marvelous Mrs Maisel* Saturday night, though, and had some thoughts about it. Spoilers ahead possibly for those who haven’t seen it but plan to. 

I am enjoying the show and plan to continue watching it. However, the way it portrays alcohol use is exactly the way that really irritates me personally because it is shown as no big deal really but as a great quick solution to a rough day and an easy way to bond with someone, and all with absolutely zero consequences. This type of portrayal of alcohol seems to me to have become popular about 10 years ago and it did effect me, I think. I found it very comforting and encouraging when I was slipping further and further into alcoholism to see people in the media-- smart, funny, attractive people!-- casually slugging down drinks to cope with whatever difficulty life offers just like I do. Because of this, seeing it portrayed this way makes me uncomfortable and a little sad for people who are still struggling with active alcoholism because I know it reinforces that it’s a normal and even sophisticated or glamorous way of coping with problems or celebrating little victories or bonding with an old or new friend. 

The protagonist, Midge, gets drunk-- apparently blackout drunk even-- and performs her first standup show, which offends some people with it's edgy content but which most of the audience loves. There's the myth that alcohol magically brings out the repressed bold and charming inner wit! She exposes her breasts to the audience and gets arrested for indecency . . .  but gets bailed out of jail immediately because of course someone would step right up to bail out such a gorgeous and charming person. After being bailed out, she seemingly continues into her day without missing a beat. Sobers right up. Changes into the next perfectly accessorized outfit. 

She's drinking the next night and the next and the next it seems, but remains a perfect size 2 with creamy, glowing skin and big bright clear eyes. She’s so elegant with her pretty little cocktails and seems so charmingly neurotic swigging wine right out of the bottle. And when she’s drunk she’s such an adorable mess! UGH! 

This show would have been triggering as anything for me in my first year of sobriety and you can see it got me riled even now. That said I am planning to keep watching. It has lots of redeeming qualities. Anyone else watch this one? Thoughts?",13

As soon as I leave work, I stop at the liquor store, grab anywhere from half a pint to a pint of vodka, and finish most of it in a short span of time before my wife comes home from her day at work so I can try to hide the bottle and lie about how much I have drank to her. 

On the weekends, I usually lie about have an errand I have to run on Saturday and go to the liquor store before lunch even comes around. I pick up a few shots, chug them down behind my apartment dumpster, throw out the evidence, and walk inside. Then, I will wait until an appropriate time to drink, and continue to binge until I pass out. When Sunday rolls around, I usually feel terrible, so I turn to alcohol to make myself feel better. It’s a temporary solution that only masks the issue until Monday morning when I have to go go to work. 

Most Monday’s, I just coast through the day. Feeling horrible, being unproductive for the most part and being in a head fog until I get off and drive past the dreaded liquor store. There are so many times I get into my car and say that I will not walk in, but before I know it, I’m walking through the doors and greeting the guy that knows exactly what I am there for and probably thinks I’m a dead-beat. 

Yesterday, I was in a fog all day. Shaky, nauseous, and just generally feeling the effects abusing myself for 3 days straight. That brings me to where I am now.

It’s 2 AM, I can’t sleep. I don’t feel necessarily horrible, but the thought of the damage I have done to my body over the past 2-3 years is keeping me awake. It’s very evident that I need to stop drinking before it ruins my career, my relationship with my wife, and my health. I know a thousand thoughts will fly through my head later today as soon as I drive past the liquor store, but I am going to try my hardest to not drink with any of you today. 

I guess any tips or advice anyone has would help. Drinking has been a huge part of my social life/family gatherings, so this isn’t familiar territory for me. 

Thanks in advance.",6

Anyone who hikes or explores through the forest can understand how hard it is to blaze a new trail....especially to make it a permanent, pretty and well worn pathway, with no sticker bushes! 
I loved something I heard that said our minds are the same way. 
We have to be consciously aware of the new, good, pathways we want to take and take them and take them until they become permanent and eventually automatic. 

Its the same way we learned to take our negative, ugly pathways......over time, till they became automatic. Once we choose, over and over and over again to take the new pathway....the old one will beautifully close up with sticker bushes and we won't ""automatically"" turn to them. IF we were to choose them.....it won't be an easy choice. Taking the new pretty pathway, that'll be the pathway to take. 
They used to say our minds do not grow after we are adults but new studies are finding we can learn new ways to be! (I have proven it to myself as now my new pathways are the automatic choice instead of the old dark and ugly ones I took for 30+ years)",15

I went out to eat with my best friend, and then we went to a patio bar for a drink just to be outdoors on a beautiful day. I ordered a Virgin Moscow Mule, and I was ready to go after ONE. There wasn't any desire to stay there and keep chugging ginger beer. We had been hanging out for almost three hours, the conversation had gotten repetitive, it was getting dark, and traffic was lightening up. It was time to go, and I did. I feel satiated by our social interaction, but not completely taxed like I would have been if I had been drinking alcohol.

After leaving, I was faced with an unexpected, intense social interaction from an old friend. I dealt with it head-on with grace and honesty. If I had been drinking, I would have avoided the conversation or passive-aggressively lashed out. Instead of driving him away, we became closer.

I read a great quote on my sober app that perfectly fits my day:

""Sobriety isn't just about not drinking. It's about living a conscious life- wide awake for every breath. It's about confronting your fears and choosing not to hide. It's about the loss of insincerity and the shedding of veils. Sobriety is knowing your power and never EVER giving it away. It's about living a life with intention- one that makes your soul stir and your spirit hum. Sobriety unearths the glow that's been there all along. It is a well-earned souvenir after the fire that made you."" --Anon

I'm living my life with gratitude, fulfillment, and intention, and it feels fucking fantastic!

My initial goal was to stop drinking and I feel I've been successful however I recently gotten a major job promotion I believe as a result of my sobriety. one night I went out two weeks ago and had a single glass of sangria with my girlfriend. She showed up after having three drinks and driving under the influence proceeded to have two more drinks but then chose to chastise me for having a drink calling me the alcoholic. I ignored her but reminded her that she is using poor judgment by drinking and driving and ask her to leave the bar with me since the cops were patrolling. She refused jumped in her car and drove home angrily. The next morning I called her up and told her that her behavior was very dangerous and unacceptable she told me I should have demanded that she get in the car with me I was concerned about the visual of me dragging a woman into my car and declined. Fast forward this week right prior to dinner she shows up after having two drinks she has two more the fourth drink she asked to put into a paper cup and we drove to the restaurant I stated to her that an open container is an offense. once we reach the restaurant I have a single beer once again she's calling me the alcoholic. I decided I had enough and I explained to her that I've had two drinks in 10 days where you've had 12 to 13 I've lost over 30 lbs and I feel great. I do recognize that I made the initial goal to stop drinking and having two drink some how I feel I've let myself down. however I'm very much offended that she keeps calling me the alcoholic when her behavior her actions to me indicates that she is one she refuses to accept it she refuses to stop drinking for one week because she doesn't want to how do I handle this without getting angry on a regular basis?,1

While I have only been a lurker on this site up to this point, I would visit the sub most evenings to gain inspiration and to reflect on my journey.

In my first three or four months especially, I found it helpful to read posts of success stories. The one year mark is a natural point for me to share some of the successes I have had in the past twelve months. I hope they may help others stay focused and motivated, as other posts have helped me. In the past year, I have been able to accomplish the following, which may have been impossible or very difficult with my regular heavy drinking.

While sober in the past year, I have:

* lost 36 pounds,
* read 59 books,
* took family on Disney vacation,
* made several major home repairs (including new roof),
* paid off back taxes,
* improved overall health,
* started therapy,
* took up baking,
* stabilized a chaotic work environment,
* focused on being more kind and empathetic, and (most importantly)
* been a better (and more present) husband, father, and overall human being.

Overall, sobriety is working well for me, but it is not without its challenges. However, the gains far outweigh the negatives. 

So much of this past year is getting back to a baseline. In general, I feel optimistic about continuing to grow and improve on the gains that sobriety has provided me in the first year.

To those of you just getting started or wavering in your sober journey, I hope you find the outcomes of my sober year to be helpful. All of these successes would not have been realized without the wonderful community here at SD.

I'm looking forward to year two!",46

Whenever I think about drinking (particularly with regard to other people I know who still drink) I strongly view the actual process as completely (and irreparably) broken for me.

So many facets of it are broken: the biological breakdown of the alcohol hurting my organs, the initial tolerance, the intolerance of the aftereffects, the overestimate of fun, the underestimate of the hangover, the disproportionate urges, the inappropriate behaviour and associated guilt, a punishment that is masked as a reward. The list could go on, and I also theorise a bit about the process breaking down for everybody eventually, at different rates (like the elevator going down analogy - it falls for some people immediately, others slowly and barely noticeably).

I cannot go back to drinking, it has changed for me and no longer works. I like my new easier/calmer life and want to keep feeling like this instead. IWNDWYT",31

2019-10-21 20:17:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dl9l4m/commitment_doubt_and_craving/,"Commitment, doubt and craving","So, I've finally quit my intake of alcohol (and a hefty cocktail of other intoxicants) about 53 days ago. Needless to say, it's been quite the ride. Withdrawals were quite horrid but they pale in comparison to the constant, obnoxious nagging that cravings bring to the table. With the former, I knew that, at some point, they would end. I've had them before (while not as severe, but still), but I had never actually abstained for this long. 

I often catch myself 'fantasising' about resuming my 'habit' at some point. Of course, these fantasies revolve around some utopian world where I would be able to moderate, or at least regulate my drinking and drug consumption. It's constantly on my mind, alongside the regular cravings. 

I feel that these fantasies are, in part, so compelling because I've recently set a more-or-less concrete 'goal' for myself with my current therapist. At first, I had some vague, floating idea that I would remain stone-cold sober for at least three months, and then some more to be able to partake in meaningful therapy. The current goal is 150 days, which seemed very daunting, like *forever*. 

But that's the funny bit: I'm not convinced it *will* be forever. It may seem like such, but a big part of me is actively dreaming and sometimes even *planning* (in a very broad and daydreamy manner) about what I'll do (and not do) after those 150 days. Hell, a big part of me is very upset and disillusioned with me that I even committed to that goal. My determination to reach it is more-or-less guided and ruled by external factors. People who've told me to stop, or at least cut down, and who now tell me they're ''proud'' and whatnot. But I miss it. I don't want to go back to the craziness of the summer months — even I had to admit that was ludicrous. But to throw it away completely? Forever? 

I love alcohol, and I love drugs. Is it a toxic relationship? Very often, yes. It's a crutch very prone to make you fall flat on your face. But I don't like to imagine I've ripped up my 'party' badge, just shy of 21 years old. If, after I've reached my 'goal', I decide to drink again, or pop a pill, or whatever... You just can't go back to the merry, carefree days, because people will know, and people will judge. Addict wasn't my label, and neither is clean. I'm more than that, surely? I get uncomfortable when people tell me how proud they are, or yadda yadda.

I realise I'm rambling (a lot). I don't think I would've quit if it weren't for my former therapist giving me the choice between sobering up or ending treatment. Now, there's little for me to keep going, let alone past my 150-day goal, but the fact that I'm already about two-thirds in. 

I'm not quite sure if I'll be able to remain sober past my 'goal', or if I even want to. At the very least, I don't want to return to what I was, or did. 

It's nice to fantasise about the 'good ol' days, but it's haunting all the same.

2019-10-21 20:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dl9hi2/been_wanting_too_lately/,Been wanting too lately,"Backstory - started drinking when I was just shy of 14 (typical high school beer drinking), and ramped it up a lot in college, switching to liquor mostly. Graduated and lived on my own for a few years before meeting my wife, and before I met her I was drinking grain alcohol (more on that later), and it freaked her out when I met her, so I went back to vodka.

I have anxiety about a lot of things, and my family has some people with substance abuse issues (some with drugs, others with drinking), so I often created rules for myself when drinking. I am kind of introverted, so I mostly just drank at home on a weekend (never wanted it to interfere with work). I was so scared of getting a DUI like some of my family members that I'd hide my keys (or just put them in a real inconvenient position for a drunk person to get to), or I'd just make sure I had ""everything I'd need for the night"" at my place, so there's no urge to leave the house.

I've always hated the taste of alcohol, I was just in it to get drunk. I rarely would be like ""I had a bad day, time to get drunk"", but it was more or less a planned night of recreation if I didn't have an obligations to take care of. Regardless, with my ultimate goal of getting drunk, I slowly went from beer to liquor, to grain alcohol where I'd just swig from the bottle at my sink before going back to watching movies or playing games. Met wife, she didn't like me drinking that strong of stuff, so I moved down to vodka. For the most part, she was fine with it and is fine with me if I ever decide to drink again (she reiterates that she never made me quit, which I never feel she did). She'd get concerned some nights when I'd black out on the couch that one night she'd find me and I wouldn't wake up, or that some of my family's health history would catch up to me, etc. So nothing really bad or messed up ever occurred from my drinking, if that makes any difference?

Got drunk one Christmas Eve, night was fine, then with travel, visiting family, I hadn't drank for a few weeks. Then we had friends move to town and we helped babysit their newborn while they got settled, and drinking was an absolute non-option when that went down, I wouldn't even consider it. We'd babysit anywhere between 2 and 5 days a week, and that went on for nearly a year, so before you know it, I hadn't drank in nearly a year and I barely noticed it, to be honest. So I figured ""it's been a year, might as well keep going"" and that pretty much got me by until recently.

Life's just been hell recently, really busy, really stressful, lots of downers going on. Last few weeks I've found myself wanting to just get hammered one weekend, but I talk myself out of it fairly quickly. My wife said I'm free to if I want, but there's just this... force inside me pushing back (just thinking about it makes me tense throughout my entire body) saying no. I even break it down step by step in my head what actions I even need to do to drink (like to the level of ""grab bottle with hand"" and ""take cap off"") and I can rationalize in a sense where I say ""well I can't get drunk if I don't even pick up the bottle"".

I'm just really confused, and every time I go back and forth in my head, I keep asking myself if I'm an alcoholic. I've never wanted to go down that path, because I don't know if I'd just be a ""poser"" or something and offend people who've really been to hell and back. Sorry if I'm out of line, or even in the wrong place, just not really sure where to empty my head of everything regarding this and figured it's worth a try here.",3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Sometimes, times like these, I have this notion that it’s a good time for a controlled sadness. Just wallow and sulk, eat like shit, stay in the dark, and just lay around and mope about to get it all out of my system and get back to living. The strange victory here is that this time, it didn’t even occur to me to drink during this period. Normally such phases would be the prime excuse to just day drink and be passed out by early afternoon day after day, but I realized a few schlubby days into my lowly lows that it hadn’t even crossed my mind to do so.

I was worried about being awkward or bored, and was pleasantly surprised! I have fun both nights and laughed and told and listened to jokes and stories, as I usually would, but was probably a bit less loud than I would normally be. My SO got a free glass of champagne at the fondue place for her birthday, and as a result opted not to drink her last very full glass of white wine. It’s weird how much my alcoholic brain was focused on that full glass. I even caught myself thinking I could just have one small glass- even though I truly didn’t want to! Luckily I wasn’t truly tempted and was able to ignore that dumb alcoholic brain. 

I will say I get bored a little faster and am more impatient with people who’ve been drinking- stories get more boring and I’m not fuelled by alcohol and the desire to get wasted so I’m ready to go home sooner. I’m only on day four though so I don’t know what I’ll be like long term, these are just observations from two nights of social zing. 

I think the real revelation was that I’m not actually socially awkward when I’m hanging with my friends, and that I CAN ignore that crappy alcoholic lizard brain. Also there’s nothing wrong with ending ones night a little early and getting a good nights’ sleep!",4

But also because I am lonely and need to make new friends who aren't alcoholics and just don't know where to begin... Worst part is I am social and work in a social profession, so this shouldn't be difficult. Anyone have any tips?

Saturday night I just couldn't sleep more than 5 hours and Sunday I felt like crap. It was random and there is no reason why I shouldn't have been able to sleep. The lack of sleep + etc. made me feel like crap, kind of like I was hungover.

Today was going fine until I had the smallest issue that just gave me a ton of anxiety. I totally blew the issue out of proportion and was freaking out for no reason. I tend to be more on the anxious side but this was a whole new level. I spoke with a roommate about the issue and they were nice and pretty much told me to calm down. 

So now I am over the self-induced anxiety but am upset that I didn't react normally to the small issue noted above and essentially had a panic attack over nothing. Normally when feeling this way, I would just drink. 

And I guess that gets to the main problem I am facing with early sobriety. Normally, I am not an emotional roller-coaster like I have been the last two days, but the emotions kinda do suck. That said, the loneliness from not hanging out with my drinking friends has been the absolute most difficult part of this whole experience. Trying to make new friends at 30 is not a fun thing and thinking about it just makes me sad. :/

And I say all of this and sit here upset despite sobriety being the best thing in the world for me and a TON of positive changes having occurred over the last 93 days... Like extremely increased mental health/reduced anxiety, lost 40 lbs, increased my salary by 50%, etc etc. Today still sucked.

I guess that recovering from alcoholism sure ain't easy, but it is easier than continuing to drink...",8

I wanted to check in with everyone here about this weekend. We had a family member going away for a few years to study so the family threw a party. It was haaaaard! There were bottles of red wine, Jameson and copious amounts of beer, literally EVERYWHERE. Temptation kicked in for sure, but I just had to stay focused on what my path was and stayed strong. I am so grateful I didn’t drink at the party, I only had some hot tea and kombucha. The loose tea doesn’t seem like a big deal, but my aunt (who knows I can’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol) made sure to bring some to the party from her house because she knew it was my favorite before I started drinking. I even recapped an open bottle of Jameson sitting next to me because the smell made me gag and that made me feel strong because I didn’t take a swig from it. My fiancé and I are also on better terms now, he would come by, check in with me and how I was doing throughout the night. My best friend was also there, she had drank a little too much and ended up having a really bad headache & upset stomach. I helped her to the bathroom a few times, gave her some water and bundled her up in a blanket before I left. At the end of the night I told my fiancé that the party had many temptations and my triggers were everywhere, he turned to me and said, “see how much stronger you were than it today? let’s keep going, day by day.” I’m only 10 days in, but I can already see my life changing for the better. I know my addiction is doing some CrossFit right now and thinks it’ll get me next time, but IWNDWYT or ever again.

I also missed a day because I was so hungover and my grade went down by 7% (I’m in an accelerated program for a two year degree so missing one day can be detrimental). I’m really wanting to get straight A’s but I obviously will never have that if I choose to drink.

He explains that alcohol and our addiction to it is what creates the anxiety that makes us want to drink in the first place. Enjoy:

""Imagine you had a small spot on your face. I say, “Try this ointment, it’s really marvelous!” You do so, and the spot disappears like magic, but returns a week later, slightly larger. You apply more ointment and “Hey Presto!” the spot disappears again; only to return in five days time. The process continues, and each time the spot returns it is larger, itchier, and more painful. The periods during which the spot disappears gets shorter and shorter. It soon becomes a rash covering your whole face. Imagine the terror of your situation. Unless you can find a cure, the rash is going to spread over your whole body; and eventually, the interval between using the ointment and the rash returning will disappear completely. Imagine how dependent you would be on that ointment. I’m now charging you a hundred pounds a tube and you have no choice but to pay it. Just the thought of running low on the ointment creates panic. You won’t leave the house without it.

You then read an article in a newspaper and discover that this problem isn’t unique to you. Thousands of other people have been afflicted by the same rash! But scientists have discovered that the ointment does not cure the sore; in fact it is the ointment itself which prevents the cure. Indeed it is only the ointment that has caused the original spot to progress into the killer rash. Had you not used the ointment, the original spot would have disappeared in due course. The effect of the ointment was to make the spot disappear beneath the skin. Far from being cured by the ointment, the spot actually fed on it, then returned to the surface of the skin for further sustenance.

The article contains even better news. All you need do to solve the problem is to stop using the ointment, and the rash will gradually disappear in its own good time! Would you use the ointment again? Would it take willpower not to use it? Would you be miserable? Of course not, provided you knew for certain that this would solve the problem, you would be over the moon. However, if you had doubts you might be tempted to use the ointment again, and you would have to use willpower to resist the temptation. In such circumstances you would expect to be miserable and frightened. But even in those circumstances, once you realized for the first time that the rash was indeed getting smaller and less painful, you would know then that you had the answer: and even if it took a year for the rash to disappear completely, you would be happy from the start.""",176

I thought I’d share my experience, as I’ve had my share of “Mount-up Monday’s.” 


If you fall, get right back on the horse.

I taught horseback riding lessons for many years, and the old saying when a rider falls, “get right back on your horse” has more meaning than you may know...

The longer you wait to get back on after the fall, the more time fear has to process and take hold and associate horses with fear, pain, and danger. Just another way your brain subconsciously programs you to survive... 

If the rider and horse are physically ok, you get the rider mounted back on their horse immediately, even if the coach has to lead the horse at a walk as the rider just sits there.

As an accomplished rider, I thought I was past this psychological trick, fear after a fall would NEVER hinder my riding, been there done that — but after the worst fall I’ve experienced, I couldn’t get right back on because of an injury. (Horse was fine.) 

After recovering a few weeks, I took my first ride back on an old reliable “babysitter” horse. As I swung my leg over to get on, my adrenaline started pumping, heart racing, muscles tensed — what the heck was this about?! I could hardly override my fear instincts with rational thoughts ‘you’ve done this a billion times. The horse is safe. I’m a professional’... It was such an involuntary reaction that I felt surreal. But after a ride or two, I was back to normal, but oh boy that SHIT WAS REAL!

Why do I say this?

Don’t wait to get back on your “sober horse.”

I’ve fallen off the “sober horse” more times than four-legged ones, and each time — the longer I waited to get back on, the more fear and dread came with it, making it even harder to start again.  

Mount-up and move out!

Yesterday was my 2 weeks sober date! I'm pretty proud of myself! I returned to work last Monday and people have been complimenting me on my eyes, on my skin. So yeah, people notices. That's pretty crazy!

I wanted to show you some stats from my FitBit, I find them pretty incredible :

https://imgur.com/a/F18D9vR

It is pretty amazing that my resting BPM has been improving as soon as I stopped drinking on the 6th.

Other than that, I'm feeling pretty good, not amazing tho. My sleep has improved, I feel more rested. Still didn't find an alternative to alcohol tho. Still looking! I'm stoked that I won't have any alcohol related purchases to refund on my credit card when the pay comes up on Thursday.

Also I did simple maths this weekend : I was drinking almost 2700 calories worth of alcohol per day (40 ounces of whisky). That's more than a days worth of calories, just in alcohol...

My friend who is supporting me asked me if I was happy. I'm not. Still got some shakes (but I suppose I could attribute them to coffee and/or the fact that I'm not sipping 2700 calories of sugar per day anymore). I may not have alcohol anxiety anymore, but I think I was self-medicating to hide an anxiety problem. I have a rendezvous at a rehab center on Thursday to see what they could do to help me.

That's it for now. As always thanks for your support.

The summer of grade 8 was the first time I got drunk with my friends and family. I got Black out hammered and probably pissed on the floor. From then on out i smoked pot and drank threw high school. The booze didn't seem to affect me, I would make it to work saturday morning hangover, puke in the staff bathroom if required and carry on. I had multiple fake ID's and would go to the bar most of my grade 12 year, getting super hammered and dancing the night away. By the time i was done with high school and onto college i a proper stoner and liked to get drunk. I dropped out of my first college probably bc i was high all the time. So i decided to go out West to BC and work at ski resort. This was the beginning of the end. I got so drunk on new years that i got in fire extinguisher fight and was kicked off the resort, that i was living at. I came home and started using MDMA for a couple months. Deciding i had a problem, i went cold turkey on everything and returned to college, this time i did very well but had carried on drinking. This was my first time at AA a college friend too me with him and i was like, i am not as bad as these people but i should slow down. I applied to the army and sadly broke my wrist skateboarding one night because i was drunk. After college I took a job and went to work, binge drinking on weekends and 2-3 day hangovers. this cost me my job and I returned to my parents house. so by now I've tried to stop drinking a few times maybe 3-4, normally it would take for a month or so. I took a new job in construction and started to drink again after work and on weekends with my friends. Again i try and stop, using the gym and my art to motivate me. Again i fail ps i also smoke cigarettes. so I'm roughly 25 by now and have tried to quit maybe 8-10 times. i've started to practice yoga and that is helping me for sure. the next couple years I work hard at sobriety getting 6-8 months steaks, but when i fall off its bad. Costing jobs and friends. So by now i have a great history of lessons and skills to stay sober and now my triggers and the effects. I love being sober but its hard. I have decided to study yoga in India and have my flight book and am getting ready to go. My nerves start up as the trip gets near and I start to have the odd drink and smoking pot, not a big deal IMO as this time its barely affecting me and i think i'm finally controlling the demons within. OHH how wrong i was, i start my trip my first flight was easy but then i have a 8 hour layover. I make the choice to have a beer instead of a coffee and one turns into 8. they wont let me fly and i send myself back home. I'm 28 and have watched my drinking destroy all my hard work, normally in 1 night. Lost a few other jobs due to getting drunk the night before a shift and not going in.  Anyways I'm at 2 and a half weeks currently and going strong, i found this Sub and its been amazing to just read everyone's stories and know Im not alone.  Thank you for the community.

I'd say daily for the most part and most recently I've been hitting it pretty hard - basically from having a couple beers on a good night to getting trashed once every few weeks and everything in between.

Even though my drinking is so regular - here is the thing.  I run 35-55 miles a week and I've been training religiously for a race that is coming up.  Its crazy- I've been logging the miles, hitting my goals and then almost immediately after these runs I start drinking.

Here is my question:  If I try to stop drinking before my race that is in a week will withdrawals screw up my race?  I'm afraid that if I stop cold turkey right now my body will go into shock and it has learned to function really well (the human body is amazing that it can take this abuse and still perform).

I can't wait til this race is over so I can work on my problem.  I've hit the end of my rope.  Yesterday I started drinking after my run - got hammered with a buddy.  Took a nap and then woke up met some friends at the bar for a few more.   This cannot continue.  The day after I feel like crap, am less productive and sneak naps during the work day.  Only to repeat it a day or two later.  

Thanks for any insights about what I can expect to feel like.

I have 2 hours until my flight and have developed a strong urge to go over there and get myself a delicious mimosa or IPA.

Please remind me why I don't need to go over there and get that drink.

It hasn’t all been easy. Telling friends and family I’m no longer the party animal has resulted in all kinds of reactions and sometimes awkward situations. I have had a few knee jerk cravings (especially all the beers when in Europe!) but approached it with curiosity, sampling new juices, kombuchas, mocktails, and NA beers. I thought living AF would means I’d immediately lose all extra weight and gain energy etc. I’m on my way but still have more work to do.

My goals for the next two months: being more mindful about what I eat and starting and keeping  a new, consistent workout routine. I’m also going to start a new hobby by learning to draw and paint.

I am an aviation geek.  I have loved airplanes, airlines, and all things commercial aviation since long before my first drink.

I have spent way to many hours online reading about which airlines have which planes, who flies where, and even the drama between unions and management.  I’m a dork, but I love it.

Alcohol robbed me from experiencing so many things that are of interest to me.  I love plane spotting at an airport, and used to arrive way to early just to plane spot.

Alcohol robbed me of enjoying life.  One area that perfectly demonstrates this is how it changed my behavior in airports.

I used to arrive early to plane spot.  I used to plan my travel by what interesting stop overs I could find.  

Then booze happened.

Airports became just an excuse to drink.  A socially acceptable place to be hammered-regardless of time of day.

I’m now almost 15 months sober.  And I am finally now (for the most part) comfortable at the airport. 

My husband scored an amazing deal on a first class between New York and Hong Kong.  It is essential 95% off.  The airline made a pricing mistake, but decided to honor it.

Last night I stayed at the TWA hotel at JFK.  I got spend the evening plane spotting from their rooftop lounge.  You saw Kenya Airline’s 787, spotted JetBlue’s A220 (didn’t even know they had them!), and spotted several old favorites.  It was a blast!  I haven’t stopped smiling since yesterday and won’t for another day.

I am so glad to be doing things I enjoy, to be living life, and not be controlled by the bottle anymore.

Well I started exercising and dieting I stayed at my grandparents house the entire time this was happening. I guess my mother didn't want me back home  (I'm 24 year old disabled for PTSD and other anxiety disorders) just yet until things cooled down understandably so I came back finally and after walking 4 miles a day for a week doing 100 pushups a day and landscaping my grandfather's absolutely huge yard and he pays me well I get  $40-55 for 1.5-4 hours of work every weekend with the leafs in new england that need to be picked up.

I ended up losing 20 pounds and started brushing my teeth twice a day with flossing and bought a tongue scraper.

this isn’t my first go-round on the sober train. it’s happened twice before. the mental anguish i experienced both times will not be soon forgotten. i spent 6 months each time just waiting for the opportunity to arise to have another drink.  eventually it started out slowly and bloomed into two bottles of wine a night...again. 

i have liver problems. at 40 years old my health is not good and it’s the booze to blame. i exercise. but i’m still obese with the amount of calories i drink. 

my wife drinks too, but not nearly as much as i do. a couple big glasses a night and she’s off to bed. that’s usually about the time the second bottle comes out for me. 

i have a beautiful young daughter who needs me. she’s amazing, brilliant and deserves a good father. 

i’m highly functioning, have a successful business and never get behind the wheel if i’ve had a drink. from the outside it all seems fine. 

i tried aa several years ago and we didn’t get along, at all. just not for me. 

i had a rough childhood. several different flavors of abuse.  i was hurt badly, mentally and physically.  i have no self esteem. no self-love. i don’t believe i can be loved. my relationships are generally with people who confirm that fact for me. 

i’ve had lots of shrinks. nice people who meant well, but no words that ever changed anything. 

last night i told myself that today was going to be day one...again. three hours into my day and i want a drink with lunch.

unfortunately alcohol is the only thing i’ve ever found that makes it ok for me. it‘s awful stuff, don’t get me wrong, but it works on my brain.

Here's some things I have learned,"It’s strange to think it’s almost been a year since I last drank. I wasn’t a daily drinker, or at least I told myself, I was a binge drinker that would be too hungover to drink the next day (or function for that matter) but I would drink the next day, no doubt about that. I would drink hard more times then not, it was pretty easy for me to clean off a six pack of strong IPAs then work on an even stronger 4 pack of the same. Sometimes if I ran out of beer I would drink vodka straight from the freezer. Weird. If I smell a beer now (or any alcohol for that matter) I usually gag. I would be slow, cranky, agitated, but mostly anxious. I’m so glad I’ve changed my ways. It wasn’t easy but it was all worth it. 

Here’s a list of things that I learned that I hope someone finds helpful:

-There will be a first of everything: First sober holidays, birthday, party, wedding, funeral. Even small things like yardwork and football games. They will all turn out better than you thought if you just stay the path. 

-You have to start forgiving yourself. Shit happens, you fucked up, you will be better. You can be better.

-Sleep is awesome. 

-Temptations will happen, sometimes out of nowhere, odd things will trigger them (Summer for me!). They don’t last. Ride the wave. 

-Find a hobby that will keep you active. Mind, body, soul.

I’ve only blacked out twice, and I think lack of sleep had more of an influence on one occasion. I went through college and grad school drinking a fair amount, but there were never many negative consequences  - very rare hangovers, no withdrawals. Occasionally I’d say something stupid or offensive, but I’ve never gotten into fights or lost friends because of it. I’ve thrown up from drinking, but I have a weak stomach so that isn’t unusual (I get very severe motion sickness and throw up a lot after plane flights, and I never drink when traveling).

I saw a YouTube video of Joe Rogan and Nikki Glaser talking about her sobriety and how she read Allen Carr’s “how to stop drinking” book, read it myself in a day, and decided I didn’t want to drink again. It has only been a week, and I have only told a few people. All of them have reacted by saying “...but you don’t have an alcohol problem.” While I appreciate the compliment (?), I’ve explained that I feel much better not drinking because my sleep has improved drastically (I’ve had issues with sleeping my whole life and take meds and am followed by a neurologist, who is fine with me having a drink or two on the weekends). Everyone has been much more comfortable with my decision when they find out that my sleep has improved, which is a nice side effect, but nothing to do with why I stopped. I just don’t want to put poison in my body. 

Just wanted to put it out there that you don’t have to reach a low point in order to change. Stopping drinking is good for everyone, not just those who experience negative consequences. It’s healthy, and this subreddit has been inspiring so far (:",16

I was only working about 5hrs a week this last few months and no hours at all for 8 weeks before I stopped drinking. If it wasn't for unemployment I would have been on the streets because of my drinking.

I eventually got myself together enough to go on a job interview and get hired full time. Working again and having responsibilities has been great for my self esteem and I'm sure a big reason why I have stayed sober this long. 

I had opportunities to drink this last run but did not give in. What I am worried about is when I have my 2 days off work a week I still revert back to my old habits that caused me to drink. I still want to lay in bed, drink soda all day, eat junk food and overall am just depressed and miserable.

I spend the first 3hrs of my day passively going over the previous night in my head, my text messages, anything that I may have said or did that could require damage control. Thankfully I am usually in the clear.

Now the weekly trap. I look at my calendar and promise myself that I can make it through the week without drinking because I am so busy right? Wouldn't I be better off if I didn't drink this week? I've done it before! So I go about my business until something quite good or bad happens and I decide to drink, or I am out and decide to drink, or I am home alone and bored and numb myself with drink. This happens on the first day of the week and crushes the rest of my plan.

Then, the monthly trap. Happens at the end of each month, and works the same as the weekly trap. I look at the month ahead and think ""THIS COULD BE MY MONTH!"", wouldn't I love to stop drinking? Revert to weekly trap to see what happens next.

My drinking has gone from disastrous and dangerous to insidious and creeping upwards again. I’m no longer driving blackout drunk, I’m no longer suicidal when drinking, I’m not engaging in reckless behaviours, which is all good, but I’m still drinking. And in similar quantities. I just think my mental health may be a bit better so I’m not going off the deep end like I used to. Which is also good. 

But, I still need to stop. I’m harming my body and mind just as much. My tolerance is going up again, I killed a six pack plus last night and I’m not even feeling it much today. Just a little extra anxiety but that could also just be me. I’m binge eating with my drinking (killed an entire pizza last night, ugh) and then starving myself all day just to repeat the cycle again. 

I have a major and important surgery coming up in less than six weeks. It’s not a lot of time but I need to get healthier. Not even that seems to be driving me enough. I’m so frustrated with myself. And so I drink at myself, which is ridiculous. I know that. Maybe it’s time to actually admit I have a problem. Ie I’m addicted to alcohol. 

I feel pretty shitty about myself this morning. And I slept like shit last night. And I sure as shit don’t want to go to work at my second job which is one of my few days off from my other job. Maybe I need to quit and give myself more time to just be. But sometimes more time gets me in trouble. Catch 22.

And I am so grateful that now I can appreciate those same feelings. I can find the lessons in them. I can admit, with sincerity, when I am wrong in a situation. THAT is what peace is for me. Knowing that I am ok in any situation life throws at me and that I don’t have to drink it “away”.

The dangers are many fold - Halloween is a holiday built for drinking especially if you can wear a mask and no one will know the things you did.  

Thanksgiving and Christmas include the tidal surge of FAMILY.  This can be more dangerous than the winds of stupidity - and it is good to remember that **Family pushes your buttons so well - because they installed them**  In addition, Christmas includes the holiday party at work which everyone feels obligated to go to.  If only because free booze.  

So much more could be written about dysfunctional families, enforced gaiety, and the fact that seasonal affect disorder is in high swing (in the northern hemisphere) - but I'll let you include them in comments below if you feel the need.

And then, just when you think the skies are clearing - New Years!  It's been a shitty year, what better way to end it than by getting stupid, and, if lucky, arrested for a felony?  A New Years resolution made in a holding cell is especially strong.  Nothing like a regret that has a probation officer attached.

Thing is there is help in this season of blowing booze.  In AA there are often 'alcathons' which are essentially back to back meetings a place where you can go to avoid Uncle Hal and Aunt Trudy for an hour or twenty four.  Often there is a pot luck element - or the chance of being invited to a sober dinner somewhere.  For those not in AA these events are used to having strangers - nobody is going to ask why you are there - Use a fake name, say you are visiting from another planet - drink a cup of coffee and breathe.  

Smart or Refuge Recovery may have similar events - contact them.

Come here to Stopdrinking - start a thread about drunken relatives - or cringeworthy rememberances your sister keeps bringing up...   There is a chat in the side bar...  

The bottom line is **you don't have to drink.**  And a lot of us don't - and after the first one it gets easier...

And then next year you'll be able to write a post about how YOU got through the holidays without drinking.",916

Those two days were a disappointment, I'm not proud of them, but from another perspective I cam be. I still consider myself 8 weeks into success, it makes me feel stronger and more hopeful in myself that I was able to bounce back so quickly rather than to fall off the wagon for another 2 months.

2019-10-21 00:47:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dkveh6/anxiety_about_work_tomorrow/,Anxiety about work tomorrow,"
I was thinking at one point today about the anxieties some people feel that a lot of others would consider unnecessary. People worry about shit that just doesn’t matter, ya know? Maybe it’s a scratch on the car, or they and a coworker had a falling out and they need to face them the next day. Tiny things, that get resolved, or don’t, and either way, it doesn’t affect much. 

I think some people feel this way because they’ve never felt true pain or had real serious problems. Sure, most people have had a share of bad occurrences, but nothing life and death. You see... it takes feeling real, hard, ugly fucking pain to understand what real problems are. Pain gives perspective. I thought that this morning but didn’t even think about how it applies to my current situation. 

I walked around anxious and on edge all day about having to go to work the next day. As I turned my head to my pillow tonight in an attempt to sleep, my thoughts turned to my alcoholic days. I thought in detail about the nights of internalized anxiety. I thought about the process of it. 

I got to thinking, on a night like this one, having anxiety about the coming day, how I’d be handling it, drunk. It’s almost certain that on this hypothetical day that is based on actual history, I would have passed out in a chair around 7:30 or 8. Then I’d wake up around 11, with the tv still on, but the house would be silent. I’d get my bearings. Then I would need to turn my attention to the pain. My stomach feeling like it was being crushed, and the urge to vomit always present. My shaking hands and cloudy mind would be noticeable. I’d think about my inventory. Most likely, I only had two or three shots of vodka hidden somewhere, because I bought a small bottle I could sneak in the house in the waist of my jeans. Possibly, I had a few cans of beer in the car, and those would have to do for the morning. It would suck, drinking piss warm beer in the morning, but I’d have too to function. So I’d ration my vodka over the next couple hours that I was wide awake because my heart was racing. It would most likely be enough to get me until about 5 am with a few hours of sleep. Then I’d have to start the process of keeping my BAC up again. All the while brushing my teeth, showering, shaving and getting ready for work. Instead of my real situation today, where my job may have a little drama tomorrow, but nothing I can’t handle, my fears would be founded. At any moment I could be called out for smelling of booze. Or worse, randomly tested. It hung over me every day. All morning I’d have to fight the urge to barf while I waited for 11 am so I could get my shaky ass to a liquor store on a Monday. Then, if all that succeeded, I’d be so tired in the afternoon I could hardly keep my eyes open. What a lovely existence. Then, the end of the workday would come, and I would repeat the whole fucking thing. Not even because I wanted too anymore. Because I had too. 

So fuck this shit. Whatever comes tomorrow, comes. I’m so prepared and ready. I’ve felt real pain. I’ve been in real hell. I know of good fuckin reasons to be anxious. Now that I’m sober, I am more than ready to handle it. This ain’t shit. 🙂",26

I don't miss house parties at all: they were practically a guaranteed blackout, and then I'd say or do some stupid shit that I'd obsess over all week.  I don't miss going out to bars or clubs; either I'd get drunk and go home with somebody, at which point I'd feel bad about myself, or I'd get drunk and not go home with somebody, in which case I'd feel bad about myself. 

I'm to the point where I don't even miss drinking alone, which was my favorite way to drink: just me and a rocks glass of bourbon, slowly floating up away from the world, only to come crashing back to earth the next morning, anxious and dizzy and dry-mouthed, scrambling to look presentable for work. 

But fuck, I miss drinking one-on-one with a really close friend.  The intimacy!  The feeling that they're an open book to you, just like you're an open book to them.  The feeling that, hey, we're drinking roughly the same excessive amount, so is it really all that excessive, in the end?  The silly luxury of talking in circles for hours, or doing dumb shit like playing Taps on the piano when the bottle is finally killed.  The overwhelming sense of security: not only is this liquor making you feel funny and witty and deep, but the person across from you thinks the same thing, so it must be true! 

I'm so fucking grateful for the three months that I've gone without a drink.  I feel much better physically and psychologically.  I'm not a bad-tempered ball of anxiety and hangover-sweat anymore.  Not drinking is the right thing for me to do, and I know that, but it's not exactly easy.

I am so proud of myself - and I am so grateful.  I used to black out all the time - embarrass myself - feel sick - eat terribly - be fat. I was always scared of what damage I was doing to my then 5 year old daughter.  My father was an alcoholic and I was so ashamed that I was going to do to my daughter what he did to me. 

By the grace of God - I finally had enough. It was do or die - like - if I don't succeed this time - then I am destined for a miserable life.  I found this sub and I read and read and read.  I cried - I related.  I finally admitted freely - I am an alcoholic.  I went to an outpatient bootcamp - SMART meetings - and this sub - and it worked. 

&#x200B;

Life has improved in every which way. My family is stronger than I ever thought possible.  MY career is thriving - relationships amazing.  Workout everyday - for the first time in my life i have a fit body - I sleep great - my skin is clear - I am so healthy emotionally and physically. 

My daughter is proud I am her mother and that is by far the best and most powerful reward.  

I feel like a superwoman - and it feels good.  Thank you to all of you!  IWNDWYT!",133

I look at my life, and there's so much potential. I try to remind myself I'm not a bad person trying to be good, but instead a sick person trying to get well.... But damn, this disease has given me this stupid anti-power to just not want better for myself and to self sabotage by drinking.

My alcoholism is the worst it's ever been. I'm still standing, but I know that the rug is gonna get pulled from underneath me soon if I don't stop. I look back at pictures of me from a few years ago, and I see the toll this disease has taken on me. I see a woman who had hope. I was proud of myself. My smile was genuine. I want that again.

I want my life back. I want to be a respectable person again. I know I can do this... But I definitely can't do it alone. I love my sponsor, but it might be time to find one closer to home. I'm ashamed to walk back in the rooms and say, ""welp, I'm back again""... I feel like they'll just roll their eyes and say to themselves ""eh, she'll be gone in a week"".

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge! **I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.** After all, we did it today!

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Is there hope?,"I'm a 35 year old woman who has been binge drinking on an accelerating basis. It used to happen maybe once a month. But I've spent the last 3 weekends - beautiful, blue sky, October weekends - in bed hungover. Most of my drinking happens in private because I get so much anxiety. But the recent drinking has prompted some unusual behavior. I woke up 2 weeks ago and saw that I had had a 90 minute phone conversation with an ex boyfriend. I recalled none of it. Last night, I went to my oldest friend's wedding and pounded 5 glasses of white wine. I don't remember how I got home or if I embarrassed myself at the event. I do however, have a large red wine stain on my floor from a bottle I clearly decided to purchase after the wedding to take home. 

I've struggled with this for so long now. Years and years. 3 years ago, I took a temporary job in another city where I didn't know anyone. I used it as an excuse to get wasted all the time. I would do really immature things like buy 2 bottles of wine and a birthday cake and eat it for dinner. I would go on Tinder and flirt dangerously with men. One time, I was wasted and actually went to a hotel and met one of them at 3 am. So fucking dangerous. I made myself so vulnerable on so many occasions.

When I returned home from that job after 6 months, I quit. The last straw (I thought) was sleeping through my alarm and missing my flight home from that other city. I was so devastated I shelled out $2000 to get on the next flight just to get the fuck out of there. I was shaking and sweating the whole plane ride home. About 5 months of sobriety went by and I fucked up. A hard partying friend came into town and I didn't know how to explain to him that I was sober. I thought our friendship would be over. Not that I gave him a chance to prove me otherwise. In any case, predictably, that kicked me off to a new wave of drinking. Picked up right where I left off. And now I'm here. In bed, head pounding, needing to go out to a pre-scheduled dinner where I'll pretend I don't feel like the walking dead. 

I feel like I am drowning and the only person who can help me is me, but I'm not strong enough to be my own hero. I feel exhausted. Like I've tried to quit so many times without success that I would be kidding myself to try again. I feel so uninterested in helping this human being (me), who I find so repulsive and irredeemable. My memory is so bad these days. I feel like I am in a fog even when I'm sober. And yet a continue to go to work and look normal. Because I am high functioning, I sometimes don't even believe I have a problem. So.... simultaneously, I feel like I a) am going to die from this disease if nothing changes, and b) I am overreacting and being self involved. I don't know. I don't know.

I could really use some words of wisdom from anyone out there who has been in my shoes and seen this story have a different ending. Because I am terrified. Thank you in advance.",3

I had been sober since early Jan and journaled as part of my healing process. I started drinking again mid-March. I had found out about a week before that my husband had re-started an affair with the woman he had an affair with for the better part of two years. I left temporarily but still did not drink. After much consideration and discussion, I decided to give it another shot, this time being more intentional and tuned in, which I thought being sober would help with.

The following weekend, we went to his friend’s house and stayed overnight because they live far away. I didn’t drink for hours but then caved. Why? Because the boys were downstairs and I was left with the friend’s wife, who is lovely but we have never fully clicked. We were running out of things to talk about and I was becoming increasingly self-conscious. I proceeded to drink a bottle of wine plus one glass. I felt stupid the next day and physically horrible.

I read over my journal and found that I drank four out of eight nights, including that night. ‘One night’ of drinking quickly turned into something regular and after those eight nights it only increased. It really highlighted my inability to moderate and reminded me of one of the reasons why I don’t want to drink.

I wasn't expecting everyone to be super positive, but was pretty disturbed that even people with years of sobriety chose to share stories about what a screw up they used to be..a couple of people were relasped, some cried .there wasn't one single positive share. I obviously wasn't comfortable with every time some one spoke that had to say alcoholic after their name...and other rituals that just seem weird to me...

I gave up booze for 20 days then changed my drinking habits (no drinking multiple days in a row, 2 drinks max, no drinking more than once per week). In that time I lost 10 pounds and my anxiety dramatically improved. I slept better. My mind felt at ease.

Fast forward to last night. My husband and I hosted our annual Halloween party. I drank entirely too much, puked, passed out, and have spent the day throwing up and cycling through anxious thoughts. I feel like a failure, and the worst part is I know I could have had so much more fun at our party had I been sober. I could have had better conversations with our guests, I would have cleaned up the mess last night, and I would wake up today feeling rested.

Truthfully, my drinking habits to most people probably seem tame. I am generally able to tell when I’ve had enough. I occasionally overdo it but hey, who doesn’t? I’m not a mean drunk and I never drive. So what’s the big deal?

I can make excuses all day, but today I’ve decided that drinking does not serve me. Alcohol has not made my life richer. It has robbed me of time. Today I nursed a hangover instead of taking a walk and enjoying the autumn leaves. Today I drank water all day instead of going out for lunch because I can’t keep food down. Today I cycled through thoughts of shame and guilt instead of reading a great book or playing my guitar.

I have decided to stop drinking. I’m excited to make my life better. I will not drink with you today.",19

I tend to over-do it, and whenever I go out I wake up with the worst anxiety that I may have done or said something dumb the night before. 

It's only gotten worse over the past six months. My little sister died in March, and I've definitely been drinking to cope. I've had maybe five days total since then where I haven't had any drinks at all, and lots of days where I've had too much. 

Last night, I went out with a new group of friends. I only had three or four drinks, but I hadn't eaten at all, and I blacked out and passed out, massively embarrassing myself in front of all these people I barely know. I am absolutely mortified and it has been eating me alive all day. I've known I have to do something about my drinking for a long time, and this was a huge kick in the ass. This needs to stop now.

I have zero drive to do anything.  My wife and kid are staying at my inlaws place after my last crazy incident.  I dont know what to do to fix this - I want to go to rehab but again the drive is not there right  now.  I feel like if I get out of bed and out of the house I will definitely go to a liquor store - so I'm afraid to leave the house.  

I've tried AA - hearing all the stories just wanted me to drink more.  I have a therapist but what's the point when I only tell them half the story and omit details. I've seen a psychiatrist, and was diagnosed with depression.  Was given some strong antidepressants but I just feel like it's made my lethargy even worse.

I dont know what to do - I have all the support in the world, my wife wants me to get better but right now my head has concluded that that was the last straw, and she cant take it anymore. I do not blame her.  

I've been reading a lot of posts.  Started read this naked mind.  But all I want is to be alone or go to vegas, drink and gamble.  

There are a lot more things racing in my mind but just dont want to type anymore.  This is what has happened.  Laziness has taken over my body.

I signed up for a Spanish class and dropped out two weeks later. I tried to start regularly exercising countless times and always gave up pretty quickly. This time feels different. This time feels like it's going to stick. And all that other stuff feels way more attainable now. I don't have that same sense of hopelessness about long term change.

I decided to get serious about quitting about a month ago, and it’s been up & down. No horrible nights or blackouts, and several days strung together, but getting through the weekends in particular has been hard. 

Today is Day 5, and I have been working on distractions and trying to enjoy being in the moment to stay sober. Yesterday was tough in spots, but I made it. And then today I was *thisclose* around noon to just saying, screw it, I can have a glass of wine (we all know where that leads). I was pacing around the house, feeling all anxious, picked up a bottle, set it back down. Looked at the dog and said, “ok, we’re going for a walk. And I’ll see how I feel about it when we get back.”  The urge to give in was so powerful in that moment, I actually said, I can’t imagine going for a walk will work or change anything, but I’ll at least try. 

And you know ... I got back home, and I didn’t miraculously feel great, but that 20 minute break got me out of my own head enough to say, ok, I made it this far, I’ll make some lunch and then see how I feel. And turned that into, I’ll have a cup of tea and read my book and see. And somewhere along there my brain dropped the “and then see how I feel line” and it just became, “ok, now I’m going to enjoy the sunshine and this book,” without the idea of “... and then I can have a drink” hanging around.

I am off work tomorrow, its a gorgeous fall day outside, and I ve handled my business this past week with work and school like a boss. I guess Im still adjusting to not being able to drink to celebrate my accomplishments  anymore.  Drinking was something i used to destress after a mentally draining day, until it lead to more stress, anxiety, and health problems

Its funny how those shitty thoughts can sneek up on ya. Ive been feeling good about my sobriety so far but days off can be challenging, that fuck it voice is a lil bit louder.  

Its feels therapeutic to write on this forum and analyze my emotions and really try to understand the root of my thinking towards drinking. It helps me to understand why so many of us get dragged back into the cesspit of drunkeness and hangovers and that cycle of rinse and repeat, despite the best of intentions.  Previously to my sobriety, handeling my emotions consisted of drowing them in vodka.  

I realize my thought process got me there and my thought process can get me out. Is my irritation and antisocialnesss part of PAWS or just normal head fuckery? Maybe both idk. 

Regardless, im determined not to drink today and im gonna go do some positive shit like clean the house enjoy the fall sunshine, and just fucking live my life the way god intended.  If god wanted us all to be alcoholics he would have put ethanol in our mothers breastmilk.  Anyways done with the rant,hope everyone is having a good Sunday and thanks for listening to my bullshit.

So... it's been a rapid slide into alcoholism over the past six months. My husband has been sick for most of the time that I knew him, and six months ago he finally succumbed to his illness and passed away. About a year before he died, I began to drink one or two shots 3-4 nights a week, but no more. Just enough to ease the tension, you know? But after he passed away, it upped instantly to several shots a night and at least one double shot of Jack, simply because I couldn't stand seeing his face after he died. Whenever I was sober (in the morning, at work, or in the middle of the night), his final moments and his blank eyes would play in my mind over and over again. I miss him so much that it's hard to stand it.

The thing is that I've always known that this kind of lifestyle is untenable. I have a young daughter, a wonderful mother, fantastic in-laws, and a great new job that starts in one week. My husband wouldn't want me to barely stumble through the day, pretending like mad to be normal (so exhausting), and then drink from the moment I get home until I go to bed. Taking care of my daughter while permantly tipsy is hard, and I fear that I'm not always succeeding at it. I need to be better at taking care of her, and I WANT to be better at it. She deserves so much more than a sad, sloshed mom.

So I have a week off while transitioning from my old job to the new, and I've firmly decided that tomorrow will be the first day that I will stop drinking. The only problem is this; while taking care of my husband when he was ill, as well as working, cleaning the house, and tending to a very young child, all of my hobbies and interests have fallen to the wayside. I don't really know what to do with myself for the next week while I'm kicking this terrible habit. 

Help me? What did y'all do during the first week while y'all shook and sweated out your demons? Did any of y'all have a child you took care of alone during this time?

Edit: I thank you all for your compassion and excellent advice. This is day one, and I plan to spend it hanging out with my daughter, watching movies, reading, and catching up on housework. Keep your fingers crossed for me, everyone. IWNDWYT",45

Which then led to me explaining when I picked her up later why I had them in the first place. She was extremely supportive and completely non judgemental.

I answered that one as best I could before my embarrassment/shame got the better of me. The trust that she has put in me to drink is amazing. She has pretty severe cerebral palsy and isn't able to walk, but she's trusting that when I disappear now to go get us food or something from upstairs, or turn off lights, or anything else it might be, that I'm just doing that, and not sneaking a drink.

I’ve been trying to quit drinking. I’ve been doing okay. My badge is fucked - somewhat obviously. But I (incorrectly) believe that during homecoming, especially with my group of friends, drinking is an inevitability. 

The last two years hoco I blacked out by NOON. Smashed dishes, spent most of the day passed out. So I was NOT looking forward to this. 

Yesterday I made it to 10pm, drinking moderately and not blacking out. I felt like this was a MAJOR victory. I felt like I moderated well, spent the day partying with my friends and having fun. 

But my partner told me after 10pm I got aggressive. I wouldn’t let him off the wall, I pushed arguments that shouldn’t have even happened, I made our guests uncomfortable. I’m so unbelievably disappointed in myself I don’t have words. I felt like I did okay. I felt like I was sociable, responsible, I thought I could DO the drinking thing like normal people do. 

But moderation doesn’t exist. It just... can’t happen. My partner seems to think I have character flaws, but I don’t. I know I’m a good person but drinking just... transforms you entirely. It’s like I’m another person I don’t even recognize. Goes against all morals and instincts. I hate it. I need to stay sober. Today’s the first day I considered going to AA but as a 20 year old I feel out of place.

I have been married for 46 years but dated or knew my wife 8 years before that, all the way back to eighth grade. She truly is a life partner and has experienced many ups and downs with me.

I am the primary caregiver now that she has been diagnosed with inoperable cancer.  Funny the illness brought us closer.  Recently, I have found myself angry at the cancer, demands on me, and the ""unfairness"" of it all.  A couple of times I caught myself angry at her.  I know that I am not mad at her.  I am mad about the situation.  I love her and I know when she passes I will miss her greatly.

I have five months sober.  Her illness came up after I quit drinking.  I am glad I am sober and able to be here for her without being hungover every morning.  

I appreciate this ability to share my thoughts with other people going through a variety of challenges.  I will not drink with you today.

I have been out with friends who drink, but I get easily bored now because listening to them after a few drinks gets tedious and noisy. 
I try to make plans for coffee during the days instead, but most of my friends are crazy busy with work and their families, so that is also a bit hard to plan around. 
Si I end up spending most weekends and weeknights watching Netflix. And that’s getting a bit old too. 

I don’t want to go back to drinking, but it really has changed my social life around in a very big way, and I need to find a new way to connect with people, because it turns out that a lot of my relationships centered around weekend drinking...

I passed out at 10pm, now I'm wide awake and can't sleep. I'm so so thirsty, my stomach feels like shit, and I can't fathom the destruction I did last night in my life; the hurtful texts that I will have to face in the AM but I can't remember now. 

Reading this naked mind has challenged my beliefs, but I'm now ready to leave alcohol in the dust. This is not the life I want to live and I'm tired of this feeling, day after day. I may only be 26F, but I can't imagine drinking my 1-2 wine bottles daily for the rest of my life. That's absurd and a sure-fire way to die an early death. 

I've been terrified of not drinking because I truly believed that it made me more sociable, likable, and funny. I'm now realizing it doesn't; in fact, I have so much more meaningful connections when I'm sober and not drunk at the bar (I just tend to forget this). Drunk me is embarrassing, sad, and hurtful. The line between happy drunk and aggressive/hurtful is a very fine line for me now. There's friends I've lost, family who refuse to answer my texts/calls, and bars I avoid out of embarrassment of what I did there drunk. Alcohol adds nothing to my life. 

Here's to the start of a new chapter ❤️to feeling emotions again, to having actual sleep, to having energy throughout the day, to feeling healthy again, and to have genuine fun without alcohol.

The weekends have also been hard, because a week of normalcy I find myself wanting to rage. But I haven’t and I won’t. 

I know one day at a time is the mantra here, but I can’t help but look at the future and feel sorta bummed that alcohol may very well be not in my life (I’m 26, feeling young yet sort of old because I have a 4 year old son). What am I going to do at parties, will it be fun? But at the same time I do feel excited to not have regretful alcohol induced night. Nights I wouldn’t remember if I had been drinking. Yet I also know I can have a lot of fun without it. I guess that’s the demon of addiction trying to convince me otherwise. 

I do feel a sense of peace. I feel proud. I feel my life slowly coming together and some consistency and discipline, which my life very well needed. I have a long way to go. But the perspective gained in just a month is enough to want me to keep it going. Sober.

I did pick up smoking cigs again occasionally so I will have to tackle that yet again (I quit 6 months ago). My diet also went to shit. But I am trying!! I owe a lot to this sub, and the few random sober people I know in life. Lots of motivation and love from both sources. Best of luck.",4

I agreed with myself I would post this in the hope it can help others see how not drinking can be a real gamer changer to improve your life!!! 

**Drinking and me**

  I don't have a drink problem, I can take it or leave it...most of the time. My issue with alcohol is how it leads me to do cocaine and constantly in a cycle of *smoke cigs socially with a drink then all the time, then quit and repeat* 😒. My level of self control with alcohol is terrible and often I would throw up (weak stomach) and would ruin most nights sleep (if I ever woke up after a drink at night it was so challenging to get back to sleep).

It blows my moral compass to drug use out of the window and can cause my serious issues in my relationship (poly drug use for me used to be bad, not H or crack). 

**So Xmas Eve....**

  I was away for the holidays with my partners parents in a place very far away where I knew almost no one. Decided to meet an old mate ""for a couple of pints"" and long story short, after 2 pints I mention to my mate, who mentions to his bro and £80 later I have some actually not bad cocaine. 

Ended up smashed and even doing lines in a alleyway on my own off my phone, really made me feel like shit. Was the moment of ""you are better than this, this visit without this evening would be x1000 better, **time to change**"".

Got back, unable to sleep and Xmas day was a haze of the worst hangover ever which was only beaten by the shame of spending money like that and being coked up around poeple I shouldn't. Just because I didn't get caught doesn't make it any less disrespectful to people I deeply care about. 

That was it. Said never again and today is day 300 of no alcohol. I was so fucking proud I can say I have not had a single drop. I find it fine to be around people drinking but I do go to the pub way less. Took about 4 months to get to that point for me. 

I still smoke cannabis (never with baccy) and while not ideal, I haven't smoked cigs at all this year and done almost no coke, never when not planned to. An expensive habit I don't miss cocaine. Have had long period (up to 2 months) of only cannabis occasionally, big step forward for me!! Plan to deal with both of these too but one step at a time. 

**Alcohol free positives**
  - Never hungover 
- Easier to stay good weight 
- Easier to keep up running each week
- Eat better
- Save **LOADS** of cash
- Get up early and go to bed early 
- More positive 
- Feel in control 
- More active
- Less unplanned chaos
- Find it easy not to do cocaine (done a few times this year, much more take or leave now)
- Not smoked/Vaped/inhaled any tobacco

I plan to never drink again, for me been such a better year. If you struggle with other drugs, quitting alcohol makes not doing them so much easier!!!! 

  **Many others alcohol free for 2019?**

I loved it everything about it I loved so much. I was a shy person and so alcohol made me more social so I could talk to cute girls. Fast forward 18 years. I got 3 dui's, a 2nd degree felony assault on my record and multiple other tickets related to alcohol. beat the shit out of two women I loved. Got divorced over it. Have three young daughters ages 13, 8, and 5. My oldest knows I'm a drunk and dumps my stuff if she finds it talks about committing suicide because of me :,( doesn't even like me anymore as a person my younger two don't understand that Daddy has an illness although they seen and been through the fights I've had with my ex's witch I'm sure tramatiesd them for life. I know it did. I was a functioning alcholoic for many years got my associates degree in electronics and got a good job making $27/hr best benefits ever. And lost that due to drinking on the job lost another great job due to drinking on the job. Now unemployment, divorced, lost two other great gals because of alcohol and I beat the shit out of them so many times they couldn't take it anymore. I also have anger issues obviously that really when combined with drinking make me go through the roof and freak the fuck out over little things that shouldn't bother a normal person. And shit escalate's from there. Now here I sit unemployment, no license, probably going to do some jail or prison time for my felony assault and other DUI I just got. Not charged yet. Only thing I got left Is my house and my kids. I'm about to loose my house a very nice house on a hobby farm with animals. My credit is shit after filing for bankruptcy a few years ago so I will never ever be able to buy another one like the nice place I have out here in the country. Yes I think I have hit rock bottom for me and I know I need to quit and I've tried unsuccessfully over the years going 3 months sober was my longest. My dad was an alcoholic and my grandfather was an alcholoic, my brother is an alcholoic and so I know it runs in my blood. I just signed up for treatment and know this for a fact that I never ever want to touch the shit ever again. I know it won't be easy but I gotta do it for my kids they need a father who isn't drunk all the time. Here's to day 1. Pray for me. :,(",64

I've had a tough year. My girlfriend broke up with me(not alcohol related). I changed jobs, and some other stuff going on that just made it a tough year so far. 

But after the breakup I decided to try again with this and I'm glad I did. If you want some feel good stuff from this:

1. I started building a greenhouse.
2. I entered my first painting competition.
3. I'm earning more and getting more responsibility in work.
4. I'm saving all that booze money.
5. I'm painting more.
6. I've been present and reliable for people.
7. Ive started to learn to drive.
8. Im also working on my motorbike license.
9. I finally have surgery booked to fix my ankle.
10. I cleaned my bookshelf.

So thats 10 things that probably wouldn't have happened in the last 3 months.

Things I want to work on:

1. Eating healthier. Im eating so much rubbish lately!
2. Get reading more. Sick of my smartphone and endless scrolling.
3. Become a morning person. My never ending battle to go to bed early.
4. Start playing more boardgames.

Those are just a few anyway.

To the day 1'ers. Its worth it. Stick around here and give it a shot. It took me many goes. The longest I had was 7-8 months and I'm gunning for a year. But the main one is today! Just not today! 

Anyway, no pints for me today! :)",16

But the Day 1 stories that pull on some thread of being “simply too emotionally tired to carry on like this” really resonate with me.  Fact is, the money will flow back into the bank account over time... the bruises on our elbows and knees will heal... and our loved ones and friends always accept the latest apology even if we frankly don’t deserve another chance.  But being too emotionally tired to continue the full time job that is being an alcoholic was the point that I found myself in one Monday morning 27 days ago and the very thought of returning to another Day 1 is what kept me from accepting a double IPA, a glass of rose’ or a glass of my absolute fucking favorite red wine last night with my wife and some brand new friends we hung out with for the first time.

It hit me, that the non alco beers were like a placebo, uninhibiting any social awkwardness but allowing me fill clarity over my actions. 

The person I was on drink was the same person I am completely sober. The fun was the same. I was the same. And after everything I went home and have a great nights sleep. Today everyone is wrecked, hungover, getting sick etc and I'm ready for the second day of my weekend. 

I read about this feeling on other posts here and never thought that two months in I'd be the person to feel like I can have fun without drinking.

So I’ve been heavily drinking since my miscarriage and just overall hard 3 years I’ve had. To sum it up, I was sick 3 years ago and was  sick for about a year and a half with chronic pain and I needed high attention. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and 4 months. He was only with me for such a short time before he had to start taking care of me, escorting to the bathroom, taking baths, etc. We were long time close friends for years before we decided to be serious and he automatically took the position of making sure I am ok. 

I have been better for a while now but still getting back on my feet after a huge hit in our financial lives. 

We miscarried earlier this January, he has strongly worked through it and I am obviously struggling. 

I drink everyday, a bottle or a bottle and a half. Black out just about every night. I need to get better but somehow can’t say no. 

I have no willpower to say no to a bottle or even just scrapping a dollar together in change to get a shooter. 

I don’t understand why i’m so scared to quit. I mean obviously I have issues but I’ve never been a person to be dependent. And now I am. 

My relationship with this amazing man who I am so in love with is slowly being crushed due to my own issue of drinking and him having again after all these years to look after me. 

I need to know how to say no. He tells me I just don’t do it but doesn’t know how to emphasize on that because it isn’t an issue he has ever had. 

Please someone emphasize how to just do it. To just stop. I would really appreciate it.",5

I believe the last time was this past February or March. Since then, I've been to AA (it either wasn't for me or I'm not ready for it) and have had a couple good sober stretches, with my last one being 100 days exactly. That stretch ended in September, shortly after one of my best friends threw himself off of a parking garage. 

It doesn't matter why I started drinking again. There are plenty of excuses, and I employed them all against my better judgement. It only took me about a month to bottom out this time. 

On a visit home, I wound up shirtless and shoeless in my parents' backyard squatting against an old cedar tree. I was ""hiding"" from my dad, worried he was going to take me to the psychiatric hospital ""like he did mom"". Ouch. It's the worst thing I could say to him. And why did I say it?  Because he was politely trying to coax me inside to get out of the cold. In addition to that incident, I've missed work twice because I was still hammered/too hungover to make it to the office, and almost every night I've drank I've blacked out and called my friends weeping (as if their grief isn't enough to try deal with).

I'm back in therapy now, slowly easing back into a more normal routine (I realize I'm posting this at 5am, ha), attempting to follow through on all my daily non-negotiables, and trying to show myself some self-compassion instead of self-loathing. 

Anyway, it's 5am. I should've been asleep ages ago, but at least I didn't drink. At least (for now) I'm not continuing down the path of slowly killing myself in front of my friends. They deserve better than that. I deserve better than that. 

Thanks for listening. Glad to be back.",4

I’m 34, I’ve never had a DUI, I’ve never abused anyone while intoxicated. Actually, by all accounts, I’m quite enjoyable when I’m drunk. But now that our friend group is mostly married with children, and I’m not, I just find myself drinking alone because I’m bored or I date and find that the crux of the date is centered around a bar and I’m just a bit over it. 

For the last 15 years I’ve lived on my own and away from family. It’s been a pretty solitary lifestyle and I always fell back on drinking. I actually get anxious about the thought of finding an excuse to not order a drink on a date. But I’m also not at all religious so AA (or at least my likely flawed idea of it being religious) doesn’t seem like a thing I want. I don’t know. Rambling obviously. I just don’t know how to start.",20

...and it’s also my current streak!

I’ve not got a huge amount else to say. It’s not been easy, but it’s not been horrendous either. Sobriety very much feels like the new normal now.

My mental and physical health are so much better. Family relationships are stronger than ever and being present with my kids is a blessing.

I still have a very long way to go, particularly on the career front, which took a beating because of my drinking. But, there are green shoots there too.

I am looking forward to my health getting even better and I hope that the constant aches & pains will go away eventually. But, hey, maybe that’s just me getting old!

All the best SD. I will still browse here every day.

Woke up vomiting and hungover. My husband had to help me get dressed for work. Calling in sick at my job really puts my coworkers in a bind (healthcare). It’s pretty physical work, and we all do our best to carry our weight so others don’t have to. I absolutely love what I do. But today, I refused to admit to myself that my terrible habits made me too sick to provide for my family. 

Surprise! I barely made it 4 hours into my shift before I had to call someone to relieve me. Ironically, the coworker I called was the one I went out with the night before. (She was incredibly understanding and I owe her BIG for coming in to work for me.) She had zero hang over and obviously had a completely different, more responsible night than I did. 

Here I am. Still hungover on my couch while my husband went to the movies and is enjoying his Saturday evening. Once again, I’m embarrassed and ashamed of my relationship with alcohol. I hate myself so much for not being in control.

I'm new. I've been reading posts here the past few days and I see a lot of good advice being sent by more experienced people which is very cool.

I'm a 26M and roughly I've been drinking heavily almost everyday since I was 17 years old. I'm 14 days sober now. I want to quit as I acknowledge it is ruining my life at this point (I'll probably bring more details on this in the future).

The last few days have been hard to me regarding the cravings, but I did quit smoking a couple years ago after 5 years of cigarettes and I kinda already know how craving a substance works in my own body, which I think is a very good thing to start this journey.

The cravings come and go but there's one thing that remains after: boredom. Drinking whenever I could was part of my life. Usually a lot of beer, sometimes vodka when beer couldn't get me drunk enough to pass out somewhere inside my own apartment.

Now that I'm 14 days clean I feel so bored all the time. When drinking, the little things like watching some series on Netflix, playing Xbox or cooking something new I saw online felt so much more interesting than it is now.

This is really bothering me and some advice would be much appreciated.",8

She doesn’t drink much at all but seemed ok with my drinking. 

Then our daughter came along 11 yrs ago. And over the last 2yrs she was claiming how embarrassed our kid would be, when her friends wouldn’t be allowed to come over because daddy smelled like booze. It really made me feel like shit. 

I went to a therapist, but I kept drinking. I went to out patient treatment, but I kept drinking. AA and Smart Recovery didn’t work either. 

Towards the end she started to say the meanest things about how I was just like my narcissistic mom and telling me I’d have to move out if I kept it up. I kept drinking. 

It was actually when I was bitching in r/deadbedroom. That a redditor told me to come here and sort myself out for the sake of my kid. And somehow I just decided to stop. 
I’ve had a lapse or two, but for the most part I’m healing the part of me that wants to bury the pain. 

It’s just that even as the wife gets friendlier, I have flashes of why her behavior made me depressed.  And in the back of my mind I haven’t forgotten what she’s said. 

I’m sticking around for the kid.  But I’m not sure what to do about my marriage.",2

And a few awesome people gave me ideas. I stopped drinking September 27th. Which was one day before a NF concert I went to with my best friend who has been sober for 2 years. Crazy thing is, her and I became friends 13 years ago when we snorted a vicodin together the first night we met...obviously not knowing we'd become best friends through our using days and eventually when we both went to rehab at certain points in our lives. The night we went to the concert, she had 2 years under her belt and I had 1 day. My sobriety lasted 22 days before I relapsed. I had every intention on doing a puzzle with husband tonight while sipping some tea and being proud of myself. But it didnt happen. We went to the casino because it was me who said, ""lets go do something! We stay at home every night of our lives, we have no kids tonight."" I dont like to gamble but I thought I'd take one for team (aka my amazing husband who can gamble without drinking & stop after losing 40 bucks) and try the slots. Wow i was winning and it was fun. I stayed away from the bar..easy peasy. Then a waitress came and asked if she could get me a drink. Michelob Ultra I replied. I drank it...followed by a few more. I'm sitting here typing this, slightly buzzed after 5 drinks and I'm not going to beat myself up. If I do, I know its going to follow with more drinking and depression. I messed up. But out of 23 days, I had some drinks ONE night. Which is my best streak I've ever had in over 2 years when I was drinking a 12 pack EVERY night. And 3 years ago, I was popping 12 vicodin every night on top of it. Tonight.....I'm proud of myself. I'm human and I'm going to mess up sometimes. I'm getting back on the sober train starting now.

Last night i was drinking with my mate who is going through it as well. It felt good to talk to someone who can really relate to what's is like, how hard it can be. 

My depression came back full force, and everything else crumbled with it. 

I know i can do this. Today i did my washing for the first time since relapse, cleaned my room and all the cans. Im about to go back in to the gym which was a lifesaver during my sobriety.

Last month I finally started seeing a therapist and I admitted to her that I didnt want to be a drinker anymore. I'm a mom of two young boys and I come from a family of alcoholics and I want to stop the cycle. ""The problem,"" I told her ""is I string together significant periods of sobriety and then I start all over again."" She then goes, ""Well you're going to have to stop relapsing and get treatment"" I laugh, ""I was afraid you would say that.""

Her and I discussed two options 1. Outpatient Treatment or 2. AA - 90 meetings in 90 days. I chose AA meetings mainly because I felt that it wouldnt require as much work and wouldnt draw too much attention to my 'problem.' My husband is going to be the only one that notices me going to meetings; an outpatient program would be much more difficult to hide. 

That decision was made 10/8/2019 during my Therapy session. Since then I had my last horrah drinkining Wednesday 10/13/2019 and have attended 3 AA Meetings. Here is where I am today: I want to be a non-drinker and I know in my head that I can't be that without treatment/help because I am an alcoholic. However, the last 3 AA meetings have clearly demonstrated that I have NOT accepted I am an alcoholic in my heart yet. This means I will continue to relapse. So, in AA I will be; I want long term sobriety so much.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
________________________________________
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, *we make a conscious decision not to drink.*
 It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes, impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good evening or Good morning! I have 9 more days with The Husband working down in NC for this whole month. It's been up & down for me during this time. Great fun with our granddaughter, I started at a new gym that I love & I joined a ""Focus Group"" at my former IOP for successful ""graduates."" I don't like the part of town it's in but I have enjoyed seeing many of the people I was in Group with for a year & a half! I have also lost another girlfriend to suicide out in San Diego. She was 45 & left a 12 year old daughter. No one seems to have seen this coming. I worked with Renee for many, many years at our little island hospital. I thought she & her life were perfect while *my* life had all the craziness. I feel real bad I didn't stay in closer touch with her after we moved. She did not leave anyone a note at her death.

I tend to treat myself with a couple of pints after a few days off, the next day 4, then 8, then a weekend bender on anything I can get my hands on. 2 days in bed with it firing out both ends. 2 days off it, then  rinse and repeat. It's been 20 years. 

I'm on day 14 after deciding enough was enough. Came home in such a state that my daughter was crying. I dont rember, but she will. The better half had her bags packed. Enough is enough.

My dad died due to drink. My brother isnt far of either. It's a family trait, and I think I might have cracked it.

I dont feel the need to drink alcohol. I've been drinking alcohol free beer to take the edge off and it's working. I haven't broke the habit of going to the pub. I enjoy it, but something has clicked and dont feel the need to get pissed anymore. Packed in the ciggies too. 

I'm hoping this sticks.

I'm here because I don't like myself when I drink. I can't seem to enjoy a couple of drinks and call it a night: I get caught up in the perceived frivolity and joy of alcohol and social ease, but that translates to regret and dissapointment in myself the next day. 

No matter how much reassurance I get from friends, or my husband, on those occasions I can't shake the feeling that I've lowered everyone's opinion or perception of me. I try to live my life as a considerate person sober: I worry I lose that when I binge drink. 

Mine's not an unusual story. I'm anxious and depressed by nature, and will likely be on medication for that, and other conditions, long term. I shouldn't drink anyway, but I long to feel loved and accepted in social settings. Alcohol has been marketed in our culture as a way to achieve that, and I've fallen for it. 

After 69 days last Friday, I fell off the wagon. I want to climb back on happily.",3

They're valid too of course, but it's such a great feeling meeting another person who just, doesn't drink.

My boyfriend drinks maybe twice a year. He hasn't drank since I announced I was quitting, he hasn't had a reason to and honestly he doesn't see much appeal in it. However, he introduced me to one of his close friends that recently moved to our town and that guy doesn't drink! He says he just doesn't see a reason to. His hobbies involve things that require a sober mind and he doesn't like the feeling of being intoxicated.

Then, as it turns out, almost all of my boyfriend's friends don't drink. It's refreshing to know that there are people I can be around that won't pressure me to drink unlike my friends or people who I'm trying to make friends with. 

Soon we might be starting a DnD campaign together, which will be an alcohol free event I can attend with friends. 

I look forward to meeting more people like them, and maybe making some sober friends of my own. Being a young alcoholic makes it hard to find people my age who are also sober, especially where I live. Or hell, even just people that won't judge you for being young and sober. But I can see that there's hope now and it feels good. 

I'm ready to dive in to sobriety and the hobbies I love that drinking gets in the way of!

All of my friends started drinking between age 15 and 18. I just never felt like it, but have to admit I was curious to how it felt and would make me feel. What ""type of drunk"" I would be. Energetic, extra sociable, funny, dancing or singing. My friends all told me I had to drink to be able to not be uncomfortable at parties. 
But I was too worried about the other ""types of drunk"" I could become. Like violent, loud, annoying, out of control. I really like staying under control. I was also worried I would start abusing it and ""drink to forget"", because i feel I have the personality to do just that.
And to begin with, everyone were pushing me to try ""just a little bit"" and asked me why I don't drink. ""I'm not old enough, and will get my license if i wait"" (i did) worked for a while. ""I don't like the taste"" had a 50% chance of working. ""I don't want to"" created very different reactions, some tried to push it on me, some abandoned me, some accepted it. That was when I started thinking ""Why do I have to explain or even lie for people to accept me and my choice?"" Which in a way, strengthened my decision. 
As the years went by I soon realized how much money people spend on alcohol and partying in general. I usually spent between 1/5 and 1/10 of my friends. Some got physically hurt, some got big fines. Some even got accused of rape and sexual harassment, and were too drunk to remember if it even happened. They still asked me why I don't drink. After a while the new people I told i didn't drink started saying it was strong of me to never try, that it was a wise decision, and ""wow, you must save a lot of money!"". Still, I'm the only one I know my own age that don't drink. So why am I the only one if they think it's a good idea to not drink? This started messing with me. 
I found this group, and it showed me how people who have been through a lot has been incredibly strong and turned an addiction around, who praise sobriety and it's effects on their lives. It has helped me to stay true to myself and my decision to never start drinking. I want to be the example that shows it's possible to be young, party, go to the club and socialize without getting drunk or changing themselves to be more open, social and energetic.  So yeah, thank you guys for showing me that there are some people out there that are sober and proud :)",14

I've had absolutely awful sleep this past week but I think I've stumbled on a solution after doing research and trying a frightening number of supplements.

Finally what ended up working for me is [Glycine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397399/) + [Magnesium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212970/) combo. tl;dr on those links - ""it works, but we don't know why""

Glycine is practically in everything but taking 3 grams of it with 500mg of magnesium seems to do the trick in that it not only makes me sleepy but also keeps me asleep longer. Interestingly, just magnesium or glycine alone isn't quite as effective.

Where’s the rainbows and unicorns?,"The first three weeks of this I was having a great time, felt super motivated, I was “happy” about my lack of drinking. I was in the gym five days a week making progress on my lifts way faster than when I was drinking (duh?). A month ago I pulled a muscle in my back and had to take a week off,. After that week it just felt easier to not exercise and go home and be mad about how much I hate my damn job instead. A body at rest will want to stay at rest I guess is the physics that would explain how I feel. Haven’t been eating much lately, haven’t been sleeping much, mostly because sleeping feels like a fast forward button to work. 

The last two weeks I’ve been doing three people’s jobs at work and it’s unbearable, but it’s hard to quit when I get paid a lot more than my “qualifications” would justify. Call it the “this job blows ass but we need people to do it” pay bump.  But I know for damn sure if I had been hungover for any of those days, it would have been 200% more unbearable, and likely would have snowballed into me calling in sick multiple days and going on a bender. At least I  wake up at 545 every day feeling physically amazing, but man am I just feeling really fucking drained and empty lately. I even forgot to keep track of my sober days for a whole week and had to catch up my “counter” that I keep on a note pad. 

I’m not sure what I’m trying to accomplish with this post. I guess I just want to bitch. I spent so much time drinking and pushing everyone away and now it’s just me and my sobriety. I had some romanticized idea of sobriety but it turns out I’m still the same old person in the same old situation, just minus a substance. I guess this is just a sad attempt at farming some motivation, I know I need to change the things I don’t like and no one is going to do it but me.

I've been lucky enough to manage the consequences of my recent drinking and take care of the things I needed to do to resume a healthy, sober life.

Today that individual heads home, and it's just me in the apartment. This is traditionally where I've fared rather poorly - I can usually exercise some measure of control with others around, but when left to my own devices, things have gone belly up pretty quickly in the past.

I can't afford that - I've been given some second, and third chances at a few opportunities, and if my sobriety takes a nosedive once more, I'm in fairly dire straights. I would have thought that that alone would be enough to quell the cravings, but I can feel them bubbling under the surface. 

I'm going to do 3 things, that I haven't done in the past: take the whole 1 day at a time approach to heart, and just focus on getting through today only, doing whatever I have to do - no thoughts of ""today AND Sunday???""; attend a support meeting this evening, which I've been reluctant to attend in the past, but which, despite my misgivings, actually seems to be helpful for me; and I'm going to be reading through all sorts of posts on here throughout the day to keep myself in the right mindset, and to hopefully prevent my mind from wandering too much to begin with.

THANK YOU /r/stopdrinking ! 

hearing all your stories, the good, the bad! its put a lot of clarity into my mind.

a year ago i probably wouldnt have admited i had a problem. but eventually after finding this place i realized that waking up every morning feeling like your dying isnt normal and that you can live a better life. 

that no matter how bad life is getting or how deep and dark it all may feel, turning to alcohol as a crutch doesnt help anything. infact as most of us know it makes it a whole lot worse.

this october has been the best month ive had in my quitting adventure since i started to make the mental leap that my life can improve if i quit drinking everday. ive not been perfect but i made it through a wedding only having a toast of wine and one beer (lots of water too). i'm at least a week sober now and before then have been working hard to drastically cut back from daily drinking to one drink a day to one every other day etc. etc.

this is all after months of failure trying to maintain this so im feeling pretty good today.

I did pretty well in AA years ago when I lived in Hawaii, lots of great, intelligent people I could lean on and learn from. I was never able to get the higher power thing though. 

Now I live in a place that generally has a lot less educated/successful people and I can’t relate or get a lot of meaning from the AA meanings I’ve been to, although of course just showing up does help. It’s just with my busy college/work/extracurricular schedule I always felt like AA was a waste of time. Everyone here seems to just have no issue letting a deity be all they need for recovery. 

I’m also generally curious about how this sub feels about stuff like AA aphorisms such as “a sober horse thief is still a horse thief” etc. There are a lot of them and I find them useful but I could see how they could be frowned on.

- an entitled young girl(whom I bet was coming over here to party) was rude to me in the supermarket 
- despite leaving early I was told that there were no tickets for the ferry which meant I might be late for work
- the queue at immigration was off the charts and I was running late
- the taxi driver dropped me off at the wrong venue and I had to run like a crazy woman with strangers pointing me in the right direction
- a colleague who has harassed me was working with me today and it was tense between us
- the gym was closed by the time I checked into the hotel and I found out it only opens after I start work tomorrow 
- the WiFi wasn’t working at the hotel 

But... I’m happy to report I did not have any urges to drink. A few cravings for cigarettes but I managed to sit them out.

Totally knackered now. Going to go to bed and doing yoga before work tomorrow. I think of it as “insurance” against drinking.

I came out and told her last night and I was somewhat surprised at her reaction. Alcohol has often been a source of drama and negativity in our relationship. She knows that I go overboard and we’ve had several serious discussions about my issues with drinking. I expected her to be excited or proud when I broke the news but instead she seemed confused and concerned. When I refused a glass of wine she gave me some grief about it and said “What about tomorrow?”  I’ve noticed there’s a relatively common theme here of friends and family downplaying your decision (“Oh, one beer is fine!”) to stop. 

Do any of you have experience with an SO that still drinks? How did they react when you told them you were no longer going to be drinking and how did it ultimately affect your relationship?",14

I know I don’t post often but we also don’t share our sobriety all that liberally with our families either so I wanted to drop a post here thanking this community for their supportive posts and kindness in dark times.

Over a year ago I posted about how scared I was that my fiancé had alcohol-induced pancreatitis for the second time and how my own drinking habits needed to cease. We’d been hard drinkers for the full eight years we’d been together, and before that as well. We decided it was time to get sober together and I’m thrilled to say that yesterday we got married and DID NOT DRINK.

We did not do shots with my drunk cousin. We didn’t take anyone’s offer to get us a drink. My fiancé—shit, my HUSBAND—kept me stocked with coffee and peach tea, and I made sure he drank plenty of water. We got gifted two bottles of wine from family that wasn’t aware we’ve stopped drinking and they’re going right along to friends who do. 

I’m not going to sit here and say it was easy because it wasn’t. Once family started to arrive I thought “damn now would be a good time to have a drink.” I got a flat tire on my way to get my hair done and someone had dropped beer off early at the venue. All of these instances were tough as hell.

But it’s not impossible. I was proud to look my family and loved ones in the face and not wake up this morning wondering if I said something I’d regret. It’s also not worth it in some respects—that desire to just shut it all out and have a crutch to lean on is real. But I wanted to say to anyone that thinks they can’t do it—it’s just a moment in the day. And that’s all you have sometimes. So thank you to everyone who didn’t drink yesterday and who won’t be drinking with us today!",57
2019-10-19 06:26:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dk1yfa/second_day_sober_venting_i_guess/,Second day sober. Venting I guess.,"I'm 32(F). I started drinking when I was 14 and, although I've never become physically dependent, I would consider myself borderline alcoholic or a problem drinker.

The majority of the time I can't stop once I've started drinking. Anyone I'm with usually wants to go home and go to bed, I'm always the one persuading people to have more drinks. If we do go home, and they do go to sleep, I might stay up drinking on my own until I pass out.

I have put myself in dangerous situations due to my drinking, multiple times. I've had unsafe sex with strangers. I've been robbed and sexually assaulted. I've been paralytic and had to rely on strangers taking me home. I've had a scary brush with the law.

I'm not a nice version of myself when I'm drunk. I've insulted and argued with people when I've been drunk. I've cheated on past boyfriends, leading to the demise of one serious (albeit toxic) relationship (he is an addict too). I've lost and broken countless possessions. I've ruined relationships with family. I've jeopardised my work and career.

At the risk of sounding like a dickhead, I'm fairly intelligent, and I feel I could have achieved a lot more in my life if it wasn't for my drink and drug problems.

I talk about alcohol as the main problem, and it is, but I was once psychologically addicted to ketamine, and at one point heavily used valium, although not long enough to become physically dependent.

I kicked the ketamine and valium problem a few years ago. But alcohol, being so socially acceptable that it is, is a harder one to defeat. And I live in the fucking UK, where binge drinking culture is seen as normal, and even funny.

The majority of people I know, in my personal life or at work, meet at the pub. That's the norm. When I tried to be sober before, I realised how fucking boring the pub is. After about one or two hours of chatting, I want to go home. It's boring, just sitting or standing around, talking shit for hours on end. You can only do that shit for hours if you're drunk and/or high. And then there is the complete and utter tedium of hanging around drunk and/or high people when you're as sober as a judge. And the sweaty alcohol smell radiating from people's armpits is vile. I only ever noticed it when I was sober.

Now here's a problem. The people around me are not taking my choice to go sober seriously. Maybe it's because I'm not on the severe side of the spectrum. The alcoholic everyone has in their mind. The person who wakes up needing a drink, and gets really sick if they stop drinking. No. I never became that type of drinker, because thankfully, somehow, I managed to not let it get that bad. But it COULD get that bad. I could see myself slipping. It creeps up on you slowly.

My boyfriend drinks. And he probably drinks too much. But he knows when to stop. And he never loses control. He never insults anyone, loses anything, puts himself in dangerous situations. When we go drinking together, he wants to call it a night and cuddle in bed. I just want to keep drinking. Often he has gone to bed without me, and I stay up on my own drinking, or with whoever is around and wants to accompany me.

He recognises that I have a problem stopping once I start. He has even admitted (after I told him to be truthful and not worry about offending me) that I'm not a nice version of myself when I'm wasted. He agrees that I have a problem with my drinking, but he seems to think that me cutting alcohol out entirely is extreme. He seems to think I can be a more controlled drinker. But I've been trying to be a controlled drinker for 18 years with no results. It's all or nothing.

Maybe he's in denial. Maybe having a teetotal girlfriend forces him to assess his relationship with alcohol - something that he, an extremely social person, would not want to do.

My flatmate is not being supportive. She drinks too much. This morning at 9.30 am, she and her on-and-off again boyfriend were drinking cans of lager in the kitchen, after staying up the majority of the night drinking. They've now gone out into the the town for another bender.

Of course she'll say I'm normal. Because it's normal for her. But I don't want to drink anymore. I know it't the right thing for me. It's just hard when everyone is downplaying it because it makes them uncomfortable to think about their own relationship with alcohol.

I'm moving out of this house at the end of the year and moving in with my boyfriend in January. I think it's good because my flatmates, lovely as they are, drink all the time. My boyfriend, although he does drink, does not go over the top and I know he would be supportive.

Just wanted/needed to vent. Any thoughts are appreciated. And to everyone else on this sober journey, power to you!

She felt absolutely terrible, but I insisted it was not her fault. I told her “I’m gonna get drunk”. She said “No, you’re not”. I said, “No, I’m not drinking more. I mean, that’s going to go right through me.” Sure enough, my 115lb self caught a buzz for about a half hour, followed by a pretty low, low for around five-ten minutes. Not so fun for someone who was just boasting to her mom about her sobriety today. At this point, I’m choosing to not reset my badge. This was a completely unintentional and isolated occurrence.

1. Be more careful in situations that involve others drinking.
2. Know I have an amazing group of friends and supporters who will love me no matter the mistakes I make.

I went to the doctor and she decided to put me on these medications but I didn't mention that I'm an alcoholic that drinks about 2 to 3 boxes of wine a week. The last time I went to the doctor there (3 years ago?) I wasn't an alcoholic. I really need to contact the doctor again and talk about this. I've been really scared about my life recently.

We spent a few hours outside at a corn field/pumpkin patch and I felt so relieved that I had already stopped drinking and got (what I hope to be) the worst out of the way with withdrawals, there was no chance me a few days or weeks ago could have handled it.

I felt truly proud of myself for my sobriety for the first time since starting, but I still had a pit in my stomach-she knew I drank, but I had gotten good at keeping my intake hidden early and she never knew the full extent.
Even during my withdrawals days ago I texted her about everything but lied and said it was a particularly bad anxiety attack. She's stayed with me through these past two sleepless nights, none the wiser of why I was going through so much and being the amazing girlfriend I've always known her to be.


I didn't think I would be telling her tonight-not that I was planning on keeping it a secret, I had wanted to tell her so many times but I would get a lump in my throat and the words wouldn't come out.
A few hours ago, everything came out flowing. I probably expressed my thoughts terribly and made the situation worse, but she still stayed.

We talked, and cried, and talked more, but at one point it clicked for me; if I could have gone so long without telling her about this issue, would I be able to trust me again if I was in her shoes?

Might be a random post, but it will be more of a diary for me then anything. It's day 3 for me. My last drink was but on the 15th of October. I've hit many bottoms, I've hurt many people, and for some reason it's not enough to keep me away from a drink. My first go around, I was able to maintain 6 months of sobriety by some miracle. I thought the car crashes, the withdrawals, the hospital visits would be enough to keep me away. At my worst I was drinking a liter of rum a day. Mainly at nights, as I am what's refered to as a functioning alcoholic. 

Then my first relapse came about, I was checked into an institution. Somehow my wife thought it was best for me, and I thought it would be too until I lied my way out in order to get back to the bottle. Back to sober, another 90 days gone by, but this time it was different. I had a lot of resentment towards AA and still do, I can't shake the feeling that it isn't for me. Talking to others is great, but some of the ideologies I just can't agree with. When I'm sober I feel great, for the most part. There's some shadows luming underneath, deep down that I can't seem to shake. I do believe that I'm an alcoholic, but only to the extent that I will use anything and everything as a form of escape to my daily life. This makes me angry. Wether it's food, alcohol, gambling, or even just television. I find a way to use it to escape my daily life. I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to be me. I want to be happy. I want my wife and children to be happy. I'm not sure if I need a diagnosis, because I've been this way my entire life. Always needing some sort of instant gratification.

I am having great results with the vivitrol injection.   cravings are under control. I am making it to a couple meetings a week.  drying out is literally waking up from a nightmare.   my life was drinking: drinking after work until bed, poor sleep, then going to work hungover.  every work day,  and extra drinking on days off. every time was the ""the last time"".

how did we get stuck in this nightmarish way of life.   it is so tragic. 

my favorite thing to do lately is my evening stroll while listening to podcasts.  it's not much,  but it's the stuff of life.  alcohol is death.  hopefully my brain will start firing up again and I can feel vibrant again,  like when I was young",55

I feel fresh, I’ve lost some weight on my face despite it being such a short period, I’ve learnt how to order something which isn’t alcoholic at dinner or at bars, I feel like a different person.

Thanks for all the support!

Btw does anyone have any opinions about non-alcoholic beer? I’m currently in USA on my honeymoon and I’m finding it quite hard to come by so haven’t been drinking it but have been doing so when it’s around. I actually like the taste of beer so it kinda makes me feel reassured in social settings and it’s allows me to ease myself into the no alcoholic lifestyle (though I’ve been drinking kids of soda with dinner recently because that’s all there seems to be at the places I’ve been going to..!)",40

I've barely given alcohol a thought, baby is always on my mind and we're so thrilled about it.

That is until tonight. I'm home alone because my fiance is out for dinner for a work function (the company is making friends with a new supplier, they're jewelers). So I went out to the store to pick up chicken wings, and passed several busy bars. It's Friday night downtown, nothing new. It's my first night alone in a very long time though, and my nights alone uses to consist of trips to the liquor store for vodka so there was a memory of that in my mind as I walked. Then upon getting home, I get a text from him. He sends me a photo of his dinner and I noticed the red wine in the background. No big deal, because he's not been the one with the alcohol problem. It would almost be strange for him to decline if the boss was offering.

I guess, I'm still just a bit down about it. And I'm sharing here because I don't want to make him feel badly for something he really shouldn't. It's not that I want to drink, I can feel baby kicking, I'm happy with my chicken wings and night in with the cats. But maybe a small part of me is missing a night of drinking. I feel like a terrible person for feeling this way.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

bell hooks, in her book, *All About Love*, says that ""When we understand love as the will to nurture our...spiritual growth, it becomes clear that we cannot claim to love if we are hurtful and abusive. Love and abuse cannot coexist. Abuse and neglect are, by definition, the opposites of nurturance and care."" My drinking was clearly abuse and neglect of my body, my emotions, and my spirit.

But, bell hooks reminded me also, this was mostly because love wasn't truly modeled in my family, so I didn't learn that skill...***and love is a skill and a practice.*** As I grow deeper into my recovery -- which more and more clearly is not just about alcohol, but those deep roots like my family -- I understand that I want to learn how to truly love myself because only then will I truly be able to love someone else.  ""To truly love, we must learn to mix various ingredients -- care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, and trust, as well as open and honest communication.""

I just turned 40 this year, which hit me REALLY hard.  I've had a few panic attacks over the last couple of years, which made me decide to stop drinking cold turkey about 6 months before my birthday.  I did pretty well.  However, my behavior changed and I was angry and irritable a lot more because I didn't know how to redirect my feelings towards wanting to drink.  I couldn't fall asleep at night at all for the first 2 nights after stopping.  I HATE the idea of just lying in bed, not being able to sleep, which is part of the reason I drink to begin with.  Unfortunately, on my 40th birthday at a surprise party my wife threw for me with a lot of my family and friends present, most of whom drink, I started back up again.

In my mind, I drink to help me fall asleep at night, which I do, but I'm sure it's much deeper than that.  Plus, I have some level of anxiety, but not sure how it compares to others.  I know this is going to catch up with me sooner rather than later, so I'm just trying to fix this before I can't anymore.

What did your family/friends do that helped you quit drinking? Did they do anything that you actually found not helpful?

Context/backstory: I have a sibling who is struggling with profound alcoholism. They started experimenting with alcohol in their teens and it's steadily gotten worse. There are issues of mental health and past traumas that I think have severely compounded the problem. To give you an idea of how bad it is, my sibling regularly day drinks (there is always alcohol hidden throughout  their house, in their car, and even carried on their person at all times), shows up tipsy and sweating/reeking of alcohol to family functions, drives drunk, goes to work tipsy/drunk, and has been hospitalized at least once with a BAC of .41 (important: sibling did not tell anyone in the family about this hospitalization. I found out about it inadvertently. They don't know I know). I can see my sibling physically falling apart before my eyes. They are literally physically unrecognizable to me. They've gained a bunch of weight, are puffy and bloated, perpetually covered in mysterious bruises, hands trembling. My sibling earns really good money, but is constantly strapped (spends all money on booze). 

The worst part is that this is a huge elephant in the room/open secret in my family. We all know there is a problem, and we talk about it among ourselves (behind sibling's back) but we don't address it with them. My mom has tried to talk privately with my sibling about their alcoholism and always gets shut down. My mom also floated the idea of doing an intervention with the whole family, but I've heard that these TV-style interventions don't always work or aren't a great idea. So my mom has now restored to passive aggressive pranks (throwing their booze out, swapping their vodka for water). I really don't know what to say or do to help my siblings. Even if I did, there are so few times nowadays when they're even sober (does it do any good to talk to someone about their problem when they're drunk? I feel like we have more honest conversations when they're intoxicated, but I also suspect they don't remember what we talked about the next day).

Honestly, the situation is taking a toll on my mental health. I regularly have feelings of anxiety and guilt because I'm not doing enough to help them. I have nightmares about them dying. I know that if anything truly horrible were to happen to them my guilt would consume me. My family is just so awkward/dysfunctional though when it comes to taking about important matters... We're all pretty avoidant. I just don't know how to approach the conversation or what I should be doing.",2

- going to use the gym tomorrow morning at the hotel 
- going to check out the spa at other hotels- maybe I can afford it ( the spa at out hotel is for men only!)
-meditation tonight 
- carrying some benzos in case I feel anxious
- carrying a heating pad for my back
- going super early so I don’t feel stressed on the journey there
- going to research how I can get behind the firewall on my mobile

2019-10-18 18:13:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/djuqk8/the_other_side_of_the_coin/,The other side of the coin,"Hi everyone!

I hit a new kind of bottom yesterday. I’ve had bottoms related to my own drinking and drug use before. (My last relapse consisted mainly of smoking weed as an alcohol replacement. It didn’t turn out well.) This was my first bottom related to my powerlessness over someone else’s addiction.

It’s not my first experience dealing with someone else’s substance abuse issues. I’m an alcoholic, I tend to know other people who drink like me. But this is the first time I’ve experienced this sort of powerlessness. Yesterday I happened to start looking through the messages I’ve been sending the other person over the past couple of months, and it was pretty stunning to see them all together like that.

There was a lot of anger and rage, depression, bargaining, and attempts to convince them of various things that I have no business getting involved with. I spent a lot of time and energy engaging in circular arguments, and letting myself get drawn into arguments that I normally would have avoided. I let what they were doing affect me a *lot*. I gave them a lot of space, rent free, in my head.

I’ve put a lot of time and energy into doing this. I’ve invested myself in someone else’s behavior in active addiction and their recovery at the expense of focusing on myself and my own self-care. It was unwelcome and entirely inappropriate. And also, it didn’t work, because that’s not how getting sober works. No one else can make it happen. And I know this. Intellectually, I know all of this. 

I had to think back over my other relationships with people who have addictions. I don’t have too many people who are active in their addictions in my life these days. I work with someone who is secretly drinking on the job. She’s only in a good mood when she’s drinking, and she gets a little loose and happy and sloppy. She’s functional enough, although I’m not the only person who has noticed - other people have mentioned it to me. 

It’s unpleasant to see, because it reminds me of a lot of my own drinking. I’d drink a bottle of wine (and later, a bottle or two) at night, and I’d be happy. I’d feel good. It seemed basically fine. It was killing me, but it seemed like the only way that I could get through my life. But I don’t feel any need to get involved with what she’s doing. If the opportunity presents itself to be of service to her, I’ll take it, but I don’t feel any inclination to intervene or involve myself inappropriately.

I’m active in AA. There have been a couple of people who I’ve gotten to know in there who I care about who have relapsed. It’s something that I’m sad about, but I’ve maintained pretty healthy boundaries around it. I’m available if anyone wants to talk, but I don’t try to force it.

My ex also had his own issues with substances, and it affected me. For a long time I didn’t call him out on what he was doing because I didn’t want him to call me out on what *I* was doing. Even after I started working on my own sobriety, I was able to keep myself focused on what I was doing and leave him to make his own decisions. 

In hindsight it seems a little weird, actually, that I was able to so easily maintain a boundary around his drinking. And maybe it’s an indication of where we were in our relationship that I didn’t care more and I didn’t want to get involved. But I honestly didn’t have any problems leaving him to do what he was going to do. If anything I was more understanding of his drunken episodes when I got active in my own recovery. I still hope for his sake that he gets sober eventually, but he seemed happy enough with what he was doing, and I didn’t feel any inclination to challenge it.

What’s different with this active alcoholic is that I’m bumping up against their choices and their behavior on a pretty regular basis. It’s affecting me in my daily life, but I’m also letting it affect me. They’re picking fights and provoking me, but I’m letting them draw me into it. I’m perpetuating the fights by fighting back. And it’s also someone who I care about who seems deeply unhappy in their addiction, and has made noises about getting sober before. I want them to get sober. I’m a little *too* invested in it.

So I hit bottom with my powerlessness over the situation yesterday. I realized that I need help. I went to an Al-Anon meeting. 
I’m in AA, so I know about Al-Anon, which is the sister program for the family and loved ones of alcoholics. I’ve even been to a couple of meetings before. Going to an Al-Anon meeting seemed like the obvious action to take.

I love AA. It took me a long time to get to this point. For several years of sporadic attendance I wasn’t massively into it, but I love being a part of AA now. It’s one of the bright spots of my life. I’m not particularly into Al-Anon. I didn’t particularly vibe on the meetings that I went to before, and I didn’t feel like I really needed the program. But clearly, I do. So I went. 

It was helpful. It didn’t fix or change anything, but I can see that it’s what I need, and I heard some helpful stuff. It’s a program that’s focused on taking responsibility for your own actions, it’s not about trying to get anyone else to change what they’re doing. I’ve been beating my head against that particular wall for a while now, so I’m ready to do something different. 

I’m ready to accept that I need to take responsibility for my own behavior and detach. And I’m ready to ask for help. I’m ready to admit that I haven’t been able to deal with this situation on my own, and that it is harming me to engage with it in the way that I’ve been engaging. If I change nothing, nothing will change. I learned that from quitting drinking.

So, I’m setting off on some new adventures in sobriety. Which is to say, I’m begrudgingly in another twelve step fellowship, I guess. I’m still sorta hoping that I won’t have to actually work a program in Al-Anon, that my AA program and going to some Al-Anon meetings will be sufficient. But, we’ll see. I have learned through experience that I only shortchange myself when I limit what I’m willing to do for my recovery.

At some point I still do want to get active in ACA (Adult Children Of Alcoholics And Dysfunctional Families), which is the twelve step fellowship that I identify with the most, but first things first. First I focused on my own sobriety, now I guess I gotta focus on my dysfunctional relationships with other alcoholics. When the time is right I’ll be able to get into my family of origin shit. I’ve got plenty of time for it - I understand now that recovery is a lifelong process, and getting sober is only the start of it.

Wishing you all well, thanks for being here with me!

I have popped out to the bar with friends this month and just had ginger beer and bitters. Went to events where everyone was pounding glasses of wine and whiskey; and kept myself clear.

I noticed that my body is still adjusting to the change. I sleep wonderfully— REM sleep is pretty wild, I am having very vivid dreams and waking up feeling refreshed after 8-9 hrs of sleeping. I didn’t even know that I was tired for years. Friends are noticing that I look refreshed and I also noticed that my skin is so much better. My eyes look great and clear, and I feel better about myself as well. I told my father that I quit drinking— I had previously held back on doing this because I felt that stating this publicly would make it real — and that I didn’t want to look like a failure if I started drinking again.

Overall - I have consumed more than my fair share of drinks over my life and it’s time to do something else. It’s really cool to find this forum with other likeminded people. I keep on going with the positivity expressed here as well.

I've gotten slack on going to meetings, went from everyday to only attended one this week. The first couple weeks the meetings definitely helped set me in the proper frame of mind about my alcoholism and drinking and gave me a reminder not to drink. 

However, I don't know that A.A. is the true path of sobriety for me, especially after talking with a friend whom did it on his own due to the same qualms with the program. At this point the cravings have gone from ""God dammit, I NEED a drink"" to ""Man, I would really love a cold beer right now."" 

I don't know that there is really a point to this post other than getting it off my chest because I have been thinking on it a lot. I almost feel guilty because there are a few nice people that always made sure to check in with me when they saw me, so I'm going to make an effort to go to a noon meeting in the next few days to say ""I'm still sober, just busy.""

2019-10-18 13:07:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/djqhef/struggling_with_things_out_of_my_control/,Struggling with things out of my control,"This bullshit feels like it’s going to drive me to drink, but I’m hoping by writing it out it may diminish how big the problem actually is, or at least be somewhat cathartic.

I dropped out of college, film school.  I had big dreams that were destroyed by my drinking and drove me deep into debt.  I tried going back for creative writing and dropped out again due to relapses.  Since I started out on this last bit of time I’ve put together I thought about what I actually wanted to do with my life.  When I was about 1 year sober I started working in a substance abuse program.  At 2 years sober I started taking classes for addictions counseling, realizing a new passion.  My counselor from the halfway house I graduated from advised me to take the program he had completed and got me started, seeking funding and registering for classes.  

I live in Massachusetts which has a program called Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission (MRC) which grants money to disabled persons and people with mental health diagnoses for vocational training and/or help in student aide.  It’s not much, a cap of about $3,500 for education when I started looking into it in 2016.  Which for the program I was applying for, they reduced their tuition for MRC students so that they could take the course in full.

In 2017, just when I started taking courses and had been approved for full tuition coverage for the program, the current presidential administration cut all funding for vocational training nationwide.  This left MRC with only state funding of about $1,000 per student per year.  Despite the horrendous impact this had on all recovering addicts and alcoholics having less access to education and vocational training, for myself it created a situation where my case manager made a call to submit my tuition in full to the college.  Usually classes are paid at the start of each class, not as one lump sum.  So this was a unique position for the billing department to be in.  They assigned all the money to classes I had registered for in the future, locking me in to a course load unlike the usual pay-as-you-go one class at a time method.  Because of the standard method, forms are filled out at the end of each class, students register for all classes they haven’t taken yet.  If they can’t make it to the class they are unregistered for that class and they pick it back up when they can.  However, I had been locked into courses, so when I was being advised to fill out these forms like everyone else, I was double registered and double billed.  This put a hold on my account and made it appear that I was not eligible to move forward in the program.  

I started with the emails and phone calls to resolve the issue, and it took about 5 months.  As that was all being squared away I noticed the first class I took, Psychopharmacology, which I had completed with a 100 on the final exam was not on my transcript.  There were also incompletes for classes I never took.  The program director stated I filled out the paperwork incorrectly.  I tried to inform him that I filled out all paperwork as advised *by him* but he refused to take any responsibility for these errors on my record and basically said “tough luck kid”.  I even sent him my correspondence with the instructor of Psychopharmacology that indicated my attendance and final grade, and the program director said, “You may have taken the class, but you were not registered.”  Meanwhile I’m being told by MRC that they sent the full tuition to the college, but somehow these funds were not being adhered to the classes I was actually taking.

I eventually got things straightened out enough where I could sign up for and complete my practicum.  After meeting with the instructor at the beginning of the last class he basically said he would fix it and everything was fine.  Last weekend I took the LADC exam and passed.  I was then instructed to collect signatures for my 6,000 hours in the field and send my transcript to the Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Bureau for Substance Addiction Services (BSAS).  When I went to retrieve my transcript I found my account was on hold once again and I had outstanding fees.

So now I’m back to square one, emailing these assholes back and forth who continue to refuse to take any of the blame, they keep passing the buck, telling me that it’s not their responsibility but someone else’s to solve it.  I keep hitting this brick wall and I’m ready to explode.

It’s this frustrating experience.  I keep thinking, at least when I was drinking and I wasn’t applying myself I knew who to blame.  Me.  Now when trying to do everything right, I’m still being treated like garbage.  And I’m pretty sure even when this is all straightened out once again, I’m going to get my transcript and find the issue with Psychopharmacology unresolved and incompletes on my transcript where there shouldn't be any.  

All this past week I've been asking myself, why am I even trying?

I'm 28M and For 3, 4 maybe 5 years now (I've lost track of time) I've been stopping by the liquor store after work everyday. Grab a 4 pack of tall boy craft beer, drink a couple on the drive and finish it playing video games or watching TV. Sometimes it turns into another trip to the liquor store for another 4 pack. This was the easiest way, in my mind, to not be obvious about my problem, because I could easily hide what I just bought from those I lived with. Tell em I'm grabbing some smokes and smuggle it back inside in my coat or whatever I could do to hide the beer I just bought. 

For a year or so it was with roommates who were starting to notice. Things change and I had nowhere and no time to find a place of my own so, now I'm back living at my parents place for a year or so now, and I've changed nothing. Its actually only gotten worse, with me downing a beer or two on the way to work.

It all seemed to start when my ex left me back in college. We were talking about marriage, I was gonna follow her down south where she was going to be going to med school. She wanted space and I didn't understand. I fell into depression, stopped caring about everything, school, bills, my own personal health, and hygiene. Drinking was how I escaped and it still is. Only now it's all catching up to me and I can no longer avoid it. 

I've been trying to rationalize this as not that bad. My dad was an alcoholic until I was around 11 yrs old, so he's my only comparison, and he would down at least a case a day. So I figure I'm not that bad so I must not have a problem. Well I'm just lying to myself and everyone around me. I have an addictive personality and I'm finally admitting it to myself. 

Today will be the first day of my sobriety. Hopefully not the last.

They lived in a really old house on a really old street with a really old, creaky playground and big giant trees. I always remember sitting out on the porch with my papa having tea and cookies. He had the warmest smile, the kindest words to say, and a great sense of humour. When I got a little older, ~15, I saw his wallet sitting out on the table and opened it up (because I was nosy, ok). A small, unfamiliar looking coin fell out. I asked him what it was and he laughed and said it was his 20 year badge. I was like, “badge for what?” And he told me he was an alcoholic for almost 30 years. I was floored. I only have the happiest, warmest memories of my papa. I never had an inkling that he had spent so many years as an addict. No one talked about it. He put it all behind him so that he could be present for his kids and his grand kids, and most of all himself!

Went the hair test route because it was 75ish dollars cheaper than a poly and needing whatever I can to uber around for now. 

Only fear of the hair follicle is it's still in the 90 day period of when I had drank, so hoping being alchol free in that period potentially could overshadow the drinks. Didnt really have much time to further spread it out as it seems they want to be in and out with this. I'm not nervous because of the alcohol as I've been sober, I'm only worried if it does come back positive it will be due to that period of time and theyll confuse that with the accusation of drinking. Thank god I got rid of my fucking old attorney and got a better,  cheaper one, which is code for I got ripped off lol. This court was not wanting to take hair follicle test as been abstinent from alcohol, but whatever magic my attorney used convince them otherwise. As long as I prove my continued AA and hair follicle test comes back negative, they will throw it out.

Advice?,"I feel guilty asking for assistance given I think I am a highly functioning alcoholic... and it is ""not that bad."" But for how long will it be not that bad? How high functioning am I really?

So some background before the question: 

Sober since Sunday night

Have done as much as a year with no drinking through jan 2018 - jan 2019

I moderated most of the last 10 months under 10 drinks a week. Then a nearly 30 hit recently due to work pressure. I tappered down and quit on Sunday 

It is my birthday today... lots of pressure and expectation

Question/details about the event:

There is an alcohol event at work where drinking is expected. If one does not drink it is said that it is okay... but it is not okay. And some have embarassed themselves by over drinking. A former colleague of mine has 10 years sober and we chat. They say they ""drink one"" by basically sipping on all of it all night then putting it down with more than half left. This person is the only person I have ever opened up to in person and felt they knew and they understood the pain. My SO does not struggle with this but they support me. Only one close friend knows that I trust who does not struggle with this. So there it is...

Do you all have other strategies I should be thinking of? My thoughts are to just skip the event and not think about it right now yet I do not want it and other events I skip to damage my career. I am doing my best here and want to learn from those with more experience on dealing with alcohol & work.

Update: I am skipping it. I am not ready right now. The temptation is too high. I want to go home and be with my family. Thank you everyone for your feedback.",2

My story doesn't look like the ""typical alcoholic"" if there is such a thing. In fact, people in my life would probably say my drinking isn't a problem.  But I want to stop and here's why:

Alcohol masks or complicates  my problems I don't really drink socially, even if I'm out with friends. I drink to feel less anxious, and to feel more comfortable around other people. Otherwise, I have this constant, nagging feeling that I'm somehow out of place. I can't relax. I imagine that people don't like me, even when I have no evidence that that's true. Even when I know they DO like me. These thoughts make it impossible to feel truly happy and connected. 

So I drink. On most days. A couple of beers or two large glasses of wine. Then I eat a little too much. And I end up in the same place: still anxious, disliking myself and never really dealing with the feelings that make me want a drink in the first place. I've tried rearranging everything on the outside: great career, partner, family, I'm physically fit. But no amount of money or reassurance from others makes a difference (duh!). I only feel more empty and confused. Why can't I enjoy this life?

So I'm starting today. I want to see if I can make it 24 hours, and then maybe 30 days. I might go to an AA meeting. Wondering if anyone can relate.",3

My dad ruined his life over alcohol, and I would just tell myself as long as I never got that bad and kept my drinking in check, I would be ok. 

Well, I am finally ready to admit that I am not ok. Due to medical issues, I was not able to work from February until just recently. With all that time on my hands and nothing to do, I started drinking more than normal. At first I thought it was no big deal. But then I started noticing as soon as I would wake up, I would plan my day around going to the store or liquor store. Then I started hiding the bottles around the house so my husband and roommates wouldn’t know how much I was drinking. It terrifies me realizing how easy it is for me to do this, and I don’t like who I am becoming. Those feelings just make me want to drink more. I don’t get black out drunk that often, but I do drink throughout the day when I can and have a buzz going. 

Today my husband and partner of 8 years told me he wanted to separate for a while. With me not working until recently, he was completely supporting the both of us and after a while I feel like I started to take advantage of it. (God, it kills me just to type those words.) He doesn’t want to be with someone who has no goals or future plans and basically just hangs out at home all day drinking. I don’t blame him, because I don’t even want to be that person myself. I want to be the partner and teammate that he needs and deserves. So here I am, back at my moms house with his wedding band on my thumb to encourage me, since he gave it back to me after our talk. And though my heart is broken, I’m hoping this is the ‘kick in the butt’ I need to get my life back on track. 

I am feeling more optimistic than I have all day after randomly stumbling across this sub in another thread. Knowing there are people struggling like I am but succeeding, and seeing how supportive everyone is, is very inspiring and giving me hope.

When sad. When stressed or angry. Just whenever. My husband was having issues with his health and I steadily became more and more responsible for his daily care. And then I drank. More and more. 

He went into the hospital on 7/29. They didn’t know what was wrong. He was in the hospital for 8 weeks. He lost 160 pounds (good thing), He was doing really well with physical therapy. He was excited. He was happy. They said he could come home in a few days...and then he died. 

Just gone. 

And the last three weeks have been a nightmare fog of alcohol. Just trying to drink enough not to feel but also at times praying it would just kill me and let me go be with him. 

Yesterday, I wanted to die. But I ate food, drank water and started taking Naltrexone  despite how I felt I just did it. And today....I feel 100% different! I reach for a drink by reflex and habit, but I really don’t feel like I NEED to drink.  it’s so amazing to have that chain lifted off me...

I have been wondering why.

I think what I have discovered for myself in this sub is a change of rhetoric. I find it very difficult to armour my subconscious against the very ubiquitous pro-alcohol message that is part of our culture in the UK; adverts for alcohol constantly instil the idea that drinking and socialising are mutually necessary; tv and film, books, songs, all peppered with images of drinking for fun, drinking to unwind, drinking to bond, drinking to grieve. It’s maddening for someone trying to quit, my addicted brain reaches out for anything that can be used as a justification to drink; pro alcohol propaganda is ready and waiting with that final push.

What I find here is an alternative thought space, a culture of not drinking. All of your stories, hopes and wishes, your successes, your musings about what new activities you might try this weekend; all of this information, this narrative, bombards my brain with another way. You all normalise not drinking for me in a way that I’ve not had access to before and it battens down the hatches against the terrible onslaught of “must drink, must drink”. 

So thank you for doing that. And for those posting about how to get over that hump, how to start? This. Come here. Read and read and read every single day, let you conscious and subconscious be bombarded with sober rhetoric. You will be empowered. Without even realising.",4

DATE: 2019-10-18

SUBJECT: Sobriety Market – Long Term Results

*Your life has not been drastically altered by our entry into the Sobriety market; as such, I believe it time to reassess our current commit to sobriety.*

*Please read the below statement (in my own words) and let me know if you have any questions.*

I’m writing to inform you that while on a day to day basis our lives have improved due to our entry into the Sobriety market, we have not seen the long-term benefits of this initiative. I would also argue that in addition to this unfortunate lack of return, it has also led to some sobering realizations that we as a team are reluctant to face.

We have not paid off our debts that we ignored for years, and whilst sobriety has forced us to acknowledge this, it has done little to rectify the situation. Furthermore, we have begun to take steps that for a normal person would improve their life, but because of the late entry into the sobriety market these steps have proven to be an unfortunate misstep.

We have overreached and while it initially seemed successful, it has unfortunately been negatively impacted by our delayed market entry. The reality is that with such a late entry, it will likely to take years to catch up to the early adapters, perhaps decades.

While I do acknowledge that some of these errors are mine, we must now work together on a solution, and I believe that solution is alcohol. With alcohol we can maintain our previous path of an early exit from Life, while minimizing exertion.

While you take a moment to reflect on my proposal please note that alcohol refreshments are available for your consumption at any time.

Sincerely,

Brain

I've only seen a scant few anecdotes on the internet, and if you try to search it you mostly find information about combining alcohol and bupropion (its bad for you). There doesn't seem to be any scientific studies on this effect - I'm guessing because bupropion lowers your risk for seizure and so is unsafe to give to someone who is physically dependent. Furthermore, since bupropion is prescribed to help with nicotine cessation, I wonder what proportion of people for which that has been successful also found that bupropion helps with alcoholism.

I happen to be in this boat, and I've really been counting my lucky stars lately as I've come to realize that this drug is literally saving my life. Bupropion was also how I quit smoking. It has no discernible side effects on me. It's a fucking miracle drug for me. The way it makes me feel is that alcohol feels like an abstract concept now, very similar to how I felt before I ever took my first drink, or when I try to imagine other drugs I've never tried. Since I quit, there's only been one occasion I even felt tempted to have a drink, but I wouldn't describe it as a craving at all. It just felt like an ordinary idea one might have when you're bored and trying to think of something to do (and I was bored at the time) that was easily put aside.  


Another interesting thing I noticed is that it worked from day 1. When you take it to quit smoking, the general advice is to set a quit date at least a few weeks after you start taking it, to give it time to fully get in your system. For me, I went from drinking a fifth a day, followed by a one day 10-beer ""taper"", and then I took bupropion the next day and it seemed to work instantly. This probably wasn't the smartest move due to the aforementioned seizure risk, but I was only displaying symptoms of physical withdrawal on a daily basis for a couple of weeks at this point.

Anyways, share your experiences with this drug and whether it did anything for you with respect to alcoholism.",6

I’m struggling, but here’s a bit of my story for those who may be interested:

I started drinking heavily when I was in my early 20s, and back then I assumed I’d just naturally level out after college. Then my brother, who was my best friend, died suddenly of an overdose due to a medical condition. And I spiraled downwards...hard. I went from a college drinker, to a nighttime alcoholic to numb the pain, and then years later I was drinking at any and all hours to just not feel the effects of DT and get through work. I’m sure people noticed but no one ever said anything. It was almost normal to me, though. My parents have always been very heavy drinkers,  and also spiraled after my brother passed. So it was like this little quarantined habitat of alcoholism that we all justified. 

Recently, I started noticing the effects on my health. I decided to quit, despite what’s going on around me. Using those who are also alcoholics around me no longer seems like an excuse to let my life go down the drain. I’m feeling better these last few days, but I don’t feel secure. I could fall back at any time and I’m trying so hard to hold my ground and not go back this time. 

I just needed to get this out there to someone, somewhere, who cares that I’m trying.",66

Not sure why but I feel like to heard a while back that its not healthy as you need to make a clean break. Replacing booze with a placebo almost keeps you with one foot in the ditch, so to speak.

However, I also just read a great book called “ The sober diaries” where the writer did drink non alcoholic beers at “special” occasions. She seemed to be fine with it and it gave her some comfort when surrounded with others drinking.

Wondering what the community feels about this subject: yes or no to non alcoholic drinks as part of a sober journey?",2

I like the numbers only because I have committed to writing a post every night and this way I can go back and read through my journey.

Had my first serious thought of drinking today. I was pondering an upcoming work event that I will be planning and I thought about the after party. The event will be in early 2020 and I thought, “maybe one night will be fine.” I seriously thought about it, then thought maybe I’ll just drink at this one event every year. Then I thought of how ridiculous it would be to drink once a year. Why bother? Besides, I wouldn’t stick to one night anyway.

Then I got home and ended up having a serious conversation with my spouse. We need to work on connecting more and I am a big part of why there are issues there. I am glad I am sober and I hope that I will start feeling mentally and physically better soon so that I am less tired and irritable. It is daunting imagining working through relationship problems, and basically being an adult, without a crutch. I have always had a crutch (addiction) of some kind in my relationships, with the exception of my first high school boyfriend. I am just piecing that together now. *sigh* More evidence that addiction has been a serious problem for me. Oh well, I am sober and I will be okay regardless of what happens.

I decided to put my thoughts out into the redditverse with the hope that it will help to keep me accountable and committed to making a major lifestyle change.

To make a long story short(ish): I \[26F\] have been misusing and abusing alcohol since about age 15. I don't remember ever having that ""little voice"" in my head that told me when it was time to stop drinking and head to bed. Whenever there was a party or an explicitly drinking event, I would go overboard and say/do things that I would regret the next day and end up praying that the earth would just swallow me right up rather than face my shame and guilt. This tendency has historically caused riffs in friendships and led to the downfall of some romantic relationships -- I have been more fortunate than I deserve having most people eventually forgive me for whatever cruel or embarrassing things I may have done or said. 

Fast forward to now: it is very typical for me to come home from work and have anywhere from 1-3 drinks on most weeknights. It is rare that I drink heavily before working the next morning, but it certainly has happened more times than I care to think about. On Fridays or Saturdays, I will usually attend or plan a drinking event and if nothing comes to fruition, I will simply drink heavily at home, doing literally nothing and a lot of times, by myself. It simply feels natural and justified to me to get bombed every weekend - feel guilt and shame for the next few days - rinse and repeat next week.

My current partner has voiced his concerns to me a number of times and has recently made it clear that if my behaviour continues, he will not stick around. This thought is devastating to me as we have known each other for over a decade and I considered myself the luckiest person in the world when I learned my feelings for him were reciprocated about 3 years ago. We have a wonderful life together and if I choose *alcohol(?!)* over this person, I don't know if I could wake up and face myself in a mirror every day. 

I suppose it is also important to note that I recently visited family members of mine that I hadn't seen in about a year and I was confronted with the awful long-term affects of letting alcoholism get a cold, unforgiving grip on you. I don't even recognize those people anymore and I'll be damned if anyone is ever able to reasonably say the same thing about me because of liquor. 

I do not expect myself to be perfect, but I am going to do my best to wake up and not drink with all of you one day at a time.",3

Smoking some weed here and there, getting some booze if we were able (we were 20). Then we were long distance so we only got drunk when I came home on weekends. Then the month before we both turned 21 (our birthdays are a week apart) we started stealing wine bottles from Walmart almost every night. We'd each steal a bottle and drink both bottles together. Recently, we started living together and we found ourselves drinking every single night. Not always getting drunk, but every night we could feasibly drink, we did. Now it's becoming the elephant in the room. We're both 21 and just trying to start our lives and we both have to fight the urge to buy liquor every day. We both want to have a healthier relationship with alcohol, learn to cut back and not need it to have a good time, but allow it occasionally. I have no idea how to curb this urge to drink other than just forcing myself not to drink or to set limits and I'm not sure that'd even work. There are days that I decide I won't drink and then by the evening I've found some excuse to go to the gas station and pick drinks up. We're doing better, drinking maybe 4/7 nights a week just depending, and not always getting drunk. Does anyone have some thoughts or insights? Anything at all would help, even knowing others have felt similar in any way. Thanks so much anyone for reading.",3

Feeling more settled in sobriety + running 5km a day,"It's getting much easier for me (although I avoid social drinking events, but more because they bore me than tempt me) and I'm feeling consistently good. I don't get urges by myself any more (even though I mostly use to drink alone).

I have committed to running 5km a day (not usually in one go - 2 or 3 runs depending on my daily routine) and I don't feel shattered - only sobriety has allowed this. It's only really recently I'm seeing a significant weight loss and able to actually build my fitness.

Every day I remind myself that I just can't go back to drinking (of course I *can* quite easily - but I can't face it - going through the days of pain, returning to the addiction, losing my calm state of mind etc).

My reasons for stopping (and staying stopped) have somehow naturally morphed into three that stand out above the rest:

1. Alcohol just wasn't working for me - it was no longer fun (it actually felt quite joyless towards the end) and was making me feel physically ill
2. It's actually dangerous - carcinogenic to all (or most) organs that it passes through, very bad for nearly everything else. Even on a cellular level it supposedly shortens your telomeres - it actually makes you age faster.
3. I just feel so much better without it, and the natural buzz of life is now better than anything alcohol could temporarily give me. There is a calmness, clarity and optimism that I just didn't experience as a drinker.

2019-10-17 20:49:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/djfnjx/took_a_different_path_to_sobriety_than_most_1/,Took a different path to sobriety than most - 1 year sober,"So I stumbled on this sub just today and thought maybe I could share my story.  My last drink was over a year ago, I don't know the exact day, not that I don't remember the drink, I just didn't mean to quit and never marked the date.  


My girlfriend of 6 + years had already made it clear to me that my drinking was no longer welcome in our relationship.  The reason she took this stance is because a year or so before I told her I would quit and asked her to hold me to it.  She did.  We had an unspoken agreement, I was not a drinker in her presence and I did not tell her about my drinking, but I would still tie on the odd bender.  Luckily we didn't yet live together and we always gave each other plenty of space and freedom.  The original date that I told her I would quit, she did as well, but she was never much of a drinker to start.  Everything changed in September of last year, she was pregnant and I was to become a father.


So, how bad was I?  I like to say I was never that bad.  Bad hangovers meant I never drank 2 days in a row and I very rarely drank through the week.  Tbh my desire to drank had been dwindling for a while.  But, like many of you have posted here, it was never a few drinks.  I couldn't even consider drinking if I didn't have at least 24 beers.  I was belligerent, rude, ugly and gross, while thinking I was a gift to the party.  I've had many, many incidents that I fucking wish I blacked out for because I'll never forget how dumb I was.  The worst part was I lost control every time... once drunk I spent money I didn't have, on things I normally wouldn't touch, like cocaine.  All of this is very tame compared to most, but I was an idiot plain and simple I embarrassed myself often.  


So, I just sort of stopped.  I decided my daughter wasn't going to meet that side of me, because if she did, she would lose respect for her dad.  I didn't talk to anyone about it, my family and friends didn't get it, a lot of them just assume it's temporary and really devalue my successes.  The one person who I could talk to had already gone through it, and to some degree believed I had as well.  So here I am a year later, the people closest to me are finally understanding that I actually don't drink, and still I don't believe they take it seriously (funny I've noticed the people who are most like me when drunk belittle my sobriety the most).

One of my big triggers when I was trying to get sober was the casual wine glasses in TV shows. I'm not even talking about party scenes or drunk scenes or anything like that. It wouldn't even be a focus or mentioned at all, the scene just shows characters dressed all cozy and sharing feelings with friends while gently cradeling a huge glass of red wine and taking what looked like the world's most soothing sips.


I wanted that peace. So I would immediately run to the store to get a 1.5 Sutter Home Sweet Red and a back up bottle just in case. Dumbass. It was always day 3. I always felt it was the mature and healthy thing to do. It seems so silly to be broken over something like that, but looking back I realized how hard it was to overcome. How even now I still romanticize that unacknowledged, background soothing wine everytime I see it.

I was happy to have drinking as an option again and I was committed to keeping it super minimalist.  Initially I sort of did?  I told myself that the year was going well.  That the drinking experiment was going well.  However, over the last couple months, there have been like 3 different instances where my drinking has gotten demonically out of hand and I've ended up with crushing anxiety-ridden hangovers for days.  I've driven drunk a couple times.  And even worse than that, yes I say worse, when I DO successfully drink in moderation I'm plagued by an anxious state hyper-vigilance the entire time.  Staring at my watch.  ""ok.... one more drink in t-minus 2 minutes and 32 seconds""  ""have I had too much?""  ""should I have one more??"".  It's just a fuckin drag.  My initial sober year was a dark pit of depression and anxiety.  I feel like it's gonna go much better this time.  I changed so much during that year and I've continued making progress throughout this year despite drinking, I think.  This time it feels less like a last ditch act of desperation and more like I'm just making the choice that is most likely to lead to the best life for me.  It was pretty exciting texting my old sober support network today.  During my initial year, I inspired a few people to quit, and they're all still going.  It's sweet to return to them.

I probably had bloodshot eyes, messy hair, stained clothes. I probably smelled like I hadn't showered in a week. There probably would be an open pizza box on the floor with a half eaten pizza in it. There probably would be an empty 2 liter bottle of soda on the floor. There probably would be some vomit and urine on the floor.  This was my reality and this is what happens to binge drinkers.

In 2017 I joined StopDrinking. It took me 2 years but finally I am 100 days sober and have no intention to return to that nasty lifestyle. I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. The emotional rollercoaster was just not worth it. I had noticed that just one night of drinking would ruin my sleep and emotions for WEEKS. 

I am 100 days sober. I sleep better, my mood is stable, my emotions are stable. I have more energy. I no longer post embarrassing nonsense on social media  and no longer send drunk texts. 

I go out for walks and try to spend time outside, close to nature. I watch movies and shows, play video games, read books, travel. I go to the mall, I hike, I swim. I am no longer a slave to a glass bottle. I am free.

In the beginning I allowed myself to indulge in a lot of cookies, ice cream, chips, fries, and pizza. Now that I have been sober for more than 3 months, I almost never touch that junk. I eat avocado, lettuce, apples, a bit of grilled fish or chicken. Why beat alcoholism only to replace it with diabetes or heart disease? Sobriety is my base, but I add to it clean eating, staying active, and meditating. 

Getting sober does not magically cure all problems. Instead, it is the beginning. It gives me the time and the wits to address my issues instead of delaying it forever. 
This is why eating mostly vegetables and avoiding processed foods and desserts really matters for me. My goal is to feel great and energetic and healthy. Sobriety is a big part of that journey but it's the start of better things to come, not the end goal for me.",124

As time elapsed though, and after joining Greek life, my use escalated and I was drinking beer and liquor. Mind you, I had no sense of what ABV meant, pacing myself, or the recommended daily limits for men. I ended up blacking out and being hospitalized on two occasions. My parents were devastated. I even tried keeping a slip of paper with the total of the medical bills on me, in a futile effort to dissuade myself from drinking in the future. It didn't work, though I never ended up hospitalized again. 

Between dropping out there and graduating where I did, four more years elapsed of irresponsible drinking. It wasn't as pronounced as before, because I was living with my parents at that time. But it was still doing stuff like getting drunk between classes, getting drunk at department parties with my classmates. Not being of age was no impediment, and once I did turn 21 stuff proceeded as before. 

(Looking back, it also occurs to me it was likely involved in the demise of my first, meaningful romantic relationship of one year. She was wonderful in many ways, and drinking as often as I did, I couldn't be there for her. Even that early, I was pounding back six-packs to play video games with The Crew regularly, rather than talking to her. She even told me she loved me once, and I was too drunk to respond appropriately!)

Between actually graduating, and landing my first full-time job - which took at least three more years - I've been leaning on heavier beers and liquor at bars, and increasingly at home. Its gotten to a point where buying 750ml bottles of whisky was a common thing, at least every 1-2 months, in addition to near-daily beer drinking after work, despite the impacts to my health and cognition. I can't really conceive of myself as a social or functional adult without beer. My digestion, ability to sleep, and focus/attention span are impacted by it in clear ways (had ADHD as a child, I suspect I still might have it). And, thanks to therapy, I'm becoming aware of the ways I'm using it to escape my inner life - my desire to have a social life, to begin dating, and my increasing desire to withdraw from people rather than work on improving/reinventing myself. 

That's about it, folks. Thanks for reading! IWNDWYT.",3

A glass of wine a day may be worse for your heart than binge drinking, research suggests.

Scientists from Korea University looked at the drinking habits of more than nine million people over eight years.

They found those who drank every day were 41% more likely to develop atrial fibrillation (AF).

AF occurs when abnormal electrical impulses cause the heart to beat irregularly and unusually fast. The common condition can lead to blood clots and raises the risk of stroke by four-to-five times.

Perhaps surprisingly, no link was found between binge drinking and AF, the results show.

Alcohol is known to affect sleep, with a lack of shut eye being associated with AF. The scientists warn drinking every day may cause the damaging effects of beer, wine and spirits to build up over time.

 “Our study suggests drinking less often may be important to protect against AF,” study author Dr Jong-Il Choi said.

“AF is a disease with multiple dreadful complications and significantly impaired quality of life. Preventing AF itself, rather than its complications, should be our first priority.

“Alcohol consumption is probably the most easily modifiable risk factor. To prevent new-onset AF, both the frequency and weekly amount of alcohol consumption should be reduced.”

AF is a common condition, with 1.2 million people being affected in the UK, Stroke Association statistics show.

In the US, up to 6.1 million are thought to have the condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

 AF occurs when the electrical impulses that ‘tell’ the heart to contract get out of sync, triggering palpitations.

Excessive alcohol consumption is a recognised risk factor, according to the British Heart Foundation.

Past research found the risk of AF increases by 8% for every drink consumed over a week. However, it was unclear whether the total amount of alcohol consumed or the number of drinking sessions was to blame.

To learn more, the Korean scientists looked at 9.7 million healthy adults. The participants took part in a nationwide health check-up in 2009, which included a questionnaire on their alcohol consumption.

In 2017, they were called back to check for signs of AF.  


[Results - published in the journal EP Europace - ](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-10/esoc-fdi101619.php)show those who drank every day were more likely to develop an irregular heart beat than those who only consumed alcohol twice over a week. No link was found between binge drinking and AF.

For every gram of alcohol drunk a week, the participants’ risk of “heart flutter” rose by 2%.

Compared to mild drinkers, those who consumed high amounts of wine, beer or spirits were 21.5% more at risk, the results show. Moderate consumption rose the odds by 7.7%. It is unclear how high or moderate drinking was defined.

In better news, the findings also show those who drank just once a week were 7% less likely to have AF than mild drinkers.

But mild drinkers were 8.6% less at risk than those who abstained from alcohol completely.

The protective effects of alcohol are controversial. When drunk in moderation, antioxidants in red wine have been shown to boost ‘good’ cholesterol. Too much, however, can weaken the heart’s muscle, preventing it from pumping effectively.

The results remained true even after the scientists accounted for the participants’ sex and age. AF becomes more common in old age, with most sufferers being over 65. Men are more likely to be affected than women, according to the NHS.

It is unclear exactly why this occurs, however, insomnia may be to blame.

“Repeated episodes of AF triggered by alcohol may lead to overt disease,” Dr Choi said. “In addition, drinking can provoke sleep disturbance which is a known risk factor for AF.”",4

You never prioritize dealing with your problem (let me guess, you haven't found a therapist yet). You looked like you were going to pass out in the restaurant (at 6pm I might add) and yet you got in the driver's seat of the car. I had to ask to drive. You sat in the passenger seat with the food that you forgot in the car and we had to throw away. Then you fell asleep 7:30pm without a word. I put her to bed and didn't even know where you had went until I checked and saw you passed out in the guest bedroom. There is so much wrong with this picture. I don't want to ruin our day being upset with each other but I have to say how I feel. This needs to change. I won't continue like this. Really. Done.""*

That was my daughter's 4th birthday, 2 years ago.

And now?

Our text messages are comprised of love notes and heart emojis. We're connected again. We almost never argue any longer. We desire each other and we yearn to spend time together because we're both present. It's not always perfect, but in a way it is because it's intentional and not because my brain was hijacked by a chemical.

I'll likely save this text message forever, so I can revisit it if I ever start to feel that itch again.

I wanted to go to the supermarket and get a healthy snack because I was starving but then I was too nervous that I would run into him in the healthy snack section so I ran to my car, drove through carls jr and wanted nothing on the menu so I got a diet coke and small fries and just cringed at my starvation and was sad to be feeding myself something unhealthy but I also did not want to take any chances lolol

This community was fundamental to those first treacherous weeks and for that I cannot thank *all* of you enough. I don’t drop in as often as my thought process is slowly but surely transitioning gradually from anxious thinking of alcohol or sobriety all of the time to just living in the moment, which is amazing. I am feeling inspired and blessed. 

To anyone struggling, considering, slipping, etc. Don’t give up, you really are worth it. Living in a society where alcohol plays a huge role in bonding, and not being able to partake is a loss to mourn but the realization that doing something that is physiologically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally toxic for me to fit in is senseless! It took me several attempts. I had heard that one time it will just stick, and it’s kind of amazing, that’s exactly how it worked. For me I think it was just a matter of acceptance that occasionally fun but overall alcoholic misery was getting in the way of my joy and success. I am not necessarily out of the woods yet as willpower fluctuates, but I resolve to try my hardest and cut things that threaten the state of my sobriety at will. Really I just want to be the best, highest, open, compassionate, active  version of me.

Exercise also has been my other rock. I believe/experienced that it has the power to regulate my emotional state. Therapy, surfing and trying to focus on mindfulness has also helped.

I’ve been sober for about 7.5 months, but still enjoy small bars, especially while traveling. However, up until a month ago I hadn’t been in my local dive bar since I quit. About a month ago I got off work at my normal time, but couldn’t go straight home, so I went to the bar for a Dr Pepper and basket of fries.Everything went well, the bartenders were happy to see me again, and were totally supportive about only drinking sodas. A friend should up so we caught up for awhile. 


When I left I had a unique experience. As I pushed the front door open I stumbled, and the continued to stumble the rest of the way to my car. It wasn’t the awkward stumble of a mis-step, but the stumble of being drunk. I think I’ve left that bar while drunk so many times that my subconscious just assumed I was drunk and made me walk like that. It was surreal. Once I was in my car I was fine.

I was like that with sobriety on the last go round.  I read “This Naked Mind,” and I was excited by the newness of sobriety, the newness of not waking up with a hangover every day, and the newness of not having to worry about what I did or said the night before.  Something changed though... At first, I thought it was “sobriety fatigue” but what I was feeling was persistent, and it was starting to scare me.  I didn’t want to go back to drinking.  I didn’t want to start all over again.  

On September 4th, I relapsed.  I got drunk one day, I got angry with myself, and I managed to abstain for a few days, but the cycle quickly restarted, and now I’m back to drinking daily, and heavily.  

Earlier today, the thought occurred to me that my last round of sobriety was just a fad.  It was a hobby.  An odd one, but still just a hobby.  And as with all of the other hobbies I’ve had in the past, it lasted about a month and a half, and then I lost interest. 

There is one hobby that I have that has been persistent throughout my life: writing, especially journalling.  I journal everyday.  It’s compulsory, and I feel terrible when I don’t write, even if it’s just missing one day. 

This is long, I know, but my point is that I should think about sobriety the same way that I think about writing.  It should be something that I do everyday because it defines me as a person, and it’s good for me.  Writing for me is therapeutic, and sobriety should be seen in the same light.  

TL;DR—Sobriety is not a hobby.  It should be as important to you as something you’re compelled to do on a daily basis.",12

Not sure what brought me there. Things are going great. Day was going great. Just sat there thinking why not.  Been a few years of relapses, hospital Er visits and IOP rehab. Haven’t drank since my 90 day back in May, drank one liter of fireball and that was it. I explain it as the demon kicked my ass SO hard so many times, I wanted to pick him up, enjoy drinking once more (spoiler, I didn’t enjoy it) and slam his ass on the ground. Now almost 6 months later cravings got me there.  

I pulled up the favorites album on my phone and saw all the reasons to drive away, which I did. Went home and ate way too much.  Slept well and now I’m on the phone with insurance arguing that refilling my antibuse will be much cheaper for them than another Er trip. I’m on naltrexone daily. 

Now that insurance gave ok, I gave to drive 45 minutes to the only rite aid nearby that actually has the pills on hand. I was able to find one pill from last year and took it.  On my way to get it now.  Find the courage, focus on the ones who love you.  It’s not worth it. I Did Not Drink With You Last Night. IWNDWYT.

You told me we had unfix-able issues one of which being my inability to quit drinking for good and my hiding and lying about it.  You told me you didn't think you could ever take me back because you no longer trust my word on things.  I had problems with you too that I'd communicated and weren't being fixed and I know it wasn't all just me that lead to this, but you're not wrong in this specifically.  You cut off all contact with me and I haven't heard from you since.

I am heartbroken that I lost someone as great as you in my life, but this was the wake up call I needed to make me absolutely hate alcohol and realize I need to finally do this both for myself and so it won't affect future relationships.  I went to my first AA meeting because of this.  I finally got a therapist after years of saying I would and putting it off because of this.  I'm back at the gym and eating healthy and trying to be the me that I'd lost in the time I was with you.  In the long run, I know I'd rather lose you and finally quit this horrible addiction I've carried for years rather than stay with you and continue drinking myself to death.

I just wish I'd made this realization before I lost you.  I miss you every single day even though it's getting easier to accept you're gone.  I am respecting your decision and not reaching out to you.  I want this to be a catalyst for change.  If one day you decide to reach back out you will see I've fixed my problems now with actions rather than words, if not I hope we both become our best selves and can find people who love us as much as we loved each other.

I miss you, I love you, thank you for giving me the gift of making me realize why my sobriety and my health are so important.",30
2019-10-17 11:41:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dj85q7/im_back_again/,"I'm back, again.","One year ago, I was 15 months sober. I got lost. I fell, FAST, into old habits. I put off stopping because of ""that bachelor party in July"" and ""the cruise that's coming up in August"" and ""the two weddings in September""... All of those were really just reasons for me to ignore stopping again. And I knew it. 

10 days ago I got drunk on a Sunday night for no reason and passed out in bed. I made it to work, and got a text from my husband later that morning saying that I need to stop, he missed when I was sober, he won't be drinking anymore at home, and he will sleep on the couch if I choose to drink (that's the short version anyway). He wasn't mad, just concerned. I'm really grateful for that. It was tough to read and accept, but it was necessary. I actually logged on here and read through all my old posts. I reminisced about how great my sober year was. I decided immediately to stop again. I feel really hopeful, finally. Even excited. Energized!

I've been a lot more open with my husband about my struggle this time. He's gone for a month for work, and before he left he gave me a card and wrote how proud he is of me, and that he still loves me. I needed that, too. And last night, he texted me asking what I was doing, and a few minutes later I told him I just got out of my first AA meeting. 

I have a lot of experience with quitting drinking, but one thing I never did was connect with other people about it (except for this subreddit). My sobriety and alcoholism was a huge secret. I've been listening to a podcast called Recovery Elevator (highly recommended) and in one of the first episodes he talks about the importance of connecting with other people for accountability. So I decided to try it. Turns out one of my neighbors was leading the meeting. He gave me his number and we agreed to go again on Sunday morning. 

Hopefully this is the last time I need to write one of these ""I'm back!"" posts! IWNDWYT!

I look back on active alcoholism now ( it's been quite a few 24's ), and it seems very much like a prison for my mind.  Something that I could vaguely feel was there, but I didn't know how to escape.

There's a green filter on the movie every time the cast is in the matrix.  It's a visual cue that the circumstances have changed.  You could put an alcoholic filter on my life from about age 19 to 36.  It was the prism from how I viewed the world.  I really only thought about the next time I would drink or get high.  When I did any substance, I did copious amounts.  It moved from what I ""did,"" to how I ""thought.""  I reasoned from an alcoholic mindset.  I rationalized based on what an alcoholic would do.

Occasionally I meet people in the rooms and they think that, ""everyone drinks.""  At the moment they're talking to me, they imagine the rest of the world is in some form of a liquor commercial, at a bar hanging out with their friends, wearing fancy clothes, surrounded by attractive members of the opposite sex, having the time of their lives.  They're so far down the rabbit hole, they've applied their condition to everything and everyone.  It doesn't help that us substance abusers tend to flock together.  Squares are no fun to be around, so people in active alcoholism hang out with others people that drink.  This reinforces the impression that this is ""the way things are.""  People in the Matrix don't know they're in the matrix, they have to contact people on the outside to find the escape routes.

I rarely think about drinking these days, except when I'm helping other alcoholics.  If it wasn't for these times, I'm sure I would go weeks, maybe months, without the concept even crossing my mind.  I'm never compelled to go back from whence I came.  Once you've seen the truth of the world, the illusion of alcoholism is no longer compelling.  Early sobriety is hard, but every day it gets easier.  


When Neo is first on the Nebuchadnezzar, he says to Morpheus, ""I can't go back, can I?""  Morpheus responds, ""No.  But if you could, would you really want to?""  I never want to go back.  I love sobriety.  I only wish I had realized the truth earlier.",33

2019-10-17 10:35:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dj795s/birthday_binge_to_end_them_all/,Birthday binge to end them all,"It was my birthday last Saturday. We also turned it into a surprise marriage celebration (Got hitched last Wednesday). I drank a lot - maybe 15-20 drinks over 7 hours? I wasn't blackout drunk. I didn't embarrass myself. I remember going to bed around 1am and saying to my husband ""I thought I would be drunker than this"". 


3 hours later it started. The vomiting. The anxiety, escalating into terror that I was drinking alcoholically again. Yes, again. I felt my toes scrape rock bottom. I swore I didn't want to be that person again. Not for the first time this time round I thought that it might be time to pull the pin on drinking for good.


I have previously clocked up nearly a decade of sobriety. For the most part my return to drinking hasn't been what I was told it would be - picking up where I left off, etc etc. I've been drinking again for 4 years. I even work in the wine industry now and I'm really good at my job. I don't drink every day, not even close. 95% of my drinking is contained to 1 glass of wine or 1 beer, or less. That other 5% though - it's problematic. 


Blackouts, inappropriate and offensive comments, making a fool out of myself, selfishness, self centred behaviour, bed wetting. And the hangovers, oh the hangovers. The hangovers that dragged my sorry ass into AA for the first time in 2006, are back with a vengeance. Hours and hours of puking. Eating junk food and taking benzos to cope. Being checked out from parenting. Lying to my kid why mummy feels sick. Ongoing gastro problems. 


Writing this down is important for me. It's easy to forget the horror when the hangover has subsided. I'm 5 days sober and the thought of having a drink today is not there. The thought of never drinking again terrifies me. I don't want to be ""that"" person. The boring sober one. I know what sobriety looks and feels like. I lived it for a decade and I don't know if I want that again.",3

Been in a weird head space the past week or so (horrible viral illness didn't help) so getting this down helped a lot:

In light of World Mental Health Day last week, an update from the slight madness I posted a few months back for any of you that care.

26 weeks. Half a year. 50% through one orbit of the sun. I'll give this sobriety lark a solid 5/7 so far.

I still can't sleep properly and have no fucking idea what I'm doing most days or in any social engagement, although I am slowly learning to recognise and inhabit a more full emotional range, as well as approach and unpack personal issues that have been buried for a long time. I'm committed to open, 100% honest communication and spend considerably less time contemplating the futility of existence. And the sex is definitely better.

Now I'm beginning to accept rather than fight that I'll always have issues with depression, anxiety, impulse control etc. That's just how I'm wired. They won't go away but they can be mitigated with mindfulness, activity and genuine human connection. Drinking (and recovering from) alcohol fuels the long-ingrained synaptic links in my brain that spiral intrusive thoughts and moods into a much more destructive place and essentially, it has no net positive effect on my life when taken in any amount.

Was/Am I an addict? Perhaps. It depends on your definition. The 'alcoholic' question has long rattled around my brain, even since my teens. Yet I understand that it's a hugely loaded word meaning vastly different things to different people. And just because you didn't see me on a park bench with a can of black label every morning, doesn't mean I wasn't there every now and again when shit hit the fan.

I certainly became an habitual (if not quite long-term daily) heavy binge user, whose consumption was fueled by an impaired and eventually compulsive decision-making process rooted in the reward structures of natural human brain development, which led, on many occasions, to terrible life choices. I also lied, hid and made secretive my true consumption levels from even those closest to me. Anyone can fall into the trap; our incredible brains sadly make it all too easy for this to happen, but some of us are more susceptible than others or start down the road much earlier. So I'm happy with 'A' word, even if I maybe don't fit most people's concept of it.

All that said I'm no puritan abolitionist. You want some beers or a few lines? Have at it. And I've no issue meeting you in the pub to go out or heading to a gig with booze everywhere. I just hope you stay mindful. Me? I'm alright for the time being; just trying to keep my head as clear as possible and carve a modicum of sense out of the crazy I see and feel every day. That might take a while longer. None of us have it easy. And my door's generally open to anyone else having a rough time (call ahead first though please)

Background:
Starting drinking as a binge drinker in college 2006, then a weekend drinker for a number if years. About three years ago started having a couple beers after work during the week. It snuck up on my and I was drinking daily 8-10 beers a night. 

I realized I had an issue about a year ago but didn't want to admit it. Long story short the straw that broke the camel's back was the beginning of August. I did 6 sober days and wanted to unwind on the weekend. Friday night had 3 beers and stopped...but Saturday had 6 then sunday 12....I realized I can't drink casually...always leads me going on a bender. Choose to stop 10 days ago and I keep telling myself 1 will not be 1. I want to be better for my self and my kids.

Physical Update.
-Lost 4lbs
-No more waking up hungover
-No more shitting 4x a day
-Still feeling exhausted , but not the same way
-Face is swollen anymore 

Mental update.
-performing way better at work
-not feeling depressed/ashamed every morning
-spending more quality time with my kids
-dedicating more time to my hobbies,which I was neglecting while drinking

This has been great for me, but challenging. Today is probably the first day in 10 days I feel happy and hopeful. I've still got other issues to work through but I'm feeling more confident and stronger. I'm working on baby steps...next big milestone is 30 days..which will be the longest over gone without drinking since 2006.

To everyone here, awesome support board. I love reading your stories and knowing other people are fighting the same battle is motivating.

My inability to handle stress without alcohol spiralled in this last year. Booze intake really jumped, to where I was getting loser drunk 3 times a week. After getting kicked out of the house, I winded up with a DUI. No license until Dec. 2020. Court order keeps me from contacting the ex and the kids until Sept. 2020.
Something's gotta give.
The worst part is that I'm alone all the time now. That's been playing hell to my frame of mind. But I'm trying to stay positive.

Also- shout out to NA beers. I had previously made a post saying that I didn’t like them, but they have been a godsend for me. Sometimes I just missed the taste of beer and the feeling of having a “grown up” drink. I am lucky enough to live in a city with a brewery that has 3 different craft NA beers so I can still drink enjoy a beer with friends without the awful side effects.

I knew I was close to the cabin but didn't know which way I needed to go so I just started walking then turned around and went a different direction and ended up on someone's property and explained where I needed to go and that I didn't have a cell phone to call my husband. So did they have a phone I could borrow to call him. They didn't have a phone because it was in the middle of nowhere and there was no signal. The property owner said he knew where the town was that the cabin was in so we started driving. We drove for about an hour and he said he couldn't get me all the way there. He dropped me off at the side of the road and showed me a map of where we were. We had gone waaaay out of the way of where the cabin was. I saw a group of ladies and asked the same about the phone and they didn't have one for the same reason. I started sobbing and explained the situation and showed them the map. One lady was kind enough to take me so we drove and drove until I saw a Pizza Hut that looked familiar and I thought I knew which way to go. As it turned out it wasn't the right way so we turned around and went another direction. She then said she couldn't take me any further. We looked at the map and we figured out where I got the first ride. If I had just gone a short distance in the opposite direction, there was a road that took me right by the cabin...a much shorter and direct route...

Then I woke up and had a panic attack. Sweaty, clammy light headed...I've been having a lot mini ones a lot lately.

Holy shit how the mind works...As I type this out I can really see better what my mind and my body are telling me. I do know where I need to go and I do know the direct route. Maybe this time I can get there.",12

I've been an addict for ten years - weed and alcohol. I'd smoke weed everyday, all day, and if I didn't have weed, I'd drink. I've been off weed for 6 weeks, but the last 3 weeks I've been drinking daily - 5-10 beers a night. I prefer alcohol to weed, as weed is too psychoactive and messes with my head with paranoid thinking and anxiety. But alcohol just relaxes me, it shuts everything off, it numbs my brain.

I often use work as an excuse to drink - ""oh i've had a hard days work so I can drink a few and relax"". But I can never stop once I start, I need more and more and it's never enough, I realize I cannot limit myself, if left to my own devices I'll drink until I blackout. So after speaking with my psychiatrist, we've decided it's best for me to enter an inpatient rehab program. The longest I've ever gone without a drink is 3 weeks. In rehab, I'll be there for about 4 weeks and then exit and start the drug antabuse, aswell as attending the outpatient rehab programs. I don't even really know the point of this post, I'm just looking for some kind of advice or encouragement? The marijuana addiction subreddit /r/leaves has been so helpful to me in getting off marijuana, but now I've just exchanged one drug for another. I really just want to live a sober life, without abusing any substances and constantly looking for an escape.",20

The more I go without booze, the more I want sugary crap. I know it’s a mind over matter thing, because I cut it out of my diet awhile ago. The problem was allowing myself that one piece of cake, or those 20 mini chocolate bars. Kind of like alcohol when you think of it. I can’t just have one and forget about it. 

Honestly though, training my mind to give up the junk food is much easier than it was with the booze. Now, I couldn’t even give a shit about having a drink of alcohol. It is not appealing to me.

I work as a bartender and server so I’m surrounded by drinking culture. My doctor put me on a stomach acid blocker (for chronic heartburn) in February of this year. Tried to not drink while I was on the medication, but couldn’t stop. After two refills of the medication, I thought, “I’m going to be on this drug for the rest of my life.” Decided with all my conviction to stop drinking for good. My beautiful fiancée and I both quit on September 16th and have been rewarded with improved mood, skin, health, time management, and finances. We both quit marijuana today as well and will support each other through the grumpiness of quitting THC. Christmas Day will be our 100 days sober from alcohol and 70 days sober from weed. This community helps me keep everything in focus and I am grateful for that. I know that I’m an alcoholic and having one drink will be the beginning of the end...again.

For the first time in a long time, I decided I was going to 'cool off' and go a day sober. I've had some pretty heavy cravings since that decision, but it felt manageable enough.
That changed a few hours ago. 

It started with some nausea, then shaking, and soon enough I was covered in sweat with my head in the toilet-I've only gotten up from there to get water for the sake of hydration.
This has felt worse than any hangover I've had in years.

I've never seriously considered stopping entirely but I don't want to shrug this experience off and jump back on the bottle tomorrow-I want this to be my first day of sobriety.


Ive always been too nervous to post or comment on reddit, but I know that putting all of this into a community of people that know what I'm going through is a better place than any for me to start.

Edit: I wasn't able to sleep due to the nausea, but I had a lot of time to reflect on how I got to this point and what I can do to stay away from being here ever again.
I got a sobriety checking app and wrote down my reasons to quit and it felt really good. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this post and I hope we all stay strong.",9

I am 38 years old, I have autism and live on a little disability check. I am trying to be really positive. I figure its normal to tell ones larger story that lead into the addiction on their birthday, but I do not really want to, it depresses me. When I got onto Reddit I did dump my entire life story, most of it anyway, on here 18 months ago, this is that if anyone is interested.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/8mjyx5/this_is_my_story_trigger_warning/

The addiction part is fairly simple though. I never drank irresponsibly overall that was just because I did not drink too often, 1, 2 and never more than 3 times a month. I did that until I was 32. I also did not use hard drugs often, until 32 as well I had a rule I did not buy them. I came from poor people, so free drugs were not common, once every 6 months or so on average. I did anything besides opiates when they were free though, which frightened me. Then at 32 a long term friendship ended badly, the stuff from childhood came up, and I began drinking until passing out every day for 4 years.

I will spare people the normal story of how that went, I was always kind and determined not to be abusive, but I was an increasingly sad, venty person who was hard to be around, and I wrecked all my relationships, some 10 and 20 years, slowly over those 4 years. People did not have any better tools than me is the issue, they kept saying drinking was a legitimate solution and then did not know what to do when I grew worse and worse, I was always so passive and kind, ghosting was all they felt they could do in the end. I get it.

Then I jumped off a bridge, no matter what my internal feelings I had never done anything before, that is what got me into therapy and recovery. I got help from an addiction counselor, a trauma therapist, a general social worker, a mental health drop in center, and on Reddit, that was my program. I did harm reduction for 1 year, and am now sober for 1 year. I cannot express how grateful I am to the people who have helped me. I am actually feeling quite down or depressed, and do not know if that is normal on a sobriety birthday.

My people and family and such are not the most pulled together. But well half are in active addiction or so the other half are in recovery at this point, my mother has 6 years and a sister 4 years, but they do not think of things like that, so not a friend or family member remembered, not a person has phoned, and there will be no real celebration. The social worker will take me to lunch in a couple days, which is incredibly kind of him. Just feeling a bit down is all. This is really a positive and happy thing, in any larger sense I am really happy. I have trouble giving myself credit, but this is a good thing. Anyway I just thought I would share, thank you so much to anyone who reads this.",172

Every week, month, year of sobriety is bringing you closer to major scientific breakthroughs- and usually greater accessibility to many good possibilities.

Maybe where things stand now, either you can’t repair the damage done to your body by drinking or it’s unaffordable. But there is a constant stream of medical research and changes that could mean that it is practical to fix it in 5,10,20 years. The less relapses you have between now and then (hopefully none!), the better the chances the “impossible” could happen.

With sustained sobriety, your liver may be fixable one day. Or the neurological damage.

Or you could dodge the dementia you would have had because major interventions become available. Because you stopped and bought Your brain an extra 5 years of time before it’s onset.

Maybe drinking would’ve pushed you over the edge to diabetes bad enough that you’d lose a limb but instead it’s manageable by a next generation treatment.

Maybe you’re depressed or anxious and have been drinking to cope. The time you delay relapse each time could bring you to a future where antidepressants are radically better with less side effects. Or are totally obsolete because something we haven’t even imagined could “cure” these things.

I had a great time, had a lot of laughs, and I don't have to worry tomorrow about whether I got too loud or embarrassed myself. Some of my coworkers were stumbling back to the hotel but I feel great and clear headed. This is pretty pathetic, but this might be the first time in a decade that I turned down drinking in a social situation when it wasn't required (like pregnancy)... and I still had a blast! I still can't even believe I held my resolve and said no to the alcohol. This feels like such a tiny but huge moment.",134

I’ve always liked drinking because of my severe social anxiety, but the dam broke once I turned 21. I had some pretty traumatic things happen to me nearly two years ago too, and that was the final nail in the coffin. I’ve wasted so much money on alcohol, done countless things that I’m embarrassed of, upset those around me, and gained nearly 50 pounds. I was arrested for a PI and spent the night in jail, but that still didn’t stop me. I failed my last semester at school, but that didn’t stop me either. I took one off, promised myself I’d quit drinking and went back. But guess what, I didn’t stop drinking, and now I’m failing this one too. I’m ruining my life, but part of me doesn’t care because I’m depressed and suicidal. This isn’t the life I want for myself, but I feel so out of control at this point. Like I’m sitting in the passenger seat with someone unrecognizable driving the car. For years I’ve been working on a bachelors degree that I don’t even want because it’s what my family expects. I wanted to go to mortuary school, but that wasn’t good enough. 

The worst part is, no one other than my roommate and a select few close friends know what I’m going through. My family has no idea and I wouldn’t know where to begin with telling them. I’m absolutely terrified of disappointing them, but deep down I know they’d rather me be alive than miserable or worse dead. I have to make some changes, but I feel so overwhelmed at the thought of if all. I found a new full time job that I start soon, and last night was my first night sober in months. I have appointment with a counselor coming up, and I’m going to try to get a medical withdrawal from school. I’ve never liked therapy in the past, but I know I won’t be getting better unless I’m honest about everything with someone. 

I barely slept and I’ve felt shaky and nauseous all day and I’m so tempted just to go and get a few tall boys. I’m sorry for how rambly this is, I’ve lurked around here for awhile but I’ve been reluctant to post anything myself.",12

Not drinking has become second nature, but I still romanticize it as the memories of how alcohol wreaked havoc in my life get dimmer.  I don’t crave drinking itself, really, but I have nostalgia for good times that we’re probably not due to drinking but alcohol was there.

Sobriety has laid out some of my issues very clearly, but I can’t say that I’ve been able to deal with them.  Anxiety and depression are prominent in my life and I still wish I had a magic button or pill to deal with them.  I know booze isn’t it, but the quick buzz and mental change that it causes is attractive.  I play the tape forward, though and I know it isn’t a solution.

My boyfriend is fantastic and beautiful and every good thing in the world. I decided to quit drinking about two weeks ago. Went through the first week strong and determined and didn't drink...Until Saturday I was happy having soda waters at home and we had a party to go to that night I had told him I wasn't going to be drinking. He felt like a drink so I said well go and get yourself something and I'll get ready for the party. 

He came home with beers for himself and a 'just incase' bottle of wine for me. I was kind of annoyed but anyway I saw his beer and thought ahh fuck it I'll have one. Had the first and was like I guess I'm drinking tonight. 

The 'just incase' wine was consumed. I regretted drinking etc etc and back here I came. 

Lastnight we spoke about quitting smoking and I said I love the idea of quitting together but realistically right now as you know I am focussing on quitting alcohol so I think I'll give that a month and then try quit the smoking.

He said he thought it was silly that I felt the need to put extreme limits on myself and suggested I only drink on Saturdays, I said I don't want to be hungover every Sunday. He said well just have two or three glasses (lololololololol lets all laugh at that one together because we know we cant)

I told him I know that I cant have two or three glasses and I know that it will just slip into the same habit again and that I don't want to touch it. If I know I can't stop Id rather not start. I've wasted too much time being hungover or drunk.

I then pointed at the long line of alcoholics in my family then he replied ""well if you see yourself as a person who can't stop at one you'll always feel that way, why not try and train yourself""

Is there any way that I can get him to realise that I'm giving up drinking because I simply don't want to drink and I am scared that he will buy me a 'just incase' bottle of wine this Saturday and if that happens I will probably get pretty fucking angry. Last weekend, sure it was my fault and I am the one that drank but if you have someone holding a gun to your head and yelling at you constantly to pull the trigger, how long does it last before you cave in and shoot yourself?


Anyway long long ramble but I am serious about this, I know with time he will be fine with my non drinking (I was sober for the first 6 months of our relationship) I'm just worried if he is subconsciously trying to sabotage me and if this will ever stop?


Any advice would be so appreciated - don't tell me to break up with him though please. Thanks",2

new to this Sub. I am over a year now that i haven't even had a beer. I always drank the hard and didn't usually stop until puking. I was blessed enough to not go through heavy withdrawals when i quit because it was my second trip around but not my daily trip yet. I am clean and never had my life more organized. I am a hard working father, provider to my 3 young sons, keep busy with them and life constantly so i don't get down or unmotivated. I have become a person who has to have plans with the family every weekend and always on the move during and after work to not be ""Bored"" I have come a long way but to this day i still have times that i just want an Ice Cold Beer yet i always preferred the hard stuff i think to myself that i always enjoyed the occasional Blue Moon. i know i cant and wont but it is still a mindset i need to have and don't cave to it. so that's a little about me i some how make it through all this with the story to follow.

&#x200B;

3.5 years now my Wife and life partner is still struggling and i just don't think i ever got this far that i can truly understand how it is for her. This will be her first Sober house and 8th detox/rehab. By the way anyone reading this it is not the cost of rehab that matters at all i have the debt of my wife and it ranges from a $3000-80,000 stay and as ""Fancy"" as the more expensive one is its more of a hotel in ones mind. No matter where or what the person depending on any substance has to decide not the center they go to. today is day 15 for my wife and she is still in the sober house so its not mandatory but i have told her she has nowhere to live if she leaves. I have told her whether this is right or wrong i am at my whits end and for once i am giving up on her. This is it i will be Divorcing and taking full custody of the kids if i have to bring our sons down this road again, that includes my own Sanity. It is so hard watching someone ruin there life and killing their body. I want to help more than she will ever know but i cant she has to decide that. I hope she has but after so many attempts it becomes the boy who cried wolf. I am at a loss and don't know what to say at all there is so much more to the story and so many other things to say but unless you are the addict you truly cannot get someone else to snap out of it. They must decide on their own. i just want her to stick with it because living on my own working full time and trying to provide for my sons is so very hard and unwanted. There is the question of when is it to much and when your the last person to care or help you dont ever want to give up. I am fighting for her this last time but i guess the point is when it starts to affect your own mentality and your Kids if you have at some point enough is enough. Its so incredibly hard to watch someone slowly destroy their life and kill themselves physically but it is also a toll on the family members effected that still care and give it all the effort they can. 

&#x200B;

This is more of a rant than anything but there is always hope what may work for one person may not for the other. No one can say when you are Done with your substance use but they also cannot decide when to give up either one day it just happens.

It preaches the opposite of what helped me get and stay sober,"TLDR version: I worked really hard to sober up and lose over 100 pounds over this past year plus. Even confronted my closeted homosexuality and came out so it couldn't control me or drive me to drink. I just went to my first AA and hated it. It replaces dependence on alcohol with dependence on meetings/the group. What helped sober me up was personal accountability. How do you all feel?


So I'm a long time reader, dont post much here. Been browsing this sub since before I made an account. Reading almost a year now. Never made a thread, but I have replied to few posts that really spoke to me and I thought I had a worthwhile contribution to the conversation. 

Just a little backstory so you can understand where I'm coming from. From age 19 through 32 I've been a hardcore alcoholic. It started out just to party and have fun, but over a year it also turned into self medication and slowly the drinking for fun stopped altogether, just drinking to fill that black void inside. I'd sobered up about three times, but never more than several months. I'd always slip back into thinking I could moderate myself, but it would just slip out of control when life seemed to pile on me.

About 2 years ago I had enough with my empty and directionless life. I started to explore spirituality and Christ, finding good motivation. I started to try and care more about life, but I still drank through my search for betterment. Then I was struck at work with the fact that somehow 2 hours into my shift I was STILL drunk from the night before, I had driven drunk unknowingly and was at work intoxicated. I HAD to change my life. I swore to pour out my booze and just never drink again. If I never had another drink, I could never slip off the slope, so to speak. That night I poured the little remainder of my gin handle and then late night/early morning started heavy withdrawals. I finally gave in and drank a tiny bit of my roommates whiskey just to feel functional, and then humbled myself to buy more booze for the sole purpose of tapering down.


Over 3 weeks I went down from more than half a handle of gin a night to 3 MGDs a night and then nothing. The whole time just drinking enough to not feel like death, but never to get drunk. Man that was hard. Especially with as tapering down and then sobering up, my roommate (also a hardcore drunk) is just trying to get me to start drinking again. All of a sudden, the guy who would never share a drop is pouring and trying to hand me shots. I ignored it, I powered through. I was motivated to live a good life, body, mind and soul. After a couple months he got the picture and stopped pushing it on me, if only because I would harp on him sobering up too.

I quite drinking some time in late July, early August of 2018. I haven't had a drop since. I've also started watching what I eat greatly and trying to exercise cardio daily. In early 2018 when I started my quest for betterment I weighed 380 pounds. As of today, I'm 269 pounds.

This past July I was triggered for the first time with an overwhelming powerful urge to drink. I thought I had a handle of thing, but I didn't. I've been closeted and in great denial about my homosexuality my whole life. My literal biggest fear was someone finding out I was secretly gay, even though it was irrational (the people I know wouldn't care a bit). It was so bad that a time in my mid 20s I had a heart attack and instead of calling for help, I spent that time/energy wiping my computer so when dead no one found gay porn lol that bad. And I realized that no matter how I lived life, this would always hang over me and I could never be fully in control.

So instead of going out and buying gin, I decided I would own this. I've never before in my life loved myself and I'd finally gotten there. I wasn't going to let this control me and ruin my progress. I faced my biggest fear and came out publicly as gay. I'm still dealing with internal struggles and learning to be okay and comfortable with my sexuality, but I'm owning this so that it cant hang over my head any longer. That was when I made this reddit account, to make threads and ask gay questions/try to learn and be okay with gay stuff. So I've been out of the closet literally as old as this profile is.

I've dealt with my sobering up by myself, other than reading this sub for reminders of why its important to stay sober. But after coming out as gay, I wanted to meet and talk to other gays to share stories/experiences and make friends. But everything for meet ups are at bars. But wait...an LGBT AA meeting on the callander! They're gay AND dont drink, a double whammy for making friends with a commonality 

So a few weeks ago I went to my first AA meeting. I hated it. People 20 years sober still calling themselves alcoholics. People calling themselves powerless. No accountability for their own actions. It's a system made to keep you in a state of dependence, if not from alcohol then the group itself. It flies in the face of everything I did to help myself. I dont drink anymore, I haven't in well over a year and have no intentions to. I am not an alcoholic, I used to be. 

Now I am sober and accountable for myself. I worked hard to get where I am. These people I see are so sad, not thinking they can do things themselves and that their addiction controls them and it's not their fault. You need to hold yourself accountable for your own life, even the parts you dont control.

Did anyone go to AA and feel as I do? Am I alone in this? I've gone to 3 meetings so far. I told myself I'd go to 10 no matter what, so I'm still going. But I dont really like the people there, I just pity them. And the program just reeks to me of it's own dependence.",74

This is hard.  In some ways this feels harder now than it did at the one week mark.  Had a family party this weekend and I felt totally out of my skin most of the time due to not having my old social crutch.  I've been handling it by drinking craft sodas and juices.

Also been struggling with major mood swings and just a general 'blah' feeling.  One minute I'm perfectly happy, but 30 minutes later I'm in a spiral of depression.  The last couple weeks have definitely reinforced that the 'pink cloud' stage is surely over.  I guess the real hard work is learning to live life sober, no matter how imperfect it is.

I know in the long run this is the right decision, but the low points make it that much harder.  Sobriety truly is a journey...sometimes I'm just not prepared for where that journey is taking me.

Sometimes there is so much beauty in this world, I don't even know what to do with it...

I’m feeling really lost. I can’t keep drinking and yet I can’t stop drinking. The depression is killing me, or it literally almost did. My meds are being fucked up by it so my psych just keeps throwing them at me. I’m so against taking drugs too, but I keep ingesting legal and highly addictive alcohol. Jesus. 

My weight is off my usual charts. I have a few valid reasons why but mostly it’s extra booze calories. This makes my body image and dysmorphia a thousand times worse. I know if I dump the drink some pounds will melt off. But no, I keep drinking. 

Plus I have a surgery coming up that a) would be better served if I dumped some weight and b) I can’t be drinking before, around, or after. Which is concerning because I can barely get a day sober lately.  

It’s not a lack of willpower. I just don’t care. I wake up and feel shitty and think that sobriety might be good for me. But give it a few hours and I’m in fuck it mode already. 

I’m so lonely. I got divorced a few years ago, right around this time of year, so emotionally I’m in a shit space too. I’m working two jobs so I work everyday so I can stay solvent. I know less money on booze would make a huge difference there too. But I’m constantly stressed. See above on the depression that’s crushing me. 

When I drink I just don’t have any gumption or will to go on with any aspect of my life. I want to learn some new things, but balk at the price. Even when I’m spending hundreds a month on booze. I was trying to get into CrossFit but my negative self critical mind is telling me I can’t or won’t or don’t belong. 

Thanks for listening to my rant. As always, suggestions or advice are welcome.",4
2019-10-16 13:10:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/disdc7/notice_the_normal/,Notice the Normal.,"Recently, my allergies have been giving me trouble. Love the transition to Fall, but damn my allergies love to kick in to high gear. While I was taking medicine and feeling like garbage, I couldn't wait to feel back to normal again. I finally got my allergies back under control, and started to feel good. That was like a week ago. And as I was driving to work today, I really realized I was back to normal again, but for the most part, I didn't really think anything of it. I didn't notice the normal. And I think that is one thing I struggled with when I wanted to stop drinking. I took the normal for granted. I never really noticed the normal, or embraced it. It was like I wanted to feel normal, but still also drink. Which just couldn't happen. I would be drinking, and notice too late that I would be drunk, and would be slurring my words, or not making no sense with what I was saying. And I would be thinking to myself, I wish I would be feeling normal right now, so I wouldn't sound like an idiot. Or when I would be hungover, I would be laying in bed just miserable, just wanting to feel normal again. Except, when I would be back to normal after drinking, I didn't really notice it. Again, I would take it for granted, and want to start drinking again. Because I didn't realize how good normal felt until it wasn't there. But now, I am trying my best to consciously notice what normal feels like. How good it feels. How normal is better than drunk or hungover. Where I can be the best version of me. I won't take normal for granted anymore.

Notice the normal and embrace it.",6

I hid behind the screen of my phone and admitted that my fiancé and I abused each other, and that alcohol was the source of our problems. I admitted that we were both violent drunks, that we needed help, that we had no idea how to even begin.

79 days ago, we stopped drinking. We made doctor's appointments. We promised to support each other. We put both the bottle and our fists down.

Today, we're both taking our meds. It's been 79 days since we hurt each other. It's been 79 days since we drank. It's been 79 days of us growing stronger. Today, he has a cold, and I'm having a rough day at work. Today is beautiful because we're alive to have colds and bad days at work.

Tonight, when I get home, we'll both drink hot mugs of tea instead of whiskey, and talk about our days. We'll go to bed early, and in the morning, we'll wake up without hangovers.

I've lurked for a while here and there, reading the posts and stories from all of you. What's different this time around is I figured I would sign up and give this a shot. 

I've had a relationship with alcohol I considered unhealthy for some time now, at least two years. Several nights of drinking in excess, but mostly confining myself to a room with beer and/our whisky, avoiding my problems and trying to drown whatever is inside of me long enough to have ""fun"". I've tried quitting about a month back, and that lasted about three weeks. 

And, honestly, I don't know what is different this time. Or what will be. I just know I'm tired of having a throat that feels like crap, low energy, and generally not feeling like I'm in control of my life. I'm also dreading the vacations I have coming up, the work-related happy hours, and damn near anything else that could coax me back in.

On July 25th, I wrecked my truck and got a DUI in the process.  I've now been sober for 82 days.  This is my longest stretch of sobriety since I first started drinking over 15 years ago.  Over the last few years I've attempted to stop drinking multiple times with little to no success.  What seems to be different this time is the fact that I've accepted who I am (an alcoholic) and I'm now openly talking about my problems.  I talk with folks in AA, with my sponsor, with my therapist, and with my wife.  I no longer feel like I'm fighting this impossible battle alone.

&#x200B;

I still have bad days, in fact, yesterday and today are examples of bad days.  But now that I'm sober, I have the capability to face those bad days with a clear head rather than getting blackout drunk to forget that I'm having a bad day, only to wake up with the same problems and then some.  What I didn't realize was how much work it takes to stay sober, but you know what, I also did a shitload of work to hide my drinking from everyone, trying to prove that I didn't have a problem with alcohol.  At least the work I'm putting in now to stay sober has a purpose and a positive direction.

I would take breaks here or there. But was typically drinking every night, 2 or 3 days during the day for work functions, and all weekend. I had stupid rules, like I would never keep hard liquor in the house, and only drank beer/wine on weeknights. This some how helped me justify things. 

I lived for the weekends. Started as soon as I got home Friday, did not stop until Sunday night. Rinse/Repeat. Never felt physical withdrawals, barely ever got hung over. I made a point to *always* get up for commitments.  I always got up for work, and played golf regularly (which also involved heavy drinking) - which no matter how late I was up for the night before- I always made it. I thought this meant I had it under control, and all was good.

Two weekends ago, I had dinner plans Saturday night with my SO's boss and wife. ( I knew about this for weeks).. I went all night Friday- 3 hours sleep-  Got up early for golf- kept going. Got home at 3pm from golf- took a shower and thought I was good to go. He rented a Limo to take us to the city, to one of the nicest steakhouses... and.. basically I remember none of it. Don't remember conversations, what I ordered, what I ate, what the place looked like.. nothing.  I remember getting home- only to go back out again with buddies. I received the following text that night from SO, "" I have never been more embarrassed, or felt my more disrespected in my entire life""

I apologized profusely, I am( or at least I think I am ) pretty good at being on ""auto-pilot"" and I apparently wasn't *that* bad- which is probably why she is still my SO. I thought about it, and realized I am constantly apologizing for things I say/do while drinking, and decided to make an effort to stop. It has been... 11 days, and bored as fuck..",6

That all changed last week. I co-host a podcast about bisexuality and this week we discussed mental health among the bisexual community. Surprisingly (to me), bisexual women have a higher rate of binge drinking than straight and lesbian women. I was super unsure if I was going to share my experience as a bisexual woman who struggled with binge drinking and ultimately chose sobriety.

I've definitely gotten comfortable with the constant imposter syndrome of doing a podcast about sexuality (am I queer enough? why would anyone care what I think? this is just personal, not research so it's garbage),  but it was super weird to feel that way about my sobriety! I was like -- was my drinking ""problematic enough"" to even talk about? why would anyone care what my experience was like? Ultimately, I decided to go for it, hoping that some people who are struggling might look at their drinking and know it doesn't have to be the way it's been.

Anyway, it was super nerve-wracking to do but I feel proud but also bashful and a little silly. Just wanted to share.",19

Somehow, writing out the consequences out like that still shocked me, despite the fact that I've already been living with them for a few days now. Scarier still is that I can write that out, and in an incredible way, come the witching hour, still think to myself, ""Well, my problem isn't that bad."" Oof. 

Even if I think the no-no juice will somehow give me the motivational powers to fix everything, I'm reminding myself that's a lie. I can't even clean my apartment while drinking!

                 (P.T.S.D.)

Does he feel the crosshairs 
upon him still? 
An invitation to fire at will.
Modern life a bitter pill?
Stuck in the throat,
like a silent scream.
A nightmare end 
to the childhood dream. 

I watch the fella, 
from a distance. 
The all too familiar, 
shambolic gait. 
He studies the floor, 
stooped & downcast. 
His trembling hands, 
stuffed deep, 
into a well worn Barbour jacket,
with it's greasy, moleskin pockets.

Clearly once big & proud, 
he's now trying to shrink. 
Wants desperately to be ignored.
But - 
he needs another draft, 
of the bitter bile of vile regret.
 
Only the 'offy' 
will help him forget. 
Only in the dark, 
with the curtains tight, 
as he chokes back, 
his thinly promised oblivion,
can he turn another 
unwelcome day, 
into that queesy dream. 
Of the long gone velvet night.
Re-live the fight, 
push away the fright, 
turn up the volume
on the screaming emptiness, 
of his lonely home made hell.

Walking down the hall to piss. (uniformed young men, in frames on the wall seem to mock him). 
He catches sight 
of the stranger in the mirror 
& halts. 
Staring...
into the blood shot, 
weary, 
too old eyes. 
The mask disappears, 
no more disguise. 
He grips the frame, 
in despair. 
He gulps for air 
and starts to quietly cry...
dropping slowly to the floor, 
to curl up fetal 
& wait for the end.

Eventually, 
he dreams 
& sees bloodied bayonets, 
as far as the eye can see. 
A broken child, 
he charges onto the points - gleefully! 
Feeling no pain, he howls..
in the ecstasy of victory 
& release, 
blood pounding the temples, 
he's free at last.
Free! 
Scorched & purged, 
in the fire 
of sacrificial redemption.
Delighted. 
Smothering the grenade, 
that childhood tossed his way. 
Soak up the explosion 
& be the sacrifice, 
be the lamb, 
be the fattened offering 
for the prodigals..

..'till morning 
when - surrounded - 
by empty tins & bottles 
(arranged in all round defence)
He rises with an anguished sigh.
& with trembling hands, 
once more, 
he unlocks the door 
& steps over the start line...
Once more into the breach. 
His tortured mind, 
responding, 
like Pavlov's soldier, 
to a faintly heard 
& distant bugle call.

Pale blue eyes, 
watered with old 
& new tears. 
Squinting, 
into the cold, 
relentless, 
winter sunlight.
Treading that familiar, 
well worn path.
To the door, 
of promised oblivion. 
Again.

A mumbled, 
fumbled exchange. 
Purchase made. 
He exits.
He shuffles home. 
Forgotten & alone.

I've been hiding alcohol so that I can make my drinks in the morning. Without sipping on a drink throughout the day it doesn't take long for me to start to feel the withdrawals. This weekend was bad. Me and my SO drank a lot, she never gets any of the withdrawal symptoms. 

So Monday I missed work because it would have been clear to anybody who knows what to look for that I was an alcoholic going through withdrawals. I drank just enough to hold back the shakes and sweating, trying to taper off. But I was confused like I've never felt before. Like groggy and uncoordinated. Then that night at like 9pm as I was trying to sleep, I started having mild hallucinations... It was bad, I took a couple swigs of my hidden drink, took .5mg of Xanax and was able to get back to sleep through the night. If I didn't do that, I think I would have been heading to the ER.

So yesterday was Tuesday. Same story, I can't go to work because I'm shaky and super anxious. No possible way that I can sit through any sort of meeting in-person, so I work from home as much as I can. I barely drink (this equates to probably 6 shots throughout the day) I have one ""weak drink"" (probably 2-3 shots) over a period between 7-9pm hoping that will ease me enough to make it through the night. I fall asleep fine. At 3:30am I'm a mess. I can tell blood pressure is through the roof, sweating, etc. I take a .5mg Xanax and hope that will help. It does for about an hour. I start researching for Detox programs nearby that take my insurance. I've made a few inquiries and I think that I'm actually going to go this time. I just made a small drink and feel much better... At some point I need to put some serious time under my belt, what I'm doing now just means the inevitable is going to be much worse. I don't want to die or have any serious health issues. I'm 35 and have a 3 year-old boy who is perfect and I love so much. I feel like such a POS.",3

Relapse after 10 years.,"My wife and I built an incredible bar in a borderline 3rd world country in South America.  Prior to this venture, we lived in NYC and I had been 10 years sober.  We arrived 4 years ago, looking to switch up our life and explore something new.  I had sold my previous business, an event production, and we decided we wanted to travel and live outside of the U.S., originally, I didn't want to go. I was fine with our lives, I was comfortable, I was happy.  But my wife wasn't.  She was a stay at home mom, raising 2 kids, and it was getting to her.  So, I agreed to this new venture, to make her happy.

Upon our arrival here, all was fine, but we didn't know what we wanted to do.  We were living off the sale of our production business (which I grew very quickly, in a very saturated market in NYC, and we had clients like Nike, Gucci, and even former president Obama - life was good).  But we both struggled in trying to find a life for us here.  During that struggle, I relapsed after 10 years.  My wife didn't know me during my drunk years, she met as I was tapering off, so to her, she always knew me as a regular / non-drinking person.  At any social event, I had NO problem saying no.  Never had the urge.  Never relapsed.  My wife also always told me, it was ok if I wanted to have a beer every now and then.  That she trusted me.  Big NO-NO to say to an addict.  But I made it for 10 years, without the slightest temptation or desire to drink.  Then one summer day, swimming, and having a good time with my kids at a family function... it happened.  My cousin passed me a nice cold beer.  I didn't hesitate for one moment and I drank it.  And so it began.

Fast forward 3 years later, we now own a Craft Beer gastropub in a country where the minimum wage is $385/mo.  Average salary here is $600/mo.  We made it in one of the most economically challenged & politically unstable countries in South America.  Our clients are on the higher end... Lawyers, politicians, financial types, and other expats where income is of no concern here.  We built another successful business in a short amount of time, and we both hate it.

We don't hate the business.  We hate what the business has done to me.... Fueled my addiction.  3 years now, I've been struggling again with my issue.  She now knows the drunken side of me.  The countless binge drinking marathons.  The coming home @ 9am completely drunk and still wanting more.  She now knows WHY I had to stop before.    Why it was a problem.  Once I start, I can't stop.  But because she is who she is and why I fell in love with her, she blames herself.  She thinks because we moved here and because she took us away from our comfortable lives and she gave me the 'ok' to have a beer every now and again, that it's all her fault. 

We are heavily invested in this business, it has taken just about all of our savings, and we don't even have enough to get back to the states.  We are looking to sell, but it's been difficult.  We've also taken investments (friends and family) to grow the business (we've doubled in size every year since we started), and that requires additional capital.  Friends and family gladly invested, because they trust me (I have a knack for creating successful businesses).  But now, all that is at risk, because of my relapse.  I go thru my dry spells, sometimes 5 days, sometimes 10 days.  But I always fail.  My longest bout has been 15 days, which ended yesterday.  My wife is on the verge of a nervous breakdown, because she can't take it anymore.  My kids... so innocent, so sweet, are also being affected.  AA doesn't work for me.  I tried it before, and I didn't like it.  It actually made me drink even more.  Before, I just had enough and stopped and 10 years passed.

But now, I don't know HOW to stop.  We both agree we have to get out of this business.  My wife has been covering my shifts, to keep the temptation away, but every time I have to work (she's tired, staff calls in sick, busy event), I find a reason to have a beer.  And that beer leads to a 12 hour binge.  I'm fine when I'm not at work.  At home, I have ZERO desire to drink.  No urge, no withdrawal, nothing.  Life is normal.  But when I walk into that bar... That's it.  My wife has been working 6 days a week there, stays late to close up, and she comes home exhausted.  We are a super busy place, and running around for 8 hours takes it toll.  Anyone who works in a busy restaurant, understands.  The day before I decided to cover for her, because she was having problems with her knee.  I went in @ 12 noon, I closed up @ 1am, and I didn't come home till 11am yesterday.

Enough already.",8

He was diagnosed with stage 4 bladder cancer a few months ago, and today he'll go in to get the result of other cancer tests. If it's in his lungs (and how could it not be?) then he's terminal.

I've never had a good relationship with him as he was a violent alcoholic who was mostly absent from my life. He has loads of family, but has isolated himself in a crummy, little apartment where he can drink in peace. He's still my dad though, and now he just seems like a sad, broken old man who wasted his life. He never figured it out, and I don't think he's ever actually been happy or content with his life, and it all seems like such a waste.

My mom is miserably drinking herself to death in my sister's basement - another wasted life.

Seeing how his life is going to end makes me all the more committed to keeping alcohol out of my life. It took me years to battle through the demons of my childhood and get safely sober. My life is so nice and peaceful now, so rich and varied in way it never could have been as a drinker.

I wonder how people in this community dealt with similar issues?

Thank you for not drinking with me today.

It's quite sad but maybe it will help someone to realise they are not alone. It's called ""An alcoholic enters the gates of heaven""


```
What kind of man I was to be you’ve known since the beginning,
since the beginning of every creature.

It must be horrible to be aware, simultaneously,
of what is, what was,
and what will be.

I began my life confident and happy,
certain that the Sun rose every day for me
and that flowers opened for me every morning.
I ran all day in an enchanted garden.

Not suspecting that you had picked me from the Book of Genes
for another experiment altogether.
As if there were not proof enough
that free will is useless against destiny.

Under your amused glance I suffered
like a caterpillar impaled on the spike of a blackthorn.
The terror of the world opened itself to me.

Could I have avoided escape into illusion?
Into a liquor which stopped the chattering of teeth
and melted the burning ball in my breast
and made me think I could live like others?

I realized I was wandering from hope to hope
and I asked you, All Knowing, why you torture me.
Is it a trial like Job’s, so that I call faith a phantom
and say: You are not, nor do your verdicts exist,
and the earth is ruled by accident?

Who can contemplate
simultaneous, a-billion-times-multiplied pain?

It seems to me that people who cannot believe in you
deserve your praise.

But perhaps because you were overwhelmed by pity,
you descended to the earth
to experience the condition of mortal creatures.

Bore the pain of crucifixion for a sin, but committed by whom?

I pray to you, for I do not know how not to pray.

Because my heart desires you,
though I do not believe you would cure me.

And so it must be, that those who suffer will continue to suffer,
praising your name.

Advice would be appreciated,"I could go into all the reasons why I started drinking. It started with people telling me I was more fun to be around. I was social, extroverted, I made more friends and slept with more girls. This began my senior year of high school, 11 years ago. 

By the time I was 21, it was over for me. I was in college and working as a bartender while full time in college. I fell down a hole of drugs and partying only to be interrupted by school and maintains my grades. The balance was fragile, but I graduated with a high GPA and two degrees. Right out of college, I thought I was special. The job market disagreed, so I went to full time bartending. 

Alcohol became my life. I was drinking before work, during work, and after work. It wasn’t long before I lost my job. I wish this was my wake up call but it wasn’t. For a while a floated around the country, couch surfing with the money I made. The bar I worked at was upscale so I had about 20k in the bank, spent it all. Once I ran out, decided to move back home with some friends. Quickly found another bartending job while I tried to do something with my degree. 

During this time I was drinking pretty much nonstop with other drugs. This lead to my first injury. I was so fucked up I shattered my shoulder. It had to be completely reconstructed. In my mind, this was time to quit drugs... excluding alcohol. 

It was some time before I received a job offer. I think I was 26, great opportunity with an amazing company. At the time I was elated and quit drinking entirely for the first time. I went an entire year, until my sister passed away in a car accident. My sister was the only person I’d ever told and been honest with. She was the reason I was clean. Once she was gone I lost it. Right back into old habits but much worse. 

I’ve been everything from everyone I care about. People think I’m okay, but I’m not. About eight months ago I had a seizure at my dealers place. After that, I tried to quit and did great without the hard drugs but kept on drinking. More recently I dabbled again with a relapse, this time I tried to quit everything at once. I’ve never hated anyone more than myself and spent most of the night crying alone. 

The next day I decided to sober up. I told myself I was done putting myself through everything. My body was in terrible shape, another seizure. This time I fell down a flight of stairs and my roommate took me the hospital. My mom showed up and I stayed with me while I was recovering. I lied to her face, I lied about everything and she believes me. I even stole alcohol while I was living with her recovering. 

My mom eventually found out. She went to my home and saw my closet, it might as well have been an empty distillery. I don’t know if she’ll ever trust me again, and I don’t know if I can ever trust me again. She is begging me to tell the truth now that I’m home. She wants to help me so desperately. I don’t even want to help me. After all of this, all I want is another bottle. 

The worst part of it all, I drank heavily after a month sober. It felt good because I could finally shut my mind off. I want to want to quit so badly. I need this more than anything. It isn’t the first time I’ve written my thoughts out, but it’s the first time I’ve done so publicly. Hopefully this will be sobriety day two. 

I don’t know want do anymore and I’m losing my mind. All I have left is my job. I don’t know how to rebuild myself. Fuck, my only hobby is drinking until a sleep. 

Any direction out of this hellhole is a good one.",3

I knew I would fail because of the trip's itinerary, so I didn't beat myself up. I was able to stop drinking for much of the time before I left.

Now that I am back, my resolve to quit drinking and maintain a healthy lifestyle has strengthened. And, future trips won't be centered around drinking. Most of the people on the trip could sip the wine and savor the flavor, For me, it was sip, guzzle and buy a bottle (or two) for later. And do it again each day.

Occasionally I feel great moments of joy - 10/10. 

Alcohol left me generally feeling 1-4 out of 10 in the mornings (i.e. shit to very shit) - and the evening boost caused by drinking more alcohol was never as good as I built it up in my mind - with hindsight it was only really a maximum of 6 or 7 (maybe it used to be higher when I was younger/healthier - more able to process the booze, but that's a long way behind now). Writing down how I felt when I was actually drinking (and giving it a /10 score) helped a lot - it's really not that good, and towards the end it seemed to just feel joyless.

It's not always easy, but it's always worth pushing through (which in itself becomes easy).
But the uneasy moments come fewer and further apart. Life is just better, easier, calmer, enhanced, and often optimistic/inspiring (something that gets lost when I drink).

I work in wine, so it’s always felt like a big stretch to stop drinking entirely - heavy drinking is so normalized in the biz and expected for networking. Plus obviously, I do enjoy good wine.

I hopped on board Sober October as a trial run, but gave myself two cheat days for events I’d already had planned. 

Last night was one of them - a dinner out with some friends/work contacts. We drank some wine, probably more than most would drink on a weeknight but not as heavy as I often see at these sorts of things. 

Sure it was fun, but the difference this morning is like night and day. My skin has been clear and soft and today is flaky and red. My eyes aren’t as bright. My energy levels are low, where I’d been really smashing it at work lately because I’ve been so energetic and clear-headed. I love not drinking.

I don’t even want to take my second cheat day - a movie night with some friends. Our movie nights have been rather boozy affairs in the past, but I think I’ll just take some NA beers and fixings for mocktails. 

And I guess after October, I’ll have to figure out a way to keep drinking at networking events to a minimum- at least I’m not in sales! I wouldn’t mind continuing to have a glass of wine with dinner on the weekend with my SO, but I’m ready to be done with the heavy nights of drinking.",3

From a physical perspective I feel amazing. I can drive without anxiety (used to have panic attacks while driving due to the shakiness I'd feel from starting to go into withdrawals after being in the office for 8 hours sober and hitting the 12-14 hour accompanying shakes). I don't get weird out of body experiences like I used to. I'm sleeping better (with some aid from melatonin), and it's been great waking up in the morning and not feeling like I might need to rush to the bathroom at any moment to fend off some dry heaves.

That said, the social aspect this week has been HARD. 

I've been at a sales conference all week and the drinking culture in this environment has been absolutely insane.

For one, spending time in airports and traveling is hard. This week I knew I was taking a Lyft to my hotel from the airport, and I could've easily had a few drinks on the plane, probably for free, or grabbed a bottle of wine on my first night to hang out in my hotel and eat and drink. No one would've known and it was tempting, but that turned out to be the easy part.

At dinner with some co-workers a few nights ago, I had to listen to a more experienced sales associate go on a tirade about how important it is to drink at these kinds of events. In his words, you ""don't want to be the person who's had the most to drink, but you need to walk the line because you can't do these things sober.""

...

*Sips my La Croix like it's the goddamn TEA*

Every dinner has been filled with offers of free booze. I asked the hotel manager if the outdoor pool that's still open was heated the other night (while I'm getting my body back to a shape where I can do normal exercise, swimming laps is one of the most manageable forms of exercise for me). His response? ""I'm not sure... Just have a few glasses of wine first, you won't know the difference!"" Uh, thanks buddy.

Tonight was our big dinner; several rounds of appetizers for a room full of tables and straight out the gate everyone was ordering cocktails. I ordered an NA beer so I could cheers and fit in, which worked pretty well for me, but immediately the entire conversation turned to alcohol preferences. Two weeks ago I'd have jumped into my preference for vodka and gin, but as I kept turning to different conversations, all of them were the same. One person likes a glass of wine every night before bed. The next took his gin with a bit of fruit juice, but preferred it straight. Even turning to our hosts, the conversation was about all of the types of whiskey he'd tried at the last event he attended.

I'm trying to be professional and play the part. I took a huge pay raise for this job and genuinely love the work so far, so it's not all bad. I can see a real future and career here, but I hate feeling like I have to play into some stereotype of boozy schmoozing to fit the part. I just want to wake up sober and do the best I can, but it's so frustrating to feel like drinking culture is an integral part of the job. Getting scoffed at when I ordered a seltzer with lime instead of ""another beer"" (that no one even realized was NA anyway) was just the icing on the alcohol drenched cake tonight.

Tldr; I needed to vent because sales culture sucks when you're trying to stay dry and be a better version of yourself so you can do better at the job at hand. I've been annoyed with friends in the past when trying to figure out myself and get sober, but I've never seen it be so difficult or seen as a negative in the workplace quite like this. Either way, thanks for letting me rant and I still won't drink with you tonight.",3

Earlier this year he discovered much of this.  I told myself during all those years what I did that he didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him and didn’t affect me.  I drank to lose myself, to feel a rush.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone! Just a few minutes ago, I noticed something kind of cool. My three cows and my goats all had moved to the gate I use in the evenings. They do this around the same time every night and if I'm late, they'll yell at me. My birds knew it was about time for supper so they started making noise (I assume I dared to move too slowly).

It's cool because a few months ago, they weren't this organized. But since I've quit drinking, they *know* that I will be there around the same time. That tells me I'm settling into a healthy and responsible routine and I really dig that! I bet you've noticed something that proves how much you've changed, too. So whatever it is, I'm proud of you for it! IWNDWYT!",82

If I don’t do enough and therefore don’t start feeling better (with other health issues), I will want to hit the fuck it button and drink. It’s a fine line.

The latter is so peaceful and inspiring. I have a huge painting of one that I bought in Thailand at the end of a retreat there where I really did some serious healing. I also have a medium sized brass statue of one that is now in my reading/meditation nook.  Both of these images depict the Buddha as being calm and peaceful and poised. 

My painting also has some funky imagery in the background which hints at the inner world which can be discovered through meditation but to be honest also looks like something you would see on LSD.

The statue is the seated Buddha with legs crossed in a traditional pose with the one hand in the lap and the other in one of the configurations (mulas?) which is supposed to be grounding. It certainly looks grounding and is so inspiring - it just makes you feel peaceful. The slight smile on the lips is something I feel when I meditate regularly and I love it so much.

I don’t why I got thinking about the laughing Buddha and how different it looks. I wonder where it comes from. Should probably research it. It could not be more of a contrast to the other image and I hope I’m not being disrespectful here when I say it reminds me of myself when I am “the life of the party”. Visibly effusive and jolly. I can see why some people prefer that side of me but I can also see how it can be interpreted as being frivolous.


Anyway, I was just a metaphor that has been on my mind. 

I hope everyone is having a lovely morning/afternoon/night and letting their inner Buddha shine strong.

2019-10-15 19:30:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dighhh/drank_like_a_fish_for_five_years_started_having/,Drank like a fish for five years. Started having strange abdominal pains last week. Finally time to be honest with my doctor and with myself.,"30 year old dude here.  I started drinking casually in college, but never really went overboard.  Around 2014 after I had been out for a few years, I started drinking to deal with my constant boredom and depression.  It didn't really help, but it made me feel satisfied to sit around on the internet every day instead of developing an actual life.  It slowly increased more and more until I was drinking anything from 3-4 beers on a good day to a half liter of liquor a day.  Some weekends, I could get up to a liter.  The hangovers were often brutal, but I was still functioning and performing well at work and keeping up relationships with my college friends.  As you all know, that never lasts.

Last week, I started feeling a dull pain on my left side under my ribcage and an occasional light burning feeling around my navel.  Not burning as in incredibly painful - just a kind of weird, resonating light ache in a single area that would come for a few minutes and then disappear for hours. I still feel it right now a tiny bit.  Throughout the week, the painful spots would seem to jump around to different areas around my abdomen, but they were more of an annoyance and didn't affect my ability to eat or get comfortable.  75% of the time, I wouldn't feel them at all. 
Well, a week later, they've gotten a bit better but are still there.  Thankfully, I haven't had any nausea or vomiting, and I'm not turning yellow just yet.

I've read all these stories here about people my age and younger with similar habits finding out that they have all kinds of maladies now, like pancreatitis, gastritis, ulcers, hepatitis, even cirrhosis.  All the symptoms of those diseases fit what I'm feeling a little bit. 
 In most of those cases, the symptoms they had seemed more severe and painful, but I can't deny that something's wrong internally in the areas alcohol messes with.

I don't really go to my primary care doctor unless I have a specific issue to take care of.  I'm not great about regular checkups.  I never told them about how bad my drinking was, and never really needed to because I never had a reaction like this.  I always told myself that I would eventually get bored of the drinking or develop some willpower, so why risk outing myself to the doctor?  After all, it could mean more expensive life insurance or getting rejected for an organ transplant down the line, right?  Well, I made an appointment for next Monday, and I'm going to finally be honest about it.  I don't really know what kind of tests to expect besides blood tests for liver and pancreatic issues, but I'm going to let them do as much as they need to and take whatever shitty news I may have coming.  There's always the chance that I could be wrong here, and that the results won't be as bad as I'm building them up to be, but I can't keep indulging that denial like I've been doing for five years.

My last drink was on Sunday.  I'm hoping to always know October 13, 2019 as the last time I took a drink.  I've gone long stretches cold turkey before without getting anything worse than a little insomnia, but I'm still being careful.  Being mindful of what my body is feeling, and taking my temperature and blood pressure multiple times a day.

Basically, I'm anxious and scared as hell right now, but am still feeling a little bit hopeful for the future now that I'm making an effort to be honest with myself and others.  This isn't gonna be a fun ride, but I'm glad that places like this will be here for support.

I can’t tell you where you’ll be next week. But I can bet pretty safely you’ll be up in 1, 3, 5 years.

HOLD.

Dividends will pay out with every quarter.

But more importantly, you’ll get capital gains over years that you wouldn’t get if you cashed out.

In a decade, it’ll seem obscene your returns. It could be several times over what you would have had if you kept it in cash and drank.

Well, in June I started doing the mental gymnastics that are talked about so much on this sub. Beer with dinner, couple beers while watching the ball game. Well that handled ok for a few months but the past month or so I've been finding myself going on benders of my DOC (Whiskey). I'd do all sorts of elaborate things to conceal it from my wife. Really shitty things to lead her to not believe much of anything I say and justifiably so. 

Well, on Friday after managing to imbibe a liter of whiskey - my wife got wise and found the bottle in my backpack. I was still stupid drunk when she confronted me...To make a long story short I stormed out of the house and jumped in my car. Didn't make it 2 blocks before I got in a wreck and a DUI. I'd always been lucky in the past to avoid DUI's or alcohol related crashes. Not so much this time. Now I have no car, probably won't have a license soon, and still without a job. I can not allow myself to fail this time. 

I've been to 2 AA meetings since Saturday morning and plan on going to 4 a week for the foreseeable future. I'm filled with so much anxiety, fear, remorse, shame, etc. I've still got all sorts of ramifications to deal with the DUI and I can't imagine things getting much worse aside from losing my wife and infant child or getting in further trouble with the law.

There was a room full of vendor booths with all kinds of wines, large grazing tables with cheese, fruit, and charcuterie, and wine enthusiasts milling around.  I remember feeling wistful and fantasizing about tasting wines.  I felt sad, thinking, ""will I never be able to do this again?  Enjoy being a participant at a wine tasting?  I want to sip wine and eat cheese!!"" I felt awkward, too.  At one point a vendor handed me a glass and poured a little in, insisting that I try.  I let the wine touch my lips but didn't drink.  There was too much shame attached to my sobriety at that point to be able to say out loud that I did not drink.  It all felt hard and like a drag.

I kind of expected to have some of the same feelings as last time, but was pleasantly surprised that I didn't really feel any of that.  I still wanted the cheese... but I didn't really feel a longing for the wine.  It was really nice to have these two similar events to compare and contrast.  A year ago, the thought of trying to give up alcohol with any kind of permanence was really scary.  It's really empowering and encouraging that I am seeing an attitude shift in myself!  

To anyone just starting who feels scared when they think of their future without alcohol; there is a reason people say to just take it one day at a time.  Focus on today.  Don't focus on the events in the future that you are worried you will miss out on. You might find that those events won't seem as enticing with a little more time.",23

It’s a band I’ve wanted to see for 10+ years and finally was given the opportunity, my father bought me tickets for him and I to go for my birthday. I have never felt so excited and so lucky that this is it finally I’m going to experience seeing them live! I pondered with the idea of having a few drinks before the concert but told myself and my SO the week before that I was going to remain sober as this was super important to me and I wanted my memories to be crisp and clear. 

Of course the day of the concert I was super excited and my father and I went to grab a bite to eat we had a few hours to kill before heading to the show, I without even a thought ordered a glass of wine somewhere I’m sure thinking “it’s just one glass it won’t do much” but of course one glass turned into 5 which turned into taking 3 shots before entering the venue and then proceeding to purchase a drink at the event.  I feel personally once I hit a certain point in my mind I’m totally fine and coherent which I did act the entire show but waking up the next morning my memory is SUPER foggy, I barely remember much about the show at all. I am so angry and sickened with myself that I even drank there was no reason to?? I’m never going to get that experience back and truly feel so depressed and in not a good place about this. This was supposed to be an amazing happy experience for me and instead now I’m beating myself up about it and My anxiety is next level. I just can’t seem to cope with the fact that I wrecked that chance to see my favourite band live what is wrong with me. 

I’ve always had trouble with just having one drink 99% of the time it turns into 3,4,5,10. I have tried to stop before and made it a few weeks maybe max a month but somehow always convince myself drinking is fun! Only to always wake up the next day remembering things I said/ did that I didn’t mean and feeling that horrible pit of regret and anxiety for days on end. I feel like ruining this experience for myself has been a real eye opener and I know that I need to stop drinking all together, I know I can have fun without booze but my social anxiety normally gets the best of me and I end up drinking so I don’t feel awkward. 

I guess I’m hoping posting in this thread will help me cope somehow? I’m feeling So incredibly upset about the show and how hazy my memory of it is and just wish I could go back and re do :(

I went around my house. Took the alcohol, took the drugs, and flushed it all. (Im sorry to the potential damage for the water systems but it had to be done). 

For once, I finally listened to the voice that said ""you know, just because you spent money on it, doesnt mean you gotta finish it"". ""What about just saying no?""

I contemplated for what felt like hours if I should just have one more drink. Or just a bit more drugs. 

But! Enough was enough. I finally just got rid of it and with no excuse of ""why waste of money"" I always use. 

The true waste of money is buying it in the first place. 

But the grief just hit me today. Like discovering the person you fell in love with had been lying to you the whole time. But I see the situation for what it is. And I no longer want to hurt myself.

Im sure this will pass, and I will feel happy to be away from this toxic relationship. It was a lapse. But getting back on track is possible!",10

I’m an alcoholic and drinking is just about the worse thing for my mental health. About a month ago, I was drinking daily to the point of wanting to die. It scared the hell out of me, I most certainly want to live.

So that was my wake up call, my holy shot moment. If I continue to drink, I will certainly end up hurting myself. I also simply cannot get better if I’m always trying to numb the pain.

Thankfully my moods have leveled out. I’m here because I just came back from a trip where I drank. To be honest to drank vodka to calm my nerves and ended up making a fool of myself and even bough I passed out for most of the flight, my tummy was fucked. Puked several times as I became more and more dehydrated. Thankfully it passed after I slept, but still a good reminder.

Since, I’ve been ‘normal drinking’ but it’s time to hold myself accountable:

Drinking makes my life and mental health unmanageable. Drinking is a crutch to relieve social anxiety and stress. Drinking literally makes me suicidal. Drinking hides all the deeper work I need to do to address my trauma history.

Being sober allows me to be productive at home and at work. Sobriety enables me to sleep through the night. Sobriety enables me to names my feelings and demons, taking back my power in the process. Sobriety leads to real connections with friends, surroundings, and events. 

I will not drink with you today. I will go to the gym, tidy around the house, lay out my clothing the night before, make lunch, and ^*take my meds*^",1

I drank secretly everyday and as we know it just gets worse. I reached the point that I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I read the quit lit and it worked. I don't even have cravings. I didn't white-knuckle it like attempts  in the past. I huge burden lifted from me. 

And now a challenge. 
My elder brother moved back home with his  wife and kid after living in the States a few years. Things were not working out for them there. My brother was once a heavy drinker. In his late 20s it got to bottles of spirit a day , a divorce, lost jobs. That was 25 years ago. Then, there was only AA as a support. He said it saved him and he preached it adamantly for years . He would talk about it endlessly. He met wonderful people there. He became a much nicer person. He left a few years ago for the US to marry his  ex sweetheart . Somewhere in the last few years he started drinking again. He makes out it's moderate. Under control. Like...say.. WHAT?!
I was saddened he drinks again. After all HE   told us all the scare stories of the disease of alcoholism. His life had totally derailed in the past. 

My drinking was different and insidious and became a problem in the last few years. I was what he called ""a functional alcoholic"". In the past, under the impression he was not drinking I reached out to him. He put me in contact with a friend of his  from AA. She was lovely but I never connected with the AA philosophy. To be honest, if anything it made it worse for me when the friend told me all her past of heavy drinking. I just thought...hell I'm not THAT bad !
Finally as the shit started to hit the proverbial fan I found the groups on Reddit, read Alcohol Explained, This Naked Brain. Listened to Craig Beck. It worked. I'm feeling so much better.
I have been on holidays, to parties, had huge challenges...no inclination to drink and my resolve to live AF feels/ felt solid.
And then...

My brother appears, seemingly "" moderately"" drinking. He does actually seem to have a grip on it. I told him I was 3 months sober and he was so happy then put me down for being on social media support groups and not the ""real thing"" AA. I told him of the mocktails I tried and how they were starting to be a new thing in Europe.  He rolled his eyes and said ""stupid millennial trends"". Now I love my brother. I do. And I am beginning to wonder if he is right. Maybe oneday I can drink a bit. He seems to be able to. However somewhere inside I know that his life would be much stabler no booze. I haven't told people around me apart from 2 close friends and close family about my past drinking and recent sobriety. They have been amazingly supportive. I am disappointed at my brother.

But I got through it and I looked on the bright side, practiced gratitude, and kept things on track (wobbly, but on track).

Strange to think that’s still a thought process that sits so close to the surface in my mind.

But also reassuring to have that thought immediately followed by ‘Nope, I’ve had far worse days, and this is just life being life. It doesn’t warrant a desire to drink, and what I actually want to do is just go home, rest a bit, be warm, go to bed early, and get up and try again tomorrow’.

Longtime drinker/binge drinker. Drugs are a part of my story (weed, klonopin) for reference. 

On 9/30/19 I (39/m) decided that enough was enough, I needed a life change. I needed to stop drinking. I've tried in the past and always succumbed to my own want to numb myself with alcohol or other substances. I had a moment of clarity that told me that I haven't grown as a person in over 15 years. I've been married for 13 years and have two beautiful kids (10 and 7). My wife and I met in college and our relationship was essentially built around alcohol. 

Her parents are divorced and her father is a successful, functioning alcoholic by his own admission. Her mother doesn't work and drinks rum and cokes all day long. Before our kids got to the age they're at now, my mother in law would pickup our kids from school etc. and watch them until my wife and I got home from work. Looking back I can't believe that I allowed her to do this while most likely drunk. 

My family is out of state and my father never has more than a beer or two when he comes to visit. The rest of my extended family are essentially the same but they can party with the best of them when it comes to weddings, birthdays and special occasions. 

I state all of this because when I decided to get sober, I decided to attend AA meetings for support and work the steps. At the beginning of this, my wife was a bit confused but was okay with it. As time has gone on, she has gone out of her way to question whether I am an alcoholic and if AA is the right way to proceed. Even more than this, she questions if I need to stop drinking at all since (her words) ""All of our friends drink and that's what we do"". 

I find this to be disheartening and in my own head, I consider it a warning. She says my problem is with self control and she is absolutely right. One is too many and a million is never enough. I have tried to explain to her that I want to quit drinking (and my long term, prescribed klonopin habit) to live a better life and to grow as a person. She says she likes drinking with me and that I don't have a problem. I countered that I am doing it for me, our kids and our marriage. I also mentioned that just because my life isn't in the gutter and I don't have some gruesome drunken resume doesn't mean that I can't or shouldn't make this change. 

For the past day or so, I've been torn about continuing with AA and working the steps. I have a sponsor and had planned on working the steps soon. I have also started to taper my Klonopin so I can FINALLY get off of the booze pills. I have fears on both sides. On one side I am concerned that I am wasting mine and my sponsor's time and that I will turn back to alcohol because of my fear of what will happen to my wife and I's relationship. I feel like I am at a decision point and I need to decide what to do. 

Any comments or insight is appreciated, thank you for letting me vent.",2

And it feels good. I feel a lot better. Still got a lot of worries and bad thoughts, but they don't make me want to drink. I just don't crave it at all anymore. I think I finally reached the point where I know it does absolutely nothing for me and makes everything endlessly worse.

I won't drink today or tomorrow or rhe next day, and that's something I'm really proud of.

Now can someone help me to reconfirm my date is correct? I stopped drinking late Tuesday night, it was September 17th, 2019.

So wtf do I do. I really don't feel sociable or capable of dragging myself out of this rut today. I'm worried I'm acting very standoffish and aloof at work as a consequence. And I cant tell anyone why that is because of the stigma. 

I feel like I need to just go home and rest my mind. I did this a few weeks ago, took a few days off just to get my strength back. But i cant keep doing this every three weeks as a way to combat an impending relapse.

Do you guys get this? How can I plow through? White knuckling seems very hard and I'm very conscious that I'm making people feel uncomfortable. Thanks",5

3 months ago I wrote in my diary that I would never to be able to control my addictions. I was soooo scared to quit drinking. I thought my life would be over. That I would be a boring person with a boring life. But life has never been so exciting, and last 3 months I grew more than ever. Here a list of things that changed, big and small.

\-A lifelong struggle of eating disorder (never ending circle of binging/dieting) disappeared: I finally have a (close to) normal, balanced relationship to food.

\-I no longer have sex I regret the next day

\-I am going to therapy and learning a lot

\-I quit my side-job as sex worker

\-My memory has improved a lot

\-I realized that I have always lived in my head: I totally lost connection with my body and my feelings, and Im working on that right now

\-I live more intentional

\-I quit smoking and doing drugs

\-I realized that Im a really social, fun person, also (probably even more!) without booze 

\-I realized that I always played a ""cool"" version of myself. Now Im working on being more vulnerable and authentic.

\-My childhood trauma's came to the surface and I realized how much it still unconsciously controls me.

\-I realized that I have a huge fear of failure/rejection but I always outvoiced that part of me, pretending for myself and others I was fearless. In scary/nasty sitations I just stepped out of my body while doing some sort of act.

\-I am making more friends that actually fit me

\-I finally found two jobs that totally fit me and make me happy with people who bring out the best in me

\-I am way more productive and creative

\-I am less ADD, my life is not a big mess anymore 

\-I am more stable and more myself: when I still drank and did drugs my life was made out of chemical highs and chemical lows. It never felt as if it was really me. 

\- I have a long skincare regime. This is a symbol for me for taking care of myself.

\-I am much more sensitive

\-I experienced a few sober moments that were like pure xtc: total happiness and able to feel everything in my body

\-I see much more clear what and who in life fits me, and what things/people were just ""fun"" because I was drunk. 

\-My conciousness is growing everyday and I have so much insights about myself and my life

\-....and much more!

For me living without drinkgs and drugs feels like learning how to walk again. All these assumptions about myself and my life fall apart and are getting -step by step- replaced by new, more fitting ones.

Drinking for me was a way to live ""fully and adventurous"" and numb negative feelings. Now I start to realize that these ""negative"" feelings are part of living fully. What seems boring to me now is numbing my emotions and senses and hanging out in places and with people who are actually really dull to me.

Sobriety is not all puppies and sunshines. Getting sober is not just some magical pill that will transform your life. But it does bring your problems to the surface so you can actually work on the root of the problem in stead of just numbing everything away. If you are having a hard time, please remember: booze is never the solution. In the ""best"" case it shifts your problems to tomorrow, in the worst case it makes your problems even worse. 

Good luck everyone!

It isn't that we haven't been intimate since I moved out but the post divorce shenanigans kept me away and when we were intimate, alcohol was still part of the equation. I met with said friend, he had, had 1 drink. Myself none. I just wanted to be present. We had dinner... left overs from the food I made for him the day before. Attempted to watch a little TV but reception was bad. So, we headed to the bedroom. It was without a doubt the best sex I have had in years... because I or we were present.

2019-10-15 02:47:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/di3xwp/day_one_i_guess/,Day one i guess,"i've been drinking a lot over the past 6 years, and its been weighing on me more and more as time passed.

at first i started drinking to forget about the things that were bothering me. Feeling like I wasn't living up to my own expectations was a big worry. I didn't think it was a big deal, and at the time it wasn't. I just drank a beer or two after work every day. Something to make me feel good. drink a beer and play some games online with friends. Then maybe drink another. Maybe another.

I dont know exactly how long it took for it to become an entrenched habit, or how long it took for it to get out of control, but there was always this voice in my head telling me ""this really can't become a habit. you'll stop before it does. you're responsible."" All the time i'd be convincing myself that, really, I wasn't like the ""stereotypical alcoholic"" who can't go a day without drinking.. but I had it all wrong. 

Before I really knew what was happening, I didn't drink beer anymore. I went straight for liquors. I'm a very mathematical person and I was calculating that it was the best way to get that nice buzz for my dollar. I don't know when I started thinking this way but it was definitely more than three years ago. That, I think, is when everything changed. It wasn't a small deal anymore, because I wasn't just believing that there was nothing wrong. On a subconscious level, at that point i'm sure, I really knew there WAS a problem. I was just trying to find the most economical way to live with it - while still convincing myself that i'm no drunk. I just  want something to keep me from thinking too much at the end of a hard day.

I wasn't lying to myself about that. I really did want to stop thinking too much about my life at the end of a hard day. But the want grew larger over time, harder to ignore. My personal bar for what qualified for a ""hard day"" got lower and lower. Somewhere along the line, the want became a need. Now I'm sure there's no way I can go through an entire day without wanting to drink. Its not voluntary. It hasn't been for a long ass time. Working days are easier because there's always something to do and - luckily enough for me, I see what I do as somewhat important, so it motivates me to keep going at my hardest, and that's enough to stop me from thinking about alcohol during the working day.

As soon as I come home, though... it's all over. One minute of idle thought is enough to bridge the gap between my mind and alcohol. Maybe not even one minute. On my days off, getting me to not think about drinking is like trying to get me to not think about breathing. It just happens. And then there's no getting it off my mind. It's there no matter what I do, no matter what I try to distract myself with. Like an itch. I didn't notice it until I tried to stop.

This was about a year ago. I finally started to entertain the idea that \*maybe\* its a problem. I'll just convince myself that it isn't by SUCCEEDING at laying off alcohol for two weeks.

I didn't last two days.

""This isn't a problem, I just won't go through with the two-weeks-no-alcohol thing because I know that i'd succeed anyway if I really wanted to. I just don't want to."" Pour a drink.

Six years since I started drinking - at least the point where I can identify there was a chance for it to start becoming a problem - and I look at the cabinet where i keep my liquor bottles. I'm running low. The last time I went to the store to buy a 1.75 liter bottle of 100 proof vodka was.. four days ago? Was it four? Am I telling myself it was four or was it really four? Was it... \*fewer?\* Four's too little time. That's insane. Why are you drinking this much? How many bottles of vodka have you bought in the last 3 months? I'd go through my bank records but I'm too ashamed and embarrassed for myself to even bother checking.

Drinking doesn't even make me feel good anymore. It just makes me feel not bad - for like 5 minutes. Then I'm not feeling anything. And I have to drink because I don't like feeling nothing. Then I'm feeling lethargic and stupid. And I have to drink because of that. Then I feel like I can't do the things I like doing anymore because I'm too drunk. Then I'm sad. And I have to drink.

FUCK THIS. FUCK THIS. IM SO FUCKING TIRED OF THIS. FUCK THIS STUPID SHIT IM SO FUCKING DONE. PLEASE JUST GO AWAY.

I dont want to need to drink. I dont want to think about it all the time. I dont want the feeling of needing to clench my fists and teeth to not feel that sensation of ""oh man i'd really like a drink right now. Doesn't it suck being sober?""

I took the last of my liquor and poured it down the drain. Then I immediately felt like someone who dropped their phone in the toilet. I think i have to be strong now. It's 2:45 in the morning as I finish writing this. I threw the alcohol out 15 minutes ago and started writing here. I want to fucking stop. I want to fucking stop really bad and I don't know if i'm strong enough. I considered making a throwaway but half-drunk me decided that not doing so would steel my resolve.

So day one i guess. Zero? god fucking help me.",16

Two full days.","It's Monday night after midnight, so technically early Tuesday, and the last time I drank was Saturday morning at 8:30 AM. I stopped drinking for good two days ago now. My main goal for getting sober is my mental health.

A year ago I knew I had a drinking problem. I've tried to stop and failed after a few days many times. I wasted hundreds of dollars by taking a drink or two, and then feeling guilty, and dumping out the rest of a liter of whiskey, a six pack, or even a 12 pack. Most days I'd do this twice or sometimes three times in a day.

I don't have the money to spend. I have schizophrenia and live with my parents, I get $514 a month to live on. I would beg my parents for $10 every day to get booze. Sometimes I would spend half an hour convincing them. When my sister would come over for movie night I'd beg her and convince her to buy me a bottle.

I told myself I wasn't a mean drunk, but I realize now that I used to criticize my loved ones about every little thing. Making a big deal out of little things, and bringing people down when they were happy about something. That's a mean drunk IMO.

My anti psychotics make me drowsy, and when I drink  that tired feeling is multiplied. But I realize now that my anxiety really played a factor in continuing with alcohol. I would tell myself that some day in the future I may be celebrating something and I won't be able to not drink, so I may as well keep drinking now. I may as well get a six pack now, since I can't go forever without a drink. Or I imagined being judged by new people I may meet for being sober, and I'd have to admit I have a drinking problem.

I've done research and found out drinking can make anxiety worse, especially when the buzz wears off. I noticed I had voices in my head to extremes while I was bringing. I would pass out when I wanted to be having fun. Sometimes I didn't remember what happened.

One thing that has been an issue is my love for entertainment like music and movies. Drinking is all over it! I see good people drinking moderately on TV and I want to be that. But I can't drink moderately. It just doesn't happen for me. I'm considering switching to Christian music since they are usually promoting redemption and don't glorify drinking. I also asked my sister to find some music without words or that sing about positive things. Moby is a sober artist I can get in to.


So I'm going to stop drinking for good, for my mental health, and for my loved ones. Not to mention my wallet. My psychiatrist will be proud of me when I tell him mid November that I (will) have been sober for a month. But for now I'm going to bed, proud of myself for going two days on my journey so far.

Even though I’m nine months sober and not craving booze like I was, when I am feeling bad, my addiction pushes the pedal to the floor.

It’s partly that I drank while sick for years, but more than that, I have trained my body to interpret sickness as hangover. So when I’m ill, some part of me shifts back to the old logic that says, “Hey, just hang in there until 4:15p little lady, then you can start drinking this feeling off,” or “It’s an easy day, have a drink with lunch.”

I’ve disrupted many of my patterns around drinking (drinking to celebrate, etc.), but the desire to drink when ill stays in place; it is a hard reminder of how I’ve treated myself and the trickery of an addiction that is doggedly determined to convince me that I’m not worth it, that I can’t care for myself.

Here we are. 

Although I am closing the gap to year 1 fast, it is imperative that I remember this is only year 1 (when the time comes). I have spent 2+ decades drunk out of my mind. I observe and accept the changes in my life. 

Facing uncomfortable truths without the bottle to make it warm and fuzzy is hard. This is also my chance at redemption, and I try to remember that these challenges are MY life's goings and I will be judged in how I overcome them. This could be the key in life: to know that, despite ambitions and dreams, our courage and strength is tested in how well we handle these challenges at hand. No promises, no epic battles, just the mundane day to day challenges that add up to a mountain.


On that note, I am taking the uncomfortable steps of challenging questionable friendships, and rebuilding family ties. I am in the process of changing the entire environment I have dwelled in for many years. It never felt like home and I am taking the uncomfortable step of changing it. No it is not too late to start again, despite tricks of the mind. And I will continue fighting this good fight. And remember, if I can do it, so can you.

I went to an AA meeting at noon and my sponsor gave the secretary a chip for me and they made a big deal about it at the meeting. It's not normally a chip meeting so I was caught totally unawares. It made me feel really good.

Three months ago I didn't even know if I really wanted to get sober. I went to a meeting that day after having gone back out for about a year and a half because I didn't want to drink THAT DAY and I didn't know what else to do. Then I found myself at meetings every day that week. Then I found myself asking a guy I'd known who was a mess the last time I was in AA but who had gotten his shit totally turned around to be my sponsor. Then I found myself working through the twelve steps in a way I never had before. Suddenly I was in it to win it.

In the last 91 days I've lost 35 pounds, started really getting in shape, gotten my substitute teaching credential, got accepted to a nearby university to pursue a teaching credential, become much better able to help my mom who's showing signs of dementia, made some really good and true friends, been courting a really nice girl who I think may well be interested in me and in general turned my life completely around.

I have hope, real hope, for the first time in a long time. I know that if I stay sober and keep working on my recovery that those hopes can become reality. If things have improved this much in three months how much can they improve in a year? In five years? In a decade?

I feel like the sky's the limit right now and it's awesome and it has everything to do with not drinking. I may not post or comment often here, but I read many posts and take much inspiration from this place. So thank you all for being here, and if you're new and struggling I think a little AA aphorism is appropriate here: Keep coming back.",92

To preface this, the week leading up to this one was the WORST. Drank 4 of 7 nights, accused my SO of cheating (has never happened before and I have zero cause to think this. Drunken ramblings, ya know?) resulting in our first fight in almost two years, and was so out of it by the end, I picked up the SO’s bowl he had packed for the morning and smoked it till it was ash. I hadn’t smoked in months and I have a drug test a week and a half from now.  I woke up the morning after to an empty bed and that familiar feeling of dread where you can’t quite remember what you did the night before, but you know it was BAD. So, I decided then and there that was it. I have lost jobs, relationships, and much more because of this fuckery, and something just clicked. After the hangover wore off and I took my well deserved ass chewing and slap to the face, (I deserved it. In almost 5 years we’ve been entirely monogamous without a single hiccup. I was WAY out of line) I made a promise to myself and the SO this would never happen again.  I took a week off work because I knew this was going to be unpleasant..The first day was rough. Even with the remnants of a whopper hangover clinging on, I still wanted to go to the bar. Didn’t. Second and third day I basically didn’t leave the bed. I felt awful. No shakes but no appetite, couldn’t sleep, hot/cold/hot/cold, wanted zero social interaction, even with the SO. Fourth and fifth day I went out and ran normal errands but still felt like what I imagine an old dish sponge feels like. Not as bad as days 1-3, but still not 100%. Day 6 was the real turning point. I woke up (yesterday) and felt... human. A little bit odd and bored because my brain isn’t hasn’t operated sober for about 15 years, but clearheaded and motivated to get up and do something. I cleaned our entire apartment, packed up about 20 boxes worth of stuff, (were moving in November) made dinner, and washed all the laundry. I’m not ever this productive in one day guys. Seriously. Which brings us to day 7! Today! SO woke me up with breakfast and I actually ate it! I’m not a breakfast person, and definitely not when my mouth still tastes an animal bathed in scotch crawled in and died, but I was ravenous and ate every bite! The SO asked if we could sit down and have a serious talk. I’m thinking “oh shit, here goes. He thought about it for a week and decided it just isn’t worth it and this is it. I’m moving back home in my 30s” But to my surprise, he raised the issue of my career. I have been a bartender and bar manager for 12 years now, and in my idiocy, would SWEAR up and down it contributed nothing to my drinking. Master of self deception here. Anyways after several hours of soul searching, crying, and really looking at our future going forward as a couple, he told me he loves me more this week than he has in months and he was terrified that when I went back to work all this ground we’ve covered would go straight to hell the second the bar closed (the entire staff hangs out for a couple hours after close and drinks. Every single night without exception). I sat there very quietly for a solid 2 minutes before asking, “do you think I should quit my job?” “Yes.” Zero hesitation, zero doubt, just a staunch, adamant “yes”. This from the man who takes 40 minutes to decide on a fast food restaurant... something tells me he hasn’t approved of my career for quite some time lol. When I asked what if we could afford to do that right now, his response made me cry all over again. He said “I don’t care about the money. My business is doing well, we have savings, and even if those things weren’t true, we would figure it out because nothing is more important than what you’re trying to do right now.”  So, this afternoon, I called my boss and tendered my resignation. I apologized profusely for not being able to give him at least two weeks notice, and tried explaining the situation, but he didn’t care. I’m an unreliable piece of shit and blah blah blah.. ya know what? Unfazed. Normally this would crush me, as I pride myself on being the absolute best employee in that building, but today.. I swear I could hear the panic in his voice. He, too, is a career alcoholic who can barely run that restaurant; and that’s WITH me doing the scheduling, inventory, training, hiring, firing, and basically everything except payroll. I would panic too if I suddenly had about 1000% more work to do after drinking  in a closed restaurant till 5 am. I genuinely feel for the guy, and I know he was just lashing out in fear and probably a little hurt (we were pretty tight) but I have never felt so sure I made the right decision. After the call, I updated my resume, contacted a temp agency that could place me somewhere entry level, and have an interview tomorrow at a very standard 9-5 call center. It’s a pay cut, but I feel the change of scenery makes up for the reduced salary. It’s odd changing careers in your 30s.. restaurants and bars are all I know, but damn it. This is RIGHT.  I also plan on proposing at some point in 2020, and had my behavior continued for much longer, I FULLY believe I would have lost him before I got that chance. This community has been amazing. Reading all your success stories, and seeing the outpouring of support has really made me feel safe sharing this, and I hope you guys can take some encouragement from my small victory today. Big changes coming, and I know it won’t always be as awesome as today feels, but god dammit, IWNDWYT!!!!!",7

My girlfriend was finally sick of me treating her like shit. I wasn’t there for her ever, I was a shell of a person, never tended to her needs, but gorged in my needs. 

After 2.5years of mistreatment and making her feel unloved and unwanted she had enough. I had pushed her away. I don’t blame her for leaving me, I take full responsibility for her leaving because her desires weren’t met.

Im giving her time and space before I ultimately pack my stuff and move. I started reading “Healing the Addicted Brain” and who knows how much I’ll retrain because my brain is so fuzzy from my abuse.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's an early check-in this time. I got up at 3:00 this morning (!!!!) to drive my daughter to tour the university that she is attending after high school graduation. It was a long drive but so much fun! But I am one tired mama and feared I might fall asleep if I didn't post soon.

Being here completely to do this with my daughter is one huge thing that couldn't happen if I was still drinking. And there's dozens of small things that happen now, too, like always washing my face before bed, always having clean sheets, having a mostly consistent bedtime. If I ever feel unsure of why I still work on sobriety, I make a list of these little things. I hope all of us have a list that keeps growing! I will not drink with you today!",77

\- Voted in a local election

\- Finally got to the post office and bought stamps to mail off a bunch of documents I've been putting off for weeks

\- Updated the address on my driver's license I've put off since June

\- Got an inspection sticker I'd been putting off for a year

\- Picked up supplies at Home Depot for home renovations

\- Had a pleasant afternoon in a coffee shop ordering furniture and paying bills.

\- Used an electric handsaw for the first time to trim a door that was too long, and then sanded, painted and installed the door

\- Painted/clear-coated the floor tiles in my bedroom

\- Built a ladder for my loft

\- Painted a few walls

&#x200B;

And today I was off work and I did mostly NOTHING and it felt AMAZING. I worked out, showered and then laid around watching nature documentaries, reading, taking small naps and now I'm reading through posts on here before reading more of This Naked Mind. I know with 100% certainty that I would not have accomplished 3/4ths of that list (if any of it) had I still been drinking the way I was on the weekends prior to three weeks ago. The drinking started in the late afternoon and lasted until well past midnight, the hangovers lasted for days. Sundays were a blur of writhing, self-loathing, bloating, terrible diet, upset stomach, racing hearbeat, extreme anxiety and isolation. Today I felt no guilt, no shame and no anxiety whatsoever for laying around because I felt like I deserved it.

I still get cravings, and loneliness is present (I have a friend who I consider to be one of my closest who hasn't really checked in these past three weeks, despite knowing what I'm going through and my bringing it up a few times), but I know I'm way better off clean.

Just wanted to put this out there for anyone starting out. The first week was very ""pink cloud""--I'm going to get better, I'm inspired. The second week got dark and I got lethargic. The weekend felt like I was white-knuckling it through. The past week got better as a ""new normal"" felt like it was happening, and then this past weekend was just great, despite being a little isolated. I'm going to make some efforts to be more social next weekend.

I am on day 18 sober and I feel amazing, both physically and mentally (in the last year and a half I’ve been sober once for 14 days). Sleep is even awesome! I can’t remember the last time I could sleep throughout the night without being blacked out.

All that being said, I’ve went through 3 jobs this year because of my drinking. Bills and problems that I let sit idle while I was drinking, I have to face the consequences for. The 3rd job I lost I’m not so ashamed of, it was a new one and I lost it because I chose to go to and institution and get clean. I do believe this is for the best on both ends since the place I worked for encouraged drinking on the job.

I finally had an interview today and got the position! 

I’m not entirely sure what I’m trying to say here, but none of my problems make me want to drink. If someone like me, drinking a fifth a day can do this, so can you!

All my illusions about drinking have been shattered. I can't moderate, I can't hide it from my wife, I can't go back to how I was and live with myself, they aren't options anymore. 

I'm very afraid I'll relapse. I want to drink very often, but I can't unsee the truth. I saw my family come apart as a kid because of my dad's drinking and now I've had a chance to reflect with a sober mind on my own failings with my wife and young child.

I figured I would try and taste it to see if it was still good. It still looked all right and smelled fine. It tasted amazing as well and I was able to finish most of the can. The rest I just poured down the sink.

Then I realized I may have made a huge mistake. Expired juice I think can turn into alcohol but I wasn’t even considering that at the time.

Now I’m freaking out because I may actually be under the influence of alcohol right now. Before this I was at 14 days which is my longest streak of the year. Please tell me I did not drink any alcohol. I didn’t even consider it at the time. If it was alcohol this makes me so mad 😡. To fall off the wagon inadvertently

More motivation, more energy, less anxiety from withdrawals.

One thing that has not gone away (besides the depression that I know I will have to find another way to deal with) is the insomnia I had since I started tapering. I still wake up 3-5 times per night and sometimes can’t go to sleep for hours. Melatonin helps a little….

My first time trying to get clean about a month ago was really tough. Both my boyfriend and I have really bad drinking problems. For about 2 years I managed to stay sober until earlier this year, he started mixing drinks regularly and I eventually decided, ""alright. One or two would be fine.""

I started drinking heavily when he wasn't home. Sometimes he could tell if I reeked of booze but most often I was already asleep by the time he got home from work.

He drinks almost every night, but I'm more of a binge drinker, I think? Usually he'll have beer which I hate, but he started getting hard seltzers and I've definitely come close to relapsing multiple times. When I discussed this with him and insisted, ""we should stop drinking"" he basically told me... I was projecting my problems onto him. That I'm preaching about shit he already knows but he can control his alcohol better than me so he didn't see why he needed to stop.

Another time I told him ""I don't like it when you drink, you get really mean"" he says, ""am I? Or is it because I don't tolerate your bullshit anymore?""

All within... the same month I tried quitting. And I... Relapsed. And despite how badly he treated me in my attempts to stay sober I can't help but feel guilty for lying about not drinking. I spent a day away from him with my family just to drink. My friends were around me when I apparently said some horrible stuff when one had to pull me away and take me home. Last time this happened, they refused to tell me what it was and laughed at me. After I swore I wouldn't do it again... I did. And I deeply hate myself for it.

It's day 2 and Im still suffering from crippling anxiety. Despite eating so little all week I feel like I can't keep anything down. Im considering upping my zoloft dosage if I decide to talk with my doctor. My hydroxyzine only helps keep me asleep. Today, my heart still feels so very heavy and I feel so alone. I continue to struggle with these suicidal thoughts as I lay in bed, desperate to distract myself.

If I make it through November, it will be my first sober fall & first sober birthday. I took 6 weeks medical leave to help deal with anxiety and establish some new habits and thinking patterns. It has been a very rough road at times....but one realization is that I have difficulty with daily mundane life, but paradoxically, trouble with too much chaos  - especially mental chaos. This translates into being a person who needs to feel he is moving ahead in life...growing, learning - and especially adventuring. I love exploring new places and physical challenges. But I do not like fast moving emotional situations or being around emotionally unpredictable people. Strongly emotional people are good - provided they are honest and know themselves. What really throws me off are people who display sadness, anger and disappointment for the wrong thing. I cannot trust people like that and it makes me very anxious to be around them. Unfortunately, my wife is like this.",17

I then said to myself that, ""if you do what you are doing then you are going to loose everything you have worked towards""

If I could go back in time to last night b4 i bouight the drinks I would tell myself that you are a douche and it is not worth the loss of what you have to loose. 

Now this is what I don't want to happen again. If this does then I am nothing more than a liar and a cheat.

I've posted here the past two days about getting fired from my dream job due to my alcohol abuse (well, not showing up to work for some time because my priority was to go on a bender). Thought I'd post some more idle, somewhat non-directional, maybe not entirely positive thoughts this morning.

Some of this might seem better suited for my journal - in fact, I'm not sure I would write anything different there, if I were actually using the thing - but it's nice to read each and every thought that I receive in return here. I'm grieving the loss of this job *immensely*, especially because it was, in my eyes, a very preventable loss, so every little thing I read in response is comforting. It may seem a little petty, because I know people who have lost loved ones, friends, or dear pets, but all the same, I'm a little shook up. Having said that, I've read a few nuggets of wisdom on here, and elsewhere on Reddit, that've helped a bit.

It's tough to accept that there were so many ways I could have prevented this - namely, not going on a bender - but also just reaching out to somebody at work to advise I was having issues, or, moreover, reaching out to pretty much anybody in my life to help me stop.

I suppose I'm not really expressing any specific concern here - I kinda just wanted to get these thoughts out.

I completed these ten months, having only had two beers, in time I was allowed to go have outings (told myself I could drink normally). Every time I had one I scolded myself and said, ""What did you come to FL to did, if you're just going to keep wasting time like this.""

&#x200B;

 After completing that, I was on the straight and narrow for a while until I started noticing bars, more and more frequently, on my bus ride commute from work. The first time I decided to ""just have a few"", I ended up tanked and almost got kicked out of my sober living situation. After stopping for a few weeks, I repeated the incident and was consequently kicked out.

&#x200B;

On the verge of homelessness yet again, I was referred to another half way house. There I found AA, which I actually liked, and started on the process of, once again figuring out what went wrong. That was in July, and have since moved up north with my folks to try and get a doctors opinion on my depression. I go through cycles of not being able to even get out of the bed, talk to anyone in general, and shutting down emotionally. I call out of work constantly because once I miss a few days, I dread the fact of coming back in. 

&#x200B;

Today would have marked 3 months sober, yet this past Friday I ended up drunk again. I can never get away with it. I'm sure my mother heavily suspects what happened based on her changed attitude and demeanor. The medication I'm taking now has helped for a bit, but now it feels like I'm spiraling again. The build up to drink was so strong, and this happened directly after a meeting.

The only things I honestly have going for me are my looks and personality. I get along great with everyone but I disappoint and am not consistant at all to keep any meaningful relationships. It honestly amazes me how insane my life has gotten after 18.

Ive done a few 1 - 12 months sober here and there since i started drinking in my 20's

I started drinking heavy on and off, most of my 30's. I want to eliminate alcohol from my life. 

I want to go alcohol free until my 35th birthday next year, which is about 11 months away.

Hopefully when my birthday arrives, i am so used to being sober, that i dont drink on a special occasion.

I'm mostly posting here for accountability. I'v made a thousand secret deals with myself to stop. its pretty fucking easy to break a contract with yourself that no one knows about.

 I've known that i have a problem since I was 17 years old. Everyone else could have fun and go home to their parents and function like a normal high school kid, I was the one puking in his car, passing out in the woods, and getting arrested.

 I went to treatment when I was 20 years old and stayed sober for 6 years. I got married to a woman who liked to drink. After a year, I thought that maybe I could drink normally. The crazy thing is, for about 6 months I did! Drinking 1-3 beers and stopping when I felt a buzz because I was Scared of becoming the monster I formally was.

 Then I go drunk once, twice, and a million times over. Pounding the cheapest, highest alcohol content beverage the gas station had to offer. Pouring the box of wine directly info my mouth when she asked me to get her another glass. That relationship failed along with several others. I have excuses why every one of them failed. But if i'm truly honest with myself, I know that me being an alcoholic is the main problem.

 I make good money and have a lot of friends. I am the funny guy who charms everyone in that brief period of perfect drunkenness. Then the blackouts come. The mysterious rides home. The random scrapes and bruises. The drunk texts and embarrassing social media activity.

 I'm so tired of this shit, but I'm terrified of being sober. That six years of sobriety seems like a day dream. How did I do it? My brain was different. I was a non drinker, and It wasn't a question whether I would drink. Sobriety was burned into the pathways of my mind. I was strong and my will was iron.

 Now at 30 years old I'm reeling over this decision not to drink a stupid fucking liquid that makes my fat, broke, weak, and embarrassed. Despite my fear, I'm going to give this a shot and this is my written promise to all you wonderful strangers. I will not drink with you today.",4

I went to a party college, joined Greek Life, and worked at a bar. Drinking was just part of my life. It was nothing to get blackout drunk, drive, have sex and not remember, lose stuff, get in fights, get arrested. All of this stuff happened more than once. 

I'm married now and I would drink less for the most part. I could drink socially with my wife and be fine. Then something changed in me and my sense of responsibility became non-existent. I reverted back to my old ways. And that is what has brought me here today. I got nice and drunk this weekend. Nothing happened but it could have. 

I feel anxious, depressed, weak, etc and I believe it is all due to how I act when I'm blackout drunk. I turn into a different person and I jeopardize everything I've ever cared about. I cannot do it anymore.

Was coming to this page every day and even kept a video diary each day to process out my thoughts.  Only made it to day five.

I have been away from this page since then and am now back.

I am looking with a serious lack of confidence at what Friday might bring, or the will I will have when I get there.  I want to do it for my health and my relationships with family and friends.

The first picture is hard for me to see. It serves as a reminder of what I used to be. It was taken by my wife days before I went to treatment on July 6 of this year. I had passed out mid-conversation in the middle of a conference call with work. My wife disconnected my computer so I could pretend my connection was lost.

The next picture was from this morning as I got ready for work.



Today marks 100 days sober for me. I haven't been sober this long without being in some aspect of the judicial system in over a decade. 

I was in rehab for 48 days (for the third time) and somehow, things clicked this time. I've been going to AA consistently, working with my sponsor and a group of people on a 12-Step Study, and journaling every day.

The gains made by sobriety are so amazing so far. I'm closer to God, my wife, my toddler son and my friends. I've started playing the guitar again, started reading more, more diligent in school and work, and have lost 54 lbs through calorie counting and exercise (398-344).

It's not been easy and it's required a lot of work. The most important piece of advice I received from a therapist in treatment was to have a daily list of non-negotiables. These are things related to your recovery that you will not compromise on for anything other than extreme emergency. It can be something as easy as reading a passage from the big book, the Bible (for me), talking with another alcoholic, attending a meeting, etc. Having this checked off as early in the day as possible sets the tone for my day and keeps me on track.

Recovery is a blessing and there is not a one of us that doesn't deserve it.

While the first little while was hard, it seems to have been time because I stuck with it (unlike the many false starts before). It was best to avoid situations which might lead to temptation, or to have an escape plan worked out in advance. 

Now, I am amazed at how little temptation there is. I attended at least three events last week that would have been a serious problem in the past - two receptions and a dinner - and my only complaint was that there were not enough non-alcoholic options available. One reception was at a gala kind of affair sponsored by a couple of governments, and I fully intend to remind them that a sizable percentage of the population does not drink and that they should cater to this as well as to the majority who do.

I am still being wary, as I know full well that an urge can come upon you when you are least prepared. but I am finally starting to consider myself a non-drinker. A new identity!

But I think it would be good for me. Most of my bad life experiences have happened while i was wasted.


Ive slowed way down, I'm not getting blackout drunk, and I only buy from the liquor store once a week, which is hard since its my fathers business and that's honestly one of the only times I see him. But I feel so much better when i don't drink. Its like it messes up my whole week.


But I had a friend from highschool visit from another city and he brought his wife over to play cards. He works at a distillery so he brought a bottle of rum they had produced. They poured drinks and i halfed mine with water and drank slowly; which wasnt too hard because I was thinking of all the homework I have the whole time, but also really hard because I wanted to get hammered like we did in highschool. Just not care about the future for a minute, which scared me.


About an hour into the game they were spilling their drinks and not holding conversation well, and part of me was jealous of them but the other part was just ready for them to leave so i could work. So they uber home when the bottle is empty, im too tired to work and go to bed but not without throwing up the rum first. I'm nauseous basically all the time due to medication but this time it felt more like my body was just over it. My mind is over it. 


In the past I've specifically avoided saying "" I'm never drinking again"" I think so I wouldn't be breaking a promise I suppose, but I think I'm there. I want to be better.

I felt really proud. But ... all the improvement is over. I'm not gonna get smarter or lose any weight. I'm just here with myself, and I am the same piece of shit as always, and I feel terrible.

I'm anxious and sad all the time. I sleep 10 hours a day and I'm still tired. I drink so much coffee it's started giving me splitting headaches. I know I have to start participating in my life again -- improving it even -- but all I want is to be at home, in my bed where I feel safe. I tried seeing a therapist but I couldn't make myself open up to her, so it made me incredibly stressed and ended up quitting after a few weeks. 😔Not sure if it was a bad fit or if I'm bad at being a client.

My boyfriend is, well ... this sub gives me a lot of perspective on how things could be worse. But it really hurts my feelings that he liked me better when I was drinking. I don't know what to do with that information. Obviously I'm not super fun when I sleep all day, and I hope that will improve, but it's not like I was a bundle of joy while I was picking drunk fights with him? It feels like he would trade my health and happiness in a second for the prospect of sloppy threesomes again. 😕

Any tips on sucking less at therapy greatly appreciated ...

2019-10-13 23:00:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dhkmvy/aok_monday_selfcompassion/,AoK Monday: Self-Compassion,"Hi everyone!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

I’ve been thinking today about how the way I treat others is a reflection of how I treat myself. In order to have kindness for others, I first have to have kindness for myself. 

This is something that I struggle with. It’s gotten better with some therapy and some active recovery from my addiction, but it is still something that I have to be aware of. Old patterns of thinking and behaving are still there. I still catch myself getting caught up in critical, judgmental self-talk. There’s basically a narrative in my head about what I’m *not* doing, where I’m not measuring up. It’s self-defeating and also not entirely true, but it’s pretty automatic, and it’s hard to break out of.

Having compassion and kindness towards myself makes it possible for me to have compassion and kindness towards others. I can be harsh and judgmental of others at times. It’s something that I work on, but it’s still there. 

I’m noticing that when I work on being kind to myself, it’s easier for me to be kinder to others. I’m not so quick to jump to critical judgements about what they are doing. I’m able to have more compassion for them as people who also struggle. Having kindness in the way that I think about and talk about others comes through in how I interact with them. 

I’m working on this at work. I’m working on being less judgmental of my coworkers, and trying to view them as flawed human beings who also struggle. I’m consciously choosing to be kind and considerate in my interactions with all of my coworkers, even the people who I don’t always find it easy to work with. 

In some instances it seems to be making a difference. In one instance it doesn’t, but that doesn’t matter. I’m working on doing this because it is who I want to be in the world. I’m not doing this to get any sort of a response from anyone else.

It all started with being aware that I also need to have compassion for myself. Being kind to myself brings me to a place where I can be kind towards others. 

So that’s me for this week. How is everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",25

I’ve never gotten a grade that low before. 7 months ago, I would’ve immediately closed my computer and walked to a bar next door (I live in nyc so that’s how it is lol) or gone to a liquor store and gotten a bottle of wine. I would’ve drank until I was drunk enough to forget that I even took the quiz. While I’m definitely not happy about it, I recognize that I don’t need to do that. I can turn it over and work harder for the next quiz. If I were to get drunk over it, I would never give myself the clarity to study for the next quiz.

I appreciate everyone willing to read this. I’ve been what I would call a heavy drinker for a long time, and I ignored it up until recently when I moved in with some close friends who are only occasional drinkers (social gatherings, a beer with dinner every once in awhile, etc.) I lived alone for a while before hand, but since moving in with them I’ve become more conscious of my drinking and it’s caused me to reflect. It seems that when I buy hard liquor, assuming I don’t have to work in the morning I just binge until I black out. I switched to beer and I still drink maybe 4-6 on those nights but don’t come close to a blackout and I like that I can stay coherent. Every time I tell myself to stop drinking for X amount of time, I do with no problems. It just seems as if when I do drink I tend to binge. I’ve been concerned that it might be getting out of hand but also telling myself that it’s not because I’m not dependent on it to function. I’m sorry for the long post but I feel like I need an opinion as to what to do.

2019 has been a rough year for me and alcohol, and the toll of fighting this is really starting to tear me down. 

I’m 23, but I started drinking at 19. Overall I was what you consider a “normal” drinker until after I had turned 21. Once booze became easy to get I quickly fell down the trap of addiction, and I do mean quickly...

I weighed 210lbs the day I had turned 21. The day I turned 22 I weighed 300lbs. I was out of control. The thought of my drinking being a problem rapidly grew from just a tiny voice in the way back of my mind, to consuming my thoughts for almost every waking moment of my day, as it does today. 

I really put the effort in to change my drinking habits in June of 2018. Around that time I had amassed several thousands of dollars of credit card debt, lost a significant relationship with a girl, and was borderline expelled from my university for not meeting academic standards. I wasted a whole year of tuition just so I could get hammered at home and play video games or watch Netflix. Taking a step back, I could see the dangerous path my life was heading down. It was undeniable that my lifestyle was not sustainable and if I didn’t change, then I would be in real trouble

I’m proud to say that my effort wasn’t in vain.  I lost almost 70lbs and cleared out all of my credit card debt. I also got good enough grades in my classes to get off academic probation. I was really happy about the progress i had accomplished. But I wouldn’t be writing this if that’s how things were today. 

Around the end of 2018 I started drinking “more” again. My best friend moved in with me and this was the first time I had someone to drink with since losing the previously mentioned girlfriend. It was a gateway back into addiction and it took hold of me harder than ever. 

All of 2019 has been a living hell for me. I’ve tried almost every week to get a good streak of sober days going, and I always fail by the weekend. 8 days has been the longest I’ve gone in 2019. Every Sunday I sit in my car, and just talk to myself about my addiction and why I need to get a hold of this thing. Sometimes I scold myself and sometimes I forgive myself.  Or I just talk about how I’m tired of talking about how I need to learn from this failure and get better. 

The fight is draining.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m never not going to believe that what I’m doing is okay. I know it’s killing me and ruining my life.  But I’m at an impasse.  The stress from fighting  this addiction on top of the stress of getting though my last year of college, dealing with weight gain, and going back into credit card debt has worn me down just about to a breaking point. I can tell my mind is not okay because these last 2 weeks I’ve resulted to just staying in at home all day in the dark and avoiding my actual problems in the real world. 


I don’t know what to do next. I’ve considered just focusing only on school and not caring about anything else since I’ve only got until May and then i graduate. But i know i can do some real damage to other parts of my life within that time.  I feel stuck in a Try and Fail cycle and I’m over it. At least I don’t get stressed out by a failure if I don’t try ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 


I’ll end on this note. I’ve forgotten the feeling of joy from a sober life. I know it exists, but all my days with are filled with depression, stress, and anxiety. Imagining a day were that isn’t weighing me down sounds so wonderful and I know I will be there one day. But right now I’ve slipped and fallen into a dark place and I’m too tired to get back up. Currently I’m reading Naked Mind and I’m seriously considering seeing a counselor here soon. Hopefully I find something to get me back to being a fighter and kicking this addiction in the butt. Thanks for letting me open up SD, and thank you to anyone who took the time out of their day to read this.",6

I have no idea what my employment situation will look like in the coming weeks, months, year... but as it turns out, none of that is as important as my health. I've previously been fired from an okay job, I've drank my way through and skipped out on a terrible job, and I've now been fired from an amazing job with great people. Clearly, this drinking problem doesn't really care about where I'm working - I act the same no matter what. 

So, I've got to change my approach. I've had my concerns about AA (having never really given it an honest shot), but it's the only thing I haven't tried in earnest. I've tried all of the big medications, SMART Recovery, Refuge Recovery, extensive counselling and simply being involved in the community with sober friends and a very healthy lifestyle. Once I start feeling good, it's a countdown til everything blows up in my face (my pattern is binges - usually a week at a time). 

So, as the last thing I haven't tried, I went to an AA meeting last night. I'm still not terribly sure about the program, and have some doubts, but it's the only remaining option that I can see, and it if helps, I'll do it.

My advice: don't skip out on work for a week to binge drink and cut off all communication with the world. As it turns out, this is frowned upon by employers. They really don't like that very much.",21

2019-10-13 16:05:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dhfqqo/stop_drinking_101/,Stop Drinking 101,"I have 101 days today and thought I'd write some thoughts on what I learned this time around. The first time I had any length of sobriety was in 2009 and I was miserable the entire time because I wanted to drink. I made it 8 months, but half of that was spent smoking pot and still being miserable. My attitude around alcohol did not change and therefore my desire to drink did not change. It was really just about willpower.

This time around I took everyone's advice on here and listened to ""This Naked Mind"" on repeat. The first time I tried to read it I stopped halfway through and went back to drinking. I had many stops and starts over this last year (October 2018 to October 2019). The lesson of that is just don't give up. Here is what I learned after 101 days:

Alcohol really was causing my anxiety. I am so much calmer than before.

Alcohol really was causing an exacerbation of my depression and suicidal thoughts. Suicidal thoughts ran rampant when I was drunk and/or really hungover. I never feel like that anymore.

It is AMAZING to wake up without a hangover. This doesn't happen right away. In the beginning I felt wonky and sleep deprived, but nowadays I wake up and feel great. I've been battling a cold for the past week and waking up with headaches and fatigue. It blows my mind that I used to do that to myself on a daily basis.

My confidence and self-esteem have skyrocketed. I've always been a fairly confident person who has done well at many things (my job, university, etc). However, being sober I really believe I deserve the praise that I'm given and I strive to do more.

It is so easy to meet your weight loss goals without drinking. I struggled to lose some extra weight I gained on a cruise and over a winter that I could not get off for two years. In the past 101 days I've lost almost 14 pounds without trying too hard. I track my calories, cheat often, but still find myself satiated and losing weight. I'm at a normal weight and know I can easily meet my goal of 10 more pounds but I'm going to do it slowly because it's easier and I feel great with how I look.

Life is just better. In the morning the sky is bright and clear, I notice the birds singing, and I don't dread going to work and avoiding close contact for fear of smelling like alcohol.

The pain in my right upper quadrant is basically gone unless I eat  a bunch of fatty food or sweets. Otherwise it's non-existent.

Life seems hopeful. My brain works better. I no longer fear early-onset dementia due to alcohol abuse. I think I avoided alcohol-related cancers by quitting at 35/36. I really hope so.

I am so much more motivated. I'm learning a third language. I'm picking up huge projects that I'm excited about. I'm driven like I was back in high school and early college.

Having to do laundry doesn't seem like the end of the world. Menial tasks no longer seem practically insurmountable. Life is good.",50

I am back and I am starting again 
Nothing bad happened and I did have a great night but I do not ever want another hangover! I never want another one. 

I think I need to change the pathways in my brain so I'm going to repeat to myself. I don't drink alcohol. I don't want to drink alcohol. Alcohol is a poison. I do not want it in my life. 

Anyway I'm working today and I'm not hungover today but I still feel a little shady. 

I had a little win though because usually to ""eaze"" a hangover I would have had a couple of drinks, so I'm pretty proud of myself for not doing that!

Back on the horse right? Try and try again!

I want to lose 20 lbs and can maintain my weight while drinking but cannot lose weight and that is far more important to me than stupid alcohol. I got into homebrewing as a hobby and when you brew a beer you have 48 beers and having that happen all the time turned into a problem. I started drinking everyday after I started vaping because the vape would stunt my appetite and I would not eat and gain weight like I would without it. Normally I’d have beer, eat a bunch of popcorn and gain weight and then take it off in a few days and do it again but I’m so over it and have had enough of alcohol indefinitely. But after starting vaping I would drink everyday because it wasn’t affecting my weight. 

I was drinking 6-7 beers a day and ended up getting to the point where I’d even have 12-15 if I didn’t have to get up and sometimes when I did. 

I’m so done, I’m over what alcohol does or can offer for at least 4-5 months while I lose the weight.",6

What have you ever done for me except make me feel like shit? It was a turbulent friendship that lasted 25 years, and all throughout you encouraged me to make a complete fool of myself and jeopardize my career and relationships. I drove under your influence countless times and endangered the lives of others. All you ever wanted was my money, and for a long time you had my soul too. You wreaked havoc on my mental health and left me with my self-esteem in tatters. The beginning of 2019 was a nightmare, I couldn’t recognize myself at all, and yet I still kept you around - God knows why! Until one day, the veil just lifted and I saw you for the insidious demon you really are. I’m grateful that it wasn’t a tragic incident that finally sobered me up, because I don’t think I could survive that. It was me deciding enough is enough and that I’m stronger than I think I am. It was the feeling of pure elation when I received optimal test results from my annual physical. It was waking up without the dark cloud of shame and regret hovering over me. It was the renewed ability to be in the moment, to be present with every fiber of my being. It was the cold realization that alcoholism runs in my family and that I’d be playing with fire if I didn’t end this toxic relationship NOW. So goodbye and good riddance. I know you’ll be lurking everywhere I go, but I won’t let you fuck up my social life (or health) ever again. It’s been 50 days and I look forward to the next 50, and the next, and the next.",36
2019-10-13 15:24:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dhf6os/being_hungover_and_recovering_all_day_was_just_a/,"Being hungover and ""recovering all day"" was just a mask to hide my depression."," I'm feeling depressed today for a number of reasons. I'm laying low, watching movies and just recovering from a heavy emotional week. I haven't felt depressed in awhile, and even when I have it's only a few days. I'm already feeling a bit better and up and about my place.

This got me thinking about when I was younger and drinking heavily. It was such a nice excuse to use to stay in bed and not talk to anybody all day that I was hungover and recovering. And then when I was drinking three or four nights a week, the same thing. I was in this cycle of drinking and recovering, and thinking that it was normal.

Now that I'm really far away from all of that, I'm starting to grieve and come to terms with the reality of how I was living. I was drinking to escape pain, and I was masking my depression as recovery from the drinking. I just kept running from those two emotions and I needed more and more alcohol and more and more sex and more and more porn to cover it up.

Now that I don't rely on my addictions to numb my emotions, I get to feel them fully, the highs and the lows. Today is definitely a low, and that's okay. I will treat it, I will process it, and tomorrow is a new day.",1050

2019-10-13 15:20:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dhf4in/feel_trapped_in_aa/,Feel trapped in AA,"Hi friends, first time posting on here.

&#x200B;

I got sober when I went to rehab back in 2015. Their main form of treatment was sending us to AA. I then went to sober living where we were required to go to 5 AA meetings for a week so I have never known how to get sober without it. This is an issue because I am extremely unhappy in the program. I got fed up with having to go to meetings and all the work they tell you to do so I relapsed just to escape. 

&#x200B;

2 years later, I wanted to get sober again so I came back to AA in December of 2018. 4 sponsors later, I am more resentful at the program than ever. I do not believe in a higher power and I was told that is not an issue, however the more I did the steps the more I realized that was a vital part of the program. Furthermore, I have a severe case of social anxiety and I find meetings to be the most overwhelming and triggering of all places for my anxiety. The 4 times I have relapsed since coming to the program in December have been directly after a meeting. I am starting to think about joining a running group as an alternative way to meet friends. People in the program do not seem to like me because I am not gung-ho about AA and I am finding it it to be a very toxic place.

&#x200B;

Now I feel trapped because they drilled it in my mind that if I leave I will become so miserable that I will kill myself, however I feel that way when I am in a meeting. Most of my suicidal thoughts come from feeling trapped in this program, like there is no escape. I am happy at work and happy with friends, but in AA I feel so horrible that it makes me want to relapse, even when I had no thoughts of relapsing before a meeting. P.S. I am also working with an outside therapist on my anxiety issues.

  
Does anyone else have similar experiences? Is it possible to stay sober without AA? I feel so low and desperate to get out of this program. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Have a great rest of your Sunday.",12

Spent yesterday moving my little brothers stuff to my mom's she'd. We lost him in an accident last year and then my dad a month later. I keep getting angry and depressed. I keep trying with my wife but she just gives me hate or no feelings. I took her out to eat for her birthday and spent another 350 in gifts. Tried to win her feelings but it's been gone for a long time. She never supported me through the deaths and just constantly reminds of everything that is wrong with me and everything I've ever done wrong. Never a kind word and I feel pretty worthless all the time. Today I did several things for her and complimented her a bunch. She waits until the deck is done and has me read this story of a guy who always drinks vodka and makes me feel like real shit. I'm not like that guy and I get angry and mention how she never wears her wedding ring and how she leaves overnight and that I can find a story about that. So now it's extra hate from her and she leaves me shitty text messages. I don't think our marriage of 15 years is going to make it and it wrecks me because I do love her but I know she doesn't love me. Worst is how it hits the kids. I just don't know what to do anymore.

  I'm not going to drink but I'm really tired of hurting inside all the time and feeling this way. I can't remember not feeling this way. I'm tired of hiding behind a mask at work and around others.

I've been a member here for a while but I've never decided to post until now. A bit of back story, this is my first time sober in about 15 years. I started drinking when I was 16 and hit the bottle heavy out the gate. I have a family history of substance abuse, had a somewhat rough childhood, and had a really warped sense of what was even socially acceptable, in terms of alcohol consumption. It affected romantic and platonic relationships and drove away a lot of people I really care cared about. But, since alcohol consumed most facets of my life, I just saw my actions as normal and thought others were over reacting. Last year my ex and I broke up, after about 3 years together, with my alcohol consumption being one of a myriad of reasons why. I'll never forget my ex telling me that she hated watching me drink myself to death and that I needed to learn to love myself. At the time, her words were somewhat lost on me but I eventually learned she was right. With the break up and multiple day hangovers, I decided to put drinking on the back burner and, also, found this community. I decided not to fully quit but to slow my consumption down a lot. I thought I was doing fine, aside from a few slip ups here and there. About 6 months later while camping in Yellowstone with some of my best friends, I decided to have a mid day drink. 1 lead to 2, which lead to 4, which lead to 8, etc. I woke up feeling like a bag of hammered assholes and one of my buddies told me that I really worried him the night prior. My friends are assholes and we give each other shit constantly, so when he told me that I knew I had to take a serious look in the mirror. I decided to quit drinking and start eating healthier as soon as I got back home. It's been almost 7 months now and I haven't been this happy or in control in...shit, I don't even know how long. This brings me back to my main point. Last Saturday I found out that my uncle had passed away. I knew he wasn't doing well but it still came as a surprise. My sister and I had thought we had squared away most stuff related to his passing but on Wednesday I found out that my uncle was hand writing checks for my grandmothers care facility (they can only take checks) and that she was due for the last 2 months of payment. I live about 8 hours away from her and my sister lives on the other side of the states. I sent out some emails, explaining the situation to my boss and professors, they were all very understanding, and I hopped in my car and made the drive down. Nothing was easy. Her ID, social security card, and medicare card are nowhere to be found, but I was able to get her to the bank and keep her cognizant enough to answer some security questions, so that I could set up online banking for her and recurring payments to her facility. I had to race back home yesterday to tackle a bunch of homework and was pretty disappointed that I couldn't finish getting her any identification and that it'll have to wait until my sister gets into town next month. Then I realized that if I was drinking, I probably wouldn't have even gotten her living/care situation figured out. I probably would have drank the first night, to deal with all the stress I'm under, and felt too shitty to accomplish anything. By not drinking, I was able to be there for one of the most important people in my life and do right by them. With that, I just want to thank this community for all that it does. Not drinking has brought immeasurable value back to my life and this community has definitely helped me, and countless others, in times when we might turn back to booze. So, again, thank you and IWNDWYT.",10

I haven't felt worse in my entire life.,"I'm 28, got clean from heroin and benzos 7 years ago. Haven't touched an opiate since then. I started Suboxone after that for a couple years thinking I was living the sober life. Once I tapered off of it I realized that the subs were the ONLY thing giving me energy and hope that entire time. My life went to shit really fast. 

I started taking Kratom in 2015. Two weeks into those horrible Suboxone withdrawals that weren't getting better. It gave me energy again and wasn't as heavy as subs, but I knew I was growing very dependant on it. There was a big thing where it almost got banned federally and I got scared and went back to the subs in 2017. Those were the two most successful years of my life. 

With the subs came the benzos and I did the combo until early this year. Got clean, but started to have a few beers after work. I've always been a drinker, but I could easily stop. By April I was taking benzos again because the couple beers just weren't doing it. By May I switched to liquor and started drinking 10-20 nips per day. Then I started drinking during work. Then I got fired. Entered detox last month on the 23rd.

I got 11 days out and I've barely left my bed in that time. I'm taking a bunch of vitamins that were prescribed and Antabuse which I stopped yesterday because my family cooks a lot with Alcohol and I want to at least enjoy food if I can't have booze. Getting the Naltrexone shot tomorrow.

I feel absolutely fucked. My mind is craving a drink so incredibly bad. My bones hurt, my muscles and nerves hurt, I'm constantly freezing cold, constantly covered in goosebumps, not one lick of energy or motivation. I just feel so absolutely defeated right now even though I'm sober. I envy what I read about people feeling so much better after a a little bit. I feel the opposite. I wish I could go for a run or something, but I can't physically do it. I feel like I drank a liter of whiskey everyday when I wake up. I'm going to a SOAP program daily and open up there, but I still don't feel any better at all. My first drink was 15 years ago this month at age 13. I don't think I've been sober since then.

Edit 7 hours later: Went to my nieces birthday party today. I only stayed an hour because all my friends and family were drinking. I felt so out of place. Ended up making an excuse and got the fuck out of there. It was like everywhere I looked people were talking about the special margaritas that was made and having pumpkin beer with a Cinnamon rim. At the party last year I was drinking with all the same people. Only had a few drinks too. Everyone asked me how I was doing after getting out of detox and I just felt damn embarrassed. I felt extremely claustrophobic and anxious. I'm definitely not ready for that yet. I wish I could have been there to see my beautiful niece. She lives 4 hours away now and I don't get to see her too often. She adores me and I adore her. Just another reason to stay sober. 

Went home and laid in bed for a little bit and then I said fuck it and walked around town for an hour by myself. Feel a little bit better now mentally and physically.",8

I carved the turkey, and more importantly I stuck to my NA beers and San Pellegrino Blood Orange (delicious by the way) all night, while surrounded by my loved ones who were all boozing relatively hard.

If you asked me a couple years ago, I’d say that is not possible and I’d probably tell you to F off or something lol. Now, I’m enjoying my morning and watching football, cleaning my apartment up and heading to the gym soon. My mom is a very happy camper. Life is good.

Part of that was binge eating to cope with the cravings. The antipsychotic meds also didn't help with food cravings. 

I finally decided to take charge. I have to lose weight or my blood pressure will continue to rise and risk of diabetes as well. Besides that, my digestive system is already a mess.

After feeling constant pain in my side, bloating, and colds that wouldn't go away, I realized it was time to lose weight for real.

I count calories now, and I was so surprised to find out how many there are in a shot of Vodka. Who wants to waste empty calories on something that make you crave more empty calories? So while I always had the goal to lose weight, I've done away with justifying drinking to curb the eating cravings.

It's been a few weeks and I'm glad I finally found the solution for me. I've tried AA, antabuse, and naltrexone. If that works for you, great. For me, nothing would work until I had a long term goal and did not allow ""cheating"".",12

Every time I get together with them, it's a big drinking fest. I had previously told them I was just taking a prolonged break from drinking to quit smoking. I tried telling them last night I was really enjoying not drinking and didn't know if I would pick it up again and they would not accept that. ""I hate to break it to you, but you're going to have to start again."" Um, no I'm not. So I laid it all out there. It was emotional at times, but I told them the truth. My truth. They were surprisingly supportive and it was the most liberating feeling. I thought I would wake up this morning full of regret (like after a night of drinking) about what I said, but I still feel really good about it. I was not met with shame over my admission to them, so I'm starting to feel like maybe I can be a little more open with people about my sobriety.

I made an appointment to see the doctor, finally got in to speak with him on the 7th of October. I was quite proud, I laid it out that I have a drinking problem. I was very nervous about his response, but he was very professional. I laid it out the amount that I was drinking, 6 to 8 beers per day every day with 12 to 14 on Friday, Saturday or any holiday. I asked to be placed on naltrexone. I started on wednesday the 9th and haven't had a drink since.

I figured it wouldn't be too bad during the week, friday and saturday are always my triggers with relatives at their place while the kids run around (I know, what a wonderful example for the kids). I made it through with out a drop, without the desire for alcohol. I was very nervous about this, but it was kind of ok the issue wasn't push the issue. Hopefully as time goes on, it will be accepted.

I have been drinking for about 28 years or so (I didn't realize that long till I crunched the numbers). It started out only on weekends and maybe a few beers. In the last few years it has escalated to the point where I was concerned. This past year I really noticed the problem behavior. I would be fuzzy or hung over most of the time - I never missed work because of it, in fact I have had some serious success and promotions at work - I still had a problem. 

The last 6 months have been the eye opener for me. The day before my birthday I had a full case of beer (24 bottles). I woke up on my birthday with a terrible hangover and only 8 bottles left. I had finished off 16 bottles by myself - far more than ""normal"". I had to get another case, it wouldn't be my birthday without it, I killed that one too.

The booze consumption itself, wasn't really what prompted me to seek help. It was the way I was treating my wife and family - I was a huge asshole that would lose my temper at the drop of a hat over anything. When I lost my temper it would take quite a while to calm down and this involved booze. This is what had to change. I couldn't go on like that. She didn't know why I wanted to see the doctor. I told her the problem that I had and why I went after the visit. She was a bit shocked. I don't think she realized (denial?) how much of a problem I had. So I have her support.

So here I am, with something to be very thankful for. I know it is only 4 days, but things are already much better. I am much nicer to my wife and things are actually getting happier - I had forgotten what that feels like. I am sleeping much better. I also enjoy waking up and being able to do something more complex than making tea in the morning. My mind is clearer than it has been in years.

I have a big business trip in November. I am traveling to Belgium, Germany and Sweden. I was looking forward to Belgium to have some of the best beer in the world, I am sad that I won't get to have some, but I would rather remain sober. At least I can replace the beer with some nice Belgian hot chocolates. If anybody has any recommendations about handling a trip like this - I am all ears. 

Thinking about that trip, I realized how much my business trips have revolved around booze and booze related destinations (I normally don't have a choice where I am traveling too, I just make the most of it). An expense account can be problematic. 

Thankfully in the last 20 years, the attitudes towards drinking have changed quite a bit. I was in Australia last year and was quite disappointed with the young engineers I was working with that they didn't want to go out for a few drinks (my few drinks was 8 or 9). I have noticed that trend in a lot of areas of the world with the younger people. This should make it easier to abstain.

Sorry for the long winded post, but I think putting my stake in the sand, so to speak, will make me accountable. I have tried quitting in the past, but no one knew. Now, my doctor knows, my wife knows and reddit knows (this isn't a throwaway account).",6

2019-10-13 10:04:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dhazhk/21_days/,21 Days!,"As of today, I am 3 weeks free of alcohol and marijuana. I’ve been doing an outpatient detox (and now partial care) the whole time which has really helped me not only safely detox but also kept me accountable (pee tests). I’ve been to an AA meeting almost every day the last week to help build my sober network for when my “training wheels” are taken off (not giving urine samples everyday). This is my first time seeking medical help for my addiction and I was lucky to find a great place near my house. 

I honestly haven’t had a serious craving for alcohol the whole time but weed has been calling my name more than I’d like, but that’s for a different sub. I think it’s because I am realize how much havoc alcohol caused in my life so right now I have no desire to drink. I know (from trying to quit before on my own) that eventually the craving for alcohol will creep in so I’m trying to combat that by learning coping mechanisms and building a supporting sober network. Last night I even got a sponsor! 

I was very apprehensive to go to an AA meeting at first but I know that when I’ve tried to quit before, eventually I caved because of lack of support. I remember relapsing last time (after only about a month) and literally part of me thinking I wish I had someone to call to help talk me down (not my family or friends since I felt like I’d be burdening them more with my problem). The other part of my addicted brain obviously won and I was back in the horrible cycle. 

I’m so grateful for the help I’ve received medically and emotionally because I know that I can’t do it in my own. Also, in my downtime this sub is great for reading stories that I can relate to and seeing so many other people fighting the good fight. While everyone has their unique circumstances, I highly recommend finding some in-person support if possible. It’s out there, you just have to humble yourself enough to ask for help.

My brain still feels like mush sometimes and I know it takes a while for our bodies to recover from constantly poisoning ourselves. But I am so, so grateful for kind, supporting people both online and in person and for hearing the stories posted here. 

From my experience, I can’t rely on my own self control because alcohol screws up my decision-making skills and reels me back in physically and emotionally. You can call it an “addictive personality” or simply using it to cope with things you don’t want to deal with in your life. My problems didn’t magically go away though; alcohol made them worse. 

Sorry for the long post but I just wanted to get this out there to this community which has really helped me. I won’t go into my war stories of how bad I was but just want to say: If you want to quit, you can. It’s your choice not to drink and sometimes that choice needs a gentle nudge from an outside source. Thanks for reading and IWNDWYT.",10

I know I need help and have been in therapy since April and it has helped me gain a lot of clarity. But then I go home and deal with my emotions by not dealing with them.

I caught it in the early stages. After about 10 years of drinking. I felt it was getting out of control in the last few years. Peaking right before I took the decision to stop. Alcoholism runs in my family. But denial also runs. It's just so easy to convince oneself that there is no problem with how we perceive alcohol.

At first, it was hard. I was all by myself. Had to beg my flatmate to hide his bottles because I did not trust myself with it. I was obsessing. I stopped going out, stopped meeting with people to avoid temptation. I am so glad this subreddit exists, because it got me through a lot of the pain and struggle. Not feeling alone is so important. Thanks to all of you for that!

Six weeks ago, I attended a medieval festival in my town. Its a yearly event and there is a lot of alcohol. Honey beer and mead, mostly. All the things I love. I was worried for a while before the event, that the trigger would be too big and I would just abandon. I was so close to hitting the one year though.

I ended up not failing. I smelled some mead in one of my friend's glasses. It smelled bad. First little victory. When everybody got beer, I tried out all the alcohol free drinks that were available there: unfiltered apple juice, raspberry juice, elderflower juice and hot red berries juice. I had a blast. All those flavours were amazing and I would never had tasted them if I was still drinking. Also, instead of one type of beer, I got to enjoy 4 different kind of delicious drinks.

And best of all, I was sober. Did not wake up with a headache. Did not start saying silly things. Did not have regrets afterwards.

I didn't think of myself as a constant drinker, and I did regularly go a few days or a week in between, but looking back through my phone gallery history it's just me with a wine or beer glass over and over again. Once I had that first glass it would set something off in me and I would usually just kind of keep going until the day was over (or there was no more to be found and I couldn't acquire more).

The biggest change for me is when I wake up every morning. I rarely got bad hangovers (to a really silly extent actually) but almost every time I drank, the first thing I would be aware of when I woke up the next morning was this intense feeling of sadness, like a grief almost. This was even if I only had a couple glasses of wine. I've only had that feeling once since quitting, which is incredible because I'm going through a *terrible* time in my life right now (laid off, had exciting school plans fall through, major social and family changes due to leaving my old religion, health issues, and a nice depressive episode to boot). I also love that I'm always in control of what I say and do. Sometimes I say and do dumb things and have to apologize to people, but it's so much more freeing to say ""I'm sorry I said x, that was a bad choice and I'll watch myself from now on"" than to have to say ""I'm sorry, I was drunk."" 

Already thinking of keeping this up long-term. I'm not sure I'm the type who can do the whole ""moderation"" thing, and I am just really glad that I'm catching this problem early on before it has any serious impacts on my life.",8

I've dated in the past and probably through drinking have chosen the wrong people or have not set a good impression with my drinking. Anyway I've decided to have time out a while ago but still carried on drinking at home. I stopped drinking tail end of july and I'm doing great. Yesterday there was an opportunity to flirt with a guy. But i held back as i had been told he liked his drink. Maybe not a problem drinker but he liked his wine. I just know I cant go there. Not for fear of being tempted but because I really dont want to be in a lifestyle around dinners and wine. I do still want to go out but also want to do things that don't evolve around the bottle. So I'm choosing to stay single for a while longer and keep working on me. This is my time. IWNDWYT,10

Otherwise that dissatisfaction and anger and anxiety and self-pity that used to make up my thoughts can creep right back in. 

I’ve got to admit that not every day has been easy or happy. Hell some days have been fucking tough, bloody miserable. But some days have been extremely satisfying and plenty joyous. 

If I look back I realise that stopping drinking didn’t really change much in my life. The changes I have made since including daily exercise, meditation, eating better, reading more, weekly budgeting, learning to be more reflective and less reactive were only possible because I got sober. Remembering that recovery is a continual process and what you give back and give to others is the best thing you get. 

Like I say it wasn’t easy, I’ve basically had to renovate myself from top to bottom, and I’ve changed a lot of people, places and things in my life - you can’t get well in the same environment that made you sick - and hell I’m not perfect but I’m 497 sober days better than I used to be.

My Dad wanted a shirt before the concert and we wanted to get some food. So we split up. We walked My Mom to the end of the shirt line and the woman who got behind her said ""are y'all going to get drinks"" to me and my Dad. My Dad (not an alcoholic) said "" yeah do want anything?"" My Dad is just like that. He will literally give someone the shirt off his back. She said ""can I get a Michelob?"" My Dad replied ""I got you!"" My Dad and I set off for food and drinks. When we got to the food stand they only had Budweiser. So we ordered our food and 3 waters (my Mom has 28 years sober and my Dad doesn't really drink.) While we waited on the food my Dad asked me if I felt comfortable going to get a Michelob for the lady or if I wanted to get the food. I said I'd go get the beer. I tracked down a vendor got the beer. Went to the shirt line. Found my Mom tapped the lady on the shoulder. I said to her "" is it you? Yes! It's you! Here ya go!"" We hugged and parted ways. It was crazy I didn't even want it.

She has 4 beautiful young kids and literally lives the perfect life. She married a wealthy man and doesn't have to work. She's ruining this perfect life with alcohol and doesn't see it.

Very recently she even mentioned getting help and yet she is still buying big wine bottles that she hides in the back of the lower cabinet. She has 5 or 6 and I guess they are just there as back as because she buys the smaller wine bottles as well that she mostly drinks out of. 

I've recently started talking to friends about her when previously it was something that wasn't talked about. It feels better getting some of my worries off my chest. I spoke with a mentor of mine and found out that her sister died from liver failure brought on by alcoholism. I'm wondering if I should somehow bring this up with my sister in conversation.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I hit six months sober recently. I was never an every-day drinker, but I got my money's worth on the 2-3 days a week I did drink. My health was suffering. My depression was constant. And I was so very tired of waking up around 3 a.m. after a night of drinking, going through ""the questions."" 

What did I do last night? Who did I talk to? What did I say? What do I have to fix? Why do I keep doing this? 

I got so extremely tired of that. 

Is my life perfect now? Of course not. But I seem to be creating fewer problems for myself and I'm actually fixing a few too! I've lost 65 pounds in that time, exercised at least 30 minutes every day for six months straight, regained some self-esteem, reconnected with some old friends, accomplished a lot on my ""to do"" list. Work seems easier. Life seems easier. 

How was I able to quit? I just reached a point where I realized drinking wasn't solving a thing for me and actually creating more problems. That 3-4 hours of stress relief was really just stress postponement, and meanwhile the stressors were mounting all around me. I'd tried to quit several times but rarely made it a whole week. There was always something that pissed me off (solved by drinking, of course) or something to celebrate (celebrated by drinking, of course!)

AA was never for me. I'm an atheist and the ""higher power"" thing was going to be a stumbling block. This isn't a knock on the program, or anyone it works for, or religion in general. It just wasn't for me, because I think the most important thing about quitting is being really, truly honest with yourself, so creating a workaround on the higher power thing to me always felt phony.

Another thing that kept me from quitting before is I imagined my life would be roughly the same, except I'd be depriving myself of alcohol. Is sobriety really some amazing awakening? No, it wasn't an elixir that solved everything. But like I said, I've quit adding to my list of problems in my life, and I've started making positive progress. That feels really good. It's not the super high feeling you get for that magic 30 minutes when the buzz starts, but it's more lasting and it's a hell of a lot more real. My life no longer feels like something I want to escape by using alcohol.

I decided to post because taking little pieces out of other people's posts who were succeeding really did help me get to six months and a new mindset. I hope I gave one person one little thing that sticks in their head that helps them. IWNDWYT.",10

My dad in recent years has gradually become a heavier and heavier drinker and I never noticed until tonight how bad it has gotten. This is probably because in the past whenever I came home for a holiday get together I was right there wasted with him. It was cringe to say the least. 

When we arrive he offers me a beer which I politely decline and he proceeds to call me a wuss. Typical. As the evening progresses it gets worse as he pokes wickedly inappropriate fun at my s/o. Also typical. He proceeds to pick fights with my stepmom who just rolls her eyes and brushes him off. Again, typical. The rest of the family begins to arrive and he drunkenly spews nonsense, just talking shit about people we are all familiar with. He injects himself into genuine conversations with no context just to say something irrelevant causing it to abruptly end, leaving everyone annoyed. Still, typical. We left before the next stage, where he gets all emotional and cries about passed relatives or some other family drama. 

At first I was really anxious because I  (for the first time since I quit drinking) was feeling ""triggered"". Like I really thought I wanted to drink this evening but I am so thankful I didn't! I feel embarassed for my dad (who has no shame) and myself having behaved the same way countless times before. I don't want to be like that. Ever. 

I am thankful this year for my incredible boyfriend who is so supportive and has put up with too much. I am thankful for this sub and all of your stories and the way this community supports one another.

It wasn’t ‘deep and profound’, but I was straightforward in the sense that I said I don’t do well with alcohol and so I have given it up. It was nice to share a bit.

I am really starting to feel the effects of having more energy and clarity. I am starting to mentally take note of things I want to work towards that are only for me.

I had tried Naltrexone, Baclofen, and kratom by itself previously, without success. I also had done a 1 week inpatient detox a few years ago, followed by about 3 weeks of sobriety where I felt constantly tempted.

Anyway, here's what finally worked:

I bought Chris Scott's book - ""Drinking Sucks"", as well as his 6 week coaching program from fit-recovery.com. Bought all the supplements he recommends, and started a taper of 1 oz per day. It wasn't entirely smooth, but I set a date of my birthday to be ""zero day"", and checked in with Chris daily via text message. 

Also I'm in a state where recreational marijuana is legal. I used the supplements as well as Kratom and CBD:THC vape (3:1 since it tends to give me anxiety) to quit. I also bought lots of kombucha (non or very very low alcohol) and drank that instead. It kind of fills the void. 

Also began going to the gym daily after work to sort of ""crowd out"" the time I usually spent drinking and watching TV in the evenings. 

There were no withdrawals and only a mild sense of depression for the first week or so after quitting. 

I guess I'm posting this in case it might help anyone else who is thinking of quitting and curious about utilizing supplementation and/or kratom/THC as tools. Feel free to ask any questions and I will try to get back to all.

As for the kratom and THC, I am still using both daily. Haven't decided yet if/when I want to phase those out. I'm not very fond of the THC as it still tends to give me a little anxiety, but it does help ""change your state"" of mind and eliminate any alcohol cravings. The kratom I do enjoy more, but it has significantly decreased my libido (or at least I think that's what's doing it). I'm single at the moment, so not a big deal, but will probably look to eventually make that a much more occasional treat.

Bonus: I also started keto diet at the same time and the extra weight I was carrying is dropping off very nicely/quickly!",66

As I read the posts and comments on this page I find myself feeling frustrated and sad for these people. I read about how diligently they measure and count their alcohol. For a select few (maybe 4-5 people), it works. But for the vast majority, it fails miserably every time. I understand what they are going through. It was so hard for me to admit that alcohol was something I just couldn’t control so I spent years trying to moderate it. 

Some may wonder why I still bother to follow this page. I still follow it because I know how my brain works and I know that the thought of moderation will eventually creep up. All it takes is a quick perusal of this FB group and I am very quickly reminded that it just won’t work. I really do hope the best for all members of this group and if they are able to find success with moderation, I think that’s great. The sad truth is that many of them will spend years wasting their time trying to do so instead of going all in with sobriety and enjoying life to the fullest

I was just your typical weekend binge drinker. Although this past year I was drinking quite heavily after my breakup with my significant other. I've been sober off nicotine and alcohol for the past 25 days. Overall I feel ok and I feel like I'm on the right path. But honestly I get this crazy urge to have a drink and vape again. My brain tries to rationalize that I could probably have a few drinks and vape and then not do it for a while. But I don't think that will be the reality. Last year I went 90 days without alcohol and I felt pretty fucking great towards the end. I did start drinking again after the 90 days, but I ended up binge drinking again soon after because of the breakup with my ex. 

 I guess I'm also dealing with social isolation as well since I live by myself and I have a bad relationship with my family plus my father was an alcoholic. My social circle does not help because my friends literally tell me they don't think I have a problem and what's the harm with having a couple of drinks. I feel like it's agony trying to be a tee toller. 

I think I'm happy without alcohol, but sometimes after so many years of being socialized to use it, I feel like it should be no big deal to have a drink. Like I wish I could have a drink or two and just relax.

Are there resources online where I can find a sober accountability buddy or something? Mind you I still partake in certain things like marijuana because I dont abuse other substances like I did with alcohol.",4

Proud to say I made it through all three! The airport and flights were very tempting, but I was late getting to the airport on both flights which deflected my boredom drinking mechanism. When we scheduled dinner at a brewery, I was a little concerned about wanting to have a few beers, but playing the tape forward helped considerably as many of you suggested.

Day ten now, and I'm feeling good but a little concerned about getting past day 30, which is always where I seem to falter.

I started out on the 3rd, and the end of the month marks my anniversary that we set aside some wine for a while back. I don't want one day to be a slip up that puts me down a rabbit hole again. And then we go into Thanksgiving, Christmas, New year's and they're all filled with booze every time. I know I need to just stick to my convictions and keep playing the tape forward, but it's going to be a struggle. Even got a bit of a hard time the other night for not wanting to have a drink with dinner after having said I wanted to stay away from it for a bit while I get settled into the new job, so I know there's just going to be more pressure as the end of the year turns around.

2019-10-12 12:38:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dgxho3/6_months_sober/,6 months sober!,"My last drink was April 11, after an initial 10 day streak reset when I finally accepted that buying a six-pack and “just having a couple” really meant “drinking a six pack”.  I’d been a fairly regular drinker for 25 years (I am 50) and this is by far the longest streak (and I have no intention to relapse at this point!).  On average the final couple years I was pretty much drinking daily, probably between 3 and 6 drinks, depending on what was going on for family activities or social events.  Probably a bit more on weekends and holidays.

It has been a crazy six months, though.  Starting only two weeks after I quit, I ended up in hospital for kidney stones, then a massive GI bleed due to an undiagnosed ulcer.  The ulcer was no doubt partially caused by alcohol, but also by NSAIDS (careful with your ibuprofen consumption, folks) as well as poorly managed acid reflux.

The ulcer led to further investigations, pancreatitis from one of the endoscopic procedures, and after that diagnostic, it turns out I have Stage 4 bile duct cancer.  I haven’t found a strong link between alcohol and cholangiocarcinoma but I’m sure that it
must have played some role in it.

During my times in hospital it was easy to avoid drinking, but while at home for the first few months this forum has been amazing for support, as I read about everyone’s triumphs and defeats.  The level of support everyone has for one another - all of us anonymous strangers but with a common disease - is incredibly inspiring.

I’m taking a positive, optimistic, but pragmatic view on my cancer.  I had a full “Whipple procedure” to try to excise the tumour completely but it wasn’t totally successful, and I’ll be starting chemo in a few weeks.

Occasionally I think about a few beers as a brief respite for the existential angst that comes with having a serious disease, but this forum certainly serves as a reminder that the respite is very brief, and will be followed by regret and heightened anxiety... so no thanks!

Anyways, thanks to all of you for your support, whether it was direct or indirect.  You are all inspiring to me and I wish you all the best on your journey of sobriety.

I'd wake up aching and exhausted from not getting any real quality of sleep, and I was isolating myself even on the rare days I didn't drink for fear of being found out.

Even without a drink in my hand, even when I wasn't actively in pain or doing something stupid it was still controlling almost everything I did. It's a horrifying thing to confront.

There is still this niggling thought, though, that I don't know how long it will last and that maybe one day I'll be well enough to drink again or I'll slip up soon. 
I'm trying not to see having the thought as a weakness, just another aspect of the idea that we are never really 'cured' and that recovery is an ongoing process. It is frightening, though. Any thoughts anyone has on that would be interesting to read.

I had quit smoking a month and a half before and thought, fuck it, if I can cold turkey smoking without much issue, this beast can be taken down as well.

So I stopped. 

This sub was the best resource for me and still is. I don't post as much as I used to but I still read all the time. I have seen this place grow from about 15,000 subs to the beast it is now and its great to see so many people coming to the conclusion that they need to stop tossing this poison down their throats.

For me, I used to use the booze to medicate. Specifically anxiety. I always see the posts about people's anxiety going away after they quit because it was caused by their drinking. However, with me, the drinking was the pause button for my anxiety, its how I treated it. So after I stopped, I realized the extent of my anxiety/OCD which I am now working through. Long road ahead and all that jazz.

I'm not looking for any relationship advice here, just giving context.

On a semi-related note, I haven't been to this community in a few weeks but I'm almost to 50 days! This place helped me so so much during the initial segment. I really cannot believe that I've made it this far, and every day sober I find more and more to be grateful for.",7

-telling people that I quit (vs. taking a break etc.) helped a lot

-emotions are real. It turns out therapy works a lot better when you don’t try to escape from all your emotions with booze and tv.

-I still have anxiety, but I feel so much better knowing for sure it’s not cause I did something stupid while drinking.

-I got way better at setting boundaries and being assertive.

-I had a lot of trouble sleeping. About 45 days in I just couldn’t get to sleep. I’m working on a routine now to help with that.


I had really high expectations for sobriety. I’m learning that while taking booze out of the equation is a HUGE step in the right direction, it doesn’t magically solve all of my problems. I didn’t lose a ton of weight, in fact I’m craving sugar for the first time in my life. I’m not saving a bunch of money because I still find things to spend it on. But, the important thing is that I am much healthier and I’m learning so much about myself. I still have a lot of goals for my sober self, but I’m trying to be patient and kind to myself as well.

I’m a lawyer working in a financial services area so contacts like this guy are important for business development. Also - I’ve only been in my current job a few months, but this partner has never invited me out before. He and the other associate were in the same frat, and I’m a woman, so it seemed pretty likely I would be shut out of the good old boy network.

I didn’t want to fuck it up once I got the invite. 

I started rationalizing. I was getting sick - my first cold since getting sober. Scotch always helps. I previously got by in settings like this by drinking “manlier” scotch than anyone else (super smokey, petey). I figured, since I was sick, I could have just one scotch and call it medicine. 

But I didn’t. I had tonic water and cranberry and didn’t feel weird. The waitress was awesome - I think she’s either sober or assumed as a young woman alone with three dudes I was just being safe. That’s good to know, because I may get fewer questions because of that. I hadn’t thought of it before. 

I then went through the rest of my miserable cold with only virgin hot toddies. And it was fine. And now I’m fine. And still sober. IWNDWYT.",16

Long time lurker, first time poster (28/m) Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've always a ""doesn't know when to stop"" in terms of drinking and what began as recreational drug use. I've gotten myself into dangerous situations and was previously a full blown functioning addict having to make up lies and stories in order to cover my tracks and behaviour.

There would be times when I would be fine and not drinking or anything else then I would fall into a deep hole of reckless behaviour. I was wasting all my money and having to borrow off my fiancee who god bless him is still with me and stuck completely by me as I battled my demons. 

During the week I went out with work and then left that party and I could have easily gone home but I stayed out all night and spent money I didn't have and got completely fucked up. That stops here. I have a great job and great family and an amazing fiancee - addiction does not discriminate but I have more to live for then wine and cocaine.

I'm grateful for a subreddit like this where I can come check in and see there are other people out there just like me suffering.

So thank you all - it's day 1. Here we go and IWNDWYT!",14

I saw two people get carried out, one before 9 PM, and the other got a bloody nose. Also saw another person passed out in the street. Drinks got spilled everywhere. I didn’t realize how much being sober really opens your eyes to how sloppy and annoying people can be when they’re drunk. Last night I was glad I wasn’t one of them. I still managed to have a good time. 

I want to thank everyone here for sharing their stories. You’re part of the reason why I got some guts and hopped on the sober train for a bit.

I start thinking about my ex and how disgusting I was (as in, demons from the relationship that I haven’t shared with anyone, ever); all the little things about my personality that I hate; feeling like I’ve amounted to very little with a worthless college degree and full time retail position; feeling like I’m going nowhere.

I have found that to help with sleeping, I limit myself to 1 sugarfree redbull (small can) a day.  Usually drink it before 10 am.  No caffeine after that.  I drink sugar free or regular sprite.

Small triggers, just avoid them.

My almost 17yr old daughter, is a typical teenager I guess.  I see a lot of myself in her.  Its scary.  That was my main inspiration to quit.  She is a junior this year.  
I remember when I was a junior in high school, I dropped out halfway thru it.  I was drinking, smoking weed, acid, whatever prescription pills i could get my hands on, mostly pain meds.  I am thankful she is not where I was at.  She is no saint, but much better than me.  I just dont want look back when I am 58, see her a grown woman, struggle with substance abuse.  In order for me to break the  cycle, she has to see the change in me.  I have to prove to her even the most stubborn people can change.  
Thanks to me, she has seen the bad effects of alcoholism.  I mean, it hurts to say this, she has only seen short glimpses of me sober.  I wasnt falling down drunk, but if it was after 5, or a weekend, more times than not, I had at least 1 drink.

Errands and grocery shopping on a busy Friday afternoon,  with lines halfway back to the produce section and the friendliest cashier who likes to have long chats with every customer.  A rushed frozen pizza dinner so chores can get done and showers can be had and animals fed and another outburst from the teen because I ""just don't understand ANYTHING!"" with a slammed door for good measure.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Food and behaviors/releases around it were my first addiction.
When recovering from my eating disorder about 10 years ago, I had to learn how to moderate my relationship with food.  Anyone who has survived this disorder tells you its never 100% gone and this is true for me.

This is making it very difficult to convince myself I can't moderate my drinking.  My self destructive brain is telling me if I can do it with food, which you literally cannot abstain from in order to live, you can do it with alcohol.

I've drank less this year than I have for YEARS cumulatively.  I go on streaks that are pretty sizable (to me, I'm on day 13 now and my last streak was something in the 70s), but if I want to drink and the occasion is ""safe"" I allow it... kind of like I do with dessert or foods that scare me.

In an ideal world I think I'd like to stop drinking completely if for no other reason than it makes me look like shit.  The reality is even though I don't drink OFTEN anymore, when I do it still puts me in not great situations.  But I've kind of proven I *can* moderate to an extent.  I'm not really sure what I am looking for by posting here, but has anyone dealt with this concept? 

I'm fully aware there are lots of mental gymnastics here and I'm just trying to land a back handspring to get over it.  Thanks.",2

I thought I’d share this with everyone. 

My wife dragged me to the doctor’s for help. In Singapore we do have a medical centre that focuses on mental illnesses and they have a department that deals with addictions (drugs, alcohol, gambling, sex, etc.)

I was paired with a counsellor who had a lowdown on what was going on in my life and he worked through some of the issues with me. One of the questions he asked me that struck me and got me dumbfounded was;

“Do you have any hobbies/do you do anything to blow off steam?” 

I realised the last 5-6 years my life has pretty much been, dysfunctional family drama, work work work, study study study, the occasional vacation, and then back to the grind. I stopped Muay Thai, I stopped going to the gym (slipped discs), I stopped playing video games. I stone in front of the tv after work and that’s it. So I turned to alcohol to blow off steam. It became my hobby and my friend. 

I’ve been trying to slow down my life more now. Take the occasional off day to stay home and spend time my baby girl, read, and relax. 

On top of counselling, the doctor who attended to me also prescribed Naltrexone to me. It’s an opioid inhibitor that helps with the urge to drink. It’s not for everyone. I struggled with it for a month or so because the side effects are plenty - you get fatigue, nausea, giddiness, loss of appetite, etc. It doesn’t promote abstinence, it just helps to curb the urge to drink. 

(Just for kicks, I did try to drink a large can of beer while on naltrexone. Half way through the can, my brain was telling me, what the hell are you drinking; ewwwwwww) 

I plan to finish this treatment and then go for physio to fix my back; and then get back to the gym. 

Anyway. 

42 days sober and trooping on. No guts no glory. Let’s do this.


On a related note, there are two levels of medications I've heard of that's being prescribed. One is naltrexone, as I've stated above, and the other which is for more serious cases is disulfram. Both require a chaperone. You will need a family member or a friend involved, because these drugs are dangerous, especially disulfram. Naltrexone blocks opioid receptors so if I'm wheeled into emergency and I need painkillers, morphine or opioid based pain killers are essentially useless. Then again, opioid based medications are really really rare in Singapore and they're mostly used for end stage/terminally ill people.",18

Hope you are well,

But all jokes aside, it's nice to have spent it sober. I went out with my mum, Shopping, Went for a meal, Chilled back at mine etc. It was nice, We havn't done anything like that in years and the main reason is because I can no go day to day without worrying about where my next drink is going to come from.  A good feeling, I can't remember the last birthday I had sober, probably about 10 years ago.

My boyfriend makes good decisions when he's drinking. Always having a few wines and booking tickets to Fiji or movie tickets or just making fun plans and I love it. 

So on the spot he booked tickets and we got jazzed for this 'gig' we assumed it was an electronic music show - fast forward to about a week ago, friend asks me if we've got our costumes sorted as its 'Under The Sea' themed (ahhh yes I remember briefly her telling me that it was fancy dress, but I was drunk and forgot the next day) 

We had a laugh, spent the week riffing ideas off one another and trying to see what we could come up with (we're pretty lazy and don't want to spend too much money on elaborate costumes to only wear for one night) 

Last night I decided to google it and see if there was pictures from the groups other gigs and we stumbled across a video, THE VIDEO LOOKED LIKE AN ABSOLUTE ACID TRIP. The costumes were absolutely INCREDIBLE and OUTRAGEOUS but we were in shock. 

Turns out we've agreed to go to a psychedelic dance party and we are super unprepared. I'm pretty outgoing and bubbly and I will enjoy all the distractions of the costumes and glitter while enjoying my NA bevvies. 

My boyfriend is pretty shy and reserved, doesn't really like to dress up and feels self conscious wearing anything other than his tshirt and jeans with the occasional jacket so this will be an absolute scream. However he is not like me and doesn't feel the need to drink in order to make himself more comfortable in unusual social situations. Neither of us really take recreational drugs or the kind of drugs you'd expect to find at a psychedelic dance party so this will be interesting.

Can't wait for the new sober experience. I'm really looking forward to having this memory forever because I think it will be a good one.

I started blacking out again, treating my fiancée poorly and starting arguments that would lead to the cops knocking on our door because of noise complaints.. I saw in his eyes today how sad and hurt he was.. The thing that killed me the most was that last night I blacked out, again, and woke up to him leaving. I didn’t remember a thing, he informed me that I came home and started yelling at him- he didn’t have a choice but to leave.

First Reddit post here. I have been following this subreddit and others related to sober life. I also have been in and out of AA for 2 years, read many books about quitting alcohol, love autobiographies about celebrities who are happy in recovery.

However I can never seem to get a few months under my belt (once 6 and once 9). The relapses that followed were my personal best (worst). I have found my relapses aren't as bad when I am sort of drinking on and off. So I guess they're not relapses, more 2 day binges with no obvious external consequences.

I used to swear by AA, here in the UK it's less dogmatic perhaps than in the US (from what I read anyway). However I still can't muster up the same enthiasm towards meetings and doing fellowship and steps. I always lose motivation after a couple of months.

I don't know what I'm trying to say really, but am I just in denial to think I can try and keep alcohol in my life? Is this a place I can come to try and control or will I be laughed at. I know from the title it says 'those who want to control also', but I feel that is just 'gateswideopen' and really there will be judgement.",2

This time I'm kind of recovering from months of excuses to drink to the point where I was drinking every night after work and binging on weekends and I knew I needed to quit for a while, or longer. I'm trying to get pregnant so I kept feeling like ""party it up, you won't get to once the baby is here."" However, we started trying a year ago with no luck. Now I think I need to make my body a better place to grow a baby and maybe that will help. 

I'm 5 days in now, I feel good. I'm cranky though. I went to a concert last night with a group of friends where it's always a drinking occasion when we're together. I knew I wasn't going to drink and had no trouble turning down the numerous offers, but I got so irritated as the night wore on and everyone else got drunk. I was shocked at how much everyone was drinking and that I drink that same way when we're all together. I did not enjoy the show, it was so loud, I didn't dance, I just stood there waiting for it to be over. I felt like an asshole, I was just miserable. I'm a bit depressed as I usually get for a about a week after I quit. I'm scared that this irritability will stay with me though and I'll be unpleasant to be around. I don't mind others drinking. I was frustrated that I knew if I did drink I wouldn't stop. I would have loved to be able to have one or two and that's it. I also hate what my body looks like (I'll admit I'm skinny, always have been, but I have my first slight beer belly and it's making my self-esteem a mess). I drink a lot when I am drinking. 105lbs and I can put back a 6 pack of Jai Alai easily. I don't want that, I want to be 1 drink and done.

I had three years under my belt until about 5 years ago, when I accidentally imbibed -- no, really -- when I had an oyster shooter at a sushi restaurant, and realized after I downed it that there was sakè in it (other oyster shooters I'd had were just oyster and cocktail sauce, so I hadn't expected that.) So then the rationalizations began, again.

""It was only one! See, I *can* handle it! Maybe once in a while isn't so bad!""

Within a year I was back to a bottle or two of wine a day, and sneaking pulls of vodka from the gallon jug in the freezer. (Arrgh. getting the supid Pavlovian response, even now.)

After 3 more years of blotted-out days, lethargy, and putting a percentage of my earnings towards my habit, I decided to stop again. Told myself I'd just try and keep going for as long as I could, and try and forgive myself if I falter.

Thats how I feel all the time lately. I have no energy or enthusiasm to do anything.

Im just venting here but I am so annoyed with myself.

I have been drinking 30+ units per day for 2 years now, up and down, crazy outburts, hurting family and friends, lost 2 jobs as well. Now for the past year I have been going through the drug and alcohol service. In that time Id likke to say ive tried to cut down myself, but in all honesty I haven't. I have had the intention of cutting down, and Ive been advised its only safe to cut down 10% per week, yet once I start drinking I just cant stop.

My family and friends tell me that I can just stop full stop. My keyworker and the doctors tell me that If I do that then I need to be prepared to go to ANE from severe withdrawls, so I have to cut down until I can stop. Every time I try cut down from 30-40 units I may go down to like 20 units but then over the following week it just goes back up.

In january I went to a private rehab for 3 weeks, I could only afford that once. I failed it. I drank straight away afterwards, and even snuck a drink in during on one of the days. I then had an emergency alcohol detox at the hospital a few months ago, but failed that the same day as well. Its been since then that ive been drinking every day.

I lost my job in may thanks to this, and myself, and in august I managed to actually get an amazing job. I couldnt just stop drinking though - and Im not saying that as a statement about ""poor me"", im saying that like ""why the fuck couldn t I just stop drinking, I hate myself, kind of thing"".

It was an incredible job, massive payrise, and I was being flown around the world. But I was still drinking during work, and got caught after 2 months and lost the job instantly.

I wont lie after loosing my dream job, I definitely started drinking even more. 

Now being back at home, I need to be able to pay rent ofcourse and have money for general things, so ive had to get another job. Ive secured one again and start on monday. I cant, cant drink during work again. I cant go through the stress of loosing another job.

Now im at the stage with the NHS where I can get a home detox in about 2-3 weeks, but with starting this job I feel like I need to stop instantly.

Today I woke up and tried not to drink. Normally I drink by 6 am or whenever I wake up sweating and today I went until 11 before getting some. 

I want to stop full stop over the weekend because I know that all this pussyfooting around stopping is really just me not wanting to stop, and at this point I feel im using the fact that I could go into severe withdrawls as an excuse, and my mindset is just all over the place.

Ive put a lot of thought into it but honestly I think I dont want to really stop for the reason I said at the start. Whats the point at this stage. Even if I quit this and never touch any drugs or alcohol again, wheres the fun in that? and for what point, so that I can be under constant pressure to work hard, save, make a family, move out, ect, until I die anyway in about 50 odd years. Im 24 now and given my drinking and smoking and drug addictions, I really dont invision gettin g past the age of 50, let alone 70.

Maybe Im just being depressive because of the alcohol, but I dont know. All i know is every day I feel sick and tired more and more, I never have any enthusiasm or real energy, and Im constantly on the line of not drinking enough or drinking too much. And even if I dont get withdrawls because I havent drunk enough, its almost a reflex to grab my drink every minute or two. 

I dont know what I wanted reallly, theres not really any help I can get because I dont seem to want it. And im already following the prceoss for help from my keyworker, but according to him I have to drink 10% less for the next 2-3 weeks, so maybe 35 units a day all week, then 30 all week, then 27 all week or something, untill I get a home detox, but then Im thinking really? my doctor is actively telling me that I need to continue drinking 35 units per day whilst I am already feeling sick and tired all the time and barely eating, I dont feel like I will survive for the next few weeks continueing.

But then again, ive survived until now. Its just the idea of it to me, and by the time ive drunk 25+ units I start loosing the plot, and generally definately drink more. I dont even know what to think and with all this stress and everything, I really cant be bothered anymore, which brings me again back to the start of this post.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to vent and get somethings of my chest. Please dont leave me hate comments because I know my issues are all my own fault and that Im selfish and a bad person. I know that already so you people dont need to remind me if that was your plan. I just wanted to vent. Thank you",5

The most productive and best years of my life have been the ones where I have been sober, but I oftentimes think am I boring and I need alcohol to be fun and cool.

I know this is not the case but does anyone else feel that way?

Thanks for the support so far SD. This is my first post so I’ll give a little background. 

I decided to quit drinking about a year ago after several years of binge drinking had gotten unmanageable. After a shaky and miserable set of withdrawals I got an addiction counselor and quit for about 5 months. 

I slowly started getting restless after the dust settled and I decided that I’d like to try moderating. I told my counselor that and he ran through a long list of times alcohol had hurt me bad in the past several years, including a DUI, another arrest, getting fired for a BAC test at an old job (I work under the Department of Transportation), failed relationships, a broken leg, etc etc. I went for it anyway. Somehow I was convinced I could manage it and it would be worth it. It wasn’t. 

I still never wanted to have a drink or two, and just about every opportunity I could find to drink I drank and drank too much. It took about three months before it got dangerous again. I had been drinking on and off for three days and stopped at a bar after a work trip. On the way home I hit a parked car and fled, then proceeded to drive very drunk for about an hour before finding my way home to a hysterically worried girlfriend. A DUI would have been career ending. 

Unfortunately this wasn’t enough of a wake up call and the following week I drank again. My girlfriend kicked me out of the house we live in and I promptly booked a hotel right next to a liquor store. I got about 3/4 through a fifth of vodka before my girlfriend called and was so concerned she came and picked me back up to make sure nothing worse happened. 

So it’s day 6 now, and I finally got my wake up call. I went back to the counselor I’d been seeing and he told me that he personally recommended at least Intensive Outpatient Treatment and could no longer see me without my commitment to see an Addiction Specialist MD that he knows well. No more half-assing it. 

Here comes the difficult decision. I’m as committed to sobriety as ever, but entering treatment like this would require disclosure to the DOT. Disclosure would result in a long period of medical certificate suspension and rehabilitation (probably two years) and cost me the dream job offer that I’ve somehow managed to secure during all this. I welcome all the help I can get but I also don’t want to lose my career getting sober. I do fully acknowledge that I would lose it if I continued drinking but I want to find the middle way. 

Anyway I figured this was as good a time as any to introduce myself to SD and say thanks for reading and for all the support over the past year!",17

I thought about and replied to the comments throughout the day yesterday and by the time I got home I really felt like I was on solid footing. 

My first sober night this time around wasn’t nearly as rosy as my other night 1s have been. My partner was working late so I was alone. I watched Shameless, worked on a diamond painting, fed the cats, and did laundry. I was unusually bored, and I realized the only reason I felt that way was because I wasn’t drinking. If I were drinking, my capacity for complex thought would have been diminished enough that these simple boring activities wouldn’t be boring. But there I was, alone with my thoughts, and grateful to realize I’m not just a boring person— alcohol makes me that way. Going forward I’m going to try and do one activity outside of work each day. 

Today I feel calm and clear-headed, and for once I feel no shame. Tonight I’m looking forward to walking around the city I work in before returning home. I’ll grab some la croc and maybe takeout, and when my partner gets home we’ll watch El Camino. And I’ll be able to follow along while watching it and afterward I’ll remember all of it. 

Thank you for welcoming me with open arms, SD. We may be strangers, but I promise not to be a stranger. IWNDWYT.",10

I'm not always a drinker. Sometimes I get cravings, I LIKE the taste of it to my detriment. It didn't used to be unusual after a stressful day at work to open a bottle of wine. After a stressful day of parenting, to have a couple of swigs of some type of strong alcohol to calm my nerves. To get excited that we were seeing THOSE particular people because I knew it meant having (a reason to have) a drink or two (my husband doesn't drink so..)

But then there's the MANY times that I've drank too much, blacked out (or in the case of last Friday been sick in front of the neighbours and had to be taken home), abused my husband (because I can be a horrible drunk) and suffered a horrendous hangover waking up vowing never to drink again.

If I'm out or having a 'few' with a friend, I can't seem to know when enough is enough. As I say, I LIKE the taste of a nice glass of wine, a cheeky prosecco, a dry g&t, a fruity cocktail...I am very much a ""Oh go on then I'll just have another one"" type person/easily led/no resolve. 

After last Friday's debacle I emailed the AA which my husband thought was hilarious as I ""just need to learn not drink too much"" and ""have a bit of self control"" and say ""I won't drink anymore thank you, I'll just have a soft drink""...Great advice in theory. But being as I like the taste, the buzz of being tipsy/drunk, the occasional use as a crutch for stress. Should I just give up all together?! Or do I try and see if I CAN 'control' the amount I drink when it's on tap?! I have a hen do and a wedding coming up. Will either be an excellent chance to go cold turkey or an excellent chance to practise that self control... To drink or NOT to drink, THAT is the question.",8

I have not been involved with anything recovery related during these 8 days and honestly I feel like it has helped take my mind off of drinking. I have been so busy with other things in my personal life that drinking hasn't even really crossed my mind.

I'm usually the depressed and anxious all day kind of person who struggles to get out of bed and drinks at night to escape the boredem and monotony of life.

Now that physically the withdrawals have probably passed I do want to address the mental cravings that come up so I will take a little time to work on my SMART Recovery handbook every day.

I've always been a partier, but now that I'm 28 things have really caught up. Drinking has lead me to weight gain, high levels of anxiety, depression, starting and stopping smoking multiple times. I'm not the type of person that had a drink every single day, but I think drastically lessening my alcohol intake has lead to some great changes over this short time.  Overall I am happier, less anxious, and my overall sense of well-being has greatly increased. I've been focusing more on my diet and exercise which has lead me to losing 12 pounds. I don't look bloated anymore and can finally see part of my abs again. 

I did go out and drink one night. Although it was a fun night, the next day was miserable. I had to drink throughout that day in order to not be a nervous wreck. That feeling is what has powered me through the rest of the 30 days. I wont say that I won't ever have another drink, but I think I will reserve drinking to only a small handful of times throughout the year.",6

It's been quite easy so far...but I'm approaching the ""danger zone"" for me.  My 2019 New Year's resolution was to quit drinking.  And while I've made great strides, I can't claim victory yet.  I've been consistently stringing 10 to 20 sober days together since the beginning of the year.  I'd say it all has averaged out to drinking twice a month.  This is a far cry better than I was doing over the last 10 years when I was binge drinking probably at least twice a week.

I'm determined to get through this month without drinking.  I think 31 days will be very inspiring and motivating for me.  Hopefully enough so that I will keep right on going.

What helped me was lots of tees. I've found this amazing one tasting like licorice which I love, its a digestive tea but I just love the taste sooo much. It's pretty cheap too at lidl (so might sell globally). It does include licorice, anis, some other goodies. 
  
Then it was self made pizzas with a healthy , fermented dough (I just mix lots of seeds, like freshly grinded flax seeds in). And putting kimchi on top (after baking the pizza) which is very easy to make at home too.
  
And adding some lemons and frozen berries to water that I drink. Plus drinking some apple cider vinegar. 
  
I'm pretty convinced these things helped alot. As the microbiome works with fiber (also called prebiotics) and these foods send sparkles of joy and fun to the brain if they are what your body needs and aches for.

When I quit I was sleeping fine, and waking up without a hangover made it even better. But suddenly this is my third straight night tossing and turning for hours. I am sick and even took NyQuil tonight, but after kind of sleeping for about an hour I am back up.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 So, here we are - we made it to Friday! For anyone facing their first weekend sober, stay strong, you can do it! Reach out any time you need some support, there's always someone around who can help you out.

Also, if anyone with 30 days sober would like to host the Daily Check-In, just reply in the comments and one of the amazing mods will get back to you. It's a good way to give back to the community and sometimes it's just nice to step out of our comfort zones.  Happy Friday everyone, and I will not drink with you today!",46

One night after a hard shift, but before another shift soon (too soon) to come upon me, I was roused out of bed and told to go to my workplace. 

Once I got there, I heard that three of the G.I.s (flight crew and fire fighters) had gotten drunk on beer, hopped in the base’s fire truck and gone to the PX to pick up more beer. On the beer run, the driver somehow flipped the vehicle and one of them was killed (ironically, he was in the _middle_ seat, not one of the window seats.)

The person killed was a genuinely nice guy. His name was very much like a certain famous actor who had played Batman in one of the franchise’ many incarnations. 

I vowed never to drive after even one drink. 

Two decades later I started to bend that rule a little, but caught myself. You see, I was “only” driving on my own property, so it was okay. Right? NOPE! There were sheep and goats and cows and dogs and chickens and turkeys running around wherever they wanted pretty much, and they were used to large vehicles because we would deliver hay bales and feed to them in the backs of the vehicles. Therefore, they would run TO the vehicles rather than get out of the way. 

One of the other drivers ran over one of the dogs (he suffered a broken leg, but we were able to get him up and around eventually), and I ran over one of the birds (they would check the treads after we had driven by to see if our tires had scared up a worm or bug). 

In neither case had the driver been drinking. But I never forgot that G.I. or why he had been killed, so I took my first step in getting off booze. I opened up to my doctor, who prescribed a medication to help curb cravings for alcohol (I don’t think it helped much at all) and I started group therapy for substance abuse (that _did_ help).

A year later, and I have been sober about one quarter to one third of the days, but I’m well on my way to matching my longest streak of (voluntary) sobriety in years.

Recently, I was reading an advice column. The person who had written in was complaining that her husband made promises about important issues that he never kept, and apparently her mother always did the same thing, too. The letter writer was talking about her deep disappointment, and the advice columnist said:

> You’ve got folks selling you shit and telling you it’s ice cream over and over again—and yet you keep going back.

I thought—Oh my God, this is me! I keep taking my empty bowl back to the same people and hoping that what they serve me will this time be ice cream as they’d promised—but it never is. And yet I continue to return with my empty bowl. Why do I keep doing this? Why? Why?",18

I've accepted that I'm not drinking tonight. But tonight and last night around 8 (when I would normally start drinking) I get the cravings. I can deal with that, I can tell myself no.

2019-10-10 22:08:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dg8f3v/habits/,Habits," I’m close to 3 weeks with no booze. It’s been kind of rough. I think part of it is because I get too wrapped up in the future, the daunting “no alcohol... forever” still fucken scares me.. or just makes me sad because it’s something that I have enjoyed for a decade (enjoyed.. but what has also partially destroyed me)... 

I also have a friend coming into town  and staying at my place. While I’m trying to stay optimistic, I can’t help but just kind of know it’s gonna be weird/kinda sucky I’m not drinking with her and everybody. But I want to stay strong. Because a part of my fear is justifying this time drinking.. which justifies next time.. and those times weren’t bad until... bam I do something really shitty. And it brings me back to starting all over again. 


This actually isn’t a fear it’s truth.. because this is my 4th serious attempt to get off the sauce (after a really awful incident).

So I have been enjoying no hangovers and all that. But I’m just generally bummed thinking I should probably never drink again..

I do get excited though. Maintaining the willpower to say no does feel really powerful. And I also find that I do have fun, naturally. No help from booze.. o but still...

Another thing that sucks is what I’ve been referring to as the “habit circle jerk”. I’ve been a real sweets junkie/kinda binge eating. I quit smoking cigs 6 months ago but I bum one here and there and find myself craving those again. And sometimes I notice I’ll smoke just a little bit too much weed. Maybe just a bit too much coffee too. It’s almost unsettling that my mind just needs SOMETHING.. like I need to be entertained ? Idk. 

I have also kind of isolated myself from people. I don’t have many friends or deep connections. I’m a young single mom and I just feel Aimless and unloved sometimes. 

I really want to commit to being sober.

It’s been over a month since my last smoke and edible. I just wanted to come here and let you all know how it’s been going for me.

I quit drinking a week before my last smoke so perhaps this complicates my results... but none the less here we go!

I was a daily drinker and weed smoker for 10-15 years. Now a 37 year old male. I quit everything after my wonderful girlfriend left me. It came as a shock but I soon realised how much my drinking and smoking had eroded my self worth and my how much I had been just running on auto pilot for years. I didn’t want to go out and socialise, I struggled to learn new things and my memory was pretty shot! Hitting rock bottom inspired me to finally clean up my life. I had felt like this before. Like I wanted to stop. But every time I just drowned out these feelings with substances and continued on in autopilot. I had good jobs, friends and told myself that I was just high functioning and that I could or world not ever be able to live without drinking and weed.

To quit I told my close friends and family what had happened and how I intended to finally clean up my life. That night I went to my first AA (wasn’t a fan) and went to SMART recovery group later that week (which I love and still attend) I spoke to my GP and she prescribed some Benzos for the withdrawal for the first 2 weeks but warned me to be careful!

The first couple of weeks were pretty tough! I had the shakes the first week, very anxious, lost my appetite, my dreams came back and were very vivid (they still are) but I had frequent nightmares.... but they didn’t last. After about 2-3 weeks without drinking 1-2 without smoking the bad stuff has stopped mostly.

What really helped me was attending 2 smart recovery meetings a week. Daily exercise (I started with afternoon walks for an hour or two, after 10 days I bought a fancy push bike and went on daily rides instead and found a gym I liked and started to work out) this got me really tired at night and I have been sleeping the best I’ve been in years!!! Not to mention the visual physical benefits!! I speak to a councillor/psychologist once a week if I can get a booking. This helps to unpack all the reasons I had to be using. Find out what are the emotional issues I had been hiding from and work out sober ways to deal with them face on! (Also taking daily vitamin B, multivitamin and berocca)

I also started  to meditate. This helped me sleeping when I was struggling to drift off, or escape cyclical negative thoughts when I was overthinking things. I haven’t been doing it as much recently as I started a new job and have no problems getting to sleep but I do return to it every few days to clear my mind for a bit.

So the positive changes have been quite noticeable for me... far outweighing the negative ones. I have far more confidence and my anxiety has pretty much disappeared. I’m looking younger and more fit, I don’t eat the same junk food I was when I had the munchies. I am very present in conversations now, not drifting off or being stuck in my head like I used to be. My motivation is improving day by day. I sleep much better and keep regular sleeping patterns. I got a new job and am throwing myself into it and making progress. My memory is much much better! I thought I had smoked myself stupid... but it’s all coming back to me. I’m proud of myself again for the first time in years. 

All in all I’m so glad I made this change. I don’t really miss the drinking or smoking apart from when I see other people doing it or smell it. (Or the rare occasion that I feel horrible emotionally and want to give up) But then I just remind myself of how much things have improved for me and if I used to hide from emotions they would just be there in the morning but now added to them would be the guilt of letting myself down. This is motivation enough for me to resist the temptations.

I don’t think I could have done this just by quitting and not changing anything else. If I was still sitting on the couch or laying in bed feeling sorry for myself I would have lapsed I’m sure. It was the exercise, talking, meetings, and coming on to forums like this that filled my time with positive things to replace the bad habits. Creating new neural pathways for a healthier, happier life.

I am proof that it can be done, that the voice that tells you that you can’t do it is lying to you. 

You CAN do it!!!",74

Once i start i can't stop, and I've been drinking almost daily for over 10 years, sometimes socially but mostly alone.

I get nowhere and still hurt my health and my weight-training goals, I scare my family and my self. I'm sitting here on my day off and feeling lonely/sad/angry/frustrated and directionless, it sucks to feel this way, but I am also kinda happy in a way, because it means i'm not drunk. Not sure if anyone else can relate. Real pain is better than a destructive lie for me.",7

I am in my late 20s. I have a wife, kids, and a stable job where I am successful and relied upon. If you looked at my life from afar, it would look idealistic. It isn't. I have, to various degrees, been drinking since I was about 17. At first, it was for fun, and it tasted good. Somewhere along the way, my mental health started to deteriorate. It began with periodic panic attacks, and has turned into being afraid to leave the house, take medication, you name it.  Nausea, sweating, fatigue, chronic pain, insomnia, you name it, I've got it, and the only way I've ever known to calm my misery is via drinking. At this point, I'm certain the alcohol is begetting the anxiety in its own way. I have medication prescribed for my anxiety that I refuse to take because I don't want to stop drinking to do so. 

I used to be in good physical shape - nothing crazy, but fit. I am now 50-60lbs overweight. Last week, I had to participate in some mild physical activity (which I normally avoid at all costs). During and after, I was legitimately concerned about dying. My heart and lungs could not handle it. I was embarrassed, and I knew why - my booze got me here. 

For whatever reason, I decided that was the last straw. I was going to get healthy. A few hours later, I got home, and immediately went back to drinking thanks to my shame and physical pain. I don't get blackout drunk, I don't drink enough to puke, I don't get drunk in public, and I don't typically drink in the morning or afternoon. But like clockwork, after a long day at work, and after my wife has gone to bed so she won't see me, I'll have 3-5 drinks so I can go to sleep and stop being miserable. I want to stop. It's ruining my life, and it's going to get worse (that's all it ever does). But I don't know how, and even more than that, I'm terrified of stopping. I don't want to feel exposed and raw to my problems; I feel like I need that layer of numbness that the buzz brings. 

This has been going on consistently for 2 +/- years, sporadically before that. I need your tips, your tricks, and maybe most of all your encouragement. It would be much appreciated.",4
2019-10-10 17:04:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dg4j47/2_months_the_longest_ive_ever_gone_since_i/,2 months - the longest I’ve ever gone since I started drinking 8 years ago,"I’m rounding on 60 days and everyone’s posts on here have helped me so much, I wanted to share my experience as well. 

I suppose you could say that I had a rough start to life. I experienced multiple traumatic events that stacked on top of each other to weigh me down and I had no outside emotional support whatsoever. The older I got, the more lost and alone and, above all, miserable I got. Then I discovered alcohol when I was 16. And I started drinking to help numb the things that I wasn’t ready to or capable of dealing with. That girl liked her vodka.

She carried a handle around with her 24/7 and referred to it as her best friend - jokingly, of course. She took shots to “prepare” for social situations. At first she just drank with her friends and at parties on the weekends. But then, she realized that she liked how alcohol made her feel - or not feel - and started drinking every day she could. She’d drink alone all the time and that would frequently end in getting so drunk that she couldn’t move and then she’d pass out, too drunk to even remember what was upsetting her. 

Once she graduated high school and was on her own with nobody to witness her bad habits, she drank more. She made friends exclusively for drinking and partying with. Her first friend tried to force himself on her while she was spinning on his bed, queasy from too many shots. She ran out of the apartment shoeless. She was too drunk to find her car in the lot so she passed out in a bush for a 30 minute “sobering up” power nap. Then she drove home. 

She got in to a habit of doing what she did that night - drinking so much that she blacked out and inevitably passed out on the first bed she saw. Eventually this led to her passing out on the wrong guy’s bed and he raped her. 

This shook some sense in to her, right? No. She was confused and shook to the core, but she couldn’t give up alcohol. She needed it. Instead she just stopped going to parties. Problem solved. 

Blacking out became a regular thing. It stopped mattering how much she drank. One beer? Blackout. 11 shots? Blackout. She drove drunk. She went to work drunk. She missed work, doctor’s appointments, and classes because she was too hungover to move. She always made sure that she had drinks on hand for any event necessary. She especially made sure that she had drinks on hand for when she had sex.

She nearly drowned in a river because she was too drunk to catch her footing. She tried to drunkenly walk home from a bar and got lost and got in the car with a complete stranger who proceeded to kiss her. She drove drunk countless times. She had sex with multiple people when she was blacked out or just too drunk to function. She had sex with a married man. She had sex with various guys that were already in relationships. She drunkenly cheated on boyfriends. She got an MIC (Minor in Consumption) and an MIP (Minor in Possession) and nearly got arrested on multiple occasions. She knew she was reckless with her life, but she didn’t care. She knew she was damaging her body and her brain, but she didn’t care. 

She finally got to a place where she was ready to heal what was really causing her alcoholism. She started working to heal and better herself. But she was still terrified of facing life without the crutch that was alcohol. So she decided to just cut back. She was generally successful, but there was always the same pattern; casually drinking to the big buildup: the binge. The binge would last X amount of time and would always end in a blackout. Or a blackout and puking. Or a blackout and sex with a random person. Then she would pull herself together and cut back for X amount of time. Until that eventually led to the binge. And the cycle continued. Until the realization finally hit her: she didn’t know who she was without alcohol. And she was scared of that. She was scared that she didn’t know how to socialize without alcohol. She was scared that she didn’t know how to have sex without alcohol. Above all, she was scared of what life was without something to numb her. 

But she wanted to find out anyway. The shame and disappointment and constant hangovers began to outweigh the fear. She was afraid of how her new friends would react. She knew people would question her and judge her decision to stop drinking completely. And she was right. And she was influenced at first. Why couldn’t she just have one beer when out? Why couldn’t she just have a glass of wine with dinner? She loves the taste of wine - she doesn’t even drink it with the intent of getting drunk! Some of her friends thought that she was going a bit overboard - not drinking AT ALL? That’s crazy.

But they weren’t there for her lowest points. They don’t see the full spectrum of what led her to alcohol and what kept her drunk. Then she found you wonderful people on r/stopdrinking. And she knew that she wasn’t over reacting. And she knew that the only way that she could truly move forward in to happiness and health was to stop completely. And she did that two months ago. And she hasn’t looked back since. 

I bet you would be surprised to hear that that girl is an engineer. And she has a great job and great friends and she’s genuinely happy. She still has rough days. But she faces them sober now. And, damn, that really makes her realize that she was never facing them when she was drunk all the time. Alcohol truly is a crutch. But, when the time is right, you put that crutch down and learn to walk again. 

I’m writing this for all of you out there who drank or still drink to avoid something. For those of you who’ve had traumatic experiences and are using alcohol to cope, I understand. But I am here to tell you that it does get better. Someone quoted this to me from a book (I believe) “When I was addicted to heroin, I went to a rehab facility and the sober leader said ‘Good for you for finding heroin - you found something that helped you survive when nothing else could. But it’s time to move forward now.’” I used alcohol to help me survive a time when all I honestly wanted was to die. But it’s time to move forward now. 

Good luck everyone. I’m aiming for many many more days. IWNDWYT",16

The truth here is that many of us who abuse alcohol have crossed that line from liking it to wanting it is called addiction. All addictions effect the same four areas of the brain. There are chemicals produced by the brain. Two that stand out are dopamine and serotonin. There are synapses that transmit chemical neurons to the receptors in effector cells that respond to stimuli. When addiction occurs your brain gets hijacked and the normal functions are greatly impaired. These receptors that receive these new signals from the brain, the connections gets stronger. The dopamine levels magnify to a point that they now start to prune back before they die. Hence an increase is needed to get the same lasting effect and when that has been exhausted you need it just to feel and function normally. Brain scans confirm this by the increased and decreased levels of activity of normal and addictive brains. Scans also show an almost normal return to brain functions in about 14 months abstinence. In my opinion addiction is a learnt behavior that takes a long time to realize that there is a problem. Need not go into detail here. **Addiction Destroys Period !** Recovery is possible but for most the recovery we are looking for does not exist. To recovery to some past point in time when you could just have one. Until you realize and accept this recovery is not possible. Change is needed. What helped me change were, How I responded to the exposure of the stimuli to the environment I am in. My behavior to the stimuli and my response to that stimuli. You can use it as an excuse to use or sum it up as an experience that you experienced and do not have to act on it. Living an addictive free live is **FREE.** Dr. Robert Lustig sums it up quite well with his analogy on addiction. The 4C""s. Can be found at Robert Lustigs web site. 

   
 

**I am not a Doctor** and this is my own personal research that has given me a chance and choice to be sober today. At the height of my addiction, I drank between 75 to 125 ounces of brandy in 72 hours then stopped just to do it again the next weekend.",2

I’ve been attending several AA meetings a week as part of my recovery plan and struggled with identifying myself as an alcoholic. I knew it wasn’t a requirement and I’m only identifying myself as such in the meetings. My initial reservations were the stigma behind the word and worry it would negatively impact my recovery (low self worth etc). 

That changed for me this weekend. I didn’t crave alcohol but did have alcohol in my dreams / nightmares. I’m okay with planning for known events where alcohol will be served but have been worrying about a future where alcohol might slide in and ruin the progress I’ve made. So for me, saying I’m an alcoholic in these support meetings is to scare the sh&t out of me. To remind me of where I’ve been and keep me honest and I’m check. I’ll deal with any psychological ramifications of this label (if any) later. For now, it’s another accountability tool I need in my arsenal. 

Curious if others struggled here and what the term means for them.

We had our customer conference this week out of town.   Usually this is a lot of drinking - with the team; with the clients etc.   And I was speaking, so extra pressure.  

I was worried going in - would I miss out on the fun.  Would I not be as entertaining.  Would I not build stronger relationships with our customers.  Etc etc 

In short, it went great.  I was more present and engaged with customers (less agitation in my head); I laughed deeply with my team and genuinely enjoyed the moment. 

In retrospect, I was less stressed that I’d say something stupid or do something or forget something.  It’s more real.  And yes there’s stress and yes still noise - but all in all - 4 months is I’m happier than I’ve ever been.  

For those thinking about it - just give it a try.   If it doesn’t happen, don’t beat yourself up.  Focus on doing better next time.  Not about being perfect.

This morning I wake up at like 4am with a killer hangover and find out that the Nats won! And I cannot believe I missed the freaking playoff game at Dodger Stadium because I was drunk.

My school is big on drinking. I drank a lot before, but I turned 21 this summer and I think there have been maybe 3 days since then that I haven’t had a drink. I have to be slightly buzzed before doing anything now. My tolerance has gone up and while I used to just throw up after drinking too much, now I can drink until I black out, which seems to happen every weekend.

Hello everyone, first time Reddit user, I read an article and this group was mentioned as a great place for support for people in a similar position to me.
I see that we should “only post when sober”, I’m assuming that means ‘not drunk’ rather than “have quit” as I haven’t quite reached that stage yet. If I’ve got that wrong please delete my post.

Apologies if I ramble on a bit, I guess it’s just good to write it all down.

So, a bit about me and where I am, I’m a 38 year old father of two, in the last 2.5 years my partner of 5 years has moved in with me, we’ve got married, I’ve changed my job of 10 years and then had 2 children, yes, my boys have just turned 1 and 2.... this period has been a bit stressful and I’ve seen all space I had go in an instant. My job is a pretty good job to have, in the fact that it’s well paid and I am based from home, I don’t have to go out to customers too often so it does give me more time with my family.
To regain my ‘me time’ I’ve started to stay up later and later, I now go to bed between 3am & 5am every night, I’ll normally consume close to 
my recommended weekly intake of alcohol each night and will be up, wide awake at 8am to wake my eldest for breakfast and then be ready to start work at 9am. I never get ‘drunk’ in the true sense of the word, my body seems used to it. My routine has been at this level for a year and was building up to it for a year before that, no one is aware of the amount I drink really as I only really drink of a night, on my own, I don’t drink during the day and I rarely ever go out drinking, it’s just for unwinding at home when the house is quite and all are in bed.

It is possible to quit... I went out on a work get together in the beginning of July this year and had quite a bit more than even I’m used to and I actually quit the next day, I was clear of alcohol until the last day of July, my birthday, I didn’t go out drinking but my wife had already bought me a very nice bottle of rum, I decided to treat myself and I drank it over the next 2 days and then I did manage to go back to no alcohol for another 2 weeks and then I went out of my way to help someone at work and as a thank you they posted a bottle of my favourite rum to my home address.... I did go back to having no alcohol after but gradually I’m back to where I was.
It annoys me! I’m not a stupid guy, I just don’t understand how even though I know it’s bad for me yet I still go and buy more....sigh...
I managed to quit smoking in the past, I smoked up until a couple of weeks after my dad passed away at 53 (he died coronary heart disease) and that was 15 years ago, I’ve never touched one since, I guess I had a big push then.

My work provide a complImentary health assessment where they test and screen you for everything....I keep getting reminders and putting it off as I’m scared what they may find, if they find nothing then I worry it will almost validate my drinking is ok, which it’s not, and if they do find something bad then as well as the health implications it could jeopardise other things as well, we’re selling our house at the moment (more stress) and it’ll mean I may not be eligible for the new mortgage....stupid things to be thinking of but it’s all stupid to be in this position.

I’m out on another work get together tonight, my first night out since the one at the beginning of July, I guess I’m hoping the same happens again and I’m put off the following day... 

I think how if I continue I won’t get to see my sons grow up...I’m almost accepting that as a fact and it’s just too late....but maybe I’m overreacting...

Anyway, that’s all from me for now.

Regards,

Jay.",5

I wasn’t a huge garbage monster who feasted on the bones of children and chortled at the thought of war, sure. But I wasn’t great. 

I used to crave attention drunk but felt paralyzed when I received it sober. Getting attention when I’m sober felt/still feels like a spotlight on my inadequacies. I used alcohol to quiet my brain. Drunk me LOVED attention. Drunk me loved a lot of things, actually. Mostly ruining the life that sober me had built. 

Drunk me was loud and sometimes funny but often inappropriate and habitually selfish. Drunk me said nonsensical, sometimes hurtful things to the people I cared about. Or to strangers. Drunk me was not particular. 

Drunk me did a lot of shameful things that sober me is now left to grapple with. I go through the steps. I make amends with those I’ve wronged. I make living amends by trying to improve. But I can’t let go. I can’t forgive myself. 

So I’m in limbo, I guess. And the limbo-ness is turning me into a self-absorbed person because I spend so much energy ruminating on my mistakes and how I can make things right. But no matter what I do, it’s never enough for myself. How much penance until I let myself move on?",28

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I highly recommend this resource, the book is full of brilliant exercises but I just felt this one might help someone on /r/stopdrinking today:

""**Stop**: When you find yourself in a tempting situation, the first thing you need to do to connect with the present moment is to stop and step out of automatic pilot mode. When you stop, you interrupt that automatic sequence of behaviors that can follow a craving or a strong emotion, and it’s that very sequence that you are working on changing when you are in addiction recovery.

**Observe:** Once you’ve stopped and stepped out of automatic pilot, the next step is to observe your experience. Observe what is happening, right in the moment. Ask yourself what you are feeling right now. Using the example of a craving, observe where you feel it in your body, any thoughts you have about drinking or using, and any emotions you might be experiencing. Notice yourself allowing the presence of these uncomfortable aspects of your experience—letting them be just as they are, rather than pushing them away.

**Breathe:** You’ve taken yourself out of automatic pilot and observed your present experience. The next step is to connect with your breath. Take a moment to do this, guiding your attention to the movement of your breath.

**Expand your awareness:** Broadening your focus from the movement of your breath, you can now expand your awareness to include your entire body as a whole, connecting with all of the sensations you are experiencing in the present moment.

**Respond mindfully**: We’ve been talking about responding with mindful awareness, rather than reacting in automatic pilot. This is the final step in the SOBER breathing exercise. Now that you have connected with your experience and your breath, you can consider the range of choices that you have in this situation. Recognize that you can accept the discomfort that you’re feeling. And while you are allowing it to be there, just as it is, you can still respond by choosing, with mindful awareness, what action to take. You are in a better place to consider the consequences of the different choices you can make, and choose to respond to the discomfort you are experiencing in a way that is nurturing, self-protective, and consistent with your recovery goals.""

I came out of an extremely abusive and dangerous relationship about that time, and ended up drinking anywhere between 5-10 drinks a day consistently to try to numb my trauma. I was also getting actively stalked and I didn't know how to deal with my terror. I got diagnosed with severe PTSD in April, and have been in therapy since then. I went on antidepressants, which conflict a lot with alcohol and have attributed to many issues with my memory.

For the past few months now, I've noticed a pattern emerging as I've been healing. I no longer drink to numb my trauma (besides maybe once a month-- and even then I've been keeping it to 1-2 drinks). I now mostly drink because life feels so incredibly boring. This realization has confused and surprised me. I almost got used to being on an adrenaline high from being in danger and almost got addicted to the feeling. I actually get anxious/ancy when I'm not drunk, and have trouble sitting still. I'm oddly more relaxed and calm when I'm drunk.

Can anyone else relate? Do you have any tips for how to deal with the boredom?",2

My divorce derailed because my soon to be exwife basically went from working with my lawyer to working me on the final items not covered by the divorce decree and went emotionally nuts is the best way I can describe it. I thought all night about sending a nasty gram and taking a drink. I realized thats what old me would have done. I wasnt comfortable in my own skin and I wasted so much energy on something I had no control over. I decided to write it out instead of type it thinking that would give me some time to hash my thoughts out and make sure its what I wanted to do and sleep on it. I got about 3 hours, woke up and the squirrel  cage started to spin up again. Its want I wanted to do I was sure of it. But when I go the keyboard I'm not sure what happened but my tone changed from angry to ""done"" if thats a feeling. 30 minutes later I get a IM from my wife saying she didnt want to fight anymore and just talk. It was like old us, we cooperated, got our last issues resolved. Neither of us was happy about the result so I know we both got as close to what we wanted without giving up to much and low and behold everything is back on track and we have open lines of communication without pretext that we didnt have 3 months ago. I even got a few more items out of the deal and concessions.

&#x200B;

Drinking is a beast upon itself. Old me never ever would have been able to pull that off. Fear would have taken over and the whole thing would have imploded. Feeling my feelings saved the day, something that when I was married, alcohol took from me. I am emotional drained now and tired but I didnt drink and I think I handled it well. Big improvement.

I owe my success to:

* This Reddit Group
* AA
* My Sponsor
* My therapist
* My Family and Friends
* My leave of absence from work
* My Doctor 

Since I've become sober I've:

* Gone to the gym almost every day
* Cleaned up a massive amount of dust and garbage/crap from my apartment
* Bought new furniture
* Focused on self-care habits (skin care routine etc.)
* Started going to movies again
* Been more present in people's lives (listening, remembering, being supportive etc.)
* Beginning to get in touch with my own spirituality again
* Cooking

My addictive behaviours and mental health struggles surrounding them caused me to give up on so much in life.

Not *at all*. 


Wouldn’t I be happy if I was right? Of course. Except that means that other people have to know (and more importantly agree) with my rightness. That’s the flaw in my internal, addict logic. Despite my best efforts other people remain, strangely, disobedient.

the problem is that now i'm so fucking annoyed by alcohol culture. i think it's one of those things that you don't notice how prevalent it is until you're trying to avoid it. i feel like i'm constantly being slapped in the face by alcohol. i'm mad about how little we're taught about its effects, and how pervasive it is in our culture. i'm mad that people don't know what it's doing to them. i'm mad that it took time and energy away from me, and that i made dumb decisions that i feel shameful about because of it. i'm mad that it took me this long to question my use of it, but i'm also mad that i wasn't taught to question it. i'm young, and i don't know anyone else who has stopped drinking. i have a few friends who don't drink, but they never did, so i don't feel like they're going to understand the grief that i feel about this. i kind of ranted about it in my therapy group last week after someone made a comment about drinking a lot on vacation being a ""success!"" but again, i'm the only one in there that doesn't drink and so i was met with a lot of defensiveness, and i just want someone who gets it to be fucking pissed and angry and upset about this with me.

Someone I work with (I'm a carer) died, my son (10, autistic) had a shit-awful day at school, (his behaviour and refusal to do work) and I've been thinking about drinking. And honestly? I came closer than I have so far to just fucking off to the shop, and buying 8 half litre cans of beer and getting pretty fucked. I thought about how much is enjoy it, how relaxed I'd feel. And how is look at myself in the mirror tomorrow morning. How I'd feel when I didn't go for a run because I was hung over. How the withdrawal would fuck me over more than any training session I've had, and whilst at work, (12 hours, yay!) I decided to take my desire for alcohol in hand (figuratively speaking, this was in my head) and say ""Listen here, cunt-face. You're not winning. Not today, not tomorrow, and it'll take a lot more than a bad day to make me give in. So pack your bags, fuck off and spare ye not the horses amigo!"" 

Thing is, apart from mornings when I get enough sleep, I'm feeling pretty damn good. (If I get enough sleep it's a long journey to wakefulness.) My memory has improved by a long shot, I have more energy, I'm more mentally and emotionally stable, more focused and I can relax better. 

And I don't wake up and the first thing I think of is having a drink that night. That's the clincher. _I don't have to think that anymore._

So I'm gonna enjoy this bath I've just run, listen to some music, eat something and then go to bed. I may put my wife to bed first and play PS4, but in the morning, it's school run, go for a run and then back to bed, hopefully. 😉

And plenty of Pepsi Max. The drink of the gods.

I am really having a hard time this past week. There have been some ups and downs. I'm not used to experiencing emotions with such intensity and it's overwhelming. Day 1 was miserable, all I could do to stay sober was lie down in the dark and stare at the wall until I eventually fell asleep. I had a couple of really good days over the weekend, but wild mood swings are making me feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I've kinda been pouring myself into gaming when I'm not working because it's the only thing I've found besides sleeping that keeps me from thinking about beer. Almost the second I pause the game, thoughts of drinking creep back in. I feel frustrated reading all of the success stories. People are reporting all the wonderful changes in their life and I feel happy for them, but also resentful because I feel none of that. I am losing sight of what I wanted to accomplish by quitting. I've known I was a problem drinker for years, with a poor memory and hangovers every 1-2 weeks. drinking alone, in the mornings, etc. I checked pretty much all the boxes. But if this is what sober me is like, maybe I don't want to be sober. 

I don't want to pat myself on the back for being a moody, brooding basket case. I'm 35 and too old for this shit. I know I should try to pour myself into hobbies, start exercising, but I just don't care about any of those things right now. Maybe I just need more sober time to adjust to living my life fully conscious and present. Maybe I will learn real coping skills and come around to shouting ""Hip hip hooray, sober 4 lyfe!"" Right now, I just feel empty. Instead of hating myself for drinking, I just hate myself. I don't want to be the guy who pats himself on the back for running a 5 miles a day or switching to herbal tea. I'm refusing to see or talk to my friends and family because I don't want to have to pretend everything is OK.

I have my second therapist appointment tomorrow afternoon. I'm not planning to cave before then. I doubt she will be able to help me. When I told her last week I was quitting, she said things like ""2 beers can't get you drunk"" and ""I like to enjoy a glass of wine in the evenings to relax."" Kindof seems oblivious since I told her my primary concern was substance use, what's she trying to accomplish? Sounds like she wants to enable me so she doesn't have to question her own habit. 

I'm not really looking for advice. Just hoping I'm not the only one who feels this way and maybe some reassurance that this ridiculous nonsense is a normal part of the recovery process.",6

The hardest part for me is the anxiety when the alcohol wears off. It's worse every time, and now feels like I'm stuck in a full on panic attack for a day or two.

My partner will have been booze-free for 1 year on the 20th and I admire the hell out of him for it. He's healthy, glowing, motivated, creative and lost 20 lbs. and looks amazing. Beyond that though, he's HAPPY. He used to be anxious/depressed/angry off and on in different bouts and no doubt the amount of drinking he did wasn't helpful.

Anyway. 18 days ago, I hung out with one of my best friends and bar hopped. We must have gone to 5 different places. One shot of Jame-o at the last place was the straw that broke it... I went home and puked my guts out, lost my wallet (a kind stranger returned it thank god!) and spent the next morning puking bile for half the day. While sitting on the floor of the shower feeling like the biggest loser in the world, I decided that goddamn do I envy what my partner has done for himself. These kind of benders screw my sleep and stomach up for the WHOLE week on top of it. It's wild. And so, here I am 17 days booze free, which even included a wedding last weekend where a dozen of my friends were at... Nope! No drinking for me.

I constantly get headaches/migraines and wonder if stopping booze altogether would get rid of them. When I did drink, it was only once a week or even once every 2 weeks but I just feel it's not worth it. There's no benefit from it. 

Anyway, this sub rules. And you all rule. And I want to see just how great being long-term sober can be. My partner (who was once a big partier) said it's the greatest thing he's ever done for himself and everything in life is SO much better now. How awesome.

I've been on the verge of this for a long time but consider this my notice to the universe. I'm done drinking starting today. 

It's consumed my life. I drink to celebrate. I drink when I'm board. I drink with friends. I drink when I'm alone. It's unusual to find me after work not thinking about grabbing a beer and every morning I wake up and it's like I'm a different person asking why? Why did you drink last night? 

It doesn't negativity effect my day to day life and that's always been my excuse. You're not an alcoholic. You've got your shit together. You just like beer and bourbon. I know my wife wishes I didn't drink as much but she's given up on saying anything to me about it. It's hard for her to argue the point cause I don't do stupid stuff when I drink and I don't drink so much that I wake up with a hangover every morning. So she's let it go for the most part but I know it bothers her. I really enjoy when we drink together but typically it's just me drinking as she gives me dirty looks as I head back to the fridge.

IWNDWYT. I've been rolling that through my head the past couple days. This sub came up after hitting the random sub button and it hit me pretty hard that the universe was trying to tell me something. IWNDWYT. That's me. Talking to me. That has got to be my internal conversation.

We spent much of our courtship in bars/events like this, going out on the town, and drinking away some very hard times we both were going through.  We weren’t “drunks” because we were wearing suits, throwing money around, and in high-class places... even if we were blacked out. Ugg. 

After seven years, I quit my job, moved to the city he lives, and we were married (hitched for almost 2 years now). He’s in sales for a premium luxury ($1M above) product, so we are constantly out socializing with the people that can buy such things... we don’t have kids (no plans to) and enjoy a footloose lifestyle. And why do I say this? It’s part of the problem.

I’m now focused on getting sober and have already proven I can make it through trips, a wedding, networking events, social gatherings, etc. and no one hardly noticing. He’s now panicking and asking, “so how long are you doing this no drinking thing?” 

He knows I want to quit forever... and how much I have struggled with it throughout the past 20+ years. 

I think he’s scared of losing his “partner in crime” and what this means for US TOGETHER. During our dating phase, being out and drinking was always a big part of our lifestyle and couple bonding, and to some extent, is still a part of his livelihood. (I keep thinking the advice I was given, “marry the person you’re with, not who you think they’ll become.” Was I false advertising who I was?! Did I think he would change?) 

He HATES therapy, he’s a stiff-upper-lip kind of guy, but he has agreed to go. The therapist I booked just pushed out the appointment a couple weeks but I want to wait for this person. I’m just really struggling with my husband not authentically supporting me right now. 

“If you don’t want to do this [event] and go out with me, why did we even get married?!” Ouch. That one hurt. It took a lot to not react with a jab back. 

Have any of you guys experienced a significant other not being authentically happy and supportive of you getting sober or claimed they were “losing their partner in crime” or you’re not the person they married? 

How did your relationship change with your SO through this process? 

Thank you.

* If I buy ___ size, how many drinks does that make? 
* What if I need more, what stores can I rotate? 
* Should I avoid using my discount card so my purchases aren't tracked? 
* What is the earliest I can start without getting TOO drunk? 
* How can I organize my day so I have as little to do as possible (since you know, I won't be focused enough to get anything done) 
* What's the easiest dinner I can cook?

I just want to start by saying how thankful I am for this sub.  I stop by almost every day and have always found it to be a wonderfully supportive and friendly place.

I have a question for those who have been able to string together around 90 days or more....but first a little background!

I quit in Dec 2018 and haven’t looked back.  I read This Naked Mind, used this sub, see a therapist, meditate, work out, and eat copious amounts of ice cream to support my own sobriety.  Once I made the decision to quit, I quit.  I understand I am unusual. Most people don’t find “spontaneous sobriety” like I did.  Most people go though fits and starts.  They do a little field research.  They try some tools, relapse, and then try some more others.  I understand that this is the more common way of things.

My spouse started to try to quit around the same time I did.  We actually started on the same day, and we committed to a 30 day sobriety trial together.  He relapsed on Christmas.  

Since then, he has had a very difficult time stopping and staying stopped.  He has tried: Intensive Outpatient therapy, Naltrexone and anti-anxiety meds, reading This Naked Mind, AA meetings (including getting a sponsor and working the steps), behavioral therapy, and other resources.  The longest he as made it is 34 days.

My (multi-fold) question for you good people who have strung together 90 days is:
1.  How many relapses did you have before you found sustained sobriety?
2.  What tool or insight do you believe was the most critical in your sobriety success?
3.  Any other advice or wisdom for me or my spouse?

Alcohol is shit and although I’ve been trying to remain positive and hopeful, I’m feeling really defeated.  I really look forward to your hopeful and encouraging words.  Also, I am attending Al-anon meetings so I’ve got them in my corner too! 🙌🏻

I thoroughly impress myself everyday with who I have become and the people I attach myself to, both good and bad.  I should be proud of my accomplishments and positions in life... Instead I am anxious, everyday. I am depressed, everyday. And oddly enough, I am happy, everyday.

My problem is that the negatives constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY, overcome the positives by the time my head hits the pillow every night. 

Every day I numb myself with alcohol, and every day I am in denial about it. I can go a majority of the day with out drinking (on my better days), but once that time comes, I deeply enjoy it. 

I deeply immerse myself in the distraction from my human emotions as a solution to my problems. The funniest/worst part is that I am 100% aware of these actions and provide myself with nothing but regret. That awareness only breaks me down further each and every day.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with me. Now I’ll wait a few moments for the emotion to hit. EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH ME. The reason everything is wrong with me is because I know everything about me needs some form of solution. 

There are an immeasurable amount of variables to a human that can be “fixed” or “tweaked” to allow them to perform, and most importantly,  LIVE better. For me, I am hesitant and afraid to admit that I believe (and know) quitting alcohol will better my life.

I don’t want to stop. I really don’t. I love it. I am confident I have control. But the truth is, I’m wrong.

It wasn't until the next day (today) that we realized our problem isn't just related to the legality. We both will drink until our bodies hate us. She's been my rock in trying to get sober. So, when we could drink legally it felt like a free pass. I've never had legal troubles, but I just learned we are both the type of person that 1 is too many and 10 is not enough. I feel like I should've known better for the both of us, but I'm not blaming myself cause then I would just say ""drink!"" There is shame and embarrassment today that has not been a thing for years.

I have been drinking almost every day since 2013 or 2014, outside of a few weeks each year that I've been on vacation with my family or with friends.  My dad got sick in October 2011, but I managed to keep it in check for awhile until my ex went away to college to get her masters.  It kind of fell apart after that.

Long story short, I went in to UrgiCare last week because of an infected bug bite.  I have diabetes so these things can progress fast.  They treated the bite and prescribed me antibiotics, but when I told them that I had diabetes that wasn't in control, they took my blood sugar level and were alarmed at how high it was.  They did blood tests and found that I wasn't in danger of going in to a coma and dying, but that I had to see a doctor soon.

Of course, because I suck, I haven't seen one or scheduled a visit yet.  I had planned to not drink during the work week as a first step, yet I lasted all of one day.  I don't know what to do with myself.  The only thing I look forward to is drinking after work.  When I don't, I just end up sleeping all night.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

For most of us, we are halfway through the workweek - yay!  I saw this quote today:  ""It doesn't matter how slow you go as long as you don't stop.""  Confucius.  I ""run"" half marathons - really slowly.  When I first started, I compared myself to the other runners and would feel really defeated because I had trained as much as they had and they were way faster.  After 5 years and I'm just getting slower, I really don't care - I stop and pet dogs on the course, I take candy from little kids with grimy hands, I look at the scenery or buildings as I plod along and I talk to people who are struggling or hurting.  The same is true of my sobriety - my sobriety may not be as shiny as someone else's; I've gained 5 pounds and I'm still trying to get out of debt, but I'm okay with my life as it is right now.  I now have a lot of quiet and a lot of peace.  Maybe boring for someone else, but it suits me just fine. So, let's all keep going and not stop; we've got this.  I hope you all have a wonderful Wednesday!",83

A number of you and my friends implored me to go to the doctor regardless of if the pain went away.

Thank God I listened. I went to the doctor a few days ago. My liver enzymes are slightly elevated. Today I had an ultrasound, and I have a fatty and enlarged liver. I should be grateful to catch the damage in the earlier stages, but I'm just so mad at myself. I dont know what I expected drinking that much for so long. I always felt like my body was invincible and that I would quit before it caught up to me. Now I have done damage to myself that will never completely go back to normal.

I can't ever drink again without putting myself at risk of furthering the damage I've done. I haven't had anything to drink since last Saturday (9 days ago). It's been strange getting used to this new lifestyle. I was so attached to drinking at the end of the day. But I don't want to die. Forever seems daunting, but I have to stop. This change is just overwhelming right now.

I'm glad I know where I am now. And I just wanted to thank you guys for encouraging me to face the music. I may have been much worse off in the future had I continued to ignore the problem.

Hopefully I can heal and live a healthier, more fulfilling life. 

Best wishes to all of you.

Taking time to think about how I am feeling and what my body and mind really want/need in a moment. But the evenings have been tough and, surprisingly, not because of urges. I feel like crap when I come back from my walk. I stretch, I take a warm bath, I eat. I am getting daily headaches and it is sucking. I woke up with a headache right behind my eyeball and it took a couple hours to pass. I have a mild one now and am hoping they will get better as the days pass. 

I will also be vigilant for the first nights that I end up feeling better. I don’t feel like drinking now because I am kind of nauseated from the headaches, but that will pass and some evening soon I will feel physically well and will have to deal with the cravings.

2019-10-08 20:19:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/df90pw/1_month_sober/,1 Month Sober,"As of yesterday, I’ve maintain one month of sobriety. Emotionally, it’s been a bit of a roller coaster, but I think generally I’ve been feeling good. Mostly, I feel more focused and aware. A little tired sometimes, but I think this is because of a change in my sleeping patterns.

What motivated me to stop drinking was getting arrested in July this year for drunk driving. Leaving a friends house after drinking I got pulled over for speeding, and blew a 0.22. I spent the night in jail and was picked up the next morning by the same friend and his wife (who had not been drinking the previous night).

Looking back, of course I realize that deciding To drive home was a horrible decision. I think at the time I was rationalizing that I only lived about 10 minute drive away, but honestly there was no reason for me to get into my car. What’s scary was that my memory is very spotty of that drive home and I can barely remember getting pulled over and the process of being arrested. 0.22 is extremely high and I’m lucky that the night did not end in any sort of accident.

I think that night was an important wake up call that I desperately needed in regards to my drinking habits. I live in Wisconsin where the drinking culture, and the prevalence of drunk driving, is pretty crazy. I was really getting into a bad habit of drinking and driving, which was also tied to my pretty steady drinking habits. Nothing got too out of hand,  but I was drinking pretty much every night (largely to cope with some sleep and depression/anxiety issues) and I feel like there was potential for things to slip.

After getting pulled over I stopped drinking for 2 weeks. It took a while for my court appearance to happen (it was initially set back and didn’t actually happen until September 3rd) so I started to drink again, picking it up at a grad party. After my court appearance, I was convicted of an OWI, had my license revoked for 7 months, ordered for an IID installation, about $1,000 in fines, and ordered to take an 8 week group counseling program. The beginning of my program pretty much marks when I stopped drinking again.

I really want to give up alcohol. I’m a little nervous for when my counseling program ends that I’ll pick it up again, but I think that I can do it if I just keep taking it one day at a time. Alcohol had brought nothing good to me and in reality probably made life harder for me than it needed to be.  I think giving up alcohol too will help my mental health a lot, and will help me get closer to some of creative goals as a writer and musician.

I mainly went to hear peoples stories, same reason i visit this forum thats where the therapy lies for me.  Not knocking anyone who greatly benefits at all.  But the whole powerless thing and were sick for life with this disease and all that is overly negative in my opinion.  Quite simply if you dont put a mind altering substance in your body you are not powerless and thats 90% of the battle for me.   The rest just seems to be rediscovering healthy thought processes and rebuilding neural pathways where alcohol filled the void. I know easier said than done but mind over matter is a real thing. Your mind can be your best or worst enemy.  That being said i did enjoy the comraderie and everyone was welcoming which was positive. I probly will go again next week for that simple fact but i dont know if daily meetings are what i need.  I think maybe sober mtn biking or hiking, fishing, just generally getting out in nature with like minded folk who want to have sober fun destress and not always focus on drinking woukd be a more positive outlet maybe i need to join some groups like these i know they have stuff like that but if it was specifically for those in recovery i think would be a great help to folks.

It is a romantic comedy, the outcome in the film is quite hard to believe and is a bit saccharine, but there are many raw, and quite brilliant moments that capture dealing with alcohol and other substances. I particularly liked the AA group leader and his frustrations with the main character, 'Undateable John'. I think this film failed at the box office mainly because of the name, but it gave me a lot of smiles, and helped me open up to this journey. The romantic interest revolves around two people that meet in AA. The female is very captivating, so I wanted to know more about her. It turns out that life imitates art, or art imitates life. She was in fact arrested for a DUI and assaulted a Police Officer in the station and then slipped out of her handcuffs, all of course due to being drunk.

I am not hungover, I am not bringing vodka in water bottles to rehearsals, and I am not checking my watch all the time to see when I can get cut loose from rehearsal so I can hit the bar.

Even after months of telling myself that I was going to slow down (and failing), the stress of the work day led me to buy a 6 pack on my way home from work yesterday. I drank it all and this morning the nausea of a hangover led to me smoking some weed to hopefully alleviate the nausea. Now I've spent the entire day under performing at work which leads to even more stress. This has become a cycle for me which I can't seem to break out of.   


Today I'm taking a stand and consciously deciding not to drink. I don't want to wake up hungover and nauseated. I don't want to look to alcohol as a mechanism for alleviating stress. I don't want to waste my life digging myself out of my self-inflicted problems. I installed the I Am Sober app on my phone, I lingered on /r/stopdrinking and I reached out to a counseling service which my work offers.",9

I'm drinking a cold beer on a beautiful day at the ballpark.. I'm in the theater with a cold beverage and a fantastic show and wonderful companions.. I'm day-drinking at the festival and the band is fantastic,. I'm in a beach bar on the ocean enjoying draft beer loving the live music, etc.. - Of course the inevitable ultimate *reality* of my drinking is nothing like that. One of the things I recently did was to make a list which I entitled CLASSIC MOMENTS AND GREATEST HITS. The list contains about a dozen *special moments* in my drinking career (which I can even remember) where I've either put myself or others in danger, or made a complete and utter embarrassment of myself falling down drunk or blacking out or driving drunk or missing a flight or sleeping in the yard because I lost my house keys, etc., etc.. (pretty romantic stuff right?). Anyway, someone else might benefit from this school of thought-idea; make a list and keep it handy (on your phone, say) of your classic moments and greatest hits, and when you want to rationalize drinking by romanticizing it, pull the list out and review it. It diffuses the romantic fantasy pretty quickly. I'm hoping, for me, the list stops here.. oh because it will go on and on.. if I choose to let it",5

Hey, there is this close friend of mine from back in high school who moved to a different city 2 years ago after graduation to attend college there. We kept in close touch though and he regularly comes to visit.

He can be a bit quiet and awkward, but a real fun person once you get to know him. I think he is pretty lonely in his city though. Also, while we were still in high school, there was one time he broke down and admitted to me that he felt that he might be suffering from depression. I tried to comfort him and suggested that he seeks out help, but I don't think he ever did that. In part I think it's because he tends to downplay his own issues a lot of the time or feels he doesn't ""deserve"" to feel that way. He literally even apologized to me for telling me about his feelings in the first place, but I told him that he shouldn't.

A while back, we were hanging out together with another close friend of ours, and he eventually we began talking about more serious stuff as these things go. Eventually, he admitted to having woken up in the hospital after a heavy night of drinking with a friend of his, and that he feels like he can't stop drinking once he starts, but neither of this didn't make him change his drinking habits. Based on what me and the other close friend gathered we're pretty sure that since then he went from occasionally drinking too much with friends to mostly just drinking alone in his apartment. Whenever he texts with us or posts in our group chat it's pretty obvious that is pretty drunk, and he doesn't really deny it either, but still downplays his drinking. It happens a few times a week.

Could he be an alcoholic? If so, what do you even do in a situation like that? I genuinely worry about him, but I'm not sure how to approach the whole thing.",3

I don't want to drink at all. I sometimes get these urges but they go away pretty quickly. I get repulsed by the idea of alcohol and it feels kinda gross to me. Not trying to be shitty but when i'm around other people who drink i honestly feel above them and this need to drink. Which is what i needed so desperatly. (Yes some people can drink moderatly and aren't acloholics bla bla i know)

Life is still pretty shitty but instead of feeling incredibly guilty i have a little thing to be proud of. Plus i'm saving (much needed) money so theres always something. And no hangovers and puking everywhere all the time.

I'm not saying i'm now forever cured and will never relapse, it could always happen so i will be on the lookout. Please **don't get discouraged by relapsing**, i'm trying to get sober for like a year now. Everytime you relapse you learn something on what triggered you, what you can do to avoid it and a new insight on how you don't really want to drink. This ain't a ""ok im gonna be sober now"" kinda deal, it's a ""getting knocked down over and over but still getting up every damn time"" kinda deal. Keep that in mind in your very worst situations.

List of Improvements From Sobriety,"This post is for me to get my thoughts on paper and reinforce the value of sobriety, and also for those thinking about quitting/in the first few weeks, to try and give some insight into how sobriety has impacted me and maybe give you some extra help on your sober path.

I think I am around 80 days sober, so almost 90 days, we will see what my flair says when I post this, and I realized a MAJOR reduction in my anxiety and an increase in my emotional resilience. This happened Sunday when I was having a stressful day but remained extremely calm and clear headed. I have always been the happy and social person in HS and College and 6.5 years after graduation, I have finally begun returning to that state.

With a reduction of anxiety has come insane improvements in my social skills which in turn has improved my mental health. I still have crappy thoughts that increase anxiety/social anxiety but two major things have happened. My baseline anxiety, aka, anxiety that just happens without any conscious thoughts preceding it, is greatly reduced. Essentially I am not put into fight or flight response mode when confronting difficult situations. Second, I have been able to just shutout/ignore anxiety inducing thoughts and worries that I have no control over, obviously I still need to work on this but the difference is night and day.

Yes, I still can have a quick fuse and enjoy an argument way too much, but these are problems that I can now address and eliminate because I am clear headed. As recently as 10 days ago, I wanted to go back to drinking, despite 100% being a binge drinking alcoholic, but the following improvements pretty much ensure that I won't be returning to drinking. I also am excited to see how much my mental and physical health will continue to improve as I reach 180-270-360 days.

For context, I am a 30 year old dude and have been drinking for the last 9 years. My drinking turned into insane amounts of binge drinking the last 3 years.

**Improvements Over 10 Weeks:**

* 11 weeks I have lost 32 pounds (Still have 65 to go to get back the ole' 6 pack ---- the good kind)
* Going to the gym religiously again
* Quit smoking 37 days ago
* Improved skin. Still have redness in the cheeks and I hope that it will continue improving 6-9-12 months out
* Reduced anxiety and social anxiety
* Improved social skills and outlook on life
* Saved roughly 1-2 thousand dollars
* Immensely Improved my career prospects
* Eliminated depression and have a more positive outlook on life
* Clearer mind and able to think a lot more quickly on my feet.
* Improved memory
* Improved focus on my health including doing *somewhat* of a skincare routine.... this is big as I am a 30 year old dude...
* Major reduction in neediness from those around me. I know I have friends from my childhood/college and can make friends elsewhere

**Things to Continue Working On**

* Letting go of that instant gratification that drives us alcoholics
* Increasing my patience
* Lose the remaining weight I gained due to drinking (all of it)
* Quit caffeine
* Work on further reduction anxiety/anxiety creating thoughts",36

Also, I should mention, I live alone so there is no one to care if I don't clean up my messes. 

On top of the messiness, I am destroying the carpet because when I am drunk I'll ending up spilling my drink or throwing up on the carpet when I've had to much. I obviously am not trying to destroy the carpet, it is just happening. Did anyone else experience this while they were drinking?

I started this journey Sunday, Sunday had not been too difficult, even if I'm not remembering a lot of it. Got I nice 8 hours sleep going to Monday. The day wan't so bad either, had a bit of energy and then, I feel like my brain went wayhire. I felt drunk, like a never been. In the evening, I was on the street smoking a cigarette. Wanted to put the snip in the garbage. Walk up my entryway up the garbage... And I continue to move toward the garbage am at, impossible to step back. It went for a good 30 seconds, I had to ask my wife for help... Stayed in the couch a bit after since it was not yet time for the next dose. Once I took it, I went to wash myself and went to bed.

Today was off to a good start, my dose is halved and yet, I feel nothing, inside. A zombie in the house. No energy. Still staggering, double vision. I still have 3 more days to go and I'm scared this is not working.

And if it's working... Hell I don't wish that to my worst enemy.

But I don't feel any surge to drink. So there's that.

(it was a month last Saturday). I'm super proud of that. One month was my first goal and I never previously thought it was possible. So now I'm at this ""now what?"" mental place. Everything has been pretty ""typical"" I feel. I had that pink cloud, lost it, feeling better overall, etc. The adjustment period has been fine. There's been ups and downs and I've been loving the ability to face them all and deal with life.

THE ANXIETY THOOOO!

The anxiety that I get is what drove me to drugs and alcohol to begin with. Most of the time, I feel great, centered, no anxiety, and have that BDE in general. It's awesome. But there are days that I wake up so anxious and nervous that I can feel that devil creeping in and leading me to drink. 

Yesterday was one of those days. I was anxious, and being hard on myself for not snapping out of it. It's a slippery slope of self destructiveness. I'm a waiter and took the cut at work meaning I got the night off. Long story short, I recently got out of a toxic living arrangement and am at my parents place in the suburbs until I get another apartment.

So, after I took the cut at work, I was too anxious to hangout with anyone, and didn't want to go ""home"" and felt pretty alone and lost. I just wanted to feel better. I wanted this feeling to go away. So it turned into a cycle of beating myself up for not snapping out of anxiety, and weighing out pros and cons of stopping somewhere for a drink. It was like a storm in my head. Yesterdays battle was a beast. My toughest test yet. I ended up seeing Joker for the second time, (which is an awesome movie btw and fuck any critic who completely missed the mark on it) and hanging out with a friend afterwards instead, which was okay. But it wasn't that immediate shutdown and numbness that I've grown to know with alcohol. 

It was the first time that I REALLY missed it, like deep in my soul. I didn't drink, and today I'm glad about that. When I was considering it, I felt so guilty. The kind of guilt you feel when you drink in a dream. I'm wondering if anyone else has these mental battles. How do you internally deal with it? I'm seeing a therapist and this is all still new. I've done things one way for so long (drinking to numb anxiety) that when things are really bad I get into ""survival"" mode and want drink the pain away. How do I re wire?

We gush over these experiences and share with each other the beauty we find in the simple and wholesome (and I'm in the same boat). It might seem a little odd to an outsider...like, what's the big deal?

It got me thinking...why **is** this the case with so many of us? And I realized: this rivals the behavior of someone who's regained their freedom again from being held captive for a long, long time. But the thing is, we didn't think of ourselves as being held captive. We chose to enter into a relationship with our addictions and over time they slowly began to take more and more freedom from us, until we were ""shackled"" and locked up. And then it was too late to easily get away, so we had to stay. 

And after long enough, we no longer saw our addictions as our captors at all, but rather began to identify with them. Want them. Need them. Even ""love"" them! They weren't our captors, they were our best friends, our saviors even. They rescued us from the mundane, from the trivial. Do they hurt us? Yes, sometimes...but it's *only* because we did something wrong. And when we strayed too far, we ran back again and again, because the thought of living life without them was too difficult to imagine. They were the reason we were maintaining in the first place, and without them, we wouldn't survive or have joy ever again.

**Until one day,** we saw through the facade. We realized that our captors, our addictions, that we thought were holding the very keys to our happiness, were actually preventing it. And we broke free. And we got away...far enough away where we finally felt safe from them. And now...we're vulnerable, but so amazed with everything we had been missing. Food tastes better. Music sounds better. The cool breeze on our skin lights up every nerve ending to the point where it's almost too much to take. And the gratitude we feel from having escaped that twisted relationship and self-imposed prison is expressed throughout our daily lives, throughout this community. 

Yes, we celebrate the basics, because for so very long, we were being held back from enjoying them. We were being dulled and diminished to where all we could focus on is being with our captors.

Excessive alcohol use is responsible for about 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost in

the United States each year (1). Binge drinking (five or more drinks per occasion for men or four or more

drinks per occasion for women) is responsible for more than half the deaths and two-thirds of the years

of potential life lost resulting from excessive alcohol use (2).

Excessive drinking results in 3,510 deaths and 100,106 years of potential life lost each year in

Pennsylvania (1).

In Pennsylvania, 18.3% of adults reported binge drinking in 2011 (3). Data were not available for binge

drinking among high school students (4).

Excessive alcohol use cost the United States $223.5 billion, or $1.90 per drink consumed, in 2006 as a

result of lost workplace productivity, healthcare expenses, and crime (5). In Pennsylvania, excessive

alcohol use cost $8.3 billion, or $1.81 per drink (6).

I have pretty bad social anxiety and am the poster child for OCD. However, it really quickly stopped being fun time and became shit, you are making other peoples' lives harder.

My family is aware of this issue and the idea that I am making life more stressful for others that are genuinely worried for my health (I am very snippy at the moment, short with people that I love, just generally a rude ass) even when a modicum of stress arrives makes me genuinely guilty. No one deserves to be subject to that.

I don't intend to get off Prozac or increase my dose (40 mg, side effects a different story), but I was curious how other anxious, ""particular"" people are able to stop drinking.

2019-10-08 10:10:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/df0hhz/went_to_my_first_aa_meeting_last_night/,Went to my first AA meeting last night.,"So, I somehow built up enough courage to go to an AA meeting.  When I walked into the room, everyone was already seated and they were about to start the meeting.  My first thought was ""oh shit, I hope I'm in the right place"".

One guy got up after seeing that caught in the headlights look on my face and simply asked if I was here for the AA meeting.  I said yes and sat down next to him.  It was an open discussion meeting and they asked if there was any newcomers and if we wanted to share (no pressures, you don't have to share if you don't want to at all).  Me and another guy were newcomers and with both shared a bit of our stories.  Here is where things took an interesting turn.  Every share after that was people talking about their stories and what their first meeting was like.  It was amazing and the hour went by so quickly.

After the meeting I stuck around a bit to talk to people that come up to me.  Everyone said that they were glad that I came and they encouraged me to come back and go to other meetings.  They gave me a copy of the Big Book and a pamphlet that had schedules for other meetings in the area.  On the back was a list of about 15 phone numbers of people I can call if I need or want to reach out for support.

I'm sharing this for the person that like me, needs a little more support than going at it alone or only using online resources.  I don't know if AA will provide everything I need to be successful in not drinking, but I'm going to give it time and a good honest try.  I don't have any friends.  I am hoping that the fellowship aspect of AA will help provide additional support and camaraderie.

Here is an itemized list of a couple random things that I wanted to share.

1)  You don't have to share if you don't want to.  Several people there didn't say a word.  I respect their choice not to share just as they would mine.

2)  Since this was my first meeting, I didn't know any of the people there, so I don't know their backgrounds.  And quite frankly it doesn't matter.  Everyone was nice, understanding, and was genuinely happy that I came to the meeting.  We all had one thing in common and that's a problem with alcohol.

3)  Everyone did stand up at the end, held hands, and said the Lords Prayer.  I'm not a religious person, and as a matter of fact I don't even know the words to the Lords Prayer.  So I just stood there, held hands, and listened.  I know that some people are turned off by the religious aspect of it all.  But, if you can respect other people's religious ideas and just ""roll with it"" it shouldn't be a problem.  I may find other meetings later that it will become a problem, but I'll deal with that when I need to.

4)  Stick around afterwards and if possible, show up a little early.  Plenty of people there will want to talk to you, give you phone numbers, say they are glad that you came, and share a little bit about themselves.  I met several people that had 10+ years of sobriety under their belts.  I needed to see that.  I needed to see that they were happy, proud, and just normal people living out their lives.

5)  Be prepared to say ""Hi my name is lazyeyejim and I'm an alcoholic."".  You can change the wording a bit if you are uncomfortable or don't believe in the term alcoholic.  I don't particular care for the stigma around that word, but even I was surprised how easily it rolled out of my mouth.

Pro Tips

1)  Take a pen with you.  When you meet people you can make a note of who you met next to their number.  I'm horrible with names so my list of numbers have comments like ""guy who helped me find a seat"", ""guy I talked to after the meeting with 14 years of sobriety"", etc.  Just some notes.  They probably won't remember who I am if I call them, but I will be a little more comfortable calling them since I met them.

2)  I'll probably save this one until I feel really comfortable but I'm going to totally do the ""Hi my name is John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt and I'm an alcoholic."".  I just want to hear 20 or so people say ""Hi John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt"".

I've managed to get my first alcohol free day in many months and while there are difficulties, the benefits are already outweighing those!  Sorry if 4&6 are TMI!!

1.) No money spent on booze (saved £20 already)

2.) Eating more without worry because no alcohol calories (2400 cals saved - had a full fat latte, chocolate biscuits, toast with loads of butter)

3.) Spent time with my partner last night, instead of both drinking and watching TV separately

4.) Had sober sex and cuddles instead of me causing an argument and being a bitch about whatever random thought that comes into my drunken mind, followed by me sending him nasty texts and sleeping in the spare room

5.) Don't feel as tired, headachy or nauseous

6.) Slightly improved bowels (no black poop from red wine or general loose greasiness and bubbling stomach)

7.) Hygiene - cleaned my teeth, didn't sleep with contacts in, washed my face

8.) Feel slightly more in tune with my body...noticing that a text has made me feel anxious, that I'm tired and need to take a break, that I kinda feel like going for a run (not going to but feeling like it is an improvement!)

9.) Actually ENJOYED being clear headed and not fucked last night (what the hell?!!)

10.) Did some sanding and painting today, noticed my hands are less shaky and I'm less jittery.

Getting a few niggling thoughts as it gets towards late afternoon here in the UK, but I'm going to keep focussed on the benefits.  Let's see what improvements day 3 brings :)

And as I promised myself 20 days ago - I'm proceeding with a full health check-up this week. 

The hardest day was yesterday - I did blood and urine tests in the morning and had to wait until next morning for results. The level of stress was so high and I even though to have a glass of wine just to calm down. But instead of any alco I decided just to go to bed early and listen to some audiobook. And I'm proud of myself. 

Good news are: my liver together with pancreas and gallbladder are doing just fine. And almost 20+ years of drinking and especially last 10+ years of almost daily drinking did not damage them much. And the same good status for my heart and cerebral vessels.

Bad news are: my kidneys don't work as good as they could. I'm going to see my terapist next week to understand what has to be done in order to fix it. However, my kidneys were not OK since I was a child: I have some sort of kidney parenchymal thinning.

So, I'm keep on going and I will definitely not drink with you today!",10

""I wish you peace, \*sickbutterygnar\*. You're trying hard. Try easy. Take a half hour tonight and tomorrow morning, breathe for a few minutes...slowly through your nose, then let it out as fast as it wants through your mouth. Then, in your heart, recapture the moments of peace from the past (like when everyone in the house was together and happy) wish for yourself and everyone else to become that true again (and make sure to tell them you wished for them too) then just let the thoughts organize after that. The chronology of the mind is delicate when emotions are heavy. The plan will magically come together in your mind, and all you have to do is follow it with faith. Know that what you feel may not always align with what's happening, but if we're worried and questioning things, we can't hear it or feel it. If another thought brings questions and stops you in your tracks, keep your eye on the prize, maintain the planned course, but keep that pesky thought in mind for the next night's meditation.""

Basically I’ve been a daily drinker for around 2 years now. Not heavy - 1-2 beers a night, with occasional days without it and occasional days with more (just beer tho - I can’t drink hard liquor).
I’m absolutely aware that my habit is problematic, but I’m more worried about my stress/anxiety induced drinking than my daily drinking. 
I need some fixing honestly, I know that I’m self medicating with alcohol and I know that I need to get a therapist. 

Something that worries me now is that my doctor wants to test my liver. I basically get my blood checked every year because of an iron deficit. Up until now my liver was fine. Around six months ago I was in the ER with immense abdominal/back pain (turned out to be a bad urinary tract infection) - they basically made an ultrasound of my whole abdomen and my liver was fine. My blood work too (well except for some related to the infection). 

Now I’m not sure why (maybe because of hypochondriac tendencies) I’m immensely worried about the blood work that’s about to be done and that it will show that I fucked up my liver. I’m almost tempted to just not go. 
I feel like I needed to talk about it and i don’t want to worry my husband...so I came here.",4

Really I wish I could just ban alcohol commercials on my hulu account altogether, but now I can see that it wouldn't even matter. Alcohol is thrown in my face wherever I go, constantly glamorized and glorified. I just wish I could get a break from that at least.

2019-10-08 03:04:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dewh4n/one_year_down_what_i_have_learned/,One Year Down – What I Have Learned,"
Background context: 57M, been drinking for 40 years or so. Although my counter shows a year, my sober journey really started two years ago when I downloaded the Audible version of This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. I had been uncomfortable with where my drinking was going for a few years, and this book really made me think for the first time that an alcohol-free life was not only possible, but a better way to live. I also found The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober by Catherine Grey really helpful. I listened to them both several times. I put together some decent sober sprints during 2018, but kept going back to drinking when I hit the wall of anhedonia. Life just seemed so flat without getting drunk, but what I know now is that there are two things to combat this. The first is that I found I had to replace alcohol with something else. Just stopping drinking and hoping that life will suddenly become magical seems, with the benefit of hindsight, to have been rather naïve and optimistic. The second is simply *time*. Getting used to not drinking does take a while – your mind and body needs to recover and find a new way of being.

So I went on a yoga retreat very early in my sobriety, and now yoga is a really important part of my life. I also meditate almost every day and I have spent a lot of time studying philosophy, particularly Buddhism, Taoism, non-duality and Stoicism. I know I have only scratched the surface of this, but if feels to me to be important to try. I sometimes wonder if existential angst was the root cause of my problem, so maybe coming to terms with my mortality will help, and this study is moving my thinking on this. I now feel calmer, more thoughtful, and perhaps slightly less of a dick than I used to be. 

I have also had a lot of time to re-evaluate the role of alcohol in my life. On the face of it, I was just a fairly ‘normal’ drinker. Sure, I had a few crazy nights, but then so do a lot of people. I actually gave up for six months when I hit 30 because I was having horrible hangovers, but then decided I could moderate, and so drifted back. I met my wife shortly afterwards and our first 10 years of marriage were full of drunk weekends and, to be honest, few regrets. Then we had a child and it all calmed down and we became responsible parents. But then after a while, the slog of working full-time and looking after a child led to the quiet glass of wine after she went to bed, and before long, weekend drinking was back too. I started a new job which required a lot of working away. Most of the time I would only have a couple of drinks but then I started having the odd night that would turn into a session, and I would struggle through work the next day. I tried moderation and found the Moderation Management web site. I met some lovely people online, but it didn’t really work for me long-term. Overall it is the gradual creep that got me, and one day I realised that I was drinking way too much, probably 6 days a week, and really suffering for it, health-wise. We also started to have horrible alcohol-fuelled arguments, which have badly damaged our marriage. Looking back, it is amazing what I accepted as normal: hangovers at least twice a week; ever-present IBS and other digestive disorders; breaking my arm after a drunken night out; and missing work because I was too hungover to handle it.

I think I also lost confidence in myself as a human. There were so many broken promises to myself to cut down, made so fervently in the morning, but which faded like leaves in the autumn breeze by evening. My self-esteem plummeted and by the end, I truly hated myself.

So the last year has been both difficult and easy. I actually didn’t find, after the first couple of weeks, that I had mad cravings. I felt so much better that I had very little desire to drink. But finding a new way of *living* has been much more difficult. What I now realise is that alcohol became the tool I would turn to whenever I wanted to feel better. It was my go-to after a bad day, but also after a good one – you can’t feel too good can you, right? Learning to live with natural mood changes has been the hardest thing. Now I find joy in the little moments: a song that I have heard a couple of times and suddenly is the best thing I have ever heard (and having a little dance in the kitchen); watching the birds at the feeder outside our window; the peace and unity with the class I find in Savasana at the end of a yoga class; chocolate and ice cream. These moments may be fleeting, but they are *mine*. I have earned them.

I have gained so much from stopping. I sleep so much better. No more waking up at 3am and lying awake full of regret and nausea. I have a lot more energy. I was perpetually exhausted while drinking – I now see I was firing on three cylinders, at best, for years. I have lost 10kg (22lb) and I am a lot fitter. My mind feels much sharper and, I think most importantly, I am starting to feel good about myself again. Maybe for the first time ever. I have to be honest though. My default mood seems to be slightly melancholic. Maybe that’s normal, or maybe that is normal for me. I have no way of knowing. Perhaps it will improve in time, or maybe it won’t. It might be situational as I am not enjoying my work, and, as I have mentioned, home life is challenging. I am certain though, that using alcohol to fix it won’t work.
My wife still drinks, and this is a source of tension. She has always (apart from the early years of our marriage) been a more moderate drinker than me, but she does drink every day, and when she is drunk, although it is not frequent, I find it hard to be around her. Her temper becomes extremely volatile and I find myself walking on eggshells around her. She has lost her drinking companion, and this is hard for her. I completely get that. I hope we can repair our marriage, but it may be irreparably damaged. We are trying. 

I still come to this sub often. It reminds me of the struggle we are all facing, and how amazing people are for dealing with it, often starting from far worse places than me. I find it encouraging that there are a lot of people in their 20s and 30s who are giving up. Please learn from my experience and stick with it! So, sorry this has been so long, and I thank you all for being here for me, and for each other, I thank Annie Grace and Catherine Grey for their fabulous books, and wish you all peace and happiness.

Give the Sinclair method a try.,"I've been a drunk since I started drinking, granted a bit later than most people. The first drink might start slow, but eventually I'm obsessed with the next one. And the next. Planning trips up to the bar and how to still get served not looking too wasted. Nobody would guess I'm a successful young professional by day.

Other hobbies and activities started becoming less interesting. Why read a book on Saturday night? Getting drunk is this crazy fun world where I can do, be, say anything, and everything is full of color.

Until the hangover. Laying in bed all day trying to figure out where I lost my wallet, who I texted, all while laying in the bathtub in the dark waiting for the sun to go down and to finally sleep well.

Why do we keep going back?

Because the neurochemical reward is immense. Your primate brain controls you more than you'd imagine. We turn those powerful signals into rationalizations. And boom, drunk again. 

When we abstain the reward pathways are still there and strong as ever. Other hobbies can't come close. It's not a moral failing. You are not weak for listening to your body. 

Naltrexone, taken an hour before drinking, makes the experience far less pleasurable. Over time you just stop caring about alcohol. Staying sober isn't some great victory. It's a non issue. But you do need to drink on the naltrexone for your brain to lose its romance with alcohol. 

You can find telemedicine doctors that will write you a script. The drug itself is generic and cheap. And you only use it before drinking.

If you are having trouble filling the void alcohol leaves behind, seriously consider giving the method a shot. Watch the documentary One Little Pill on Amazon prime. 

It's helped me so far, hopefully it can help someone else.",8

I attended a wedding in Kentucky at the oldest bourbon distillery in the country. 

The day before the wedding was also the first time meeting most of my partner's extended family and we all stayed in the same hotel. When we arrived, my partner and I quickly grabbed food while exploring the area. We agreed to meet up with the 10+ members that were sitting down for happy hour a couple blocks away. We walked to the bar -- bars are a non-trigger for me, especially as there was food on the table, and TV's on. I think I was drinking regular water at that point (gotta stay hydrated kiddos), when across the table I hear a voice shouting out loudly over the noises of the bar:

""_MrJones! What are you drinking!?!"" 

In slow motion, like dominoes falling, every head at the table snapped in my direction, looking at what I was holding in my hands. (maybe I exaggerated, but fuck, I'm triggered like hell.) 

Flushed, I mumbled back, ""uauahhg, uhh.... uhhhh.....mm, just some water."" 
Like electricity it was thrust into my hand from across the table -- my drink, my poison. And their eyes. Still, staring at me.

I put the whiskey to my lips, and tilted the glass ever so slightly. I tilted it, tasted the rim, maybe 3-4 drops, and my face puckered up like I had eaten a sour candy. I didn't like it. I handed the drink back the other end of the table to a little bit of laughter, which I joined in on. 

After about 10 minutes, I was feeling so triggered. It came back so fierce -- that voice that said it would be okay to drink again. I recognized it as a stupid thought, let it pass, and drank more water. A little bit later I whispered to my partner about how a little bit too much splashed and how it was affecting me in an interesting way. Later we talked about it. 

I'm not resetting over a few drops, but I will double down and spend more time thinking about better strategies for exiting a situation like that. 

The funny part is that the original person who sent the drink over to me from across the table was just trying to be sweet because there was an extra drink brought to the able going to waste, and he saw that I didn't have anything in front of me. 

The next night was the wedding.

There was an open bar. I ran drinks for my partner and myself--She had an alcoholic beverage, and then mine -- A tonic with lime. While serving mine, the bartender asked me if I wanted the small cup, or a larger one (fucking awesome bartender to give me the choice! Sometimes I'm thirsty, and sometimes I just want to blend in). 

I took the small glass, tipped her well, and came back all night. She learned the order immediately and flashed me a grin whenever she saw me coming. She later told me that this too was her drink of choice too. 

It was a lovely event, and the ceremony and reception were both beautiful, and I fully enjoyed it.

I’ve been telling myself for months that I’m ok. That I just like to get drunk a few times a week. Over the past maybe 12-15 months I find myself on my porch, downing 1 too many white claws or bud lights or whatever it may be. It helps my depression. My anxiety. I know it’s wrong but i can’t stop. My SO of over 10 years knows I’m going down slowly. 

I can’t really pinpoint the reason I started “alone drinking”. I guess it’s not always alone, because I’m always up for a 12-pack at a friends house if we’re having fun. But lately I’ve begun sneaking. When SO is away I’ll go to the drive thru and maybe brave a 6-pack to go with a pack of cigs (I’ve been smoking forever, I don’t view it as exclusive). Then I go home and tell myself that the 6 is all I’m drinking. I might sneak out and go get another 6-pack later. Then when he gets home I’m plastered. So far this hasn’t affected my work life other than the fact that I’m hung over 3 mornings a week. The weird thing is that I can go a day or two without even thinking about drinking. But once I have free time i start doubting myself. Maybe I can just have a few. A few turns into 10. And I’m drunk and going to bed early. 

I’m not sure what’s “made” me start doing this. I know it’s slowly getting out of hand and taking over my life. I find myself making excuses for why I can’t go out somewhere, then sneaking to the gas station and picking up booze. 

I tell myself “I’m not drinking tonight”, then find myself 7 beers deep for no reason whatsoever. It’s not social. I can go out, have a few beers, and come home. But if I’m by myself, I will find myself slowly climbing that drunken hill. 

I can’t pretend I’m not concerned anymore, but i don’t know how to stop doing this to myself. I already feel like shit most days due to other health issues (acid reflux, anxiety, etc) but this isn’t helping. 

I honestly don’t know how to change without something drastic, and I don’t want to admit I have a problem. Advice? Help?",7

What do I love about not drinking?

I love that I have clarify, more focus and energy. Anxiety is substantially less/I’m able to deal with it more effectively. My skin is better, I weigh less and care for myself in a really deep and real way. It’s something I wasn’t able to do well before.

I also love that I have this strength to get me through anything and everything. If I can stop drinking, make it through the holidays, moving, new job, new state, finish major projects, etc, all without drinking, I can do anything. That means, when I have a craving or desire to drink, I know I can get through it because I have before.

I did 8 years with no alcohol, then fell off again hard a year or two ago. Kinda lost track.

Long story short: born to a fucked up family, then *everyone* died, then wife nearly died, cat died, car got repossessed, home business tanked because wife was sick, utilities cut off, home of 20 years went to foreclosure. Got a diagnosis of having PTSD and depression and anxiety, took pills of different kinds, nothing worked longer than 90 days. Kept going back to vodka to cure panic attacks and hopelessness.

Well, all that is over now. I have no more ashes to scatter. No more belongings to box up or sell. No more utility companies to beg for more time from. No more work table covered with half-finished commissioned work that I'm too anxious to sit and work on by myself. No more constant ringing phone. No more wondering where our next meal will come from. No more food banks and DES office lines. No more explaining myself.

I took a major hit to our life. I live with my wife's family with what little possessions we got out with. I have a job clicking numbers all day and get paid a ridiculous amount of money for it (by my previous standards at least) and I carpool to work.

I went from all the stress in the world to only having to roll out of bed and contribute part of my paycheck to paying my MIL for her space and bills, and getting my wife to her doctor visits. That's all.

I'm still anxious, still depressed at times. I feel terribly displaced at times. But it's all a lot better.

I feel like I crawled out of hell to be honest. And I think I left my cravings down there.

It's been months now and I almost never think about drinking. I've had four work functions where my coworkers and bosses were drinking beer, doing shots, offering drinks to me, and there was no reason in the world for me to say no, but I said no, honestly not wanting the sensation of inebriation more than I wanted the pleasure that comes with it.

My MIL's house is full of alcohol that nobody there ever touches. Bottles of wine in every cabinet, gifts going back decades. Gins and whiskeys and bourbons. Still, my ""don't touch that, it's not yours"" muscle flexed a lot harder than my ""ooh free booze"" muscle and that was also a new sensation for me. I haven't been tempted since.

Right now without my addictions and stress plaguing me I really feel adrift at times. I've broken down crying by myself at work a few times for no reason at all, just sudden, like a hiccup or other involuntary release. At night I pace, but not out of anxiety, out of restless wonder what I'm doing to do with my life, now that I have one again.",23

I went into alcohol detox voluntarily last Thursday and was discharged today. I elected not to transfer into the facility's 30-day inpatient program, chiefly because money is tight for my husband and me, and I have to get back to work (I freelance, so no work, no pay). 

I did inpatient last year, and at that time I had been assigned to a young women's unit (not a good decision; I'm 48), and it ended up being catty, cliquey, and stressful. I bailed a few days early because I was so depressed and homesick.

Anyway, during a session the other day, I mentioned my intention to do their IOP program. The counselor referred to it as ""I'm Only Pretending."" I was stunned that someone affiliated with this place would dis their program like that. I should have said something, but I held my tongue.

Today, I read my discharge papers which say ""Prognosis: POOR,"" mainly because I declined inpatient treatment. They say it may improve if I participate in IOP and all that, but that was another slap in the face.

I'm just feeling really defeated. I thought I was doing the right thing. I should end this by saying I have never been keen on AA, and I know they're going to force that on me in IOP.

Anyway, I would appreciate any insight you folks may have. IWNDWYT",3

What is your story?  How did you do it?  What do you think about it?

The reason I ask is because I see stories on here every day about how people took time off from drinking, felt better about it and gave moderation a try.  Of course they then talk about how they slowly fell back into their old ways and couldn't maintain moderation, and were soon back to drinking heavily.  I fall into that category as well.  I went 30 days sober over the summer and then decided to give moderation a try, which worked OK for about 2 weeks and then I was back into my previous routine.  About 3 weeks ago I decided to try complete sobriety again, and I'm gonna roll that into a ""sober October"", but I'm not sure I want to drink again.

I can't deny, the physical benefits of sobriety are great, and I'm not sure that I want to drink again.  But the first time I drank after that 30 days, I woke up and felt fine, it was just doing it several more times in the following weeks that kicked me back into my old routine.

There has to be something I can do that I'm not doing.

I have no issue stopping and staying stopped for some time. But then my resolution fades. Something twigs in my mind and it sneaks back in. Ground Hog Day. Very recently I was once again actually thinking I could drink a few here and there. I bought a six pack and drank it. A few days later I bought another six pack and drank that. Nothing for a few days, then I bought a carton and decided I would drink one a day to reinforce my new good drinking habit. I was an in control, normal drinker! Then I started drinking a couple a day. This was all over the the last two weeks or so. Then BOOM I drank about 14 of those beers in one night, a Wednesday night. Then I drank subsequent days because I couldn't function and felt like death. Those subsequent days felt like torture but I had a to get to a point where I had the resolve to quit and the time to myself to curl up in a ball and eat sugary things.

So the hard-to-accept point to this story is that for some days over the last two weeks I literally, honestly thought that my issues with drinking were resolved . I thought that now that I was out of a toxic relationship I had been in I could drink ""responsibly"". This seemed completely rational to me! I honestly questioned my thinking and it seemed legit. What the actual fuck?!!

It's ridiculous. Literally hundreds of times - I'd say I'm into the hundreds at this point - I've had to relearn this lesson. Right now as I sit here I cannot fathom what the fuck - how could I suddenly not see the truth that my life is SO MUCH BETTER without imbibing ethanol? How many times do I have to learn the same fucking lesson? How many important relationships do I have to destroy? It's so fucking embarrassing. And it should be.

Previous to this little binge I spent 3 months or so completely poison free *happily and without struggling.*

So here I am again trying to work out what the fuck I can do differently. It's nowhere new.

Then last night I remembered something. About 15 years ago I successfully gave up smoking after many, many attempts. One of the things I did differently that time was I made a point of every single day taking 10-15 mins to pause and write out a bunch of reasons why smoking was terrible, why I didn't want to be smoker, etc. I wouldn't just copy, I would try to fill the page from my thoughts and also try to find some new reasons - however small. Some days I'd have energy and be right into it but some other days when I was tired I'd just look at previous days for hints and re-write them in new words again. The point would be to get it done every day, but try to give it some mental energy. The idea is to visit the motivations every day and to reinforce constantly. Reprogramming the subconscious I suppose? I guess the technicalities don't matter. But I did successfully quit smoking and a few months later cigarettes truly ceased to be an addiction for me and have never been a thought since.

So that's what I'm going to do. I have this nice new hard backed notebook here I will literally fill with my daily re-thinks, minimum one page (but no limit). I have an alarm set for 7:30pm every night because I can take 15 mins at that time, no excuses. I'll fill this book and then I'll fill another.

I'm just so fucking over this. I want to move forward with my life and have a new relationship not scarred by this utter bullshit and craziness.",24

But I've came to a point where the negatives out weighted the positives, and I don't want to drink ever again, I only drank periodically until 7 month ago where I was in the same situation I was now, I haven't got drunk in 3 month and stopped codeine at that time, but it was boring so I decided fuck it, and re-began drinking.

It got pretty bad pretty quick because I thought I would stabilize myself at 2 bottles per week, so at the beginning I was like ""I'll threat myself, before the monotony sets in"" and I drank every other day, more and more each time, until I realized that the ""exception"" wasn't very exceptional anymore I tried to cut it back to two bottles a week, which I managed to do, then I cut it back to a bottle a week, and along the way there was plenty of time where I told myself that it'll be my last drink because some of the negatives really started to appear (bad memory, cloudy mind and unstable mood mostly), to some of you that maybe not seem like much and it probably isn't I've read stories about people drinking 10L of alcoholic beverage every day, but I had put up some limits which were: don't drink two day in a row and no more than a bottle every time I drink (which I haven't always respected) even though I had no physical symptoms of alcoholism, my naturally fucked up mental made it so that during every week there was that one little thing that I just couldn't get off my mind, so I drank even I though I told myself I'll stop.

But here we are now, my last sober period at the beginning of the year, was mostly a break from codeine, because I used to drink way less often but way more alcohol at that time but still less alcohol overall that I've drank this year, and at that time my mind got really cleared, and I realized how much codeine (& alcohol) made my mind cloudy, and now I've stopped again, but I don't feel that clear anymore, I've read people saying that you could come out of an 10yrs opioid addiction the same you entered (getting past the withdrawals and cravings of course) unlike alcohol that fucks you up permanently to some degree, I think they were right, sometimes it still feels like I've got a vegetable for a brain (I go to a room to do something but then I forget on the way what I was supposed to do and just stand in the room thinking ""Why the hell am I here ?"", that used to happen a lot while I drank, now it happens less often but still more often than before my drinking period).

And the main thing now is, I feel like crap, and I want to drink, because not only is this boring, it sucks too, while I was drinking or getting high, it feels like a roller coaster, at first you get high, then you go down and after a while you're starting to realize you're going up and down but down overall, so it's now about not going down too much rather than getting high, it sucks more than being sober, but at least you get that ""excitement"" of going up and down, now I am just down, not as much as I used to be, but not as high as I used to be either, it's just boring, it just sucks, when that happened before I used to do codeine and alcohol, I just distracted my mind from the real world, I just watched series played video game, anything to forget about it, but it just bored me even more, and I'm still bored now, and while I was drinking I thought I'd would stop then get my life back on track, but now that I'm sober, I just sit behind my computer all day, watching myself waste my life away, I don't even have an excuse to hide behind, and I know I'll forget about it if I have a drink, but I can't even have a fucking drink.",4

This is the true blessing of sobriety.  9 years ago I could never have imagined a day like yesterday in my life.  A day I could just experience with serenity, peace, and happiness.

Saw another girl trying not to retch in a sink in a bathroom, a cleaning lady was standing off to the side like "" you better not puke in that sink!"" Her face was shiny and smudged and red, her hair matted, she was drunk but she looked sick.

The rest of the drinkers were just loud, repetitive, kind of silly but not in a clever or fun way, like goofy toddlers who went too long without a nap.

The event I went to was fun. I did think about drinking before it started but I knew it would turn into me chasing the drink all night, not paying attention to the show and feeling like shit.

Its nice to go out and not be concerned at all with altering myself to a sufficient level. Im ok just how I am! I have more fun, and while I am tired today I'm not hungover. Plus I remember everything I said and did.

This past weekend was my friend’s wedding that upon setting my “6 month sober goal” was going to be the day where I was allowed to have a drink. BUT I didn’t want it. I was sober the whole time. FUCK one drink. I’ll be damned if I’m gonna ruin my progress and healthier self in order to fit in with the wedding crowd. I told the bride beforehand that I wouldn’t be drinking and she was obviously more than ok with it. 

I don’t even have an urge to drink. Not even the slightest inclination. The groom had been gifted an expensive bottle of bourbon (which used to be my favorite) and everyone in the bridal party was drinking it. Maybe for a half millisecond I thought “ just sip it, taste it, and spit it out”. But quickly realized I didn’t even want that. Or crave it. Why waste it? It was just that flash of social environments and their added pressures that popped up in my head. 

I feel better sober. I think better sober. I am kinder-to myself and others- when I’m sober. I like being sober.
I am growing into a better version of my self. And I like her a lot. Also grateful for my haggard drunk self that was once the wild party girl she was. Because there is no light without dark. Growth. Strength. Courage. Determination. All of these things that feel MILLIONS of times better than a shitty next day hangover or drunken regrets ever will.

What started this...  After a long 12 hr day at work I was exhausted and I'll I wanted to do was drink my fireball chain smoke and listen to my audio book.  Its 9:30 I should get to enjoy my Friday, especially knowing I have to work a Saturday for the first time in years.  So that is what I am doing!! My husband is still working and then stopping at a friends house to help them move some furniture so I know he won't be home until very late.  My daughter is 3 blocks over at the Homecoming football game with friends and I expect her to be walking home in the next half hour or so.  

HAHHAAHHA nope, my daughter decides to be a teen for once. 

Here I am getting drunk and the dogs start going wild.  Daughter has told her friends parents that her dad will take them home after the game??? (Umm your dad isn't home child)  Well this parent decided to stop by my house to give me her number and information huh what?  How?  How did you get my address.  I have no idea what my daughter told you.  I assume she talked to her father so I play stupid and pretend to be as sober as possible, and just roll with it.  Call daughter who doesn't answer hmmmmm.. 5 minutes later she strolls up with 2 teen girls, one she doesn't even know the name of.   GREAATTT.... I confront her about why I have parents showing up at my house.  No answer she has no idea why they came here or even how they got my address...... CLEARLY LYING, since she now knows none of her plans are going to work.  I tell these teens girls call your parent's because what ever my daughter promised you isn't happening.  I have no idea why she told you any of the things she said without asking first.  Mother from earlier comes back grabs both teens and its done. 

Me though, I am not done.  I feel ashamed that I was to wasted to understand exactly what was going on around me.  To wasted to communicate with this parent and these random teens.  To wasted to deal with the situation at hand.  To wasted, a little to consistently. Tired that it keeps happening. ....

Been looking at this group for a while now, hoping that being part of a community can help with staying strong through it and being accountable to myself and others.  I've come a long ways since 3 years ago in terms of mentality towards it (read This Naked Mind, Alchohol Experiment, etc. in beginning), but it still sucks to feel like starting over again.  This last week was pretty rough, the most I've drank in about 3 months.  Anyways, I'm excited to start on this journey alongside others!  IWNDWYT",15

Then I got a message from an old friend that wanted to get together for a few beers, I mentioned I was focusing more on health these days.  He laughed and said, 'well you can have a few beers, right?'  We haven't met up yet but it got me thinking.  Why wasn't I having a few beers?  It's Octoberfest.  And *by chance*, over the last 60 days I've gotten myself into almost the best shape of my life, and have been a much more regular figure at my old dojo.  *Somehow* my business has also improved and began to run more smoothly, myself and my few sub-contractors have had the best months we've had in years.  And *not sure where I found the time*, but I've made great progress on a large remodelling job to my house.  It was definitely cause to celebrate, and there was no need to deprive myself of one of the small rewards in life that brings a little bit of pleasure.  Right?

One week later.  Wrong!  Most of you know the drill.  It took no time at all, literally, for me to find myself back in that dark, miserable, aching place again.  When I truly realized it, I just stopped for a moment and stared at a wall.  I'm not sure why it is that I forget everything after a few months and think it'll be different.  I'm never going to *have a few beers* over a weekend.  The idea of buying a six-pack without a pint to go along with it is absurd to me.  In just one week my face is now fat again, every joint aches, my digestive system is NOT working correctly, I eat poorly, mornings are hell and I just want to make it through the day.  So, I'm starting over at day one again.  Stronger than ever I think, but also feeling so sad at the setback.  Because I knew better this time, and I let myself be fooled.  Whether I make it 2 months, 2 years, or 2 decades, I have to remember that I will always be a full-blown alcoholic that will lose everything I care about if I do anything except 100% complete abstinence.

I’ve been drinking most days for over 15 years... I don’t know really how it started, but I’d have a couple of beers after work and that was it..

Fast forward to now and it’s at least a bottle of red wine, usually a bottle and a half...

I stop for a day or two but then get back into it. My partner loves her wine but she has a half glass then stops whereas I don’t and can’t . 

If I stop then watching her have a glass inevitability leads me to wanting one and so it begins again...

Issues created by the booze...no particular order and probably the tip of the iceberg...

Always waking at 1 or 2am
Getting into stupid arguments about nothing 
Wanting to get home so I can have a wine
Lack of mental sharpness 
Putting on weight 
The cost

And so on and so on...

I’m having trouble stopping and thought talking about it might kick off the process..

Anyhow good luck all and thanks for reading...

Just had a thought that I always sign off everything with “cheers”, I think I’m going to change that...

There’s such a huge misconception with alcohol.

Unfortunately the bad news is I did drink alone last night, to excess, and woke up feeling like an alien or as though I had this terrible secret that no one knows about. I can't say that I won't drink again because I have events coming up at the end of the month/next month, and I know that once the alcohol is out of my system today, I will forget this feeling. But I can say that I really, really want to stop getting drunk on work nights and on my own. I am just about holding it together but I feel like I am on the precipice of something that I do not like. 

I'll be honest that reaching out here is just a way to get some small comfort. I have two weekends ahead that I have no plans for and I intend to either make sober plans or stay home and chill. Just those 2 weeks. Then we reassess.

Today's experiment.,"Hi r/sd, I know this is not an original idea! But one I'd been overlooking, as I mistakenly thought journalling was pretty much a similar process of seeking truth and filtering ideas and motivation. But journalling is much less fruitful in my experience. I've recently found a good way of overcoming all this inner turmoil I have around drinking / not drinking, is simply to turn over the problem to god and discuss it briefly and openly with this being in my own head. Then I find truth and clearer perception bubbles to the surface and I receive peace. 

Today I just asked myself some questions before god (who I just see as a source energy of love and power) what it was I doubted: him/ her, or myself, or my ability to communicate with him/ her. The answer boiled down to none of those things and I reached the point of committing to not drinking for an hour. And it doesn't feel 'hard' to do. So I commit to entering this prayer state hourly today. As I have a few triggers in store for me I originally had very little hope of surmounting. I'll also pray over these triggers, which are work and social related. I'll be back with an update on my progress👍 Hope this can potentially help you as much as it seems to be doing me.

Update 1: nearly 3pm. I'd marked the time out til 3 so far, no danger there. But I was getting some serious doubts about whether I really wanted to be sober later today. So I asked myself and God if I doubted god? No. Life? No. Myself? Again, no. So I'm still not drinking.... it's a perspective of wholeness and question asking and continually questioning my doubts.

Update 2. Praying definitely really helping and I am feeling more encouraged in myself as I can extricate my energy from worrying/ feeling hungover. So I'm happier and can focus on being myself not my alcoholic self. I am sitting in the cafe in the hostel I stayed in last night which I think is currently selling alcohol. Normally the whole set-up would be a trigger, but I'm fine. :) There's no white knuckling going on, just peace.",5

There are no other real benefits - it might feel like it’s fun or relaxing for an hour but it actually creates more problems than it solves. 

I really want to stop, everyday I want to just get a day off the booze and wake up feeling less awful but at 4/5pm I always cave in. I’m a huge sucker for short term relief over long term gain.

I went out with my coworkers last night and was kinda “challenged” on how much we could drink. Which my alcoholic brain was like “let’s drink everything” so within like three hours I have six rum and cokes and brown out. Like bits and pieces are there but not much. I work at a bar and it was open for after hours. I bought a bottle of Chardonnay though apparently. “Bought”. I have no idea if I paid for it.

The dude who challenged me was in the bathroom for an hour as well. So I guess that could have been me.

Anyways, I’m pretty out of control recently. Been waking up in my work clothes, sick, unable to eat then binging again every night. Texting French boys how hot they are and such. Not Gucci, and I’m trying to muster the courage to make a change at 25 before I get older and become a drunk bum at 7 11 brown bagging an old English 😒

But that was a little dark for a second, so the night ended with my famously weird drunk habit. So, whenever I get really really trashed, I decide I want to reach my bed as fast as possible and I DEAD ASS run like Forest Gump, arm thing and all. 

And well, I apparently did that at 4am up the stairs and busted my ass. Also apparently, waking my roommate and terrifying him and making him think the house is haunted. So he’s pretty pissed and amused at the same time. And I’m pretty embarrassed.



TLDR; A girl is basically living life like Princess Bean, Forest Gump ran up some stairs and almost got ghostbusted. Also hitting on French boys for some reason . Need to make a change due to it starting to really affect my health and become embarrassing",6

However, I’ve been falling into the habit of stalking myself on social media and it’s been truly ruining me. I see photos of myself from when I was skinnier and seemingly prettier, hanging out with people I no longer speak to, and it tricks my brain into thinking I was happier then. I start to feel as though the old me was the better me and I’ve fucked up everything. Social media makes me feel like my present isn’t good enough. Does anyone relate?? I know I need to stop going on these apps, but it’s like I’m addicted to stalking my past. It’s definitely an obsession with self that I can’t shake.",5

I had two bottles of wine (which is the norm on a Saturday night), and for the first time in a long time I got sick. Really sick. Hugging the bathroom garbage can for a good ten minutes sick. 

Today, I woke up at a little before noon and spent the whole day on my friend's couch feeling dizzy and nauseous and sore. It was far beyond any hangover I've ever experienced. 

I realized today that in the past week I've gone through at least six bottles of wine, if not more. I've been feeling tired and awful all week and today was the worst of the lot. 

My drinking has become a physical and financial burden and it needs to stop. I found this sub tonight and I'm hoping it can help me. I didn't drink tonight and I'm making the conscious decision not to drink tomorrow. Or the next day. Or the next.

Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's Monday!  Well, good news, I survived my talk at the support group yesterday and it was fine. So, on to Monday and I have the day off work as my new stove is being delivered today!  Hooray, I will be able to cook again!  In my drinking days, I would have worked around not having a stove due to not wanting to take the time to shop or would have just put it on the credit card no matter the cost.  This time, I shopped around, found what I wanted and then saved the money so that I could pay cash.  Baby steps I guess, but I'm proud of myself for finally acting like a responsible adult :) Hopefully, I'm not the only person who used to take the easy way out of situations while drinking.  I will not drink with you today (but I might bake some cookies)!",75

Hey, that's freaking awesome! BUT I think it's dangerous for people reading these posts to assume it all ends up as roses and rainbows. A few years back I had a good amount of sobriety and decided (around this time of the year) that I shouldn't have to be a recluse and watch football games on Sunday alone at my house. I wanted to go to the bar with my buddies and enjoy sports with others, the way things are meant to be. I just had to do it sober. Now while awkward at first, I managed to sip on my diet coke and stave off the desire to take shots with everyone. I even told people I was staying sober ""to get in better shape"" instead of the truth that I was unable to control my drinking. 

The first few weeks were great, not a single slip up! But slowly I felt myself normalizing their behavior and doing mental gymnastics to talk myself into thinking maybe theres a way I can drink safely again. And eventually I DID end up drinking. A few months down the line I'm back into the same wretched cycle of drinking and hangovers with all the anxiety and shame that accompanied it before. Yet to make it EVEN WORSE I felt like I wouldn't be able to get sober because after having months of sobriety I was unable to maintain it. What would be different the next time around?

People are quick to post their success story of going to the party and staying sober but not many say weeks later ""hey, disregard all that shit I wrote earlier. I'm miserable and drunk again."" Now I don't even tempt myselfe with this shit, I'm not spiritually fit enough to try to attempt to hang out at a bar sober or anything like that.

I don't have a car and soon I won't even really have any days off work as the busy season is coming.

After 20 or so days sober I felt myself starting to negotiate with myself. Stating to convince myself that if I can reach 100 days that will be a great achievement and I will re-assess then. I mean, if i can make it 100 days i don’t have a problem, right! 

Alcohol is so sneaky and manipulative. It does everything to work it’s way back into my life. The memory of its terrible impact conveniently fades away leaving me believing that it’s ok to get back on the horse.

Im sure some people can have a healthy relationship with alcohol. I know plenty of people that can have a glass of wine and it compliments their evening. They enjoy it and then stop at one, perhaps two.........That’s not me. Never was. I simply don’t comprehend why you would ever have just one or two drinks. 

Anyway, I read that line on this forum and everything shifted. I realized that I can’t actually ever remember a time where booze was a healthy and balanced part of my life. It’s always being a disruptive, negative and an unpleasant experience for all around me. 

So day 35 here we are and feel good about many more days to come. It’s stopped being a fight for me and I now feel a lot more positive about a sober future.

And also I read (from potentially a bad source) that if a addict suffered from kindling in withdrawals once, they will for every successive relapse. But, I've always wanted to know if after so much time has passed since I've had a drink, if it's ok for me to take NyQuil. I'm asking now cause I have the flu. I suspect the AA answer would be no alcohol whatsoever, in any form (I could be wrong about that), but tbh AA never worked out for me, so I'm hoping for a more scientific/biological answer of will taking NyQuil trigger kindling/withdrawals again.

We've always known alcoholism can run in families so we would assume there was a genetic component. It looks like they are narrowing it down a bit.

What I found interesting was the bit about how a certain gene causes disregulation of gaba, making those people more anxious in general. I think that's a lightbulb moment for a lot of us. I know when I first started drinking I loved how normal it made me feel. Even the days after a huge bender I would feel like shit but I always felt more level...like normal in a way. 

Itll be interesting to see what kinda research comes out of this. I'd love to see them come up with something that helps the anxiety without the addictive properties or side effects. In effect making us more ""normal""",29

Today is not one of those days, however. What set me off is learning that my ex de facto boyfriend, who said he was ""too messed up"" to fully commit to me after a year and a half of dating, is engaged to his girlfriend of all of five minutes (ok, maybe more like 8 or so months, but I rest my case). I'm pretty sure he started seeing her while he was still seeing me...one day he just stopped answering my texts, and I never heard from him again. Doesn't help that she's loaded and looks like a supermodel. When I figured it out, I nearly drank myself to death and never fully processed it. Now it's all coming back up and I'm losing my mind. I'm feeling all of the feelings and WOW it is way more than I'd known as a drinker.

It really sucks because, in all other aspects of my life, I'm doing really well. I'm reaching my career goals and have been really physically healthy. I'm generally pretty confident with myself. But today I'm overwhelmed with feelings of inadequacy. The thought of ever opening up to anyone again seems impossible, even though I desperately crave that connection. Rejections from middle school are surfacing. I'm thinking about my mom's pain in her emotionally-abusive marriage. I'm even reliving the day I had to put my old dog down. Everything I've squashed down with alcohol is coming back up at once. This is exhausting. 

I usually do yoga, meditation or exercise to engage my body as a way to calm the mind. But I don't want to do any of that today. I think I actually just want to sit and wallow. I'm working on being okay with that. I have a therapist, but I probably need a new one as I usually feel worse after our sessions (probably the subject of another post entirely).

It’s more longing for the good old days when I’d get smashed hanging out with my friends. That was fun for maybe the first two hours of a drinking session and I miss it! The problem is that I couldn’t quit when I needed to and would end up talking shit and alienating myself from people, drive home and drink until I passed out. That was if it was a good night, maybe mix some hard drugs in if I was really in a bad frame of mind. Get up at 5 or 6 am because I couldn’t sleep, and start drinking by myself again. “Good old days” my ass!

2019-10-06 20:16:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/debsde/am_i_an_alcoholic/,Am I an alcoholic?,"Hey all,

I'd say I have a toxic relationship with alcohol but I'd like to figure out if I can be considered an alcoholic or not.

I'm 23yo, I have been drinking heavily with my high school friends since I was 16 and also with my family (wine, I'm french...) . From 16 to 20, I have been drinking in excess a lot with friends, partying, blacking out...

I just can't stop. I never have enough.

I can be alcohol-free for 3-4 days if I really want to (event tough I am weak sometimes and end up getting a beer on a Monday night after work to relax). When I drink by myself during the week, I usually have just 1 beer or 1 glass of wine. I consider that fine.

However, in a social environment, I need to try really really hard not to drink too much. Just because I'm always thirsty for ""one more drink"". When I am with work colleagues, I'm almost not enjoying the moment just because my mind keeps thinking ""don't drink too much, don't be too drunk"".

The sober-me that wakes up in the morning is often ashamed of the drunk-me from last night, whether I haven't done anything embarrassing/off-limit or blacked out. This is very toxic to me and I don't know how to overcome that. This guilt feels awful and makes me hate myself and my life for a short period of time. 

When I wake up in the morning, I'm so often thinking ""please, stop drinking, you'll do yourself a favor"" but once I have 1 drink, I can't stop and always find excuse to have one more.

Basically, Is me finding excuses a form of alcoholism? I am highly considering stopping drinking because I just can't control myself and always end up wasted, but I am not sure I can/want to. I have quit smoking a year ago, started working out, feeling good about myself, but alcohol is my only ""guilty pleasure"".

I also want to stop drinking because alcohol makes me self-sabotage opportunities with girls, talk too much and gives me that reputation of the guy that ""can't handle alcohol"". But my main excuse is that I won't have fun anymore if I stop.

My friend only had tough messages.  Total abstinence for ever is the only chance of success, without AA you will fail, and that graveyards, jails and lunatic asylums are full of those people who think they are strong enough to tackle their alcoholism by themselves.   Something unforeseen or unexpected will blow me off course and I will drink again and it ultimately it will end badly.  Period.  Blunt, bleak and demoralising on one level, but he totally believes it and so I suppose he is just giving me his ‘tough love’ view and he tells me that all the empirical evidence supports his view.

I used to use it go to sleep. I’d drink for stress. I’d drink just because I felt I needed it. 

For the past 2 months, I’ve gradually got down to drinking once a week. I think this is due to going to the gym 6 days a week and eating much better than I did when I was drinking. 

What I’m trying to get at is that when I had my drinks yesterday, it was awful. I hated every shot I took. I wasn’t enjoying it like I used too. I went to bed and woke up with the worst taste in the my mouth. 

I hope that anyone who is still struggling with quitting to drink is that you can do it over time.  If you make some active changes in your life, you can stop drinking eventually. It will be hard at first, but it will be worth at the end.

I was tempting death. Rehab pulled me off that ledge. Not only did learn how to manage addiction, I learned how to manage my emotions. My life. 

I was happy and healthy for six months, then, on a trip to Seattle I slipped. I was visiting a boyfriend and I thought it would make me more fun and comfortable (both of which he already saw in me).

This “slip” led to 4 binge weekends. All four of them occurred during mental dips, the downs that I was taught how to manage, but wouldn’t this time. 

I saw myself. I saw myself becoming everything I hate. Always sad, always tired, always lying, always full of excuses. No, I could not go back.

So, I stopped. I started going to more meetings. I forgave myself for the relapse because I knew beating myself for it would only lead me to drinking. That shame and guilt, I couldn’t live it anymore.

I am 3 months sober, and I am reaching my one year mark. Do I celebrate? Am I a fraud? I know my family will acknowledge the day I entered rehab. Knowing them they’ll turn it into a party. Can I forgive myself and acknowledge how I have progressed? Or do I re-start the clock?

I’ve been drinking around 10-15 cans of carling basically almost every day for just over 4 years  now. It’s ruined my life and damaged so many of my friendships and what I aspired to be in the future. It’s basically given me an existential crisis because I don’t know what to do in my life at the moment and I’m only 22. 

I’ve started to detox back home and it’s early days but I’ve been currently on 4 pint cans a day now which I know isn’t amazing but I am feeling better for it. It’s insanely hard to sleep at night though and sometimes I feel very confused and disoriented at times and I feel like very disconnected. My heart rate feels strange and I sometimes feel really scared in bed at night like something’s happening to me, it’s hard to explain. I’m starting to eat again though which is good considering I could go 2-3 days without eating when I was drinking heavily. 

I think the hardest thing is that, because I’ve cut down a lot and very quickly, all these sober thoughts of regret and sadness are overwhelming me. I am aware that I have seriously messed up the early years of my life but I have to get over it. Whenever I did something bad I just laughed it off and kept on drinking. The rebound anxiety is awful. It’s like I’m having to discover what it’s like to be normal and sober because I’ve isolated myself for 4 years and have genuinely forgotten what it’s like to act normal. It’s screwing with my head a lot because the last time I was functional and sober I was 18 and I’m 22 now and it’s all so different even 4 years later. It feels like I’m living life as a different person now I’m not constantly as drunk and I’m finding it hard to adjust. I’m not even sober properly as well so I don’t know what it’s going to be like once I go fully sober. A part of me is excited to go sober but holy shit it’s hard.",6

Kids over tired and hyper today. I started with a meltdown between 1 kiddo and cousin. Lasted over an hour. We eventually left the house everyone was happy but me, I had a crazy feeling of parental incompetence.

We go for our outing then we stop at the store for supplies for our nfl afternoon. Kids are horrible in the store, running away from me and trying to leave the store and run into the parking lot. 

Everyone at the cash is staring at me and i just lose it. I started crying, this old lady is telling my kids  to listen to their mommy. I was so humiliated. 

I get home, we are all crying, i try to talk with my eldest. When i get back to the kitchen hubby is asking me to load the game, saying I'm stressed and I should have a drink. I said no twice until I blow up saying ""if i said no, it means no, cut it out"". I'm furious and overwhelmed.

Yell out that i just need a moment, leave me alone for one fucking minute

Then, i opened a rose hibiscus kombucha. It was so relieving. 

I downed the whole bottle and was so proud that even with the overwhelming emotions and everything, i didn't drink

And I'm pleasantly surprised by how relieved I felt with the kombucha. Confirms that I don't need alcohol.

2019-10-06 13:09:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/de6287/six_months_mostly_sober/,Six Months (mostly) Sober,"I am counting myself as 98% sober because of a few instances of drinking in the last six months. I don't believe that your sobriety is completely ruined if you have a drink. All those days without drinking still count. Here is my experience with mostly not drinking for six months.

I never drank a ton, but when I did drink, I didn't want the tipsy top of the world feeling to end. So I would have another drink that would inevitably turn me into a drunk-ass. I started tapering down my drinking on March 16th this year and was sober for my birthday at the end of March for the first time in years. On April 6th, I moved to a new city and used that as a way to really get sober because I didn't have a routine that involved drinking in my new town. 

The first month was surprisingly easy for me. I've tried to stop drinking before, but it was always in a place where my routine was around going to a bar or grabbing drinks with friends or something bad would happen at work and I would inevitably start drinking again. This time it felt different. I was working a new job in a new field and I was able to immerse myself in all the newness without drinking.

In my second month, I spent a week visiting friends in my home town. This town has a pretty big drinking culture where because it is called brunch means that getting drunk at 09:00 is classy and you can continue drinking for the rest of the day. I was worried about turning down a drink with a group of friends and they were really supportive about not drinking. I found out that one of my friend's partners stopped drinking about a year ago and hadn't told anyone in the friend group - when you are open about your sobriety it makes it easier for other people to be open about their drinking habits.

With summer ramping up, I anticipated the loss of sitting outside and getting buzzed, but I found that I didn't miss the gross feeling of too much sun, alcohol, and not enough water. I explored my new region, visited a few new cities, drove through the mountains, and attended one of my close friends wedding all while sober. I liked it. I could drive without wondering if I was okay to drive and didn't have to apologize for anything I said or did. June and July flew by and my sobriety continued strong.

In August, I visited the town I had moved away from earlier this year. I went to my favourite bar and saw a lot of people I hadn't seen since moving. Because my sobriety had been going so well, I decided that I could treat myself to a whiskey at the bar and wine with dinner and have it not be a big deal. I didn't have as much pleasure drinking it as I thought I would and I only treated myself to a headache. Surprisingly, I didn't feel too many effects the next morning and thought ""maybe this is okay once in a while"" despite it not living up to what I wanted.

Life continued on and I had a long, busy week at work. That Friday in September I decided to check out a bar close to the house. It was more of a joke because it looked like a place only for the locals and I thought I would walk in and then immediately go home. The environment was welcoming enough and my drinking experience the month before hadn't been so bad. I deserved to numb myself after having a busy week. I ordered a drink and of course chatting with people at the bar was very pleasant in that buzzy sort of way, so I ordered another one. By the time I leave, I am drunk for the first time since March. Nothing wretched happened while I was drunk, but I posted things online that I wish I hadn't and I stumbled around the house until I finally put myself to bed. I woke up the next morning with sweaty bed sheets and intense post-drinking anxiety. I spent all of Saturday and Sunday glued to the couch in a hangover blur. That experience is how I want to remember drinking when I am contemplating going to a bar.

It has been almost a month since the last episode and I am much more confident about my sobriety. I told my partner the other day that ""I don't drink anymore"" instead of ""I'm not drinking now"" and it felt liberating to have the finality attached to it. I don't need to experiment anymore with alcohol. It isn't for me. I am now getting my mental health in order and getting tested for ADHD and enjoying marking 0 on medical forms when it asks how much I drink now.",11

I've been a bit of a drinker for quite some time: around 15 years or so, regularly drinking around 100 units a week for a long time, at Christmas and special occasions it's worse, tbh. All day benders, then back to work the next day, driving under the influence the next morning on boxing day, sobering up whilst there. 

There's honestly no reason I decided to go sober though, except that I've been thinking about it for a while: I've seen a lot of adverts for 'sober October' lately, and kinda did it last year, (I drank about once a week, because my eldest son is a dick but let's be honest, that was just an excuse) and I've been thinking about how much better I'll feel if I stopped drinking. And honestly? I don't like drinking. I don't really like the taste, or sometimes the effects it has on me, but I've been influenced by society to think that as a man, I'm meant to come in and have a few to unwind every night. So I decided to stop, and in all honesty I probably won't bother starting again after the end of the month. 

But wow, the withdrawal. 

I had my last drink last Monday night, so I was a little hungover on Tuesday, nothing unusual just a little run down and not feeling brilliant but did fine at work. Wednesday and Thursday, no problem. 

On Friday I actually felt like I was dying. 

Lethargy, exhaustion, no motivation, I actually wanted to throw in the towel and go home from work, but my natural stubbornness kicked in and I refused. Saturday not too bad, but today I have a persistent headache and absolutely bugger all motivation. I meant to strip wallpaper from the bathroom and go for a run today, but so far I've eaten chocolate and sat on the couch, mostly playing on my playstation. 

I'm taking the dogs out soon, but that's gonna be a drag if I'm honest. 

I've not felt any of the mental side effects I've read about except for a little anxiety today, but that passed quickly and I'm just looking forward to feeling bright as a button in a week or two, full of energy and positivity. 

But until then, I'm gonna trudge along until the light at the end of the tunnel gets brighter and I can step into the sun. 

Hope you're all doing well with your own sobriety.",8

If I am drinking - it’s getting drunk and usually as quick as possible. To give the devil his due - I am really good !

This is why I cannot drink because drunk is the focus and done deliberately.  My personality demands that end goal.  

And here is an interesting tidbit, I discovered during self reflection this week.  I don’t really like the taste - wine, beer or hard liquor - yuck.  If I am in a situation where the end goal would not happen, I have always picked water or coffee over just one drink.",1

This is the longest I've gone without drinking since I was pregnant with my son nearly 9 years ago. I've made a few attempts to stop drinking in the last few years, but something feels different this time and the thought of sobriety feels a little less scary. I hope it sticks. 

A few thoughts:
I went to a concert with my hubby and a few friends on Friday night. In the past I would have gotten a hotel room and gotten so drunk that I didn't remember the show. This time, I agreed to be the DD. It was going great until everyone started to get really drunk and kept saying, ""are you having fun? You don't seem like you're having fun. So why did you quit drinking? When are you going to start drinking again?"" And one of my friends in particular kept asking me if he could buy me a drink and told me that I deserved a drink because I've given it up this long. I desperately wanted to leave but was stuck there since I was the DD. I don't think I'm quite ready for concerts/bars yet. 

I think I need to find some sober female friends. There is an al-anon in my town that has a women's group every Friday night, but the problem is that I live in a smallish town, AA is on a busy road and I don't necessarily want people to see my vehicle there.

I know I need to quit. I come from a family of alcoholics and this is how it starts, isn't it? My drinking is also the #1 reason why I'm overweight.

I’m off to work shortly, at a job I do truly enjoy, but which brings me a fair amount of stress. Physically, interpersonally, emotionally, you name 

I let the poopy mood I was in after a weirdly stressful day drive me to the beer cans last night. Never a good plan. I didn’t get shit faced drunk but I could be feeling perkier this morning, that’s for sure. I seem to have kind of found a cut off button, ha, kind of. Of course it’s cut of level keeps moving further and further away from sobriety. Only a matter of time before I go off the deep end completely. Sigh. 

I also have taken on another job, so I’m working in some fashion seven days a week. Which is rough. But, my other job allows me alone time and being around animals and physical work. So I cherish it as well. Plus, I need the money. Said other job is very hit or miss with the pay check due to its nature. This one is very consistent. 

Not to mention I’m going to be having surgery within the next month or two and will be out of work, both, for at least a month straight out and not back to full duty for another one at minimum. This is adding to my stress too. But this surgery is going to be a very good thing so, it’s worth it. 

I could have been and could be better with my finances, especially the money I’ve spend and still spend (to hopefully a lesser extent now, maybe) on booze. Which I beat myself up over. But I realize the past is the past. But the present isn’t much better :/

I know people say not to take on too much in early sobriety. Well I’m trying to get sober and be sober with a lot going on. And a lot of stress from all angles. Plus I’m still muddling through my depression and bipolar diagnoses. It has been rough as shit with that. But clearly I’m doing better. 

So now I’ve ranted a bunch, in somewhat relation to sobriety. I keep trying, I keep falling down. I guess at least I pick myself back up? I know I’m making my life harder with alcohol but I don’t know how to de-stress without it. Sad fact of the matter to be fair. Suggestions?

The last year my wife and i have worked on slowing our drinking down and have both had long bouts of sobriety. We have grown closer and i can honestly and confidently say we are as close to each other as ever. I love my wife with all my heart and soul. We have two kids who are amazing and we are great coparenters. 

If i had found this out at any other time i dont know what my reaction would have been. This sub and my sobriety has helped me with my relation to my wife and i am extremely grateful. 

My wife struggled with suicidal thoughts and says that she was in a self destructive phase. She has since started taking antidepressants and much more recently started seeing a shrink.

I do not deny that she did me wrong in the worst pissible way but i do admit that my drinking was preventing me from being the man i needed to be for her when she needed it. I also blame alcohol for her depression and suicidal thoughts. I forgive her but i have tons of healing to do. We will go to counseling together soon.

We were both a couple weeks sober when we had the discussion. We were on our way to visiting friends and i was planning on drinking and i did, she didnt. We both drank the next night together with friends again. Its my drug, i cant be trusted with the dosage though and know alcohol has to go from our lives. The drinking didnt lead to anything being said or brought up.

I love my wife so much and i know she loves me too. The thought of not having her is by far more dreadful than forgiving and growing old together. 

I posted here because alcohol sucks and keeps us from being the best versions of ourselves. I realize qlcohol is my drug and i need something else to help me cope. It ruins lives that otherwise would be wonderful. The next sober streak starts today. Iwdwyt and my thoughts and condolences to everyone that can blame alcohol for destroying human relationships.

This happens to much.,"So I joined BetterHelp yesterday morning to try and curb this thing. I had blacked out at a wedding with my fiancé and her mother. I’d been thinking of signing up for a while and this was the tipping point. I was embarrassed. Very embarrassed. I also felt compelled to take immediate action where I put money down to show my fiancé that I was serious about tackling this aspect of my personality.

The lady I matched with said forgiveness of myself is important to the process so I’ll try and get out of this overwhelming rut of shame I’ve been wallowing in by looking at a couple positives.

This whole thing used to be a lot worse in my 20’s. It wasn’t uncommon to bring a six pack or two home with me and just knock em back on a week night. Sometimes more. Weekends I’d get out with my friends and we’d go ham.

I started working out regularly as a way of curbing it with more productive habits. You can’t run or lift if you’re aching something fierce with a hangover. It’s gone pretty well, I’m running the Las Vegas marathon for my bachelor party in November. I don’t drink to excess during the workweek and I co-did two whole30’s with the better half (you eat paleo and go sober for a month).

My relationship with booze is also more healthy... most nights. I can have a glass of wine with dinner and leave it there. But every month or so... I just feel compelled to binge drink. “Getting too excited” was the little bow I put on it in my 20’s. I’m 31 now and it’s not cute anymore. I’m hoping BetterHelp gets it under control.

I don’t think I have a physical, chemical dependence. I think the occasions where I drink heavily are a coping mechanism when I’ve bottled up a lot of negative emotions and I don’t have a healthier way of dealing with them. Which is kind of scary in its own right because it means I need to get rid of my “feel better about the world and get rid of all the stress it gives you” button that booze provides. But I’m getting married in April and I got to stop this frat boy bs before I have kids.

All I do know is I don’t have the energy to face more self criticism and so I have decided today that I will report to myself and you guys here each time I do drink to be accountable and maybe monitor how I do. I don’t plan to start drinking regularly I just plan to not beat myself up unless I drink too much or in the event drinking takes over my other daily responsibilities. I plan to have more sober than drinking days and see what I can manage.

One of my main goals is to be more active, usually this stops me wanting to drink at all so let’s see. Last week I managed 2 workouts this coming week I will aim for 3.

I was scared to start drinking as a teen.  I waited til I was the legal age.  I was very much what I called ‘after school special’.  I was cautious to never make poor choices.  I kind of
Resented that about myself.   That I was a loser.   

In the last few years I’ve been seeing some trends that I’m not at all happy with.  A loss of self control.   Black outs.  Permitting behaviour that child me had vowed against.  

And my kids are seeing it.  

I LIKE beer. I LOVE wine.  I don’t want to give it up.   But I like my kids better than I do both of them.   When I think of putting them in a situation like some of the ones I went through as a child I get angry.  I would NEVER do that.  

Except I’ve been more capable of rationalizing poor behaviour.  Picking them up at school inebriated.  (I walk) Driving after having a few drinks.  Finding myself useless after day drinking when I had big plans to be productive.  

The buck stops here!  Before it’s too late.  I don’t want my kids seeing me on my last day on earth with the anger and hurt that I felt seeing my Mom on hers. 

I don’t call myself an alcoholic.  Maybe I should.  Maybe I’m not ready.   But what matters is I’m taking a stand.  For my health.  For my kids.  

My last drink was one too many at a fun night at the camper two weeks ago today.  My drink was taken away by a caring friend.  I was given water, which I could not keep down.  Threw up all over their bathroom.  I made a fool of myself.

Next thing I know, someone asked me if I was thirsty. I said ""yes!"" and they handed me a Solo cup full of beer. It was Coors Lite, the kind I used to always drink. 

(Yeah, I know, my taste in beer was not the greatest. I was always saying it was 'just for thirst, not for flavor,' when in actuality I was just using it as an excuse to drink as much as possible. Not because I was thirsty, but because I am an alcoholic.) 

Anyway, in the dream, I took a sip of this warm, flat, foamy beer, and remember thinking, ""This is not for thirst... This is going to get me drunk. OH, CRAP! I was on Day 28... Why did I ruin it?!?"" 

Because I am a mental health professional, I know better than to over-analyze dreams. Not only am I not an expert in dream analysis, but I also know that it is not the content of the dream that matters, but the feeling/emotion you experience when you wake up from the dream. So I know that the way I felt when I woke up this morning tells me that I *cannot* drink. Not only did I feel guilty, and was worried I would disappoint my closest friends and family who now know that I have stopped drinking, but the beer did not taste that good. Ugh! (I actually woke up feeling really thirsty and drank a whole bottle of water. Go figure!) 

In the dream, I could have had club soda, or iced tea, or juice... So what possessed me to have a sip of gross beer?!? I think I was worried about saying 'no' to booze in front of my friends because I used to *never* do that. I think I was nervous about telling people that I'm not drinking. That is ultimately the message of this dream. 

I am obviously still anxious about telling people I don't drink, and I'm worried about what they will think of me. Today, on Day 29, I can count on one hand the close friends and family with whom I have shared this with. In time, I hope I'm not so nervous about it, and am willing to stand up for myself and my sobriety. Because ultimately, *I* am the one who matters the most, NOT other people.

TL;DR: I am anxious about telling people I'm not drinking, so it's causing me to have anxiety-ridden dreams about relapsing. Hopefully, someone else will be able to relate to or identify with this experience. You are not alone!

Funny as I'm really a quiet/shy person.

I started drinking in 1993 and hadn't done more than 2 weeks off until now. No real rock bottom (definite addiction and problems though) but the last year or two the hangovers were becoming unbearable and unavoidable (turning into withdrawals), and at the same time my tolerance was increasing so much I found it difficult to get a positive buzz when drinking - it started to feel empty and cold. So I decided to stop and pre-empted that my brain would try to get me to drink after 1 or 2 weeks and that I should push though and ignore it. I'd ruled moderation out - as I'd tried it many times and it wasn't cutting it - if I drink, I like to get drunk.

Luckily no bad cravings beyond the first weekend, they calmed down slowly from a feeling of late night energy that I had to run off and reward with sweets and treats, and now they are just passing thoughts of drinking which have started to feel distant (even bizarrely ridiculous). Socialising around drink is still hard so I try to avoid that and am making better connections through non-drinking social events like sport/music etc.

The biggest and most unexpected thing is that the reasons for wanting to not return to alcohol have changed. When I was drinking, and even the first few weeks (of fatigue/brain fog) I couldn't imagine why people said that life was much better when sober. But around 30-40 days I started to feel a lot better, and often really damn good. I've had a few periods of illness which has kind of masked the improvements but the uptick in clarity, mood and optimism between days 80 till now is almost astonishing. It feels like a life upgrade - returning to drinking seems like it would be like chucking my computer out and returning to using Windows 98 (sorry Windows 98 fans).

At the beginning I focused on not drinking due to the terrible things it was doing to me, ignoring cravey thoughts or silly thoughts like my life might somehow be easier if I went back to it. But recently it has changed to be more about 'I want to keep feeling like this', I'm getting so much more done and feel so much better - even if I'm tired or sick it's like the base level has risen up. No more depression or anxiety, and the need to compensate in the evenings has fallen away and I'm eating much better too and exercising more. Not drinking has allowed these things, it's like a key to unlocking my full potential at 42.

Sometimes I feel moments of joy/euphoria that are better than any buzz that alcohol gave me, and it stopped giving me a buzz a long time ago. So I'm starting to think that the concise reason for stopping permanently is that I simply feel better without it and life has become it's own buzz - alcohol has become obsolete. I feel really great and thanks to all of you guys for being my sole support! IWNDWYT.",160

Many spirits were passed around, and a strange boozey smell hung around the site that mingled with the smoke that I had never noticed was there before.

Vast numbers of my previous society simply not moving for hours at a time, relishing in their non productivity, and as time drew on garnishing less and less of my interest.  It seems my time among the Sobers has given me reflection upon what it means to be active and fastened in upon a topic of discussion or manner of production.  How curious, I find myself now between two worlds...with a foot in one, and a whole Mind in the other.   

The sun is rising this fair Sunday, with the rising smells of grass and coffee, and the rising sounds of nature’s activity.  So too does my awareness and wakefulness rise, in synch with the natural rhythm.  Clear headed...this morning I make my way back to The Sobers.",16

2019-10-06 07:52:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/de28si/my_relapse_story/,My Relapse Story,"I've been meaning to share this since I got sober again 22 days ago.  I know that these stories can help others who are tempted to drink and then come here and get a reminder that drinking causes close to zero pleasure anymore and a lot of pain. 

I've been a drinker since the age of 15 (now 42).  At first, it was occasional.  Later in high school, I partied with the best of them on the weekends.  College was the same - it's easy to feel normal when there is a norm of drinking Thursday - Sunday.  I never drank in the morning to get over a hangover in those days. 

In my mid-twenties, I started martial arts, and of course found the group that loved to work out and then go for a drink, or kickbox for a few hours and then binge for the rest of the night.  We had many Saturday overnight parties at one guy's house for those 2 years.  It was a given that we'd gather there with our stash after the weekly spar.  

It was then that I met ""a true alcoholic"" (I laugh at my past self for thinking that now).  She would drink at lunch and come to class to fight slightly drunk.  She actually believed she was a better fighter drunk, because her body was loose.  

She was also a ""hair of the dog"" drinker, and that was my introduction to taking shots in the morning to kill a hangover.  At first, this was also occasional - only when I was with her with a hangover.  Later, of course, I attracted more and more friends who supported this hangover solution, and it too, became the norm on weekends.  

After a few years, I graduated to bender status.  I had friends and family members who would plan entire trips and events around drinking for days.  We would all just drink for 3 - 7 days straight, and in between drinking maybe we would ski or lay on the beach.  Or even (and this one is great) attend a spiritual past life regression workshop.  Kinda drunk.  Because I'm better at meditation when I'm ""loose"".

Anyway, after trying countless times (it must be around 1000, no kidding), to stop - I finally did in January of 2018.  I had had enough.  I KNEW I would never drink again. There was zero appeal left in it for me.  I read This Naked Mind, connected with Holly Whittaker who founded Hip Sobriety (now Tempest) and met other friends who were waking up out of the brainwashing of alcohol and getting sober as well.  

It lasted 7 months.  Those were the best 7 months of my life.  Not in an ""everything is perfect"" way, but in an ""everything is clear"" way.  I was starting to get to know myself. I didn't like all of what I saw, but for the first time, I felt empowered to do something about it.  And I did.  I worked out, I connected more deeply with myself and my friends and family.  It was great.  

Until.

I didn't see it coming, but I was having dinner with an old mentor of mine from graduate school.  She is the type of person who has one drink maybe every month or so.  She ordered a gin and tonic.  I ordered a glass of wine.  Thinking it would be ok.  Just an experiment to see if I still even liked the taste.  

The problem is, it was never about the taste.  It was about the effect.  I have never ""enjoyed"" alcohol.  

Well, my brain picked up where it left off and I drank alcoholically from August 2018 until 22 days ago.  I moved in with my SO in that time, so I wasn't drinking in the same amounts (couldn't get away with it), BUT I was hiding and lying and making excuses to stay over night anytime I went out of town to get my fix in.  I would buy a bottle of wine and take a long walk, just drinking.  

And I felt sick, depressed and anxious almost every day for more than a year.  Nothing enjoyable, not escaping anything.  zero pleasure, only pain.  And I tried stopping again countless times and could not.  Until 22 days ago.  

Again, I feel better about myself in the last 22 days than I have in over a year.  Can you see the pattern here?  Alcohol causes anxiety, depression, isolation, illness, lack of energy, negative self talk, lying, stealing (I snuck bottles of wine from a training room fridge and downed them in the bathroom on discreet ""bathroom breaks"" during a presentation by my partner), bloating, hiding, bad skin, horrible sleep, etc, etc, etc.  

IWNDWYT, and I hope that if you've been thinking about it, this will inspire you to remember your own alcohol induced pain.  

TL/DR: Drank for years, got sober for 7 months, had one glass of wine and was trapped in alcohol's miserable grip for another 11 months.",43

I don’t know if it’s because I’m an introvert and I can no longer hide behind the alcohol, but I simply have NO tolerance for idle chitchat and mingling at work related cocktail parties. I’m in management, so my absence from such events can be seen as either being too busy or not caring. Neither of which is a good look.

I’m in bed by 7:30 most nights (again, hiding?) and I keep this schedule even when I’m traveling to events where there are evening festivities. I play it off as the noble high road but deep down I know I’m not facing real life. That said, when real life is often a parade of alcohol, why waste even one minute on it?

My husband wanted to do Stoptober and I reluctantly agreed I'd at least start the month. So far so good but I honestly don't know what sober people do in their spare time. I went to bed at 8:30 last night, on a Saturday night!

I've been to church this morning. My husband always asks if I want to join him and the boys but I usually decline to stay at home and do some steady morning drinking in front of the TV before I'm once again invaded by my lovely, loud and energetic children. 

I know it's good for me. I know it's good for my family. But I really don't have many hobbies that don't revolve around alcohol. I'm even finding watching the TV dull without a drink in hand.

First day being here, I got really drunk and started a fight for no reason. I was so entitled and I felt that it’s only hard for me this whole moving abroad thing. The anxiety kicked in a lot abroad and I kinda drowned in alcohol each day. That being the only way I could get my mind to shut-up.

I thought that getting drunk is the only way I can express rage and sadness. But being drunk while expressing it just got me blind to the pain that I’m causing and to others pain and sadness. 

That night, three days ago was a mess and I don’t want to cause anymore pain to the people around me. I don’t want to have this feeling that I hate myself so much.

I think the hardest thing has been explaining to my co-workers. I work in an industry where drinking after work is the norm, not the exception. 

I've managed this a few ways. The reasons I decided to quit drinking are numerous. Health, relationships, financial, it hinders creativity, it interferes with sleep, and it just makes you smell awful when you sweat.

Instead of just outright admitting I turned into an alcoholic over the last few years ( once you get this moniker, everyone associates you with it in terms of working ), I would tell them I'm doing it for my health and seeing how much money I can save.

Also, this weekend I've had the only cravings I
I've had in the last month. My brain ( or booze goblin, as I heard one SD redditor put it ) has began telling me I deserve a 12 pack. I just got 4 days off after working non stop 12 hour shifts.

I've also had problems getting my sleep schedule back on track. It told me a few beers would help me sleep.

I almost gave in today, but I didn't. I realize life is better when I don't drink.

However, despite being surrounded by thousands of people singing my praises, I've never felt more alone. 

I'm having the complete opposite reaction to this as I expected. My social anxiety is telling me that I did everything wrong, even though rationally I know I did everything right. So many people came up to me, telling me stories about my music and how it's influenced their lives, and I hate that these interactions make me uncomfortable. It's not that I don't want to hear what they have to say, it's more like I'm hyper-focused on being the most helpful, kind and caring version of myself, that it turns me into an anxious mess. Alcohol used to dampen that panicked feeling, but now it's like I don't know how to connect with people, especially strangers, without it. 

And then I start thinking about how I feel broken, still full of anger towards my ex from so long ago. Feeling trapped in my mind, terrified of being vulnerable with someone again. Guilt for not appreciating the great things in my life, and feeling like a shitty person for focusing on ME when people reach out with their stories. And so it goes, on and on. Thoughts are spiraling and all I want to do is drink. This is the strongest the urge has been in my six months of sobriety. I just want to turn the brain OFF. I want the warm whiskey blanket.

I woke up from a dream about being fired for a set of mistakes I made this week and it unearthed a deeper reason I went back to drinking.

I was linking my drinking to my failed relationship but at the same time the relationship finally went away I was laid off from my last job.  Not fired but I felt like when a company downsizes they don't cut their best employees.

I came of age professionally in a wash of booze.  I chose jobs that I could manage and now I'm moving towards more serious territory and I am not sure I'm mentally and emotionally mature enough for that.  The booze helps to mask all of that.  It was a way to shut off the imposter syndrome and go back to the good times, like a liquid time machine.

My boss talks a lot about ""ownership"" and how important it is to take responsibility for our projects.  It feels great to succeed in that environment but feels terrible to fail.

All this to say I need a plan and I need more positive ways of dealing with stress and failure.  

So much of this modern American existence feels like a trip to the casino.  I'm up, let it ride.  I'm down, I'll play conservative and keep my fingers crossed.  Maybe I go bust.  The odds are not in my favor but blind hope keeps me thinking I can beat the odds.

I was ashamed - I couldn't remember breaking my toe. But what kind of example - what kind of life - was I giving my son? What kind of mother did I want to be? 

I decided that I wanted to be the kind of mother who would be tentative, responsible, energetic, happy. I wanted to be present. Not clouded by alcohol. Not weighed down by alcohol. I wanted to be free. I wanted to be me.

It took me five months to get to the point where I was ready. I knew I had to quit, but I didn't know when I could. I wasn't ready until I was. I needed to do it for my son, but I also needed to do it for me.

Pros: 

I had a good time playing poker with my friends

For a variety of reasons, this experience drinking has reaffirmed my desire to remain sober.

Cons:

I drank liquor from my best friend’s house, without his knowledge.

I spent many moments while not drinking, thinking about drinking more, rather than staying focused on the moment

I was paranoid the whole night about them finding out I got drunk, until I got drunk enough that I wasn’t worrying anymore.

I walked to the gas station after hanging out with everyone to get more liquor, ending up with my throwing up that night. 

I now have to tell my best friend that I stole from him, losing trust in a relationship I value highly.

I have to decide who to tell what about this experience, conflicting with my desire to live honestly in my sobriety. 

I have to reignite the worry that my loved ones have for me.

I spent an hour worrying about why my heart was pounding so bad before falling asleep.

I feel depressed and shitty today, as I did every day in my active addiction. 

\---

Some more thoughts about what I can take from this experience:

I am in a very different place than I was 6 months ago, drinking a 750 a night. Today, I can consciously, and fairly easily tune out the addictive thoughts that so easily overwhelmed me before. Also, I got to the gym today, hydrated, and am moving on from this experience, where before, one relapse meant a spiral right back into oblivion. However, Drinking yesterday puts me at a much higher relapse risk today, so I will recontinue my Antabuse therapy. 

I let the demon in the back of my brain get the better of me. I was only thinking through rose-tinted glasses. Drinking directly lead me to commit shameful actions. I have lived honestly and well this last 6 months, and one experience of drinking brought me so much closer to where I was before. I am glad this experience happened, because I was riding high and have gotten a much-deserved shot to the ego and a reminder that I am VERY MUCH still an alcoholic and I have a huge number of valuable things that I stand to lose.

However, I have honestly been scared to do it. I'm scared to have a whole new lifestyle and feel more like an outsider than I already do. But today, I am hungover and it finally clicked- what do I get out of alcohol? At best, I have a good time but I do that plenty sober. At worst, it exacerbates my depression, makes me an ugly person, and alienates me from the people I love. Why would I want something like that in my life? I don't even enjoy it - I really don't like going out anymore. So here I am...ready to give sobriety a real go.",3

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sunday Sobernauts!  So, this is my first-ever Reddit post and I'm hoping I do it correctly.  I've actually been on Reddit for a number of years, but never felt the need to post in any forum; however, I do love the daily check-in and figured it was time to step up and do my part.  

I am speaking to a dementia support group this afternoon, so I have been planning and panicking all week over the presentation and doing the check-in both on the same day.  I am not a public speaker, nor am I a motivational writer.  So my wish for us all today is a calm and peaceful day, free from regrets, from alcohol, from hangovers, from self-loathing.  Everyone here has helped me get to 488 days sober and I love you all.",80

I haven’t been very helpful around the house for weeks now. We moved to a small town two months ago. I struggle with change and depression hit me really bad and I turned to drinking to cope. The drinking worsened my depression and I felt really ashamed, which didn’t help my productivity. My husband has been feeling lonely and like he has been carrying all the burden, which is mostly true. I am having a hard time knowing how to express what I am feeling to him but I know we will figure it out.

I am slowly trying to incorporate small steps toward a healthier life. I actually did some ab and back exercises today, caught up the laundry and contemplated how to plan for the next few days.

Do that for 15 years and it's $100,800 spent on alcohol! Looking back it's embarrassing, and alarming understanding I could be in a completely different place in my life if I never started drinking almost daily years ago.

After doing the math, now that I'm doing sober October with you all, I've found how much I'm saving. Before, not only was I getting drunk, I was eating out since I didn't feel like making dinner, and then not making lunch for the next day at work, so eating out almost every meal. It all adds up.

I expect to save $800 dollars this month doing sober October, since I'm sober, making my own meals, not going out to the bars, or drinking at home. It's amazing how much I'm getting accomplished now that I'm sober for the first five days of this month. Cleaning, watching tutorials for coding, getting back to the gym, reading, etc.

This is huge wake up call, and it's true what they say. **SOBER** stands for **S**on **O**fa **B**itch **E**verything's **R**eal

I was hospitalized 3x from trying to literally drink myself to death in 2018. Debilitating depression plagued my everyday. I was drinking nonstop, trying to “self medicate”. I lost weeks at a time from taking shots (vodka) as soon as I’d wake up. I missed a few of my college exams because I was drunk and passed out. I was calling out of work a couple times each week. I was using my depression as my excuse that I had to get wasted to not feel and think. At the end of September I was finally fired (my manager had been very understanding until that point, I would have been fired months ago if I was anywhere else). 

After getting fired, I moved back to my Mom’s. I soon after stopped completely and finished the school year. I got a new job. My relationship with my boyfriend suddenly went back to how it was during the “new relationship energy phase”. He was the one who would get me to the hospital. He was doing his best to be supportive but a person can only take so much, and our relationship had been struggling. 

I’ve been the happiest this past year than I’ve ever been. I’m even being considered for a manager position! Some days I still crave a drink, but my mom and bf are always there for me if I’m struggling.

I was stuck for a long time. I started when I was 19 and didn't stop till I was 36. It got progressively worse from beer to hard liquor and multiple beers EVERY night. The blackouts toward the end of my drinking phase was the worst. No DUIs or arrests, just a lot of sad drinking sometimes at bars or alone at home. I knew it had to end as there was no way my body would be able to keep taking such punishment.

Now in hindsight, I can see that anything is possible. I'm thankful there were positive outlets like here and the books out there. Good stuff. IWNDWYT.",57

A really good friend of mine gave a birthdayparty and although I totally didn't feel like it, I felt I needed to go. I didn't see my old (drinking) friends since I got sober. 

When I got there I immediately realised these people - who have been best friends my whole life- don't fit me anymore. A painful conclusion. The music they play, their conversationtopics, their clothes: it bored me like crazy. It all seemed so fake: people who dont know what to talk about and how to act so just drink and smoke their time and insecurities away. All these insecure, searching souls who pretend everything is amazing. All these shallow conversations about nothing. I suddenly felt so strange between these people, like I'm from another planet. They sighed when I told them I didn't drink. And I wanted to be so badly the crazy party girl they knew and they loved. I wanted to show them *""Im still fun*!"" Even without booze. But I just couldnt! I was bored and just didnt feel like it. When I still drank I was probably also bored, but I just drank that away so I could still be the life of the party and give everyone the time of their life. With me it always got crazy, adventurous and exciting. But now I sat there quite silently, just wanting to go home. Not even felt like dancing or trying to have good conversations.

I dont know what to do. Letting go totally of my old friends feels to painful because I still really love them. Letting go of my old self and manners also feels weird and insecure. I dont want to be boring and silent, I want to be crazy, adventurous and exciting!

I like reading other peoples' stories, they have been a source of great strength on my sober journey.  I've been drinking since I was 18 (32 now) and have been trying to get sober for probably a little over a year.

Anyway, I've always been close with my brother, but due to developing family drama, I foresee continuing a relationship with either my brother or my GF, not both.  Today has been very rough emotionally, and a year ago I would just be finishing off the 12 pack of beer in the fridge, and making a quick run to the grocery store to stock up on another 12 and a 6 pack.  I would have tried to deal with this stress by drinking it away.  I would probably continue drinking tomorrow at 8am until I passed out.

I am very fortunate that I have finally conquered the urges to drink when the going gets tough.  I am able to realize that if I spend all day today and tomorrow drinking, my problems would still be there on Monday waiting for me to solve them.

First one I ever laid eyes or hands on, and it’s everything I thought it would be. My loving (and sometimes enabling) wife said I should get it, but I really enjoy the successes we’ve been having with improving our financial standing, and $2k is a chunk of change that would essentially bring us back to nearly square one. 

I have not agonized over a decision so much since my last drink. On that battle (the last drink), I caved. On this one, I walked away... but man, it was hard.

Technically it ended at Wendy's which I was pleased to pull into after aimlessly driving around Los Angeles on a Saturday night. 

And technically it ended *outside* of an AA meeting. On the sidewalk. Across the street. It was packed. I foolishly thought of the possibility that it would be so empty that it would be uncomfortable. But I could tell from across the street while I smoked a joint like my life depended on it... ""better than a cigarette and better than a drink"" is always my go-to defense... that the pews were already spilling into the aisles. Why's it always have to be a fucking church. 

People mulled around the dimly lit parking lot of the single-story building, all pacing, smoking whatever they had. Part of me hoped I'd go unnoticed. I'd go unnoticed wearing fishnet stockings under not-covering-much-at-all shorts and combat boots. Yeah fuckin right, ghost\_cookie. 

I *had* intended on having a night out in Hollywood, after all. With my friends. With my friends that I've always done everything with since college. With my friends that got me through cancer and my addiction. With my friends who accepted me and loved me no matter how drunk or suicidal or out of control I got. With my friends that I couldn't stand to be around for more than 5 minutes at a time. At least not on a night like this. Not when it's fueled with liquor, and live music, and memories-- three things that I can't combine anymore. It brings it all back too much. A bitter blur of guilt and escape.

The other part of me hoped that by some divine miracle that somebody would reach me. Would give me the tiniest push in the direction of that building. That someone would say the right words and have just the right demeanor. An animus of sorts to guide me through this discomfort. I am not a conversation starter. I am not a small-talker. I am not the warmest girl on the planet. I prefer my alone time and I prefer my quiet. I need it to think. Thinking is all I do. Constantly. And lately, it's been fantastic.  Except on a night like this.

He walked up to me cautious, almost like I was feral. I have no poker face to speak of. He could probably see my brain frying from all the way across the street. He was timid. Friendly. Not from Los Angeles. Not from America. He asked if I wanted to ""share."" I chuckled at the cult-like tone of the question. I gave him the bullet notes. 

* Cancer survivor
* Alcoholic
* Bi-polar
* Unapologetic ~~emotional abuser~~ ex-partner
* Being forced to see ex-partner due to being in a wedding together as well as his relationship with the rest of my friends
* Being forced to relive six years of alcohol abuse at the hand and encouragement of said ex-partner
* Concluding that I can't spend time with my friends as a group any longer
* Coping with the fact that alcohol and apologists have separated me from my loved ones
* Accepting the fact that I might be different for the rest of my life all because of fucking alcohol

""Do you want to come in?"" he asked.

""I don't think so,"" I said, lighting another joint, ""It's been over six months without a drink. I'm not relapsing now. I'd rather blow my brains out than let Ex be the reason I fuck myself over.""

He said his goodbyes and I said mine. He walked down the sidewalk and I finished my joint. I waited until he was out of sight before getting back into my car. I closed the door put the keys in the ignition and as my muscles contracted to turn the key, I choked.

I choked and I couldn't breathe. I managed a sob and the gates opened. My head rested on the steering wheel and just sobbed. I will always be different. I will always be an alcoholic. I will never have what I had with my friends again. I will never see them the same again. And they will never understand.

But I'd rather be alone than have any of my friends understand.

I don't really think I'll always be alone.

And I know that I'm harsh when I talk to people.

But at least I know that when I find myself in Hollywood on a Saturday night having to order soda water and lime from the bar because the cocktail waitress wouldn't be able to keep up with my consumption rate if I had paid her; a consumption rate exacerbated by the mere presence of someone I *shouldn't* have to see (yet here we are); I can recognize that I need to put down my ever-empty lime rine and half-melted ice cocktail, get my shit, google the nearest AA meeting, walk to my car, and go to that place. 

I may not have gone in, but at least I went.

After the wedding, I never have to see him again. I'll be counting down the days. 

Until and after then, IWNDWYT.",13

I forced the last one down (why?!).  I have periodically used alcohol for “stress relief,” and then regret it the next day as I have to recover. I can go out and have two glasses of wine with dinner and be fine. But, throughout life, there have been THOSE TIMES....those times that I drink way too much, the binging. I don’t drive drunk; I’ve never hurt anyone; I haven’t had an accident; I’m good with my job; I don’t drink on work nights. But I’m at a point where I need to stop using alcohol as a crutch anytime there is a high level of stress in my life.  My plan is to not drink for a month and see if I can gain control of this. I’m also going to start running again to relieve stress. I need a change.

Last night I got that itch to give moderation a shot. Went out with the intention of having 3 beers. 50$ and 12 hours of sleep later I awoke with a mild hangover. Turns out that moderation requires a significant force of will for me. Normal folx don't require that, do they?  So I endeavor to make this my day 1. I've been flirting with sobriety for a few months now (heyyy gurl how you livin?) and I'm now committed to giving this sober life a real chance. I'll continue to lurk and offer y'all words of encouragement as I move forward. I wrote this post as a reminder for myself. Next time the false promises of moderation wriggle into my mind I'll look back on this post.

2019-10-05 17:58:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ddty8w/small_changes_i_made_that_have_helped_me_stop/,Small Changes I Made That Have Helped Me Stop Drinking So Much,"I just stumbled upon this sub after doing a reddit search about the effects of alcohol on weight loss, but this seems to be a great community so I figured I would join because quite a few of these posts apply to me or used to apply to me.  I'm gonna include a bit of background info about myself in the paragraph below, but the main purpose of this post is to share a few things I have done that have helped decrease my urge to drink lately.  So feel free to skip the next paragraph and go straight to my strategies.  I encourage you all to share some of your own strategies as well!

I'm a 25 year old male, I enjoy drinking quite a bit, particularly craft beers.  Although I don't think I would ever say I had a drinking *problem*, I did reach a point in which drinking started to take up too much of my time and money.  For the vast majority of the last two years (possibly longer), I have probably had more days in which I had a drink than days in which I did not, and on quite a few of my drinking days I was having upward of 5 drinks.  I had gained at least 15 pounds since 2016, and probably spent wayyy too much money on alcohol.  About a month ago (26 days to be exact) I decided to make a conscious effort to cut back on my drinking and hold myself more accountable.  I have managed to go 16 of the last 26 days without drinking, and 10 of the last 12 days without drinking.   It has honestly probably been over 4 years since I went 10 out of 12 days without having a drink.  I have lost about 6 pounds since I started, and probably would have lost a few pounds more had I not backslid during the second week (after going 5/6 days without drinking during the first 6 days, I drank on 7 of the next 8 days and drank WAYYY too much during the weekend).   

1.  I stopped drinking when I was at home.
   1. This was not something I just started doing a few weeks ago.  Back in December I decided that the least I could do was not drink at the house (a habit I picked up back in college that never really went away).  That way I could at least keep my calories under control on nights when I didn't go out.  By doing this I began to associate drinking with going out, and my urge to drink at my house became damn near nonexistent.  I have made a conscious effort to stop going out so much over the last month (in order to cut back on drinking and save money) and because I had already stopped drinking at home, I did not have the urge to drink on the nights I stayed in.  
2. I made a [spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/EiFciNR) to track my progress
   1. This was just a way for me to really hold myself accountable. ""DYD"" stands for ""Did you drink?""  This might not be necessary for some people.
   2. After the week in which I backslid, I added some [rules](https://imgur.com/a/Krro5Mk) to keep that from happening again.  
3. I've decided to give myself a reward for reaching my goal.  
   1. My current goal is to go down a pants size.  I'm a bit self conscious about how my hair looks after its grown for a few weeks because my hairline is a bit crooked.   Thus, I have decided that I'm not going to cut my hair until I reach my goal.  I know this could be perceived as me punishing myself, but because I look in the mirror every day I am always reminded of my goal because my hair keeps getting longer.   I needed my motivation to be something tangible and something that I could see frequently.  
   2. I realize everybody in this sub is not cutting back on drinking to lose weight.  Many of you just want to stop drinking in order to improve your lives.  Regardless of your reasons for cutting back on drinking or abstaining completely,  I definitely think it is important to reward yourself for your progress in whatever way works for you (aside from drinking)
4. I implemented Intermittent Fasting
   1. For those who are unaware, Intermittent Fasting just means you limit your eating/drinking to a specific time period of the day.  I am currently doing a 16:8 fast, meaning I go 16 hours without consuming any calories per day and then have an 8 hour window in which I can consume calories.  I usually eat/drink between 12 pm and 8pm or 1pm and 9pm, so my eating window typically ends before I have any urge to start drinking.  
   2. This window can be modified, for a lot of people it may be easier to go 14 hours without consuming calories and then have 10 hours to eat.  That's fine!  The main idea here is that by limiting the hours in which I allow myself to consume any calories, I have found it easier to abstain from drinking.  Even on days that I do drink, I try to make sure I drink within my eating window, which stops me from having more than two or three drinks.

This may be quite obvious if you've made it through my lengthy post, but I am someone who works best when I give myself a set of rules to follow.  It just helps me stay disciplined and form better habits.  If any of you have some strategies that have helped you stopped drinking feel free to share!

I've never really considered myself to be an alcoholic until recently. Overindulging in college was just college, even when I wound up in the hospital and when I got an OWI. Having a few beers after work wasn't a big deal, it's just a few beers and I'm trying to relax.  
  
To give some backstory on this, my wife's dad was a gambling drunk. He got 3 DUIs, lost their family house, and divorced my wife's mom when she was 13. My wife has seen the worst of alcoholism firsthand.  
  
My wife has always questioned my drinking, I always said it was because of her personal experience with her Dad. I have gotten too drunk a few times when we get together with people, but it wasn't until we stopped keeping alcohol around the house that things got bad.  
  
I have started buying booze and drinking it when my wife isn't looking. Having a few drinks late on Friday night or after work won't hurt her if she doesn't know. Sometimes I feel a little hungover in the morning, but it's manageable.  
  
Then last night happened. I drank almost a full fifth of vodka, vomited on the couch, and got in a fight with my wife. I'm laying in bed typing this because I'm too hungover to do anything. Everything is out in the open now.  
  
Drinking in secret has never felt good, but now I am ashamed. How have I let myself get this far when I'm surrounded with the terrible truth of alcoholism in my family. I just hope she doesn't leave me.  
  
I am an alcoholic, but I won't let it consume me. I am going to lose my beer gut & 20 lbs, I will attend my first AA meeting tomorrow, and I will not drink another drop. If someone wants to set a RemindMe to hold me accountable, I would be really appreciative.

I want to accept the beer I’ll inevitably be offered and tailgate. I want to. I really want the drink and the tailgating experience I’m used to. It feels like stopping to grab a twelve pack and “leave it all behind” would be the ultimate moment of gloriously saying “fuck it” and the night would be awesome. But, at the same exact time, I would have to start over. I would have a hangover tomorrow. I would feel crappy at work Monday. I feel so trapped.

Made it to 6 months sober for only the second time in my entire life. Pretty pleased with myself. 

Today wasn’t the greatest. Nothing bad happened, just a bunch of little stuff made for a kind of ‘blah’ day. 

Honestly, i’ve been kind of discouraged with this round of sobriety cause the last time i was sober  for this long, which was about 4 years ago, I had basically ridden the pink cloud the entire time right up until I relapsed. (drank again cause i started seeing a girl. story of my life.) But this time that pink cloud is nowhere to be seen. It seems like every day is a struggle. Not necessarily a struggle to stay sober. I honestly think I’ve done enough experimenting to fully realize the worst day sober is better than the best day drinking/hungover. Just a struggle to do everything else to get my life together. 

Sometimes it’s hard reading other peoples posts on here about how everything is going so much better since they quit drinking (e.g. picked up a new hobby, lost weight, connecting with friends.) None if that stuff is happening for me this time. I might be experiencing mild anhedonia but by 6 months i would’ve thought i’d be over it by now. Plus i was never a daily drinker for extended periods of time, mainly just binges that lasted days and up to a week. A lot of the times i still feel ‘stuck’ in my life, which I always had hoped would go away as soon as i got sober. But that’s not really the case this time. 

But for anyone out there who feels like I do, like getting sober in a lot of ways made life more complicated and didn’t resolve nearly as many problems as they hoped it would, one thing i know for sure is that all my bad days now are INFINITELY better than a bad day drinking. It’s easy to forget how bad the anxiety/depression/self-loathing of a bad hangover can be once I’ve been sober a while, but nothing can compare to it.  

I HATED that feeling of coming to after a blackout. That first moment of awareness where the first thing to hit your consciousness, before your eyes are even open, is a sense of horrible dread, then searching your memory for what the last thing you can remember was. Trying to piece the night together hoping you didn’t too anything too embarrassing but knowing you definitely did, having to go through text messages, wondering how much money you wasted, having a horrible taste in your mouth; a terrible mix of dehydration, cigarette smoke, and junk food. Hating yourself for knowing this was exactly how it was going to end up but doing it anyways, wishing so badly you could go back in time to right before you decided to take that first drink, almost believing if you regret your decisions hard enough it could somehow magically undo them. Knowing full well that there’s no chance you’re going to exercise that day, or the next, or do anything at all except try to forget your alive. And also knowing that there is only one thing that will make all this pain go away for sure; another drink. Wrestling with yourself to either stay sober and take the withdrawal or put it off by drinking more alcohol and enjoy now but know it’s only going to be even worse when you finally do sober up. Completely withdrawing from the world because it’s too painful and embarrassing to let other people see you cause you hate yourself and what you’ve let yourself become. 

So ya, haha, hopefully didn’t get too dark there. I just want to let anyone out there who’s struggling to get a few weeks together, that maybe amazing things aren’t going to start happening right away for you. But you don’t have to feel good in order to feel better, sometimes feeling less bad can be a huge win too. I remember when i thought 6 months was impossible. But now i’m looking forward to a year. 

Really grateful for this community. It’s helped a lot. One love.",10

I thought that because I was aware of the fact that alcoholism runs in my family and that it is an issue, I’d be able to prevent myself from having a problem. I had always been aware, since I turned 21, that maybe sometimes I took it too far but my friends always drank and it became so normalized. Then I moved to Japan for a year and it became a full blown problem—all I cared about was drinking. I was hungover most days. I would have rather drank by myself in my apartment than go out and make friends or experience things. I didn’t know how to stop but I felt like nobody knew or cared. I spent all my time thinking about the fact that I had a problem and I didn’t know how to stop. I would go to a different store every day after work for booze because I was scared the clerks would judge me. The shame and embarrassment followed me everywhere. I found this subreddit and listened to This Naked Mind, but I still carried on the same way, up until I left.
I got back a couple months ago and I kept drinking when I came back, and fell into old habits with the same friends. A couple weeks ago I went out with them and ended up taking a bunch of Adderall and somehow ended up taking two pills of molly, even though I’m on antidepressants and could risk serotonin syndrome. I lost my wallet too, but luckily someone found it. I spent the next two days crying, probably because my serotonin was depleted. Nothing absolutely terrible happened but I just felt so sad and worthless and finally decided that I didn’t want to live like this.
At first every day seemed like a struggle but honestly I don’t even feel that craving for a beer when I come home anymore. I feel happier and more energetic. I feel like I can finally be the person who I want to be. I thought that by not drinking I’d be missing out on life but it was the opposite. My girlfriend has even noticed a huge difference in my attitude.
Of course I’m afraid of slipping back into things. I don’t know how I even got to that point, which means that I could get there again. I’ve distanced myself from my friends for now, because I feel like I need time to figure out who I am without alcohol. I think that I need to tell my parents too.

I thought I'd share my story and reflection after 3 weeks of sobriety. 

I started drinking socially since I was 16 and joined a fraternity after my first semester in college. The social experience of being under the influence was thrilling! Alcohol helped amplify the experience and put my social anxiety under wraps. Sure I had a few regretful nights and unbearable morning hangovers, but I saw it as part of the college experience. Up until this point, most of my drinking was done at social events. It wasn't until I turned 21 that I started drinking more casually like after class with some of my buds/roommates. I don't think it ever got out of control but it became difficult to enjoy myself when I was with friends without having at least a drink in my hand. I started dating a guy not too soon after I graduated who was also involved in Greek life and had a pretty extensive partying background. As you can imagine, the early phases of our relationship involved a lot of parties and drinking. There was a period of time when I was dealing with depression and was prescribed medication that did not mix well with alcohol. I ended up giving up on the medication because I didn't want to compromise my social life. 

I would not consider myself or my partner an alcoholic (most of my family and friends would agree), but I realized that alcohol was an integral part of my ability to have fun. I made a friend a year and a half ago who was sober. It's kind of a funny story because when my partner and I first met him and learned this about him, we both assumed that he was a recovering alcoholic. This past summer, we both saw him drinking a beer while we were at a picnic, and we were shocked. ""Are you going to be okay drinking that?"" I asked him. He looked at me with confusion, and I told to him that I thought he was in recovery. He started laughing and explained to me that he was only taking a break from alcohol. He used to be a heavy drinker but decided that he wanted to take a break after realizing how he couldn't remember the last time he had a great experience without being under the influence. This was eye opening to me. I couldn't stop thinking about how much I could relate to that statement. This was 4 or 5 months ago. 

After dealing with some rough life events and having to move unexpectedly, I realized that I was using alcohol as a vice to escape the reality that is my life at the time. I wasn't drinking alone but I would drink heavily when I was out with friends. I knew this was a slippery slope for potential alcoholism, so I finally pulled the trigger and decided to quit alcohol indefinitely. Fortunately, my partner decided to do the same. 

Although it's only been 3 weeks, the experience has been incredible. I'm really proud of myself for going out to happy hours with friends and serving alcohol at my own house warming without taking a single sip myself. The peace of mind knowing that I can wake up the morning after a social outing without a hangover is completely worth it. I've been making time to hangout with friends who are not heavy drinkers to do activities outside of happy hours and going out. It's even starting to feel silly to me that I used to plan entire events around sitting at a table paying for overpriced drinks only to feel awful later. I'm really looking forward to the days ahead, and I hope to continue contributing to this subreddit and being a part of this community.",13

Long story short, my ex of 7 years (its a weird one foot in, one foot out thing) still lives with me and I try and help her out as I can. She had an event where she had to bring a bunch of stuff she made and asked if she could use my truck for a couple days --Mind you she drives a tiny car and my truck is pretty large. I told her thats fine but just be really careful. So the other night she comes home in my truck and had obviously been drinking, not shit-housed, but I could smell it on her and could tell. I didnt say anything, which is my own fault but it really pissed me off. I suppose I just didnt want the fight. So last night she went to the event, which was basically just a boozefest, and kept telling me she was fine and would be home when they got done packing all of her stuff back up. this is at 12am, when I got home from work. 2 and a half hours go by and I called her to ask if she got lost, and she tells me shes outside of a local bar, which is right up the street from the event, sitting in my truck trying to sober up. I told her she had better not even think about driving my truck, which she insisted she wouldnt and if she needs a ride I will come get her, she declined. Even if I picked her up I would have still been pissed because either my car or truck would have been sitting in a shady parking-lot all night. Oh and I probably should mention, a guy she hooked up with in the past (before us) lives in an apartment under the bar and I heard a guy in the background say ""come back in and do another shot"" at 230am, and the bar closed at 1. So as I write this drinking coffee on my back deck, still no girl and no truck. my life is a country song.",10

I'm trying to stop drinking again. it's a bit difficult for me because i love hanging out with my friends and neighbors. for example i'm at concert festival this weekend with a few other dudes/friends. everyone is drinking, pretty much all throughout the day. i have been drinking too, but not enough to really get drunk or be hungover. i still feel a lot of anxiety when I go to bed, and I know that wouldn't happen if i was sober. 

i don't want to drink today and i'm writing this post in that spirit. i am going to try and enjoy the concert and indulge in healthier activities like a meditation session and maybe a massage. i've even heard of aa meetings popping up at these events. i know i'm going to get bored and feel a bit left out at times today and want to drink to fill the gap and bond with the homies by drinking. i don't know if i'll make it completely sober today, but part of my strategy is to message some sober friends and check back in on this post and subreddit. thanks for reading! i get a lot out of this sub and appreciate any support in advance!",3

First, when I arrived we immediately went out to dinner, and grandma is used to drinking wine with her favorite girl - but this time when the server comes around, I order soda water with lime.  “You’re not drinking?  It’s 2 for 1 happy hour!”  No Gran,  not drinking right now.  And you know what - when she asked why (which is one of my fears to have to explain to family) I just said, I’m just not drinking right now.  And we were able to leave it at that!

Then, last night we met up with an aunt and uncle of mine for dinner and drinks.  All four of them have a unified political view, which is vastly different than mine.  And as the 33 year old political black sheep of the family, and the youngest person in the group, they usually start to poke at my values and treat me like a little kid.  You know what was different this time- I didn’t drink.  So I didn’t feel as angry, I was able to stay present, and I held my boundaries without saying something I would regret in the morning.

2019-10-05 11:01:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ddobqg/tomorrow_will_be_two_weeks/,Tomorrow will be two weeks,"Hi, all. I felt like checking in with the community this morning because I've been going through the motions the past couple of days. It's hard to get out of bed and it feels like a general sadness has taken over my mind. A little background:

My relationship with alcohol is a complicated one (cue ""ha, yeah me too, buddy"" from everyone). My mother was a pretty violent alcoholic in and out of rehab, jails, prison and mental institutions my entire childhood. I cut off contact with her completely about 5 years ago when I was 25. My paternal grandfather was an alcoholic as well who murdered my father's mother in a drunken rage. He died in prison. My father never drank, but was violent towards me-- physically and verbally. I had to live with friends for a while because it got so bad. I was bullied in high school for being gay and didn't really have any friends. My maternal grandparents were very religious and not supportive. Between the ages of 7-14, I was molested off and on by a few cousins. Their parents and my mother were always messed up on drugs and alcohol so they never noticed anything. Anyway, all that is to say that I pushed through all of that in my teen years and made it to college with the idea I would stay far away from any chemical aide.

Almost immediately in college I started smoking, drinking and getting high. Always a party. Always a way to escape. I made a lot of friends (none of which I stay in contact with these days, however) and we partied hard for those four years. I look back fondly on that time, but most of it was spent under the influence of whatever chemical was available. I got my degree, moved and got a job in advertising at age 23. Well, that's an industry that supplies alcohol pretty liberally, and maybe it was the stress of the job during the day and the drinking/smoking in the evenings, but I started having panic attacks. I went clean and sober for 6 months. Figured I'd ""beaten it"", and went back to drinking and smoking. I went about 5 months before I decided I needed to kick the habit again. I have a pretty assertive, social personality, but began to notice that when I drank in excess I would say things to people that I'd regret in the morning. Also, I'd engage in risky sex that I wouldn't do sober. I didn't want to do that anymore. I wanted to be ""awake"" for my life. I made it 8 months this time and went back after I gave in to a friend convincing me that I didn't have a problem. I was about 26 by this point.

Eventually I gave up the cigarettes and moved on to vaping. After heavily researching moderation, my drinking moved to once or twice a week, but more often than not I would binge. Hard. 4am, two bottles of wine, two juul pods, and a few shots of vodka hard. Hangovers that last days. Anxiety. Heart palpitations. Restless sleep. Shame. Guilt. Still, despite fighting through these emotions Monday-Wednesday, I'd be back again on Friday.

This year has been a tough one. I went through a breakup in the spring (we'd lived together and had been together for two years. In hindsight, he was an enabler for the binging as he would binge with me. I love him, but it's for the best we aren't together). I bought a condo in downtown New Orleans (which isn't the easiest city to be sober in). I'm 30. From the outside looking in, it seems like my life is together. I'm successful, fit, sociable and fun to be around. I don't talk about my childhood that much, so most people just assume I'm well-established and sane because I give no signs that I'm not, but I'm a great pretender as many of you can probably relate. I've moved passed embarrassing myself in public after binging too much and can go out for a couple of drinks with friends or acquaintances and conduct myself well, but then I'll come back and drink and smoke/vape the way I want to into the early hours of morning, sometimes inviting a rando over for sex. Over the past couple of months I've made efforts to not drink or vape for a couple of weeks, but then I'd be back.

All of that to say, I've finally made the decision to completely go off of alcohol and vaping. I want to live my life without the help of chemical aids. I want to be present for it. I want to take my career to the next level and I know for that to happen, it's only possible if I'm clear-headed. I can't afford three or four days of anxiety, shame and guilt. I've been listening to podcasts non-stop, researching, getting up at 5am to workout from 5:30 to 7. I've been working on renovating my condo. I've been giving it my all. However, the past few days I've felt like that damn Zoloft ball in the commercial from the early 2000s. Just frowning while dragging across the floor. I've been so sad lately and I can't figure it out. I come home from work and just lay on the couch staring at the ceiling. I screamed into my pillow this morning. Do you think it's dopamine? I've read that it takes a while for the brain to reestablish what triggers dopamine. Friday/Saturday were my days to binge, so maybe the lack of traditional reward is at play? I do eat healthy, and exercise, and am fit. And I've been getting plenty of sleep lately. I recently had a doctor check-up and all bloodwork came back normal. I didn't mention this sense of sadness because it hadn't happened yet. I was only a week in at that point.

I know it'll get better and this sense of sadness will most likely pass. I just wanted to hear from others who have been through or are going through the same thing.

Also, thanks for listening. I think I needed to rant. I don't talk about my story that often. It feels good to get it off my chest.

IWNDWYT.

Edit: I do want to mention I had a therapist for about 3 years and worked on the childhood trauma. I don't believe my drinking was trying to suppress that trauma. I think it was more about easy accessibility/boredom/stress/release.",15

It is the early hours of Sunday morning here, and I was just driving home from work.

Only made it two streets from where I work before i got pulled over by the police for a Random Breath Test (RBT).  For the first time in who knows how long, I wasn't nervous about being pulled over.  As I waited for the officer to make their way to my car, I got ready... Turned the radio right down, got my licence ready to show them.

When the officer got to my car, they started with the usual spiel:

>The reason you've been pulled over tonight is so we can conduct a random breath test.  Have you had anything to drink tonight?

I felt so proud when I was confidently able to respond with:

>No sir.  I've been sober now since January 16th.

Officer:

>Congratulations on the effort.  I still need to test you though.  Can you please count to 10 \*puts breath testing machine in front of me\*.

After I counted, and passed. that was it.  They didn't want to check my licence or anything else they usually do.

So happy that I was able to breeze through that test, and not feel anxious about whether or not I was going to pass or not.",221

Just thought I'd post a list of the ways drinking is making life shittier, for more motivation, and a vision of what life would ideally look like not drinking. 

Drinking:
Feeling of failure and helplessness
Hangovers
Oncoming ill health
Making others concerned due to low mood
Skipping the responsibilities I supposedly drink to facilitate
Increased aggression as I feel I am failing and missing out
Weight gain (nothing mega but it's not good)
Buying unhealthy and non-veggie food while shopping drunk
Not making clear minded decisions about how I spend my time, hence wasting it.
Social withdrawal both on and offline. 


I want:
To plain feel better
Not to act out so much
Control over myself
To find out if I can face the responsibilities I have set myself (make it into a curiosity thing)
To stop fooling myself
Lose weight
Eat right
Be healthier
Be more socially involved on and offline
Be more positive
Have justified faith in myself
Be grateful for not drinking

I can only stare at a computer screen for so long before I feel like my eyes hurt.  I'm in my 30's and I can't live on a computer.

I’m 38, mom of two in elementary, wife, work full time out of house, been battling anxiety in my own for years. I was diagnosed with Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs) in June (think annoying heart palpitations that come every day at about the same time and peak at midnight before tapering off). My cardiologist told me I didn’t need to stop drinking (I was drinking a 16oz and 12 oz IPA about 4 nights a week). He actually said that I drank less than him (which at the time made me feel good, and now it seems like an odd comment to make). He said I could take all my stress/anxiety away, and I still might have the PVCs. Well, me being the “expert” and a one who thinks she can solve all her problems herself thought, I’ll prove him wrong and get rid of them myself. Needless to say, I thought trying to stop/cutback on drinking would be an easy solution to get rid of the PVCs, or at least rule that one out. In my quest to assist myself in cutting back my beloved IPAs (which the thought of made me very uncomfortable and sad), I stumbled into this thread, which led me to Annie Grace, and by September 1, I was doing her Alcohol Experiment. I started feeling the feelings I was numbing with the beer, but I was sleeping great and feeling better. The PVCs are lessening, but not gone. Since educating myself on your stories and experiences, I realized I needed either therapy or a Rx to try and help my anxiety/mood as my next experiment to eliminate my PVCs. So I had my first appt yesterday and was prescribed Lexapro and was referred to a therapiat. I felt such relief over admitting I couldn’t do this in my own and was emotional for the compassion the dr had for me. I was triggered to drink because I was proud of myself for taking that step. All afternoon I contemplated a beer or two that night. Then I picked up the Rx and read the literature on it and it said to avoid alcohol. I was both thrilled and disappointed at the same time! Happy because a choice had been made for me, I can’t drink for the next month at least (which I’d been contemplating doing but alcohol was trying to lure me back to being numb on the couch)! Sad because, I can’t drink for the next month at least. Triggered again to think, well I better have a beer or two as it’s my last chance for a while. Last night I took a sip of my husbands IPA, and thought that tastes good. I asked him if I could have the rest. I nursed the beer while we watched Netflix, and was super aware of what I was doing. It tasted good but I didn’t want to catch a buzz! (Not how I normally felt about drinking). I drink maybe 3 oz total over 30 minutes before I set it down and didn’t pick it back up. 

I have learned so much the last 6-8 weeks, from this thread, Annie Grace, and some podcasts! 

Just popped my first antidepressant with hopes my brain can someday return to something resembling normal. 

I will happily not drink with you all today.

I was there first with my kids and chose a booth on the bar side of the restaurant.  My first crazy thought was, can I sit on the bar side and not order a drink?  My wife met us and ordered a beer.  Asked me if Im doing the whole “not drinking thing” again and for how long.  I told her that Im tired of waking up hungover and left it at that.  Its not that she isnt supportive but doesnt think that I have a problem and I exaggerate things.  Mind you she is a drink one beer and Im good type of person.  My one beer leads to four with me picking up 1.5L bottle of wine on the way home.  

Anyway, family comes in and sits behind us.  Everyone orders cokes.  Older couple sits across from us and orders waters.  I’ve noticed it before but worth pointing out again—-I think a majority of people arent drinking even in a bar (at tables at least).  When youre drinking you think everyone is.

First and foremost was empathy and sadness. She has a Saturday job in a hairdressers, and I know how that day is going to go. We all do. She couldn’t eat the breakfast I had cooked for her, and looked very green. I felt so sad that she had done this to herself, but, clearly, I am in no position to judge, which brings me to the second emotion: guilt. We have hardly been great role models for her. Will she be posting here in a few year’s time, lamenting her parents, who both had drinking problems? The final one was relief. If I chose not to, I never have to feel that way again. I estimate I have had 4,000 hangovers in my life: some a headache that would disappear by lunchtime, but still render my morning a write-off, and others that were soul-crushing days spent vomiting and hating myself. I never want to feel that way again.

As a side-bar, I had a bit of a row with my wife over this. She has the habit of blaming her hangovers on not eating enough and she keeps pushing this message to our daughter: Oh, it’s because you didn’t eat enough in the day. No it isn’t. It is because she drank poison and too much of it makes you sick. I get really annoyed at these excuses: “I hadn’t eaten enough” or “I mixed my drinks”. Can we just call it like it is? We have got sick because we drank too much. Giving out mixed messages does nobody any favours. Now to be fair, my wife rarely gets hangovers. Although she drinks most days, it is usually moderate, but I wish she would get on message with this. Rant over! IWNDWYT",149

I can't say I don't crave it, I won't lie that the shakes and the headaches weren't awful, but I woke up feeling rested and I genuinely want to keep this going. 

I use alcohol as a crutch. I don't have to think about what I'm doing when I'm blackout drunk, I don't have to think about how scared or sad or nervous I am, but I've been out and about this past week and people seemed to like me just fine. I certainly enjoyed doing things and not waking up worrying there were parts of conversations I didn't remember, too. For the first time in a long time, it felt like my time between work was spent constructively rather than just counting down the hours.

Thank you to this sub for all the sharing that happens here. I rarely post, but seeing that other people are pushing on for a better tomorrow too has been really encouraging.

I'm so pleased - my previous attempt I managed to get to 176 days, and I was gutted that I gave it up before I got to the half-year mark I was aiming for.

Secondly, I've read a few times here about when someone lapses, the decision is often made subconsciously possibly some time in advance. I felt like that a few times on my previous attempt - as the six month target neared, I had this feeling I would inevitably start drinking again. I imagined what it would be like. I stopped reading this subreddit.

There are tools out there such as This Naked Mind which work on convincing the subconscious that drinking simply isn't a good idea.

I wonder if regularly reading this subreddit has a similar effect? There are all the good news stories, the great things that people achieve sober. Maybe the subconscious mind is thinking ""hmmmm, this sounds good maybe we could use some of that"". Equally if not more importantly, there are the stories of awful things that happen to people because of alcohol consumption. I could imagine the subconscious mind sat there, thinking about inserting a few 'wouldn't a drink be nice' thoughts into the conscious, suddenly going ""wait a minute - maybe this isn't such a great idea after all!"".

2019-10-05 04:03:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ddkcfc/5_months_no_booze_or_intoxicants/,5 Months no booze or intoxicants,"So this is the second or third longest I have stayed sober. This time was different though it wasn't caused by a major incident like the previous 2. This one was because I knew I had to stop drinking. The other two times I wanted to drink the entire time but couldn't physically or knew I shouldn't. 

Just want to note a few things I've learned over this period. Hopefully it will have some value for people here.

1) Drinking wasn't the be all and end all of my issues surrounding mental health. I thought if I stopped I would be a ""normal person"". This was not the case. I do feel a lot better physically and to an extent mentally. The main positive here is it is now far easier to deal with the issues I have because I have one cleared away now. So onwards and upwards.

2) I feel physically better and therefore I started to exercise more regularly and even competed in sport for the first time in 2years. I am actually really enjoying training now. If you aren't constantly feeling ill or hungover from booze you can make even greater positive changes in your life. This applies to any activity you want to take part in doesn't have to be physical exercise.

3) My relationship with my wife and daughter is far better now. Drunk dad on the couch isn't a great person to play with or live with. Lesson being that being drunk alot is not fun for those close to you being around. I at least am certainly far more enjoyable to be around when sober and I am sure many of you out there have noticed how awful it is to be around drunk people. Your family life and relationships can very easily enhance with sobriety.

Thought I would dump this in hopefully it is of some use. Here's to many more months like this. Now to celebrate with a can of coke.",11

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
 
---
 
**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

“I believe that there is one story in the world, and only one. . . . Humans are caught—in their lives, in their thoughts, in their hungers and ambitions, in their avarice and cruelty, and in their kindness and generosity too— in a net of good and evil. . . . There is no other story. A man, after he has brushed off the dust and chips of his life, will have left only the hard, clean questions: Was it good or was it evil? Have I done well— or ill?”

I had a near full bottle of Prozac in my medicine cabinet that a doctor prescribed to me for depression. I’d only taken one then gotten scared about what I knew about the side effects and left it there (hopefully you guys don’t go to war on each other in the comment section debating that topic, please.)

One night, when I was about 14 beers deep after I’d told myself I’d drink a little longer so I wouldn’t need to adjust to quitting while starting a new job, I thought, “I’m still down and I’m out of beer. How can I keep this going?” I took 3 caffeine pills, the equivalent of 600 mg released into my blood in seconds.

Then I found the Prozac.

I’d already hidden it a bit because I’d worried of taking it while drunk. But I found it and emptied the pills from the bottle and almost took ALL of them at once, the whole time laughing and oblivious to what was happening. 

Something in my brain must have said, “no BAD!” at the last second because instead I put the pills back in the bottle. I’d almost had my hand up to my mouth. But the next morning, I nearly shit myself because I couldn’t remember if I took any.

Sunday morning at 9, he called to tell me he'd decided he couldn't keep it and was bringing it to my house.  So, I have [a new kitten](https://imgur.com/Se4e1FM).  I have another cat and...she. is. not. happy.  And I realized, watching her (and how she's adjusting) that this is a metaphor for my getting sober (maybe not a great one, but here goes:

Me, drunk cat (DC), I'm tooling along in my  life just fine.  I've got my patterns, my routines, and my cat mom meets my every picky need.  Oh, you want Rye whiskey for Friday night? Fine.  The weekend's long, so you'd better get some tequila I can ""nurse"" for a couple of days (yeah, right). A $35 bottle of red wine on a weeknight? No problem.

Well, then my cat mom decides to bring this new kitten home...let's call it sober kitten (SK). All of a sudden, cat mom is paying a lot of attention to SK, because SK is a little scared in this new place, and feeling vulnerable.  SK's not sure what the rules are.  So mom is giving SK special food, new toys, cuddling with her and talking sweet. And me, DC?  You've never heard the sounds that are coming out of my mouth -- didn't know I could growl like that, did you? Didn't know I could hiss and claw and scream like a banshee at a 4 lb. pile of grey fur?  Well, I'm not gonna let you forget who's boss here.  It's me, DC.  Pay attention! Give me what I want! You're ruining my life with that new kitten, SK. She's getting all the goodies and all the love.

But I think SK isn't going away. At. All.  I think she has moved in *permanently*.  My growls and hissing don't do a damn bit of good because SK isn't scared of me.  She just looks at me like, ""what's your problem?""  But, and here's the weird part...she's not defensive and she never antagonizes me. It's almost like she knows if she just settles in, nice and slow, that I'll get used to her. Cat mom is interrupting my growls now and talking sweet to me.  She's trying to be friends with me, but I'm too proud.  Maybe I'll let her pet me again soon; I miss her cat mama love, but I've been way too pissed off to let it in. Well, we'll see...we'll just have to wait and see.

It simultaneously feels like it’s been a million years and just two days. Some days are harder than others. I’ve missed a few social events that I knew would be heavy drinking situations, but I definitely feel healthier, and obviously better in the mornings. I think I was so used to feeling hungover that I forgot what it felt like. I definitely noticed some low key shakiness, or a weak feeling, for a few days last week. But, I haven’t had to exercise a ton of willpower to abstain from drinking. We’ll see if that continues. 

I will not drink with you today!

I hadn’t been sober that long since i was 15.. almost 2 decades. (I was ‘highly functioning’ til the summer of 2018.) I started my first run at sobriety with an inpatient facility a year ago. I maintained thru the holidays and new year. In February, my work schedule changed dramatically and my sponsor moved 2 hours away. I got complacent. I didn’t find new meetings that fit my new schedule. I didn’t find a new sponsor. I stopped calling my friends. I stopped working a plan and decided i was going to be self reliant. On Memorial Day a relapse turned into a 4 month run that ended on the weekend of my wife’s birthday in mid September. We’ve been together 12 years and our kids are 8,6,&3. It was a wake up call... again. 
And - I’m back on the program. I’ve been sober 15 days now. New sponsor, back to meetings, over the withdrawals. Everything has been looking up and i feel much better... and then today my wife calls me and tells me that she wants to try a separation for her own peace of mind. She doesn’t trust me anymore. She feels like my sobriety needs to be something i do for myself. (I understand that and i believe that i need to do this for me). But I’ve burned all my chances with her. I talked to my sponsor and some friends and it made me feel supported.. but i feel cold and empty inside. My heart feels broken and I’m  feeling all the emotions of early sobriety bubbling up.. and i hate that my first instinct is to find something to numb the pain.  Honestly-I am scared. I’m scared to tell my kids. I’m scared to face my wife. I’m terrified to find a new place to live. I’m just trying to do the next right thing and I’m trying to have some faith that everything will work out the way it is supposed to be in the end. But damn I’m struggling right now. Called my sponsor and some other friends, but my heart hurts and i don’t like that feeling. IWNDWYT. But I’m white knuckling it at this point. Gonna try to go to bed and hope for a better tomorrow.

Unless he has a stash but I’ve got a pretty strong nose for it and he’s horrible at hiding that sort of thing so I don’t think he is. 

What I haven’t really spoken about is how unhappy I am with him, how much I think I tried to drink it away. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t love me, he loves the comfort if that makes any sense.. 

Tonight I’ve been pretty down about it and I’ve been trying to work it out, literally. According to my Fitbit, I’ve went well over 12,000 steps today. He seemed kind of distant. Since I’ve been sober, I haven’t really been initiating any intimacy because it kinda dawned on me that I was the only one doing that. It’s been days since he’s kissed me or hugged me. When he holds me at night to watch our show, it’s clumsy and not the way he used to. I haven’t said anything to him yet because I don’t know how without it sounding like an accusation. 

I had to run to the store to get a couple energy drinks for our early morning tomorrow, he asked me to get him a beer and then said “never mind I know that it’s hard for you to do that now that you’ve quit.” He was genuine and was going to go without. I wanted to be nice and get him one anyway. I walked in the store and my unhappiness hit me. Thoughts rushed at me telling me to just buy a little shot of vodka, just one wouldn’t hurt. I wanted it so bad. It was like I could already taste it and feel its warmth. 

I got his beer, the energy drinks, I left. I got into my car and sobbed. I don’t feel proud I didn’t get me anything. I don’t feel sad either. I just feel defeated. Lonely. Anyway. I needed to get that offf my chest and I don’t have anyone IRL I could tell it to. Thanks if you read it.",26

During work today I had a lot of anxiety around how this first weekend is going to go. Wife kept asking ""what do you want to do tonight?"" And I couldn't decide between going out for dinner or staying home. Both scenarios made me worry about triggers and cravings. Right as I finished work, we were invited out for Chinese with a couple of friends. I hesitated, and then said fuck it, let's go.

We had a great time! One of said friends has been in recovery for a few years (with a few restarts in between), so it was actually quite comforting to have him there. I opened up about my quitting, what kind of plan I have in place, what tools I'm using (gave this awesome sub a shoutout!), how I feel so far, etc... I felt normal, and I felt GOOD. I was a little fidgety and nervous, but stayed engaged and laughed and enjoyed a nice meal with a couple glasses of tonic and lime. 

This has put me in a much better mindset for the rest of the weekend. Bring on more challenges!

Happy sober weekend, everyone!",41

I would stand behind and try my best to go unnoticed by my bosses.

Now that I'm sober I just haven't been taking shit from anyone, including my boss. I refuse to be treated unfairly, I refuse to be talked down to disrespectfully. I just refuse to be treated like shit and its starting to become an issue. I can hold a job but I leave them everytime I start being mistreated by my employers and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of dealing with shitty bosses. I'm sick of changing jobs. I'm just sick of having a miserable work life.

Idk what the pount of this post was. I guess I'm just venting but I swear there was a moment today where I seriously considered drinking again just to keep this job.

They are a FANTASTIC distraction from drinking. Today I had to take the day off work because I hurt my back yesterday. I went to the store this and badly wanted to get a bottle of wine to drink the pain away. 


Instead I loaded up on treats for my shyest foster dog and he took one from my hand for the first time! 


Fostering gives me a reason to be sober. I have to come home and take care of my animals. I dont have time to drink. Each foster has different challenges to overcome, whether it be behavioral or medical or both. Cleaning up after them and taking care of them takes so much time and patience. They've all had such hard lives so I HAVE to be there for them every day. I cant just get drunk and ignore them like I did to my dog for so long. As a side note, my dog is much happier having other dogs around he can play with, and I dont have to worry about the responsibility/cost of adopting another pet. 


Fostering also gives me a sense of fulfillment that nothing else has. Marketing a dog and finding that perfect home for it is such a good feeling. Seeing a shy dog open up or a sick dog get healthy is so beautiful. And if the dog isnt working out with my household, no problem! I can return him/her to the shelter, there are always hundreds more dogs that need a little extra push to get adopted. 


If anyone is interested in fostering and has questions or concerns feel free to ask! I work in an animal shelter that has an amazing foster system and know it inside and out. Fostering has been instrumental in my sobriety and I'd love to share that feeling with anyone whose struggling and loves pets as much as I do!",18

 I can make it another day. But I'm sort of resentful that I can. It's easier to just relent to the urge. But it is said that resisting strengthens our resolve. Which seems to run counter to the insufficiency of willpower argument in AA. But I've learned that it doesn't serve me well to entertain those thoughts since at the end of the day, my involvement in AA makes it easier to stay sober.

This time around it's been going on a year and the longest I can get is two weeks. I am trying to figure out what is making me relapse - I realize addiction is a chemical process but I think that I see a pattern. When I have an excess amount of energy is when I head out drinking. This last time, I had a super productive day at work, I went out to play racquetball, and I was still brimming with energy so I went out for a run at 10:30 at night. It was on that run I felt very alive but also over-energized and I suddenly decided that I was going to go out and drink. Fast forward 3 days and \~ 30 drinks later, and I don't have any energy any more.

I have strategies - post here, just sit and wait, call sober support, among others. But when I decide not to use them, I don't use them. It almost feels like I can't resist the urge when it arises. I don't think it's impossible to overcome, but so far I've failed. My mind, that usually tells me I can't drink because I have a problem, will tell me that somehow this is the time I'll get it under control. And I know that isn't going to be true at a certain level, but it's a good enough lie to allow myself to get alcohol.

Anyway, what I wanted to share was a really inspiring and thought-provoking quote that showed up on my Sanvello home page today:

>If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete. -- Buddha

I often find that it is quite easy for me to give other people the benefit of the doubt, to cut them some slack because I realize that they may have painful struggles that I cannot see. But giving myself the same kind of acceptance or forgiveness is much harder. I know it's an old cliche; ""before you can love others, you must love yourself;"" but somehow this new wording is much more powerful for me. 

Maybe it is because I believe that it is one of our great obligations as human beings to be open-minded and forgiving, and to encourage others to grow. I am agnostic, but I believe that we should be motivated to make life better for others solely because it increases the happiness of the world (so there is no need for promise of reward or punishment in the afterlife). What better legacy could anyone hope for than to improve life for at least one other person, however small the difference we make? This quote reminds me that if I restrict my self-value with harsh judgments based on my past actions, my empathy is limited, and that limits the help that I can offer to others. As an extreme introvert, it is hard for me to reach out to others anyway, but I believe that if I can expand my compassion to include all people in all circumstances (even myself, an alcoholic who has made many serious mistakes in life), I will be able to do good for others, even in small, everyday interactions.",34

I've been drinking on and off for 15 years I'm 35 now and it has escalated. I'm not an asshole I've never missed work and I'm in a relationship with a girl i live with who doesn't even know what's going on. I've always been a heavy drinker when I drink but for the last maybe two years as soon as I'm home alone I go totally nuts i mean like 6 to 8 tall boys and a half a pack of smokes and if its 9am when I'm home alone that's when I start. I don't do much like I start drinking and I watch YouTube videos and listen to music and play video gamee. I can not enjoy these things withoitbdrinking. 

I don't even smoke when I'm not drinking but like I wait for my girlfriend to leave and when I'm sure she hasn't forgot her keys or whatever I buy cigarettes a 6 pack or a bottle and coke and I party by myself. If she comes home at night I've slept it off. This has been going on for months in the relationship and I dont ever get caught because I'm good at it

I don't know exactly when this started but since it has I've probably gained 40 pounds despite that when I'm not drinking I bike or walk everywhere and I play hockey. That's how often or how much alcohol I've had in the last few years. 

Everything is boring without it. When I'm not alone I don't smoke and I drink orange juice or coffee and I eat well but I'm always thinking about the next time I can get alone and go crazy.

I hate the way I feel and look. I can feel myself dying inside. I can not stop. At the end of every binge I log on to reddit when I'm about to sleep and laugh at memes and read about things I like. Today I'm posting this. Need support.",11

I am hoping to get some words of wisdom and encouragement, if possible. I am 3 years and 9 months sober. I can't believe it! I've been slowly getting my life together. I got a new job, got my driver's license (only started learning to drive shortly after rehab), and have been losing weight. I was so happy. The cloud was less grey, and sunshine was shining down with *hope*.

Then, all my past transgressions shot back at me. My student loans that I had defaulted on nearly a decade ago, some other horrible interest loans from my binge drinking have come to bite my in the ass via wage garnishment. *I feel like, what's the point?* 

I don't want to drink. I do miss the ""checking out"" aspect of it. I won't have enough money to pay my phone bill, nor will I have enough to pay for my commute. I so wanted to take my partner on a date, but I can't, and that just makes me feel so worthless. Disappointing her again (last week I had stomach flu, so date night was moved to today) is the worst feeling. 

I stopped drinking to better my life, and it was great for a while. But my next paycheck will be all gone to these garnishments, and I don't know how rent will fare out.

I've gone through a lot of expected ups and downs in this process, but this week has been especially hard.  My brain feels off.  I can't consentrate on anything and there's a general feeling of just sadness. 

My kids were struggling with listening yesterday and I was being very overly sensitive to it.  I got so worked up in my head that I eventually just put my head down in my hands and just sat there quietly sobbing, which in turn made them cry..so we all three just sat there crying because life was difficult in the moment and I couldn't handle it.

I am flying out of town tomorrow for a relative's birthday party.  It's just a one-day trip.  Airports and flying in general was a big trigger for me before and I know full well that I could get blasted (or even just tell myself I'd only have a few) without anyone finding out about it.  The only victim would be me, is what I would tell myself.  I will be alone in my hotel room that night and everyone at the party will be drinking.  I could finally get the release I've been wanting so badly.

But, thankfully I've gone through this exercise before and I know how it would end.  Not only does it make me sad that I didn't care I was the ""victim"" before and so it didn't matter, but now I know that I would carry my disappointment and shame home with me and it would effect the ones I love, too.  Not to mention, I already know it wouldn't be a good time.

I'm so thankful I've come that far in my thinking.  I don't feel the urge to drink even though I feel like I am floundering.  I know that because I won't drink, I have the ability to make good choices to help me fix whatever problem I'm having.  It's hard.  It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done.  

I'm happy I am going to give myself time to get through this rough patch instead of drinking my way through it and having it never really go away.  It's time to take a different approach.  IWNDWYT!",1

Many times I wished that I wasn’t so damn thirsty for alcohol. I knew it wasn’t good for me but I was so thirsty that I rode over it easily. I lost jobs, relationships and friendships over it but I always saw it as intrinsic to who I was. Recently though it changed. I realised that I had a certain amount of time to do stuff and that every time I got drunk I was unable to do what I had planned. I’d realised that before, but I couldn’t control the thirst. This time though I feel like it’s different. I stopped drinking by myself. I mean I was drinking alone  for 20 years plus.

Now when I have a friend in town and I know I’m going to have to drink I see it as a pain in the arse and I prepare accordingly. I don’t actually like being drunk. It makes me slow and stupid and aggressive. I knew that before though.

I’ve kind of racked my brains about it trying to think about what’s different this time and I’ve come to the conclusion that it is this sub. Lurking here and reading everyone’s stories made me realise the weight of what I, and you guys are dealing with.

Maybe I’ll fuck up tomorrow and blow my job and my friendships over booze.

Thanks to everyone who posts here for your inspiration. I lurked for a long time both before and after my last drink. It is so important that people know they are not alone.

But I would not have even had a chance at that new job if not for getting sober. I am doubling down on my commitment to abstain from alcohol— one day at a time. IWNDWYT.",18

I have the last day I used alcohol in a negative way, which was July 11, 2018, and the last time I used alcohol at all, which was just a small glass of wine with dinner.

The last time I used alcohol at all was 180 days ago, so I just made it 180 days or half a year without drinking. 

I'm super proud of myself for this, but I kind of feel like I'm cheating because I'm currently pregnant.  I am due in May and then plan to continue my sobriety while nursing, but I feel like I'm cheating because I can't drink at this time, so I'm kind of forced to be sober.  I'm grateful to be sober and feeling great, but feel silly still calculating that sober date.

In talking to other friends about this, they have reminded me that, unfortunately, many people are unable to choose sobriety during pregnancy or other times when they are supposed to refrain from drinking (probation is a good example).  It's just hard to understand I'm not cheating...",6

I’m on the morning of day 8 and woke up with what I I think is a cortisol rush. Strong anxiety that’s not life related. It woke me up and some tingling in my fingers that’s now mostly worn off. 
I’ve had this before when I’ve stopped but when I’ve stopped drinking before I’ve also always gone Keto as that lifestyle helps me stay stable with carb cravings. 
I’ve always put the cortisol rush and tingling down to keto and now I’m no longer in denial about my relationship to alcohol I’m wondering if it’s something to do with that? 
I know there can be nerve damage but this only happened today, the tingling. I’ll go to the doctors if I need to but does anyone else get woken up with that kids of rush?

I threw it all away by getting drunk on my day off, despite doing everything I thought I was supposed to do that day.  Called my sponsor, went to a meeting, talked to people, called someone on the phone while in front of a tavern...  left the tavern...  still picked up on my way home and drank that night.  Felt shitty about it, and didn’t even enjoy my night.  

I let my wife down, and other people down, and I let myself down.  

I decided I was having a relapse and I would jump back on the wagon the next day, October 1st.

On my new day 3, I again made the decision to drink today, long before I picked up.  I brought home 12 16oz beers (drank two on the way home).  

The funny thing is, as I was working on my 3rd outside, my wife woke up and tossed the rest of my stash.  

I was dumbstruck and angry.  I couldn’t believe she did it, but I also wasn’t surprised somehow.  Because she knew I’d been through 19 days, which is a world record for me.  I looked around for where she may have “hid” it or put out of sight.  Of course, it was nowhere, and I guess she took it down the street to the trash.  All the while, I was being hit with a “holy shit” moment and thinking about how much my addiction was fighting my own conscience.

I thought it was funny that the wine was still there on the wine rack, and she didn’t think about that.  Of course, being already buzzed I opened the wine.  The thing is, I hate wine!  I’m a beer and liquor drinker and a drunk!  

I had a generous glass, trying to get back to my state of mind, but it was different.  The wine felt different and was harder to sip fast like I like to sip beer.  It started to give me a stomach ache and it was just gross to me.  

I re-corked the wine and said fuck it, I need to eat.  Crazy Alchie brain took over again and I pour another tiny glass.  Still hated it.  Hated myself.  Hated this addiction... remembered how far I’ve come.  

Made myself a sandwich and ate it, and now drinking water and vaping nicotine (my last refuge).  I hope I’m not breaking rules here, but I’m feeling pretty sober now after all that and really reflecting on so many things.  I’m trying to use this as a learning experience and a huge wake up call to get back on track. Also, been checking my ego big time.  It almost feels shattered.",7

I learned about a part of me that I didn't know existed, and maybe have been avoiding dealing with for so long... Even in my sobriety. 
I'm still so ashamed of myself 4 weeks down the line that I have the hardest time staying sober. Since then, I have had 5 nights where I have had some drinks to calm my nerves. Tonight is included.
I'm still fighting. I'm still seeking for the answers to how to deal with the parts of myself that I despise so deeply. 
This community is a integral part to me understanding my vulnerability in this battle, and I truly want to say a major thank you to everyone who has been so damn supportive, positive, and REAL with me in my personal journey in becoming a healthier, and honest human being. 
I also want to say just how inspiring it is to read all of the positive and wonderful things this community has been capable of saying/commenting on other people's journey to sobriety.

Another alcoholic tells me that alcohol is the drug of apathy. It’s this way to push away all of those feelings I get at night. The depression and boredom, the anxiety of trying to fall asleep, the fear of staring at the ceiling and waiting for the shoe to drop: immense loneliness. In my own home, with a wife that I love and the greatest child I could ever imagine, I feel lost and alone. Alcohol didn’t fix that, and now those feelings are hitting yet again. The anxiety on not being able to fall asleep. I just want morning to come.

I didn’t drink to be drunk. I drank to pass out. I drank because the morning is hours away and I want the night to end. The cruelest joke is that I hid my drinking (not well, my wife knew just about every time), which meant I had to stay up later to drink. I waited until everyone was in bed, then gulped down booze and waited for it to kick in. I spent years trying to measure out the right amount and time it so that I could have that perfect point of making it upstairs to our bed before passing out and hopefully not wake up drunk 3 hours later, having to pee. 

I was rarely successful. The whole ordeal has murdered sleep for my wife. Hopefully, trust will come back with time. I try not to resent her when she doubts my intentions to stay sober again. It’s so incredibly frustrating and alienating to not have someone in your corner, believing in you. I created that distrust, and I own that. Owning it doesn’t make it any less lonely here.

I know these posts can cause alarm some times. I’m not suicidal, just lonely. I lost my Uncle/best friend to alcohol-related suicide. It destroyed my family quite literally. This was years before I met my wife. We’re driving to my home town this weekend to do our annual Out of the Darkness walk in memory of him. She complained about having to go and I’ve never felt so disconnected from everything/ her. I need to stop now and try to sleep. I don’t think I’ll be able to.

Hungry? Angry? Lonely? Tired? Thirsty?

Almost inevitably it's one of those that is tickling ""the urge"" and so I turn my immediate attention to solving that immediate problem.

It wasn't like that at first.  I envy folks who post here that they stop and right away are rewarded with a healthy weight loss.  For me, stopping drinking made me gain weight, as I'd freely swap eating ice cream and other sweet treats for strong booze cravings for the first several months.  ""Dulce de Leche"" anyone?  Hot fudge sundae?

I don't need to do that now, and can finally use ""myfitnesspal"" to monitor what I'm eating and my calorie intake and track my fitness activity and focus on getting down to a more fit body and healthier weight.

As far as my mental outlook goes, some days I still feel ""black.""  But if I'm honest I felt like that \*far more often\* when I was drinking.

Honestly, it was my first time hearing about the whole thing. My significant other overheard the conversation and said I bet you can’t do it. That’s all I needed to hear and my competitive nature kicked in. Then and there I made it my mission to prove him wrong. There was also a part of me that was starting to recognize my drinking as pretty heavy and I told myself if I could do sober October I for sure was not an alcoholic and I didn’t have a problem it was just my age and having fun in where I was at in life... Essentially, I wanted to prove to my SO and myself I wasn’t an alcoholic. 

My friend ended up falling off the wagon within a week or two (she’s a normie) and I was the only one of my friends to make it the full month. The last night I hosted our big Halloween party and proceeded to celebrate my accomplishment by getting hammered. It was back on and I proceeded to go on a 7 day bender. After that I “pulled it back” to “functional” levels until January when I started my decline. A decline that led to my version of “rock bottom” on February 6th. I finally was ready to accept I had a problem and I wanted to get sober. Found AA meetings did my 90 in 90 which I expected to go back to drinking after but here I am...  I have my eye on eight months coming up. I still haven’t admitted to myself this is forever but I am okay with one day at a time and if that turns into forever than I’m okay with that. 

Last thing... for those doing sober October like I did last year. Just know after a month of not drinking you feel great and it only gets better from there.

I discovered his drinking habits a few month after we got together.
We live together.
He usually would finish work and have a beer in his car then 2-3 or more when he gets back home by himself in the garage. He only drinks big strong cheap cans. Sometimes he finishes them and just go buy some more, and skip the dinner.
I tried different things to help get him off, proposing activities when he finishes work, suggesting to work out or just go to a restaurant. I told him that his drinking is stressing me out and making me worry, that I would prefer to spend time with him and that I have trouble dealing with his attitude when he drinks. He promised me many times to stop and broke the promess few days after, often as soon as something bad happens at work. 
I love him but his drinking is making me overthink a lot, some days I can't focus at work because he got shit face the day before and broke a promess once more. I m loosing trust. 
When Friday hits he would have drink at work come back home drink more and make up excuses to go to the cbd hit bars and get drunk because he wants to be ""social"". He doesn't want to see a doctor or take medication because they make him different. He is from nature quite an anxious person and loses anxiety when he drinks.

I’m going to try and abbreviate it as much as possible. I know it might be a long read, I just have to get it off my chest.

Last November, my wife at the time and decided to file for divorce amicably. I had a drinking problem, and we had been separated for years, so it just seemed like it was time.

Fast forward to New Years Eve. A girl I knew was showing interest and that excited me. I invited her out to a party, we kissed at midnight, and the next 9 months were great!

She was also an alcoholic and we drank together 95% of the time and the other 5% we were just waiting to. It was great, we were in love, and I felt like I was getting my shit together (in my own drunken way)

The last three months of the relationship I told her that I wasn’t interested in the relationship anymore and that I just can’t see a future, and for me, that was a deal breaker. I told her that we jumped into all of this way too fast and I was just now catching up. She told me that I wouldn’t find anyone to put up with my drinking and my selfishness, and she was right, I was a mess. Either way, I still ended it, on a Thursday night. 

Friday morning I awoke to a novel of a text. It was mostly the normal stuff you’d expect to hear until I reached the part where she accused me of slapping her in the face the prior Tuesday night. 

This dropped my jaw to the floor. I panicked and my anxiety shit through the roof. I clawed through my memory of Tuesday and I remembered everything. We had drank, like normal, but I remember the night because it was a pretty decent night. I did my fantasy football league draft, which she helped me with. We drank knock off white claws from Aldi’s. We played stardew valley and ended the night watching YouTube like we always do. 

Of course I argued the fact and she swore up and down that I had did it, and it was an accident, but it was hard. I don’t remember this at all. She never brought it up the next day, or the following. She also was posting selfies daily like she normally did.  I was dumbfounded and scared. I questioned myself over and over. I’m a Marine, with combat experience, and I know how all of this goes hand in hand. 

We agreed to disagree in a bit so friendly way, and I thought that was the last of it. I thought. 

A week later she starts a shame campaign against me on Twitter. This girl is your typical girl who posts half naked pictures on her social media, so she has half of the town following her. So the backlash against me is almost immediate. She had posted a huge tumblr post. This post now says I hit her multiple times and outlines how much of a monster I am. I was crushed to see friends joining this pitchfork gang.

I immediately called my ex wife and asked if I ever came close to being violent. My ex wife had seen me at my drunken worst. She said no, and that she had read the post and was also blown away. She said I should put my side of the story out there before it gets out of hand. So I did, and it didn’t help. 

The shame campaign continued, she filed a police report, and I continued to break over these now, false accusations. I knew by the way she described it that this was a backlash to keep me from becoming a police officer (she knew I was trying).

I contacted a lawyer, he said that no charges will
Be pressed and to just move forward. 

I feel like I can’t even go out in my hometown. I feel like I can’t even show my face at work. I’m fucking broken. 

The scariest feeling is being accused of something  while you were supposedly drunk, and not being sure if it’s true or not. I can’t ever let someone have that power over me again. Please be careful.

I have since stopped drinking, I’m not sure for how long, but IWNDWYT.

That is until yesterday. Relatively, things are still great however I had one last consequence from my drinking days that I had to deal with yesterday. Didn't go great, but as many of us have learned there are still consequences from past us that we still have to live with. 

But I am struggling. Since quitting my emotions have been much stronger which is obvious to anyone that's numbed for years or decades and suddenly stopped. But the depression that had gone away is back, and it's borderline overwhelming. Yesterday I could barely drive, all my messages were full of typos, my brain was just not functioning and it's not better today. I've experienced this in the past from depressive episodes.. And idk. Just needed to vent somewhere, or tips to get the mind right quicker. I know it'll happen in sure time but I have too many (good!) things going on to not be able to think straight.

Did go on a run earlier which helped me be semi functional, but still running at about 30 percent.

Two years ago I was posting on this sub asking for help to get past the 4-5 day mark. I had been trying over and over for a long time and just wasn't able to do it.

The scary thing about that period was that the more I tried to stop, the worse it seemed to get. Every time I gave in and drank again, I'd end up drinking even more than I had before. Eventually it got so bad that I decided to go to an AA meeting.

That was the tail end of about 15 years of being dependent on alcohol and using it to manage my stress, anxiety, happiness... pretty much every feeling I had!

I am very grateful to have been sober now for almost 550 days. Some of the changes in my life have been huge. My daily routine looks literally nothing like what it was. I wake up early and meditate, track my budget and talk to people on here, and then go out to breakfast and read a book — and still manage to make it to work on time. In the evenings I go swimming or to meetings.

I have also learned more about myself than I ever knew and started to face some of the demons I used to hide from. It's not always easy, but it's definitely worth it. I heard someone describe what it's like the other day, and they said it was a process of ""learning to become friends with yourself"". For me, that seems to be the next big journey now that I've stopped drinking.

Some of the things that have helped me along the way are the book This Naked Mind, AA and talking to people on this sub. I still get on here every day to talk to people every time I need a little ""time out"" from life for a few minutes. It's definitely one of my tools for staying sober.

Thank you everyone for being here and I hope you have a great day!",145

I desperately wanted that pink cloud feeling again and to feel as good as my fellow SD folks. So I’m back on the wagon, 3 weeks sober. 

The problem is I’ve been feeling really down and lonely and my depression has been bad. I’ve been doing all the things that help with these bad feelings and help me stay sober: I go to therapy, I do yoga, take walks with neighbors’ dogs, walk in my local parks, and even started meditating. And despite all of this I still want a drink SO. F***ING. BADLY. 

I’ve been single and back doing the tinder thing a few months and it’s not going incredibly well. Just not consistently communicating with the men I meet on there. Which makes me feel like they’re not that into me and my self-worth goes down the drain. 

So I’ve identified the trigger. It’s because I’m lonely and sad. But how do I keep myself from drinking?

I’m heading to therapy shortly, I’m sure she’ll have something helpful to say. But I could use some advice or encouraging words. I’ll check back after my session.

But if we were all where we wanted to be already, we would have no where to go. Where you want to be will always be a moving target, so breathe a sigh of relief today and know that having aimed at that target alone is a monumental achievement. 

If you’re sober, allow yourself to feel the sense of accomplishment, however far you’ve come; whether you’ve gone a day, or near a lifetime, it’s no trivial thing to be where you’re at. Try to feel that a bit today. Give yourself some credit. Cut yourself some slack. It might just be the inspiration you need for another day free from the toxicity that was once your life. You’re doing something significant, meaningful and difficult; that’s a beautiful thing even though it may not always feel like it. 

If you’re not sober right now, and I know there’s a lot of you who follow this sub that this applies to, go easy on yourself too. Maybe you’re like me, and you feel as though you’ve “thrown away” a significant amount of sober time (I was about 3 years), but the fact is, there was more than likely real work done during your sober time that can’t be undone. Maybe you’re just playing with the idea of getting sober. Maybe you’ve never been sober, but have always known you should be. Whatever the case may be, know that the simple act of reading posts like this means you’re actively trying to improve your situation. This shit’s hard, but don’t let it take your life away because of how you feel about yourself or your situation. Where you stand is in exactly the right place to launch yourself on a new trajectory.

I didn't attend AA or anything like that, it was more of a conscious decision to better myself as a human... to stop waking up with a hangover every day, to end the blackout drunk nights where i remember next to nothing, to move forward in a new light of being clean and serene :P

Well that's me these days, took me a while to get to such a stage although probably the best decision I ever made. If anyone is ever struggling out there, chin up and keep going... sobriety will give you the best highs you'll ever have, and the best thing is that all you ever have to do is simply be a decent human (and stay off the booze and other drugs).

I can't give you any advice, although I congratulate you on your decision to stop drinking :)

My title is a lie, it does get easier. Way easier. But the second you start getting those Intense or almost Righteous types of feelings, the cravings start to come back even from so long ago. Love. Fear. Shame. Pride....4 sides of the same coin, really. Something has to have power over you to make you feel any of those things and that's why we always remember the first step to recovery, admitting you are POWERLESS to something. No one is infallible. No one is bulletproof. To take from one of my favorite movies Dogma, ""GOD is infallible, if he were to be proved wrong it would unmake the world.""  


Now I don't know about any of you in this room or in rooms like this around the globe, but I realize that I am not this thing called GOD. G-O-D, whatever those three letters mean to you is fine by me as long as they represent something that is greater than one person, larger than yourself, more wise than your own years. That's why we believe in one alcoholic helping another, being there for each other in times of CHANGE. Change doesn't have to be negative, it's just different. Some of you reading this probably have one or more of those coins we seem to cling to that has a butterfly on it. In my muggle job, corporate IT for 10+ years, we say users hate change because they don't want to learn new things. For a long time I didn't want to learn anything, except how to make my feelings go away or intensify seemingly on a whim with some sort of concoction or chemical. So I did what my mother did. I drank. And it worked, for a long time. Then I had that wake up moment. Not the ""oh I should cut down my drinking""....it wasn't until about my first year completely free of alcohol in my system that I finally woke up feeling alive again. No hangover. That was a new feeling. I had so much energy that I didn't know what to do with myself. So I went to a work meeting, and another meeting after that, and another one until the words I kept hearing in these rooms over and over again finally started to make sense. I had been in the rooms before but I was always focused on myself, not on the people around me. This was something different. Something was guiding me to those rooms because they gave me what I needed at the time.  


That's why I still go to meetings today, for work and other functions, but mainly to be around people and get those positive feelings back. Feeling needed, feeling wanted, feeling...worth something. Someone said the most dangerous thing in the world is a person with nothing left to lose or live for. That was me when I drank. The positive feelings would quickly be overridden by negative ones. Shame over how much I was spending on my disease, guilt over what I said to my now ex-wife when I was drinking the night before. I call it my ""fuck it"" moment. To me that means, if I'm already screwed meaning plastered or high or whatever...if things cant possibly get any worse, I might as well take more risks. That risk may be driving drunk one too many times or fighting with a girlfriend one too many times or possibly even being too PROUD to admit to myself and someone else that I was WRONG about ANYTHING. I felt invincible when I was drinking. The day I realized that is now my sober birthday, October 1st. Sober October. Every year.

I don't know for sure what my badge says, I stopped counting the days long ago. Take care of the months, the days take care of themselves most of the time. But sometimes, you need to go just 5 minutes without drinking and the urge passes. Other times, the urge persists longer. But if you live in the present and take life one minute, one hour, one day at a time...eventually the days turn into months and then years. I've been sober over 10 years, but have I had a drink in the past 10 years? Absolutely. But never willingly. I was powerless over those urges until I got enough tools in my toolbox (or numbers in my phone) to know that whatever came up...I didnt have to drink to get through that day.  


And that's where I am now. This October and the month leading up to it have brought on some of the most challenging things I have ever faced in my life, seemingly all at once. I'm going through a second divorce with a very vengeful and not at all sober person. I still love her, and part of me always will, but I realized she needed to be healthy before we could be healthy and happy together. So I started back out onto the dating scene (waaay too early I know, but it was either go talk to people or start using again) and what I relearned is that a lot of people out there really like me just for being me. I'm not the best at anything. I don't know everything about anything. But I'm ""pretty good"" at most things I've tried, and I know a lot about a large variety of different topics. I've been told I should have been a lobbyist, or a lawyer, or a con artist or a cult leader...and then I found my true calling. I am a Showman. I show up, whatever that means, every single day. In work, in personal life and in every room in between I show up sober and deal with whatever is on deck for that day. My ex-wife the Chef used to say ""deal with your lead ticket, everything else can wait""...in IT we have the opposite saying, ""If everything is high priority, then nothing is high priority"".....when nothing but drowning my feelings in a bottle was my number one priority, my life was definitely a lot harder. Sure, I managed for awhile but I was never truly...sober or happy.  


And that's why I'm showing up here on stopdrinking again for a bit, I tend to around this time of year with birthday month being on my mind. I am always open to sharing and obviously love to talk...but with you people here, every person reading stopdrinking for whatever reason....none of you can tell me to shut up or move along. I can drone on and on about...everything and get it all out in a postive healthy way without having another person around. Whether that person is my sponsor, one of my sponsees, one of my two ex wives or the brand new girlfriend that I'm currently ""on a break"" with. So yeah, I do kind of want to drink today and I ve taken the week off work to deal with personal life and my upcoming divorce proceedings (court dates and whatnot, right?) so getting loaded and forgetting about everything for an afternoon is tempting. Very tempting. I would not say that I am completely sober right now, emotionally I'm still a mess and will be for awhile. And honestly, I could really use a hug even from a complete stranger. But in my area there are no meetings today, at least not for awhile....so I came here. To one of my original home groups. My own personal Group of Drunks. I came to this sub reddit and spilled my heart out to my own personal GOD....and I feel, better? Lifted? I'm crying but I can't tell if it's because I'm happy that I had the strength to say no to the bottle so far today or I'm crying because there's no one to share that victory with in person right now.   


Obviously today is a first step type of day for me but I've had so many first step meetings already that I \*feel\* like I know what some of the comment responses are going to be. That's the thing about these rooms. You don't always go for what's expected. You have to come because you're open to what might be there.

I work in PR, and organized a two day media trip for NY based journalists. We had not one but two booze companies come on site and make cocktails (before I stopped drinking, I absolutely loved creative cocktails). Also, booze has always been a crutch to deal with anxiety/ social anxiety at events.   


Not only was avoiding copious amounts of free booze that I know I would have enjoyed (and likely too much), but getting over the mental hurdle of getting through the event booze free was a challenge. On the flip side it felt great! I stayed true to my goal, felt sharp, and it wasn't a negative that I didn't drink. When we went out to eat as a group everybody ordered beers, wines, cocktails, and I ordered a hot cider. Ironically every body was jealous of my drink! If I can make it through that, I can make it through any thing.   


Other noticeable things having not drunk for two weeks.   


\- My finances are so much less stressful, I actually feel like I have money again! Looking forward to start using that money saved more strategically. 

\- Feeling much sharper and motivated at work. 

\- Don't feel as depressed (that feeling of ""I don't feel like doing anything today"" is going away)",8

I've been lurking here for a while, mostly visiting in the mornings when I'm hungover and feeling awful about myself, and promising myself that this hangover is my last one. I get super motivated and start planning a sober evening, but as the day goes on and the hangover recedes, I start thinking about getting off of work and how maybe one drink actually sounds pretty nice. 

I mean, I had a rough day at work trying to deal with all of my responsibilities here as well as managing my hangover. Making sure that I don't come across like I actually got wasted last night on a Sunday or a Monday or a Tuesday or a Wednesday or a Thursday. Of course, I drink on Fridays and Saturdays, too, but I don't work on weekends. Those I've been spending taking a shot and pouring a strong drink when my wife leaves the house for work. 

I'm getting really tired of this cycle. I'm tired all the time, my gut is a mess, my heart is beating out of my chest at the lightest physical effort. I hate waking up sweaty and driving to work in a haze. I hate thinking that maybe it's not quite a full hangover but that I'm still feeling the booze from the night before. I hate being nervous that maybe people at work can smell it on me. And on my weekends I hate that I waste it away with filling my body with calories as empty as they make my bank account. 

My memory is terrible in general, and I hate that I can't remember the little details of what my wife and I talked about the night before. Thankfully I'm a happy and kind drunk so I know that I don't say anything inappropriate or mean to her, but I feel like I'm being disrespectful to her just the same.  She deserves a husband that's present and coherent, not a drunk.  

So what do you tell yourself when you're getting off of work? What's your trick to saying no to just a little drink to help yourself wind down from the day?",6

I discussed with friends and my therapist and they supported this. 

Now that I’m working the steps in AA I’ve had to face that one sip and reconcile my conception of my count with AA’s more stringent rules. 

I told my sponsor about the slip and she suggested I pick a day in February. My new day is February 13th. 

I’m sad that I’ve lost over a hundred days because of one poor choice, but nothing has really changed. I’m still feeling like a piece of shit though and I’m having a hard time parsing out my feelings on the issue. 

I have trouble with authority and the AA authority, in my mind, is discounting my progress. 

I sincerely would like to work the steps and try this program to develop my sober self and toolkit. I guess part of that is being transparent, and surrendering. 

I requested a badge change as well.

She's ignorant to the fact that I'm a recovering alcoholic, and ignorance is forgivable, but I definitely did not find that funny. AA saves lives. My father (who she knew well) was in AA before he passed. I honestly did not expect to hear her make such a distasteful remark.

As one user here said - a lot of things have changed dramatically, some things have stayed exactly the same. I couldn’t sum it up better.

Physically I feel much better. My mind is sounder. But life still happens as do some struggles. 

During the very start of my sobriety, it seemed like life was intent to open the floodgates of my backlogged issues and neglected problems. 

I was going through a long streak of post acute withdrawal symptoms and anxiety. Physically I experienced every weird sensation and pain in the book, what almost drove me hypochondriac.

My SO left me by basically letting me know she can’t tolerate weakness and she has shit to do in her life. 

So 5 months ago I felt absolutely doomed and like there’s no foundation under my feet. I was sure I’d relapse. I was kinda looking forward to it, because like most of us, I too internalised my pain and misery what convinced me that it’s  just the way it’s meant to be for me.

Until one day I thought to myself - “well, if I’m meant to be miserable anyway, at least I can try to diversify that misery to make it less dull.” In a way this was induced by the popular quote - **“Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.”** 

I started to see a therapist once a week (because - guess what? Alcohol was a symptom not the cause). I started eating healthier, exercise more, read books again (which I used to love years ago, before alcohol consumed me in its isolating bubble), socialise more and generally **slowly** braking my behavioural patterns. 

As you may notice there are a lot of **verbs** in the previous paragraph. That’s because change, first and foremost, requires action. It requires actual effort. And time. 

I’m still a mess, but at least now I have people who help me sort it out and tools for myself. It’s a process and I’ve accepted it.

Putting in effort and trying and, most of the time, failing definitely doesn’t feel worse than a hangover or withdrawal, except that effort has the potential to make things better.

I’ve lurked here for awhile and have made a few half hearted attempts at not drinking in the past 18 months or so. I read This Naked Mind (which resonates with me like crazy) and have checked out some other resources. That’s really where it stopped though. 

I’m 35, married with two elementary-aged kiddos and have been fully engrossed in the “Mommy wine culture” for too long. I stay home with my kids so I’ve done my fair share of day drinking / it’s 5 o’clock somewhere-ing. Many of my friends are SAHMs, too, so there were many days of lounging by the pool while our kids played together and we enjoyed ourselves this summer. Too many, in fact. 

Something happened this summer (not a specific event, but something inside of me) and I found myself drinking more heavily, often by myself, late at night after everyone was in bed. I’ve started hiding bottles so my husband doesn’t see how much I’ve actually had. I’m grumpier more often & less of the mom I want to be. Houston, we have a problem. 

I’ve only ever tried “taking a break” for a few weeks when I’ve had a really extremely bad night or the occasional time or two my husband has mentioned maybe I’m drinking too much. I’ve never intended to quit long term or actually set a goal.

My goal is to make it through October 100% sober. I’ve read stories of others who tried a sober month then just kept going; I’m hoping that can be me. Right now though, I’m just going to focus on this month, and more specifically, today. I have a sober timer on my phone now and I like opening it up and watching the seconds tick by.

Wake up on the couch in the in the middle of night or very early morning. Realize that it’s 2:30a, TV blaring in the background, not totally sure where I am with what feels like a mouth full of cotton and a decent headache.  Realize that it’s MONDAY morning, that I’m supposed to be up in few hours for a massively busy schedule at work.  Begin the walk of shame through the kitchen, past the dining room, down the hallway and into the bedroom praying to god that I don’t wake up my wife as I climb into bed.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

“I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.”

― Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar

At one point, I had to choose my fig. The first one I tried was rotten. The good news is that the tree has produced much more than I needed, so I was able to reach for another one after I threw the first away. IWNDWYT!

The enjoyable things about drinking have been entering my mind lately: the anticipation of knowing you get to have some drinks and just let loose later while you’re waiting to get off work. The first drag of your first cigarette of the night while you’re four drinks in a dive bar. Feeling ~grown up~ and ~glamorous~ when you go out to a wine bar for a couple of glasses by yourself. I try to remind myself the miserable aspects of drinking are NEVER worth these short-term “rewards”. Sure I may drink one glass of wine at the wine bar- then go home and drink a whole bottle and feel like death in the morning. Or those drinks at the dive bar will have me a pleasant drunk for an hour at most then end with me blacking out then passing out at a table in the bar and wake up to having a bartender helping my incoherent ass order an Uber home. I can count on one hand probably the times I’ve gotten drunk and honestly thought it was worth the hangover. And I’ve gotten drunk hundreds of times. And all five times were back between the ages of 17-20. Back when I had somewhat of an “off-switch”. Before alcohol really became an addiction for me. I’m 24 now. Anyways, sorry for rambling. I’m proud of myself, but it is tough. Especially when alcohol is literally everywhere and seems like everyone around you is a “normal” drinker. IWNDWYT",18

I wasn't about to lose my job or my life wasn't going down the toilet or anything... I promise you I am a fully functioning adult with a full and loving life. I took September off for a fairly ""normal"" reason because I realized I was ingesting empty calories and self-sabotaging my diet and exercise progress. Then after 1.5 weeks without a drink something happened: I was only using the snooze button once instead of twice. I started being able to focus better at work, especially on days when the work was mindbogglingly boring. And overall I was in a more stable mood on those days where life was just trying to make me want to unwind with a drink.

I liked these new developments. So I decided to do a whole ""Sober September"" beyond my initial fitness goal. I'm still feeling the same way I did after the 1.5 week mark, it's not like I kept getting ""better"" to where I developed a super-power or anything. But now I'm actually scared of drinking again...

I always liked the taste of alcohol, so I would add one or two drinks to a meal a few times a week. Then I would let myself ""have a good time"" usually on Saturdays where I wanted a buzz while I played video games or something. Here's the thing, I don't miss this drinking. Actually, I'm now kind of repelled by the thought of alcohol because I found out I was negatively affected by so little (compared to my body mass).

But I might want to share a beer or two with my partner in social situations. And I do like a cold beer after working hard outside on the weekends. I understand the concept of moderation, I actually have a ""rule"" now where I will never touch a drink on a weekday ever again. But this weekend we are going to a concert and I would like to have a beer or two with my friends - but am afraid that just a few drinks will send me back to how I used to feel and then it will take another 1.5 weeks to get back to feeling good.

I do know my tolerance will have changed. I also know the argument that a glass of red wine every now and then can be good for you. Anybody out there ever go through something like this?? I would love to hear your story! From a physiological standpoint, I just don't ***EVER*** want to feel like I used to when I drank alcohol regularly, so I am being VERY cautious about approaching alcohol again. *And here is why I wanted to post to this subreddit... because of the possibility that maybe I should never have alcohol again?*

Back then I approached it all wrong. I craved alcohol, mourned its absence from my life, and focused on alcohol way too much. Annie Grace wasn't around back then. I was doing AA and it really did not work for me. It made me angry at meetings and I befriended some people that were not good people. I am NOT criticizing AA, just saying that it seemed to make me miss alcohol even more and I never bought the higher power thing because I'm atheist. I'm really happy it helps so many people.

This time around I've been listening to all kinds of audio books including Alcohol Lied to Me and This Naked Mind. I exercise regularly and meditate. I use breathing to relieve stress and anxiety. I've been doing cognitive behavioral therapy for a year now and it is literally teaching me how to cope with real adult life, a skill I didn't practice too much in my days of nightly drinking.

Tonight my husband and I went out to celebrate. We had a delicious dinner and I had a great time. Life is better. I have goals. I love myself. It amazes me what waking up not hating yourself for what you did the night before can do for your confidence and mood. I always appeared to be happy before but it was fleeting. I feel a deep seated contentment nowadays. 

Every now and then I feel the old urge but I've taught myself to talk back to it using everything that I learned from listening to This Naked Mind almost 3 times. I also listened to Michael Sealy's sleep hypnosis for alccoholism for like a month straight. Prior to these 90 days I had more days of sobriety for the entire year (since October 2018), but something clicked when I read something on r/stopdrinking about having a meanginful sobriety date.

Do you keep getting unwanted desires to drink? Even though you conciously know that you don't want to any more? It could be that your subconcious mind hasn't gotten the memo, so why not write one?

&#x200B;

Something kind and supportive, like the following:

Dear subconcious mind,

You know that alcohol isn't doing us any favours right now. There have been too many times where alcohol has ruined our morning and stopped us doing something positive with our day.

At the moment it would help us both if you could stop reminding me to drink. There are more important things we need to focus on right now and alcohol isn't one of them.

Can we focus instead on (insert something positive here) and then we can (get reward) please?

Yours truly, 

(name) concious mind.

&#x200B;

After writing it out, by hand, take some time to read it again out loud as if you were reading a bedtime story to your child. You will be surprised at how effective this can be. Treating your subconcious mind with love and kindness as well as with clear instructions can help a lot!  
Another useful point is to review this letter the following day and write a thank you note to your subconcious mind or a lets keep trying note as required.",19

Of course I would normally get smashed and part of me wants to and is asking if I really need to not drink all the time. And my anxiety has been crazy high without being able to drink. Is there a point when I won't have to think this much about a simple dinner with friends in a Friday? Will this anxiety chill out of I stick with this??,6

I had to sell one of my guitars yesterday to help pay bills and instead of buying booze I went to see Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.  I fucking love that guitar (black Gibson Les Paul) but I also love the idea of staying put where I am and I'm running out of options.

Today I had a super stressful day at work but didn't drink even though as I was walking out of work I was fantasizing about a bottle of Jack Daniels.

Instead I followed up on a second job offer and that plus what I would be spending on booze will hopefully help me extricate myself from this pit my life has become.

On to day 5 tomorrow.

Good luck all.",22

Thought I'd post here just to get it off my chest.

All the mental pain and suffering im dealing with every minute of the day is driving me insane. The voice is telling me to make it all go away with a bottle but i'm not giving up yet.

I'm so exhausted of fighting this thing, feeling like i'll be like this for the rest of my life, I won't be able to hold down a job, relationships, life achievements, ect... I'm not living, Im just sorta existing... 

Does anyone else feel like this? or have felt like this? Any tips on how to improve this low motivated useless feeling?

Not close to any of my family, don't have any friends who live locally and even then their too busy with life and I feel like a burden and they don't really 'get' it, if that makes sense, what this is like... Feeling very lonely,

Thank you, IWNDWYT.",6

I didn’t try new things, I canceled plans with friends at the last minute, I lied to people... all sorts of things that deviated from my values.

I’ve learned that living sober means living free. I went rock climbing today with a friend- a few months ago I would have paid money to NOT deal with the hassle of rock climbing and following through with plans. And it was SO FUN! This is why it’s so important to say yes to things. I’ve been spending time at the library, volunteering, reading for pleasure... It just feels good, like a lens has been brought into focus on life after years of being blurry.

There’s so much work to do to keep this happiness, but I’m looking forward to it. I’m also extremely grateful for the people who have helped me because it wouldn’t have been possible without them.

Hello friends, 

So tomorrow is payday. A huge trigger for probably most of us, but a massive hurdle for me particularly. Payday is a mixture of excitement because of the presence of money and of terror, as I am a person who is barely making due financially.

Since I've made it over 7 days, this is usually when I start feeling real emotions again. It is hard but I CHERISH this. I miss myself.

Every single 3 to 8 day clean period in the last decade - EVERY clean period has been achieved within the last 16 months.  EVERY clean period like this is SHATTERED on payday. Every. Time. Not psyching myself out here - I am preparing.

I consider myself a heavy alcoholic although I have close friends who are worse. I'm 31. Spent most of the last decade getting drunk every day. Not a single day went by between 2013 and  beginning of 2018 witbout black out levels of drinking. I have went to a meeting once. I plan to go to the second meeting tomorrow. I also was kindly given the Big Book so I will flip through it tonight. 

Anyone found any tricks or techniques in order to not let new money tempt you and burning a whole through your pocket? Maybe I should read a book on financing.

So I guess this post is kind of selfish. I just need some kind words, positivity, even just some IWNDWYT's. Once I'm not such a retch, I'll pay it forward with some insights of my own. Lastly this is an awesome, caring kick ass community. The main reason I've been able to string a few clean weeks together is absolutely this subreddit!

I had two years of sobriety and not smoking and threw it away. It felt so good to be sober and it was bliss to have myself back, my kid self, my optimistic self, the reliable self. 

Then when my twins were 8 months old and I ground to a nub, a sleep walking zombie, from feeding and diapering and napping and feeding and diapering and napping, a dark cave of endless menial tasks and no sleep, I said Fuck It, drove to a gas station, bought a pack of cigarettes, two bottles of wine, parked my car in our driveway, and proceeded to get drunk while watching a movie on my phone. It felt briefly liberating, I mean, what a boring thing to do if you're going to toss away your sobriety - get drunk in your driveway. 

My head killed me for a while week. The worst, longest hangover I've ever had, but I continued drinking through it. I kept thinking I'm still close to my sober self, I can still see her.  I can get back. 

Then I had a good 90 day period this year.  Things started getting easier, I could start to feel again and feel good and clean, then summer, pressure to drink on vacation turned into drinking every other day again.  Get hammered, waste the next day in anxiety ridden depression. 

Yesterday I hardly ate, drank a ton of wine (at least I'm not back to the rum), fought with people on the internet that I've known forever (a usual drink activity), fought with a fellow drunk friend, who thankfully can't remember the conversation bc she was drunk too, and just limped through the day hating myself and being a semi-absent mom. 

Please I want off this drunk train. I can't take it. I can't take the self loathing.

But over the past few years, even despite my drinking, I'd made a lot of improvements. I finally had a regular sleep schedule, my apartment was usually mostly clean-ish, I cooked dinner most nights and packed lunch for work most days. It wasn't much, but 23 days ago, I was doing pretty well for me (if you didn't count the 60 beers I was knocking back every week).

And now... I can't get to sleep at night, I can't get up the motivation to cook or clean, I'm spending tons of money on takeout and eating just so bad. All I can seem to do is go to work, come home, smoke a million cigarettes, eat cookie dough, and watch tv or read for hours. How the fuck is it possible that I was more productive when I was drinking? I sincerely worked really hard to get where I was, and I'm pissed that all of it seems to have just evaporated as soon as I started getting sober.

Look, it's still better than drinking, and I really do mean that. I feel strong in my sobriety and I'm really proud of and happy with my decision to quit. But seriously what the hell? Is this, like, a thing? Please tell me this is normal and my motivation and ability to sleep like a normal person is going to return. I'm already so sick of looking at my filthy apartment and feeling bad about ordering takeout again and wandering around in the middle of the night and being tired all the time.

2019-10-02 17:37:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dch0ap/functional_alcoholic_looking_to_cut_back/,"""Functional"" Alcoholic Looking To Cut Back Significantly.","  

This might be a little lengthy, going to be some rambling but I just feel the need to write this down. I’ll put a summary at the bottom. 

I think I am what people would call a functional alcoholic. I have no problem cutting the drinks off the night before work and getting a good night rest and going to work the next day. I work very long shifts and don’t have any cravings for it. But with my long hours, I have a lot of days off. Of course, on those days off I’m boozing. Thing is, I’m still productive, I don’t get wasted and pass out and I legit don’t even think my wife knows the frequency of this. I basically get a few drinks in me fast and coast the rest of the day. Even drunk, I do way more work than my wife (part of the reason I drink so much, won't get into that). I’m talking cooking, cleaning, house maintenance, etc. I’m not wasting away on the couch. 

Sort of my problem is, this ridiculous amount of drinking really doesn’t affect my life that much. The two negatives I see with this is, health and money. And even then, I don’t notice either of those currently. I exercise, maintain a normal BMI and eat super healthy. Have yearly check ups and have a clean bill of health. But of course, I know this could easily catch up with me, it’s not good for my liver, stomach and brain. And I’m comfortable financially so I can afford it, but it would nice to have a couple extra hundred dollars a month. On the other hand, I enjoy it, it’s simply fun being drunk. It’s also a stress reliever, not a healthy one but it is. Sober, my mind is all over the place, worrying and stressing about this or that. When I’m drinking, it shuts that out. 

All that said, this is the perfect time for me to make a change. The summer is a huge trigger for me. I just really enjoy sitting out in my backyard having beers. Now that the shit weather is here, I see this as a time to really get this under control. Cutting out alcohol all together would be fantastic, I just know how bad it is for my health, but I don’t think I could do it. But if I could simply cut back to social drinking, that would be HUGE. I’m not that social of a person so that would be a few times a month. 

Yesterday I had one final session of day drinking, finished off all the booze in the house. At least now I can’t just go to the beer fridge and say “fuck it”, nothing is in there, I’ll be shit outta luck. Just have to keep some control and not head to the beer store. Easier said than done obviously. 

So, we’ll see how this goes, I feel like getting these thoughts “on paper” will somehow motivate me or keep me accountable. And I’ll make it a habit to read this sub every morning. 

SUMMARY: I’m a “functional” alcoholic looking to cut down massively for my health and wallet. Using this post as some sort of motivation. Day one is today.",4
2019-10-02 17:25:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dcgu3p/cutting_back/,Cutting Back...,"I want to preface this by saying I do not want to encourage anyone to try cutting back vs. being 100% sober if sober is the way to go for you. I think the people on here are incredible veterans and I don’t mean to be counterproductive or disrespectful to anyone who’s kicking ass at being sober...

That being said, for me, I’ve been cutting back consistently since 2016. This is what I’ve been doing and what I’ve been experiencing in terms of challenges and successes. 

I chose to cut back because I wanted to give “moderation” a real shot first and see how it goes. I’ve been known to get blackout drunk at parties and I’ve been avoiding big gatherings like those for a long time. 2016 was the worst year of my life (for personal reasons) and I was drinking daily for most of it. I didn’t get drunk every night, but I did have 2-6 drinks on a regular basis and I felt like total dogshit every day and honestly don’t remember much of that year. I’ve always been fit and self-disciplined and I found that that all went out the window very fast when you drink regularly. Since then, I cut it back to only drinking on the weekends. I’ve felt better and I’m in a better life situation overall, but I haven’t lost the 20 lbs that I’ve gained in 2016 and I still have trouble with sleep, anxiety, depression, and all of those other things that pair so awfully with alcoholism. 

I went a straight 30 days sober last November and I found that it was a rewarding experience. But Christmas rolled around and I caved, and since then I haven’t been able to ditch it completely. However, I have found that a few tools work well for me. First as I mentioned, I avoid big parties and get togethers where I know a lot of drinking will take place. My family and friends love to drink and I usually get drunk in these types of situations so I avoid them all together or I’ll make an appearance early in the night and duck out. I also only drink on the weekends. I’m working on cutting that down to only Friday Saturday and not on Sunday. I don’t drink during the work week, even if it’s an occasion where I’ll meet someone out or a celebratory thing. Because my rule is, I don’t drink during the work week (period). 

When I drink, I go out and buy specifically what I want for a night and it’s within a bracket of what I will be satisfied with and what will NOT get me drunk. And it depends on the situation. For example, if I’m meeting with a group of friends for dinner I’ll allow myself ahead of time to have a two beer limit. And I stick to it. If I’m say, having a night in with my spouse and I know we’ll be hanging out watching movies for 5 hours, then I can have 4 drinks during the coarse of the evening. I’ve found when I plan this out ahead of time, I am successful. But here’s the kicker, when I don’t have a plan, like a couple of weeks ago when I was at a family get together and they have endless booze and I have no game plan, well, then I’ve failed. So it’s important to me to have a game plan, a concrete number, the exact supply at hand, and no more than that. 

I’m not saying it’s easy. People on here have said moderation is mental gymnastics. It is. I’m not gona lie. To me though, I would say it has been enjoyable. Moderation is better than getting drunk. Is it better than being sober? Well I don’t know, I’ve never really been 100% sober for longer than a couple of months at a time between 20-30 years old (current age). There have been times when I’ve failed but again, it’s either because my plan sucked or I was in a situation that was more than I could handle. The weird thing is because I have things planned out, My cravings have gone down. I think this is partly because I have not been a daily drinker for over 3 years. This is also because I do not drink impulsively or on a whim. I plan it out ahead of time so if I know I’m having two beers on Friday when I’m meeting friends, I don’t need that Tuesday night beer with a coworker. It’s comparable to when I played sports in college and I’d plan my cheat meals on Saturday so it kept me from eating junk food on the other days. I’m getting better at planning and I’m getting better at dodging parties. I also feel clearer and more in control now that I’m not get hammered or experiencing hangovers nearly as much anymore. 

Maybe I’ll get better as time goes on and I’ll have more to say on here for people that are interested. Or maybe I’ll fall face first and come on here to lick my wounds in your helping hands. To sum it up, moderation is possible (for me, maybe for you, maybe not) but it’s not easy and it does require a lot of work and pre-planning. I hope some of you find this interesting and helpful. Some of you are probably laughing at me, and who knows, you might be right, or not, we’ll see what happens. All I know is that it’s Wednesday and I can confidently say IWNDWYT",1

I was relatively high functioning, never lost any jobs, did get a DUI and lost the opportunity to spend the rest of my life with a brilliant partner not to mention numerous other failed relationships and massive social fuck ups.

I started posting, started getting a bit more involved on this sub. My only friends. The only people who seemed to understand, maybe the only ones who could understand. In dark times, very dark times you guys have been like family to me. 

My main reason for writing this is to let you know if you have just started or about to start your journey to freedom, there IS hope and you can do it. 

One day at a time. 

If you have built a wall around yourself and can’t get out, talk to someone- in real life or online - read the stories for others who have been in the same situations maybe not as bad, maybe much much worse.  You may be surprised just how much this can help you. Really. 

You are not alone. 

My other reason for writing this is to express my gratitude to all of the sobernauts here. Most of you will never know how much you have helped me and no doubt countless other people here. 

Words will never be able to express my gratitude properly.  

Humble thanks, a 365 day old tradition continues 🙏❤️🙏",190

Twice I did in first few days, drinking far too much. The result was the day after I felt rough and miserable. For the last week or so I've not drank. It's been lovely. It was honestly starting to feel like drinking was like a job and something I had to do to be making most of my holiday. Lunch, I'll have a wine, maybe few gins reading on an afternoon. Few beers on a night and maybe a whisky before bed. Wake up rough, repeat.

The last week has been a revelation. No hang over, no late night making bad decisions and ruining the next day. Being present and actually here has been great. Sober holidays for me from now on. At least while I've a young child.

I was tired of destroying relationships, jobs and sometimes ending up in jail (you know, the usual stuff that a 20 year long drinking habit will land you).  I took a year away from bartending to work on my sobriety and decided that recently I was ready to get behind the stick again and see how I felt.  So far it’s been great.  It feels good to be able to do something I love again with a clear head and there has been almost zero temptation to drink.  I say almost zero because I occasionally have that thought, but it’s very quickly quashed and happens with the same irregularity in just normal non work-related life.  I’ve digressed purely for a little background, but on to the topic at hand.  

I’m serving a full bar, a few friends and old regulars are there and everyone is having a good time when a guest asks if I remember her.  She said I was wasted at her bar and trying to have a conversation with her about mezcal apparently.  I just reply “oh god, no I don’t remember.”  She counters with the fact that we’ve met more than once and I was always wasted.    
It had to be more than a year ago then, I said.  She found it funny that I could be at least a little specific about the time as she couldn’t exactly remember when it was and I told her that I had quit drinking a year ago and would have remembered meeting past that.  
She smiled, said congratulations and reintroduced herself.  I’m sure that her past experience with me was less than pleasant and I was really happy that this one was different.  Because I was sober.  I’m still not perfect, I have a lot to work on, but today I’m able to do that because I don’t drink.  I hope these sober ramblings weren’t too boring and that everyone here is having a great day or at least a better one because you’re not drinking.  Iwndwyt.  Cheers.",256

last night i had the misfortune of coming home to find my daughter in her room naked with another boy. while i didn't catch them in the act, I'm assuming they were sexually active. after almost losing my mind on the boy, i kicked him out after failed attempts to call his parents, then drove my daughter to her mother's after also failing to reach her over the phone. it hasn't been easy as a single father, and my daughter made it loud and clear that she wants to live with her mother...loud and clear with a lot of profanity laced blame. it was really hard to hear her say that all of my change, my sobriety, all of it was just a lie... i just told her I'm sorry, and that i loved her before she closed the car door. i had went to my girlfriend's place afterwards, and went into her liquor cabinet, grabbed the vodka, opened it, smelled it, felt the warmth of the aroma, and just sat down with the bottle in between my legs. i think an hour passed before i got up, put the bottle back, and crawled into bed. now I'm at work, wondering if i should try to battle thru the teary-eyed breakdowns, or just say fuck it, fuck everything, take the rest of the week off and numb myself....

The last few months I have been trying to get into sparkling waters. It was not super easy for me at first (as my 16 year old daughter so delicately put it, “It tastes like TV static!!” Haha)

But I’ve been getting more and more used to it and have found some I really like. But trying different brands/flavors can be a challenge when they come in 8-12 packs so if you don’t like them (ie: Dasani Peach sparkling really tastes like an ultra light beer. Might be your thing actually, its not mine) so now I have 7 more sitting in the fridge.

Anyway my favorites so far are:

- S.Pellegrino dark cherry and pomegranate and also the Lemon zest!! SO good (love the light carbonation but on the extra expensive side)

- ICE black raspberry and grapefruit (all of them decent)

- Dasani Black cherry (love the price on these but after the peach I’m afraid to try others)

- Bubly I have only tried lemon lime so far, its good but they have a ton of flavors. (Edit. Just bought a cherry after reading a suggestion on this sub, really good!)

So any suggestions anyone has not only on sparkling water but any other mock-tail they are into I am all ears!

Have a great sober sparkling day everyone! ✨",6

All I know is that I don’t enjoy it anymore, my hangovers are grinding and I don’t want to end up like my mum.

To be an alcoholic is the biggest reason to quit, but you can also just, you know, quit drinking. Just like you would soda for weight or carbs for energy. The benefits are endless, here are some I’ve found:

 - better sleep 
 - weight loss 
 - more energy 
 - better in social situations 
 - less social anxiety 
 - better memory 
 - mental clarity 
 - more present to loved ones 
 - a better sense of my identity (who I am)
 - better skin
 - looking younger

Since I truly enjoy the taste of beer, I have been considering getting some quality n/a (Clausthauler dry-hopped I've found is actually quite good) in order to curb cravings. But part of me wonders if this might not be a good idea, as it could make me more tempted toward the real thing.

My current thought process is that I should hold put for a couple of weeks just to get myself acquainted with not consuming anything that resembles an alcoholic beverage. Then maybe I'll try some n/a beer and see how I feel about it at that point.

What are your experiences with n/a beer? Has it worked for you in terms of keeping cravings away? Does it make you crave real beer even more?",3

I agree.,"I had 2 medication-free births, and just rode the waves of pain. it wasn’t fun at all, but I learned that even my worst contractions last about 30 seconds, and the peak was about 10 seconds long. So I knew if I counted 30, the worst would be at 15, and then it would start to abate. I think it’s the same being sober. I know now that I will feel pain. Sadness. Anxiety. But they are waves. If you know that they were going to pass, they are bearable. And when you try to block the pain, you are missing out on the full experience of life. Part of the joy of childbirth was when the pain ended. And knowing that I had been able to withstand it.  I felt so proud and strong. During my six months sober I have had many painful moments. But I try to see them like contractions. And i tell myself, this too shall pass.  And I feel proud and strong that I have felt the pain and survived. I do not need to numb it with drugs. IWNDWYT",111

Because of this I have committed to quit drinking for good. I have been a problem drinker my entire life , from the DWIs to getting into fights with friends family and strangers, and just generally making an ass out of myself. So I know down to my bones that drinking is a big problem for me and I need to quit long term.It was easy for me to just give up drinking. That is, up until a few weeks ago. 

I just really miss being intoxicated, I've used alcohol, weed, and on rare occasions stronger stuff  since I was like 13 (31 now) . And now that the trauma of being arrested for a felony level offense is past me a bit my dumb lizard brain is trying to convince me that a few drinks would be a positive thing. I know this is wrong , but I'm just so bored, depressed, whatever. I hate my new job and I just want a 4 pack of one of those awesome fall seasonals that have come out. 

I really just need some motivation and suggestions on stuff to do instead of going out and drinking. Now that the weathers cooling I can't go to the lake or whatever. Has anyone else been able to quit for a few months and then out of the blue start dealing with strong cravings ? And lastly, and completely unrelated, any suggestions on non driving jobs a former outside account manager could get ? I'm worried that my criminal record after this hit is going to force me into a career I hate.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I've been feeling very depressed and out of place lately. I live in a house with a family and I feel like I really don't belong, but I'm stuck here because I don't have a car and my roommate working the same schedule as me is the only reason I can make it to work everyday. Even if I did have a car, there's no way I could afford my own place with the money I make now.

Life feels very dead end and hopeless. I'm still dependent on other people and that feels like it will never change. I just want to numb myself, even for a short while. Even a small break from these feelings sounds like such relief. 

I can't walk in the sunshine, I don't live somewhere safe enough to walk. I can't even take a relaxing bath because the tub is broken, stained, and disgusting. I'm locked in my room when I'm not at work unless another person gives me the okay to leave by inviting me to wherever they're going. My whole entire life has been like this and I don't see it ever changing. I don't see the point in anything anymore. How can it get better when it's not changed for 25 years? So what's the point in sobriety if I'll still be just as miserable and unable to do anything about it.

Every other time I’ve gone this long I’ve looked forward to drinking. But this time I’m drinking at the end. And it’s been more difficult this time because of that. Every other time has been pretty easy because there was “light at the end of the tunnel” and I knew I’d be back to my habit soon enough. 

With this, I dunno. I don’t have a real goal other than not drinking. My nights have been pretty lonely as I live alone (girlfriend lives with her parents and has some medical issues so I don’t get to see her every day). Drinking always alleviated some of that loneliness since it was something to do. It would distract me. I could push away the loneliness. 

Now? I’m left with it. And I’m left wanting some form of escape. Before alcohol, it was heroin or benzos or coke or whatever I could get my hands on. After I got clean, I went straight to alcohol. I’d rationalize it by sayin it was a hobby since it was craft beer. Never mind that each of those beers were usually 12% and 16oz. 

I feel like I’m not drinking but I’m not getting any better. Sure I’m saving money to put towards a down payment on a house and an engagement ring. And yeah I’ve lost a few pounds over the week due to not drinking my dinner. I see the benefits already. But I’m not improving myself otherwise. 

Still, I guess any progress is still progress. At least that’s what I’ve been telling myself for the past few years. Maybe I’m just expecting too much from the first week. I know when I kicked the rest of my drug habits it took me years to really improve myself in any significant way. But I’m impatient as hell haha. 

Anyway, I don’t really know why I’m writing this here. I could have easily just written this in my journal and kept it to myself but here I am typing it out on reddit instead. 

Regardless, I won’t drink with y’all tonight :) 

Things may not have changed over night for me, but every step is still progress. And any progress is still progress.

This is huge for me. I'm 25 and it's the first time in probably 8+ years I've gone this long without alcohol.

Since the first week of college, I've been smoking pot quite regularly. It used to be every day, but now I'm down to about 4-5 times a week. The cutback isn't really intentional, it's just the way my life is now.

I truly believe my problem lies with alcohol. Do I have a tendency to obsess over things (including games, people, cheese, and sometimes cannabis)? Yes, I do, but those things don't have the same negative impact on my life that alcohol has.

I've been attending AA meetings and I have really been enjoying many aspects. Listening to and speaking to other people who struggle with alcohol has been a very important factor in my ability to make it this far. To be honest, without AA meetings and dozens of alcoholics checking in on me in my first few weeks, I believe I would have drank by now. I'm just not sure the 12 steps and all of the lifestyle changes are right for me.

One thing that people have been ""pushing"" in AA meetings is being abstinent from all mind-altering substances including cannabis. I totally get the idea and that for some this is a necessary part of their recovery, but I just don't see how it would be for me.

One woman (who claims she used to smoke a lot of pot in addition to drinking) told me if I smoked a joint, it could alter my mind enough to make me want to drink. I had to hold myself back from laughing because I just haven't had that experience of being altered that much by cannabis.

Can't I just not drink, but smoke a little pot?",13

It's not going to be easy in the beginning and stuff is going to feel very foreign and strange, but you can do it. I'm not someone that hops on here and   
normally talks shit. I had a feeling today that someone might be in the same boat I was in months ago and need some help. My suggestion for you is to put down the booze and go to an AA meeting in your area. You don't have to stay the whole time, you don't even have to talk. All that I'm asking you to do is try something different, listen and not show up drunk. Alcoholics Anonymous helped me get my life back on track and I'm someone who years ago wouldn't be caught dead in one of those meetings. I also don't go all the time (only when I really need to or need a reality check) or try to advertise sobriety publicly.

I struggle with my alcoholism daily. It is not easy to talk about and it sure as hell isn't something I wanted to stop at first. I was on the verge of losing so much of my life from drinking and I'm just glad I stopped when I did. So if you are out there and toying with the idea of quitting drinking, ask yourself some serious questions and put yourself in an uncomfortable place. I quit for a year, relapsed and got sober again for 4 months before relapsing again. It's all part of recovery and I'm not perfect. The important thing is that you get back on the horse and keep trying. My alcoholic brain is trying to kill me every single chance it gets. I can stop it by just doing one thing and that's not drinking.

Usually to excess and many times involving cocaine, which I can’t afford and I honestly don’t want to be a part of my life either. I would never do it sober. I have wasted so much money and time on alcohol and my anxiety and depression have worsened.

I woke up this morning and due to random circumstances with my car, I didn’t have a way to get alcohol after work. And I paused and realized how anxious i was and realized that I don’t want to live like this and if I didn’t do something now, I’d be looking back next year, still gaining weight and being unhappy and blowing tons of money on alcohol and blacked out night.

So I’m here, at 8pm, laying in bed. Sober. And it’s honesty kind of weird. I’ve been thinking about checking out an AA meeting tomorrow, but I’m 24 and it feels weird to be that young and going to a meeting. 

Thanks for all the posts and support, I’ve been browsing this sub for months and I guess making a day one post has to mean I serious!",17

I have been texting every friend and family member I have to try to engage in conversation to keep my mind busy. Video games aren't helping like they use to and nobody is responding to my texts. I probably screwed up down the line to make them not care.  I lost a friend last week to cirrhosis of the liver from extreme alcoholism. Today was his funeral. I expected to see the benches of the funeral home to be packed. The place was only half full. I really took in some deep thought as to why there weren't more people. Yes, some were out of state and couldn't make it, but if it's anything like my alcohol abuse, it makes a lot of sense. I have selfishly pushed people out of my life because of my addiction. I didn't do it on purpose, but alcohol makes people forget. It's a substance to make you not care and forget about things. I hope that today is day 1. Also, mortality sucks.

Edit: Thanks for the support hoping to have a first day.",10
2019-10-01 20:18:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dc2hb0/the_next_few_months_are_going_to_be_a_real/,The next few months are going to be a real struggle for me...,"Well, I've made it this far, yay! But October, November and December... I just don't know.  I'm not trying to set myself up for failure by any means, but the holidays haven't been my strongest area in regards to sobriety for a long time.  Here are some reasons why:

\- I've spent Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years in jail once... all because of my drinking.  My birthday is in January and I was released 4 days before it, only to relapse *again.*

\-This October is the 1 year anniversary of a 2nd divorce that I did not want.  This one isn't really a huge issue now, but ever since this time last year, I have been suffering from extreme loneliness and isolation.  And [apparently](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/05/ce-corner-isolation) that can kill you.  It just seems harder for someone in their early 40's like me to make real and meaningful relationships, as it seems most people my age are married, have children, a career, etc.  That and I live in a somewhat smallish town with not a whole lot of social outlets except events surrounding alcohol.  And AA? Ugh... I've done AA to death and honestly have no desire to go back right now.

\-Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving to me was once a time of family gatherings with tons of food and fulfilling and enjoyable times with others.  At one time it would have been me, my girlfriend/fiance/wife at the time, my older half-brother and his wife, my aunt and uncle with their 3 children and others.  Unfortunately my older half-brother is inundated with his life situations, and I burnt my bridges with that side of the family due to my drinking, so the past several Thanksgiving's have been anything but enjoyable.  I haven't seen any of those family members since my father passed away suddenly on August 12th, 2015.  I feel the one that hurts the most is my half-brother, since he only lives an hour away and we share the same biological father - that and we were at one time extremely close - the same being said for one of my cousins.  She was like my best friend at the time... there was nothing we couldn't talk and share with each other, and we had each others back through good times and bad times.  Now I don't even know if they even know if I'm alive or not.

It seems that Thanksgiving from a social stand point seems to be all about Black Friday and how much money you can save by getting up at 3am in the morning and waiting in long lines at Walmart for some off-brand TV.  Or doing the same, just online.  Screw the people part, right?

\-Christmas.  Basically Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V the Thanksgiving part here.  Except that my parents always felt that Christmas was more about kids rather than adults, and once I grew up, they stopped decorating and what not.  I have had some *wonderfu*l Christmas' in the past as an adult, but again, it all centered around relationships - both romantic and family/friends.

And once again, society is taking things even further with all the shopping and sales and what not for Christmas, instead of focusing on what really matters.

And for me that's people. (That and I am Christian, but I also know that Jesus was more-than-likely born in the Spring or Autumn, and that December 25th was chosen to combat pagan holidays at the time, but I freakin' digress)...  But when it comes down to it, it's all about people.  And I have no people - not in my personal/close life anyways.

I realize that it takes effort and determination to make new relationships, which is something I am lacking at the moment.  So the loneliness I am dealing with is both a by-product of my drinking, and self-made as well.  I'm not sure what's worse right now:  My loneliness, my lack of purpose and meaning, or that I feel like I've done too much, gone too far, and that any sort of ""recovery"" other than being sober is hopeless.  I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.

I apologize for the ""Debbie-downer"" post, but I just needed to get this off my chest.  And I hope and pray I can come out of the next few months as unscathed as possible.  I also hope and pray that none of you are in the same situation I am, because no-one deserves this and I wouldn't wish this on anyone.

Thanks for reading, and IWNDWYT!

I managed to get to that point a little over a year-and-a-half ago.  Very fortunate after a lot of hard work.  As a result I do not get cravings for alcohol during the week, but for some reason knowing that I am doing an entire month sober (hopefully) is making me think about alcohol every day during the work week now when that did not used to be the case.  I did not drink yesterday or today, but thinking about the fact that I am supposed to be sober (even on days when I was not going to drink anyway) is making me more focused on alcohol and increasing the desire to drink because I am thinking about it so much more.  This happened last January during Dry January (though, fortunately, I made it the whole month, but it was rough).  Knowing that I should not drink on the weekends (my problem area) is making the rest of the time more intense.  Any pointers?  Thank You for reading.",2

Thing is, today I don't have the normal anguish over not being able to drink. I'm actually pretty OK with it. So my question for other readers of this book is: did it work for you? If so, how did it work? Was it a sudden, drastic loss of cravings; or was it a slow and subtle process?

We have worked so hard on our marriage and yet I have retraumatised our children via these horrible outbursts.  

Even when violence is not there, drinking and arguing make the fights about 1,0000 times worse.  And the guilt and remorse I feel today is just almost too much to take.

I need to truly stop drinking. I have been studying Buddhist principles and just the fact that drinking purposefully wrenches you from the moment should be reason enough. 

So October 1, is the day I get back in the drivers seat of my life and truly love my husband and children back to health.

I have been drinking for about 6-7 years. It would get that bad that I would drive drunk to get to the liquor stores, be completely drunk on airplanes while traveling alone and spending time on every airport bar, making sure I always had plenty of wine home, drinking secretly, almost missing to put Christmas present under the tree (my husband woke me up while I was sleeping on bathroom floor), missed to pick up my daughter from airport, falling asleep under the table till the morning or pizza on my lap. The events list would go on and on. Because my husband had problems being faithful in our marriage I would always confront him and blame him to justify my drinking with the hurt he caused me (I am very happy that we are still together). I started visiting alcohol addiction doctor per my husbands request about 2 years ago. He gave me a medicine which I would start taking and stop taking in cycles since then. I would continue drinking saying my problem is not that bad and I am in control of it. My husband hates to see me drunk and every morning he would be mad about it. We would speak and I would make up reasons (I believed I had good reasons) and promises. 

The facts are that I am now keeping a record of my drinking on DBTC! app (which was recommended by one Redditor here). So in July, I was drunk two times, in August I was sober, September three times drunk, and now I will see what happens next. I have learned from all of you here how difficult is this struggle. Just recently I looked at my husband and I felt horrible how much pain I have caused him and how alone I left him. I realized how I lost the connection and care we use to have. I am hoping to rebuild this. I turned into some kind of a monster, gave myself the right to act irresponsibly and blamed others for it. I hope to continue to see life in a better light and learn more about being better in every way. I am so grateful to all Redditors who share their stories here, from which I have learned so much to recognize how bad is mine. All of you who won this fight, you are giving me the hope that one day I can beat this myself. Thank you all!",8

I went out with friends and my girlfriend to a club/bar over the weekend and it was definitely a challenge and pretty bold of me to dive in to this sort of situation so soon.

It definitely solidified for me that I CAN be strong but that I shouldn’t put myself in uncomfortable situations that tempt my willpower. Why make this more difficult for myself? 

I was dancy at some points, but mostly stayed seated and jammed out to the songs with my friends. I couldn’t bring myself to get out there and dance quite yet but it may just be because this particular place is a suckfest. I’ll probably try another club at some point and see how that works out. 

PROS: When it was time to go home it felt good to know that I could get in the car and not worry about being pulled over or if I did I wouldn’t be under the influence and I got my friends home safe. I have NEVER been DD. I have driven home when I shouldn’t have and have allowed my friends to drive home when they shouldn’t have because they swore they were fine. This was an awesome experience for me. When I woke up I didn’t have a splitting headache, I wasn’t dehydrated and my feet didn’t hurt from dancing numbingly for 3-4 hours. 

I wasn’t short-fused. I wasn’t hyper-sensitive. I still felt like I was funny and like I could come out of my sober shell the more I face dry outings. 

CONS: I couldn’t stand my girlfriend. She said she wouldn’t buy beer in the bar after pregaming and she did exactly that - she couldn’t resist buying beer and it pissed me off. Don’t say one thing and do another. I told her exactly how I felt and that I hope she will consider not drinking or practicing moderation as well. I wasn’t even drunk and I cried this night because she was nitpicking at me and making me feel like I was doing everything wrong. I won’t elaborate but we argued briefly and had a long talk once she sobered up a little. We do have great communication but I found her intolerable that night. She isn’t normally like this. She’s the love of my life and is attentive, patient and kind with me usually. So I feel like I don’t want to see her drunk anymore. I truly saw that side in a new light and I found it extremely unattractive.

My friend asked me twice to drink. Said things like “just a little” or “cmon really”. That was like, surprisingly easy though. Saying no to someone else like HELLOOOO I said I’m not drinking so don’t be an ass and push me. I don’t like being told what to do and the more people doubt me the more I want to prove them wrong.

I know it will continue to be challenging. I’m up for it though.",9

I am 39 years old and have been a fairly heavy drinker since I turned 21.

I've had a lot of fun with alcohol, but I've also had my fair share of regret, embarrassment and shame.

My father drank daily and heavily when I was young, and was verbally abusive to me, my mother and my sister. I swore to myself I would never become an alcoholic like him. Of course, that all changed once I started college.

When I was 21, I was driving home drunk and T-boned a truck that was parked on the shoulder of the road for sale. I knocked it over on its side. In a panic, and thinking I just hit a telephone pole (I had passed out behind the wheel), I fled the scene and made it home with my totalled car. Police found my license plate at the scene, came to my house and arrested me for DUI (I blew a .23). Thankfully my parents loved me enough to cover the cost for fines, , and the guy selling the truck didn't sue for damages, he was just glad I didn't get hurt.

I went with my dad to a couple of his AA meetings after that incident, but as an atheist, I didn't care for the religious aspect of it. Hearing others share their stories was interesting, however.

I fell off the wagon pretty quickly and spent most of my time in my parent's house for the next couple years, unemployed, spending savings from my last job on booze and hanging out in online chatrooms. Finally at 23 I decided to make something of myself and moved out to be on my own.

 I started school again, but dropped out halfway because I was too focused on partying. I made new friends and started a new band, played some gigs here and there, got drunk at all of them... went through a few different jobs and roommates...skipped out on several months rent because I spent everything at the bar. 

At my lowest point, I had been fired from a job, and just days later got my car impounded because I wasnt paying for registration or insurance. Lost my license again. I was depressed and lonely, drowning my sorrows in alcohol. All I had left was the occasional practice or gig with my band, and a part time job as... yes... a bartender. At my favorite pub. 

Things started to get a little better when I started getting closer to a female friend of mine. We were both in need of a roommate so we moved in together, and fell in love a month later. We drank together, started new careers together, got married, and bought a house just a couple of years ago. We lifted each other out of our slumps and have been on the up ever since, even now.

Although I've never been happier or in a better position in my adult life now, there is still the dark side of me that wants to drink all his stress away. The guy who sneaks to the liquor store in the morning to get a few nips in before his day starts. The guy who hides empty bottles and then forgets about them, and his wife finds them months later. The guy that doesn't know when to stop when we're at a gathering and embarrasses her in front of her family, the guy that sneaks in an extra shot when were at the bar and she goes to the restroom. The guy who works from home and just can't wait until his shift is over before fishing a beer out of the fridge. The list goes on and on.

My wife likes to drink too, but she knows her limits and doesn't fiend like I do. She is a saint for putting up with me, and I love her more than anything.

Last night I had a minor breakdown while we were having a chat about my problem. I cried and confessed about everything I had hidden from her, and promised her that I would fix this. I need to do it. I'm unhealthy, my libido sucks, and I get angry over really stupid things. I feel like shit every morning. I'm unproductive because all I want to do is sit around and drink.

Sorry that this is so long. But I do love to write because it helps me feel better, and maybe it will help me not drink anymore.",3

An abbreviated version of my life; I have really, really bad anxiety and have been self-medicating with alcohol and weed (on occasion) for the last few years. I stop for a few weeks to a month, and then something happens that makes me turn back to drinking to just...calm down.

I’m not in the best position...currently in a job that has me working a lot and paying me not enough. I make too much for Medicaid but too little to afford health care on my own, and I have a few medical problems I can’t get taken care of right now (so no anxiety meds). I wasted a LOT of money by being young and mismanaging it. My credit score is wrecked. All of my money goes to rent and bills and...alcohol right now. On the outside everyone thinks I’m doing great in life, which makes me feel even worse. I can’t really talk to anyone I know about how I feel inside, which is depressed and...just like a trash individual for screwing up so bad and not knowing how to get out of it.  I’m anxious when I need to do almost any task, then I usually procrastinate and the result is even worse. This is the last place I saw my life; drinking alone in a bar at 5 PM before I go to one of my side jobs that pays me a little extra. Some days I can’t move. Can’t get out of bed. Can’t face anything. 

Those of you who are/were in a bad place and chose not to drink to medicate or fix your problems...what stops you? I’d appreciate some help. Thanks in advance.",1

I had a couple of whiskeys in me and was pulled over four times that one night and let go every time except for the last one. Each time I got pulled over, I was driving faster than I was the previous time. The first time I got stopped, I was sleeping in my car. Not driving, just sleeping: passed out behind the wheel. Then I got pulled over for doing 100 miles per hour, then 120. The last time, I was doing 142...I had just lost the will to be a part of the planet. It was a tough time. My friend had died suddenly. It was late at night and it was a very nihilistic time. Getting woken up in a jail in Bakersfield to sign an autograph at four o'clock in the morning was when I said to myself, ""This is not the way I want to live my life.""

(2012, on quitting drinking) I've always had a love-hate relationship with alcohol and drugs: I love the freedom that they seem to afford you by breaking you out of your conventional thinking but they always lead you to the confining trap of being sort of-in one form or another or to one degree or another-addicted to the freedom that you feel drugs and alcohol are affording you.

My Story:

Everyday drinker for 20 years.  I’d only take nights off from alcohol if I was sick (very) or was in a dry situation/event  (which I always avoided if possible).  When things are at their worst, I drink heavily on a Friday night, then wake up very hungover on Saturday morning and do a few shots just to be able to function.  I continue for the rest of the weekend and by Monday morning I feel like I’m gonna die.  I usually don’t function well at work till lunchtime on Tuesday.

I come from a long line of addicts and alcoholics.  My grandfather on my dad’s side died at 44 years of age.  My uncle got addicted to heroin while fighting in Vietnam and died of Aids by age 41.  Both of my parents are functioning alcoholics, they drink heavily every day even now that they are well into their 60s.  Most of my siblings are alcoholics.

My grandmother on my mothers' side was an alcoholic.  At times things with her were so bad that my mother, as an 8-12 year old had to raise herself and her two smaller siblings.  My grandfather was a habitual drinker. I spent most of my time with him during his retirement and there was never a day that the bottle of Jack Daniels wasn’t out of the cabinet by 4pm (at the latest).

I suffer from anxiety and low self esteem tho I’ve managed to have a very successfully career as an Engineer.  I have 2 small kids and my biggest fear in my life is not giving myself to them fully and regretting it later in life.

Although I’ve had stretches of not drinking in the last few years (longest was 30 days) I’ve finally realized that I can’t stop on my own and that I need help.  I need to come clean to those closest to me about how bad my problem is.  I hope that going to meetings and being around other sober people in recovery could help me figure this thing out and stay strong.

Thanks for reading. ",4

Since I've stopped drinking he thinks it's a bit of a joke and has continually joked that I should ""have a drink it's good for you"". I've never had a problem with drinking I've just chosen to stop and I feel much better for it both physically and mentally and I'm pretty sure I'm going to stay sober for good now. If I was an alcoholic would he behave like this? I have a great relationship with my dad and we are very close but he's really pissing my off by keeping on jokingly encouraging me to drink when what I could do with is him praising me for not drinking. I've tried speaking to him but he didn't really listen. I think it's a defence mechanism for him because deep down he knows I'm doing the right thing and he probably shouldn't be drinking either because of his health which isn't great. What should I do?

Technically today is the first day of October, but I managed to not drink yesterday.

Turns out, a drunk purchase I made over the weekend helped me yesterday. I can't even remember how it came up or where I ran across it, but I was reminded of the 1978 movie, *I Wanna Hold Your Hand*. It was Robert Zemeckis' directorial debut and he's my favorite director of all time. He did the *Back to the Future* trilogy, *Forrest Gump*, *Cast Away*, *The Polar Express*, and many, many more. The last time I saw *I Wanna Hold Your Hand* was years ago, but I remember really, really enjoying it. It's set in February 1964 when The Beatles came to America for the first time and performed on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" The plot is about a group of teenagers trying to get tickets for the show or trying to meet The Beatles.

Anyway, I was curious about whether or not it had ever been released on Blu-ray. I had the DVD from 2004, but I wanted to upgrade. I searched on Amazon and found that The Criterion Collection released it earlier this year with a brand new 4k transfer and new interviews with the cast and crew. Well, being as drunk as I was, I had it purchased less than 30 seconds of my knowing its existence.

I received it in the mail yesterday and was actually happy that my drunk ass bought it. Typically when I try to quit drinking I'm left bored out of my mind and this has led to me making special trips to buy more booze. Well, last night I decided to throw that movie into my PS4 and catch up with this old movie I hadn't seen in a while.

Best thing I could've done last night! It was just as good as I remembered it and I loved hearing all of the old Beatles songs from their earlier albums. I think the movie has about 16 or 17 songs of their's. It was just such a fun movie to watch that it really picked up my spirits. I forgot how much a good movie can do that.

Anyway, I'm rambling at this point. What I've discovered is that I need to find a way to keep myself occupied after I get home from work. I think I'm going to throw in a movie every day and it will allow me to unwind so I'm not thinking about drinking. I also have unfinished business with many video games I've never finished. And I'd like to get back to writing every day.",6

————

Today. Day 3. I feel l need to document this because I’ve been here so many times. Back to square one, back to rock bottom. Maybe this time I didn’t fall into my deepest, darkest, lowest yet (committing crimes, betraying those who love me, being my “most ashamed”), but I fell again. I spent a beautiful day at one of my favorite places (4 days ago now) with friends drunk, crying, depressed over things that are out of my control, things I lost, things I feel victimized by. I could’ve spent this day feeling light and happy, but instead I picked up the bottle- almost immediately upon waking up- and ruined my time. It wasn’t my worst day ever, but it is absolutely not how I want to spend any more of my life. I’ve been here so many times. I want this time to be different. I want to recognize my worth, create boundaries, understand that my path might not be everyone else’s, live my life presently, and stop telling myself that I deserve less. 

For so long I’ve accepted crumbs. I’ve been willing to take what was given to me and haven’t demanded more for myself. This has led me to a life of self loathing inside drink- endless, countless drinks. I’ve been scared to say “I don’t like this life” or “this doesn’t work for ME” because I have feared losing people who probably don’t deserve me in the first place. For a long time I tried to cry for help to my partner, the one who I thought would accept me and support me unconditionally. Instead of hearing me and saying “whatever you need, I’m here”, all I could get out of him was “you don’t have a problem, I’ve seen you down bottles of whiskey and be totally fine. And anyways, I want to be able to have a beer or cocktail with you if we want, I don’t want a sober partner”. While I’ve held a lot of resentment and sadness over this persons lack of willingness to be a supportive partner, I can’t blame him for being honest about what he wants, as much as it hurts to accept that I’m not it. He has plenty of his own addiction and codependency problems to work out, and those are not where I can place my energy. Since the painful process of exiting that relationship, I’ve sought out partners and friends who validate my problematic relationship with alcohol. I’ve spent countless hours with people who will drink in an unhealthy way with me, because I wanted to feel like there isn’t anything wrong with it, or my decision to center myself around this lifestyle. Spending time around fellow alcoholics confirms in my sick mind that it’s okay for me to live this way. And while I don’t judge these people for embracing that lifestyle (if taking shots at a dive bar til last call is your jam, go for it) but I’ve learned through far too many years of trial and infinite error that this is not the way for me. But I’ve allowed it because i want to follow the crowd. I’ve wanted companionship and have feared missing out on things that I’m realizing are so unimportant to me. This is why all these relationships have left me feeling empty. It isn’t because I’m unworthy of love or undesirable (although I can completely understand why no one would want to be around me in my depressed, drunken, jealous, nit picky, emotional state). It is because I have been presenting myself as a person who is undeserving of more. 

Although I can’t take back anything, I will try my hardest not to return to these places. Bar close is not calling to me, shots at work only to get in my car and drive are not calling to me. Day drinking til blackout is not calling to me. The hard moments are going to be in convincing myself that I can enjoy a cocktail with dinner or a glass of wine in a beautiful place. But I know what follows and I know where I spiral. 

Today I feel strong. I feel slightly more clearheaded. I feel the desire to make myself proud and not revert back to my natural tendencies. Tomorrow I may not. I live my life in an all-or-nothing way, and I hope to seek balance. Today is just today. Tomorrow is another day. As of now, while I feel inspired by my future and I have no desire to return to my past, I can’t look too far ahead or I’ll become overwhelmed. This is why I’m making a written record. I need to remember where I came from and why I’m doing this. Sober October is my current goal, and I know I can do this. I deserve to give myself this gift.",4

I don’t know what encouragement I should be lending myself, gentle nudge, hard ass, cheerleader, judge and jury. It’s difficult.  

But, for the first time ever, I’m going to give Sober October a run for its money. I don’t have any days of sobriety going into this, but have been drinking “moderately” (I know it’s an illusion but I haven’t been getting blackout so that’s good) for the last few weeks so, that’s a step in the right direction. 

Beer just held no allure for me last night, I wanted the escapism but I didn’t want to drink, and honestly hasn’t for a while. I’d not eaten all day, usually a recipe for failure, was drinking to get a buzz, to escape. I finally ate a huge delicious burger, and wised I’d paired it with a cold Diet Pepsi instead! 🥤

I totalled my September spending throughout the month of September and I spent approx $225 on beer. JFC! I have so many better more supportive things to be spending my money on.  So here’s to big burgers that I’ll spend my money on instead! 🍔

(Looking for advice...),"Just hung up the phone, it's for this Friday morning. My heart is pounding and my palms are sweaty, I'm doing this, this is happening!!!

Backstory, last year a family member confessed to sexually molesting me as a child. In response to this I completely destroyed my life with alcohol. 

Don't get me wrong, I've been a functioning alcoholic all of my adult life, and was dangerously close to falling apart anyway, but having my suspicions confirmed by the abuser himself, and in his own words, just really sent me into a complete tailspin. 

My biggest fear in starting therapy is a relapse, I'm worried that I'm going to be too overwhelmed with triggers and cravings... am I jeopardizing my sobriety by trying to address this?

Should I ask the therapist to go easy on the hard stuff early on? Is this rude and/or counter productive? 

Maybe just start with the alcohol addiction issues and then build up to it once we have established a rapport, that seems best.

Any advice offered would be greatly appreciated.

I own a little business with a male partner (I'm a 47 yo F) who is my best best friend (besides, of course, my wonderful husband).  He is kind of my life coach, and we discuss my struggle - which has been worse than my husband is aware since I mostly drink after he and the teenagers are in bed.  

Anyway, he is like the booze police.  When he knows I have had alcohol the night before he threatens to call my parents, my husband, break up the business, all that.  He's trying to help me.  He's a social drinker and utterly flummoxed by why I would drink on a school night.  

Anyway, here's what I'm grateful for.

I'm new to reddit. I joined up just so that I could finally have an anonymous place to discuss my drinking, and find ways to finally put an end to this battle. 

My story is just like a lot of ours...2 years ago, my wife left me and took full custody of my daughter because I was such a terrible drunk. I lost a great paying career, lost my wife, lost my daughter, houses cars you name it. All gone. 

I checked myself into rehab and moved back home to be around my family, who supported me getting sober. I was in residential treatment for 60 days, got out and stayed sober for about 47 more. 

After 107 days sober, I relapsed. No one knew. I wasnt honest about it with anyone. Not my sponsor, not my family, no one but God. Ever since that relapse, I'll go through periods of sobriety. I'll put 2 weeks together, and then get drunk one night. I live with my new girlfriend now, who also thinks I'm still sober. I'll buy just enough to catch a buzz, and toss the evidence.

Nothing dramatic has happened. In fact, my life is honestly amazing right now. My daughter is back in my life, and I'm going back to Missouri in 3 weeks to see her for the first time in almost 2 years. 

But....everyone thinks I'm sober. And its f*****g killing me inside that I'm not. I'm so tired of lying and hiding this crap. I, for the first time in 34 years, truly hate drinking. I drank last night after another 10 days of being sober. I'm sick of this crap. I dont want to fight it any more. I just dont want to drink ever again. Thanks for letting me share.",8

Here’s a few things...,"Fell asleep at 8:30 last night after a horrible day of anxiety and depression. I maybe woke up twice to readjust, but slept 14 hours. Wow I needed that. I’m still anxious in the morning but have lots to do. Workout, get prepped for a job interview tomorrow, and have a new rental property to renovate. I’m going to Barnes and Noble today to get the book “Idiot” by Laura Cleary. If you don’t know her look her up. She’s a comedian but has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse and has been clean for 7 years. I need a little comedy with my knowledge lol. 
Anyway, enough rambling. I had night sweats like crazy and I’m hoping with a good 45 minute cardio session and a little strength training, tonight will be even better. I’m gonna keep fighting the good fight. Also, I have the nomo app which is amazing because not only does it track your days clean, it shows how much money and how many hours you’ve saved since quitting. It’s unbelievable how fast that adds up. I hope everyone has a great day and for anyone on day one, fight as hard as you fucking can. You have to. It slowly gets better. Love all y’all. ❤️",2

I don't attend AA myself, yet have found a way to relate. In this struggle, the more people I can relate to the better my recovery. 

A huge impact on a main founder of AA was psychoanalyst Carl Jung. He was obsessed with the inner mind, unconscious, the shadow. It's fascinating work. Right before AA was founded Jung was said to influence the creation with a chance meeting. There is some more info out there on this... But. My point is Jung saw the collective unconscious as the higher power. Also a lot of more weird stuff. But the higher power is everything that you, and everyone else shares, collectively unconsciously. 

By surrending to the higher power, it is essentially what Jung circles refer to as an 'ego death'. Realizing you are your own thoughts, hence your actions, and working with them instead of supressing them we can find recovery (from everything). By not judging what our inner mind/soul/higher power is saying (surrender), we can analyze the thoughts and help guide/grow them for a better self.

My point with all this... Hopefully some science/spiritial people out there can find some community in AA. Not through attendance by any means, but it helped me accept some of the program's insights..",16

The concert was amazing but it was what happened after that that made me think. 

A drunk guy slammed into the back of our car getting out of the stadium. He had enough room to pull around us after I went to the side of the shoulder and he took off! I'm assuming he was drunk based on the running. It sucks because no one got a plate number and our insurance will have to deal with it. But the great news? I didn't have a drop of alcohol last night and we patiently waited for the cop to show up with no worry of getting in trouble at all. On a normal basis I would havd taken off with that guy.

I had been laid off, my relationship was done- I had no more fucks to give so I said fuck it and bought some beer.

Over the summer I started smoking again, continued to drink and this past week I drank nearly every day- a six pack of tall boys and two 100 proof shots.  That is the max I can drink without feeling like absolute shit the next day.

I am fat as fuck, I feel like shit most days, and I can't initiate the changes I need to make because of these bad drinking, smoking, and eating habits.  They are all intertwined.

I drank my last beers yesterday.

I have been drinking all my adult life (I am 31) and just navigating from one bottle to the other.

Luckily my alcoholism never got in the way of my job but I've ruined friendships and relationships due to it.

I do not want to feel pity and I do not want to be one of those who needs reassurance to change his life. However, I think sharing and recounting my experiences might be therapeutic. So I will list some of the worst things I have done due to alcohol abuse.

\- I crashed my car: New years eve a few years ago. I told my friends I would not drive home, that I was going to sleep in the car. I drove off and hit a wall.

\- I ruined my relationship: New years eve again. I went out with a couple of friends and my girlfriend (who I think is the love of my life to this day). I started mixing all kinds of booze (Rum, whiskey, beer, vodka...) and ended up throwing up and making a scene. Later I would puke again inside the taxi cab. She left me the next day...and I could never find anyone who even gets close.

\- I ruined my best friend's wedding: Again, this night is a blur really, but I know I got into a fist fight, left the party and my friends thought I was dead. I was found later in the morning by the cops roaming around in the middle of nowhere with no shirt and no shoes...

\- I was beat up by a group of people: After drinking too much at a local club I had a drunken argument with one of my best friends and left alone. Started shouting at some youths who proceeded to beat me up (broken ribs as a result).

The last one happened more than once (different places and occasions).

These are the worst I can recall and most of the stuff is a blur or was only retold to me by friends.

I put on about about 40lbs in the last couple of years. Many of my friends just stay clear of my. I have trouble maintaining a relationship because I'd rather be alone on the couch sipping on beer or wine. My work performance is mediocre to say the least. And I take little pleasure in things that would usually fill me with joy.

I have considered suicide due to the depression that set in. I will never do it though! I know life can get better and this is why I am committed to change and turn my life around.

Thanks for reading and let's hope I can go through with this.

Writing this with hopefully my last hangover in a while. 

Are there types of drinkers? I drink every day, I used to tell people I rarely get ""out of control"", but in the last two weeks I've drank to sickness twice, and made some very dangerous and stupid personal decisions.

I've tried many techniques to limit my drinking: left a job where we all drank a lot - taken up a fitness regime (if anything I started drinking more as a ""reward""), dated a tee-totaller (probably the only year in the last 15 that I didn't drink for long (4-5 day) periods.

I'm sure no one would be surprised if I told them I was quitting alcohol because I don't have a handle on it - people always mention how much I drink, but I almost feel scared saying it out loud.

I'm going to do Sober October, and I'm trying to tell people about it because from what I experienced starting a fitness regime, telling people about my intentions was helpful to keep it going.

I'd be interested in hearing or reading about the effects of stopping drinking high-ish volumes. I regularly drink 75 - 130 British units a week and I've been told I'll ""feel"" that.

Wish me luck.",5

2019-10-01 07:04:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dbrqv1/alcohol_and_our_relationships/,Alcohol and Our Relationships,"Over this past week I've been doing a lot of reflecting on the role of alcohol has had in my past relationships, and the damage it's done to them.

And while I still have a lot of reflecting to do, I have a basic outline.

There was girlfriend I was seeing and I'd go over her place for Sunday night family dinners. Really great family, loving, kind. I'd always leave by 7 or 730 though so that I could get to the liquor store to pick up my ration before it closed.

Then there was a girl I dated very seriously for a year and a half, we were talking about getting married, having kids, buying a house. We had our problems, but we were also drinking a lot. I honestly believe we would have ended up divorced in the end, but \*maybe\* if we, or I, hadn't been drinking so much it could have worked out a bit longer. I feel bad because my income was limited at the time (would have changed if we'd stayed together), and instead of helping out with my fair share of bills and costs, I bought alcohol for us.

Most recently I was dating a girl who was the love of my life. We broke up and got back together 4 times over the house of 20 something months. We got engaged. But my drinking got in the way of really listening to what she had to say, of hearing and acknowledging her fears around the future between us. Now she's moved on, and I'm learning to move on as well.

Most important of all, alcohol has gotten in the way of my relationship with myself. I used alcohol to cover up a hole in my Being that I didn't want to acknowledge, that I didn't want to confront and make better. I used to shove that Kid Me aside and ignore him instead of getting down on a knee and asking what's wrong and trying to help Him (Me) heal. I once went on a drunken rant to the last previously mentioned girlfriend, about a year ago give or take, about how everyone wears masks. She was shocked and appalled! She didn't wear a mask with me, how could I do that with her? Turns out I was wearing that mask not for her, she saw me clearly, but for me. So that I could look in the mirror and keep on keeping on going without confronting or addressing what I needed to. I didn't love myself, I only kinda-sorta liked myself. I had no pride even though I have lots to be proud of. 

Alcohol is insidious. It feels great, and ""helps"" us forget about our need for self-improvement. It helps numb the pain, old and new. Sometimes it feels like it fills in the void in our hearts, and in our souls, but it never actually does. It just makes it fester. I am now committed to making the changes I need to to be a happy, whole, and healthy person. Alcohol free. 

I invite you all to begin that journey with me. Without alcohol, and with a lot of courage, we can confront our demons, expel them, and build betters Selves, and better Lives.

Thank you.",5

But it's a bit misleading - it doesn't show the full picture. I think it comes up a lot because, as humans, we like to think ahead and plan.

The main reason this concept appears daunting, for me, is that it seems like I'll have to make a continued effort to stay sober. But that is not actually true at all. Sure, there may be a few occasions where I have to actually make an effort not to drink (particularly at the beginning, socially etc) - but these occasions will become fewer, easier and then eventually it will be so easy it will have become effortless. So, for the vast majority of the time, no effort is needed as I don't think about it most of the time.

There are also the occasional odd thoughts that I'm denying myself something good or fun - but I find these thoughts are easier to shoot down, as they are actually completely untrue and just a historical kind-of reflex thought. Drinking became the opposite of fun for me, it became a horrid burden, with nothing good or positive about it whatsover. Towards the end I could actually tell that I enjoyed it far less than I used to, and the trade-off the next day (or even up to a week) made it completely void of any merit.

When the thought of 'never drinking again ever' pops up, I tend to gently acknowledge the thought rather than suppress it (yes, learnt from meditation!) and remind myself of my favourite thoughts/mottos (these mottos are things that I remember and pop into my head daily):

**I'm free of it**

This is good as it feels effortless - I've moved on from it, it's just something I don't do any more. And 'not doing something' is pure effortlessness. It also has a cool double meaning - 1. my body being physically free of alcohol (with all the associated issues) and 2. I'm free of the burden, the mental gymnastics and have stepped out of the addiction cycle. This phrase, somehow, makes me feel good. It could even be shortened to simply 'I'm free'.

**I just feel so much better not drinking**

This is a good 'why aren't you drinking' response I read on SD recently - people don't tend to enquire further as it's completely true - people know that they'd probably feel better overall if they stopped. Personally, I feel the best ever (not always, but when I feel good I feel *really* good).

**I'm just done with it and want to do something different**

This seems to help neatly box up my drinking and put it in the past. It's something I used to do and now I do other, more rewarding things instead (for me my hobbies, family and exercise/running). This also removes any idea that I needed drinking in my life (nobody does) - there are plenty of other ways to relax/reward/invigorate myself (ahem, did I forget that alcohol didn't actually do that?), and socialising doesn't have to revolve around alcohol. Rather than losing something, I'm just doing something different.

This is actually something I read in an interview with guitarist Johnny Marr and really liked (source https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-2442644/Johnny-Marr-I-drinking-positive--radical-lifestyle-regular-rock-n-roller.html) along with his thoughts of not drinking being a positive thing which I've also appropriated for myself:

**I view not drinking as a positive thing**

Not drinking is definitely a positive thing: Feeling physically/mentally better. Getting time and energy for my family and hobbies. Not having to worry about my behaviour, spending excess money etc. The benefits are endless. This helps me see my non-drinking future, as a future of optimism, opportunities, happiness and joy. It also reminds me that drinking is the opposite of this completely.

Ultimately, I guess we're aiming for the circle to be complete so we can say, truthfully **I don't want to drink ever again - I don't like it** - I feel I'm slowly getting closer.

Thanks for reading, would love to hear your ideas on approaching the future. IWNDWYT.",9

2019-10-01 06:08:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dbr77o/book_movie_tuesday/,Book & Movie Tuesday,"Happy Tuesday Sobernauts! 

One last plug for Judith Grisel’s *Never Enough*! I found the chapter on alcohol simultaneously edifying, comforting, and depressing. She talks about all of the many things alcohol does to your brain (edifying), about why some of us are-- through no fault of our own-- so prone to get addicted to it (comforting), and about the massive damage it does on both an individual and a societal scale (depressing). It’s a big chapter. I’ll just hit a few highlights on the 3 aforementioned takeaways for me here.

* The alcohol molecule itself is much simpler than that of any other drug of abuse, which, perhaps counterintuitively, gives it more power than other drugs. “Molecules of cocaine, THC, heroin, and ecstasy are much larger and more structurally complex, and therefore their sites of action in the brain are very specific. Alcohol is so small and wily its actions are hard to pin down.” Alcohol *can* and *does* go into and interact with many types and locations of neural receptors. It does all kinds of crazy shit to our brains, y’all. It is one of the oldest known and best researched intoxicants on the planet and yet it is still about the least well understood because such a huge variety of chemical interactions are unleashed when it is introduced to your brain.What JG and others have used is the tool analogy: where most drugs have a small specific function like a screwdriver or pliers, alcohol is a sledgehammer that just damages everything in its path. My preferred analogy is that like other drugs are assassins slipping in to a country to do a bit of dirty business where alcohol is an invading army coming in by land, by sea, by air, and wreaking havoc all across the land. 

* “In addition to all of the classic neurotransmitter interactions just described, alcohol interacts with scores of peptides.” JG focuses on one of those many peptides, beta-endorphins, and calls out some research that shows “differences in the natural activity of beta-endorphin between those at high and those at low risk for excessive alcohol consumption . . . [this research] showed that high-risk individuals have about half as much beta-endorphin in their blood as those at low genetic risk . . . [and] alcohol was able to remedy this natural deficit especially in those who have a high risk for excessive drinking and, at higher doses, produces a surfeit of the peptide.” She goes on: “Because beta-endorphin contributes to a sense of well-being by soothing stress and facilitating social affiliation, those of us with naturally low levels may experience less sense of safety and connection, even as children, on a day to day basis.” And then we find that missing part of us in a glass of alcohol. I include this part at the expense of many other worthy insights in this chapter because it was a eureka for me. I have not had any tests on my beta-endorphins done or anything, but somehow when I read this part, I **knew** that this phenomenon was what was going on with me. You know how on reddit people read comments on posts that they feel completely sums up a good answer so they just comment back the word “this”? Well I read that part and thought “THIS”. THIS!!! 

* You all know about the damage alcohol inflicts on our bodies? Our minds? Our families? Our communities? No need for me to spell any of that out because then this post would be a behemoth wall o’ text. I’ll use another redditism for this point by using another quote as a TL;DR: “alcohol killed about twice as many people in 2016 as prescription opioids and heroin overdoses combined, and even this number would be almost 3 times higher if it included drunk-driving related deaths.”

This is my final post about this book. I have read a lot of quit lit and addiction books over the past 2 years and I got more out of this one by far than any other I’ve read. I hope some of the things I’ve mentioned resonate with you and will be helpful and I hope that you will consider adding it to your own quit lit shelf if you have the means to. I haven’t done it any justice in my little summaries. 

So SD, tell us what are you reading/watching/listening to (and yes, that absolutely includes music that is helping you).",11
2019-10-01 04:41:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dbqfee/couple_observations/,Couple observations,"Last night, I was at a work-related function with an open bar. The short version is that a drunk guy knocked over my NA Heineken and replaced it. I took a few pulls and thought it tasted different. Of course, then I look and see it's not NA. No problem, traded it in at the bar.
What I took away: I briefly thought people would notice the NA, though I didn't much care. I just don't want to have to explain it. But obviously, it wasn't obvious. 
Also, drunk behavior makes me exceedingly satisfied with my sobriety. That guy apologized and introduced himself 4 times. He spilt my beer while introducing himself in the first place. I think the tape gets stuck on repeat.

2019-10-01 04:17:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/dbq81j/my_boss_is_a_horrible_person/,My boss is a horrible person,"During our quarterly review today he just laid it on, criticising me fairly constantly for about 40 minutes even though I have a really good record. I joined his team somewhat reluctantly after deciding not to manage my own team anymore 6 months ago due to other work commitments, as the PM on the largest project at the company I gave that side of things up to focus on the project delivery.  He's 10 years my senior but we were at the same professional level before I gave up the team management, and now he  pulls me up for the smallest shit, I think he has a serious axe to grind.

After I questioned why he was criticising so much (he treats people like children he really fucking does), I  pointed out some of his mistakes which I fixed which were far more serious (impacting financially on the company) and the review just deteriorated.

I had a few days off months ago due to my high BP and stress caused by him, and he even came to my house to check up on me. WTF! Then, after telling him I didn't want him to talk to anybody about my health issues at the time, he talked about me to others in the office and openly made a joke about me having a stroke.

I brought that up during the review and then decided the meeting was over. I have since emailed HR and my old manager (his boss) requesting a meeting to discuss our working relationship. I will be bringing this all to their attention and moving teams.

The fucker almost had me reaching for the bottle. But then he would have won, and he isn't going to fucking win.

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I have a half day of client meetings which he will be part of, wish me luck fam!

EDIT

Thanks SD family for all the kind words and advice, you are the best! 

I have spoken to friends in the workplace and he has a lot of previous for this kind of stuff and several people have previously left his team by request. He moved departments to manage this team last year. I don't let him bully me and that's why we have conflict. He always has to be the big man and I think that's why he gets so pissed that I don't take his shit. 

I'll be insisting I move team and move forward from there. He has nothing to offer me as a manager so regardless I'll be finding a better person to work for.

I had done well staying sober during the autumn of last year, but toasting the New Year was a bad decision, and I stuck with that bad decision longer than I should have. 

I have never gotten a Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) nor even a Driving Under the Influence (DUI) citation, nor was I ever pulled over for a sobriety check, nor did I ever pass through one of those random road blocks where cops pull every driver to a stop “to check licenses” (but we all know they’re looking for ANY reason to write a ticket and thereby raise money for the local government) while under the “affluence of incohol.”  But it was probably only a matter of time.  

I quit not only because of that, but for health reasons, and because drinking was costing me $45-50 a week or as much as $200 a month. 

It ultimately comes down to that I just needed to get a better grip on my life. 

Now I have begun a program of reading and study to help sharpen my mind and improve myself. My goal is to be a better ‘me’ today than I was yesterday.
