Now I am one of the crucial team members that others count in. So much to the point my general manager in my review said he is keeping me in mind for leadership roles. 

The review started my supervisor was running late but the gm was on the phone and he said “well it’s just us now how have you been lately?” Told him about my kick ass quarantine beard that I am in a battle of wills with my wife. Told him about the kids and me gearing up to go hunt morel mushrooms this weekend. Had a pretty good chat for 15 minutes. Then my supervisor joined and we started. 

The meeting went over some mistakes I made on a busy day where all but myself had called in and I was alone doing 3 jobs. He didn’t give me grief about it just said I’m shocked this is all that went wrong these are small potatoes. 

He then asked me about an idea I have had to help streamline our processes and he told me “that is a great idea send me what you have so far in an official email so you will get credit for it.” I was excited my opinion actually mattered .

He then ended the meeting and said keep doing what you are doing we have no complaints and you are a joy to work with. A year ago this would never happened. Everyone was annoyed with me and they wanted nothing more than for me to resign. Now I’m being considered for leadership and I am on the path for advancement. I am so excited!

While those can be true, I started to think of the most fun people I know.  Sure, some of the laughs may have been when they were drunk, but likely at their expense.  It occurred to me that the “social idols” I imagine are the people themselves, not who they are when they drink.  

I probably have this idea in my head that I’m a smooth talkin’ fun boy because I’ve garnered a few laughs.. **while other people in the room are also drinking**.  The truth is I’m likely a slurry mess and slow to come up with a joke.  It just happens to be that drinking was the only social time I’d have because I’m quite introverted.  It makes sense that I would correlate the two and convince myself that I’m whimsical even though I’ve been caught off guard with “are you drunk..?”

Long story short, I envy the folk who are contagiously fun because that’s just who they are.  I’ll find my own comfort in fun without trying to be extroverted through alcohol",19,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45441347}"

I told myself that would be it and I wouldn’t buy any more tonight. 

3 hours later I’m back at the store for cat litter and buy a second one. On the way home I tell myself I’m only going to drink half of it. 

I get halfway through it and step outside for a cigarette (I’m trying to quit those too, unfortunately). I’m in that hopeless, self-hating state of mind where I’m both so ashamed for being here again and totally convinced that I’m just going to keep drinking and smoking tonight until I run out. 

But I made myself think about it. I literally talked out loud to myself about what my choices were. I played through the tape where I continue to secretly drink in the kitchen so my partner doesn’t know. And smoke a bunch more cigarettes alone because he isn’t drunk so he doesn’t want any. And feel paranoid and closed off and can’t be present because I’m too worried he’ll be able to tell I’ve been drinking. And have trouble sleeping and wake up in 3 hours and lay awake for another 4. And spend tomorrow morning feeling hungover and guilty.

And then I played through the tape where I stop now and cut my losses. And can sit on the couch next to him and not be completely preoccupied by when I can sneak another drink and have another cigarette. And go to bed after 4 glasses of wine instead of 6. And skip the drunk math where I try to figure out if I can get away with running to seven eleven at midnight to get more without it being suspicious. And maybe even read some of the book I told myself I wanted to read tonight. And actually keep my promise to myself that I’m only drinking half of the container.

And you know what? In that moment I was still convinced I was going to keep drinking. Even after all of that, it felt like it was inevitable. I couldn’t even tell myself I was going to stop. But what I *could* do was say I wasn’t going to have another drink for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, I’d revisit the decision.

I went inside, made myself a cup of tea, gave my cat his medicine and went to the bathroom. And then I stared at my toothbrush and asked myself if I was done tonight. It took about 5 minutes to decide, until I eventually realized if so was that hellbent on drinking, a clean mouth wasn’t going to stop me. But if I was on the fence it might. So I brushed my teeth.

First to those on their first day again. Keep working at it. The fact that you are trying shows that you want to do this. If you are wondering how i did it? It was by accident. Sort of. 

As i said its difficult, ive had many day 1's. A few years of day 1's.  Its frustrating. I have read that some people plan their last day of drinking, go full out and go to rehab the next day or on monday. This is sort of how it worked out for me. I was thinking about it just going full out, planning around a certain day and then cold turkey.

The thing is the night that it happened i didnt plan any of it.  I ran into some friends at a bar, one friend was having a mid life crisis and the other had to run off and get their partner. I stayed to drink with my buddy and we went into the night. Needless to say i woke up with one fucked up hangover. I was sitting on my bed thinking that this is how im going to die. By alcohol poisoning or liver failure, acute pancreatitis or some weird disorder.  That was when i made my decision. It was either that day or never. 

Yes its hard. Most/all my friends are drinkers. We all meet at the bar and talk and enjoy each others company. I just wasnt going anywhere going there. Yes it was fun. I was a regular, I was the bar, I was the liquor. It literally was my 2nd home.  I had warched the entire bar staff change out a couple of times. 

Drinking becomes the activity - Jim Norton.  It was something he said in an interview once I think he was on the JRE podcast. It really stuck with me becasue its true. I continued to drink because its how i got laid. You know take the edge off and things get easier. Yeah, turns out i like to drink more than i like to talk. Probably why i have been single for so long. Because id rather sink into the shell of the person that i am instead of enjoying actual company.

Anyways i see im wrtting a wall o text and im not sure what direction im going to take this conversation. But to those that still reset to day 1, dont be so hard on yourself. The fact that you are trying is good enough. Just keep a calendar and count your sober days. When you fall off the wagon use a different color pen/pencil/marker and mark that day off. Then at the end of the week month, year, average out how long you havent drank V drinking nights. Over time you will feel better about yourself.

Well, this time, my parents found out. And I got sick of who I was. I was house sitting for a friend and watching her dog--something I have no business doing because I couldn't watch myself. I am 29F and I just go dumped by the person who I thought was the one. Me + loneliness + depression + empty house of booze=BENDER OF THE CENTURY (bonus--I was even wasted at work on zoom with my camera off like a fucking idiot).

 I drank a half a handle of vodka, a million hard seltzers, super heavy beer, and a bottle of wine in... three days? My parents found me there curled in a ball sobbing shaking. They knew I needed help. I tried to white knuckle it DO NOT DO THIS. NEVER DO THIS. NEVER EVER DO THIS. THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS TO GET ATIVAN FROM A DOCTOR. Please do it. I was so afraid to do it. It was the best decision I have ever ever made. 

Within hours, 2.5 megadose of ativan made me feel human again. Before I felt human again, here is what I did: 

\-hot showers. just sit your ass down. sit the fuck down, lie the fuck down, let the water hit you as you breathe as deeply as possible. IF you can reach for soap, do your best to wash a little. crawl out. wrap up in a towel. crawl to a bed with a remote. 

\-WATCH ANYTHING. do not be in silence. I don't care if it's real housewives of wherever the fuck. 

\-get on this sub

\-water, ginger ale, gatorade.... NO ICE. drink it at room temp. set a timer to drink a big gulp of each rotating every 20 minutes. 

\-TELL SOMEONE. Most psychiatrists will immediately give you ativan. the ER will too. Who cares about judgment. This is the absolute only thing that will keep you from drinking again. Do not do the hare of the dog or try to taper. It could work but still, you want the discomfort to end. do whatever you need to do to get the ativan or the valium. With these medicines you will not seize, and in the US in my state with no insurance 30 days worth is $1.80.

\-once you have been able to sleep and rest on ativan a bit, eat: sourdough toast (has probiotics for the stomach) with a tiny bit of butter and salt (electrolytes) 

\-eat white rice

\-eat plain scrambled eggs if you can 

\-take a double dose of fish oil if you can get a full stomach 

\-take turmeric with black pepper vitamins 

\-take hair skin and nails vitamins (im sure youre have taken a beating like mine)

\-cancel work---like cancel it for two days--make up whatever COVID vaccine story you want 

\-did I mention sit your ass in front of a tv and get off social media? 

\-wrap yourself in a blanket like a burrito

\-take a bath

\-and finallly.. to get all the gross shit out of your body, I replaced my nightly cocktail habit (this was day 4 of detoxing) with 

""**Cranberry Drano""** 

Recipe: 

1 scoop of orange Metamucil Powder, 

1/2 cup of pure cranberry juice 

i splash of plain seltzer (if in the morning and your stomach can handle it, put in a bit of green tea) 

finish off with water and ice cubes and let that fibrous drink pull out all the bad shit that is stuck in your intestine and body. Repeat every night or every other night. Get that poison out of you. 

Replenish in the morning with gatorade, coconut water, or just regular water.

Earlier this week  I mentioned I would have a hard time with a whole extra day around a campfire and my spouse said something like ""the good thing about camping is you can't drink more than you bring."" The thought of drinking at all caused my anxiety to spike. I thought about it, I journaled about it, I talked with friends about it... and ultimately decided that I would either drink too much or be sad that I didn't pack more to drink. I decided not to drink. 

My spouse asked me to pick up  a six pack for him for the trip (he told me he wouldn't drink if I would prefer, but he doesn't get drunk and I never drank beer anyway, so I don't mind). After I put beer in my cart, I wandered to the hard cider and seltzer aisle. I lingered there. I wanted to see what was new since I quit shopping there four months ago. I didn't feel any cravings or desire to drink, but I did feel immense sadness. I'm happy with where I am compared to four months ago, but I'm sad that it has to be like this. I considered looking for alcohol free wine and then decided to stick with kombucha. 

At the checkout, I realized I didn't have my ID (in my state the grocery stores have a 100% ID policy). I have no idea where it is. I haven't needed it in 4 months. So, despite being in my late 30s, I was denied the beer that wasn't even for me. I'm legitimately anxious about my lost license - I hope one of my kids just stashed it somewhere strange and it turns up soon. But there was a time when this would have made me INCREDIBLY anxious because it would have limited my ability to buy alcohol. It would have affected my every day behavior.

He literally dedicates the book to all alcoholics and addicts who have the courage to face their demons. And it’s resonating in ways I didn’t expect.

I’ve always struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life and I take meds to keep it under control.

Now while I got that preface out of the way, I have to say that I KNOW drinking interferes with the effectiveness of my medications (specifically my antidepressant medications as I’m on very minimal anxiety ones-nearly tapered off of the anxiety ones) and when I wake up in the morning or - even worse at about 3 am because I have insomnia (not including the alcohol induced insomnia) and won’t be able to get back to sleep till 5 or 6.

I am NOT planning on acting on these things, and when I tell my hubby that I DONT feel comfortable with a gun in the house he takes me seriously.... and I KNOW logically this is a reaction to drinking nullifying my antidepressants.

I think every person that has/had a drinking problem knows what I'm about to talk about here, embarrassing maybe even inappropriate memories that have happened whilst extremely intoxicated.

My drinking nights of embarrassment include everything from public indecency to borderline sexual assault as well as just other slightly less criminal moments of embarrassments like flirting with my mate's girlfriend in front of his face etc (you get the idea). luckily I was never arrested, but I should have been. what I regret most though is that my friends (or indeed myself) always egged me on and never sat me down to say/see how much of a cunt I was being.

Anyway, I haven't got properly drunk for about six months now since by far my most embarrassing night but every so often I have ""depression days"" where I remember an embarrassing drunken memory that causes me to do nothing all day other than staying in bed self-loathing and literally feeling sick and thinking everyone hates me all over again. obviously, these days (that occur probably once a month at least) are awful and ruin my productivity and happiness so I was looking for advice from fellow ex-drinkers on how you've learnt to forget and specifically forgive yourself for disgraceful behaviour when drunk.

It’s gotten to a completely unmanageable stage where I’ve been suicidal due to my drinking and my family want to pay for me to stay in a rehabilitation centre, yikes, slippery slope doesn’t even cover it. 

Given the above pretty dire circumstances, dating might seem a petty or insignificant thing but it’s fair to say it’s my other unhealthy coping mechanism/crutch, low self esteem etc (massively attributed to drinking) and a lack of healthy coping mechanisms means that this is very high on my list of things I rely on to feel good about myself.

I wrote the below on day 3 and posted it elsewhere, but I want to repost it here instead of rewriting it since a lot of it remains true on Day 5. I'll add this: On Day 4 I felt a lot of temptation and struggle and that feeling of ""why am I even bothering with this crap?"" For a little bit all I wanted was a drink. I drank Ahas and decaf coffee instead.

Now it's Day 5, which is still hardly anything, and I feel better at the moment, but it's still the day. I usually feel fine in the day, but at night the struggle resumes. I'm reading The Naked Mind and it seems helpful. I'm working out a ton and distracting myself. But it sucks. So I'm posting this because it just helps to get it out there and to hear from others. It helps and we should ask for help when we need it, something many of us aren't very good at!

**Quitting booze.**

So, I'm approaching 40 and I've been drinking steadily since before I turned 21. I remember sneaking the liquor from my grandparents' cabinet at Christmas when I was fifteen and just downing enough of it straight out of the bottle until I got a buzz, which made family Christmas a lot more fun.

When I was in college I did a lot of drugs but then just kept drinking and gave the rest up (except for pot which I don't think is a problem drug for me--I just don't like it enough for it to be and honestly I wish I did because it's a lot healthier than booze).

Drinking picked up in my 30s, and then picked up a LOT over the pandemic. I am basically at a point where I have one drink, I may as well have 15 drinks. I know when to quit, I just don't care. I chase the buzz until I take it too far.

I don't get hangovers though I do get TIRED sometimes, like the wind is out of my sails all day \*until I have a drink\*. That's not always, just sometimes. Normally I can function just fine. I can drink every day and function just fine except...

* I don't do self-care stuff to the extent I should. Just lots of little self-care things fall by the wayside.
* I make excuses not to exercise or do other healthy things.
* I eat too much and not healthy stuff and often late at night. I can't lose weight if I'm drinking that's for sure.
* I forget things. I forget things my kids have told me. I forget to do things I said I would do. I find myself passing out on the couch.
* All these little things add up and make me feel like I've already lost the battle, so I drink.
* When I'm stressed I drink. When I'm sad I drink. When I'm happy I drink. When I want to go socialize I drink. The pandemic has made all of these tendencies more exaggerated.
* I'm the kind of drinker that doesn't like the night to end. People drink more when they're around me. I don't mean for them to, but it's what happens.

A few months ago I stopped drinking for three weeks and felt pretty good. But the temptation was strong and so I decided hey, why not? I've done three weeks. I'll have a drinking night and then wait a month before I do it again. I'll drink 12 times a year this way. My one cheat night a month.

Then I drank most every night for the next few months with only brief hiatuses here and there. I think if I could drink one night a month I'd do that, but I don't think I can. Is it all or nothing?

I'm at a point where one part of my brain says: You just need how to drink moderately / have a schedule / drink once a week or once a month; and the other part of my brain says: Quit lying to yourself, if you pick up the bottle again you'll be back on a permanent bender in no time. I think that part of my brain is smarter. The other part of my brain is more convincing.

Three days isn't anything, I realize, but I aim to make it much longer. That's the plan, I think.

I'm having this internal war. I want to say ""three days will become three months will become three years will become three decades"" but another voice says ""what about on your 40th birthday? What about on your next vacation or camping trip? You seriously aren't going to drink?"" And that part of me is laughing hysterically at the sheer arrogance of it all. ""Yeah right, dude. You'll rationalize it somehow. You'll make some sort of ""plan"" and then toss it out the window because once you start drinking again you'll say ""fuck it"" because you already fucked up and defeatism and old habits will rush in.""

This is not a position I really ever thought I'd be in. Drinking has always been fun for me. I'm a fun drunk. I never get angry. I never make stupid choices other than drinking too much and eating too much (and smoking too much, since I'm that kind of smoker-who-only-smokes-when-drinking-then-drinks-all-the-time). I don't get angry, I don't get in fights, I don't miss work or fail to meet obligations. It's more insidious the way this impacts my life. Bad sleep, bags under my eyes, weight gain, feelings of self-loathing over it all that really live in my subconscious and gnaw at me.

I'm not sure how this war will end, to be quite honest. Right now, only three days in, I think my sober brain can win. I think so. I want it to. But that other side, that deeply convincing side, the one that I've spent so much time with getting wasted together, that side has power, too. Everybody drinks, that side tells me, all your friends.

I think a big part of my fear over all of this is missing out. That's stupid, I know. But missing out on the fun side of drinking. Going out with friends. Drinking on vacation on the beach or at a pub. It sucks. I wish I'd never let it get out of hand like this. I'm not sure that I'm looking for advice so much as just writing it all down so that I can help process my feelings. It sucks. The whole thing just really sucks.

It’s my first time posting here, I saw a lot of support and it encouraged me to give it a shot. I’ve been drinking since i was a teen, and I always exaggerated, blacked out, embarrassed myself, all these things. I just couldn’t control it, but i didn’t know it was growing to be a problem.

Now, 9 drinking years later i have a girlfriend, who i put through a lot because of this. I stopped for some time, to relieve her of the suffering, but I eventually got back and now i’ve been lying to her, and doing it behind her back. I really don’t know how to tell her anymore, it’s been several relapses and it’s way beyond forgiveness. The thing is, she lives with me, so my brain knows I can’t do it with her around and i simply don’t feel the urge to drink during these days.

I don’t understand, I can go a lot of time without it and i don’t even miss it, but EVERY TIME i get the chance when she leaves, i drink a lot, no matter how hard i try to convince myself not to, i fail every time. Now the same thing is happening to smoking, which was an addiction i dropped for several months. Every time she leaves, I drink, i smoke, i lie.

Today it’s the day after a drinking day. I really thought i would be able to stay sober last night, but i failed again. I’ve been having anxiety and guilt all day, guess it’s the best day to do something about this.

I heard it years ago, and I have never forgotten it.  I'm surprised I have never heard it again.  I thought it might stick with someone else in a helpful kind of way, so here's the story:  

Several years ago my husband and I were attending a social function here in Hawaii.  It's common to rent out a hall of some sort for graduation parties, etc.  I think that's what we were there for.  My husband was performing with the band.  There are always long rows of cafeteria style tables and food is served.  Lights are bright, and it's not exactly a party scene.  It's generally a BYOB type of thing.  A few people seem to bring it along, and we always fell into the group that brought plenty.  I, especially drank heavily at these types of events, largely intensified by social anxiety, not really knowing anyone, and not really feeling like I belonged there in the first place.  I guess that social anxiety is a challenge I still need to face directly, now that I'm working toward more and more sober days.  And now that the world might once again be social as Covid releases it's grip on our lives.  

&#x200B;

On this occasion as I was getting another beer out of our giant trusty cooler bag (we must have brought at least a dozen for the two of us, and that was just for the few hours we'd be there), I looked over and smiled at the older guy sitting a few chairs down.  Held up a beer and offered it to him.  He smiled so kindly, and said ""No thanks.  One drink - one drunk"".  I understood of course, and gave him the old thumbs up.  Thought to myself 'I get it.  This guy's got a problem and he knows his limitations.  He can't just have one.  Maybe he's been through AA or something.  Good for him.'   Now this was back in the day when I was so completely oblivious to myself and my relationship with alcohol.  Because the truth is that I too was ""One drink, One drunk"" at the time.  I just didn't know it, or just didn't know it was a problem.  I would never stop at one, I would never stop at four.  I would start drinking, and keep drinking.  We'd drink all the beers we brought, and we'd go home and drink some more, and pass out.  And that was what we did.  I don't know why I thought I was so different from him.  But it has really taken me many many years to open my eyes and see that my behavior is not healthy, and not okay.  I don't want to get drunk.  I don't want to black out.  I don't want to drive drunk.  I don't want the alcohol to decide for me that I need another.  Truth is, I'm that guy, or at least, I hope to be someday.  For many years, I just haven't had the courage and honestly to make that commitment for myself.  And I guess I have to look forward to the day that when someone offers me alcohol, I can confidently say, ""no thanks.  One drink, one drunk"".  I'm not ashamed of it anymore.  And I don't divide people up in groups of alcoholics, and not alcoholics.  Now I see it differently:  People who alcohol has already taken a stronghold on, and people who it hasn't - yet.  But now I understand it's just a matter of time for anyone using alcohol frequently.  It will get you.  It will be your decider.  Only you might not see it, because you don't think you fit the ""alcoholic"" profile.

Anyway, that's my share.  You guys are the best, and I spend each night and each morning reading and absorbing and learning to be honest with myself and gathering tools to fight this poisonous beast for the long haul.  I don't think I will be perfect at it.  At this point, I don't count days sober in a row - I count days sober in a week, or a month.  And every day I add to that side of the equation feels like a step in the right direction.",72,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.51350874}"

On Christmas Day, when I was 9 years old, my stepdad and mom said they wanted to talk to me about something. I was sitting in their bed. My stepdad got up and walked into his home office, came back with a big stack of papers, and threw them into my lap. He pointed and tapped at the papers really hard and said “do you know what these are?” I said no. He looked really angry so I was nervous. Then he said “these are adoption papers, do you know what that means?” I said no, idk if he heard me though because I was nervous and I said no really quiet. He said “this means from now on you call me dad. If I ever hear you using my name to address me again I will ignore you.”

From then on I called him dad, when I would bring it up even years later they acted like they didn’t know what I was talking about. It really fucked with me.

I was talking with my mom about how my dad never let me put oatmeal on my toast and she said “I remember when he forced you to call him dad.” I stared at that message for a long time. She’s finally admitting this happened, I should be happy. I am happy that she is giving me validation. 

But I am also angry. So I’m not crazy? You actually fully lied to me for all these years? I’m fucking 30 now, I have my own child, and you’re telling me this 21 years later??

THE SEVEN TENETS

1. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.

2. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.

3. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.

4. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own. 

5. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.

6. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.

7. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.

Here are the suggested Seven Rituals that we have found helpful to achieve and maintain sobriety. 

THE SEVEN RITUALS

1. In our suffering, we had a moment of clarity. We realized that we had lost ourselves and recognized addiction as our adversary.

2. We decided our will and authority over ourselves would be reborn through adopting a new way of life. 

3. We made a commitment to take responsibility for our own actions in the past, present, and future, focusing only on what we could control.

4. We acknowledged behaviors and patterns of thinking that we found to be unacceptable or unhealthy.

5. Upon acknowledging these facets of ourselves, we began the practice of 
continual introspection and mindfulness.

6. We continuously strive towards self-actualization, seeking knowledge on our path to act &amp; respond ethically &amp; responsibly in all things.

7. After following this path, we recognized our own self growth and sought to point the way to those who are suffering. Heal Thyself, Hail Thyself.

We feel that our approach to addiction is completely realistic. We believe that addiction has become the arbitrary authority in our lives and by practicing The Seven Tenets we can overcome them together. The sooner we take a stance against this adversary the sooner we can achieve our true potential.",42,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.7079996}"

I am finishing school this month and I already have a great job lined up in a new city. I’m excited about my career and my future for the first time in a long time. And I’ve found some level of peace with who I am and how I’ve gotten here. 
I have 2 thanks to give for the success I’ve had. This community has been outstanding, and I know I would not be here today without you. I read posts every day and try to contribute often. I wouldn’t have taken the first steps without your guidance and support, and your stories and advice continue to keep me humbled and grounded in my sobriety. I will forever be grateful for you. 
I also have to thank my puppy. One week into my sobriety I got an 8 week old golden retriever who has been by my side throughout this journey. Caring for him has given me purpose and another reason to stay sober. I’d do anything for this puppy. 

I chose to mark my first 6 months of sobriety with a tattoo, illustrated by my sister.

Its been awhile since I've posted on here, so this is my backstory. Currently, I'm approaching my 9 month milestone. Going alcohol free has been the best decision I've made in my life. Since, I've been sober I've realized so many positive progressions. Mentally, I'm the strongest I've been. My overall cognitive skills have vastly improved along with my coping skills, temperament and anxiety. Physically, I've also had amazing gains. I've lost 25 lbs while building muscle from a daily workout, and nutritional regiment. I'm really happy with the progress I've made and the person I see in the mirror . So what's the problem?

I've been able to do this because I have not been employed the entire time of my sobriety. I lost my job at the beginning the of pandemic last April and after taking the first three months to nearly drink myself to death during the lockdown I stopped cold turkey. I was fortunate enough to have enough savings along with the unemployed assistance to focus 100% on myself and my sobriety without any outside stress triggers. Rent and all other bills could be paid on time and the money I used to spend on alcohol was traded off for healthy fresh foods.

Now, as things are relaxing and the weather is changing I feel like its time to get back out there. So on Tuesday morning I applied for a position in the field of work I did before. Yesterday morning I received an a email saying they have reviewed my resume and would like to proceed to the next step if I was still interested. My first thought after reading that email? ""OH SHIT""

It took me like 30 minutes to decide how to reply or if I should reply at all. I replied back that I was still interested in the position. I received a reply this morning asking if I was available to come in this afternoon for a formal interview. Although, of course I have no real commitments for the day I lied and said that I wasn't available today but tomorrow I would be available to which he emailed back almost instantly. ""Let's do 10am tomorrow"".

I've been on that side of the hiring table and know that his reactions are the same I would have if I thought I've found the right candidate. Not to sound egotistical but I'm aware that I present myself well and I there has never been an interview I've gone into that I wasn't offer the position. Unless, I have some sort of unforeseen meltdown I'm confident I'll be offered this position. The compensation would be great, making more money than I was at my previous job however it is in the same field of work as before which is a high pressure field that comes with stress. There wasn't a night I didn't have 6-10 beers to ""decompress"" after a days work. 

That being said, I do feel like I'm equipped with the tools and mindset to reduce and cope with the stress. However, there is that voice in the back of my mind that is saying ""what if your not?"" My job was a HUGE triggger/factor in my excessive drinking and I feel like I may be playing with fire here. Its not a job where alcohol is available its a job that the high pressure of the day leads many in the field to drink to relax at night.

But it's time right? It's time to put myself back out there and show the world the badass I've become. To take the next step in my comeback story. Bad damn if I'm not hesitant or dare say...scared to do it. 

Sorry for the long post but I needed to write this out. This is an inflection point in my journey and I feel like I should document it.

I would stop, always for a couple of weeks, and think I was good. That I had a ""handle"" on drinking, but could moderate. So why did moderation never work? Well because what I wanted was not moderation. At the time when I thought moderation was possible moderation meant that I could only drink once a week, maybe once every two weeks, hell perhaps maybe once a month right? No big deal? However, that ""moderation"" even in my head meant getting blitzed. Not just a few(2-3), but more like 15+. Only once a month couldn't hurt right? I'm an alcoholic so any amount is playing with fire, but allowing myself to say ""I can get really drunk once a month."" allowed me to easily justify getting drunk and think well this is for the month or week or whatever. It was always a lie I ate up. 

I need to do the work on my mind to maintain sobriety. It is easier everyday because of the clarity I have gained as a result. The best thing about my sobriety is that what I believed seems to be ringing true. I was a good man doing bad things. However, I knew I was a bad person when I drank so allowing myself to drink made me a bad person. Now I do not drink and I am able to be who I am supposed to be. 

The people around me are better, life is better, but you have to do the work. You have to treat the bigger issues in life or it won't get better, and for a very long time it will suck. It still sucks. I still want to drink all the time. I just finally understand I want to be alive more. I want to have a family and friends that respect me. I want to respect me.

I will make this summation quick. First started my issues in 2000 or so. Was able to stop in 2003, but I relapsed in 2015. Took me some time to stop again as I would have months to a year of sobriety and then go back. Been sober since 2019 now. Feels longer than the numbers show.

Now here's the sidebar questions. I haven't had burning desires or wants to drink. The thought has hit me, but I can get passed it.

However, there are things I can't seem to do. Every since I started drinking in 2000 it has ruined up my sleep patterns. I have the hardest time sleeping and waking up on time.  I have done sleep studies, talked to doctors, and been on long lists of sleep medications.

As a side note here, the things people report doing on Ambien, I do when I take nothing. I am a sleep walker/eater and I have been before and after I started drinking. The technical term is NSRED.

So to those of you stopping drinking or who have time under your belt - it's hard. It's one of the hardest damn things you can do in life. If you are doing it. Good. Celebrate your success.

I am not sure I celebrate enough personally.

Why the F can I stop drinking, but I can't correct my sleep patterns?

Conversely, I also have a hard time getting off of sugar. No luck there yet.

So, my two questions are - how do I stop sugar and correct my sleep? Any tips?

Just checking in today. It's about 9am and I'm feeling a little bit better today. I found myself making amends yesterday to some of the people I've hurt when I was drinking. It's amazing how much of the weight, the anxiety and the pain can be lifted with a simple apology. It still does not change what I've done and does not justify what I've done but man does it feel good to be honest with myself and others for a change.

I'm going to start reading the big book tonight. I've started Russell Brand's book on addiction and really enjoy his take on addiction and what it means to be addicted.

I still have much on my mind. My relationship is still very rocky. My partner has given me a tough choice. 

My best friend and I have been friends for eight years. I've watched him grow up. We drank together. We've traveled together. We've also done things we're not very proud of together. We've been unfaithful. Lied to our partners. 

He has the ability to drink alcohol. I cannot. It's something that he cannot grasp because he might not be an addict and I am. 

When I had my epiphany, he had the opportunity to be a good friend and keep me from losing everything. He let me drive. This is not the first time he's had the opportunity to be a good influence and a good friend and he has not done so. There is no doubt that he is not a good influence for me. However, when I told him of my journey he was completely supportive EXCEPT for one little line. He said, ""maybe in five years things will change.""

I am supposed to be the best man in his wedding and now I question that. There is no doubt that he is not a good influence for me and could jeopardize my sobriety.

My partner has given me an ultimatum it seems. She feels that she cannot continue to be with me as long as I am friends with him.

So in a nutshell, I have to choose. What do you guys think I should do?

A little less than year ago my anxiety just reached a point where it was unmanageable, so I tried having a drink to take the edge off. 

I drink almost every evening now. I just drink whatever amount it takes for me to feel okay (which I don’t think is anywhere near enough to qualify as Alcohol Use Disorder, since I have very low tolerance and get sick quite easily). “Feeling okay” to me means reaching a comfortable buzz, where I’m able to just relax and not think about anything. I don’t think I have a drinking problem, but there are some things that have been worrying me:

1) I am afraid I am jeopardizing my partner’s sobriety. He has been sober for 6 years (we’ve been together for 5) and he is studying to become an addictions counselor. I’m so proud of him. I never bring alcohol into our house and I never drink around him (not only out of respect, but also because I don’t like drinking in the presence of other people) but I’m concerned that if I eventually develop a drinking problem he may relapse because of me. This also means that I have to spend increasingly long stretches of time outside/somewhere else so I can drink, and finding somewhere I can drink in private takes an amount of effort I’ve been having difficulty keeping up with. 
2) It now takes a lot more alcohol to make me feel okay compared to a few months ago, which means I am going to work hungover basically every day. 
3) My buzz is becoming increasingly delicate, to the point where I will avoid doing things that may kill that buzz, like eating after I drink, or mixing alcohol with non-alcoholic drinks. I think I might have developed a whole ritual around drinking. This is an issue because sometimes things will come up (like a my partner and I will get invited to dinner or something like that) and I won’t want to go because I know that it will kill my buzz, but I also know that I won’t be able to drink more later because it will make me too sick. 
4) It’s been taking too much effort to keep a drinking routine. I look forward to going home in the evening and having a couple drinks. I make sure that I always have access to alcohol (I have family near by, so I can hide my alcohol in their house). Anytime I buy alcohol I buy a lot of it so there’s no risk of running out. I come up with strategies to drink less so that my alcohol lasts longer (like mixing Everclear 190 in my drink, or eating less during the day so that in the evening I can get buzzed faster with fewer drinks). It’s just taking too much energy to keep up. That said, I’m not sure if taking a break is an option for me because I just can’t cope with the way I feel on evenings I don’t drink. The anxiety is torture. A couple days ago I got home from work late and I couldn’t make the “drinking ritual” work (it was too late to find somewhere private, and I had to go to sleep soon because I had to go to work early the next morning), and the anxiety was too painful. 

I don’t think I have a drinking problem. I’m very familiar with my partner’s battle with alcohol abuse, and what I experience is nowhere even close to what he went through. He used to drink until he blacked out, and wake up with dozens of bottles of alcohol on the floor. I only drink until I feel okay, which takes the at maximum maybe 2 glasses of rum mixed with a shot or 2 of Everclear, depending on the night. He drank regularly for 10 years (with very small breaks where he would attempt to get sober). I’ve been drinking for less than a year. At one point he even drank in the morning. I only drink in the evenings. We’ve talked about this, and he doesn’t think I have a drinking problem, and I don’t think I know anyone who knows about this subject better than he does, so I trust his judgment. 

I’m kind of stuck in a difficult position where I don’t want to be dramatic (especially since I know what true alcohol abuse looks like), but I also feel that I need outside input in case I’m in denial (but I am embarrassed to tell my partner the full scope of what I’m dealing with). 

So, TL;DR: How can one know whether or not they have Alcohol Use Disorder/have a drinking problem?

Edit: I’m so sorry about using the term “alcoholism” instead of “alcohol abuse”. I learned the correct term from my partner, so I should have remembered to use it. It totally escaped my mind. I’m really sorry about that. I edited the post to fix it.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43640625}"

Posting today to remind myself that I am stronger than everything my Thursday is going to come toss at me. I have two therapy sessions in one day, which isn't wise but it just happened and I didn't fight it and ask for one of them to be moved. I probably will after today now that I am saying this aloud. One personal and one couples session. I always feel so drained after therapy and just honestly sad. The next day I feel a lot better, but just the act of admitting things to someone that you really wouldn't say otherwise just makes me drained afterwards.

I am gaining control over my life, despite it still being a little out of reach. I'm happy with what I've accomplished in terms of sobriety and moving away from alcohol as my primary coping mechanism to numb out from my life. I am here and facing it all head on. It's not a great experience, to be honest. But knowing that I'm actually trying my best everyday is the only thing helping me through. Sounds cliche. I can only thank sobriety for this second chance. And I suppose thank myself for choosing sobriety daily and doing the recovery work so that I can say no to alcohol.

Yesterday I caused enough damage to have to take a breathalyzer and drug test. 3 weeks ago, I would not have passed from excessive drinking on work nights. However, making the decision to cut out alcohol led me to blow 0.00 and be able to continue working. 

My company knows accidents happen all the time. If I had not reported the damage because I was scared to take a breathalyzer, I would have lost my job. If I had blown any amount of alcohol, I would have been fired. 

Instead, I reported the damage, passed the drug and alcohol tests, and returned to work an hour later. 

Some people can drink a normal amount. Maybe a beer or glass of wine with dinner, and call it quits. I could not do that. My drinking led me to be hungover at work constantly, possibly even partially inebriated still. 

I am so thankful for Sobriety right now. IWNDWYT.

Tl;Dr I had to perform a breathalyzer at work after an accident, and passed and kept my job!

Our neighbour celebrated her birthday yesterday and her boyfriend was pouring champage for all 5 of the adults in the room. He poured me a glass before I could say no.

I had the tiniest sip when we toasted the birthday girl, but other than that, I stuck to sparkling water the whole night as my new poison of choice.

There were two weird things for me, though:

1) It's been 7 months since my last drink. I swear I could feel the effect of literally wetting my lips with the drink. It was quite scary, to be honest. I did not want to feel like that - I do not want to feel like that.

2) Initially, I was embarrassed to say I don't drink. I don't know why - it's not like I'm making an arse of myself when I'm sober. But it took my wife pulling me aside to remind me that it's okay to say that you don't drink, without any further explanation. Every so often, I am reminded why I love her.

So that's it - I experienced fear at the thought of losing control again, and I felt shame in admitting to sobriety. Neither of those was warranted. I just thought I'd share this with you all.

I played my first concert there. I met my wife there. I damn near lived next door for a year. It honestly filled a gap of community that I truly needed after graduating college. It's where I grew up in a lot of ways. 

It clearly set me up for a decade of a problematic relationship with alcohol, but I can't fully separate the good from the bad. It was a place that accepted EVERYONE and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Sure if you're an asshole you'd be banned, but having face tattoos and just hopping of a train was not immediately disqualifying. 

But honestly, it has no place in my life anymore. I no longer live in the town, I no longer drink at all, and I no longer need a venue that will let 'any shitty band' play at it without asking questions. 

I don't know what the point of this rant is exactly, I guess it just feels like an end of an era. I'm sure they ruined many peoples lives with their 50 cent PBRs for the homies, but at that phase of my life it was exactly what I needed. 

I guess the conclusion is all things change, and the only path forward now does not involve chugging cheap beer to try to form human relationships.

It’s been great, but difficult because my boyfriend of 8 years, who I live with, is a heavy drinker. Whenever he drinks (maybe 2-4 nights a week) he cycles through a predictable roller coaster of emotional highs and lows that, once we’re home alone, usually devolves into a dark, hostile place where he’ll needle me for mistakes I’ve made in the past (most of which are actually not even true, but he doesn’t believe me). When he’s drunk and tries to pick a fight I just listen and don’t say anything because I know the next morning he won’t remember the conversation anyway, so normally he just rants for maybe 20 minutes and then he passes out in front of the TV.

Last night we went out and had a nice time, but of course he got drunk (by the way, he drinks 3x more than anyone else), and at home his “needling” crossed the line to what I’d consider abuse. He threw a lighter at me, slammed a beer on the table, yelled, called me a liar and a whore and worse, said we’re done and demanded I get the fuck out. He wouldn’t relent until I left our apartment after about 1 am. I didn’t go far, just downstairs to sit in our building’s laundry room for about 15 minutes until he texted to come home, which I did, and I slept on the couch. I didn’t really have anywhere else to go on that short of a notice.

He’s sleeping now but I’m looking for apartments online. We have complicated financial dynamics (basically I have a lot of debt because he didn’t have an income for a few years, but now he does, and I recently lost my job, so I was counting on his help ... part of me suspects he’s getting more bullish about me leaving now that I’m not supporting him). But if I get a cheap place I can manage, and can get some help from family if I’m really in a bind. My plan is to tell him this morning that I’m spending this afternoon looking for another place to live, and if he protests my condition to stay will be that he 100% quits drinking. When he’s sober the relationship is good, but obviously that’s not much consolation when I’m being thrown out of my apartment in the middle of the night.

I get my coffee, say thanks and leave, I look back and they're all watching, and they all wave and say a massively friendly goodbye. I'm not George Clooney or nothing, but that kind of attention was pretty regular back in my 20s. Brought back memories. I got to my car, looked in the mirror, thinking I've got a third ear growing out of my forehead. No, nothing. I noticed my eyes were a really bright color. 

I don't know for sure, maybe the Covid face mask is highlighting my eyes more than before, but I notice the eye color change also.

A little background on me; I'm happy to announce that I'm 3 days sober, yay! Not much but announcing my little accomplishment to you all helps me feel the need to keep myself accountable. I've had a problem with overdrinking and binge drinking for the last several years. I've made horrible decisions, don't remember much of my moments with my kids when I should have definitely put them first. I guess my bring drunk made me feel comfortable to be around peoole whenever there was a function happening. 

But this past Sunday I put my foot down and decided enough is enough. I can't be a slave to alcohol anymore, there has to be a better way! There's so much life to live and why should I live it drunk when I won't even remember it? 

I looked within myself and realized I may have a slight self-esteem issue which caused me to always feel the need to be drunk in public? I would go to the gym after a few shots just to take the edge off the anxiety of being judged. Stupid right?! All my past days are a blur. I'd get anxious about upcoming events that I were invited to attend and immediately thought to myself ""I better show up drunk just to feel comfortable."" It was getting old and I'm over it.

I guess the first step is accepting that you have a problem? Or admitting and acknowledging that you have a problem? Then go on from there like ok, I have a problem. Now what am I going to do about it? 

I'm grateful for this community and that I can share without being judged as I will not judge any of you but rather celebrate your accomplishments.

2021-04-29 03:22:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/n0z3w6/seeing_my_past_self_in_others/,Seeing my past self in others,"It has been a difficult couple of weeks but it does show me how much I have changed.

I moved out of a house away from an heavily drinking roommate and live distanced from that behavior for the first time in my adult life. When I was a child my mother was drunk every day. When I was on my own I was drunk or my friends were. My teenage years included very little processing of what was happening and mostly shoring up angst and depression. Since I was 17 I lived with many strangers and was always either drunk, stoned or both. Whenever I started to get in trouble, I would move where no one knew me. I had a couple relationships where I was exposed and if they didn't end it then I did.

One big change with this move is that I'm not in a house of binge drinking. Another change is that I'm not running from anything or moving so I can keep drinking. This move  is intentional, with my personal growth in mind and it's aligned with my longer term goals of exploring new employment options and having more flexibility so I can move from here quickly for work if I need to.

A difficulty I'm having now is dealing with the roommate's erratic behavior. Since I announced my departure, the drinking has increased. If the behavior was not a clear sign, I can see the bottles piling up as I pick up my stuff. I have only spoken about drinking with this person when they say the magic words, ""I keep drinking and it's not helping."" Then I offer that I felt similarly and talk about what I changed and how it helped. It's been several months since that type of conversation. Most of the time, when he brings up alcohol he talks about how valuable it is socially or how he's going to maintain drinking just the right amount and be happy. I perceive that as denial but I don't want to start a fight so I change the subject or go to another room.

Now he is perceiving my leaving as a personal attack and is increasingly paranoid. Today our interactions escalated today from non-communicative anger to calling me at work to threaten demanding payment, then setting a couple boundaries to control my behavior when I am at our shared property. The difficulty I am having with maintaining contact as we finish out our financial ties over the next month is that he is assuming bad intent and saying disrespectful things.

After a text message from him that made my blood boil, I cooled off and responded that I want to talk in person. I agreed to meet over the weekend. I want this conversation to be clear headed from both sides so I might have to set the boundary of no drinking mid-conversation. Every other time we have talked about stressful matters the shots have been flowing. I want to keep it simple. I want to say I feel disrespected by the assumptions of bad intent. If it comes up, I want to talk about how I am seeking a sober living environment. There has been no reason to mention that so far, I just decided to move and I started moving. I don't want any attacks either direction, nothing personal about it, there are just behaviors that I do not want to be around. I know he feels extremely vulnerable and I want to be somewhat graceful to smooth out the last part of our business together. But I am talking about an active alcoholic with a history of anger/emotional management issues. He wants control, and he can't have it in the way he wants.

When I think about it, the behaviors that he exhibits are very similar to mine in the past. They are similar to several others I know today, and remind me of a couple people 6 months ago who have since slowed down or stopped their drinking. It's just what alcohol does to some people. When I have been in denial, I thought I was the special one who processed alcohol like a superhero compared to everyone else. I thought I was finding myself in alcohol, and  I just acted out of character sometimes on accident.

When we first talked about my move, he shared his options. One was a couch at the house where I hear about increasingly violent events at parties and every morning after he says he should not have driven home that drunk. The next was a coworker's house, but that might not work ""because he's drinking less these days."" It was like watching myself from the past in a mirror telling me how the first priority is to be able to drink without being bothered about it.

All of these conversations and experiences tell me I am on the right path. The only reason I can treat someone with dignity while they attack me is because of sobriety. I am more of my true self when I don't react in anger. It's all part of the plan.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49681613}"

2021-04-29 01:35:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/n0xph1/42214/,4.22.14,"I started drinking when I was 15, and I fucking loved it. I completely blacked out that first night (and pretty much every night after), but that didn’t bother me at all. Honestly, I thought that most people blacked out all the time. It wasn’t until I got sober that I realized it was not normal. Even other alcoholics in the meetings I went to didn’t constantly blackout…but I guess when you’re in love with something like alcohol, you tend to let the consequences slide. When you are in love with alcohol, you let everything slide.

From then on, I drank as much as I could. I was 100% an alcoholic drinker from the start. Still, I didn’t really rack up the consequences too quickly because I had limited drinking opportunities. My mother is a sober alcoholic, and I think she was quietly preparing for my teenage years - just waiting for the day I was introduced to alcohol so she could jump right in and do everything in her power to make sure I didn’t turn into an alcoholic like her. Yeah, that didn’t work out.

Looking back at my teenage years, there were definitely signs that I might have a problem with alcohol. I remember once I was at a house party and my friends and I went in on a 30-rack. When I got to the party, I took 4 or 5 beers out of the box and hid them throughout the house. I didn’t want the end of the night to come and for me to have nothing left to drink. For me, there was nothing worse than being without alcohol when I wanted it.

When I got to college, that’s when things really went to shit. I went from a girl with an 11 pm curfew and mother who smelled her breath every night to someone living in a new city, with no curfew, no supervision and surrounded by other 18-year-olds who wanted to party like they were in an Asher Roth music video.

Three weeks into school, my roommates and friends, who again…I knew for three weeks, held an intervention for me in the dining hall. Apprentice-style, these girls sat across the table from me and basically told me that I was embarrassing and needed to get it together. I took their advice into consideration and found new friends.

Freshman and Sophomore year are honestly a blur. Just nights filled with excessive drinking, me getting into horrible fights with everyone who crossed my path (I was an angry drunk), random regretful hookups, and me waking up on Sunday mornings crying, promising myself I wasn’t going to do it again.

My behavior when I was drinking was abhorrent. The worst part about it was that I was constantly blacking out, so I had no memory of what I was doing when I was drinking. These stories were relayed to me by the poor unfortunate souls who had to watch me burn down everything in my path, Godzilla style. My behavior was so bad that I used to delete my text messages in my blacked-out state before going to bed so that I wouldn’t have to look at the embarrassing things I said to people the night before. In the morning, I would just wake up and creep around my apartment, trying to figure out if I did anything the night before that would warrant my roommates being mad at me.

Today I can say the words, “my behavior when I was drinking was abhorrent,” but back when I was drinking, I would never admit or accept that the drinking is what caused my behavior. I thought that I just needed to find the right antidepressant, switch from vodka to beer, or eat more before drinking. I remember when my therapist suggested that I stop drinking. It felt like someone sucked all the air out of my lungs. She then asked if I ever considered abstaining from alcohol and I immediately told her that “no, I had not,” and got to work on drinking in moderation. If you are here, I am assuming you know how that turned out. 

I used to count out three drinks before going to the bars and then give my friends all my cash so I could pay for the cabs there and back, and that’s it (Uber did not exist yet). I would always give my money to my mentally weakest friend though. Whoever I thought I could manipulate into letting me hold on to my money. The bar we were at had a small side-bar with one girl who sold $1 shots. Once I got the cash, I went behind the bar, crouched down, and handed her $5. She looked at me like I was insane (I was), and I just informed her that my friends couldn’t see me drink, so if she could please hurry up, that would be great.

I don’t think that I have ever tried harder at anything in my life than I did to drink like a normal person. To drink in safety. And I would have given you one of my limbs if it meant I could drink normally. The idea of having to quit drinking as a 19-year-old was too unbearable of a thought. I did try to stop drinking from time to time. It would usually happen after some dire consequence – I would sober up for a bit until the dust settled and people forgot what they were mad at me for. That’s basically what my sophomore and junior year looked like. Me drinking and self-destructing and then me white-knuckling for a few days or a few weeks. There were actually some times where I was afraid to go out. I would go to the pregame, panic, and then leave and go to bed. Sometimes I was terrified of drinking; I knew what happened when I drank.

My last drink was April 21, 2014. People always ask if something terrible happened the day before and why I decided to quit that day. Honestly, my behavior was no worse or better than it was any other day. If you ask me, I thought I was pretty mild-mannered, but my boyfriend, who wasn’t speaking to me, might disagree. The truth is that I just woke up that morning tired of saying sorry. I felt like all I did was say sorry. Constantly apologizing to people and trying to make things right. I just wanted to live a life where I didn’t wake up in the morning terrified to face everyone because I didn’t know what horrible thing I did or said the night before.

I went to an AA meeting that night and got my first big book. Luckily this was the end of my Junior year. I am not sure I would have stayed sober if I tried in the beginning or middle of the semester. I went home for summer break and really just threw myself into AA. I had been going to meetings with my mom since I was four, so fortunately I knew what I needed to do if I wanted to stay sober. I didn’t get a 24-hour chip until I had 3 weeks or so, though. I think I just had no confidence in myself that I would stay sober. I had tried so many times before, so why would this be different.

I was fortunate enough to find a fantastic sponsor and an amazing fellowship of young people in AA. I was only 20 when I got sober, so for me, this felt like the end of my social life. I have been shown time and time again by my dozens of sober friends that this is not the case. I dove into the step work, practically stalking my sponsor, asking when she could meet next. I only had three months until my senior year, and I was terrified of going back to school and drinking. When my sponsor gave me my 1-year coin that following summer, she even lovingly said, “I didn’t think you’d make it.” It sort of stung, but it also filled me with pride. I had stayed sober for an entire year of college. An entire year of living on campus in a house with 9 other partying girls. Honestly, it was one of the best years of my life. Not just because of what I was able to accomplish and what I was able to change about myself, but because of how I learned to love and forgive myself. I no longer had to walk around campus with my eyes glued to the sidewalk. I could look people in the eye and tell them that I was sober. That I wasn’t that girl they knew anymore.

My newfound sobriety definitely didn’t erase my past. There were plenty of people on campus who I had hurt too deeply to be swayed or interested in how I had changed. And that’s ok, I don’t blame them. Some hurts are just too painful to fix, and I have to live with that.

Today I am 7 years sober. I am living with the man I love, our two cats (sons), and I am currently finishing my Master of Social Work. I am also a counselor at a residential addiction treatment center which is the most amazing thing ever. However, sometimes in the counselor position, I focus so much on the clinical aspect of substance abuse, I forget what it's like to live in such pain.

I decided to write and post this because I realized that I am starting to forget where I came from, what I’ve been through, what I have put other people through.

I recognize the benefits of many of the steps and have a desire to grow spiritually. I'm just surrounded by people that hammer into me the idea that I'm going to fail if I don't surrender my life to a HP, pray, etc. I've tried pretending, tried believing, and taken suggestions, but it just doesn't vibe with me. It hasn't ever in my 10 years experience with trying to get sober. I don't think it ever will. I understand that manifestations of self (mainly fear in my case) block me from contentment, fulfillment, and connection with others. I see the benefits of living by spiritual principles and continuing to grow towards that ideal, but I also worry that I'm just ""not completely surrendering"" as I hear so often. I'd really appreciate any input from people that have experience with staying sober as an atheist, or even people that worked the steps as an atheist/agnostic and eventually grew into a belief.

I had another account originally when I first got sober so this is a newer one.

This is the longest time sober since the drinking started in high school.  I’m almost 58 years old.  Joined this sub in the fall of 2017 and my first day sober that year was on my birthday, August 7th.

Whenever I felt an urge or needed encouragement I came here. Still do. Practically every day.

Whenever I need new ideas or tips to stay sober I came here.

Whenever I wanted to relate to struggles and even success stories I came here.

Whenever I had doubts about the supposed benefits of drinking but needed reality I came here.

Whenever I needed to be reminded of how bad I felt after a bender I came here.

Whenever I felt like the only person in the world ‘dying’ for a drink i changed my mind when I came here.

Whenever times were lonely, it harkened me back to reaching for a bottle for comfort, instead I came here.

Whenever I chose to decline a party loaded with booze and bad decisions I knew it was better if I came here.

Whenever I wanted to end another dry day with a smile and new knowledge for the next day I came here.

Whenever I needed to be reminded how incredibly fortunate I am to be sober I came here.

Whenever I needed a virtual advisor I found them through countless anonymous  people when I came here.

Whenever I saw who I was and who I want to be I read it in so many posts and threads when I came here.

For those reasons and others I am glad that I came here in fall 2017 and continue to do so. SD saved my life.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** 

Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

ACTION: Any Change Towards Improving One’s Nature

My favorite word since I quit drinking is *Gratitude.* No lie and definitely no joke, I didn’t even know what gratitude was before I quit. It was a word that never circulated in my very limited vocabulary. It was impossible for me to find anything to treasure or to be thankful for because I was sick as fuck. Thinking about it now, how could I be grateful when I was practically dying? My soul, it was just gone. I was spiraling *fast* and losing hope that I could ever find peace or be happy again. And then the most magical thing happened, I quit drinking and everything changed. I was given a second chance at life with that chance my gratitude grew and grew, day by day. 

My mom is an original Badass Warrior, a wise old-timer in sobriety. She got sober back in the early 80’s when they smoked cigs in meetings and has been a winner and a hero ever since. She’s always said, “Sobriety is the gift of a lifetime, it is just the greatest gift in life.” Now I understand what she’s been saying all these years. This is why gratitude is hands down one of the main reasons I’m sober today. Because when things go South there’s always a way Up if I can find the gratitude and the good and just know that this is a gift to be endlessly grateful for. 

A few ways that helped me with my Attitude of Gratitude. For everything that sucks I write down three things that don’t suck. And if things don’t suck I still write down a few little things I’m grateful for today. Old school, in a journal. Every night when I first quit drinking I’d end my day by writing in my journal. I made organized lists; 3 things I’m grateful for, 3 things I’m proud of and 3 positives in my life today. Then I’d do some bonus writing just to get some extra feelings out because I had quite a few extra feelings. Sometimes I recite my gratitude list with others in recovery which never fails to be helpful. For me it’s simple, if I can focus on what I do have then I am totally okay. And my gosh, it’s all more than good because I’m pledging not to drink for the next 24 hours!

An Attitude Of Gratitude is magical but it takes action and consistent work to find the light. Gratitude is a quick way to slam myself back in the moment and into perspective rather than worrying about things that are out of my control. Gratitude is a gateway to all the great things that come with recovery; freedom, self-love, forgiveness, acceptance, serenity, peace, kindness, living without fear, unconditional love and letting go. Just to name a few, I could go on and on.

My go-to gratitude list is this: I’m alive, I’m sober and I have an opportunity to be better today.

If you feel like sharing, what three things are you grateful for today? 

I’m incredibly grateful for every one of you, that’s for damn sure! And if you have 30 days or more and are interested in hosting the DCI please let u/SaintHomer know!

**Expectations:** Today I will wake up early. I'll have time to go for a morning run before my morning coffee. I'll be awake for work when I sign in (I work from home). After work I'll have a little me time before I call a supportive buddy for an evening hike (a tradition we are trying to start).

**Reality:** Today I woke up slightly late due to having trouble sleeping (alcohol withdrawal symptom). Unfortunately, the sleeping in made me miss my morning run and coffee. I felt a little light headed for work and lost my voice slightly (nicotine withdrawal symptoms). Around noon I decided to take some time off to go for a run. After the run I finished the rest of my work day. I got a call from a less than supportive buddy to hang out after he runs an errand near my place. I told him that I was planning to go for a hike with our other buddy (a supportive friend) and he was welcome to come, and that I wasn't drinking or smoking. When my supportive buddy got off work I called him only to find out that he needed to work late that day and couldn't make the hike. I panicked a little since my less supportive buddy was on his way towards my place and he didn't answer his phone. I didn't want to hike with just him because his hikes turn into slow cigarette filled walks and pocket beer stops... I decided to go for a walk alone (in case my friend shows up after his errand). On the walk I stop my my town's store to grab a snack. I had a large craving for cigarettes and alcohol as soon as I walked in. Instead of think about not grabbing it I struck up a conversation with the cashier while picking up my snack (lightly salted nuts, seltzer, cheese). When I walked up to the counter the cigarettes stared my down as did the hard alcohol. The conversation continued during the purchase and I said bye. I walked down to the beach and enjoyed nuts, seltzer, and cheese. My phone rang and I ignored it. I got a text and my less supportive friend was at my house. I ignored it. I'm taking this one step at a time.

She's young and I am hoping her memories are filled with a sober me. I want to live to see her grow and be there when she needs me. I can't do that drunk or sick. Unfortunately, this man's family was embarrassed about his lifestyle and addiction and wasn't incredibly supportive. The stigma of an alcoholic is real. The social worker I spoke to over a year ago when I was in the hospital told me most alcoholics she's met and worked with are some of the most empathetic and kind people she's met. People often view alcoholics as selfish, but they don't see the very real self-awareness many of us have and it is painful. Keep on trying, even if you mess up. Even if you relapse, it doesn't discredit the times you were strong and said no. Iwndwyt ❤️",118,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6253662}"

But, when I say YES to too much, take on too much, I get overloaded, feel like I'm losing control, then Boom - over-committed, over-scheduled, Bam - booze. 

So, what's working for me is...staying aware of my tendency to over-promise/commit, I now say No Thank You more often, deliberately, kindly and clearly. People are noticing, some getting bothered by it, but my spirit gods are thanking me! 

It's working. I've tried it a few times, mostly with my extended family and some best friends, even neighbors. Brother, Cousin and Father, mostly. 

Case in point, they regularly do something, or suggest something, with loving intent but with me saying YES all the time (fearing I'll offend or hurt their feelings), it has created much pressure and over-Scheduling in my life, for decades. So, last week - my Dad shows me a really cool walking stick that his close friend hand made, absolutely beautiful. I said, I did that for (my son's) birthday several years ago, it wasn't as nice as that one but it was really fun to do and if I could retire and just do that all day, I'd be a happy man. 

My Dad said, oh good, I'll go send an email to (his friend) and connect you two and you can talk about making these together, share notes. I'll copy you and your guys can talk. 

I immediately got stressed, felt that weight coming on.... seeing the future... having to schedule a phone call with somebody I don't really know, etc. Then what - talk about making walking sticks together? 

I loved the process of making the walking stick, alone. It was meditative, calming and totally challenging, learning a new skill. I LOVED the process. I just liked doing it, almost like reading a book or going outside to shoot some hoops for some exercise or go workout. 

Last year, I would've said Thanks, that'll be great, and get stressed. In my life history, I always said yes to stuff like that... fearing I wouldn't meet the expectations of others, in this case my Dad.... even if it added unnecessary stress or work for me, or ruined an otherwise totally enjoyable thing for me, alone. 

So, because this has been on my mind, I quickly said, good idea but No Thanks Dad. He got offended. I simply said, it's not something I'd like to do with someone else, I don't even know if I WANT to do it at all. I was just remembering how fun it was. Still offended, he was pissed. Last year, if I didn't just say Yes, and he got offended, I would've said, why or you getting so offended, I don't want to make f-ing walking sticks with your d-head friend I barely know. He'd say, I'm sorry, I forgot how busy you are to spend time doing things you love to do.... Uncomfortable silence, not talking, others are scared with our argument, just a shit storm for no reason. Yeh, it was like that sometimes, not all the time, but you probably get it. 

Instead, what I said was something that worked, and I'm going to use it again. I said, Dad, if you let this go, I'll let it go, and we can immediately talk about something different, like Dr. Phil or Oprah (shows he likes), and I smiled. 

I think it worked anyway. And big win, we didn't talk about Dr Phil or Oprah! We just moved on. 

That's my quick learn for the day.

2021-04-28 17:32:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/n0pdco/trying_to_understand/,Trying to understand,"I’m trying to understand my problem with alcohol. In my 20s and abused it for a few years. When I was 21 I went through a bad breakup and started hanging out with friends and drinking a lot more often. This turned into drinking alone, and a self sabotage cycle. 

I hated the feeling but I loved to sleep during this depression and I guess it helped me sleep. I felt more like “me.” I strangely felt like all the chemicals in my brain, and everything in my life balanced out perfectly and stabilized me. (Obviously I know that’s not what it was doing and I wasn’t dealing with things properly. But that’s how I felt.) I didn’t do anything extremely stupid while drinking it was the drinking alone everyday that made me realize I had a problem. 
So I drastically cut back and don’t actively seek it out unless I’m having a productive day and feel like chilling out at night. I feel okay to do this because it’s not to get drunk 

My question is: while I get the hard liquor, I don’t drink a lot of it. I also don’t drink a lot at once to get drunk if you know what I mean. Example: playing a video game on a Friday night  I’ll take a shot but that’ll be it for an hour. And it strangely levels my anxiety and just levels me out to “normal.” It’s like a small dose of medication. But that’s it? I don’t think about wanting/needing more. Can’t tell if it’s comforting because it’s habitual, or just that small little medication “dose” I need to feel level headed and calm my nerves. However it is problematic because my boyfriend does not like any sort of drinking and doesn’t seem to understand that it’s not to get plastered or to get drunk to me. Hasn’t been an issue. 

I know that I have an anxiety issue and the whole thing about using to self medicate and what not. I also know this probably sounds like I’m making excuses. It’s all true. I guess I just don’t understand why I can control it so easily, don’t like the feeling of being drunk or hungover, but just want those couple shots- I basically am unwinding like everyone else when they order a drink at dinner or pour a drink at home. Am I truly an alcoholic or is there something deeper here? Did I truly just go through a really bad and tough patch not realizing how destructive alcohol can be in excess? Should I just stop entirely? I know myself and also know I have truly overcame drinking a lot when people stopped trying to tell me to not drink so much. Hence this post. So my issue is that if I stop entirely I feel like my mind will just retaliate and it’ll backfire. Sorry for the long post, it’s my first one.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5621215}"

I would go on to relapse multiple times. To begin with every 3 to 4 days for a day or 2 but sometimes more and eventually pulling together a run of 43 consecutive days sober. Since that relapse it has been up and down in terms of sobriety. To say it has been a whirlwind of a journey would be an understatement.

The reason for my post is that this comes up frequently on here. Members will often post about having been sober for a while (a few weeks plus) but not feeling better or that the euphoria of sobriety subsided in a few weeks. This is exactly my story so wanted to share it.

When I began, I had no expectations. I guess we all have some kind of expectations on some level but for me it was as simple as that I was tired and wanted out. I couldn’t be that person anymore and didn’t want that life anymore. When my sobriety finally stuck at the beginning of those 43 days, my life felt amazing. I was just so amazed that I could live a day out of shackles. No planning all day what I would be drinking in the evening.

What I didn’t really know is what was to come for me. Again, I never really set out with many expectations. But looking back I guess I thought that if I didn’t drink I would revert back to the old me. A me that is riddled with problems. But that is ok because I thought if I sobered up and then fixed that person I could then be strong enough to resist drink. I was wrong! I couldn’t revert back to that person. That person is still there and I can still get back to him. But between me and him is a buffer. This is the buffer that alcohol has built up. It is the buffer where I never had a problem because alcohol wrapped all of my problems into one convenient addiction. Basically, alcohol deferred all of my problems to tomorrow. I kept running but then ran out of energy. It is very hard to describe but for 5 years I lied to myself and to the world. Alcohol gave me ways to think I am stronger than I really am, I can deal with things that I hadn’t actually dealt with. When I stopped drinking I lost the mechanism I had used for 5 years to deal with life. Eventually sobriety by itself meant my problems quickly caught up with me.

It was at this point I crumbled. I was sober but around day 35 I began to feel worse. It’s hard to describe but the whole world seemed grey. I couldn’t feel anything but negativity. No matter what I tried I couldn’t snap out of it. I thought all the time. There was no off switch. And then came the point where I drank.

Drinking made things worse. At this point the only feeling I had was hopelessness. I had a failed attempt at sobriety. But, and I didn’t know this at the time, the sobriety had taught me enough to know the drink wasn’t helping either. So I am drinking heavily, hungover and basically have no where to go. This was a very dark couple of weeks.

Bit by bit I begin to have sober days again. And today I feel happy. I know I’m not cured and I know I am at risk of relapse. But really my reflection of my life since 22 January is that I tried to do something that I did not have the tools for. I don’t think I am alone in that. I think in early sobriety many of the people here would not have the tools to make it through on the first attempt. I felt like I am literally learning by failing at every single step. But today I have been reflecting on this and I think it has been more than that. I do believe I now have some tools. There are certain things I am avoiding. There are certain issues that I am educating myself on and most importantly, if I feel anxious, I read about it. What shocked me most is that I didn’t feel I would have huge amounts of shame and guilt but I do and that is something I am working on.

I’m not really sure what point I’m trying to make but I guess it is along the lines of that sometimes sobriety isn’t just going to work. Not drinking in itself doesn’t reverse the damage done by drinking. But it 100% stops anymore happening. And accepting difficult times and sometimes rough patches in the journey is part and parcel of recovery.",10,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44267827}"

I went to rehab ten years ago, checked my own self in, cuz of the toxic environment I was in was scaring me. Prior to that place, I was strictly beer, pot and mushrooms. NO LIQUOR. I learned that when I was much younger, swore off booze and stuck with beer only. And it kinda worked out.   
I was a pothead, hippie, did more than my share of acid, and decided to give up on a lot of that. My pot-smoking decreased dramatically, avoided LSD since 95, and only ate shrooms on *really* special occasions.  
Then I found myself in very strange circumstances. Jager entered my world, then back to tequila and rum. I blame the alcohol for my shitty choices of taking whatever random pills were offered. And started getting hooked.   
Opiates are no joke.   
There was one night when I found myself plastered doing cocaine that I knew I was in a bad way. The next morning I got myself into a detox joint and then into rehab.     
I went 2 1/2 yrs clean and sober. Went to an Octoberfest thing with my new gf, and that was that.   
Came down with jaundice a few years later and quick all stuff except occasional pot for six months.  Golden.  
Anyway, it's been off and on since then. I spent this past Christmas and New Year in the hospital for almost three months cuz my liver was planning on giving out on me.  Over four months of sobriety, feeling better than ever, eating healthier than ever, and just really digging it - pandemic or not, I've been doing really well managing the boredom. But I'd been having sleep issues all along. Being on covid-induced unemployment, i.e. no set routine, has really fucked me up. I started eating melatonin, which helped me fall asleep but not stay asleep. It was really driving me nuts, and I remembered that in rehab, they would give us benedryl at night, so I decided to give that a try. Same result though. Got me to sleep, but didn't keep me asleep. So after weeks of three hour naps dispersed throughout the day, I decided, why the hell not?   
So I got me a six-pack.  
Drank it in what I thought was a nicely-paced interim of a few hours. Didn't get drunk, but nicely buzzed - that old familiar feeling. Went to sleep at a reasonable time, and woke up ten hours later. Ten hours of uninterrupted sleep.   
Yeah, well.........     
I broke the seal.  Opened the floodgates.  It helped me sleep so well, I went out and got another sixer. And I slept wonderfully that night as well. Next day, got me a twelve-pack. Had a beer after breakfast that day cuz why not, I got no commitments today.    
And it began.  Again.    
It's only been a week, but that monkey has jumped back on me, and I can't go through this again. Alcohol *WILL* be the death of me. Of this, I am certain, unless I can end this.

I've been on the roller coaster of binge to sobriety for 15 years now. They've heard it so much it doesn't even register anymore. 

I'm currently 2mos off the wagon after a 3 month sobriety and the stresses and mistakes are building again. It's all so familiar and predictable yet I find myself here again. My most recent sobriety was great and when I broke it I knew I'd end up here, but I just said ""well you know you can sober up again when you need to"" but what's the point. I'm not doing well at work and and I'm half assing things on a regular enough basis that I'm on my boss's radar. I tend to get angry when I'm drunk and I've damaged personal property that I'm having to replace. My relationships are suffering. yada yada. Been here before. So it's time to sober up again and get everything back in order before there is any lasting consequences. 

On the one hand I'm proud that I've reached the point that I can recognize when I've pushed it as far as I can without *really* fucking up. In the past I've lost jobs, a wife, failed out of school. I was able to come back from all that. Right now my routine is something like drink on the weekend and inevitably let it drag into the work week. Spend Tuesday through Friday fighting the urge and scraping by. Repeat ad nauseum. I'm going to sober up again for idk a week, a month, a year. No telling. But I hate knowing that it'll come back around again. I'm so tired of fighting it. I'm my best self when I'm sober other than having little to no social life and that's what always pulls me back in. Then I end up drunk with no social life because I'm hiding my drinking from everyone because it's gotten out of hand again and I'm isolating, anxious, and angry. I don't wish me luck, but I don't need it. I'll sober up and get everything in line...and then I'll slowly take it to the edge again.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7114892}"

They checked me in with pretty massive internal bleeding from my esophagus. 

Spent last Tuesday to this Monday in the hospital before being released. I barely remember Tuesday/Wednesday and what I do, I can't trust because of hallucinations I was having.  The doctors basically said it could have gone either way. My wife was preparing to have to tell my daughter that her dad wasn't coming home from the hospital.

It's the lowest I have ever been. And I won't go back to that place. I am letting my body heal and will stop poisoning myself.  This is the longest without a drink I have gone in decades (8 days) and will watch that number continue to climb.

2021-04-28 14:56:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/n0lzll/support_options/,Support Options,"Hi - I am go grateful to have discovered this subreddit. It has helped on a number of occasions to reinforce motivation to not drink and quieten the internal 'pro-drinking' monologue. I am very much a binge drinker, when I start I cannot stop and when I am not drinking I spend far too much time thinking about when and what to drink. In all, drinking consumes far too much of me and my time.  My drinking cycle starts on Friday and ends on Sunday night. Every Monday, I wake up groggy, feel totally unprepared for work with zero motivation to do anything other than feel sorry for myself. I vow to stop drinking and treat my self-loathing by discovering yet another self-help\\sobriety podcast. This sequence of events has been ongoing for too long. Today (Wednesday), is usually the start of when I begin to seriously think about drinking again, how I deserve a drink and how I should perhaps treat myself to a midweek beer or wine. Thankfully I usually ignore this but the feeling, anticipation and excitement will grow as the week progresses towards Friday when I know I can start drinking (rinse and repeat).

I am due to be a father for the first time and I have been trying to stop this cycle. I recently ended a 7 day stint without booze. It was a Monday, the weather was nice, the pub gardens had recently re-opened in the UK and so I totally caved. Whilst I only had 2 pints, it suddenly meant I could allow myself to drink at the weekend. I justified this by telling myself that I would go for a long walk in the country, stop off at a pub have a couple, maybe stop off at another pub closer to home and have some more. The rationale; it would be my final pub drink and by combining this with a really long walk, I deserved it. It's pathetic and really selfish given what my wife is going through in bearing our child. 

Today I have been strong, I was able to go to my work office, I had a productive day and then felt I most definitely deserved to have some wine. But on my drive home I considered the future, I thought about how I would hate myself tomorrow, how I would feel rubbish for work and how I could instead do something productive, something I would otherwise continuously put off but then wish I could do.  So I got home and put in an hour of study.

Sorry for the lengthy ramble, I just wanted to provide a bit of context before asking for advice on direct support options. I kind of feel alone on all of this, the podcasts, audiobooks etc help but I think I need some support which is more interactive, to share experiences, help grow strength etc. Can anyone recommend any online sponsors\\groups etc? Nothing too heavy but just some way of checking in and developing a rapport with a group\\individual?

To be clear I have never had big problems due the alcohol like getting into fights or forgetting things nor drinking every day, but I know it doesn't improve in any way.

So march came month of my birthday, and to be honest I was very emotional affected so I decided to drink just for my birthday, I drank without shame, nor regrets, I told myself this is not a relapse is just this free week and then back to sobriety. Didn't happen that way, I even drank later to relief emotional pain, which was a big no for me like "" you will not drink because you are sad"" that was like a big limit which I crossed.

Today I realized that it was not a good idea to drink the very first sip on March, today I'm restarting my counter and damn it hits realizing that wrong step.

I know it's not 1.3 year of sobriety wasted but just keep on trying.

I gradually started drinking nightly about 13 years ago- 6 beers max and on some nights, I had no problem abstaining, by choice.  Well as of covid-19 and being able to work from home, I became a regular day drinker, working from home and having beer for breakfast and lunch. It satisfied my hunger quickly and was easier than fixing food.  It's really started to affect my anxiety, temper, fitness and sleep.  I had been trying to taper off- I'd do ok for a day or two max, get comfortable and grab a beer. This became the cycle. 3 nights ago I didn't get a single wink of sleep and had major anxiety- the next morning was horrible, but I wasn't in a spot where I could call in sick- I had too many commitments.  As I shook and perspired at my desk, I decided that I was done. I was craving a beer after coming home from a workout last night, but I held strong and it really wasn't difficult, however, I'm still struggling to get a good night of sleep. 

I also feel like a whiny baby as it's been such a short amount of time and I'm stressed about the recovery I'm going to have to push through.  

While I realize that everyone is different, I'm pretty nervous about what the next 30 days or so hold for me. The anxiety has started to fade and I only get it in brief flashes now, but despite working out and trying to stay busy, I usually am wide awake and panicked after 5 hours of sleep (sometimes less).

What can I do to help my sleep?  I have taken diphenhydramine or melatonin to help sleep before - but I don't want to replace one lousy chemical dependance for another.  I want natural, refreshing slumber.

Any tips on better sleep?  Any idea of what kind of timeline I should expect until I can wake up without mental exhaustion.

Last year i realized i needed to quit drinking, i was consistently drinking everyday for over 5 years prior to that. 

Its funny when i quit, i fully anticipated life to just get better. I expected to have better sleep, a clearer mind, and feel happy. To be honest, that wasnt the case. For the first 9 months or so I had awful anxiety, depression and brain fog. I also had horrible nights sleep as i struggled to fall asleep sober for the first time. On top of this i went through a hard breakup my second month of sobriety.

I was really discouraged at first, i thought to myself, ""Is this forever?"", ""Is this the new me?"" 
I remember reading all of the posts here saying how much better things got immediately after drinking and wondering why i wasnt feeling the same?

What i realized is that alot of what i was experiencing were problems that were already present, but just drowned out with booze. 
Sobriety has given me the ability to see the root problems that led to drinking and allowed me to tackle them head on in a healthy way.

Now, finally, after 1 year sober i feel so much better. My anxiety is almost non existent, my mental clarity is back and i feel genuinely happy.
I feel more true to my self not having to deal with the duplicity of being a closeted alcoholic.

Ive now been able to feel pride in my sobriety and focus on the things i enjoy. Ive been learning how to play piano. Ive completely redecorated my room. Its feels freeing.

It was my first time hanging out with friends in over a year since the pandemic. It was a special occasion because we could all get together and drink again. I had a bad feeling going into the evening on Saturday. My worst fears were realized. Within 15 minutes, I was very close to losing everything. My freedom, my relationship and my future. 

I have been convicted of two DUIs, crashed three cars and have had countless blackouts hardly knowing what happened the night before. I have been so fortunate that I have not killed anyone. I have just turned 30 and all I can remember is the painful time in my 20s were caused by alcohol. I was fine early on but then the blackouts started to happen. I remember in college it was MLK weekend. That's when almost EVERY weekend was a blackout. They've been happening ever since. There I times I could have one drink with the right people and be okay. But was I really okay or was I just masking the problem? There are times where people have said to me, "" When you drink you're a totally different person."" I always didn't think I had a problem, a disease, an addiction. However as it turns out, it was just that. 

That is because I have an addiction. I'm an alcoholic. I have a physical disease that will not allow me to consume alcohol like anyone else because I cannot stop once I start. It is the first time I had the selflessness to admit that I have a problem.

So on April 25th 2021, I have decided to get sober. My parents were heavily involved in program. In Ala-non, I grew up reading the 12 steps and traditions. I even went to Ala-teen even though no one in the house was using. During both of my DUI convictions, I had to attend meetings and felt like I didn't belong there. Boy was I wrong.

I am so scarred of relapse. I'm scared that I have had a freedom taken away from me. I don't want to lose what I have. I spent the entirety of Sunday in bed with the windows shut. I had to vomit over 20 times. I understand it's my selfish mind thinking ahead. I have to realize that it's going to be okay and I have to take it one day at a time because there is no telling what the future has in store for me.

I am so glad I found this place. I already have a big book and I picked up Russell Brand's book on addiction. I want to beat this. I know I can beat this.

Then, my friends mom bought me and my friends some beer, and I was hooked. From when I was 16 to when I was about 18, I would go over to their house weekly and binge drink. Then, from when I was about 18 to about 4 months ago, I was drinking daily to some capacity. It started off having one of those massive cans of Highlife every night after work to two, then to a 6 pack and eventually for about 2 years, 6 to 8 drinks of hard liquor every night, sometimes more, never less. I knew I was heading down a dark path, but I pushed it to the back of my head and kept drinking.

It got really bad when my mother got sick with liver disease. She was on narcotics for pain for years, took acetaminophen every day for years in excess, and on top of that, she was a heavy drinker. Her drinking progressed, she developed acites and jaundice and eventually went to the hospital. She was diagnosed with NASH (she did not tell the physicians that she was a drinker). We all urged her to stop drinking, and she did for a while. Her jaundice went away, but she started drinking again. 

Fast forward a year, and she is taken away in an ambulance for confusion, and she is diagnosed with cirrhosis. A week later, she was admitted to a hospice where she passed away. 

Ironically, this didn't make me quit. It made me drink more. I would wake up in the middle of the night and drink. I would drink all day, I was always shitfaced. This continued for about 4 months, until I was drinking about a handle of vodka a day. The next 3 months I didn't even feel human. I was vomiting 5 times a day or more, I wasn't eating, most or all of my calories were from Smirnoff. I woke up one morning and saw a tinge of yellow in my eyes. My dad didn't see it, but I did. I decided enough was enough. I didn't have anything to drink when I woke up. I started seeing things, similar to what you see sometimes when you close your eyes, but it was always there. I rubbed my eyes, it was still there. I knew I was going into withdrawal. I had 2 gulps of vodka, but it was still there. The yellow was more pronounced now, and I felt weak. I went to to the hospital.

I went to the hospital alone because of covid, and realized how confused I was. All I said to the nurse was ""I drank a lot and I feel bad"". I couldn't think of anything else to say. The sent me to triage, then the er. They did blood tests, and while those were being done, they informed me that I had gone into DTs. Then, a doctor came in and informed me that I had drank myself into liver failure. I couldn't process it, but I called my dad and told him. I'll never forget the sound in his voice. He was shattered. That moment, I promised myself I'd never drink a drop of alcohol again in my life whether that be 3 months or 30 years. 

The next 3 days were filled with a daze of hallucinations and confusion. They wouldn't let me eat. They pumped me full of Ativan and nutrients as I was malnourished and at risk of seizures. They diagnosed me with alcoholic hepatitis. Eventually, I was released but they made me promise I'd go see a doctor. I was still yellow, I still was weak, but I was alive and detoxed from alcohol. My life was filled with panic attacks and worries that I would leave my family behind due to a disease I inflicted on myself. Doctor appointment after doctor appointment, my liver enzymes went up. My bilirubin in the hospital was 7.8, and my highest bilirubin level was 10.2 after I had quit drinking for a month.
I saw a gastro, who said that I needed to stay off alcohol. I asked him about cirrhosis, and he said he was sure I had at least SOME cirrhosis. I decided that even if this was going to kill me, I'd do everything in my power go give myself the best chance. I started exercising more, eating better (I used keto, low carb may reduce fat content in the liver) and not taking acetaminophen or any over the counter drugs. 

But then, they started to change. My alt and ast slowly came down, and eventually my bilirubin went down to .5. My liver enzymes were near normal. My gastro ordered tests, including a Fibrosure and GGT. Just yesterday, he called to bring me into an appointment. I was terrified. All of my fears were culminating to this one appointment, I'd figure out exactly how bad it was. I ask him ""did my fibrosure come back?"" He said it did, and his eyes get really wide. ""Zero."" I was confused ""Zero? Like, if I were on this scale (points to chart of progression of fibrosis to cirrhosis) where would I be?"" He just points toward the end of the scale and says ""all the way"". He was floored, and so was I. I have no fibrosis. I still have Alcoholic Seatohepatitis, but it's improving. My fibrosure came back at a 0.09.

It's never too late to stop. Some people keep drinking because they figure they're too far gone. ""What does it matter, I'm already dying of this."" Some people just can't stop. But I hope at least someone takes inspiration from this. No matter what stage you're at, you can recover to some degree, and if you stop early enough, you can escape with minimal damage done. I took the step, in the moment, not the next day, not later the same day, right then. Alcohol is not a part of my life anymore. No non alcoholic beer, no mocktails. I didn't have anything that reminded me of drinking because that may have just increased my cravings for it. I was at risk for DTs so I went to the hospital. It was important for me tell them exactly how much I drank and for how long. I got judged, but this is my life, amd I did anything necessary to improve my chances. 

The doctor and I were both sure I had fibrosis, likely even early cirrhosis, but I don't. And I won't, because IWNDWYT.",39,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6112393}"

It was the best start I have had yet, albeit the past few weeks have moved to more slips than clean days. Otherwise, well, those slips turned into benders. Don't really recall the weekend, certainly not Monday. Tuesday morning I knew I had to go in for help. I am no where I want to be and I will lose more the longer I go. Had a goodbye pint of whiskey (why?) and went to the ER. As I waited for the hours to pass, the nutrients to rehydrate me through the IV, and for my BAC to come down low enough for my crisis evaluation, I saw more of the hole that this is in my life (again, and this time I mean it.) The hospital team almost pushed for inpatient admission as, well, I was too stubborn to have more legitimate safety plan for myself aside from going home. (I am a therapist, I should know better than that.) I was there for nearly 8 hours before calling my parents for their help and stayed at their house after crisis deemed that a solid enough plan. Stubborn much? I don't need to hide anymore. Anyone can hide.  


Fortunately my therapist had extra time this morning and really helped paint the honesty of impairment I have come to...and how quickly this despair came up this time. I was struggling to envision the future, when in reality I have a beautiful partner I want to share my life with, start a family with. I have have parents who care. After some more discourse, I was able to picture her face again, see the reality that CAN be ahead of me. I won't have that reality if I continue. I won't be able to be a father. I won't be around for my family, friends, for her, for me, for my big goofy dog who I had to leave at home alone for 18 hours.   


There is work to be done for sure. I get to call work later and talk to my boss, not looking forward to that. I get to talk to my partner later. My parents are coming by for safety check and offered for me to stay with them for a bit as otherwise I live alone in the woods. I ate something today. After slogging through the hurricane-like waste of empties and dirty dishes left in the wake of this last binge, I hope to shower and take a nap. I will certainly be back tomorrow for check in. For now, if you will excuse me, I have a dog I need to go hug. Love you all.

I didn't even think sleeping straight through the night was a thing. I honestly thought you only do that when you are a child. I guess I was a child when I started drinking.

Hi, my name is E.P, 34/F, and I am an alcoholic. This is my first of SO MANY day 2's (Day one was yesterday). I binged again this past weekend into Monday.

I used to be so active in here, and I used to be doing so good. But then, the pandemic got a hold of me again, and I spiraled. It's gotten to the point where I have lost friends, and I am slowly starting to lose family. I need to stop. Desperately.

My heart hurts when I think of all the wasted years. Where I could be right now if I had never picked up social drinking in college, which turned into a full on drinking problem in my late 20's because of my addictive personality.

I don't want this poison in my life anymore. It numbs the boredom and loneliness for an hour or so as I have more, and more, but then I do stupid things like send drunk, hurtful texts to people, post like a toxic person on facebook, write on my sidewalk IN CRAYON, wake up way too late and waste half the day, etc. etc.

It all lends of flavor to sobriety that wasn't there when I was younger. Of course, it also makes being a drunk less appealing because as we get older it gets less and less tolerated by the people around us and also, as we get older we see how much time we're wasting in this dance. 

So, how's it going?

It's been *rough* this past year, mostly because of covid and the boredom that it caused. It also doesn't help that I live 3000 miles from my one actual friend, and that since I quit drinking my social anxiety has been turned up to 11. I also thought my anger and frustrations would subside, but they haven't changed. 

I feel like all I can do is not drink. I've kept myself occupied with running, lego (RIP my wallet), and other various distractions but as soon as I'm unoccupied The Thoughts come back, telling me the lie that my life was better and easier when I was drinking. The truth is that I simply still struggle with everyday things because I don't have the big red ""abort feelings"" button that is alcohol. I still don't really know who I am as an adult who doesn't drink, but I'm sure I'll get there someday. 

All I know is that I can't go back to drinking half a bottle of <insert literally anything with alcohol here> at 5 a.m. to stave off the panic attacks I would have at my morning meetings, then rinse and repeat at every break and lunch, and then when I got home I would drink until I passed out. I'm certain that if I take another sip, it will lead to my death. 

So I'll just run a 5k, watch Star Wars, eat my favorite pizza, and build my shiny new lego imperial probe droid that I bought myself for my soberversary :)

Whenever I feel sad or anxious I remind myself that we are on a rock, flying through space at 67,000mph around an atomic explosion. My problems don’t mean shit in the grand scheme. We should all remember that nothing truly matters outside of ourselves and for that reason we should be happy. We get to choose what matters to us.

-“checking in” once a day for the first 30ish days. AA refers to this as 90 meetings in 90 days. I’m not an AA guy, but if that works for you, do it. Check in here, watch a YouTube video about not drinking, listen to a podcast, do SOMETHING to make yourself not drink for THAT day. 
-a book by Annie Grace called “This Naked Mind”. It changed my perspective on how I look at alcohol and brought up some points that I have never thought of before. She also has a podcast, but if your serious, just buy the $15 book. You probably spent that on booze in a couple of days, or two or three drinks out

Over the last few months I’ve noticed I drink every single day. Not even getting drunk but having atleast a drink or 2 before work, after work, on days off, before going to the grocery store, and pretty much for any possible anything. I work in the restaurant industry and we are all so exhausted and tired from getting treated like shit by 75% of the customers that a couple people started to bring nips to work and we take turns running out to the parking lot to drink. I’ve gained so much weight, and no matter how much I drink whether it be one drink or 7, there wasn’t that “fun” or “buzzed” feeling. I’d feel the same, then It’d hit later that I’m more fucked up than I thought and not in a fun way. 

Not fun at all anymore. I cry every day. I’m gaining so much weight between drinking and binge eating. 

I finally got a friend who has been coming to the gym with me. It’s a small start We go for about a half hour but I’m atleast moving around. 

Last Monday was my only day off and nicest day we’ve had all year. My friend and I went out for drinks and lunch, grabbed some nips and went to the beach with my dog, and we were having a blast. The minute I got home and was alone and got the dogs fed, I just broke down. I went to put my pajamas on and my clothes are just tighter than they were a couple months ago. My face has gotten so fat and just looks sad.

Waking up the next day hungover and mentally drained, I texted people and picked up as many shifts as I could at work, threw away the couple bottles of wine I had, and texted the few people I know who might come to the gym with me to the point where I went to the gym 3 times in one day to keep myself distracted. 

The first couple of days sucked but I didn’t even think about drinking unless something shitty happened. 

I lost 4 lbs alone from not drinking during the week. So Monday comes around, my only day off this week, and a friend and I went out for lunch and to get our nails done. I had a martini, 2 glasses of wine, and we had a couple nips while walking the beach. Fun day again but it’s not like the alcohol made it any more or less fun; until I got home, showered, and got to bed. My head filled with straight sadness and I just wanted another drink but I took some Tylenol pm and called it a night. 

I woke up yesterday morning feeling AWFUL. I had a headache, I threw up when I got up, and I wasted the entire day in bed until I had work at 4. I had eaten decent all last week without stress eating at all, but the I ordered so much greasy fried food from door dash I honestly ate more yesterday than I did in an entire week. 

I hate that it took me this long to take a break at all or to actually realize how bad it is. I drank 1/3 of what I usually drink and it kicked my ass and made me just feel so shitty after waking up every morning energized and feeling fine. When I got home last night my boyfriend had gotten home and he brought home some nips and beer for me and I just had him put it right in the fridge and said he can have it because fuck waking up feeling extra awful every day.

This year has been exceptional in a lot of ways. I piggybacked my sobriety on massive life changes caused by the pandemic. Some of my heaviest past drinking instances - like business trips, weddings, or just plain being alone in the house because my wife and son were on a trip - they were all cut out of my life completely these last twelve months. Because of COVID, nothing happened. It was actually a really great time for me personally to make the switch to being alcohol-free and build up a base of sobriety. 

I’m not going back to drinking, but I can already see that year #2 is going to be challenging. Everything triggering that has been stopped is now slowly starting back up again. My wife and son are heading out of town in early June, so that will be one of the first of many large situational tests of my sobriety. In the coming weeks I’m going to make a plan and I’m pretty sure that it’ll all turn out okay. I’ve put too much into quitting alcohol to slip up now. Sobriety is an amazing feeling. It has not solved every problem in my life, but it has given me a baseline that is immensely better than what it was when I was drinking. 

I owe a lot to r/stopdrinking. Aside from reading This Naked Mind, Reddit has been my main support. I don’t post a lot, but I use the daily check-in periodically and comment on others’ posts. Virtually no one in my life is tackling this challenge, so it is inspiring to read success stories from the communities (and humbling and eye-opening to read the challenges).

2021-04-28 07:09:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/n0cek9/didnt_know_where_to_turn/,Didn't know where to turn.,"Been drinking since i was 15. 36 now.A life lived in fear and booze. I now want to stop. I have a nagging pain in my shoulder, maybe an old injury maybe something more. Went to the A and E /ER after a dizzy spell (which is maybe linked to my low level tinnitus or worse) where i stopped for a while and nothing showed up. So i thought i was clear, and since last summer i've been taking the piss. I think i'm \*\*\*\*ed and that fear is eating away at me and i go a few days without a drop and i feel like \*\*\*\*e, or i get anxious and back to the well i go. I need to stop now. Used to play rugby in those years i was boozing so my health was ok as i was maintaining fitness. Too many head injuries i decided to quit at 34, so the rugby weight ballooned to 130kg at 6,2 even though my diet isn't horrendous (except when i'm on a bender of wine). I suppose IPAs with high levels of estrogen don't help. Even in the ER room i was a few months into being able to run 10k or more (while still drinking and only getting down to 122kg) The runners high just triggered my inner drinker.

Im not a raging raging drinker, those years are past now, but i'm well seasoned, and the fact i can't stop or i spend a hell of a lot of time thinking about beer or wine marks me as one in need of change. I've completely stopped romancing the drink which is something, but its going hand in hand with what i can only describe as anhedonia and a lack of peace, which i know is probably from the drinking itself. I've had mental health issues since i was young, a low level anxiety and dread for as long as i can remember. Saw people went to hospital, but none of that really helped. Its a really deep issue of fear, loss of ego and the dream of being a writer just being a pipedream. Some  good writing fueled by drink, and now the writers block or drowsiness completely fueled by low level drinking.

During lockdown i've been obviously staying out of pubs and i've switched my two wines a week for two or 3 days of 3/4 beers since this all started. I don't crave that glass of red, and i don't think it pairs well with anything in particular (at least thats how im convincing myself). Its just a red liquid. The buzz it gives me is nothing, its basically an illusion, i know that now. The odd weekend i'll do wine, and i'm full of regret. Its over the limits anyhow, and this is probably a 12 month slowdown on 14 years of heavyish drinking. Worst day would have been a half bottle of whiskey, two beers and maybe even a bottle of wine. I'd say the last time i did that was 2017. I couldn't even imagine that now, but i just think the damage is done. Wet brain, cancer who the fuck knows. The best i managed was 1 week. 1 fucking week. Then i just felt terrible, felt like iwas coming down with MS and i had to drink 1 or two glasses of whiskey (seeing i had got rid of all beer and wine).Then i felt better. And i was able to try another few days sober. But the cycle just repeats as i try to taper.

My head is melting and i fear sometimes i'm going mad. I have an easy enough job, moderating and customer account management for a tech company but one thats a deadend and then that just fuels it all as i'm never going to be a writer or sell my photo prints etc. Basically i'm fucked. Utterly fucked. I never would commit suicide as i have a young daughter of 12, now battling her own mental health issues. But i suppose my drinking was a silent form of it. Now i fear its too late. I don't enjoy life necessarily but i don't want to die. I want to see my daughter grow up.

I'm telling myself here now i won't have a beer tonight, but i know its probably an untruth.

Sorry for waffling on i just feel alone in all of this. Writing all this has helped.  I know its really only i who can control it. But i thought i better start somewhere. Will also book a health check in local clinic. But i'd be dreading that for the reasons above. I know nearly every single person on this earth has issues, some far far worse etc. So i'm not complaining or feeling sorry for myself. I still can function, i can still laugh (which isn't necessarily the same thing as enjoyment) I talk to people about these issues, a colleague, parents, my brother. But i always feel like there's a pointlessness to that. We're all ships sailing on our own steam in our own water. We're born alone, we die alone. The connections do help, of course. But when i wake up in the middle of the night thinking i'm dying, partner asleep, its only me. And i'm not sure what to do.

I suppose in all truths be told i'm an alcoholic. An anxiety ridden depressive as well. I suppose living in Ireland, those lines can get blurred.

I couldn’t even picture it in my head. How would I enjoy the first warm days of spring? How would I go camping? Or take a road trip and unwind after a long day in the car? Or go skiing without beers in the chalet? I assumed if I quit drinking I would have to give up all the things I loved to do. My future looked bleak.

But I quit anyway. I had to. I was going to drink myself to death. And I got through those early days by not thinking about the future. It was too painful. I just thought about today. Every day. One day at a time. 

And now I’m here, almost a year and a half sober, and I realized that I can imagine my future again. I picture myself sitting outside on a warm day. Hanging out with friends. Watching my kids play. Going camping and looking up at the stars. And maybe in this imagined future I’m enjoying an NA beverage, or maybe I’m not, because honestly the beverage isn’t really a very important part of that picture. 

And I realize now that the old future I used to imagine was really a sad and pathetic one. A future where I assumed I could only enjoy life if I had many drinks to wash it down with. This future, my new future, my future without alcohol, is actually a so much better one.

***I am really sorry for the post being so late. Lets Start.***

***So I walked out and bought another 4 miniatures. I don't know why but I always started with miniatures. Maybe because they look small and harmless. Consoled my mind into thinking that you ain't drinking much.***

***When I bought the miniatures I never thought that I will start again. In my mind ""ONLY FOR TODAY'. I am a living example of a man who drank without a reason. I had no stresses. A happy loving family. A beautiful girlfriend. Good work & pocket full of cash. Still at that moment I went out and bought the alcohol.***

***I drove off & while driving I drank the first miniature. You all are gonna think it would have tasted delicious. But to me it tasted so fcking bad !!!!! It tasted like a rotten lemon. I realized something then. The taste has always been this bad. But with time your tongue gets used to it. So when I tasted it. I was like Wtf ! Its so bad how did I ever get addicted to it. Oh I will definitely not get addicted to this shit. Funny thing. When I was thinking all this, I had finished the other three as well. As I was drinking after a long time, those 4 miniatures got me high like I had drank half a litre. I smoked a couple of cigs & I dozed off in the car for an hour.***

***I went back home later and slept. Next morning I was very happy. I HAD NO PAIN. I was cured of pancreatitis. LOL how dumb I was. I knew there was no cure. The pancreas will heal itself but it will always remain sensitive to alcohol. I knew that. But still I was thinking I am all good now. So next thing I do when I leave the house is I buy another 4 miniatures. But this time I was smart. Let me tell you how.***

***I sat in my car and thought of why I ended up getting pancreatitis. Here are the reasons I thought of;***

1. ***I drank too much too fast.***
2. ***I drank neat. No water No Soda No Ice.***
3. ***I drank in mornings.***
4. ***I had only whisky. (considered a hard drink)***

***These were the reasons I could come up with. Funny right. So I thought of changing my drinking pattern. I will not drink during daytime. I will not exceed 250ml a day. I will always mix something in it. No more neat. So I started drinking. I followed my rules for sometime. I have no idea how things spiraled down so fast. Within 2 months I was an alcoholic again. I was drinking in day time. I was drinking around a bottle a day. Though I followed 1 rule not to drink neat. LOL. Around Sep 2017, I started experiencing a little pain in my abdomen. I got so so so so so scared. I was having having cold sweats when the pain started. I immediately flushed the remaining alcohol & started my homeopathy medicine again. Hoping the pain will subside soon. And within a week it did. I slept for 26 hours in total in that week. Because. I was an alcoholic again. Insomnia drove me nuts. My hands were constantly shaking. I felt like thousands and thousands of insects are roaming all over my body. I was addicted again.***

***When the pain stopped. I was back on track. But this time I thought I should stop with whisky. I should follow my rule 4 and shifted from whisky to wine. I thought maybe it was the alcohol concentration in whisky which caused the pain. Wine is diluted I will be fine. LOL dumb again.***

***When I started drinking wine. That was the time when my pancreas and pocket both suffered. Wine was expensive. Wine had low alcohol content. I had to drink more and more to become sane. By sane i mean, even a bottle of wine, a full big one was not even sufficient to get me to sleep. I was drinking 3 bottles of wine a day. I started fucking drinking in my own factory's office. I would bring the bottle in my office bag. During lunch. I would drink the wine straight from bottle very very very fast. I was scared someone might come. And then I would have lunch to get rid of the smell.***

***But when my pocket started suffering. I was back to whisky in no time. After spending a thousand dollars a month on wine I was done. But occasionally when my pockets were full I would drink wine. So I was back to whisky and a raging alcoholic. within no time. The pain started again. 24th November 2017. The pain started. My parents had gone out of town to my grandma's house. I was alone. I bought 3 halves of whisky. That's around a 1 litre. I started partying on 24th. I ate so much junk along with the whisky. NO LIMIT !!! I started experiencing a lot of pain on 25th. You know what I did. I drank even more. You might ask WHY? WHY DID I DRINK IN PAIN ? You know what my dumb idiot brain said to me. ""YOU ARE NOW IN PAIN. YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING. YOU STOP FROM TOMORROW NOW. DRINK TODAY. HARDCORE ALCOHOLIC THINKING. So I drank. I finished all the alcohol I bought. I drank in pain. First time the pain was so much that I could not get up from the bed to go piss. I pissed in a glass without leaving the bed. But my addiction level was so high. I drank and drank until I blacked out.***

***26th November 2017 morning 9:00am. My pain had crossed all bounds. I was laying in bed like a cocoon. Holding my abdomen with one hand and medicine in the other. I was again having an acute pancreatitis attack. The pain was excruciating. It felt like my pancreas would burst and i would die right now. I was covered in sweat in my cold room. My mind was numb. My eyes were red with tears. I was alone waiting for my parents to return. BUT THIS TIME SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT.***

Emotions are hard when you have to handle them sober. Getting dumped for quitting drinking really made me look at how every aspect of the last two years in that relationship were alcohol-induced. I could probably count on one hand the times I was 100% sober when we had sex that whole time....

Well, I reconnected with a mutual friend and we started hanging out. He is sober too, about half the time I have been also we both are fresh out of long term relationships. Dating sober is a refreshening, completely terrifying experience. Liquid courage.... oh yeah.... completely a thing. But being able to remember every aspect of your date and knowing you didn't embarrass yourself or move to quickly is an amazing feeling. 

Working out everyday has me feeling more and more confident about myself everyday. This new fling is really fun and he seems like a really cool dude. I know two newly sober people is pretty worrisome but I want him to actually know me and not the me that is drunk and overly-confident/touchy whatever person.

I've struggled with alcohol for years. Managed 14 months sober once. Generally I'm a drunk.

Needed surgery in March and managed to stay sober for the 2 months prior to it, per my surgeons request. (Minus 2 days...) Surgery was on the 11th of March and stuck with it until 4/7. An ambulance came to work that night for a C02 leak at our lab. The last time an ambulance came to work was when I tried to kill myself. It set me off. I've been drunk since that night in a mix of PTSD haze and self hatred. A few nights I was drinking half the bottle and showed up to work that night in a miserable state.

I know I shouldn't drink. Last Saturday was another half bottle sort of day. I moved up an appt with my psychiatrist to that Monday and knew I would disappoint him, plus I had run out so, I stopped drinking on Sunday. I've never, I guess to this extent, experienced withdrawals before. Anxiety beyond what I normally go through, GI issues, heart palpitations. Psych strongly urged me to go to the ER, and I'm like, yeah I gotta go to work that night, lol. 

So I go to work and sit down at my bench and the tiniest things are setting me off. I can't focus, I have this intense headache. Driving there I'm having these heart palpitations. My anxiety is on...an entirely new level. I'm terrified to be in the lab. Leave my bench to see my manager and just word vomit what's going on. I'm mortified. I tell her I'm an alcoholic. I tell her what my psych told me to do. I tell her I think I need to go to the hospital. I tell her how I've been drinking since the ambulance came to work. She is the kindest person I know, but I'm still so embarrassed.  

The ER wants to admit me but I'm terrified to be admitted after last June and the suicide attempt. What if they lock me up? What if they put me on a hold? I'm not thinking clearly, my BP when they get me hooked up on an EKG is 150/95 and my HR is hovering around 135. I'm losing my mind. They give me 5mg of valium and some vitamins to calm me down. I still refuse to be admitted. Who will take care of my cat? What about work? I pay $5 to park in the hospital garage and leave crying. 

My manager is very kind, but will not let me return to work until I have a fitness for duty form signed by a doctor, which is standard. So I'm seeing someone from my PCP's office Thursday morning. They are not counting these absences against me. Which is...again, extremely kind of them. I'm just embarrassed still. 

And I'm embarrassed because I love drinking. I know it has negative consequences. I've been on naltrexone for over a year. Hell, I drink on it. I don't go to AA, because the format bothers me, and Smart Recovery doesn't always work with my 3rd shift schedule. But I guess those are just excuses. How do I stop loving alcohol?

I was sober for 3 years. For some reason decided I was “over” that problem and wasn’t actually an alcoholic. Started drinking just a glass of wine at night with the wife.

Fast forward a year later. I’m drinking while driving, crash into the back of a truck, blow 3x over the limit, now I have a dui. I get out of jail after a few hours, go to the bar and drink. Sleep on a bench by the train station. Upon waking up throw myself on the tracks. 

I get pulled out quickly by helpful bystanders who help me call my wife. I come home and she threatens to leave out of state with our daughter. I swallow a fistful of Serequil (sp?) She calls ambulance and Iget admitted to a mental health facility.

I got out earlier today to find a note that my wife and daughter are indeed gone. Found the nearest open AA meeting and let it all out. Hopefully I can fix my life.

- I’ve drunk called and texted more people than have contacted me when they were drunk. I’m the worst of the bunch.
- I can’t have alcohol in my house. 
- I can’t hang out with people who drink.

Hi sober peeps. I've been a lurker on this sub for a while, and admire you all tremendously. 

I've been cutting back on drinking significantly, and decided to stop altogether for a number of reasons. I got to two weeks sober and I found out yesterday that my best friend/ex-boyfriend took his own life. I'm not handling it well, and not handling it sober. 

My main reason for getting sober is/was wanting to feel more present, conscious, and intentional about my life. Here is my question for you lovelies: who the fuck wants to feel completely present for something like this? My world makes absolutely no sense, and everything feels like it is falling apart. I have friends and family around me who are very supportive and loving, but I don't WANT TO FEEL all the feelings about this, which is why I'm numbing with alcohol/etc. I know that drinking isn't going to change anything, but it makes me feel a little less like the world just ended as I know it. I know that tomorrow, he will still be gone, but drinking makes that seem a little farther away.

Now while I don't do cocaine on a daily basis, I used to do it on a weekly basis and now whenever I drink I do coke. Everytime I drink I crave coke and I always get it. If I don't drink I don't want coke. And I find ways to hurt/shame myself. That happened late Saturday night/early Sunday morning. I HAVE to stop drinking, its already taken years of my life. I am 31 and I cannot bear this any longer. 

I was high and was going to kill myself after I took an uber to a prostitutes home. I entered the home and realized immediately I didn't want to be there. I apologized and walked out. the escort texted me my real name and that they know who I am She (a transfemale) said that I should come back, that I didn't pay. I felt threatened but I panicked and went back in. She insisted we go into the room and I complimented her on her looks (she could probably tell I was trying to save face) and said I am sorry but now that I am here I am not interested but I was scared because she knew my name ( I did not admit this to her) so I gave her the money. She then said she feels threatened and that I should leave. I immediately walked out. I called my older brother crying and begging for help. He rushed over and brought me home. The first step needed for me is sobriety. I hate how I let him and myself down. I have lost years of my life to this.

I cried to my brother he cried to me. Said how his life and my mothers life would be ruined if I ever hurt myself. He wants to help me be sober. I was on such a good path last few weeks and right when things get better I start using again and fuck everything up. That was my rock bottom.

My insecurities and dark thoughts are clouding my ability to sleep. I just took some benadryl to sooth the nerves but I won't feel it for about an hour. My sponsor hasn't responded yet, likely because it's so late, so I'm here. I struggle with anger. I felt like breaking something, I'm in therapy for it. It's helping because I didn't respond to it, I took some deep breaths and paced a little instead. I tried to wake my boyfriend, but luckily he's a hard sleeper so he didn't wake up. If he did, I would have questioned his feelings for me and that's not fair to him at all. So many nights I have caused horrible fights when I was blackout drunk, which has lead him to withdraw sexually, and he stopped saying he loves me, just says it back if I initiate it. If I say it in text, sometimes he won't respond. He tells me that this takes time to work through, and to be patient, and to understand that he's still by my side. Patience is tough when it's been less than a month sober for me and his trust for me has to be earned over time. I think I'm kind of rambling but it helps to type out my hurricane thoughts. I just feel so small and bad about myself that I'm projecting that he feels that toward me, too. It's so confusing to deal with emotions without drugs or booze clouding them. If I were to take a drink right now, I'd reset the trust clock and that's the last thing I want to do. It just sucks that I feel like I can't seem to get through the night without taking a sleep aide. I hope it gets better. I hope one day we can both be good again.

Would any of the folks here fortunate enough to be so far along your journey mind sharing some of the things you learned after the ""basics""?

For instance, I'm thankful every day that there is no more war being fought in my head. I never crave alcohol, don't mind being around it, and the only time I ever think about it is when it comes up in conversation. I have a *tiny* bit of frustration towards it in how much time I wasted in the bottle, but I'm not too hard on myself about it and I figure a healthy repulsion to the drink is much better than fighting off cravings. One thing I struggle with is that all that time I spent numbed, my brain wasn't learning. I missed out on about twenty years of building a solid set of coping skills, emotion-processing, etc. It manifests itself in noticeably sharper negative emotions, ones that aren't comparative to the situation in terms of magnitude.

Is this something that the mind figures out naturally over time? Any tips on actively building on it? What else did you wish you knew going into year two, three, five, ten? Is there something particularly challenging down the road?

Things have been amazing lately, and only getting better. I've been really enjoying growing with you all but there is one thing gnawing at the back of my mind. I'm going to talk to my therapist about it tomorrow, but I value the hell out of your guys' experiences so I wanted to get your input.


I want to ask if any of you have experienced imposter syndrome? I think I have a little bit of that creeping in.


I think I'm scared that things are going TOO well, that I'm getting over-confident and that eventually the other shoe is going to drop. It usually does, right? Or I burn out on it and crash? At least it seemed that way before I quit.


Other than bad thinking and self-sabotage habits (BPD is fun!) I think a lot of it is coming from the fact that I'm only 18 days in and it's the first time I've been this far since I can't remember when. It's not my first time trying, but it's my first time succeeding for this long, and I see you guys on here who have made it to 18 days many times, and much further, and still struggle, and still relapse. I know in my logical brain that that is not a bad thing! As long as you have the intent, and you're improving, and you don't give up, you are still succeeding, and I am still VERY proud of you. But in that (now quite small) anxious part of my mind I feel like it's not right for me to feel as sure of my continued sobriety as I am now. A part of me feels like I don't have the right to have things be getting this easy.

I'm also really glad that I could give some good advice yesterday on the check-in thread on healthy inner language, and I really enjoyed talking to you all! Logical brain knows that it doesn't matter where you are in your journey, if you've got something that will help someone then that's great! We all have different experiences, and I'm trying to remember not to compare myself to others, but I also feel like I have no business giving advice because I'm so new to it and that people taking my advice who are further along then me are wiser than me and are being tricked into listening to me or something. It's so ridiculous!

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** 

Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I should have had a journal for my lies to know which one I told to what person. I mean how many times does someone get pink eye *and* a migraine *and* the flu in a matter of weeks? I want to go on the record and say that I never actually had any of those. I also wasn’t ‘too busy’ to not make it to a social commitment. I was just a sloppy and unreliable flake who knew I wouldn’t show up when I originally agreed. Because I was drunk at home with all curtains closed and hiding from the world. I was in my own living hell.

Then I quit drinking and my overly inflated ego burst. I had to get honest and not only with myself. And there’s no doubt that honesty didn’t happen the day I quit. The severity and depth of my story came seeping out over a period of time. So, a lovely acronym, HOW. Am I being Honest, Open and Willing? How can I move forward, learn and be different? How can I be honest?!  I put a little reminder in my phone, TTT, Tell The Truth! It was overwhelming at first but as time went on I grew to be more comfortable with the truth and my hourly TTT reminders which remain on my phone to this day. I no longer have anything to hide. 

As I became more honest I started to develop a brand new concept that I had yet to experience in my adult life; self love and respect. Truly, when I was drinking I hated everything so much. I had very few nice things to say (or scream.) And I had no idea that I could actually love myself because deep down and for so long I hated myself so much. Self love didn’t happen in the blink of an eye either, it’s something I consciously work on daily. My brother who graciously held my hand the entire first 18 months of my sobriety used to tell me a minimum of five times a day “You just gotta love yourself!” Like always, he was eerily right. So I take care of myself now. I walk every day regardless of the weather, I shower, I work on my recovery and I do the things I was never able to do before. I have post it notes that say silly things like ‘You Are Amazing!’ and ‘Love Yourself!’ and after some time I started to believe it.

My elementary observation is simply this. Self-love, respect and honesty were practically unobtainable until I decided to take my life back. This journey without alcohol is incredible and it just gets easier and more enlightening. It really does. 

SD family, I so appreciate you and am so grateful for you! Show of hands- who loves themselves today?! And in what way can honesty free you? Or, how has quitting freed you? 

Some quotes...

“Self-love makes me vulnerable and compassionate towards others. It’s the balm for all wounds; it multiplies as it’s expressed. It can begin with my smile.” - Each Day A New Beginning (Karen Casey)

“Love yourself first, and everything else falls into line. You really have to love yourself to get anything done in this world.”- Lucille Ball

The ""pink clouds"" are gone, and now it's just me and my depression.","This is my longest stretch fully sober since I started drinking 20 years ago, at 13 years old. Since then I have not gone one solid, uninterrupted month without drinking and/or smoking weed. I had a different account here, but had to delete it when a friend found out it was mine. Too personal.

But I digress. The first few weeks of my sobriety were amazing. I was happier than I'd been in forever, motivated and full of energy, loving every minute of my new sober life and all it meant for my future. Saving money and losing weight without trying. Excited to rebuild long neglected relationships with friends and family. But the honeymoon phase is over, and now it's just me and my depression.

How do people just go through life without drinking? How do they tune out the noise emanating from all the assholes and ignorant people in the world? How do they do away with the overwhelming sadness of life? How do they cope with the stress of work and relationships, or avoid worrying too much about things they can't control?

I didn't come close to caving today. I still know it's not worth it, and I know that drinking or smoking would just send me deeper into the hole. But I need something to keep me going—some way to handle life like a fucking normal human being who isn't depraved and damaged beyond repair. Because that's what it feels like lately.",19,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.44462934}"

We had just put our first rescue mastiff Nikki down and  I was hell bent on never getting another mastiff. Nikki had neurological disorders and would attack people for no reason to the point every other dog had to be separated from her because she would attack them. This was my first experience with the breed and I didn’t want a repeat. 

At the time my wife worked at a vet clinic and someone brought this lively dog in to be fixed because a rescue saved him from euthanasia because he couldn’t be bred anymore. Coincidentally it was the same rescue that Nikki came from. I had just had a broken knee. I was 1 week back to work and on crutches. 

I get a text from my wife “hey can I rescue this dog.” I was on a call for work so I didn’t see it. One hour later I get this text “hey so I already signed the papers we have a week to decide. I promise I will make it up to you.” I got pissed. Absolutely furious. 

I walked into our living room and saw this giant head peeking over the couch with the derpiest smile you have ever seen and I fell in love with Leo. He was a huge part of our family ever since. 

We rescued another mastiff who turned out to be from the same place as Leo who may have been his sister they got so excited to see each other and we couldn’t foster Lydia anymore.  We failed at our first foster. 

In January we found out Leo had lung cancer and did not have much time. We tried our absolute best to extend his life and make him happy and comfortable so he could maybe pass in his sleep at home. It didn’t happen. Today we made the call and took him to the vet. I went in the kitchen tonight and saw his kennel and Lydia laying in his kennel instead of her own and it crushed me. 

Today I was there for my wife who needed me more than ever. I wasn’t hungover I’m not drunk now. I was strong for her all day. So instead of drinking and getting hammered I am processing my feelings as I should. 

It’s been a rough day. I’m exhausted physically and mentally. I can’t sleep I’m so sad. Leo isn’t hurting anymore and I hope he’s having a good time wherever he is. It was good to say goodbye to an old friend today and remember all of it. IWNDWYT hug your fur babies tonight instead.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4825334}"

Homemade pasta sauce, folding fresh basil gently into onions, garlic, vibrant tomatoes. Good quality local meat browning, that I bought right before dinner because I was sober and able to drive. A candle glows, I put on a podcast. Stretch while I'm cooking. Clean dishes as I dirty them; there's room in the sink because I keep my kitchen clean now. My boyfriend is laying in the other room, reading a book - I hear him laugh out loud to himself at points and it makes me smile. I feel no panic at trying to mask the sound of a bottle opening or a beer can being popped, no deceit and shame of trying to justify the amount of wine disappearing ""because I used it in the sauce."" No terror that he might walk in and catch me swigging manically from the bottle. No hiding my wine glass behind the spice rack.

The most mundane things are the ones I am most grateful for in sobriety. For a long time, my drinking meant that I was literally almost going to catch my house on fire on a daily basis. My boyfriend would be skeptical if I said I was going to cook, fearful even. Burners would be left on. The amount of times I fell asleep with a candle burning or with a pizza slowly hardening into charcoal in the oven still scares me to think about. I constantly had burn marks and open sores on my wrists from sloppy drunk cooking. I broke glassware. And of course, I barely ever ate - all that for nothing! I would always be too buzzed from slurping down wine that by the time dinner was ready, I was good and drunk and not interested in the food I had prepared.

TLDR; Personal rEfLeCtIoN of my JoUrNeY before and after alcohol

It feels like an entire lifetime ago when I was drinking. I lived alone and it was easy to hide from people around me. My life was controlled by alcohol- do I have enough to drink? Do I need to buy more? What store should I go to today so the cashiers don't start recognizing me as the box wine lady? (Some did anyway- looking at you CVS manager). There were so many breaking points- begging friends for $20 because I couldn't go a night without and I drank through my savings, living surrounded by empty containers too drunk and lazy to clean up after myself, stealing and sneaking alcohol from family and friends, trying to lose weight with half my daily calories being from alcohol- but the last straw was when I couldn't get a simple prescription for birth control to help treat my PCOS. Nothing fancy- just the regular old pill. I was refused at multiple doctor's offices because my liver enzymes were 10x the maximum normal limit. Everything that could help me was metabolized through the liver and therefore off limits.

I started counting my drinks, because while I could tell if I had enough for one night by ""weighing"" my box of wine, I had no idea how much I was drinking. I was embarrassed and ashamed- I didn't want to try anything with a group. I started seeing a therapist who I am so grateful supported my journey not going down the AA route. I really don't know how to explain it- one day I just got pissed off at everything that alcohol was doing to me and everything it was keeping me from. Every day was never the right day- but that one day I threw out what was left of my wine and bought a lot of beer and started tapering. There were days when I could tell I went too fast because my anxiety was through the roof. I had more panic attacks than I had in a long time. But I was just so angry and done with alcohol. My body had forgotten how to fall asleep. For years I just passed out every night. I found eating right before bed and exercise helpful in those first few days.

I always had this idea that I could drink again someday... just not anytime soon. And that was kind of comforting (and probably not recommended but it worked for me). Alcohol had been such a big part of my life and I romanticized it a lot- how can you say goodbye to something that you love forever? I still have that mindset, but my idea of ""someday"" has been pushed out from 30 days to 90 days to a year to maybe 10 years. I remember how shit I felt, how I felt like I was wasting my life, so tired of the cycle of buying and drinking and feeling guilty and ashamed and repeating it every single night.

I have grown so much in my sobriety and I am so proud of myself. I feel like I have been in a really secure place with alcohol for a while now. I still have those days... but I've learned the situations and people that put me at a disadvantage and how to combat that. I was never a therapy person before, but I found that those biweekly check ins are great for maintaining some semblance of sanity. I told the people in my life that I was newly sober... which painfully involved admitting to them that I had a problem for years. I've never gone to AA before, and I still don't know if I will. Maybe I'll try an in person meeting- while I feel comfortable with my sobriety, I'm at a point where I would really like some community or sober friends who understand what it's like.

Anyway, if you made it this far I am very appreciative of you. I only recently joined this community and it warms my heart to see so many people taking positive steps for themselves. For everyone reading this who is sober, I am so proud of you and your accomplishment. And for folks who aren't, I send love and strength to push yourself to the next step in your journey- whatever that may be. There is no one path or one size fits all approach. I hope this obnoxiously long post is proof of that

I went a few weeks sober a few months ago, again, thought I was awesome, but I remember KNOWING that I was just trying to lower my tolerance so I could get wasted sooner the next time I drink. Well, I did, then again, and again, and it completely sucked. But I kept going. 

Then April fools came around and I was like, I'm absolutely disgusted by this. I hate it, drinking. I started talking to the booze like he was this a-hole, idiot, liar that no one pays any attention to but he keeps showing up, annoying me, poking me, tempting me to do stupid stuff.

 I got out my pen and started writing. Wrote a little everyday, mostly journaling (not really a pen, it's on my phone)... writing how I'm feeling, stuff I'm mad about, happy about, whatever. It was weird, I just....stopped. Stopped drinking. Dealt with the physical, really focused on the mental and emotional. Then, I see this article, about you all, in this StopDrinking community. 

So, I'm writing here too. In the past I didn't have much of an outlet, did a lot of therapy in person (amazingly helpful and transformational), but nothing spontaneous, like this. 

So, if you don't mind, I'll do some spontaneous writing, expressing my open and honest feelings here, random as they may be. I already feel empowered. That d-head booze is over there begging me for attention but I just told him, back off a-hole, I'm writing, then I'm going to go to sleep and wake up feeling like a friggen clear headed, rested, sober super hero that I have become without your boozy ""help"" you always promised. So, TBNT. 

Seriously, waking up clean is awesome. I think my face is cleaner? My knee doesn't hurt. My arms don't fall asleep while sleeping. I actually sleep now too, which I rarely did, always tossing, turning, swearing at myself and the world. 

April has been a really good month. One day at a time. Good, positive things, and people are coming my way... A couple old friends called me out of the blue. So, I called a couple other old friends out of the blue. I think they did the same. That made me feel pretty good. 

So, that's what's working for me today. I'll keep checking in with you all. Is it weird that I feel like we already know each other? I feel like this is a very friendly, kind, patient place to be. I feel the love. Thank you for that, sincerely. Thank you also for listening. Sending you all love.",57,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.41947514}"

What you guys say is so helpful and I'm sure there are a lot of people like me who read and get strength without joining.  Thank you for sharing.  But I have a question I haven't seen yet.  Sorry if I just missed it.  Here's my story and my question. 

July 4  2001 I took a long weekend after the 4th.  I had binged the occasional weekends and holidays before that since college and had been able to stop when I needed to (or maybe I just thought) so I didn't think that July 4th week would be any different.  My wonderful girlfriend who I figured I'd marry went to a family thing.  She begged me to come with her but I worked a stressful IT job and I just wanted some down time so I stayed home.  I guess maybe she recognized what I didn't.  I had just turned 30 and had a successful career and a wonderful girlfriend and bought whatever toys I wanted and I figured I was going to conquer the world.  

I don't remember much about that week after the morning of the 4th.  And something different happened.  I didn't stop drinking after that week.  I didn't get drunk every night but most nights I needed to at least get a buzz when I got home.  I didn't consider it a problem and rationalized it because I had a stressful job.  

Long story short.  Over the last 20 years I lost my girlfriend and blew other later relationships, never had kids, have no family to speak of.  I lost my high paying job about ten years ago but was able to put together enough contract work until COVID gut punched us all.  I haven't worked in about a year and my savings are almost gone.  I rent and my landlord who has been very good to me and kept the rent locked over the past five years needs to raise the rent to cover his expenses so I'll be out in two months with no idea where to go.  In the past I tried stop drinking and relapsed more times than I care to count.  But this time it's different.  I'm far from perfect and honestly I succumb and have a drink but don't get drunk every week or two but there is something very different this time about it and I feel in control for the first time in almost 20 years.  

And this is where my question comes in.  Because I'm not drinking every day I am not numb.  For the first time in almost 20 years I feel.  And it hurts like hell.  It really hurts like hell.  Today I curled up on my bed and pretty much cried all day.  I look at everything I've lost and can't ever get back.  No wife, no kids, no house, no career, no job opportunities and now no idea where I'm going to live in two months.  Family members who suffered because I wasn't there to help take care of them.  All because of my drinking.  

I realize we're in a crazy world right now and I'm not the only one in a crappy situation in life.  I may be one of the few however who is directly responsible for how I got here.   And I now I have to face up to my reality and my bleak future while not being numb.  I often wake up now and scream inside when I realize where I am in my life and what I have done.  I'm not so concerned about my drinking because I have people IRL who are helping me with that.  My question is that I don't know how to deal with the pain and guilt of what I have done going forward.

My entire life has changed & I’m feeling so much better. I don’t desire alcohol. Don’t even really think about it much. My friends drink but I don’t care. We still hang out & do stuff but I’m not a daily bar fly anymore. If I go, my drink of choice is sweet tea. After 15 years of drinking every day, I really feel that I am so done with it. Took my money, my brain cells, some friends & caused me to make the worst decisions on the planet. My life is very calm & peaceful now. I work hard to keep everything handled as much as I can, which leads to way less stress. To all of you out there struggling, it can be done! It only feels weird for the first year. I chalked it up to my brain needing time to revert back to the proper biochemistry. Glad it didn’t take 15 years to undo it!

When the booze ran out and I was continuously waking up at midnight just to roll around for hours then sleep through the next day I told myself to get a fucking grip.

I've been haunting this sub for over 1.5 years now, and have realized this is my best bet for a sober community now that I've officially made a commitment to myself to make this my last time counting days.  It feels like I should finally introduce myself officially-- I'll try to be brief. 

I've gone through my share of vices to cope with trauma and mental illness and have gradually kicked almost all of them. Alcohol crept in after my divorce from my abusive first husband 5 years ago, with whom I'd spent almost the entirety of my 20s. I went from a casual drinker to waves of binging and nightly drinking that landed me in a lot of tenuous, even dangerous situations.

The last 3 years of my life have miraculously been the best I've ever had. I've remarried to an amazing partner who supports me and gives me space to grow on my own, started a brand new career path that I love, bought a new house and more. And yet, despite putting an end to most of my self-destructive partying and binge drinking, my drinking quietly and insidiously became a nightly affair, climbing to 7-9 drinks a night before I knew what was happening.

I finally hit a point where I realized that, where I'd started drinking heavily as a way to numb myself enough to stay alive, alcohol was now the primary source of my woes-- one of the last bastions in my 15+ yr slow uphill climb toward mental health. I would have little to regret in life now, if it weren't for all of the hangovers, aggravated anxiety and depression, tearful and incoherent conversations I can't remember with my husband, drunk interactions with my stepchildren, etc. Life isn't perfect, but drinking is definitely not doing anything for me anymore. 

My husband still drinks nightly, and is supportive but a bit wary of me quitting-- partly because I've said I was quitting many times in the last year, since my first 100 days came to an end in April 2020, partly because his ex was an alcoholic who stumbled between AA and blackout constantly (and who found god 10 years into their marriage, changing the dynamic drastically), and partly because he feels guilty continuing to drink around me, as if he's rubbing it in (his words). I've told him that for now I feel strongly that I don't want to ask him to get rid of booze on my account, but that there may come a day that I do need it out of the house or at least hidden. He's supportive of that. 

Ultimately I just don't have any sober friends in my life. I don't have any crabs/pushers around me either, which is nice, but I crave a sober tribe. I've been involved in various 12 Step programs in the past, and while they did some immensely good things for me in some of my darkest days, it ultimately isn't my scene, and the language of addiction as a disease doesn't work for me personally. 

Thank you to those who are still with me (what can I say, brevity has never been a strength of mine), and thank you to everyone who makes up this community and sticks with it. I hope we can be in each others' lives like this for a long time.",7,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46017766}"

I hope this beautiful day (at least it is so here in the southeastern US) is going well for everyone. I wanted to say hello, as Im new to this community, and introduce myself in the hopes of gaining advice and accountability from this group. For context:  Im a 35-year male that has realized in the past 72 hours my drinking is going to cost me more than I can afford to lose if I don't get myself under control. I have a great job, a loving/supportive family, and a beautiful partner that is all at risk of being lost due to my inability to control myself when I binge drink. I never really thought I had a problem even though both sides of my family tree suffer heavily from alcoholism. I always thought my drinking was normal, in fact healthy, compared to what I was used to seeing growing up. I get conflicting answers when it comes to the feasibility of quitting ""cold turkey"" but if Im going to prove to someone that I love them more than my ""good times"" out drinking then I have to try. My request for advice right now is this; what does everyone do when that trigger appears. For me, it's at its worst around 5:00 in the afternoon on Fridays. Im in sales and I won't blame my urges on the stressful nature of the job because I usually don't have a single drink throughout the week. The problem is when I start at happy hour I literally turn into ""frank the tank"" from the movie Old School. I've tried in the past to ignore the urge but after a week or even more of good behavior, I always find myself ""shit-faced"" drunk barhopping at 1:30 in the am after going out for a drink or two after work. I know the first important step is to realize you want to change but what's next for someone in my position? How has anyone here successfully beaten the bad habits and overcome the destructive patterns? I know these are heavy and loaded questions. Im beginning individual therapy to complement our couples therapy but not sure what else I can use to help me create this change. I hope I didn't overlook a post answering this and appreciate anyone's time helping me answer some of these questions as I start my journey to sobriety and a healthier lifestyle.

It hasn’t happened consciously, but behind the scenes, in my unconscious, almost as if by hypnosis, I’ve become completely disgusted by the idea of alcohol. Not sure how or why it happened, but anytime I think of drinking, I get a visceral nausea, as if I were about to vomit. I think with enough distance, my unconscious mind has accepted alcohol for what it truly, really, actually is: poison.


Every time I see media try to portray alcohol as a fun, lovely thing that healthy, active people do it just seems so phony to me. It isn’t real. And I believe that now, I KNOW it to be true.

Just thought I’d share that development. I know when I first got sober I wondered if it was possible to do it forever. It always seemed impossible to me - eventually, I always thought, I’ll be able to drink. Somehow, some way, I’d find my way back to it. To you, I say, just wait. Wait patiently, live your life well, enjoy everything that sobriety has to offer that alcohol never did. Eventually your unconscious mind will buy what your reality is selling: the truth that Alcohol sucks. It really, really does. It just might take some time for you to believe it.

I quit last Oct but then rescinded the next day after talking with manager/HR, he knew something was up with me and after that I did reach out and talked to a therapist for a few sessions. But she didnt work for me and I went back to drinking for the last 5 months. 

Drinking has held me back from moving to something new. That and the good paycheck that paid for all the drinking and random shit Ive wasted money on (and wasted apt rent, couldnt bought a house by now smh). Drinking has prevented me to even decide what kind of job/career I would rather be doing. Drinking has stopped me from being a good friend and reclusive. Drinking has stopped me from being with or seeking out a partner. Drinking has turned me into a boring, lonely, depressed person. Drinking has led to me not experiencing life.

I just dont know what to do, what I want to do, or where to go from here. I feel stuck on repeating the same day/week.

Saturday was the final straw for my SO. While we are not officially calling it quits, but we are not living together anymore.

I have to work hard again to get back coding skills. Some of my family members were murdered and I didn't deal with it properly I believe. I went to a psychiatrist, I'm on my way up from the hole I'm currently in.

Over the winter I drank more than a moderate amount pretty much every day. In previous years/seasons usually just a moderate amount (being a bottle of wine 6 or so days a week). Never blacked out or did anything dangerous like drunk driving. My housemates and friends were concerned at the amount I was drinking so is stopped for a while earlier this year. It was difficult and scary, with light/moderate withdrawls symptoms. Def took a while to get ""sleep"" again. After being sober for a bit I was amazed to feel not hung over. I realized that I have been living my life in a perpetual hangover which is maybe why I never noticed being hungover because it was a constant. 

Recently I slowly started drinking more and more, starting with just a drink or two which turned into a bottle of wine/equivalent a night (less than was drinking earlier in the winter) . After a solid week or so of drinking a bottle of wine/equivalent a night I felt sick of drinking both physically and otherwise. I was drinking to get drunk and not to enjoy the drink or even enjoying being drunk. So I cut myself off from it. After only a few days sober I am amazed at the lack of brain fog. 

TLDR
Because I've never hurt anyone or myself and my history is pretty moderate/benign I feel like i would be an imposter going to meetings and involve a lot of heavy stuff/stories that I wont really relate too.  That being said I do feel like I want some help and structure. I assume i should talk to my primary care provider? Some kind of therapy? New to adulting. 

I think I would enjoy some kind of workbook/routine even if it isnt explicity for addiction. Any recs or threads thst cover this would be great.

But still, I've drank less this past year than I have in any previous year since I was 19. Every time I find myself taking a step back I bounce back stronger. Every slip up is still monumentally less horrific than the one previously because the alcohol isn't the only thing in control anymore.

Good morning beautiful people! 

This morning I have been feeling weird, and I realized it’s because I had a drinking dream last night. 3+ years sober, and I still get them and they always feel SO REAL. Down to the part in the dream where I tell myself “you gotta reset your badge, honey”. 

However, the last year for me has been one of deep healing. I have been diagnosed with cptsd & I struggle to this day with OCD related behaviours I exhibit (especially intrusive thoughts) and every day i work toward healing and feeling safe. 

An intrusive thought for me looks like this… I might be in the shower, and I have a glimpse of a sharp object in the corner of my eye and the intrusive thoughts says “be careful you don’t slip and accidentally fall on that with your neck”. Or if I am cleaning the sink, and I turn the garbage disposal on… I have to tell myself “honey, do not put your hand in there.” 

I just realized that these dreams are very similar to intrusive thoughts, and to me that is very comforting… And let me explain why. I’ve learned that intrusive thoughts happen only because we are so worried about the opposite thing happening. Safety is literally such a priority for me, that I have these intrusive thoughts that scare me… But it’s just my brain‘s way of trying to keep me safe. On the flipside of that, sobriety is so freaking important to me that I have these intrusive dreams about breaking it. 

So instead of looking at that dream as a weird failure, I’m going to look at it as proof that sobriety means the world to me. I hope this stream of consciousness reaches someone that might also find it helpful while learning to cope!

I'm a 21 year old gal about to graduate college finally, and I'm one month sober today. My longest streak was 75 days over the winter, but school stress sent me spiraling into a constant reset-rinse-repeat cycle until I ended up bingeing every night for over a week. That's when I finally admitted to myself that I was an alcoholic, not just a binge-drinking party fiend.

It's really hard to change your life. I'm sure you all know this. I think the hardest part for me has been becoming the adult woman I was always meant to be, yet also realizing that I was this completely different person for the first 3 years of my early adulthood. And there's a lot of cringe, trauma, embarrassment, shame, and heartache from those years. There were things I did to myself, and things others did to me when I was at my weakest. It's hard to even recognize the person I was pre-covid. I hope with enough work, I can get to a place of acceptance of my shadow and the lessons I had to learn to get me here.

Alcohol trapped me in place. I was a legal adult with the mind and behavior of a scared 17 year old, desperate for love and acceptance, pretending to be the person I thought I had to be to get the most out of life. Since lockdown, I've slowly began to face myself. I've had to be honest for the first time in a long time. I've crawled and scraped my way back to myself. I've grown up. It wasn't just alcohol; it never is! Alcohol was just a symptom of a broader issue. The core of the problem was that I never learned how to love myself properly, and how to stand strong on my own. I thought love was something you needed to find, receive, or fight for, but it was really something I had to grow and nurture inside of myself, all along.

Anyways. Hopefully after I graduate I can find a sober tribe where I can make these kinds of announcements. Until then, I hope this finds all of you well. I will not drink with you today!!

We all know the story, mine isn't any different.  Planning the next time I can drink during the day.  Abusive relationship with alcohol.  Can't have just one.  Sneaking drinks, or lying about how many I've had.  All of these things far too familiar to me.

Maybe I wasn't in the extreme levels that some people have reached, but I'm ashamed enough of how much I drank that I don't really ever talk with anyone about it, even my closest family or friends.  I thank my wife and son for at least keeping me from letting my problems get too out of control when I was drinking.  I thank them again for giving me reason to end my abusive relationship with alcohol.  Finding a support network is important - and I think that this sub is a great network to help talk things through or give pause to think about other's experiences.

They say counting days is what an alcoholic does.  But after resetting my badge over and over for the last 2 years, I think I have finally found my re-starting point, and I'm going to stick with it.  I don't have a lot of wisdom to spread.  Each person has to find their own reasons to improve their quality of life.  Drinking culture (especially here in Wisconsin) is cancerous and far too ingrained in everyday life that I couldn't see that there was even a problem for a long time.  Just remember, if you have thoughts about quitting, it's probably long past time to try and stop.

It’s dealing with everything else sober that’s complicated. 

This is true for me at least. 

Not drinking is just a yes/no choice about a certain kind of liquid that I make over and over. Simple. Not easy but not something I think about much because I know how to make yes/no decisions. 

Handling stress, anxiety, pain, boredom, etc without my familiar crutch is freaking difficult. There’s not an easy yes/no option. And dealing with life is extra hard for me because I don’t know how to do it without some kind of escape. 

This isn’t what I expected. I thought not drinking would be hard but would make my life easy. Kind of the opposite seems to be true. 

I almost had a drink yesterday because I didn’t feel like I could handle my stress without one. Well guess what. Apparently I can handle my stress. It doesn’t feel good but it won’t destroy me. I can ride it out and wake up on the other side of it. I’m stronger than I thought. 

Every time I’m successful at choosing not to drink when I want an easy escape I learn something. It’s hard and it’s uncomfortable but I think it’s valuable. This might be the hardest and most important thing I’ve ever done for myself. 

And now I want to keep going, stay sober longer. I want to keep choosing ‘no’ until life feels easier because I’ve got better tools to handle it with.

Prior to this, I’d never really had a problem with drinking. I liked alcohol, my body hated it. But the last year or so I’ve noticed a change in my regular drinking. I drink very rarely during the week, but will have a big night one or two weekends a month. I do dry January - and regularly don’t drink for a few weeks. 

I’ve never had issues with blacking out. I’ve always been the “memory bank” for everyone. But the last 6 months especially, I’ve blacked out about 30% of the times I have drank. I have no idea why or what’s changed. I’m having huge anxiety waves the next day and my heart pounds. I drink about 10-15 standard drinks on a big night, but that has always been my thing. 

In the last 2 months I’ve blacked out 3 times. But I’ve also noticed I’ve been getting really angry/upset for no real reason. My husband has noticed the change too. It’s also starting to affect our normal weekend tasks and enjoyment. I can’t get out of bed for at least a day after a big drink - the hangover lasts days.

Last weekend - I blacked out big time. I remember having drinks with my husband at the bar around 10pm then I woke up in bed. I had a very sore back. Couldn’t for the life of me remember what happened.
My husband told me i wanted to go to a bar but they wouldn’t let me in. He said I fell backwards off a gutter on a very busy main road of my town and landed on my back on the road. I could have hit my head, could of died - but I have ZERO recollection of this. I could tell by his tone he was upset. I’ve been too scared to ask what actually happened. 

I’m scheduled for surgery this week which means I have to stop drinking. Think it’s time to make this thing a long term thing.

Sorry for the rant - I’m still too ashamed to talk to my husband about it and felt like I needed to get the shame off my chest.

Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

KISS: Keep It Simple ~~Stupid!~~

Or Keep It Simple Sweetheart! Or the more politically correct term might now be Keep It Short n’ Simple. The slogan of all slogans. I grew up hearing, “KISS! Keep it simple, don’t overthink it, simplify!” I was like, “Whaaa?”

It has taken quite a bit of time but I’ve been learning that I don’t need to create additional chaos to feel alive or excited because simplicity is freeing as hell. Simplicity is serenity. I don’t have to make mountains out of molehills anymore. I’ll admit, keeping it simple is attainable but was sometimes elusive when I was treading through the murky waters of the early days of my new life.

To keep it simple I go back to basics with a few rules. If I’m overwhelmed I say to myself “if it takes less than 5 minutes then just do it.” Or I use the 5 second rule when I’m having a conversation. I wait 5 seconds before I open my huge blabber mouth or shoot a text. I try to listen (this can be challenging.) But it works! I have to apply the 24 hour rule all the time. Occasionally I’ll get a text that doesn’t sit well with me because I’m a bit sensitive. Rather than abruptly blurting out something bitchy I’ll sit on it for 24 hours (this can also be very challenging!) Sometimes by taking a step back and simply breathing or taking a few minutes to meditate allows me to grasp reality and react appropriately. If I’m having a not so fantastic day I’ll shorten my chances of making it worse by doing something nice for myself and I’ll simply go to bed early. 

Speaking of going to bed early, when I quit drinking my sleep, body and mind had a bit of regulating to do. Hello emotions, La Croix and carrot cake. I’d go to bed at 7 pm and get up bright eyed and bushy tailed at 4 in the morning. I’d start sending emails and I wondered if the recipients assumed I was drunk and hadn’t yet gone to bed from the night before (but IDGAF I was sober!) Then I’d drink coffee with my dogs and watch the sun to come up and hope that it was appropriate to start making phone calls by 6:15 am. My colleagues didn’t appreciate my new sobriety gig as much as I did, lol. I kept it really short and simple. Those simple, sober mornings are something I’ll never forget. It was like being brand new. So there’s no harm in taking an extra shower or walk and calling it a night. It’s just 24 hours, that’s all we have. 

Today I’ll KISS by recognizing that I can only do what I can do today. I can’t check everything off of my ongoing To-Do list but I can highlight a few things. I’ll KISS and simply enjoy the gift of a sober day. But to totally simplify, the only thing I really have to do today is not drink. 

Lastly, welcome and high-five to anyone here on Day 1, I’m glad you found this cool lil nook of the interwebs. Welcome back to everyone else who’s here rockin and rollin in their early days. I’m loving all of your comments, honesty and kindness. In case you need to hear this today, I’m so fucking proud of you. 

So, is there something you can do today to simplify your life? How can you KISS?

“A little simplification would be the first step toward living, I think.”- Eleanor Roosevelt

“One of the conclusions I have come to in my old age is the importance of living in the ever-present now. In the past, too often I indulged in the belief that somehow or other tomorrow would be brighter or happier or richer.”- Ruth Casey

2021-04-27 00:05:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mzg2ig/book_and_movie_tuesday/,Book and Movie Tuesday,"Hellllllooooooo fellow Sobernauts!


As I mentioned in last week's post, I think about my sobriety/recovery _a lot_ and try to learn lessons from whatever entertainment I'm consuming.  Well, this week I accidentally started reading a paranormal romance series.  And I learned a few things.

For fiction, I tend to stick to sci-fi and fantasy and can't get enough of apocalypse stuff either, and so I picked up a series based in New Mexico (the state in which I grew up) that starts with 99.8% of the population dying mysteriously.  _Just_ enough of a premise that I figured I'd give the series a try, thinking it was a fantasy series.  

But after the first 60 or so pages, _nothing_ seemed to be happening.  It was when an ""unexpectedly handsome"" new character was introduced that I began to wonder if I'd strayed into an unfamiliar genre.  A few pages later, when the female protagonist starting feeling thrills at the sight of broad shoulders, I realized that this series was not going to deliver on my favorite topics of starships or deep magicks.

I ditched it, but I had a couple takeaways from my short stay:

1) SO. MUCH. TALK. ABOUT. WINE. <trigger warning>

Ugh.  This drove me nuts.  The author spent _pages_ discussing the protagonist selecting a random wine, searching for a bottle opener, pouring a modest glass, sipping it and feeling the warmth ease through her body, pairing it with a meager meal, sipping it delicately between bites.  And then...putting a stopper in the bottle and saving the rest for tomorrow's dinner?  What?

There's a stocked wine cellar where the protagonist is holed up.  Our handsome stranger even comes bearing two bottles of New Mexico's finest when he shows up at the door.

The slow, unfamiliar pacing of the book had thrown me a bit, but this wine nonsense took me out of the book.  It was so...well...romanticized!  If what the author describes about the protagonist's thoughts and interactions with alcohol are realistic, they certainly don't reflect _my_ reality with alcohol.

Sipping wine?  Ha!  I wouldn't have bothered with the glass.  Fully stocked wine cellar in the basement?  I'd have grabbed a bottle opener and disappeared down there.  Stranger bearing wine?  Sorry, he'd have found my wine-soaked corpse in the basement.  And, if I were somehow still alive, I'd be more interested in the booze he carried than the beefcake.

2) The handsome male character was _insanely_ empathetic when he spoke.  Dude's supposed to be a young 20s guy and yet he always knew just what to say to acknowledge, support, and soothe the protagonist's feelings.  Unbelievable.  Literally.

But, in my recovery, expressing compassion and empathy is a skill I'm working on developing.  I see a lot of great examples of compassion around here in our community.  This compassion was what helped me get sober to begin with.  And it seems like it needs to start on the inside.

I have a hard time dealing with my own feelings of discomfort, ambivalence, and pain.  I used to try to drown them with booze and, even sober, I often push them away.  

So, I end up doing the same thing when confronted with other's feelings.  I minimize, I dismiss, I argue back.  Super-duper not helpful and definitely not the kind of compassionate response I value around here.

Soooooo, lots of work for me to do in this arena.  There's a small part of me that wonders if I shouldn't slog through a few more books in this series to see if I can learn a thing or two about empathy from this broad-shouldered, tall, dark, and handsome man.  But I imagine I'll encounter pages where the protagonist feels flush from two sips of wine or how they take some wine on a picnic or something.  And that will just take me out of the story.

I mostly stopped for health reasons and to feel more in control of my life because I could occasionally have too much to drink before social functions to quell anxiety (don't do this, it always backfires). I feel like I really thought it through and I don't feel guilty or anything like that. I sort of had this planned for a week or so.

So, while my mom has told me before that she was proud of me, this time felt different. It was like I could feel her soul smiling. My brother told my mom that I quit drinking(We were attending a wedding when I told him). Mom said he was bothered by it, but she was over the moon. So nevertheless, I feel at peace with myself, for myself, and I hope that my brother will understand. 

I come from a long line of drinkers on both sides of my family. I have the taste for alcohol. I had to repeatedly tell my brother I quit drinking as he tried to place a beer in my hand. It was like what I was saying was not registering, it did not compute. Then came the look of befuddlement. He congratulated me but it was as if he didn’t know know me anymore. 

I hope that I can set a new example for him, the right example, I should have done long ago. I hope that this will not create an awkward divide. I plan on having a discussion with him soon. I just want him to know that I am the same person he’s always known, just a better happier version.

Every time I felt/feel a craving, I just join an online meeting. (There is ALWAYS a meeting going on) -- **I think a lot of what makes sobriety difficult is how alone you feel in the beginning**. I drove by patio bars seeing people smiling and drinking and immediately felt so alone, like everyone else is still drinking and its just me sober..doesn't help that all of my friend group still drink like fish.. it feels like its just you.. but then you go to a meeting and you see 100 other people in there and feel at HOME. No judgement and you can freely vent about your drinking without being side eyed. They get it.

The god stuff is cheesy as hell for me though. I do try to focus on the ""higher power"" viewpoint, but damn it, don't WE deserve some credit? ""God"" didn't help me stay sober.. I DID. AA DID. I deserve the pat on the back, not ""god"".. just my two cents. Give yourself some credit! You don't go to the gym and get abs and say ""GOD IS THE REASON I HAVE ABS!"" No, YOU did the hard work!!! Anyway..

I am a VERY anxious person. Well, at least I thought I was. **Who would have known that literally 90% of my anxiety was a direct symptom to my alcoholism**. Not only that, but not looking forward to my next binge session and instead being able to look forward to all of the little moments in life that I was ignoring before is incredible. There are little pieces of happy in every day.

I now find joy in that first sip of coffee, my cats doing something cute/funny, a good conversation with a friend, that dopamine dump after a good workout, tea on the patio watching my cats bird watch and wiggle their butts wishing they were talented enough to catch one (lol), Jamming out after work in the car with the windows down because the weather is finally getting nice.. so many things I was too distracted to really enjoy before.

My life was just  *-- Buy a bottle of vodka.. drink 90% of it.. fight with boyfriend..cry..pass out.. feel like shit.. cry.. regret..repeat --* WHY..? Simple, **alcohol is addicting as fuck and tricked me into thinking I was having fun.**

I woke up this morning with some wisdom, and here it is;

# You will never regret not drinking.

I am so proud of myself and looking back on this month, **I have lost out on NOTHING.**

Benefits so far;

\- I am down 9 lbs  
\- I feel genuine happiness over the little things  
\- My relationship has improved. My boyfriend and I have not even as much as bickered since we both stopped.  
\- Sex is surprisingly even better  
\- I sleep like a fuckin baby  
\- I am kicking ass at work, my bosses bosses boss complimented me the other day on my numbers, which is HUGE!!!!!  
\- M O N E Y -- I have some cushion!! I can't believe it!  
\-My skin looks amazing  
\- So much extra free time -- I completed a TON of projects around the house and I even read a few books,  
\- I feel very ""good"" (can't explain it) after a meal.

I do worry about social situations, but I mean.. I see my friends once a month these days with our work schedules being so different.. I am planning a tea party for my and my friends! Complete with hors d’ oeuvre and good music and my cats. I cannot wait!

Thank you guys for everything, and especially r/cripplingalcoholism \-- that sub is my anti-drink. Just read some posts in there.. some are relatable to the dark side we all seem to have, and the other is a reminder of why the fuck I stopped in the first place.

The paramedic checked me out and said I need to go to the hospital but I stubbornly refused. I said they can't make me do anything (fuck, a neighbor just came by to drop off flowers, spectacle confirmed). Anyway I finally agreed to let my wife take me to the hospital so we could wrap up the party and get off the porch.

I have no recollection of time or events between those two moments. I'm beyond embarrassed, ashamed and disgusted by my selfish shitbag behavior. Fortunately I somehow won the spousal lottery and am married to the most amazing woman on the planet who stands by me and supports me through all this.

Overall trying to quit and trying to be the better version of myself already helped me enormously.

I've gone two week or so before without a drink. But since before my second child (five years) I don't remember going almost four week stone sober. 

There is a song by Mt Joy called *Astrovan*. The line that has haunted me is **Every addict has illusions.** Sobriety was my illusion. Every hang over, every shitty night. All the nights I writhed in my sleep, drenched in a cold, drunk sweat. I promised myself never again. I'm never drinking again. And yet I would go a day or two, feeling fine. Come the weekend or a Tuesday (always a Tuesday, it's pizza night) I would convince myself one or two weren't the problem.

The last four weeks have been a battle unto themselves. I've grappled with cravings and situations that would have sent me running for a drink. I've mentioned I really want a beer. Just one. Bemoaned not having the ability to have a beer while mowing the lawn. But I haven't given in. I've literally taken life one day at a time, clawing out the wins. Fighting the demon.

But in the last four ish weeks, I've noticed little things changing. Full disclosure: I've doubled down on the caffeine a little. One step at time. Productivity has gone up a little. I've noticed changes to my mood being a little more even. Sleep has been up and down, but overall good. I can't sleep over 8 hours anyhow. Making and sticking to decisions has been easier. 

One fear of sobriety was who will I be on the other side? I mean, I felt like so many different people since drinking, I didn't always know who I was anyhow. Am I throwing the proverbial haymaker to have fun at the party? Or am I drowning in my own shit tonight? Truth be told, it's been slightly anticlimactic, which is okay. I'd rather take it slow.

I wish all of you the best.

Edit: guys it’s extremely important for me to explain my process better. My anxiety and depression got WAY worse after I quit and was very up and down for a while.. A long while. I knew something wasn’t right because it was comorbid with feeling quite sick sometimes. Waves of body aches and just no energy at all. I found pleasure in nothing. This took a long long time to resolve. Some days I genuinely thought I was insane. But with the addiction.. It went. All of it. I feel joy, compassion, healthy, I feel love, I sleep great, I feel smart again. The fact that I’m able to say this after experiencing - in varying degrees - just about every psycho-pathology there is, is nothing short of a miracle.

Longest I’ve ever truly been sober. I can’t believe it! 

I’ve never gotten sober on my own before. The first time it’s because probation forced me. But no one told me I had to do it this time. And for once I’m proud of myself and am starting to see that I’m not that shitty of a person after all. Not half bad. ❤️

My boyfriend lives in another state and I’m going to visit tomorrow. He’s taking me to the zoo because I’m silly and enjoy stuff like that, it’s going to be our first real date together in 6 months. And for both of us, our first SOBER date! We are BOTH SOBER NOW! Drugs and alcohol made things so difficult for us. Getting sober has been so painful and so many tears have been shed. 

I’m happy and I get to experience what happy actually feels like. I get to spend time with people that remind me life is worth living. sobriety has given me this and so much more. I almost gave up so many times but I didn’t for another day today. Thanks for reading and sharing this moment with me yall ❤️",209,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9146578}"

Then it became wine AND champagne.  Then it slowly became wine and champagne and me secretly adding an EXTRA bottle of wine just for me - to keep a nice “buzz” going.  And slowly but oh so surely, over the years, alcohol stole the night away.

Soon the party was secondary - foods often only halfway prepared or left thawing in a cold oven...  “party attire” that looked as though someone drunk had chosen our outfits... because someone drunk had... and me, usually so drunk or passed out on the couch, well, I wouldn’t remember most of the winners... or even most of the night.

Worst of all- Monday was spent feeling guilty and ashamed about what the night - and me - had turned into over the years.  I could google to get what happened on the show, but I’d never get back the time I wasted with a little sprite of a girl who thought a “party” with mommy was the coolest thing ever, magical like we’re PRINCESSES or FAIRIES, oh yeah ✨👑✨...

Last night, my now 12 year old daughter doesn’t think these party things (insert huge eye roll here 🙄) that mommy does are cool anymore.  But this year, I was there 100% every freaking second.  I could cry about all the time I missed (and I still do that plenty), but if I do too much of that, I miss the “now”.  And the “now” is still pretty darn sweet.

I've made this decision before a few times and I guess the only thing that's different now is that I've told it loud and clear to my fiancée (and you guys).

I'm a pretty normal guy. Got an office job, getting married later this year, early 30's. I started drinking when I was 18 at parties. Between 18 and about 25-26 the pattern was your usual party binge drinking. At 22 I first started drinking alone as well, got a bit heavy when my dad died but bounced back. Last few years I've basically stopped partying altogether and stopped drinking hard liquor. I didn't even drink ""real"" beer in my mind because I'd get 2,8 % or 3,5 % beers at the supermarket. 

At least once a week I'd drink 6-12 50cl (tall can) 3,5 % beers when playing video games and eating chips. Low alcohol percentage or not, it adds up.

So my reasons to quit are the following:

- Physical health. I want to reduce my risk of organ damage, heart disease and cancer. Turns out cancer risk for instance isn't just for hard drinkers, it comes at any level of drinking. I want to grow real old.

- Mental health. Working from home and generally having life put on hold by the pandemic has really made a dent in my mental health, and a couple of times now I've had bouts of intrusive thoughts with severe anxiety. I saw a therapist about it and learned some tools to make sure it doesn't get worse. I'm not sure alcohol caused this, but you don't have to be a genius to figure out it doesn't help.

- Relationships. I don't want to lie to my fiancée, or be indisposed when she needs me. My dad was quite a heavy weekend drinker and that made home feel unsafe for me, I never want to be like that.

- Money & time. Alcohol costs money, and so does the crappy food I stuff myself when binging. And the hangovers? So many wasted days. I want to be able to enjoy my whole weekends, not just those 30 minutes on Friday when drinking actually feels good, and I want to be able to perform at work (even if I don't choose to do so everyday).

- It's sinful. I'm Christian and I consider drunkenness to be sinful. Drinking might not be, but drunkenness is, and I don't drin - I get drunk. I'd lie if I said that this was my biggest motivation in my heart of hearts, but I just don't want to sin because it makes me feel bad.

My biggest issue is forgetting why I quit. Usually happens around the 30-day mark. I hope this place and my fiancée can keep me focused.

So there it is.

I’ve been trying to unpack why I miss drinking so much these days. 7 months sober. I posted here recently that I’m afraid I will relapse and have been trying to dismantle my thinking to understand why. 

I have been romanticizing booze a lot, feeling like I will never have fun or feel glamorous again and my brain is trying to argue myself Into having it. Concerned that as a woman, opting out of wine and champagne culture is going to make me a less desirable and less popular person. 

I have a few theories why I miss drinking so much. Maybe exploring these ideas will help me understand what I can do differently. 

A) I’m an alcoholic (or some version of whatever that is, I’m not a fan of the word) who reacts to booze with a magical euphoric feeling, more so than a non addict.... is this why I crave it? My Partner who doesn’t have an issue says he can’t relate to alcohol giving him that sense of magic... 

B) life in lockdown is perpetually boring and alcohol feels like it would bring a sense adventure im craving. 

C) because life really is a bit less fun without booze and I have to accept that a sober life will be more peaceful, but also less exciting. And I don’t want to accept a less fun existence. 

D) our society is still obsessed with alcohol, and while many people quietly struggle, the majority is still trapped in a cycle of drinking in order to bond. As a social creature it’s very isolating to be on the outside of the bonding and I desperately want to be part of the group. 

E) others don’t have an issue and I am jealous of them. And haven’t accepted myself yet. 

F) all of the above 


It’s F isn’t it... 

So the exercise tells me what I can do to feel better is make new friends who don’t drink so I don’t feel as isolated. And have some genuine fun and adventure. 

I think I understand why the lockdown makes staying sober a tough Endeavour. What I need to do to feel better and get stronger is hard to do in a closed society. 

For now I will not drink today. And try again tomorrow.

While I struggled with social occasions, they were few and far between in that time period due to COVID.  I still had some and implemented some tactics to handle them.  But as more is being planned in the coming months, I find myself thinking about them as things I don't look forward to and just have to get past.  For example, there is a wedding out of town on my wife's side of the family.  These are massive drinking events in her family.  I was wishing she would just go with her sisters, but it sounds like the other husbands are going.  I'm realizing I will need to go, and my head is focused on getting through that day / night, being the designated driver, wanting to leave while they will want to be the last ones on the dance floor, going somewhere late night, etc.  

I'm so focused on what it takes to attend something like this, not drink, and still be a good date to my wife.  I really want to get to a point where I could look forward to it.  There's a feeling of loneliness in approaching social occasions with a ""just get through this"" mindset.  I really need to work on it.  There is no part of me that thinks the answer is to drink and give up on my sobriety.

I had an interesting revelation last night. And that is that especially now that I'm not wasting all my time and money drinking, I am kind of free to do whatever I want within Covid reason. I don't really have any hobbies unless you count getting stupid wasted, which I don't any more. And I would like that to change. I spent the first month of sobriety mostly sitting on my ass watching TV shows and playing this stupid Bejeweled-esque game on my phone.

Props to anyone who knows which dumbass game I've been staring at for a month.)

I'm thinking about joining a choir. Here is the problem. Well, Covid, but I'm almost done with my vaccination, and numbers in my area are going way down... Whatever, post-Covid whenever if ever that is, I would like to join a choir. But I'm not at all religious and just can't see joining a church choir. I also don't really want to join a serious choir where you have to audition and whatnot. I have an okay voice, but I'm unlikely to blow anyone's wheels off, and I mostly really don't want to get that serious about it. I just like to sing and want to have a little fun singing with other people who like to sing. So I found a group that sounds perfect, post-Covid. Non-religious, no auditions, sings all sorts of music, just people who like to sing and want to sing in a choir for fun. Sounds great! Except their website says that they practice in local breweries and bars. Because this is for fun and that's where adults go to have fun, amiright?!? Ugh. I don't think bars in particular are a big trigger of mine per se, because I never went to bars. But people drinking ""for fun"" surely are. Bad idea? I'm picturing proudly telling these people that no I will not have a drink because I'm an alcoholic and I just want to sing, which is true, but also worried that the addict in my head would be a pesky bitch as per usual.

I just recently got done with the first season of Westworld and the concept of the maze I found has a lot of parallels with what I see as my journey to sobriety.  So in the show the maze was the proper construction of the path to consciousness, as opposed to the origin conception of the pyramid, where the pyramid was an upward path that inevitably ended at the goal.  The maze was different in that it was paths with many choices along the way, the choices could either bring you closer to the center of the maze representing consciousness, or move you away from it towards insanity.  Simply making choices that offset previous choices kept you in a cycle between the two that was unending.  

I find this very apropos for describing my journey with alcoholism that ended up in sobriety, where the center of the maze was sanity, sobriety, and serenity; and the outer part was alcoholism, destruction and insanity.  When I was drinking, the choices I made took me further away from the center and after I sobered up I did my best to fix the results of those choices to bring me back closer to the center.  When I was trying to get sober the choices I made either kept me in a cycle, brought me closer to the center, or brought me further outside.  I eventually made the choices that brought me to the center and I'm now sober and happy that I'm sober.  I'm not a dry drunk or anything like that, I'm in sobriety, the choices I make that keep me sober are my own and freely made, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Another part about the maze in Westworld that also applies is that having reached the center of the maze comes the realization that it was external things that were guiding you there, but once there you realize that the voice you hear is your own voice, the voice of consciousness.  It's the same with sobriety, when I was trying to get sober I was being told all the ways and reasons to be sober, how it would be better.  Now it's my voice saying all those things.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6304513}"

I can't overcome the fear of being jugded, missing out and admitting my lies. So I keep on accepting drinks at social occasions, often leading to relapse.

People close to me know I have a problem. I always drink more than others at social events, my family has a history of alcoholism and two people close to me have expressed their concern.

I feel like I am at a critical point in my life. I always drank more than others from the start, but had my first drink alone about five years ago to relieve anxiety. The die were cast, next came the increasing consumption, sneaking drinks, lying and hiding my consumption. 

Three years ago it became worse as I started drinking large amounts at night, missing obligations and being scared. Six months later I started therapy.

I became aware of my challenges and got better, made the decision to quit drinking and not go back. Months of not drinking felt great, but one day I was faced with the challenge which I have struggled with ever since.

During dinner with my family my sister asked when I decided to stop drinking. I had not told anyone, but being a heavy drinker for a long time and suddenly saying no to drinks at social events was a sign of course. As my mom asked whether in general I could not have a drink at social events. I was scared of being honest and said I was still able to drink.

Growing up in a family affected by alcoholism and the fact that people earlier had earlier expressed their concerns with my drinking made me scared. 

I lied about my problem and consumption.

Alcoholism was obvious in my family but never something we talked about. I suspect this reinforced my perception of the stigma, since it is so shameful that we can't talk about it.

Also all the damage and pain alcoholism caused is perhaps something I fear being associated with.

I am isolating myself, not attending social events because I am afraid. 

Looking for advice on how to overcome this.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80006045}"

Yet another reason to drink myself asleep every night. Sad part is that's 99% of the problem. That extra 1200 calories a day isn't helping.

Back on day 1. I've been on a really great stint--exercising every day, I recently got my PMP certification (project management), I have an interview lined up with a great company, and I already have a great job. I was sober from december through februry, nearly into march, and then I started 'casual drinking' again. 

I felt like I was doing everything right, and between all the monotony of just crushing my goals, I got bored along the way.

I moved across the country by myself in october, and I have my dog, but I don't really know anyone here other than coworkers, and I'm high up enough where I can't make relationships too personal, everything topical, weather, food, exercise, bullshit bullshit bullshit. Making friends is hard enough without covid, or a 'buddy to introduce you to people', so I think I was secretly getting depressed.

I passed my PMP certification last week on Friday, and the stars aligned for 'go time'. Got 2 packs of well, whatever, and just proceeeded to absolutely tank myself into oblivion. Utter disregard for the person I built myself into, the relationships I have with people in my building, messy texts, oversharing, the whole 9. I segued into Saturday, and because of my normal exercise habits I was up at 530AM, cracked whatever was left and off I went to the races for numero dos. Sunday was no better. I felt sick but I drank anyway, cuz thats what I do.

I do this every time. I am an unabashed alcoholic, there is no ""I'll have one"", no, its lets get ruined, 0 cares about consequences.

and I find all the behavior I avoid and all the things I try not to be just bubble over, because maybe that will find me companionship or some fucked up way of thinking.

I don't talk to my old friends from the other coast, when I was at my lowest, they all abandoned me. I don't blame them, but I don't forgive them either. 

I don't talk to my family for other reasons, and I feel really isolated and alone a lot. I know I need to build healthy habits back up, so today, I'm not drinking, and I'll look for other ways to get back into the world, because alcohol brings nothing good to my life.

Removing the alcohol has allowed me to focus on my anxiety issues rather than mask them. Unfortunately, the combination of my anxiety and alcohol actually worked for me for a long time. The anxiety would drive me to complete projects and the alcohol let me 'switch things off' when I got home. Then the drinking increased and the anxiety got to a point where I was shutting down. Without the drinking, I'm now trying to dial in my meds but I also have to find new approaches to work and find motivation other than fear to drive me. Overall, I'm a much happier person and much less irritable but for the time being my job is suffering.

I'm not sure whether to talk to my boss or not as I work through this because my performance is definitely slipping. I really feel that once I get my meds dialed in I'll be able to find that balance but for lack of a better phrase ""things are different"". I guess the point to my rambling is that my path is definitely going in the right direction, it's just that now I can see how long a path it really is.

I read and posted on here daily in my first few months, and this community helped me so much. So thank you. 

I’m coming here to share that I had such intense cravings last night, the worst I’ve had since my first month of sobriety. Yesterday my city held a massive anti-mask rally, which is just so disappointing. Our numbers are already going up, and I am so dismayed at the prospect of another lockdown. This whole situation feels endless.

Honestly, I just wanted to be self-destructive. I wanted to drink myself into oblivion so I didn’t feel this hopelessness anymore. I’ve learned so many different coping mechanisms in the past year, but in that moment I was ready to say “fuck it” and just drink. 

Fortunately, I didn’t. I ate a million calories instead (not ideal but better than the alternative). I’m still feeling pretty hopeless this morning, but I’m not hungover. I got to enjoy my coffee end eat my breakfast clear-headed, well-rested, with a settled stomach. I get to do whatever I want today, with no hangover or brain-fog to hold me back. Even if I decide to languish on the couch all day, it will be MY choice, not something dictated by a hangover. 

I guess I’m just trying to say, if you’re looking for a sign to NOT drink, this is it. I’m not here to tell you I am the happiest woman alive today, but I feel 1000% better than I did if I had drank yesterday. I felt the cravings but I didn’t have to give into them, and that feels good.

Drinking was such a huge part of my identity. At family functions, I was seen as the ""cocktail guy"". If you wanted a really good drink, I was your guy. It was even my responsibility to come up with fun drinks for each holiday, not to mention the annual summer vacation that revolves around drinking at the beach and poolside. 

I was really scared to give up alcohol. The thought of never drinking again would fill me with such dred. How would I explain this to my loved ones? What would people think of me? How would social functions be even remotely fun without drinking? But then I realized: If I'm this concerned with giving up alcohol, it truly has a much stronger grip on me than I realized. 

I later realized that these fears, although very real for me at the time, were ridiculous. My loved ones supported me, I don't owe explanations to anyone, and I managed to have fun hanging out with people for a very long time before I ever drank, and I realize now that I don't need, or even want alcohol to have a good time. 

I want to thank everyone here for being so supportive! You guys are truly amazing. Without this group, and the book This Naked Mind, and I don't know what I would have done.

Am I supposed to just go to any meeting, or is there a way to research what sort of meeting will be best/most comfortable for me?

Am I supposed to accept any sponsor, or again, is there a method for 'matching' people so the process is comfortable and effective/more likely to work? Or does it just work.

The longest I have been sober is about 4 days. This has been a cycle for approximately 5 years. I was a casual drinker in college, but I started self medicating with alcohol the last several years. Drinking alone, drinking before work meetings, drinking before dates, drinking before confronting my roommate about small things, drinking heavily before and after family gatherings and holidays. I drank anytime I felt even mildly uncomfortable because I couldn’t cope with my anxiety. I am still sorting out my relationship with guilt, shame, and alcohol. But what I’ve realized in the last 20 days, is that alcohol makes those problems much worse. 

Alcohol does not help anxiety, it exacerbates it.

My ""no"" got a bit stronger when refusing to drink, and for the first time ever I didn't feel tempted, when he was going on about how good the beer tastes. When I was walking home, I enjoyed the empty, quiet streets. No heavy feeling on my stomach, no stumbling over my own legs, no swaying left and right to keep balance, no depressing thoughts, no anger or aggression, no unbearable desire to smoke a cigarette. Instead, I felt quite calm and energetic. After coming back home, instead of just flopping on my bed and passing out, I did some creative work towards my passion, and the next day I woke up feeling alright. I consider that a major success. And in a few days, I'll beat my own record of a consecutive number of days without a single sip of alcohol.

I kept it sober and watched the immediate family keep having to make trips to ""check on the dog"" (AKA: refill the vodka drink or pour more wine in the Snapple bottle; they live next door). This kind of made me feel all sorts of things from mad to sad but in the end this is my journey and I need to remember not to deflect it on others. I hope someday my actions may help them make better decisions about theirs.

another off guard thing happened that night that may have actually helped me. while looking at an old picture from a family reunion I asked: ""hey isn't that cousin so and so? haven't seen them in decades (not that I had met them more then twice in my life), what are they up to?"" I was then informed they had recently passed... I knew they were young so I didn't ask, but must have gave the wondering look which was met with ""they were a heavy alcoholic"". I wasn't totally shocked but it was a stark reminder of how real this thing can get if left unchecked.

\#2) next day second family member travels 3 hours for a surprise visit and BBQ: this one was at the boozey family's house, DEFF a usual heavy drinking situation. packed up some NA drinks and hit it like a champ! had a few urges but was able to shoot them down quickly and move past. again got to watch them all get sloppy and was happy to have my clear head.

\#3) went out in the woods scouting for camping spots for upcoming holiday: ok, this one 100% with out any encouragement from others would have been my jam to grab some brews and ride around in the middle of no where. I packed up the grill and some dogs, some NA brew from athletic I just got, seltz water, and hit the trail. my SO drank a few which didn't bother me and we had a great day out in the fresh air and amazing nature.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

Trigger warning: Death and dying

Last week, an acquaintance's mother passed away from cancer rather suddenly. She had begun acting rather strangely and was taken to the hospital, where they discovered four massive, inoperable brain tumours. There was nothing they could do for her but keep her comfortable. However, due to COVID, the only person who could visit her in her final days was her husband. Her children were not allowed to see her until her very last moments to say their goodbyes.

As we reflected on the absolute tragedy and heartbreak of losing a parent and not being able to be with them, a friend told the story she heard of a nurse who had been taking the time to sit and sing to dying patients who were alone because their families weren’t allowed to come to the hospital. 

I thought that would be a beautiful story to share here so I tried to find it, but I couldn’t. Instead, I found dozens. Story after story of nurses who are setting aside their stethoscopes to spend time with people who are dying so they aren’t alone.

I was incredibly moved. Thank you to all the nurses out there who are stepping in to bring comfort to people who are caring for people who are fighting their final battle by just holding their hand or listening to their stories of life and love. Bringing comfort during the scariest and loneliest moments of life. You’re doing amazing work. Thank you.

I went to detox about eight months ago and have drank sporadically since then, but my recent drink was about two months ago. But it's the PAWS that gets me– or at least that's what I think it is.

It feels like mini withdrawals. Heart racing / pounding, heightened stress and anxiety, out-of-body type sensations. Those are probably the ""clearest"" symptoms, but the main one that's actually causing consistent trouble in my relationships is sudden irrational frustration. It actually feels like my real self recedes into my mind, and I see this spiteful monster come out and say things I can't control. Like, I'm watching myself act like a dick, wishing I wouldn't, but feeling like I can't stop. My friend actually told me today that it seems like I don't have a baseline personality. That my mood and demeanor changes so dramatically that it's like I'm different people.

I write this post to see if anyone else has felt this or dealt with it successfully. I am very proud of the sobriety I've achieved, and I'm proud of you all as well. I just don't see this subject spoken about often and I'm at a loss. I wish I could've just quit drinking and been better. But from what I read online it can last years, and that's enough to drive someone to say screw it, I'll just drink then. It's hell if you do, hell if you don't.

My in-laws visit every few weeks so we have a stash of wine to break out when they stay with us. Until the start of the year I'd gladly join them in a glass or 7, but recently it's been just for them.

Since I gave up drinking on NYD I've discovered the joy of cooking and have been using my evenings to cook healthy and nutritious meals instead. A recipe I came across calls for 1 cup of red wine, which I've always skipped until now – I was never brave enough to crack open a bottle just to put a small amount into the meal, and know the rest was just sitting there.

On their last visit, my in-laws left half a bottle of red here, so instead of throwing it out, I decided to keep it for later to use in this recipe.

So far, so good. But now as it simmers for the next 60mins, the kitchen is flooded with the smell of red wine and I'm starting to regret my decision. I'm not having cravings or anything, but the smell is just so foreign to me now.

Second of all, what is sleep? I feel like I woke up every hour, after spending 3 hours trying to fall asleep. But I woke up sober, semi refreshed and on time to my alarm! Praying that a long day at work means sleep will come easier tonight.

Then there’s the sober spins. Like wtaf, I thought I was dying there for a while yesterday. Dizzy but not actually dizzy? Hoping that was just my body telling me to laze around because THAT wasn’t fun. Neither was the constant feeling that my stomach was a water balloon. Food seemed to help.

Now it’s Monday and I can’t feel sorry for myself because the show must go on. I made tea this morning instead of trying to find the remaining drop in the bottom of a bottle to steady my nerves.

I then put dinner in the oven and slept way past the alarm I had set to take it back out again. Thankfully, I didn't burn my house down, or, you know, kill someone out on the road. 

I then continued to drink every day. I passed out drunk every night. Drank in the mornings...even had a 3-4 hour anxiety attack at work the one day. Which was fun. I blew a ton of money. I stayed up all night taking shot after shot of whiskey and every ""morning"" I would wake up feeling like I might have another anxiety attack.

Then why, oh why, knowing a this does that little voice come out and start filling me with nonsense?  Insanity!  I didn't drink.  That's all that matters.

Okay, rant over.

2021-04-26 00:45:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mypt3u/what_a_journey/,What a journey!," This is my first post here. I have made it to 15 days! I had been drinking every day since I was 17. I could not be more proud of myself. I have been lurking since last November but never really thought that I would give up alcohol. I had tried a few times but never made it past 4 days. I had 2 really big wake-up calls that made me stop. 

The first wake-up call was when I had just gotten off work and chose to have a ""couple"" beers; ended up being four times that. I made the wise decision that I would make the 10-minute journey home with no problem. My inner voice telling me "" you've done it before, no problem, you got this"". I was texting my SO who was asking me when would I come home. I pull over to reply to her. As I text back I see red and blues pull up in front of where I had pulled off. He says I'm slurring my words and proceeds to ask have I been drinking. I tell him I've had a couple. Then he asks me to step out, I start freaking out. My mother taught me to be respectful to all officers and do as they ask. I step out. My heart is racing. The officer asks me to stand feet together and trail the end of a pen. This was the scariest moment of my adult life. He says I'm good to go and to get home safe... I thank him by name and thank him for his service to our community. I get home, walk in the door and proceed to bawl my eyes out. I was so close. This was my first wake-up call.

The second was a few days later, not following the sign that the universe just gave me, I go out again to do ""errands"" around 8 pm. My SO asked me when would I be home again. I proceed to let time fly by. My SO text ""so no movie night I guess"" at 12:30 am and goes to bed. The next thing I know it is 2:30 am bar is kicking everyone out. The next morning there is a letter waiting for me, the gist is *you can't drink anymore if we are going to stay together*. I relisted I was pushing her away, and this was her last straw. She gave me one more opportunity I took it seriously, and here I am now a half month. 

I want to thank this sub for helping me take a long look at myself. Everyone here is super inspiring and super supportive. 

I'm glad I made the change and everything I have read here is true. I have more time, my days are longer, I'm much happier. Even in these 15 days, I have seen a change in my finances.

If you made it this far, thank you!

One day at a time.

So no one has to go back and read it I was talking about how I wanted to buy new shoes that were expensive, but even though they were less expensive than my old liquor budget I felt guilty. 

Well, sometimes luck happens. Some of you might not see this as lucky at all but I’ll take it. So I went and bought the shoes, but to my dismay the leather was dented. It wasn’t too bad but if I’m paying that much this shit better be perfect. I felt like drinking, I had that feeling that the world is against me and everything that could go wrong will, but I felt I should email the company pictures and see if I could get an exchange first. Their policy said they didn’t do full exchanges internationally, but isn’t the customer always right?

They didn’t answer my email, send me any return labels, but all the sudden my bank notified me of a full refund. Even the international shipping. This was over a week ago so if it was a mistake, and no ones notifying me, well too late.

Sometimes taking that dive is worth it. Now I have free, slightly dented boots. I still have more money saved than I’d ever have had by this time last year. And I’m still sober because I decided to be a Karen for a minute and kick my social anxiety in the ass (I was respectful lol). 

I’ve also been able to reflect after that even if it did go wrong, I’m still ahead of my drunken self.

She's a big drinker, and I was feeling left out watching her drink beers with lunch and cocktails in the sand. I chugged my club soda and powered through. 

Then came the switch! I watched it clear as day.  The first drink or two feels like a treat, but once you get buzzed the drinking is robotic. You don't enjoy it because you don't even notice it. I've experienced this from the inside, but it's interesting to watch it happen to another person from a sober vantage point. I didn't realize how fast it happens, just a couple drinks really. Suddenly I felt glad for my sobriety, and for once it was not just the big picture things. I actually felt glad for the sensation of sobriety while people around me were drinking. 

I watched my sister's energy plummet, and she sat in the sand with glazed eyes and a cocktail. 
I dove in the ocean and let the waves pull my limbs in all directions, shaking the tension out of my hands, my shoulders, my toes. Tiny cold currents swirled up from below, mingling with the sun-baked surface and sending ribbons of goosebumps that melted and rose and melted again. I shook and danced and laughed at myself, acting like a kid in the privacy of the ocean's vastness. The exercise made me feel graceful and virile; my muscles seemed to celebrate their own exertion, until finally I rolled on my back and relaxed completely into the bouyant salinity. Listening underwater was somehow loud and quiet, tiny bubbles and near-silent roars which hinted at the sea's unfathomable hugeness.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** 

Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

DETACH- Don’t Even Think About Changing Him/Her

“Honey, you just have to be like a turtle and let it roll off your shell!” My boss used to tell me this and I despised it. I would get so wound up over every little thing. I was stuck in quicksand, in a bottomless pit of hate and anger. It was hell on earth trying to control everything. Especially my drinking, wowza, that was rough.

When I quit drinking I had to learn to ‘detach’ with love. I had to stop trying to control everything. I had to ‘let it go’ so I could be free. It is so much easier knowing that the only thing I’m in control of today is myself. With polite and loving detachment of other’s thoughts and concerns I was gifting myself the greatest gift. The gift of letting go which allows me to begin to take care of myself. If only I had known this throughout my 20’s! 

A few things I can’t control.....well....almost everything. I can’t control the weather, world events, other people’s opinions, other people’s actions, other people’s words, my dogs poor behavior, gossip, my addiction to alcohol, my family who mostly all drink, my friends who drink and pretty much everything. In fact, the only thing I can control are my actions and reactions today because I can make the choice not to drink. Just for today (JFT!) 

Letting go is a daily practice. I still have to remind myself regularly. I frequently have to express myself to others in recovery. A tool, there’s a phenomenal book called The Language of Letting by Melody Beattie. I keep a minimum of five copies around and gladly give it to anyone who will take it, recovering or not. As you can tell by now I love daily readings.

*Be like a turtle and let it roll off your shell.* Let it go! Because if you’re here you are kicking ass and should be super proud of yourself. You deserve a hug and a pat on the back. I hope you all have a fantastic week! 

Is there something, just for today, you can let go of? A worry or concern? Something you can say this about, ‘You know what, I’m doing totally awesome and that’s not my problem!’ *Load lifted off shoulders.* 

P.S.- Just a little shout out to all the Day 1’s today and those who are now on Day 2 with us today! 

Some quotes...

“Detachment does not mean non-involvement. You can be deeply involved but not entangled.”- Jaggi Vasudev

“If we try too hard to force others to live in our world, because we think it is the real world, we are doomed to disappointment.”- William Glasser, MD

“I will detach myself from conflicts with others if they arise today. I am not going to fight anything or anybody, and I know this will bring me closer to the ideal of living at peace with everybody.” -Walk In Dry Places (Hazelden)

I recently went into a liquor store to get a couple bangs, no issues browsing or urges to buy, but its just easier to get them from a liquor store than a busy gas station or grocery store, ect.

I've also been seeing this woman. The first woman I've seen on a regular basis since before my sobriety. I was straight up with her about my alcoholism.

She asks if it would be OK to have a glass or two of wine and I'm honest and tell her I don't know but we can see how it makes me feel. It caused me a lot of anxiety simply for the fact of being around open alcohol. I don't have any urges to drink and the scent doesn't evoke any odd feelings besides disgust.

I even cook her dinner one night and buy her some of her favorite wine. It was such a weird feeling being in the alcohol aisle for anything besides myself looking for the highest % alcohol.

The thought of ""just one wouldn't hurt"" crossed my mind and quickly squashed that with a ""yeah it would."" It would unravel everything I've accomplished. It only lasted a splint second but it's still there lingering in the back of my mind.

I figured I would come here to hold myself accountable and continue the progress.

When it was bad on numerous occasions, the alcohol told me that I had a rough streak and that I could try to moderate again.  I was convinced that this was true.  Unfortunately, I’ve poisoned the people around me with my actions (career, family, and personal relationships - plural)

I had been tapering since Friday while browsing this sub and seeing so many stories I could identify with - and learned to be concerned about my health.  For the last couple of days I’ve been sweating and anxiously shaking my foot while waking up in bed every 1 hour almost on the dot.  Barely keeping a sip of water down.

Today I cleaned the messes I made with vomiting and poured out every last drop I had, taking the bottles out of my sight.

Based off of what I have read, I can stay positive and look forward to

-	no hangovers
-	competent thinking
-	motivation that doesn’t come from booze
-	brushing my teeth without gagging
-	sleeping soundly without sweating
-	most importantly: less alcohol induced anxiety
-	honorable mention to the post that details bathroom use

I am looking forward to making amends with people who have lost trust in me by showing some proof.  Today, I am making this decision for me.  Bought some Ben and Jerry’s to treat myself.

I am only 22 years old and alcohol has already created so many problems for me. Countless nights that I can't remember. I've completely ruined my self esteem from all of the embarrassment and shame I carry from my drunk actions. I have never been able to just have a couple drinks. If I have even one, it's going to turn into at least 6 (if I'm lucky). I grew up with money, so buying another round, and another, and another, has never been a problem for me financially. My parents both drink way more than I do, so I have never had any pressure from them to stop. When I drink with them, we are all drunk and so no one notices or cares that I have drank two bottles of wine by the end of dinner since they're doing the same thing too. Alcohol is a huge part of their life and they are European so it is also a cultural thing, but it has ruined my life and I am ready to quit for good. I have told them for years that I want to stop but they can't understand why I want to, and they always encourage me to drink when I am home. Luckily I don't live with them right now, which should make it easier to quit once I remove all the alcohol from my home.

1–alcohol tastes awful. The great wine I once like tastes god awful 
2-I was completely okay with AF wine as a toast. 
3-alcohol helps numb and escape. (This is why I came back)

I realize I’ve used alcohol as a crutch to escape, unwind, relax. It does the complete opposite. It traps, binds, an. Causes massive anxiety and shame. 

Yet here am believing it helps escape foe a few minutes, tops. 

I realize I need to work on connecting in my marriage and finding time away from my kids for myself. But using a toxin to escape for 20 minutes only to come back with more shame and anxiety is plain senseless.

Such an incredible feeling and although I don't think it every day anymore, it is still so important to me to be grateful for that decision I made 5 years ago and the support and love of this amazing community. Today travel is a little less possible :p but I got myself some fancy steaks at the farmers market (straight from the farmer) on the weekend, and I'm sipping a beautiful coffee and spent the morning chatting with my daughter and relaxing a little more than usual.

My best friend died of cancer a few months ago. We met in college and became instantly inseparable. He was my “person.” He suffered so pointlessly and needlessly for so long but he was still stronger and more positive than me, and I feel horribly alone in the world now despite having some other great friends who are doing their best to give me support. 

We’re both disabled and from strict/dysfunctional families and had been planning to live together (probably long term/permanently, but as a fully platonic thing) and support each other after he was better and out of the hospital. He was more physically disabled than me, and I was fully prepared to live as a caregiver for him long term if necessary. 

I’ve been living with my parents since college and therefore haven’t been able to drink much (except in the middle of the night in random parks and stuff, but that was dangerous enough as a female and hard enough to keep secret that I didn’t do it thaaaat often), but I recently moved away to my own place and now that I’m alone all day I kind of want to give up fully on life.
 
It’s really hard not to give in and drink a lot every night when, partly due to what happened to my best friend, I don’t see what the point of struggling and striving for things is in the first place. I mean, I do have several goals and dreams, but I feel that realistically speaking (aka factoring in money etc) and with my unreliable track record they’re unlikely to amount to anything anyway. I’m 25, and I feel old already - like I’ve run out of time and chances and energy to try anymore. 

I’ve had semi-serious problems with attempting to self-medicate trauma, religious rejection from family and likely autism and/or severe adhd using substances, including alcohol, since college, but I’ve been repeatedly trying to get clean and sober and relapsing throughout this entire year - I had a near-death experience due to an overdose(?) of one of the other substances in July, and my family never knew - I drove myself to the hospital. My best friend that died was one of the only reasons I got through that, and I don’t know how to deal with him being permanently gone without using anything.

I’ve been extremely motivated about trying to get sober at times,  but I have a hard time with consistency and I think the lack of in-person AA or NA meetings has made it quite difficult (I only started considering going to meetings after the lockdowns started so I haven’t been able to ever go) because I have a hard time processing things/connecting socially through screens (and in person, but with screens it’s even worse). 

I’ve told my remaining friends about my goal to get sober and about how difficult things have been, but none of them can relate to it and they all still have “their people” so I feel like an extraneous burden on them. 

I’ve always had problems understanding people and connecting to them, and I feel like I’m constantly desperately seeking human connection and understanding but finding only temporary fixes or emptiness. I think what I really want is a community, or a found family of sorts - I know there are many types of those and options out there, but I have so much trouble feeling like a true part of anything. I think the hardest/worst part is that I DID somehow manage to find a version of that - and now it’s gone, irrevocably. 

Anyway, this is getting super long so I’ll end it here. I just found this sub today and I was pretty astonished at how engaged and kind people seem to be here, so I figured I would try to reach out because unlike drinking, which is what I really want to do to, it couldn’t hurt.",40,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6906229}"

I was living in NYC at the time and justified it that I was just keeping up with a fast moving city and everyone else was doing it as well. Watching shows like Madmen that glamorized that lifestyle in NYC probably didn't help. When I met my lovely wife, I knew things needed to change and went over seven years without a drink. I also quit smoking at that time as well.

We've gone through a lot in the pandemic including a couple job changes and moving twice as well that ramped up stress. I decided one night, for God knows what reason, to order a beer. It wasn't really a conscious thing I had been thinking about up to that point. It just kind of happened...I think because I wasn't really taking care of myself the way that I should.

Most of you probably know what direction all this leads to. It is amazing that four months later my drinking habits look EXACTLY the same that they did 8 years ago. Like I picked up right where I left off. Drinking a big beer or two on the way home and then continuing on from there. Needless to say my body wasn't really handling it that well eight years ago but definitely not now. 

I've been making excuses that I know I need to quit and will when the time is right. That is all bullsh\*\*. I know what I need to do and I need to stop making excuses and start making decisions that I know I need to. Not next week, not the week after but now. There is no reason for me to beat myself up over what happened as I can't change any of it other then my actions going forward.

I am excited for the future. I know I will face challenges but I know I have made this change happen at one time in my life when I was much less emotionally mature and it is something I can make happen. I just happen to be 'blessed' with that 'alcoholic brain' that doesn't seem to think very well around alcohol.

Over the past 2 months I've managed to do a few 10 day stretches with no alcohol. Not with the plan to quit forever (yet), because that seems like too huge a commitment. Currently on day 8. I find it easier to contemplate if I tell myself ""I don't need to drink tonight. Maybe tomorrow"".

I agree with the general point of view here that becoming a moderate drinker after having struggled with dependence is very difficult, maybe impossible. But right now telling myself ""maybe tomorrow"" is making it easier (plus reading this subreddit has been very inspiring).

If I make it through today I will be one week sober. I've been drinking heavily, daily, for over a decade. On a good day I'll drink a six pack and go to bed annoyed that I have to consciously go to sleep. On a bad day I'd drink a fifth or more of whiskey in a couple hours or less and pass out. The bad days are becoming more frequent.  I'm tired. I'm tired of being tired all the time. I'm tired of being 29 and feeling like I'm 65. Im tired of being the drunkest guy i know. At this point all my ""normal"" friends just pity me, I can see it in their eyes when they talk to me. And on the other hand my drinking buddies and i just fuel each others problems.. Writing this is me stalling from going to the liquor store. Also the recurring thought of how tough this week has been and that it will be so much effort to get back to even just one week if I cave tonight. I made it through a Friday and Saturday which is good. I've been trying to take a break from alcohol for at least a year now but the weekends always get me. In my drinking history I've woken up in the hospital with a shattered ankle and no memory of how it happened (I blew a .36 at the hospital that night), crashed a car into a tree and wound up with a dui (blew a .18 that night, it was only sheer luck that nobody was hurt or killed), been to the emergency room for what I thought was a heart attack (it was a withdrawal induced anxiety attack) and yet after each of these instances I was drinking again within days. The only thing the dui taught me was to drink at home in isolation.  So then once covid hit I knew exactly what to do. For the majority of covid lock down I was downing a handle of wild turkey 101 and 90-120 beers a week, every week. Covid also allowed me to work from home so I didn't have to appear halfway presentable every morning.  I am grateful to have a good job that I have somehow been able to excel at even while being constantly hungover. I guess that's why they call it ""high functioning alcoholic"".  Since January 2021, I've been consciously cutting back. But when you're cutting back from 25+ drinks a day it takes a while to get down to levels below ""homeless frat boy"" status. My last drinks were 5 light beers on April 18th. I dont think I've had a full night of sleep since. But I know that takes time. I've lurked this sub for probably about a year and done several of the things I've seen recommended here, such as reading this naked mind and drinking la Croix. LA Croix has been a life saver I guess because its carbonated so it satisfies my ""need to have a drink in my hand"" fixation. I've basically been drinking a 12 pack of la Croix a day this week. You all are awesome and if you've made it this far thank you for reading my ramblings.

I noticed the manager/cashier's hands were shaking super badly while looking for the tag and handling the items. I didn't say anything but I think he felt self conscious and he told me ""Gosh, it's hard to work with a hangover! It was my friend's 50th last night and wow, we overdid it."" 

I laughed and said ""Oh, we've all been there. I get it.""

I was caught a bit off guard and I just said ""Yeah, sometimes we get to that place and that's okay.""

2021-04-25 18:09:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/myix39/i_can_remember_my_trip/,I can remember my trip!,"TLDR: instead of staying home feeling sorry for myself I took a cheap car camping trip into the mountains and it changed my perspective on life. Getting lost has a new meaning for me now. ——

My trip: 
I realize how dumb that title sounds. But I struggle to remember details any trip in the last 4-5 years. *Just living in the fog.* I’d waste my amazing trips and celebrations because I would ALWAYS overindulge in the local wine and craft beers. Wherever I went. Always. 

This time was different. 

A few days ago I was struggling with boredom at home. I was tempted and cranky. So I decided to jump in my car and head to the mountains like John fucken Muir. 

*(Quick note here: If I were drinking THERE IS NO WAY I would be brave enough to drive six hours into the mountains for the night with no plans. But my thinking is SO CLEAR NOW and I knew it would work out.)*

I didn’t have any fun money at the moment so I settled for car camping over a hotel. Knowing I could afford a motel if I absolutely needed to. I packed my hatchback car with lots of blankets, water, and a camera. 

I picked Mammoth Mountain California only because it was far, beautiful, and high away from my problems. Upon getting to Mammoth lakes it was 11pm and dark. **I didn’t realize it at the time but for the first time in a LONG TIME “where my next drink was” was not on my mind.**

Instead I was looking for a safe spot to park my car for the night.

 My girlfriend knows of my struggles and didn’t think twice of my spontaneity. In fact :) she packed me a *yeti thermos full of homemade French onion soup.* Therefore no matter where I parked I had food and water and was going to be fine. (She also snuck an extra blanket in the car)

Finally, on a forested mountain road near a ski resort I saw, as I would describe as #vanlife type vehicles were spread out along the road. So I assumed it was safe to park for the night. 
I learned later that this road was BLM (bureau of land management) owned road. Meaning you can car/RV camp simply by pulling off the road and parking. 

I parked, got out the car. And I realized I was completely by myself in the woods on a fucken mountain. In the moonlight I took a deep breath of the mountain air. Cold, crisp, and clean. My senses were on high alert as I was very new to this. The smell of fresh  sage was strong and I realized I was surrounded by wild sage bushes. It smelled like I was living inside highend candle. 

I peed in the bushes away from my car lol, I stretched out, then laid down in the back of my car. I feel asleep looking out my window at the stars through giant trees. Waking up that morning I was cozy in my makeshift bed. It was cold out but it was refreshing as hell.

 I experienced a sunrise I would actually remember. That morning I wasn’t thinking of sickness in my stomach or regrets of last night. Rather, I was wondering where I could get a good cup of coffee :) 

I found a great one in the village near by. Also I bought a well deserved breakfast sandwich there too. 

I called my girlfriend and told her I was staying an extra day! I rented skis for 30 bucks and skied Mammoth mountain! 

That night I found an even better spot with cell reception, I drank my near-beer, and watched a movie on my phone. It was called “Wild” a true story about 22yr old girl. An addict. Who spontaneously hikes the Pacific Coast Trail to get away from her problems. A very fucken fitting movie for me. (I honestly picked it because it was about the mountains and had a pretty girl on the cover)

All that came together beautifully for me. It wasn’t luck. It was because I can think clearly now. I can make decisions and plan without forgetting. 

I have goals finally. In between those goals getting lost is now a priority of mine. But for the first time in a long time my life isn’t controlled by a drunk foggy brain. No, it’s clear. Clear as that mountain air I breathed, looking up at the stars as I was peeing in a sage bush... 

I feel like I just stepped out of the fog my friends. Go get lost somewhere.

I want to be better,"Hello, I am new here and using my first post on this reddit account to try to address my problem with alcohol and hopefully get some things off my chest and sorted in my head. I know there are probably a lot of posts like this around here and I am new (have only lurked before) so I thank anyone who takes the time to read this. 
Some things about me are that I’m 24, queer, autistic, and I have a problematic relationship to substances/escapes, specifically alcohol. 

So, this morning I admitted to my partner that I have a problem with drinking. I might go so far as to say that I’m an alcoholic, and that’s probably true, but the words don’t feel right in my mouth and I can’t quite feel comfortable saying it yet. In the past, I’ve written off my dependence on alcohol because I don’t drink all that much (as in, not every day and it doesn’t take much alcohol to affect me) in comparison to other people struggling with alcoholism that I knew.

I started drinking in college, pretty much as soon as alcohol was made available to me. I have always felt very “other” in social settings, never comfortable and always hyper-vigilant of potential social missteps. I’ve learned as an autistic person to “mask” socially, to take on certain tones of voice and to mimic behaviors in others that don’t come naturally to me. I often feel that I have had to closely study other people to understand their mannerisms and what makes them comfortable around someone, to know when it is and isn’t my turn to speak, to understand what different reactions mean (especially when there are hidden meanings veiled in social niceties, that are obvious to others but that I have to work hard to understand).

As a part of this hyper-vigilance that I feel, I am pretty much always incredibly anxious. I have a constant stream of self-critical thoughts flowing through my brain and it’s so difficult to ignore. I am always putting in a great amount of effort to not come off as “weird” to others, and as I have reached adulthood, the weight of this endeavor has left me desperate to escape this state of mind. 

So with that, when I reached college and drinking culture was the norm around me, I participated readily. What I found was that I felt so much more socially at ease while drinking and around others who were drinking. Intoxicated people are much more forgiving when it comes to weirdness, and I was able to let my guard down for the first time and really connect with people. When I drank, I felt all of these blocks and filters in my mind lifted. Socializing didn’t feel like so much of a grind anymore. I was able to be intimate with others (which I could never let my guard down enough to do before). Going out and participating in drinking culture made me feel normal, accepted, and “correct” as a woman. 

It wasn’t long before I started having a bit too much, a bit too much of the time. I would end up overindulging a lot. I told myself it was because I was still getting used to drinking. Fast forward to today, and the urge to drink for ease, or distraction, or escape is littered throughout my mind. 

I feel so much shame, and so much sadness, that I have come to the place where I am with drinking. About two weeks ago, I was sick in bed and unable to sleep. I had had part of a glass of wine, knowing I wasn’t feeling well and it would make things worse. I couldn’t sleep a wink, with the headache and discomfort. I’ve been avoiding the deep knowledge within myself that I am dependent on alcohol and I am robbing myself of the opportunity for growth and healthy coping mechanisms, but it hit me that night like a ton of bricks. With my body immobilized, but my brain very much awake, I saw my dependence on substance for what it is - distraction from my self, a replacement for self-regulation, and something that steals my higher self away from my loved ones who need me. Even though I felt more grounded the next day and chalked this revelation up to fever-fueled catastrophic thoughts, I haven’t been able to shake the feeling that I have to change, that I know better.

Last night, I got drunk and overwhelmed and had a meltdown. I saw the unsettled look on my partner’s face as I stumbled through the house chaotically. Later that night, they dumped all the alcohol (that they bought) down the drain.

I’ve been hurting myself, and I’ve been hurting my loved ones by not showing up emotionally and allowing myself to become frequently intoxicated to the point that I’m not there any more to take responsibility for myself. 

So this morning I dumped the rest of the hard alcohol down the drain and I have been quietly trying to collect myself. I told my partner that I know I have a problem, but I know I have more work to do here and I hurt them with my actions so we aren’t really talking right now (I don’t blame them, it was a rough night). So my question for all of you who have walked this path or something similar is, where do I go from here? How do I ask for help, and who do I ask for help from? What were your next steps, and do you have any advice for me?

TL;DR - I have a problem with alcohol, and I am just beginning to admit this to myself and really process how I ended up here. I would really appreciate any advice on what to do next or tips for addressing my substance dependence.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.567239}"

I stopped literally because if this sub. I saw my counter that I started over 800 days ago and I was appalled at myself. I was still doing the exact same shit 800 days later.

We've been together almost 9 years and she's been with my through a really tough last year dealing with stopping drinking and dealing with bipolar stuff. 

We both said some stuff we shouldn't have and I let it take my emotions way way way out of control, she went off to be with friends and I stayed in bed under the covers pretty much the whole day. By the end of the night I had a bottle of vodka out considering taking a drink. 

Ultimately, I decided not to, that as desperately as I did not want to exist in that moment, I knew I was smarter than that bullshit and it would not help anything and just make me feel like shit tomorrow and lose this awesome streak. 

We talked it out this morning. We love each other very much. Have some stuff to work on together to help continue making each other happy, but overall was nothing worth getting as bent out of shape as I was. 

I still have to continue learning to deal with my bipolar and mental health to not react like that and not lose the whole day having a little mini breakdown over things, and that is ok, I am in therapy and continuing to work on that stuff. 

But by not drinking, I allowed it to be talked out in the morning, and now we can try to move forward and improve. Drinking would have made everything so much worse. Our morning conversation would have been completely different. I am just so thankful and also feeling proud of myself. 

Even the best relationships are going to have their bumps and I am happy to be sober and present to handle mine like an adult.

This is long and probably boring to be honest. But I want to type it out. So... I guess read it if you're bored!

I was 9 months sober when the pandemic hit. That was the longest I'd ever gone without a drink since I started drinking at 21 years old. Longest by far. My ""record"" before that was probably a hot 30 days. I wasn't drinking heavily back then, not at the start. In fact, I remember getting high with some of my friends one night in my early 20's. We had that old volcano vape thing. Remember that? That was a big deal when it first came out. We had to all go in on the cost. So we were smoking and drinking Southern Comfort. The weed made a lot more sense to me at the time. It felt good, it was smooth and inviting. The alcohol, on the other hand, was harsh and sickly (anyone who has had SoCo knows that...). I told the boys ""this is poison!"" Referring to the alcohol. 

But, the laws being the laws, I drifted away from weed because it was harder to get, more expensive, and harder to hide from my parents. The smell and all that. I drifted towards alcohol because it was available everywhere, cheap, and easier to hide. I also liked how it helped ""turn off"" my overactive brain. And that was the start of it all, really. I wanted to desperately to be able to numb myself. 

I didn't have a hard life. I had a pretty easy one, really. But my anxiety was unbearable. And I didn't get any help from my parents on that. So I self-medicated. It let me talk more freely with my friends and with strangers. It got my out of my shell. It gave me (perhaps false) confidence. 

Eventually I was drinking every day. Earlier and earlier. I was drunk while doing college homework, while taking online exams. I was drinking and depressed and I couldn't bear the thought of getting a ""real"" job so I just stayed at home. Unemployed, a burned to my parents, spending all my time drinking and farting around on the Internet. Accomplishing nothing. Not growing in any way. For 13 years I sat and I drank and I was depressed. I had a few good friends, and I interacted fine with (other drunk) strangers, but I was scared of anything real. So I hid away, never even trying to get in a real relationship, hell... even rejecting the few poor girls who tried to get to know me. 

I eventually got a job, moved out, but kept drinking. I was hungover at work, belligerent to coworkers. I didn't care. The depression was getting worse. Then, one day, an angel appeared. A new girl at work. Long story short, we dated for a short time, I was happy for the first time in my adult life, she broke it off (very reasonably and maturely on her part), and I spiraled down down down. After way too long, I had a ""rock bottom"" moment one night and resolved to quit. And I did. I succeeded where I had previously failed so many times. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months. Then, the pandemic hit and in a fully premeditated decision I set out to drown myself in liquor. That lasted about a month until, after drinking through the night until about 10 AM, passing out, waking up at 6 PM, and retching so violently that I tore something in my throat... I resolved to quit again. That was April 25th 2020. 

Now, here I am after a year. A year of working from home, of staying reclusive, of failing to devote time to the things I'd hoped to, failing to start dating again, failing to do basically anything at all I set out to do... except not drinking. And I feel so very proud of myself. I didn't drink. So if nothing else, I accomplished that. My head has never been more clear. I finally have an idea of what I want out of life. I am in a position to actually go after what I want. There's still so much work I have to do on myself, but I'm sober and that's my foundation. 

When I was drinking heavily, I literally could not picture a life without alcohol. I thought I'd never be able to quit. I accepted my ""lot"" in life as a drunk. Now, on the other side of the bottle, after a year of sobriety, I find it difficult to put myself back in the old life in my mind. It's hard to imagine all those blurry nights and hungover mornings. I think the human spirit is truly amazing. So adaptable (for better and for worse) that we can get used to just about anything. 

I know now that I am an alcoholic and I always will be an alcoholic. This battle for me will never be ""over."" I have to stay vigilant. I also know that, no matter how tempted I ever get to start drinking again, it will only hold me back from getting the things I want. And that has kept me going. In the darkest moments when I'm most tempted, I remind myself of that. 

I want to thank my friends, this community, and stoicism for keeping me alive and sober for the past 12 months. I am unbelievably lucky, luckier than I often realize, to be in such a place of relative security when so many people out there are really struggling with the harsh realities of this pandemic.

It honestly feels like I’m at another rock bottom. Realistically speaking then there’s only one way to go forward from here. 

I’m sitting in my bed full of anxiety, trembling, sweating and struggling to focus on anything else but how I completely shit the bed with a new person I was talking to by being drunk for multiple conversations. Whether I like it or not I’m checking my phone almost every half hour for some kind of notification but...after that last phone call. I think that was it for him. I found myself embarrassing and stumbling through thoughts simultaneously apologizing and giving off the general vibe I needed validation. I’ve allowed alcohol to give me very transparent false confidence day after day, night after night and isolated myself to the point nobody could say anything about it. I haven’t worked in a year and I’m terrified to. Drinking on a liter of vodka throughout a five day period from morning to passing out. The person I’ve become is someone who subconsciously gave up. 

And the worst part about it is...I liked him a lot. I could tell he was a positive motivating kind person who had been through this too and talked openly about it. I see the lesson in this for me. I have to do the work and it’s going to have to be on my own. I’m allowing this experience to be the catalyst. Because I’m so sad this is what my life is. I’m pushing away opportunities just to what?

(My longest in 2 years),"Since about late February, I made the decision to come clean to my family, friends, and even my employer about my drinking problem. For the past 2 years, I thought I could control my vice and keep it all a secret as long as I remained functional and reliable when needed. It was possible at first, but over the course just a few months, alcohol’s grip on me only worsened. COVID made my college classes transition to online and if that wasn’t hard enough already, my new “free time” made it so I could get a drink as early as I wanted to any day. 

I’ve failed classes, disappointed so many people, lacked at my job, and have felt hopeless. But something just clicked in February. I profoundly began to understand that my life is meant to be more than this. I’ve begun talking to a therapist, I’ve moved back in with my parents for accountability, and I’ve been kicking ass at work for the past couple of months now. I had a couple of stumbles since then but I’m proud to say the past two weeks have been 100% sober! Thank you all for this sub. I may not ever post but I’m on here every day.

Now this seems like a no-brainer. You stop drinking, you feel better overall but I mean on a deeper level. 

I never realized how much of an impact alcohol had on my mental health WHILE I WAS SOBER. It’s like even though I wasn’t drunk or hungover, there was still sort of this dark cloud around me while I was sober. After a few weeks of not drinking, my overall mental health seems so much better. 

The fact that I was always more of a social drinker and never really let it get out of hand, and yet it was still having an impact on my mental health is scary. It seems like when I was drinking, my thoughts were a lot more anxiety-riddled, more fearful, and just a bit more paranoid. Now that I’m no longer drinking, my thoughts tend to be a lot more practical, sensible and positive.

I was developing liver pain and had elevated liver enzymes. I'd burnt through 4k in savings all on booze. I was drinking every night, hating myself more and more every night wondering how I'd ever got to such a low point in my life.

I quit drinking December 12, 2020. I haven't touched a drop since. Yet now that the sun's out and there's been a big deal here in the UK about pubs reopening, even though I was only ever an 'at home on my own' drinker and never a social drinker, seeing everyone in the beer gardens has triggered cravings in me like never before.

I'd done surprisingly well until now. The first week was kinda difficult but the liver pain kept me sober through pure fear. After that, I never really thought about alcohol, or at least, it didn't consume my every thought.

I want to drink so bad today. I keep telling myself ""you've got this far, just get drunk tonight and then quit again. Just once. You can clearly do it, you've done it before so what's one night of drinking?"" and I know it's the alcoholism talking but it's so hard to resist. I know I can't just have one night of fun, stop at one glass. It's all or nothing with me. And I hate it. I wish I could drink casually. I love the feeling of being drunk and I'm jealous that other people can get drunk responsibly and I can't. I feel like I'm missing out.

I'll be giving up so much if I drink again, and I know it'll be a downward spiral. I don't know if my liver can take one night of binge drinking let alone if I end up back on the bottle again.

I've got plans for my life for the first time in years since I stopped drinking. I'm leaving my job that I hate and going back to university soon to study something I've always wanted, to end up in my dream career. I have so much riding on my sobriety.

1) I gained 30 pounds since I started drinking heavily. I started a new psychiatric medication around the same time I started drinking everyday, and the medication gives me an insane appetite. Drinking just makes my appetite and urge to binge eat SO much worse. Not to mention the empty calories that come from alcohol. I want to lose the 30 lbs I gained and then some, and this will be almost impossible for me if I don’t stop drinking. 

2) It is severely hindering my ability to control my bipolar disorder. I will NEVER get my symptoms under control if I keep drinking like this. In fact, drinking is making my bipolar symptoms significantly worse. I have to accept that if I want to recover, I need to give up alcohol. 

3) I’ve embarrassed myself way too much while drunk. Waking up hungover af, feeling physically and mentally ill, absolutely regretting what I said/did and how I acted when I was blacked out is a terrible, TERRIBLE feeling. I don’t want to keep waking up hungover, making my already fragile mental health even worse. I’ve hurt those closest to me and almost caused my relationship to end because of how I am when I’m drunk. No booze is worth losing the person I love most. 

4) THE MONEY. I waste so much friggin money on literal poison. I’m going to go through my bank account statements and tally up how much I’ve been spending on drinking (both the alcohol and the takeout I end up drunk bingeing on) each month, then write down what I could’ve spent or done with the wasted money. 

5) I just want to live my best life. Alcohol will never let me achieve that. I want to be happy and healthy and feel good. So, I need to stop drinking. 

It’s going to be incredibly hard for me, as I’m sure you all know. The cravings and urges are hella real. But I can do it! Sacrifices will have to be made and I need to practice finding willpower and self control, but it will be so incredibly worth it!!",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9250444}"

Sobriety has given me the clarity to recognize the traumas in my life, but the shame of it all still creeps up on me. Today, I'm a better person. Today, I'm able to show up for my family.

Currently maintaining sobriety at home (which is most of the time). Cutting out social drinking is the ultimate goal but has proven more difficult, about 50/50 success. Meeting friends at a brewery for lunch later and planning to just order food (beer is my least favorite of the primary monsters, so that makes it a little easier.)

Now that I'm going weeks-long stretches in between drinks, my health, stress level, sleep, and subsequent energy have all been great (yay!), but I'm starting to become concerned about the seemingly never-ending brain fog. It's almost like I'm TOO relaxed now?? 

I know the general brain-friendly recommendations while actively drinking (B vitamins, magnesium, etc) but was wondering if those still apply for several months, or if the levels are more balanced out after a few days/weeks. Has anyone had luck with other vitamins/supplements during recovery in that regard? I definitely still feel foggier than I did in my sober/non-problematic drinking days, but also I'm older now so that can't help. (Socially I'm fine, but professionally as a programmer my focus/learning ability is WAY down.) Starting a contract-to-hire position next month at a company I've always really admired, and really want to do a good job.

Again, the goal is definitely to quit drinking all together, just hoping to get some insight from people who have made it through these beginning stages of their battle.

Introduction (Never Been Brought Flowers)

I'm Mitchell.

Hi. How are you?

  I'm 39 years of age right now. I'm 5'10"" tall and weigh roughly 150-155 lbs. coming still saturated from the shower. I've been told I'm ""easy on the eyes"" or...whatever. Personally, I believe I'm the single funniest mother fucker in the room, any room, that I'm placed into; by sheer force of will, I can make anyone laugh. I skipped a ton of school (mostly third and fourth period Senior year, as they weren't AP and we're disinteresting). So, a bit of a disappointment to some teachers. Las I was tested, my IQ is 138. I love listening to people and hate when people talk too much. I adore my friends and love my family. While it's cliche to say, I would happily and readily lay down my life for either...and I mean it.

  I'm also an alcoholic. An extremely dangerous to myself one. My first ""drink"" was when I was thirteen years old. ""Heavily"" since I was 21. ""Dangerously"" since I was 28. We'll get into a lot of this later, but the last time I was hospitalized I was conscience. Remember everything. I had a BAC (blood alcohol content for the layman here) of .36. This is not something I'm proud of.

  This won't be in chronological order; stream of conscientious, mainly. Yes, there will be stories. Some will be amusing, some will be depressing and familiar. I will have sketches, I love comics and cartooning and was, for a time, paid to draw for my local paper. There will be page after page of what I've felt, what I'm feeling and what I hope becomes of me as I try again to move forward. It's always nice when an unexpected dinner awaits you when you arrive home. Hope to, at least.

  If you're (still) reading this, please note that this was written selfishly. My experiences may not be shared by you. Nor yours mine. I'll make observations, notate dates best as I can recall them. I'll share music with you that I've been listening to as I'm writing, books I'd advise you read and artists that are worth taking the time to just shut the fuck up and actually appreciate. Insights into who I am, have been and desire to be.

  I'm left handed. I live in Kentucky (Commonwealth!!!) next to a major University in South Central, Ky. I play guitar (decently) and ukulele (pretty damn well, if I may). I dress like an old man. I love graphic novels, disc golf and basketball. I love to cook but not eat. My heritage is English and Irish. I've never seen a smile that I couldn't learn to appreciate on one level or another in my entire life...truly. 

  I've never been brought flowers. 

  The simple fact that I reference that is a big part of my   problem. I'll explain later if I'm misunderstood.

  So, here we are. Since you're (still reading? This?!??) then I'll also love to hear/read about you! What do you do? What are your quirks? What is your faaaaaaaavorite color? Music? Books? Film? Art?

  What are you proud of? What what do you want to do while you still have time to do it? What would you want to be remembered as? An addict? Or...hear me out...

  An alcoholic? Or a bad ass, sword wielding, dragon slaying, princess (or prince) saving, blood soaked conquerer of evil kingdoms whose reign over your own (like mine) has long since outlasted it's welcome and must be overthrown?!?!?!
  
I get carried away. Anxiety.

  So, that's what I'm trying to figure with the writing of this...whatever it becomes. What am I? Who am I? Who are we? We can be anything. You can be anything.

Just don't talk too much. I hate when people talk too much.

It worked for a while, but then my birthday happened and my friend was in town from out of state, so I went a little overboard. And then again at mom's birthday party. And then again at a Mortal Kombat watch party.

Anyway, the last two times I drank heavily, the same thing happens - I can't fall asleep no matter how hard I try, my body feels weak, and my extremities are tingling, my skin is so hot but so cold at the same time, I have trouble urinating. The first time it happened, I thought I was dying. That was when I decided to quit.

Fast forward to today. Yesterday was when the tingling started to settle in and it was very difficult to get around. I didn't sleep a wink last night, and I was really trying. This morning, afraid of what this feeling was and whether it was related to my covid vaccine, I stumbled upon alcoholic neuropathy.

It makes so much sense. Fortunately, I caught it early. Talk about one helluva motivator to finally cut it out completely.

I thought I was solid in my decision to “just let go” a little bit. Nup, silly girl, there’s no such thing. (Feel free to skip to the end, this is gonna get long)

After two weeks of “staying in control”, on a blissfully nice child-free Saturday the little monster won and I ended up blacking out for the first time in months. Slept probably 13 hours and woke up remembering how bad a hangover is, especially when shark week decided today was the perfect time to remind me I’m not pregnant. 🤦🏼‍♀️

Anywho, so here I am again. Day 1. I’ve been on and off with recovery for the last 2 years. I’ve been a problem drinker since ‘18 and enough is enough. Even when I have control, I’m not as productive as I can be, I don’t enjoy the simple things in life, parenting is harder and my temper is always shorter. Poising myself just to “stay in control” is so freaking stupid. 

I want to be happy again. I want to love life and be the kind of parent my kid deserves. I want to have the extra money to afford things we WANT instead of literally having a booze fund. I want to be clear, mentally and emotionally, and be able to enjoy being sober and NOT feel like it’s a task.

Last night scared me. I hate blacking out, but I hate blacking out and losing half a day even more. The last thing I remember is walking home. Like the process of walking but I don’t remember getting home. I don’t remember going to bed. I don’t remember any of that. I’m grateful all this happened on a child free weekend but that doesn’t change the fact that it makes me feel like an absolute failure and a total fuck up. 

And I don’t ever want to experience another godawful black-out followed by a hangover on a Sunday morning again. I don’t want to try and tame the shakes so I don’t spill my cup of coffee all over myself again. I don’t want to ever “need” to put poison in my body again just to find peace with life. 

So here I am. Day 1. Completely determined that this time, it’s my last day 1. Because day 1 is the easy day. Day 1 is the easiest for me because I already feel like shit and don’t have the urge to drink. It’s day 2, day 6, day 16, etc that’s harder.

I just started this journey into sobriety and it’s really hard) and this big whiskey or bourbon company was doing a promotion there where they had a big truck outside and were sampling different flavors of their products. 

They were handing out the samples in these little 1 oz plastic cups. When I was in the store, I saw this man standing in a corner with what looked like 10 of these little cups placed on top a stack of beer cases. One after the other he was gulping them down—couldn’t get one down fast enough for the next. He was clearly in bad shape and a part of me wanted to go over to this guy and give him a big hug, tell him that he is going to be ok. Obviously, that would be inappropriate so I just had these thoughts of how irresponsible it was for the store to hand out free liquor in the volume they were and just felt sad about how fucked up this whole industry is. People’s lives are being ruined left and right and they are just laughing their way to the bank. 

I wish I could end this by saying I walked out of there empty handed in protest, but it didn’t go that way. Wine ended up getting the better of me again.

&#x200B;

Hey there,

&#x200B;

I'm an alcoholic. I'm not unique in that it feels wrong to use that label, especially since I haven't touched a drop of the stuff for two months on the day, but that's what I am. Always will be.

I spent a good old while under the guise of being a functional alcoholic, which by any definition (utterly incorrect as any definition of this fundamentally quixotic concept is) I probably was. I studied, then lectured at a couple of universities, graded essays, guided students through their theses, started a new career at which I excelled, even worked out 6 days per week.. and I was *happy*, at least once that first bottle of wine or, more likely, first half pint of whisky had started taking effect. 

I was also a *secret* alcoholic, in that somehow no-one managed to figure it out. I truly don't understand how I managed this, but no one ever figured out that I was constantly drunk. I do mean constantly - my morning would often consist of a hard workout coupled with a bottle of wine or the equivalent, and things would go downhill from there. That was when my drinking was at its worst, and I'd go through something like 4-5 bottles of wine, or 1.5 bottles of whisky/gin, per day. Often with a few pints thrown in on the way from one place to the other.

For some of this time I lived in a shared apartment with three others, who didn't notice. Then with a girlfriend, who didn't notice. No one at work noticed, in fact I was generally lauded for my work ethic and results. 

My drinking started as a way to escape mental anguish, and to silence my mind. I've always been an introvert, an over-thinker, and extremely self-critical. Booze is the most effective means I've found to silence that part of myself, as well as to encourage my creativity. I've done some of my best work after downing a pint of whisky, but also some of my worst. 

**The first time I quit** was without doubt the worst. This was back in those 4-5 bottles days, and I quit cold turkey. Not a great idea. I have only vague memories of the first few days, and those consist of me sitting my home office screaming into a cushion as I suffered panic attack upon panic attack. Outside of losing a sibling, it was the worst time of my life.

I stayed sober for about half a year, then slowly started back up again, because I ""had a handle on it."" Well, of course I didn't. Starting with a social beet at dinner, the quantity slowly built back up, and before you knew it I had a secret stash or two and found myself skulking into the night to rid myself of the empties in various bins away from our house. 

I've quit a good few times since, but at two months sober.. I'm doing a better job of it right now than I have in a long time.

I recently found a few audio recordings of myself on my phone. Can't remember recording them - I get pretty bad blackouts - but it was me, drunk as a skunk darting around in the night, telling myself that I have to stop drinking. I sound f\*cking miserable.

Still, I miss it. I miss the feeling of disconnecting from my mental anguish, my self-torture, my constant self-critique and inability to live up to expectations I set for myself. I miss the knowledge that just a couple of drinks can silence it all.  I also feel like I somehow performed better in life when I was drunk. Everything I have now, I secured while under the influence of enough alcohol to knock a cow dead.

I know that's irrational, and that there's nothing to say I wouldn't be even *better* off if I hadn't had more booze than blood in my body. But having spent a decade drunk, I feel like being sober I've lost a part of *me*, a part I often liked, and that many others liked. I've always felt that way about my drunk and sober self, as my sober self could often not remember conversations the drunk me had engaged in, but give me just a bottle of wine and they'll come rushing back. Now they're just lost, along with that other me, and his creativity.

This time around, I started from a place of drinking considerably less - just half a bottle of whisky a day or so - which made it easier to quit. No real panic attacks, and the wee devil telling me to drink left my shoulder after 2-3 weeks. 

The **hardest** part now is fighting this.. longing for that part of myself. I've never really experienced this before, and it's weird. I don't feel the *urge* to drink, I just feel like it.. would be nice to say hello to that old friend of mine again; me.

The devil I could get angry with, I could tell him to f\*ck off, I could go for a run and he'd leave. But this, this is different. It's softer, smoother, less oppressive, more nostalgic.

What makes it harder is that I can't share it with anyone, because that would mean admitting to them that I've lied for a decade about my drinking, and I can't do that. I would risk losing everything I have - wife, house, all of that.. but worse, even if it didn't come to losing the physical, I'd lose any respect she had for me, as well as her trust. I know I don't *deserve* that trust, but I hope I can earn it in time.

Although I have been drinking less, it is always a challenge to do so and hasn’t worked a lot of the time. 

Now that me and all my friends are vaccinated and feel safer being in public, they want to go out all the time and get really drunk. I am struggling to get back on the wagon because I want to go out and meet people and be fun and experience this new town I moved to last year.

Never really was an everyday drinker, my pattern was generally work my ass off, then Friday night -- go out for beers and then pickup smokes and more beers on the way home. Feel like shit Saturday morning, swear off drinking. Sometimes I'd just order takeout and effectively lie in bed, hoping I didn't destroy my health this time, and wishing I could change.  I'd just want that day to be over so I could log an official sober day and start my streak again. Like the movie Groundhog day, the next Friday I'd do it all over again. This pattern when on literally for many years. I became increasingly depressed because I couldn't stop. It was this never ending cycle I couldn't break. I lost 2 close friends over the past \~3-4 years and I definitely think my drinking escalated. I didn't have a ton of friends to begin with despite the fact that most people really ""like"" me. COVID certainly didn't help either as my once a week often became 2x a week.

Also, I'd say that turning 40 changed me. I felt nostalgic for when times were simpler and I have a lot more friends stuff to do. I thought of being fit and young and how well women responded to me back then. I was like a different person. I now feel defeated, 40 lbs overweight, single,  no longer confident. I stopped loving myself. I guess I felt depressed I prioritized work over all else and didn't work on my weaker areas of life, like my issues with relationships and intimacy. Now I kind of feel like the world has passed me by, as I sit in my house alone more often than not. I guess drinking helped me deal with a chronic feeling of loneliness, boredom, nostalgia. Anyways, 15 days ago I had enough of feeling like shit during my limited time off. I was exhausted physically and mentally. I would romanticize going out for an ice cold beer (I hate hard liquor and wine) after mowing my lawn. Of course, the good bird on my shoulder would tell me that one beer would turn into 10, 12, 15, whatever. I would also do something I don't do any other time: smoke cigarettes. Nasty! The last year especially I have realized how much my drinking behavior has hurt others. Mainly I'd make stupid promises to people. Make plans that seemed like a good idea at the time, but you realize the next day were putting yourself at a total imposition. Also, out of the blue, 2 unrelated women reached out to me seeking some type of relationship from me. This was after a long period of having little interest in that department, and just coincidentally happened at the same time. Sober me knew both were unhealthy to even entertain the thought of. Drunk me? Well, I started to respond! It seemed like a good idea, but both women were very vulnerable from recent heartbreak. And here I am, having to walk back plans when I came to and realized I was leading them on. I didn't really mean to, but after a few of these hot / cold sessions both really got sick of it. I feel terrible to be honest that I was so wishy washy and likely hurt / rejected them the way I did. It's really not their fault they reached out to me when I was struggling more than ever with this awful disease. I am not the same person anymore they once knew.  I guess I can't blame them for cutting me out of their life. Anyways, I think I am done ranting/raving, but I am committed to a sober life. I am actually going to the doctor in early June for a physical which I do anticipate will go okay. Well, all things considering.

2021-04-25 08:52:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/my7q1k/cannot_be_cured/,Cannot be cured.,"Coming to terms with the fact I’ll never be the same again is an emotional roller-coaster. 

At first your body floods with fear and anxious excitement as you slowly click up the steep incline to the start of the track course. Your heart is racing as you traverse the peak and you grip onto the handlebars for dear life. Akin to the way you grab the handle of the exit door of the rehab you spent drying out, the door opens and you now come flying down the tracks of your own personal roller-coaster ride. 

Flying down the tracks at full speed the anxiety, fear and excitement is at an all time peak. Everything seems new and fascinating, all while the danger looms inherently behind you. A slip of the tracks now could present a very real threat of relapse or even worse death. There is no getting off the ride once you’ve had your ticket punched.

Alcoholism is something that cannot be cured, plain and simple. The experts say its “manageable” and people can lead fulfilling lives without alcohol but the danger is always there. 

Put simply alcoholics will never be able to consume alcohol without it consuming them.

That’s an extremely hard pill to swallow and it wasn’t until my 4th year sober that I actually agreed with the above sentiment. Myself like other’s I suppose foolhardy believed that one day I could have a few beers and relax. However the longer I travelled on those roller-coaster tracks and the more I learnt about alcoholism and myself, I slowly realised such a thing was unattainable. Its such a kick to the stomach to know you’ve damaged your body and brain to the point of no return and alot of things will never be the same again.

Certain things will always be a trigger for an alcoholic and there’s no easy way around that besides learning to live with you demons and manage your lifestyle appropriately. 

Personally speaking I can’t stand the smell of beer, it literally makes my insides spin like a hurricane and sends signals to my brain so hard and fast, that it gives me immediate flashbacks. Being around people who are extremely intoxicated is another big one for me, I feel like I’m on that roller-coaster again because I see myself in that drunk person. 

A rabbit isn’t virtuous, it just can’t do anything except get eaten. Its not virtuous. If your a monster and don’t act monstrously, then your virtuous. (Jordan Peterson) 

Although I will always technically be a “recovered alcoholic” I wear that shit like a badge of honour on my chest, shoulders back and with my head held high. I have bad days, I have bad weeks even but I can take solace in the fact I know I was a monster and how monstrous I can be but I’m not that person anymore. 

Being an a recovered alcoholic I’m forever on the roller-coaster and that’s just how my life is now. 4 years without alcohol in my life but the horrific dreams, stomach churns when I smell beer or the awkward social interactions still remain. In those times it feels like I’m at the start of the tracks again, going full speed on the roller-coaster down ramp and absolutely shitting myself as I get thrown into the triple loop. However when I come out the other side of the loop, fuck it feels good. I’m proud of myself and reminded why I put the bottle down. I’m still learning everyday to manage life on the tracks I chose, but as the days and years go on I get better at enjoying the ride.

Getting sober was and continues to be the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But without a shadow of a doubt, it’s also been the best thing I’ve done by far. Being the son, brother and partner people can count on and respect is something I always wanted to give. After alot of blood, sweat and tears I’m finally in the position to achieve exactly that. Being there for my newborn niece has been a huge eye opener for me, I can’t wait to see her grow up and now I’m not a hopeless drunk I get to be apart of her life and see all those cherished moments.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.76211774}"

I wanted to drink this weekend but I went running instead,"I wanted to drink so badly on Friday. It was wild — 5 months of sobriety and clear thinking about what was best for me, and suddenly, I was ready to throw it all away. I bought a new car on Friday and the excitement of it had me buzzing and wanting to celebrate, so I started talking myself into that whole “I’m okay now, I should be able to drink. This was just an experiment after all; I’m cured” type stuff. It was scary how much I felt like a different person all of a sudden.

To get through the cravings, I vented to my SO and talked through it with him, realizing how pathetic all the rationalizations sounded. I also reached out to someone I trust about my craving and he helped talk me down as well. I went on awesome runs on Friday evening and Saturday instead, and once I had finished each run my resolve was reinstated. I knew I wasn’t going to drink.

But, this past Friday was the closest I’ve come so far to  slipping up. I miss drinking a lot right now and have had strong cravings. I think I’m in that critical phase where things have gone so well that I feel cured and have started romanticizing drinking again. But the allure is such a fucking lie. I know myself and I know all about the hangover that would be waiting for me and how just one slip up would lead to drinking on the regular again.

Anyway, it was humbling to experience all of this. In my earliest days of sobriety I was so relieved to not be drinking that I didn’t have cravings at all. But they are creeping in now and I need to be ready to deal with them. I’m feeling grateful that I didn’t drink this weekend and instead I’m 5 months sober! I also want to thank everyone on this sub. Your sharing and insight has been invaluable. I read through posts and comments here all the time. So many of you are so wise and have helped me make sense of things in order to avoid relapse.

I’m a 32M and spent my late teens and 20’s living for the weekend. I’d previously have labelled myself a classic British binge drinker. I wouldn’t drink at home too often but I’d never miss an opportunity to put 10 pints away on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday (often on all three). I somehow managed to hold down a good job and was always someone that people wanted to drink with as I was fun drinking buddy. 

However, I made so many terrible decisions whilst drunk. Drinking contributed to the breakdown in my marriage, I lost plenty of money at casinos whilst drunk and would get into precarious situations on nights out. I’ve got an 8 year old son who was the result of a drunken 1 night stand where I don’t even remember sleeping with the woman (DNA test tells me I did). 

Since I stopped drinking, the quality of my life in general has improved. Most importantly, my overall health has improved. I was diagnosed with severe gastritis before I stopped drinking. The excess acid in my stomach would cause horrible pain and vomiting every few months. For a year now I’ve had no symptoms. 

I sleep better, I no longer waste days with hangovers and I am in a relationship with someone who has never known me to be drinker. I’ve managed to save enough money for a deposit on a house and had an offer accepted a couple of weeks ago. 

My relationship with my son has greatly improved this last 12 months. I see him every other weekend and no longer have to deal with a hangover when we spend time together. I want to be a role model to him and not be the drunken idiot dad. 

This journey has been completely worth it. It’s not without difficult moments though but this group and talking to people that also don’t drink has helped greatly.

So last night I had too many drinks. Way too many and somehow decided i could drive home while completely blacked out. My friend was going to drive me but apparently I took off. She followed after me to make sure I was okay and found my car in the driveway completely smashed from the front as well as some damage underneath. I was tucked into bed unable to communicate with her as to what I hit. She drove around my neighborhood, as the car couldnt have been driven like that for long but she did not see anything that had been hit. This is in Texas btw.

This morning I still do not recall one minute of the drive. I also had to work today, so my friend drove around in the daylight to see if she could find anything I may have hit and give them my insurance info to avoid a hit and run ordeal. We believe we found it. Not on my usual route home but a route I take occasionally, it looks like may have took the turn incorrectly, jumped the sidewalk, and hit a red post in the parking lot of a business. There was bit of red paint on my car and the post is bent and also red. Also, I now dont think i hit anyone because no one has came looking for me and i know this had to have happened very close to home.. My neighbors also mustve seen my car get towed this morning and nothing has happened.

Anyway in a panic, I started the process of an insurance claim early this morning before discovering the pole. I did it online and havent spoken to an adjuster yet. Probably because its saturday. When asked for information about the accident. I was very brief but i lied about the location and I said i rear ended someone because its what it looked like and because in a rush to work this morning I didnt even realize there was damage underneath. I assumed I rear ended a parked vehicle and I planned to find it and give my insurance information. Can I tell the insurance adjuster the truth that I dont remember what I hit or details so as not to commit insursnce fraud? Should I just tell them I hit the pole like I suspect? Theres also a camera at the intersection that it happened at. Would the insurance ask the city to see it? Im so lost as to what to do here. Is there a chance I can still be arrested for a DWI or for the property damage if i did hit the pole and leave?

I’ve been drinking consistently from the age of 16. I’m 35 now. There have been phases of drinking less and drinking more (sometimes one bottle of wine a night, sometimes two) , but I’ve generally drunk to excess every day of my adult life. It’s always been a reward system for finishing a university essay, getting through a day at work or, in recent years, me and my wife finally getting our three children (inc. twins!) off to bed and having a quiet moment to ourselves. 

Something in me has changed though. I’ve felt unwell for the past year. The doctor believes I had covid last March and I haven’t been the same since: I still drank through it. Recently I’ve been getting through, at the very least, a bottle of wine a night. Then I found this community. 

For the past 2 weeks I have been winding down my drinking (was scared about some of the cold turkey stories), measuring out 300ml then 100ml of wine a night and for the past 2 nights I’ve got it down to a single measure (25ml) of gin in a very long gin and tonic. I’m feeling good, have lost a good amount of weight already, and no longer have the urges to carry on drinking through the evening. 

But the next step feels like a hurdle that I now need to get over. A single measure of gin is still a single measure of gin. I want to be completely free of alcohol. Moderation will not work for me. I suppose I just need help to make that final push to end that association with alcohol daily.

Either way, I was just wondering what your thoughts and experiences are so that I can get a better handle on where I’m at. For the last two-three years, I’ve been drinking close to 6-10 light beers a night. Not every single night, but most. I would venture to guess 5 nights a week on average. I also got prescribed adderall and purchased it from others and have been taking more than my prescribed dose most days over that same time frame. Most days, 40-80mg total and the max is 100mg which is MAYBE a once a month occurrence. The average (40-80mg) is probably 5 or 6 nights a week, over the course of the last 2 years or so. 

To be honest, I have had almost no major healthy scares, haven’t gained weight or lost weight, I’m able to do my day job (work from home, even before covid) and still perform above average (based on my quarterly and yearly reviews) as well as maintain a long term relationship (definitely some issues there, but we’re both committed to each other and I know I need to change to make things right) as well as increase my income (fairly significantly) through side projects (physical labor-based). 

Ultimately, I would like to know 1) with my “history” what are the potential side effects of cold turkey quitting? For reference, the beer I drink is 4.1% ABV and my “schedule” is as follows: Wake up around 11 or 12, work/live/recover from then until 8 or 9pm. Crack the first beer, drink from then until 2-4am depending on the night, wake up, repeat. 

I never wake up and drink immediately, outside of the one or two times a year where I am at a festival or bachelor party. It’s almost always 8 or 9pm until I have my first beer, so minimum 16 or so hours from last drink to next drink, if that makes sense. 

Also, just need some support and words of encouragement. Longest I’ve made it recently is 3 days. I did this twice in the last 4 months. Outside of that, one day is the most, and that’s fairly rare. I know this is bad, it’s excessive, it’s expensive, it’s hurting my relationship and frankly my work productivity is dropping as well. The adderall helps me feel like I have it more in control than I really do, because when I run out, I’m tired and sleeping by drink #4. That was my first warning sign recently.

They checked my blood alcohol level and it said 0.00 that was the first time  in idk how long I could say that I was completely sober.

When I went in I was at my most Vulnerable state I have ever been in and it was the most traumatizing moment of my whole life.

Today I have a lot of emotions to think where I once was a year ago. How I had let alcohol take over my life and keep me locked up in this cage I could never get out of. It put me in a place where I weak, scared, and had no voice.

When I went into the hospital I was looked at and treated like someone who was on drugs and was told over and over again I was a heroin addict because how sick I was. Shaking, unable to breathe or stand on my own the nurse could careless. After getting assessed by the nurse they took me to a room to lay down on a bed

This was the beginning of Covid and the hospital was out of masks. They had paper towels folded in half with rubber bands stapled to the sides. They put one on me when I first got there. I already couldn’t breathe as it was and they tell me to lay down to put in an IV. When I laid down the paper towels went into my mouth and nose. I was suffocating 

I sat up so I could breathe. The nurse called for for someone to come put in the IV. When someone came to help she got on the bed and held the mask over my mouth and nose making it so I couldn’t breathe at all. 

As I laid there in tears thinking this was how I was going to die. Thinking I put myself here. Making myself so weak and vulnerable I could not fight back. It was the scariest moment of my life.

She held the mask over my face she yelled “Lay the fuck down! We’re in the middle of a pandemic you little shit!” I had used my last drop of energy trying to sit up so holding me down wasn’t something she needed to do. I wasn’t fighting because I couldn’t. I was on the verge of passing out so she climbed off the table so I could breathe. Heroin

After multiple try’s they finally got the IV in. The nurse continued to say I was on heroin and treated me like it too. She asked if I was cold because I was shaking, but then told me that sucks. A doctor would come in and turn off the lights so I could rest and she would come in the room just to turn them on because a drug addict doesn’t deserve sleep. After being there for what felt like a lifetime, I finally had stop shaking and had gained some strength back. When the nurse came back in and started telling me that I was on Heroin again I used everything I had in me to yell at her “I don’t do fucking heroin!!!!” She called me a lair and left the room. 

She came back into the room and told me she had talked to my husband. My husband told her that I had a substance abuse problem. She then yelled at me saying that when someone says they have a substance abuse problem that means drugs not alcohol. She told me that alcohol is not a substance. Never once did she apologize. Never once did she even look like she felt bad. It was seriously the scariest moment of my whole life. 

Fucked up people are out there and will take advantage of you when ur that weak it’s soooo horrible. But everyone has a different path to sobriety but I pray to god yours is nothing like mine. You just gotta tell yourself your better then all this!! Don’t put yourself in the position I did, don’t make urself almost die to get sober. Do it for you, do it to be happy again, do it to feel good inside and out! I can honestly say sobriety is a beautiful thing and will make life so much better you just gotta believe in yourself.... and I believe in you... you can do this just be strong",35,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8699098}"

Happy Sunday! Welcome to the Sunday Shape Up, where we share our goals, dreams, hopes, tips, and tricks for shaping up every Sunday. 

One thing that I want to touch on this week is time. Something I've been working on saying instead of ""I don't have the time,"" is ""I'm choosing not to make the time"". When I do that, my list of excuses diminishes, preventing me from accomplishing what I want to get done. 

A couple of Sundays ago, I talked about motivation vs. discipline, and this has carried into making the 'time' or actively 'choosing' to make the time for things that I REALLY want to do in my day, and exercise is a massive part of that. But sometimes, if I wait until the end of the day to hit my yoga routine, I'm way too tired. 

So, I started moving it to the mornings - this way, I can maintain discipline, and I also know that I'll have the time because my lovely hangover-free mornings are my favorite part of the day. 

I've been a firm believer in how I start the day sets the pace as to how the day will go - and it shows! It's been a bright and cheerful week, I have more energy, and I'm currently crushing a fitness competition with a friend in Seattle on Apple Watch. It's the little things that keep me going! 

Whenever I think about starting (or stopping) new things, one of my favorite quotes come to mind:

&#x200B;

>""For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again."" -Eric Roth.

What if I had to wake up an hour earlier to attack my fitness goals with more momentum to get me to where I needed to go? I can actively choose to make the time instead of making an excuse. Now that's a use of my time, I can get behind! 😁 

How was y'all's week? Did you hit any PRs? What outdoor activities did you get into?

Before I decided to quit, they were always the big binge day. Start in the early afternoon and keep going. My relapses since deciding to quit have been on Saturday.

Today I woke up well rested and felling good. By early afternoon all I could think about was having a drink. I had things to do, so I had a plan. I had it all mapped out in my head, fully rationalized. I'd stop at the store on the way home and buy just a small bottle of whisky. 

Out of somewhere came a voice in my head asking ""what if you didn't? Imagine how good you'd feel about yourself."" On the drive home it became ""Just for the next 15 minutes, I will not drink. For the next 5, for the next 30 seconds I will not turn the car into the parking lot and drive past."" I drove past. Just like that.  I rewarded myself with some pride and sparkling water.

I am for sure concerned for my neighbor, I don’t know them well, the ambulance doesn’t usually get called for small instances. Concerning and I wish them all the health and peace in the world.

But I’ve had EMS called on me here. It was very serious that round. A suicide attempt by OD isn’t something emergency services takes lightly, as it turns out. My mental health was in the trash and the pain overcame the reason. I definitely had also been drinking. Not to the point of black out or not knowing what I was doing. I was strangely lucid. I’m sure alcohol didn’t factor positively into the situation though. 

The other time was a self harm call. A useless waste of a call but some people don’t know how to respond. To me self harm and suicide risk are two VERY different things. Regardless it was hospital city and a hold (not 72hr as it should have been) until I blew a 0.0. That was an embarrassingly long time.

Clearly my mental state hasn’t been very positive, for a hot long while. And alcohol equally “fixed” and exacerbated it. Now all the pain and shit is raining down. It’s really not easy to process or handle. Not bueno.

I’m definitely not an AA proponent but I visited a pretty fun and breezy group back on Maui. Very drop in but supportive none the less. The stoke on a new person was palpible. I’m not religious. I’m queer. I’m not the “usual” AA participant. I’m also very intellectual and science based. But damn, community counts for a lot. 

Not sure where this is going. I’m just expressing because I don’t have anyone else to bounce this experience off of. I lost my best friend/non sexual partner while back and I feel empty.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** 

Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

ALCOHOLICS: A Life Centered On Helping Others Live In Complete Sobriety!

AFGO: Another F*cking Growth Opportunity!

Good morning Sobernauts! I am super pumped to be hosting the DCI this week. A big huge ‘Thank you!’ to u/SaintHomer for doing all that you so graciously do and to u/cypress_ for effortlessly guiding us all last week. More than anything I’m beyond grateful to be here with you all. If you learn anything about me this week it’s that I love acronyms, slogans and bad words. I’ll try my hardest to keep the latter in check. 

An AFGO is Another F-ing Growth Opportunity. It’s something I leaned about in one of my cherished daily reading books (Trauma and the 12 Steps by Marich and Dansiger, a page a day helps keep the drank away.) Naturally due to the inappropriateness I really took to this one. You can also replace the bad word with ‘Fulfilling’ and I do apologize to anyone offended by this foul language :)

Regardless of if I’m in recovery or not life presents lots of different situations that I undoubtedly have to handle. Yes, it’s a heck of a lot easier to handle things if I’m sober but I still stumble at times. There are still trying days, stressful circumstances and really bad moments. Like everyone here I’ve certainly had to learn how to deal with a bunch of different things being flung my way without using booze. Everything seems so brand new and at times impossible. But it’s not impossible, it’s actually very possible because I no longer drink which gives me the opportunity to grow and be better. 

I can look at it two ways. The first is the classic ‘stinking thinking’ way. The, ‘Oh this sucks, I can’t do this, I give up, F-IT’ way. That never worked out too well for me. 

Or I can look at things in a slightly different light, ‘Oh, this is an AFGO and I can do this, I can learn from this and everything will be okay if I just don’t drink today.’ This second approach is possible because I’m no longer religiously poisoning myself and drowning in self hate. And as time goes on those AFGO’s become a lot less scary and frankly quite empowering. Time, work, patience and boom! Everything gets a lot easier to manage without alcohol. Quitting drinking truly made my life reasonable again. Yes, there is still an occasional meltdown but I can deal with whatever life throws at me because I’ve been given the gift of sobriety, serenity and peace of mind.

Basically, every day I choose not to drink is an AFGO. And as I learn the invaluable lesson of letting go and acknowledging that some things are just an AFGO it all becomes so much easier and a bit less daunting. 

So, have you recently had an AFGO that you’re proud of? A stressful, fearful, or overwhelming situation that you courageously overcame without using the crutch of alcohol? I’m sure if you’re here reading this and pledging ‘IWNDWYT’ than the answer is “Yes!” So for that I’m very, very, proud of you. 

Some quotes...

“Be not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still.” -Chinese proverb 

“Tears are like rain. They loosen up our soil so we can grow in different directions.”- Virginia Casey (Each Day a New Beginning)

“To do nothing is failure. To try, and in the trying you make some mistakes and then you make some positive changes as a result of those mistakes, is to learn and to grow and to blossom.”- Darlene Larson Jenks

Other 4 kids in car, including driver, all survived and only sustained minor injuries. The 17 year old driver of the car was drunk and was arrested.

This whole situation is such a mind fuck. SOOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE’S LIVES WERE RUINED because someone got drunk and got behind the wheel of a car. This didn’t have to happen and is so unfair.

I cannot imagine the absolute hell my coworker is going through. We are not tight friends but we’re friendly and she’s always been very kind to me. I remember her going on and on about her 3 daughters, especially her oldest, on many occasions. They are/were everything to her.I can’t stop thinking of her. 

Fuck alcohol. Fuck getting drunk or catching a buzz. Fuck our culture for glamorizing it. Fuck that dumb ass equation, fun = alcohol. Fuck. It. All. So many lives have been permanently damaged or have ended senselessly, painfully, and/or abruptly because of that poison.

Im kind of feeling bad and I don't really know where I could adress my issue.


I used to drink twice a week, around 2 bottles of wine per drinking session. 
I never thought it was a real problem but I was sick of having terrible hangovers and living in a haze nearly half of the week.
2 weeks ago, I've decided to quit smoking and since it's really hard for me to say no to a cigaret when I'm drunk,  I have also decided to quit drinking.
I wear nicotine patches 21mg and haven't touched a cigarette since.
Anyways, everything was going fine, sometimes a lil hard without smoking but things were bearable, until 2 days ago. 
I have started to have a lot of anxiety and sadness and I don't even know why. 
Sure I am dealing with some stressful situations but it's not something that horrible. I used to be somebody that is upbeat and always face problems in an optimistic and logical way.
I don't understand why now i am feeling so stressed... It's worse around the evening, my heart starts racing and I have headaches. I also feel really down. 
My question is, can it be linked with the fact that I have quit drinking? Even if I used to drink only twice a week and often, not to the point of having black outs?

This is my first post here, and using a throwaway because I'm still very extremely cautious about opening up to the world about my problems.

Apologies in advance because this just became a bit of a brain dump and is far too long, whilst also being far from everything I've wanted to talk about on the subject. I think everything I've said here has been probably done to death but it feels important for me to say it outloud after all this time. 

To try and summarise over a decade of alcohol abuse in a few lines:
I've been drinking pretty consistently since I was around 20 (now 33). What may have initially started as social drinking turned into regular drinking alone - as a teenager it was a few drinks over the weekend (somehow always with cringy photos sent to friends to prove I was the cool one who got drunk....). At university this extended to every couple of days picking up a new 6-pack of beer, and occasionally a bottle of whisky or gin depending on the mood.
I calmed down a bit in the years after that, the biggest period being making a major effot to lose weight, but as seems to be the case for many this insidious disease doesn't just go away and in the last few years it picked up steam.
My life has changed a lot in the last 5 or 6 years. I met the love of my life, now my wife; moved cross-country to start a new career that I've been lucky to be very successful in; and generally have what would be considered a great life. 

But the drinking never stopped. Most recently I was consuming on average around 700ml of Vodka a day, often more when combined with wine. 

I don't know what was different about my latest attempt to stop, but sometime in January something switched in my mind and I decided ""fuck it, I'm done"". Since then, I've enjoyed 96 days where my first thought in the morning, to the last at night, hasn't been ""do I have enough in the house to drink?"". I cannot admit to have been completely sober during this time, having the occassional drink (singular) on the weekend, but for the first time in longer than I can recall, I don't want to drink and haven't done so in secret.

I feel more alive. I feel able to take on the challenges of life, and my work. The thing that scares me most is the list of things that previously plagued my life, including:

- Waking up at 3am, in a cold sweat, heart pounding. Then at 4am. Then at 5.... Rolling around uncomfortably, unable to ever get back to sleep

- Gagging every time I tried to brush my teeth in the morning - regularly to the point of throwing up and needing to brush all over again

- Feeling my liver. Being constantly aware it is there because you can feel the pressure of if and the pressure under your ribs

- The general bathroom problems (apologies - will refrain from any graphic detail!) - going constantly. Regularly explosively upset stomach and nothing solid for months at a time

- Constant Anxiety. Drinking alcohol causes me anxiety. It's not the only cause, but it's one of the biggest. This should really be at the top of this list for me in many ways as it's been the obvious symptom for most of my life 

Quitting drinking has has unbelievable effects on all the of above, and so much more that I can't even get down into words.


Why did I start writing this?
Well, tonight my wife, who I would consider a 'normal' drinker went out for the first time in months to meet up with some co-workers for drinks. She was only planning to have a couple and come home quickly because we had a fancy dinner planned, but after 3 hours she stumbled in through the door barely able to stand after 'only' 4 glasses of wine, and a drink of something else she can't remember. She then spent 3 hours hunched over a toilet before even feeling well enough to lie down in bed. 

I'm not going to give her shit for it - I think she was genuinely thrown by the effect of that much alcohol after months of not going out due to COVID restrictions, but it did make me think about how much I used to drink, and how 'normal' that was. I was consuming around a bottle of vodka a day, and still 'functioning' well in my job, and life; with no one giving any indication they could tell. Seeing my wife suffering so much because of a few drinks was difficult to watch, and did nothing but remind me that I don't want to go through any of that myself again. 

I don't know what the point of this post is other that just saying a lot of this openly for the first time - I hope you'll all forgive me for rambling on.",20,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4576566}"

Anyways my stomach was hurting so bad that I had to use a suppository and then the waste clogged my toilet. It’s been clogged for over 24 hours. I called emergency maintaince today 5 hours show. I leave to play volleyball with some people on meet up. When I get back I thought the issue would of been resolved....well guess what, it’s not!!! It’s still clogged. So I call the Maintance guy and he says he’s on his lunch break and will be there in 1 hour...geee great. So here am I all sandy and embarrassed. The Maintance guy said that this is the third time my toilet has been clogged and also said that no one else in my building has complained about it. 

So now I feel disgusting and embarrassed about my bowel movements. :( and it’s always going to be in the back of my head...worrying about going to the bathroom and that it will clog my toilet. Ugh this sucks :( I feel like gross and embarrassed...has anyone else ever dealt with this?

Anyways these kinds of embarrassing issues just want me to drink so I can numb the pain of life. I don’t want to worry about this anymore but it’s always gonna be in the back of my mind...
Anyways just wanted to rant thanks for listening to my shitty story :(",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.97132534}"

I couldn't figure it out:  I quit smoking more than two years ago, and it hasn't been all that hard.  I mostly haven't missed it or wanted to smoke, even in the early days, yet now I'm having pretty strong urges to smoke at least once a day.  What is that?

I think I figured it out today.  I'm having a nice, calm Saturday, just puttering around the house in PJs, doing some crafting, pampering myself a little with some skincare, etc.  The smoking urge keeps hitting me even though this is the most relaxed I've been in maybe 20 years, and I finally realized... it's not really a cigarette I want, any more than I really wanted all the alcohol I poured down my throat.  What I want is relief.  I want that feeling you see on TV, the one you hear friends talk about, that ""ahhhh, now I can unwind"" sensation. And since I'm newly committed to sobriety, that urge is manifesting as the desire to smoke.

It finally, *finally* dawned on me:  I've been chasing that feeling ever since I was a kid. 
 When I started self-harming at nine, I was chasing relief.  I was chasing it when I had my first cigarette at 11. I was galloping toward it when I took my first drink at 12. And it's never worked.  I never feel that unwinding sensation.  I never relax.  *It doesn't work.*

This is a pretty shitty (and, I know, unoriginal) realization.  I feel sad -- just stupidly, ridiculously sad -- that I'll never find the relief and relaxation I've been chasing for so long.  It isn't real, or if it is, it isn't for me.  It's not *in* me. Bummer.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.54569703}"

**TLDR: I quit drinking and now I’m about to achieve my life-long dream.** 

Hi. I’m Amber and I’m a recovering fuck up. For most of my adult life, I was the very definition of “wasted potential” (my words). As a child, I spent most of my free time reading, learning, and generally enjoying my privileged life. I grew up wanting desperately to enter the medical field, either as a doctor or a nurse. Right out of high school I was accepted into a good university and was well on my way. I was going to be a success! 

Enter alcohol. 

It creeps up on you. I was nearly 20 before I took my first drink, but man oh man did I ever make up for lost time. By the time I was 23, I had dropped out of college, entered the restaurant industry as a bartender, and moved halfway across the country to be with a man who told me he loved me (spoiler alert - he didn’t). 

I was the “correct” kind of bartender (eye roll). I worked at places that received James Beard nods; the kind of places that had publicists. I was making close to six figures (at times) and had health insurance! I earned my sommelier certifications, studied craft beer like it was actually important, and spent my free time either drinking, or thinking about drinking. My home bar was approximately 100 bottles deep - all in the name of ""research"". Through it all, I told myself that I was on the right path — that there was a good future for me in bartending. I told myself that I didn’t have a drinking problem because I drank the “proper” brands; the person buying the $60 bottle of wine clearly can’t have a drinking problem. People with drinking problems don’t have Certified Specialist of Wine credentials, right?

RIGHT?!

Well it turns out that there are many different ways to have a drinking problem. I just happened to find one of the expensive ways. 

One day (May 7th 2019 to be exact), I decided I had enough. The night before, I had picked a very big, very stupid fight with my poor husband after I’d had a few too many. As these things often do when alcohol is involved, things escalated and I woke up the next morning terrified that I was about to fuck up literally the best thing that ever happened to me. I had a great marriage with a truly wonderful man (the only man that has ever loved me as I deserved to be loved), and I was fucking it up because I liked wine. 

So I quit. Right then and there. I woke up that morning, a little hungover and full of regret. It was a weekday and I had a hangover. Not classy. 

The first week or so was a bit of a struggle, but my mind was made up and I never really physically craved alcohol after that (all my thanks to Annie Grace and, later, Holly Whitaker). There were, of course, mental and emotional cravings, but those were fleeting and manageable. Almost immediately, life got easier, brighter, a little more clear. The “pink cloud” came and went dozens of times over that first six months, but I never allowed myself to get complacent. 

For the first six months or so of my sobriety, I was still working with alcohol. I’d moved on from bartending, but I was working in the wine industry. It’s not so much that I felt a trigger to drink; more like wine had lost its sheen - it wasn’t something I thought was cool anymore. I needed to do better. 

So I went back to school. For 18 months I toiled away at difficult pre-reqs and entrance exams. I discovered that I’m actually an excellent student, particularly in math and science. Drinking had completely dulled that part of my brain - for years. In February, I officially applied to nursing school and hoped for the best. Nursing school is incredibly difficult to get into, and though I was optimistic, I didn’t want to pin all of my hopes in case it didn’t work out. My sobriety is too important. 

Today, I received my acceptance letter in the mail and cried like a god damn baby. What’s more - I managed a full scholarship so I can begin my second act without the burden of student debt.

This comes at the end of a 2 month relapse. I was sober for 8 months prior to this relapse and a few years ago I had 18 months sober. Not my first rodeo..

This relapse wasn't gradual, I went right back to my worst habits. So much Vodka and so many problems. Waking up to find my place a mess, things broken with no memory. Walking back to liquor stores I was just at a few hours ago and feeling the judgement of the young clerks. I got in an uber one night to go to a open late liquor store and I didn't realize how fucked I was until I got in the car, I could hardly talk and I felt so small and ashamed. 
I drove under the influence a couple times and I absolutely hate that so much. It's suppose to be against my principles!

Last week I woke up on the floor with no memory of how I got there. I got up and crawled into bed. Couple hours later I wake up and realize I'm all scrapped up on my back. I think I collapsed while leaning against the kitchen counter. I also discover that I have texts from my family saying they are worried about me. I said something in our group chat while blacked out and then I exited the chat so was unable to see what I wrote. 
I had to ask my brother what I did and waiting for his reply was torture (Did I say something that sounded suicidal? Did I say something mean or nasty? or was it just gibberish?)....apparently I said ""I am hurting so much and nobody listens""

This is what my drinking leads to and I know that if I don't stop my life will spiral out of control.

My dad got his knee replaced 2 weeks ago so I went back home to help him out until he could get back moving. Literally did everything for him (driving him around, manual labor on the farm)... you name it. I did my absolute best to be of service and take care of everything. Yesterday afternoon, he wanted to ride the mule (machine, not animal) around the place because he was feeling better; I just said I didn’t think it was a good idea and that I was uncomfortable riding with him (lots of steep inclines on the place and he was on painkillers). He basically blew up on me so I left and drove 8 hours back to my place. I’ve never wanted a drink more badly than on that drive home....

Anyway, I don’t think I did anything wrong and tried my best to just be of service while he couldn’t get around. It just seemed unfair that I feel this way; it’s uncomfortable.

Just wanted to check in. It's super nice here on the east coast today and I'm so glad I was able to step out and enjoy the weather a little.

It's been almost a week since I've drunk alcohol to get drunk. I say that because I did drink on tuesday and wednesday, but both times it was under Naltrexone, and I had to force myself to finish a 25oz can. It was disgusting. Just like alcohol should be. I'm so grateful it was disgusting because when I think about drinking right now, I want to gag rather than run for the drink.

So I'm not sure if I should have said today is day 3 or not, but I didn't reset my personal counter because I hated every second of the drink (mostly) and wanted to stop. I mostly did it because I wanted my brain to learn a new association with booze.

Either way! I'm so happy to be sober today all! I'm tired and have had anxiety, but it's amazing to feel the air and sun in your face and enjoy it! When I was drinking, I resented it. It's amazing to be able to eat and remember how it tastes. To do a task and not forget, and know you tried your best.

I stopped drinking 4 months ago and he stopped last October and has been on and off drinking since then. He goes 2-3 weeks without drinking, he feels great, confident is up and so is his self worth, but then something happens and he becomes overwhelmed and turns to alcohol. He hides it from me but then ends up telling me because he can’t stand it any longer. He wants help and is at the point where he understands that he might not be able to do this on his own. He told me 2 days ago that he’s been sneaking drinks and is sick and tired of living like this. His self worth is so low right now and he’s full of shame and embarrassment. 

Yesterday I suggested therapy and he suggested maybe in patient rehab. I’m not opposed to the rehab but I’m afraid he’s going to get stuck with a 30k Bill and then relapse again because of the financial stress. Neither one of us has medical insurance so that is not an option. I want to help him so bad but I know this is something he needs to do on his own. 

How can I help? We do yoga and meditate every day when we are together but once he’s alone all those bad feelings creep in and he becomes overwhelmed and drinks. 

I’m trying very hard to keep his addiction separate from myself because I want him to figure this out on his own so he doesn’t become dependent on having someone else around to help him. Personally I’m doing ok, I have my own therapist and I’m keeping my boundaries. But I love him so much and I want to help him get help. Any advice would be wonderful.

It’s new and interesting and emotional and difficult, and I’m a bit obsessive about it (because that’s how addiction and early sobriety works, apparently). But anybody else’s response feels more like, “Uh huh, yeah. That’s cool.” And that’s fine on the surface, I’m not particularly offended. But it’s superficial, and I’m craving a more fulfilling connection around it. 

I don’t mean that in a “wanting to talk to a therapist” sense, though I do have a new therapist. I just wish I had someone to connect with on a deeper level who is also embracing sobriety ALSO after realizing their substance use disorder. I can’t think of a single person in my life that falls into this category. People I know either do not understand substance use/abuse, haven’t struggled with it themselves, or have struggled with it but are still definitely in the middle of embracing the abuse of substances. It makes me quite hesitant to attempt to connect with those factors at play. 

Maybe I’m just lonely right now, who knows. At least I have my pup to keep me company and support me through this, and for that I am grateful.

Since then, I’ve gone through a personal revolution from, “I’ll take a break for a bit” to “21 days breaks habits!” (It doesn’t) to “no, it’s 60 days to break the habit” to “I need to commit to this forever.”

My wife is also a heavy drinker. In the past, her drinking exploits have surpassed my own. I can remember leaving parties we’d gone to completely disgusted with her behavior and wondering if our marriage would survive the next day. 

We’ve been together about 30 years - married for 22. We started our lives together in high school in the band nerd club - didn’t drink, poo-pop’s the kids who did.

With my move to sobriety, I’ve been opening more and more up to my wife. I’ve told her about the path to choosing permanent sobriety. I show her the books I’m reading, tell her about posts I’ve read on here. She listens and at one point even told me she’s proud of me.

She has also mostly stopped drinking but does not talk about it at all. In our most recent heartfelt discussion, I shared with her that I would like her to join me in sobriety. We talked about those parties and she agreed that she has not been healthy.

My question - how do I help her? As far as I can tell, she hasn’t made a decision. In the meantime, she’s white knuckling it, constantly angry and unhappy - hair trigger anger. I post this sitting on the couch. I was sharing some reading I was doing and talked about how I’m looking forward to reading Naked Mind which I’d just ordered on Amazon. Her response was not one of support but annoyance at me ordering on Amazon instead of a local book store.

Fast forward 5 minutes and I’m sitting on the couch alone and she has stormed off elsewhere in the house.

- gotten 2 promotions
- Moved to a new city
- Left a relationship that wasn’t adding to my life (tho still in an awkward roommate situation for another week 😬)
- Started a MS program 
- Gotten to my most fit body ever
- Secured my own apartment that I can decorate exactly how I want 
- Saved lots of money
- Saved lots of calories that I instead spend on white cheddar popcorn 

I’ve also done lots of reflecting on why I developed an unhealthy relationship with alcohol in the first place. 
- My family drinks a lot. My mom has 2-3 glasses of wine maybe 3 nights a week. My dad has 2-4 drinks about 5 nights a week. They are both successful, pretty physically fit, fun to be around people with full lives and fun hobbies. I thought this amount of drinking was the norm until 2 years ago when I saw that bar graph showing how much people actually drink on average. 
- My dad knows he has a slightly problematic relationship with alcohol. When he started noticing I was drinking a lot he taught me “tricks” to not drink too much, like bringing a pen out with me and making tallies on my hand to keep track of my drinks. He is also the main figure in my life who taught me it’s “cool” to drink, and more importantly it’s impressive to show how much you can handle your liquor. The more you can handle shows how “strong” your brain is. 
- Through high school and the beginning of college, I drank like a normal person. But I was also in an abusive relationship that gradually tore down my self esteem. 

I started drinking for bad reasons: 
- I made poor choices when I drank so I would drink when I wanted a night to be “fun” and drink more if it wasn’t “fun enough”. 
- I was less sexually inhibited when I drank, so I would be willing to do whatever a guy asked. This would make me “cool” and “desirable”, and more importantly always saying yes would assure I was never raped. 
- Being drunk would make whatever mediocre/selfish/poor quality sex I was having more enjoyable. I wouldn’t notice or care that it wasn’t good, and thus avoid making conflict my relationships. 

In my most recent relationship, which wasn’t abusive like my 2 previous ones, but in which he was selfish, entitled, lazy, and I felt like his mother/maid, we started having issues with me not being satisfied with our sex life as soon as I got sober. He thought it was unfair that I was all of a sudden unsatisfied with lazy/selfish/mediocre sex I had been okay with for the previous 1.5 years. When I thought about it I realized the last time I had amazing, passionate sex sober was in 2016, in the first abusive relationship before it got really bad. I definitely need to put work into learning how to have healthy sex. 

Over the past 400 days, I have come a long way. I trust my intuition. I trust the reality that I experience. I trust my capabilities. I have gained immeasurable self respect. I still have work to do on addressing some of the issues I’ve brought up here, but I feel capable to do that work. A lot of this has been over the past 400 days, but a lot has been over just the last 4-5 months. Even looking at my past posts, it’s clear I had not realized some of the reasons contributing to my unhealthy relationship with alcohol that I now have the language to talk about. 

I am honestly worried that after ending this most recent relationship that I got sober during I will go back to my old ways, my old reasons for drinking. And it took a lot of time for me to be sure I was leaving the relationship for good reasons, not just so I can drink again. (He is the only person who knows how bad my drinking was and that I stopped drinking. My best friend knows I used to drink a lot and recently cut back a lot/got into fitness more. But like my parents I’ve always been pretty physically fit, successful, had a full life, etc.)

As I start dating again I need to constantly remind myself that if I can’t converse with someone while sober, they’re not the person for me. If sex isn’t amazing with someone sober, they’re not the person for me. If they need me to drink on a first date to prove I’m “fun” or “cool”, they’re not the person for me. 

As I work through all this, I’ve thought about adding some alcohol back into my life. I feel resentful at the reasons that led me to having an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. I want to be able to work through these issues and solve them. I want to be able to go out dancing with friends and get drunk like once a year. 

In the logical part of my brain I am perfectly okay with the idea of being a slightly imperfect person. I’ve realized 99% of the things that most people drink during I can fully enjoy perfectly sober. And I’m thankful for that, and I generally really enjoy being sober. But if dancing my butt off in public once or twice a year doesn’t make that list, that’s something I could be okay with. I want to be able to travel to Tuscany and start chatting with an old Italian man in a cafe a have him recommend a winery, then go check it out and taste some wine. 

There are certainly unhealthy reasons to drink, many of which I’ve done in the past. There are also reasons to drink which are “meh” and I’ve decided I don’t want to drink for those reasons (eg it’s Friday, I am hanging out with friends, I’m on a date). But there are also reasons for drinking that, trying to think critically about my life and who I want to be, I would be okay with. 

I know that having had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol might have ruined that last category of reasons for me, but I really don’t want that to be the case. I want to be able to work through my issues so that I can drink, in a responsible amount, every once in a while, for good reasons. 

In general the philosophy I try to live life by is that since we each have one life and just disappear from existence when it’s over, I should try to get the most happiness utiles out of life as possible. Drinking too much too frequently was not maximizing my happiness. But drinking once or twice a year in order to enjoy a night of dancing with friends would. And I do not want my past to preclude me from that. 

But, nothing is for sure and I’m still taking it one day at a time. I’m also insanely busy for the next few months so this really isn’t an imminent issue. If you’ve read this far, thanks for reading my rant/journaling.",51,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5025021}"

i felt worse. and i mean really bad and 8 months after. i tried everything to feel better. it turns out i was self medicating with alcohol, to my surprise. my brain needed the serotonin and dopamine it provided just in a healthy way. well, 3 weeks ago i finally started a basic ssri and i feel better than i have in years. sure alcohol had that super high for a few hours but then the following lows. now, i just feel consistently good without the expense and negative consequences of alcohol and honestly the sober good feels so much better than the drunk good did. i'm happy in little ways all day.

so, in short, a shout out: if you've quit and still don't feel great, consider it. i wish i would have done this years ago. my mood is so much better, my thinking so much clearer, less negative, more hopeful, less anxiety, i could go on. i still feel like me, still can feel happy or sad or angry but it's much more balanced. just like some people need to supplement with vitamins or various other meds some peoples brains aren't making enough serotonin and/or dopamine on their own and the wonders of the 21st century are that we now have truly superior alternatives to alcohol to raise them. there is zero shame in it.

oh, also, i didn't have much for cravings but every once and a while i would. now, that's totally gone. the thought of having a drink actually revulses me. i'm so happy without it, i have no need to endure any negative parts of drinking and i'm like 'why would i even do that to myself?' no thanks.

I received my second moderna vaccine on Tuesday and it knocked me on my ass for two days. Fever, chills, headache, fatigue etc... Then yesterday I feel mostly normal and decide to go to the gym. I’ve been fasting before workouts so I did the same yesterday. I lifted weights for about 35 mins then got on the elliptical. And within 5 mins my heart rate was very high and I got dizzy. So I stopped and left the gym figuring I just needed to eat. But this sent my anxiety through the roof. I drove to an AA meeting and sat in the parking lot just shaking and super anxious. I decided I couldn’t wait 30 mins for the meeting so i went home. Pure panic the whole way home thinking I’m gonna pass out and crash. Make it home. Eat some fruit and oats. Then I start noticing my stomach doesn’t feel normal. It feels like I’m sucking in or something. 

Found out that my wife may need neck surgery the day before so I’ve been trying to be strong for her and she’s terrified of becoming paralyzed. 

Wife’s brother is going through child custody issues and she called him on our way down to her dads and that sent my anxiety through the roof. 

We went to dinner with her dad and they ordered a bottle of wine. I got club soda. Man I wanted some wine. I knew it would stop the anxiety. I resisted and they know I’m trying to stay sober. Stuffed my face and then we still have to go meet her friend who’s in town for a night. 

We get to hotel he’s staying at and they start drinking beers by the pool and I didn’t even have a water so I felt extra tempted, but I resisted again. Sprinkle some social anxiety in there. Then we need to leave cause I am supposed to work this morning at 6am. It takes the valet almost an hour to get my car. More anxiety on the way home. Wife can’t drive cause she is drunk. 

Get home and just feel completely defeated, worried about stomach issues, am I having more side effects from vaccine? Did the fever do some damage? Did taking Tylenol on empty stomach mess me up? And now I need to get up at 5am for work. Slept horribly. Up every hour. 4am wake up drenched in sweat. 5am I call work and take a sick day. 

I know this is such a ramble but this is what anxiety does to me. And without alcohol I struggle to shut it off. So I’m just writing this to put myself out there and hope somebody can relate to it. I know I’m not that special and my problems are mostly insignificant but man if you suffer from anxiety the dumbest things can become the biggest problems. 

I’m going to take it easy today. No workouts. I’m going to eat normal meals. Read my book and relax. And hope for a better tomorrow. Alcohol would just put a band aid on a gushing wound.

I've (f28) been sober for almost 4 months now, which has been great. I had been drinking at least a bottle of wine or 4 beers a night, so not excessive, but I would get cravings and headaches by 3pm most days. It was effecting my work, friendships, relationship, and mental health (I have ADHD/ anxiety), so I stopped. 

Covid has been very isolating since I live abroad and haven't been home in a year and a half... I also haven't seen friends a lot and work from home. My friends have stopped inviting me to things since I quit drinking which has been really hard. 

Last night I went to a gathering of my boyfriend's friends (about 6 people) and it started out nice when everyone was maybe 1-3 beers in, but then it just progressively got worse the more drunk they got. Everyone took MDMA (other than me, I smoked a tiny bit of weed), and all I could do is look around and watch everyone loving each other, bonding, and I just felt like an alien.

At one point my boyfriend yelled out ""aren't you glad you're here to experience this? You're the one who begged me to invite you, so here it is!"". It was meant as a joke I guess but it was super embarrassing and made it feel like I wasn't wanted there in the first place... I didn't beg to be invited, his flatmate mentioned the party while we were all cooking, so later I brought up to my boyfriend that it was weird that he never invited me to things since I quit. 

I guess this is why.

Anyways, it was a horrible night and today I feel emotionally hungover so I'm going to drown my frustration in a lasagna. 

(TLDR): 

Feeling unwanted and lonely as a sober person. How the hell do I stop feeling like I'm from another planet in gatherings with alcohol/ drugs? Do I cut ties with everyone I know in a foreign country, or just go on feeling like an alien?",10,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6780684}"

In this last year so many good things have happened, my life has done a complete 180. I can't even imagine wanting to drink again. I had a bit of a situation a couple weeks ago where I grabbed a cup from my SO's side table and I swear it was one of those slow motion ""NOOOOOOOO"" moments as he said ""don't drink that!"" and immediately before I swallowed I knew that it was a captain coke and I spit it back into the cup. So besides the fact that it majorly crossed a boundary I have established with him that he ask before drinking around me (this is like year 5 of the journey, I accepted being okay with some drinking in front of me a long time ago - personal comfortability choice) BUT the key words there being ASK BEFOREHAND. That situation could have been avoided if I had a heads up about it. I felt really weird because I hadn't had that taste in my mouth in so long and the thought ""I could just swallow it"" crossed my mind. **But I didn't**. I knew I had [this](https://imgur.com/a/Qm0tZXl) on my keychain, I knew I had a drug test at my sober house a couple days later....but honestly the biggest part was the second half of that thought was **""I just don't want to.""**  


A year ago I was throwing up so much my esophagus bled from relapsing while on Naltrexone and living on my dad's couch newly divorced and depressed as shit and everytime I detoxed I was in the hospital for at least a week because I was at 25% liver failure and having withdrawal seizures and hallucinations.  


Today I'm a supervisor at my job, I just nailed an interview to transfer to a different city and accepted that, I interviewed last night with a random ""roommate wanted"" find on like page 17 of FB Marketplace before I signed a lease for a studio apartment I could afford, but not comfortably...and she wants to meet me in person Sunday (And we're so similar it's actually kind of scary, I think I found a great friend regardless of if she picks me to live with her)  


My SO and I are in a much better place, I'm actually now officially dating my ex-spouse again so it feels weird to call him ""boyfriend"" again haha. We sat down and had an adult conversation with my expectations. I was able to soberly explain to him why I wasn't okay with what happened. Something pretty similar happened last time I relapsed, I told him no alcohol in the house and I came home to find it in the freezer and I relapsed almost out of spite. When he caught me told me he didn't care where I went but I needed to leave, threw my shit in garbage bags, and I was across the country from all my friends and family, so my wonderful father flew out to me and drove me and all the stuff I could fit in my car back to my home state. I took a step I never took before and moved into sober living after attending rehab again (like the 22nd time.)   


I'm the president of my sober house now. I'd highly encourage anyone reading this who has reached that rehabilitation step to consider sober living. Yeah, it kinda sucks to have rules and curfews again....but the support and accountability were immensely important to me making it past this first year on my own.  


Regardless of if it's with this girl I interviewed with (fingers crossed) or the backup studio apartment I can sign on, I'm moving out of sober living and transferring back to a city closer to my sober friends from high school (I'm 26, we're all pretty close still) and taking that next more independent step on June 1st. I'm just excited to see what the next year has to offer. In 6 more months I can start the process of getting on the transplant list with my doctor (about 25% cirrhosis here) and they have everything geared up to go, I just need to hit that 18 month mark.

I went 45 days without any of these substances and I felt great and felt like it had finally clicked for me after about a year of attempting to quit.

However recently here in the UK, its been pretty warm weather and beer gardens and pubs have opened back up; which means a hell of a lot more alcohol on display when I go for my walks. There is literally alcohol being consumed EVERYWHERE and I feel like subconsciously every time I see it it's reinforcing that little devil on my shoulder saying surely it can't be THAT bad if everyone else is doing it?

This led to me a couple of nights ago thinking what the hell and got myself a four pack of beer (turns out my body can't handle that much poison anymore) followed by another six pack the following night and a couple of drinks last night. This also led to me going back to my other vices mentioned above.

I'm a pretty young guy (21) and really wasn't that far along the dependence scale when I was attempting to quit; i'd maybe heavily binge drink on the weekends (quite often alone) etc but never got to the point of total dependence. 

I feel like the worst part about it for me is not necessarily just the hangover/process of drinking (money, time and pride lost) but rather the inner turmoil, guilt and shame I feel after. It's the fact that I read multiple books on alcohol in attempts to quit, try and build a good routine and coping mechanisms so i don't turn to alcohol but I can't quite seem to make it click and seem to slip up every couple days/weeks.

It's just a really frustrating cycle for me when I really do feel like I try and put as much effort into quitting as I can, and then within a few days/weeks when i've forgotten how bad alcohol actually is or i'm feeling back to myself I slip up again.

I just feel quite lost at the moment and it'd be really helpful to discuss this with others who feel the same way about alcohol as me. I know my life is more fruitful, healthy, vibrant, peaceful, balanced etc without alcohol but there's some part of me that still wants it as a coping mechanism for when i'm feeling stressed.  And then the stress I feel the next day and how hard on myself I am just exacerbates the problem the next day. 

If anyone has any tips on journalling, managing cravings etc that'd be great. Thank you.",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6058163}"

But...","I (25f) decided to write this because I recently did a training at work where alcohol abuse is described as more than 3 drinks per occasion or 7 drinks per week.  I am obviously way outside of these parameters… but so are all my friends.

I also recently realized that I’ve been spending somewhere around $500-$600/mo on alcohol which is literally 25% of my income. Lately my drinking has caused me to spend more than I actually make so it’s cutting into my stimulus check savings… I told my cousin who says I deserve to treat myself with my stimulus money.

I drink every day, at least 3 drinks but usually upwards of 6. Not sure how long this has gone on for, maybe 8 months? Started drinking in 2018 and it slowly got worse. The last three months I’ve been going to the bar alone when I can’t find someone to join me. My usual bartender made a comment the other day along the lines of, “I remember when you used to come in with your friends and just have 2 beers.” I black out more than once per week and often don’t know how I got home - usually I find out I drove. I am having unprotected sex. I am going home with strangers. I am coming to work hungover… but when I tell my coworkers that I went out again last night or hooked up with some guy off of Tinder, they cheer and tell me I’m living my best life. 

I saw a post today by u/nancy5559 titled “I don’t know who needs to hear this, but yes, that upper right quadrant pain is your liver, and you need to stop drinking, NOW” It reminded me of how I told a friend the other day that I was getting weird pains and was concerned for my liver due to how much I drink… he brushed it off as nothing because, “you aren’t drinking THAT much.”

I have been challenging myself to stay sober and do regular self-care when I get home from work, but I always end up stopping to get beer on the way or sitting in my apartment for like 20 minutes before leaving for the bar. Drinking before noon on weekends is a given. I keep telling myself to do something different but I never do. All of the different flavors of Gatorade and sparkling water I bought to substitute fore booze are untouched in my fridge.  But... “It’s how a lot of us cope in this industry, even though we all preach against it” my boss told me.

I still am having trouble admitting there is something wrong here, and everyone around me keeps normalizing it. I think part of it is that I haven’t really suffered yet due to my drinking – no DUIs, no sexual assault, no health problems, no lost jobs, no ruined relationships, no debt. The first step in AA involves admitting that my life has become unmanageable, but I’m a straight A student, working full-time in a very difficult job, living on my own and paying for all of my expenses, and generally functioning. Plus, everyone else seems to think I’m fine…

I would go on to relapse multiple times after short stints of sobriety until it finally stuck for 43 days. 

I then relapsed. Even before 22nd January I would have openly admitted to being an alcoholic. But the sobriety made me realise I had no idea what an alcoholic was. I just knew I was one. I learnt a lot about what the word alcoholic means when I stopped consuming alcohol. But the scariest thing is that this relapse has taught me even more. Whereas previously I thought I was an alcoholic because I am socially anxious, had a bad childhood, my dad died suddenly etc - those are all valid reasons but I’m an alcoholic because I drink. That’s it - I just drink. I didn’t drink because I had a bad day or anything like that. I didn’t take that first drink with the intention of getting drunk but I have continued to drink. Because I am an alcoholic. And I know that there are things I don’t know yet. That is what the journey is all about.

It’s hard to explain, but when I drink my brain changes. The way I think as a drunk (even outside of the actual drinking) is different. It’s designed to enable my drinking. In the lead up to 22nd January I simplified things and that was why I didn’t drink on that day. So I’m going to remind myself of a few things that have been lost for a while now:

- the saying (along the lines of) first I had a drink, then the drink had a drink and then the drink had me. These are the truest words I will ever read. Its as simple as this. I read on here multiple times that saying no to the first drink is the most important thing. 

- the worst day sober is still better than the best day drunk. This is even truer after my relapse. I literally drink for no reason. And then I keep on drinking. I don’t have anything bad happen, no triggers, literally no nothing. I just drink for nothing. 

- I’ve done this for too long. Even before I drank everyday I was an alcoholic. It will take very long to reverse this. I may never reverse this but I don’t want to die a drunk. I want to die a dry alcoholic. And between that day and today I want to make an effort everyday for sobriety. 

- I’m doing this for me only. This isn’t a selfless act. I can’t do this for anyone else. Just for me.

I’ve posted here before and then continued drinking. It’s because I couldn’t stop. But I’m still going to post for accountability even if i don’t win today because I need to keep trying and hoping that I can reverse this relapse.",22,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43737444}"

Had a friend pass away and tried to resist drinking, but caved in after only two days. Two months this bender lasted and it was bad. Real bad. I think. I don’t remember... 

But seriously, it got to a point I would drink then immediately throw it up. Thought about getting weed to help keep the booze down. Lost so much weight because I had about 2000 food calories in about two weeks. Whenever I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror and said to myself: “hey ugly”. Was all bloated and just blech.

Look better and feel better now after half a week of not drinking. Have been eating well and put the weight back on. Hydrating well. Get my first Covid vaccine shot tomorrow. 

What I’ve learned from this relapse is that although I was strong before, have to remain strong through and through, even the passing of someone close, and not drink no matter the situation.

Had a first test today. It was a super terrible day and it was all on an emotional, personal level. It was tough. Then to make it worse twisted and injured my calf muscle, so physical level too. That twisting happened at the end of the day, so it capped a shitastic day.

Today I had an appointment for a consultation in relation for a surgery I've wanted for a long time. Unfortunately, my 8am appointment was cancelled without my knowledge due to the clinic not taking my insurance. A bummer. After some doctor hunting I was still unsuccessful and decided to revisit the matter another time. 

When I got home, I was confronted with an issue related to family member that I'm sick of complaining about. I had to deal with it even though I shouldn't. 

Then my friend gushed over how she's thinking about having a kid with her bf next year (not wise), but that led me to feeling all kinds of insecurities. I've been single for many years now and its been a massive struggle (and a massive reason for my drinking), but in this run of sobriety I'm AVOIDING the ""I will always be single"" self pity train. Little reminders of how I'm improving, how I'm not ready for something serious, and how I cannot compare myself to what I see of other people's lives has been super helpful!!

\*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I have neuropathy in my feet and now shooting nerve pain and numbness in my fingers as well. I'll be 39 next month and have been drinking heavily off and on since I was 25. Recently it has gotten very bad. Last week I drank a fifth of vodka and a 12 pack of beer in one day. Tomorrow I'm just going to stop. I'm spiraling out of control. I just hope I can get better. I have kidney and liver issues as well. Liver and kidney problems just sort of sneak up on you all at once which sucks. Looking forward to reading everyone's stories and contributions on the subreddit. Cheers to not drinking.

2021-04-24 00:13:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mxcekl/saturday_share/,Saturday Share...," Over the past two years I've had plenty of time to look back on my life of drinking.  I remember being in elementary school, sneaking drinks with a friend from his parent's liquor cabinet.  I remember getting drunk for the first time when I was in 7th grade, and getting caught by my parents.  I also remember my parents getting a keg of beer for my high school graduation party.  I was already forming a bad relationship with alcohol, but my real drinking habits were formed when I went into the Army, right after High School.  Drinking to get drunk was our sole mission every weekend!  We all had to stock up for the weekend drinking.  I got married, my wife had a baby, I came off active duty, went to college and tech school, had another child, had a challenging and rewarding career, and tried to hold dreams together. Looking back on my life, now sober and fourty years later, I can see things that I couldn't see before.  In the case of drinking alcohol, it's not just a cliché, that Hindsight is 20-20.  The longer I'm away from alcohol, the more clear my vision of myself becomes.  Yes, I had many successes and good points in my life, because life goes on regardless of my drinking, but I also believe that those good points were marred, dulled or alternate versions of what could have been, due to my drinking.  I was a pretty functional drunk, except when I wasn't.  I can see myself better now, because I am no longer deluding or self-sabotaging myself.  My self as an Alcoholic become a really good bull-shitter about how life could still be for me.  I often saw myself as the younger version of myself, when I could still run, bike, swim, play chess, speak foreign languages. 	On June 18th, 2019 I quit drinking permanently. I can say that confidently for the same reasons I will never smoke cigarettes again.  I don't want or need to smoke or drink anymore.  Leading up to my big liberation day from alcohol, I was in pretty rough shape.  I knew a lot of things were “Off” in my life, but couldn't pinpoint it at the time because of the way my brain was functioning. I had just quit my Supervisor position at work, which caused me a lot of stress and loss of sleep.  My emotions were way out of whack and I was escaping with alcohol every night.  I was experiencing severe depression and frequent thoughts of worthlessness and suicide.  I was experiencing a loss of hope and dreams.  I was also scared by a severe memory-loss problem.  I couldn't remember people's names, I couldn't remember a few items that I needed to get at the store, and I couldn't remember things that I should have known.  The realization hit me that I used to be fluent in German, and could hardly speak it now.  I used to beat my computer chess program regularly, and now couldn't win a game with anyone, except a complete novice.  I couldn't remember dates I needed to remember.  Even with that I still didn't quit drinking until I had a near-death experience.  I was finishing up a week-long school and was feeling really tired and weak.  I had been having chest pains for a couple of days, and falling asleep in my classes.  When I was driving home, my chest hurt so badly that I had to stop at a gas station and try to ease the pain.  I thought it was indigestion and gas buildup.  But it was my heart.   It was interesting, because even though I had been repeatedly saying that I wanted to die, when that moment seemed close I wasn't ready, I felt sad.  I thought, but I haven't done this or that, or I had not lived up to my potential.  I wanted to live a little longer.    I wanted to quit alcohol, because I found out it was behind many of my ailments.  I could hardly walk a quarter mile without becoming winded.  My lungs felt terrible, my strength was gone, I was pretty much self-destructing. So, in the same fashion that I quit smoking years before, I quit cold turkey.  It was really hard, but I told myself that It was the same thing, and I've done this before.  Both cigarettes and alcohol are poisons that I willfully put into my body.    I did a lot of reading online to see how others quit and what they did to be successful at it.  I discovered Reddit and this forum early on and really appreciated the stories, both heart-wrenching and successful.  About six weeks into sobriety I had a particularly bad stretch, and posted something here.  Everyone was really supportive and helpful.  I did not drink.  I read Annie Grace's book, and the one by Alan Carr.  I researched the facts they listed about alcohol and found some startling conclusions, including what alcohol really does to our bodies and minds, even in modest amounts.  We all tell ourselves we can handle alcohol, but our bodies don't need it or want it.  Our bodies are resiliant and amazing at trying to cope and adapt in spite of what we put in it.  I knew that there was physical addiction, which should only last for a few weeks, but the emotional addiction could go on forever.  Two of the main reasons I think I was successful are that I started to see alcohol as a poison, and that quitting drinking was both a physical and a psychological problem. Therefore to beat this, I had to deal with both. For psychological reasons, I knew that to succeed, I could never defend alcohol in any way.  That thought helped me overcome feelings of nostalgia for alcohol.    When I first quit, what I wanted to know, and what I kept searching for, was how great life was after quitting drinking.  I kept reading about successes and the benefits others were seeing, and sometimes affirming what I have been experiencing.  I had to confront many issues in my life, like my physical and mental-health problems.  I started walking daily, first just 1/8th of a mile at a time, just to do it daily.  I gradually started feeling stronger and stronger.  Then I took up hiking, which gave me exercise, more variety, adventure in life, exposure to nature, fresh air and sunshine! In my first year of sobriety, my suicidal thoughts disappeared.  I had more hope in life.  I began doing more artwork and learning again.  To help my brain recovery I started learning languages again.  My memory started improving.  I now have a good track record of about a year of studying five languages daily.  It's a pretty good habit to have, If I have to have a habit. Lol.  I'm physically in much better shape and go for three hour hikes with no problem.  My depression lingered, and I still sometimes have bouts of low-self worth, but I'm feeling better, thanks to all of the above.    Also, a year after I quit drinking, I had the courage to find another job.  I studied and passed my Commercial Driver's License and became a Schoolbus Driver!  It is something that I'm pretty sure I could not have done, had I been still drinking.  It turns out I'm a good driver and I like interacting with the kids.  And because I no longer drink alcohol, I never have to worry about losing my license and job due to driving while intoxicated!  That's a good feeling. Early on when I was working on the root causes of my alcohol abuse, I read a good book called, The Depression Cure by Stephen S. Ilardi, which not only helped me with my depression, but also with quitting alcohol.  The holistic approach has helped me tremendously. In the book, he describes six things we need, which are adequate sleep, good nutrition, exercise, sunshine, social connections, and don't think but do.  I still try to do all of these daily, and my motto in recovery became “To give myself a fighting chance,” which we all deserve.",104,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43619874}"

I work in an office during the week and bartend on weekends, and part of bartending (at least in the places I've worked) is shift drinks. That can be anything from pre-shift shots to post-shift beers and everything in between, and you're allowed to work as fucked up as you can handle. When you're a seasoned alcoholic, you can handle a lot. I regularly had 1 or 2 drinks before a shift, 8-10 drinks on shift, and another 4 or 5 afterwards. I worked tonight sober, and I wasn't even tempted: I watched the people drinking and having a great time, knowing what it would devolve into a few hours, how they would feel tomorrow, and that I'd see them back on the same barstools tomorrow night.

I felt really sad for my customers, and it was....odd. I love where I work, but I may step back from the bar and wait tables. I just feel - not okay - about getting the same folks drunk every night. Through clear eyes, I think some of my people have real problems with alcohol, and I felt really wrong slinging drinks all night.

Any sober bartenders out there? Thoughts? I've been doing this for 15 years and I love it (and I make $700-$1,000/week for 2 shifts) but now that I'm sober, I feel like I have a different perspective, and I may need to tap out.

Drank heavily all weekend. Friday night, all day Saturday, all day Sunday. Not pretty. Where I used to be able to just suffer through Monday and be back to normal Tuesday, now that isn't the case. Now I start taking pulls Monday evening, because I know I'll need it to sleep. Did I really need 5 shots of fireball? No, probably not. But I didn't feel the first couple, and I wasn't going to sleep if I didn't feel it.

Big surprise, I'm now hungover Tuesday, too. I know I have to take it easy. But I also know that with the amount I drank Monday, I have to have at least something if I'm going to get any sleep. So I have a couple beers. Just a couple. And I'm still getting little zaps of adrenaline every time I start to drift off. Ok, one shot. 

Wednesday, I finally commit to not drinking. Have trouble sleeping, but I suffer through it and get a shit night's sleep. Thursday I'm tired, but I finally get a good nights sleep. And now, Friday, I finally feel normal. Even though my whole week was basically shit due to my weekend binge, I still feel like it wouldn't be terrible if I caught a small buzz. But I won't, not tonight at least. Hopefully not this weekend, at all. I hope to live up to my full potential next week, and not to forget the affects of a weekend binge.

My girlfriend left me in January which lit a fire under my ass and got me to be motivated to put down the bottle. I quit at first for her. I wanted to better my life in every way so I could win her back. After a month or so we had a final conversation and it made me realize I will never be with her again and its been very depressing ever since...

I met her at work and we still work with each other so I decided to transfer to another hospital to work. Started seeing a psychiatrist who put me on a high dose of antidepressants.

Accidentally taking a big swig of a drink (hey, that's not my juice)
Having drinking dreams

I'm just absolutely not interested in fucking up my life and health anymore, nor trying to hit a new bottom.

If anyone is struggling, I absolutely don't mean to make light of it; the struggle is very real (took me years to figure out how to quit), I'm just wondering if others are the same way?

I'm sure some will warn me that I'm playing with fire and to stay away from it, and perhaps they're right, but it's not like having a drink doesn't cross my mind. It does, nearly every day. I just instantly remind myself where that leads. I'm incapable of moderation.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75823236}"

Holy crap, it’s been a crazy week!

My ex has picked up my daughter for the weekend.  The ex has lost her damn mind, per usual, but this time she’s stepped it up a few notches.  

She’s trying to extort me and blackmail me.  She was watching our daughter while I work, overnight, and decided that I was going to give her $10,000 or she wasn’t going to watch our daughter anymore.  She also notified me that she is going to go after my professional license if I don’t pay her.

I really don’t want her at her mom’s right now, but I’m not allowed to legally prevent her from taking her.  I didn’t think that she’d actually find someone to give her a ride to come get her.

I usually work on Friday nights, but I’m on as leave of absence because all of this.  I’m currently in the process of applying for fmla, because exes drug addict cousin has been using her place as a crash pad and I can’t be having that.  

The ex and daughter are going to be staying at her friends house for the weekend.  At least that’s the story I got.

Anyways, I don’t think I’m going to be doing much besides eating some ice cream and trying to process this mess.  Hopefully, I’ll be able to get some sleep because my sleep schedule is all jacked up from trying to transition from being up all night to sleeping at night.

2021-04-23 20:00:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mx8ef5/hard_truths/,Hard Truths,"Day 5. Last night I had a conversation with the only friend I have who has chosen to be sober after doing every drug and drink under the sun. It was a great convo, she had no judgment and was extremely supportive. The hard part was her telling me “you may be able to drink again, but right now from what you’re telling me, you absolutely cannot moderate right now”

This is hard bc when I started this 30 day challenge, I already had plans with my bf for his birthday and I knew we’d be drinking. I figured I could start my 30 days after his bday, or I could get a head start and accept the 3-4 days we’d be drinking. So I chose to just start, I didn’t want to wait another day. And Honestly I just don’t see myself not drinking for for those days. I 100% plan on continuing the sobriety (in my head I’ll start another 30 days, and might have a day or two I can drink. Idk yet) but Everything he’s planning revolves around alcohol, including a booze cruise. We’re going to have a more in depth conversation tomorrow about how I want to be sober at least 90% of the time (I know this sub isn’t big on moderating but this is what I’m starting with). I already told him I wouldn’t be drinking much, probably 1-2 drinks per day for this trip. I feel confident I can do that.

But my friend has been sober for 2 years and is REALLY encouraging me to be sober for this, and even said I should ask him if he’ll be sober with me too. For some reason that doesn’t feel fair to ask on his birthday..? Like if it were any other event I’d feel more comfortable asking him but this is about HIM. He planned it all and is really looking forward to everything. So if I asked, If I were him I’d feel like.. let down? Especially cause part of our trip is a “makeup” trip since he was gonna go to EDC but it got moved to Oct. I know he wants to party, so even though he’s super supportive in many ways, I’m sure he’d be disappointed to not drink at all. Idk. I don’t want him to feel like he can’t have fun because I have to be careful :/

Sorry I’m just rambling at this point and I guess I’ll have a better idea once we can sit down and talk about it in person tomorrow, but I just feel so conflicted between all the different perspectives. I feel confident about what I want to do, but still keep waffling. Any and all opinions/insight/whatever welcome. I have two weeks to figure it out so I need to just chill a bit.

I am a female in my 20’s who drank for 8 years as a poor means to cope after being drugged and raped by a coworker whom I trusted. I had no support from my parents after it happened, both drinkers who blamed me for the assault. I turned to booze for comfort. Over those years, I would have short periods of sobriety, but always fell off the wagon until I became too addicted to stop without withdrawal. It wasn’t until last year around the time that lockdown was in full effect that it all caught up with me.

I was taking ADHD medication prescribed to me and drinking about 1/3-1/2 of a bottle of vodka every night. The effects were extremely dehydrating and I began to have pains that I assumed were from kidney stones, as the pain was similar. I tried treating myself as if I had kidney stones for a week or so. I stopped being able to go to work due to the pain and lost my job. I was urinating blood and vomiting every time I tried to eat. I wasn’t processing food. I had the worst panic attacks of my life.

It got so bad that I finally went to the ER. They took my blood and when there was a shift change the doctor tossed my results at me and said I was fine, not discussing them. I took those results to my GP who told me that my liver levels were very bad and I needed to admit myself to detox because I was reaching a critical state.

I detoxed inpatient for over a week; slowly, I was able to eat and go to the bathroom normally. After all of that, I was basically scared straight. There were moments of extreme temptation and struggle, but I managed to make it a year. I was proud.

Then I got the first stage of the Covid vaccine on April 4th.

My partner and I both experienced extreme fatigue but I couldn’t even get out of bed and my lower back and area near my liver hurt a little again. I thought it would go away, but the pains remain. Not as bad as when it was at its worst a year ago, but definitely noticeable. I went and had my labs done for my psych office to determine what medications would be acceptable after trying to resume ADHD meds proved to irritate my liver again. My lower back has hurt so bad since that vaccine that I can’t even bend over to pull my skirts up and my fiancé has to help me.

I went online to see the results after the pain got a little worse. My AST and sodium are both one point above being in the red. Both linked to kidneys and the liver.

I started crying when I saw, wondering if I’m not going to live a long life with my love. Wondering if I’ll never get to finish school and follow creative pursuits, explore the world. All because I emulated my parents and coped poorly.

I have a doctor’s appointment next week and I’m scared of what they’ll say. I’ve looked up liver damage and apparently it’s irreversible. Kidney damage looks even more grim upon searches. I’m not even in my 30s yet and wondering how long I might have.

I was so excited and proud to make it a year. Now I’m just terrified.

Does anyone know people who have survived something like this?

My father was an alcoholic, and all of my friends had begun drinking, but I felt that I couldn't because of my dad's problems with alcohol. Being 15, this felt incredibly unfair to me. So I devised a plan to treat drinking like an experiment. I grabbed a bottle of lemoncello from the fridge (I thought it was wine-- it's a liqueur, so much higher in alcohol content), grabbed a journal and began. There are about 2 pages of my increasingly sloppy handwriting detailing how I felt, what I was thinking, etc. It's a little funny reading it now, as a 24 year old, confronting the endless self importance & hubris of my 15 year old self. 

I've been thinking about sobriety a lot, and my very fucked up relationship with alcohol, so I pulled out this journal today and read this entry. And then I kept reading. I had this journal from age 15 to 18. During this time, I started drinking and using drugs. I began to self harm, and my various eating disorders began to consume my life. Page after page is 15, 16, 17 year old me, hating herself. Feeling so unloved and unvalued. Returning again and again to alcohol, drugs, sex, anything that made me feel temporarily safe and loved. 

Reading this now, at age 24, I felt a profound anger and sadness on behalf of my teenage self. I cried-- the ~lock the bathroom door and curl into a ball gasping for breath~ kind of cry. I wanted so badly to give my younger self a hug. She needed a god damn hug. She needed someone to hold her, and tell her she was loved. That she deserved help, and kindness, and grace. 

I've been in pain for so long. So, so long. And that just like that young girl, I deserve help, and kindness, and grace, and to be loved unconditionally. 

If you are reading this, I don't know you, and I don't know what kind of fucked up things you've done, but I know that you deserve those things too, and I hope you're able to seek them out. 

I will not drink with you today.

I found tons of posts these past few months online (many of them were on Reddit), so many posts of people saying “upper right pain, is it my liver??” Etc. I was trying to reassure myself (like many others before me) that it was NOT my liver, so that I could keep drinking. Well I finally went to the doctor and found out through an ultrasound that yes, it’s my liver. I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease (fatty liver disease turns into cirrhosis aka end stage liver disease, so if you have fatty liver and don’t stop drinking, it WILL turn into cirrhosis). Today is day one of my sobriety. I need to stop now, finally.

My ex boyfriend and I have broken up and while it's been heartbreaking I want to spend the time apart to hopefully understand more about the things he struggled with in life, one of which is high alcohol consumption. 

He is a high functioning alcoholic.  I've never mentioned alcoholism to his face as it's not my place to judge his relationship with alcohol but it always concerned me. He has never described himself as an alcoholic, however all of his behaviors point in that direction. He had mentioned how his brother is an alcoholic and he doesn't want to end up like his brother but I see their behaviors as very similar. My family and I have discussed how much he drank and we all care for him and want to help. I personally hardly drink and came from a family that didn't drink either, his family is the opposite. 

Him and I had 2 major discussions over the past 6 months about how I notice his alcohol dependency and how he may be using it as an unhealthy coping mechanism for depression and emotions. He agreed with me. The discussions were very civil and we never exchanged harsh words but it was the first major life talk we had together as a couple and it was hard. 

Long story short, I want to hear from others that have realized that they have alcohol dependency and are high functioning and how it makes you feel or why you turned to substances? How do you navigate relationships and how have your partners been supportive of you? No judgement here, I enjoy learning about other people and understanding the hardships we all go through as humans. I know I'm not perfect.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4960584}"

I had replied to a post with the below in another, ""non-drinking"" sub and figured I had outdone myself so I would share it here. For reference, I am in my late 20's. 

I personally try to avoid situations where drinking is the main attraction, but typically you'll find if you want to maintain your old social circle then you'll find eventually you'll encounter this eventually. I find when I am in this placed in a situation where everyone is drinking and that is the main attraction and activity, there are 3 rules of thumb I follow. Some of this may sound a little machiavellian, but whatever.

**Maintain exclusivity-** What I mean by this is, you can actually leverage your social situation while remaining sober. Control your availability and what I mean by this is pick and choose your battles. If you know your social circle is going to invite you when they go out drink, go half, If not a third of the time. Tell them you're busy with this, that or whatever. (Probably try to actually be busy) By doing this, you're avoiding temptation before it even happens PLUS, when you do actually decide to cave in and go. You'll be excitedly welcomed with open arms because now you've created an exclusivity with yourself. Not always being available will make your presence wanted more.

**Upon arrival, ALWAYS grab a drink for yourself-** When you get to where you are all hanging out, unless its a small setting. Don't say hi but rather bee-line for the bar, cooler whatever and grab yourself a non alcoholic beer or mocktail. If it's a NA beer, pour it in a pint or cup. No one should bother you if you have a drink in hand. Honestly, the drunker people get around you the less they will realize you aren't getting drunk. You'll be on the same ""vibe"" as them in their eyes. Play the part! Laugh, be silly, bullshit with everyone! Let yourself act a little goofy and cut loose. No one cares! If they offer to buy you a drink decline, always grab your own drink unless they know you don't drink. Which leads me to my third rule.

**When people begin to become visibly drunk, it's time to circle back to rule #1. Maintain exclusivity (Bonus points for an Irish Goodbye)-** Let's be real, we all know this point in the evening. Everyone is beginning to repeat themselves and get loud. The drunken sloppiness is being shown via a loss of motor skills. The conversations begin to lose substance and your peers are becoming either a little too honest, too aggressive or too friendly. No sober person enjoys this. If you tell me you do, you're lying. It's time boogey.

This is where you pull the ""Irish Goodbye"". You seize a moment where everyone drinking is bullshitting with each other and you disappear. No warning to anyone and if you must, a hint you may leave. Chances are, if everyone is really boozing. No one will immediately notice.

\#1 This allows you to exit the situation without any protests. When and if they do notice you're gone, You're gone. ""Sorry, had to jet! lol""

\#2 You're being a good sport. By not announcing your end to your night, The party still lives on! Once you announce you're leaving, it kinda puts a damper because everyone starts to think about the end of their night. Let them carry on! You become the person who keeps the party going, sans interruptions, by sneaking out. You're never stuck with an awkward half-hug, or a straggler that wants to come with you, or second thoughts that give in to FOMO-induced fears. You develop a reputation, a persona and aura as an Irish exit-er. People expect it. And even admire you for it. It's just a little nuance of character that becomes part of your personality.\*\*

\*\*obviously, if it's a small gathering (less than 6 people) you don't do this but anything more..

\*POOF SMOKE PELLET\*

So far, this strategy has gone well for me. I haven't drank but have been able to maintain and navigate these kinds of social situations. You'll be invited next time they go out!",29,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5400787}"

So I’ve been trying to get back to L.A. as I had to move back home recently due to losing my job because of COVID. I recently had a job interview which went REALLY well. So much that they pretty much offered me the job on the spot. I filled out all the paperwork and took a drug test.


So I pretty much had the job pending a drug test and background check-both of which I know I passed. I’m a pretty impatient person and decided to call HR yesterday to see if there had been any further developments as I was looking to fill out an application for an apartment once the job was confirmed. I was told that the position has already been filled but they were considering me for another position. I’ve never been so close to having a job only to be told said job is no longer available. I’m still baffled as I was told by my interviewer multiple times how good of a job I did in my interview, what my wage would be, and that the next time I’d see her would be my first day of work. I don’t understand why this process went so far just to be told the positions been filled. 

I can understand if this were on me and I failed my background check or drug test but I didn’t. Like what?! 

Driving back home in the car after the interview was the happiest I’ve been in a loooong time. Felt like I was finally going to have a life again. Not one that consisted of living on a relatives couch while on unemployment feeling like an absolute failure. 

Needless to say finding out this news has been the shittiest thing I’ve heard in a while. Im so tired of being stuck. Doing everything I’m supposed to and have it amount to nothing. Although I personally know things will eventually get better, it’s frustrating not knowing when that will be.

I ended up emailing my interviewer as I was hoping to get some clarity from her. Unfortunately the email remains unanswered and I’m still in the dark as it seems anyone that can help me out is gone for the weekend. HOWEVER the plus side to all of this is I never once considered drinking yesterday AND I can wake up this morning feeling no shame knowing the email I sent my interviewer was a pleasant one. Not sure the same can be said had I been drinking.

2021-04-23 16:19:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mx45oo/trapped_between_depression_and_alcoholism/,Trapped Between Depression and Alcoholism,"This is the first time I've posted on Reddit. I often check into some of these Quit Drinking groups but have remained silent until now. I don't know what will come of this post, but I thought it would be therapeutic to write about my story. 

First, I am an alcoholic. I have been for over 20 years. I feel so completely trapped by it. Sobriety seems impossible. And here's why. 

I started drinking daily when I was about 22. I was (and still am) a chronic insomniac. This may be hard to believe but insomnia has been more detrimental to my life, in part because after trying everything and I mean everything to sleep (pills, meditation, exercise, yoga, natural remedies) I finally turned to alcohol. Yes, I was often tired and hungover, but it was better than total sleep deprivation (which almost killed me on more than one occasion). My insomnia has been so bad, there have been times I've been without a wink of sleep for days. I also suffer from severe, chronic depression, which runs in my family (my cousin, uncle and grandmother all took their lives).

So began my journey as an alcoholic. 

In the last nearly 25 years of drinking, I have been to detox and rehab twice. The last time was just before the pandemic. I relapsed 3 months later.

Unlike those that get sober and experience a new found love for life - being more clear-headed, stronger, more focused, being a better husband, father, etc, etc. Both times I stayed sober for a good stretch of time, I have fallen into the deepest darkest depression I have ever experienced. Strong suicidal thoughts. I've adjusted my meds too many times to try and find the right combination. The anti-depressants have never really worked well for me.  Therapists have never worked. I've seen many. But when I start drinking again, as much as I hate myself, the depression lessens and while I'm drinking the depression vanishes. I start writing music again, I engage more with my family (albeit while buzzed), I escape my depression and anxiety for a few hours, rather than live with it all day and night. 

I really thought the last time I sobered up, it would be different. But it was worse. And the longer I was sober the worse it got.

And now, my drinking is even worse than it was before I went to rehab (granted, I also had a total mental breakdown which was really what led to a full intervention and ultimately rehab).

I know I'm killing myself (killing myself to live for you Sabbath fans). While my wife knows I'm back to drinking, she thinks it's a couple beers a night. No one knows how bad it is. I continue to get up early, work all day (I continue to have a successful career). I'm even running a half marathon next month (which would be a hell of a lot easier to train for if I was sober). So anyone that knows I went to rehab still thinks I'm more or less clean.

It's all a horrible shitshow of lies and self-destruction, but as insane as it is the alternative led me down another dark path of extreme depression and suicidal ideation. I was truly worse to be around post-rehab than after my relapse. I didn't talk. A secretly cried everyday. I truly hated life. So back to the bottle I went.

I think I've rambled on long enough for now. Not expecting answers.  Just needed to do something and I thought posting my story here would be cathartic if nothing else. Though I would be curious if anyone else here suffered brutal depression after sobering up.",12,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7548699}"

First off let me say that I was a moderate but regular (daily) drinker for about 30 years. I quit about a dozen times over the years, usually for a week or two. This is the first time I have gone 50 days. During the other AF periods, I was quick to appreciate the mornings, waking up without having drunk the night before. But the evenings were always kind of a challenge. I would get distracted by the missing alcohol. Well, just recently, for the past few nights, as I have been going through the routine getting ready for bed, I have noticed little differences. On the one hand you could say it is nice to have a full sense of balance, to not be bumping in to things. But that's not exactly it, I wasn't getting staggering drunk in my drinking days and I still bump into things from time to time sober. It's more just the subtle differences between the sober mind and the semi-buzzed mind. Like I said, quitting alcohol one is quick to notice this in the mornings. I feel like now noticing it in the evenings as well is a good milestone for me. Just wanted to put this out there for anyone else starting out on an AF life or just taking a break for a while.

I ended up with my mum (a nurse) who was able to assist me when I had grand malignant seizures which others said I was not having.

Was offered support from friends and community a few times (I cannot recall) though seizures where so dangerous and long lasting, having them anywhere other than hospital or house made me vulnerable to others and damage.

When you start out, not drinking seems monumental. It’ll seem like a ‘normal’ life is simply impossible without drinking. You’ll wonder if you can do it, if it’s worth it, what you’ll gain by going through all the hard, hard work. 

These aren’t empty promises - It’s possible, you’ll gain more than you can imagine, more than I could ever describe in a simple post, and it is absolutely worth it. 

Every old timer on here will tell you that life is better and not drinking becomes completely normal and, really, no big deal. Once you get over the hump and have all your sober ways established, you barely even think about it anymore - other than to be grateful that you no longer drink. You’ll be free.

Although the long road to happy sobriety is really, quite complicated and a lot of hard work, the key (if I could give any advice to someone starting out) is to just break it down in to little steps. Don’t drink this minute, this hour, this day. Don’t take that first drink. And just keep doing that over and over and over. Sometimes it’s a simple and complicated as that - don’t drink today. And see what happens. Repeat again tomorrow. 

I wish you all love and happiness and strength. You can do it and it will be worth it!

But I'm still counting.

I quit cold turkey on Feb 22 after decades of daily abuse. Near the end, it was all Vodka. The cheapest stuff at the big box liquor store and bought frequently enough the cashiers knew me and my schedule.

I had no idea what I was in for. I'd never tried to quit before and never knew the extent of my physical and mental dependence. I face-tanked 3 days of intense symptoms. Shaking, my whole body clenching up, my brain convinced it was dying and in a state of panic.

I tried to keep my wife from finding out, but it was too much. I had to disclose all the secrets of my addiction and admit not only had I been lying, I was severely addicted.  She's been very supportive and I should have done that from the start.

What followed has been a daily battle that is slowly beginning to get easier. I never had a ""pink cloud"", instead I discovered the damage to mental health from years of addiction had left it's mark.

For the next month, I rode a daily roller coaster of anxiety, tension, irritability and a never before experienced feeling that I needed to crawl out of my skin. Focusing on daily tasks was impossible during the dips, and the highs were generally just feeling numb.

Things HAVE gotten better though. The lows aren't as low anymore. They're more manageable and pass quicker.  I have moments where I feel relaxed and content also. They aren't much, but they're the first ones I've had that didn't involve alcohol since my early 20's.

It's been a hard slog. Anyone considering quitting after years of abuse should understand that this is a LONG process, one that doesn't resolve itself in a few days. You need to keep that in your mind like a mantra. There are no instant cures. There is no quick resolution.

You are an exhausted hiker who now has to turn around and find your way back... or collapse on the trail and give up.

Don't give up. Keep putting one foot in front of the other until you start recognizing where you were when you started. It's worth it.

So it's kind of always happen but it's gotten far more frequent over the past two or three years. Let's say I'm in the shower and I hear the water running. I'll start to hear music in it and what not. Same with most any white noise. Like I'll actually start making out words and stuff too. Sometimes it's something I recognize hearing on the radio, sometimes not. Things like my air conditioner running, cars driving by, they do the same thing. Sometimes I'll mistake noises like that for someone saying my name or something as well. It's really odd. 

I've read about delusions and alcohol and wonder if it could be related. I'm a bit scared because Ive also read these are symptoms of schizophrenia which runs in my family. In fact my little cousin was recently diagnosed with it.

Today I am officially 3 days sober, and I have no one to tell!","Hi everyone! I came to terms that I had an alcohol addiction last year, and this year I started noticing the way my health was declining after 6 years heavy drinking. I am very good at hiding my addiction from friends and family. The only one who knew is my boyfriend, but he is in denial of how much I drink.  A lot of them think that I just enjoy socially drinking, but no one knew how much alcohol I would hide in secret. No one knew that I was already drinking before each gathering, at the start of everyday. Drunk through work meetings, drunk through family events, hanging out with friends, going to dinner, drunk alone at home, or with everyone at home... I always had a way of sneaking alcohol with me. To others I am seemingly pretty well put together and responsible. But to myself, I am sloppy, make mistakes I can’t remember, never at my full potential, lost time and memories.... all because of alcohol. 

This week I decided that it was time again. And this isn’t my first attempt of quitting, I have NEVER made it past day 2. I dumped out all of the remaining drinks in the house and decided to go all in, and for the first time in 6 years, I am 3 days sober!!!! I know, it’s not a lot. But I have to be proud of myself. Yesterday was such a stressful trying day and I almost gave in, but I didn’t. 

Now that I have a little clarity,  it makes me disappointed to think about how much of my life I can’t remember or appreciate because of addiction. Yesterday I had my first big laugh without being drunk, and it was the first in a while I felt a genuine happy emotion as my true self.

Fell in love with drinking in college

A 6 pack for the weekend turned into a bottle of hard liquor for the weekend at some point in my 20s

Solo drinking. At the beginning I would restrain from drinking alone, but over time I became completely OK with this, as well as sitting at bars by myself. It felt like I was socializing and watching the game, but really I just wanted to drink.

Sneaky drinking. I would regularly stop at the liquor store on the way home from work, pound a few nips in my car, come home to my wife and crack a beer as though it was my first drink.


It made me feel better. It made me sociable. I loved grilling with a beer in hand. It just made things better, so I thought for many years.

What made me finally quit?

* Grieving over my father who died from complications with alcohol in 2016
* Reading ""quit lit"" (lots of good book recommendations on this sub)
* Supportive family and a wife who also chose to stop drinking
* Sick of my low self esteem
* Sick of disappointing my family
* Sick of gaining weight
* Sick of not being able to ""control"" my intake
* Sick of the reasoning and excuses to continue drinking on a daily basis

I still have a lot to work on. It's really hard to fill the ""hole"" once you stop drinking and not replace it with other unhealthy choices. But I learned that alcohol was providing 0 benefits for me and I was really using it as medicine, to cover up emotions and feelings that I was afraid of. Stopping drinking doesn't fix your underlying problems, but it allows you to start tackling them productively.

I'm also going to work on removing the guilt and struggle associated with not drinking, and try to think of sobriety with enthusiasm. I have a hard time wanting things or being passionate about stuff, so maybe if I make living a sober life a thing I actively want, I'll kill two birds with one stone.

Quitting alcohol was like breaking up with a long time lover.

The first few months I was so thirsty!  I just told myself, well I guess I'm just going to be thirsty ebolaprep until it goes away.  I thought about it every minute of every day.  
It had been such a huge part of my life, and now it was gone.  Thought about sneaking a drink, no one will know...  except me, I would know.  I went to 90 AA meetings in 90 days, every day I went.  
 
Then, I wasn't thirsty all the time, I only thought about it at the end of the day, my normal drinking times.  It was whispering in the back of my head, sweet nothings, the good times, the longing for a time now passed.  But it was easier to push it out of my head or find something to do to distract me.  Mostly go to a meeting when that happened.

Eventually, now, I only crave it when I'm doing a project or it's a sunny day and I'm on the porch.  But I think back at what that bitch took from me, the grieving I went through to break the cycle that had held me for two decades, taken my youth, my time and my money.  I take a sip of ice tea, smile, and go about my day, always on guard that it will sneak up behind me again, but now with some tools to defend myself from future attacks.

I owe my sobriety to God and to the people in those rooms.

They don’t pressure me to drink, but drinking culture has been indoctrinated into our relationship.

Now it's a thing. It's looming. Am I tired enough? Will I _actually_ sleep or will this be one of the 'one hour of sleep' days? Should I take melatonin today? Diphenhydramine? When I inevitably wake up after an hour or two, am I going to be able to get back to sleep? Will the sleep I actually get be riddled with nightmares? Why do I feel like hell when I _do_ get seven hours? The list goes on and on. There's answers to all of these questions, of course; but they don't matter. Not pounding the bottle of bottom shelf 80 proof for today is what ultimately matters.


I know it's still too soon to count on having all the benefits of better sleep. And that the routine of things will probably solidify over time (providing I keep good, consistent sleep hygiene) which will likely make it easier. Pros outweigh cons and all that. Guess I just needed to get this off my chest.

It has been over 200 days since I had my last drink. I snuck it from the cabinet while my partner was in another room and my baby was lying on the mat beside me. I knew I had a very stark choice to make. I knew it would be so painful. It also really felt like my life depended on it. This wasn’t about me anymore and I couldn’t say the only person I was hurting was myself. This baby, he needed me. I had wanted and waited for him my whole life! What was I DOING?!? 
I had not been drinking regularly. I really had not drunk much at all for the 18 months prior to this moment. Not all all during my pregnancy. I thought I could pump my breastmilk and time when I could have drinks.
It was a living nightmare. It was horrendous. Even in my inebriated state; I felt the trap closing in on me again.

So, I took that last sip. That guilt-riddled, not enjoyable, just stop the horror for a moment last sip. I haven’t looked back. 
I have been wildly angry and wildly sad.
I have been full of joy. 
I have regretted and bargained and pleaded with myself.
I have not listened to that bastard voice telling me it will be okay to just have one. 
That has made all the difference.

In 200 days I have gotten a part-time job and am contributing, while bringing up the loveliest and funniest little boy. He’s my best friend.
We also bought our first house and it settled on day 200. There is absolutely no way this would have happened if I was drinking. No way. 
This happened because I was sober.
The end.
I could not be more grateful.
I could not be more scared. 
I can’t lose this life. I love it.

So due to a set of largely unforseen circumstances, I had to spend the night at my parents' house last night. It's a long story, but basically my son has a doctor's appointment today that we really couldn't miss at a hospital an hour away from our house, but 10 minutes from my parents' house. My car is still in the shop (it was supposed to be done weeks ago but the parts needed were on back order.) My husband was planning on working from home so I could take his car, but at the last minute he ended up being told that he would need to come in. Yada Yada Yada, it was deemed that the easiest way to handle the situation was to spend the night at my parents', and borrow their car to take my son to his appointment. 

Fine, except that once we were actually driving to my parents' house, my inner addict went nuts. My parents are drinkers, and my mom drinks the same exact wine that is (was) also my jam. They are (functional) alcoholics too, and even though I had told my dad that I wasn't drinking, I knew that if I breezed in and poured myself a glass of wine, nothing would be said. My inner addict started ""reasoning with"" me, telling me that nothing bad was going to happen if I drank wine with my mom for one night. It's just one night, and you hardly ever get to see her! Wouldn't it be fun to drink wine and laugh with her for one night? What does one night matter? What if, in fact, you make the rule that you don't drink... Except at your parents house? I mean, jeeze, does life have to be so black and white? You're allowed to have a little nuance, like ""I don't drink except for at my parents house."" And on and on and on. It was a spectacularly intense craving. The only way I can describe it is like being pinned by your throat up against a brick wall, where no matter which way you turn, you can't pull or even look away. It felt fucking horrible and I felt ready to give in and go along with that addict reasoning. 

But then something happened. I thought about my counter here, and how proud I am to have almost a month. I even thought about *lying* here, just not resetting my counter. Who would ever know? Well, I would, and it wouldn't feel good to look at that counter any more. It would just be another addict lie. And I thought about my kids' faces (even though they were in the car with me, lol, but I was too effed up inside my own head to even turn and look at them, so I just closed my eyes and thought of their faces) how open and trusting they are, and how much I don't want to ruin that by making them grow up with a mom who is an active addict and a fucking liar. I thought about how I knew that if I drank one glass of wine with my mom tonight, I would get completely hammered, and I would have to get up early and take my son to his appointment hungover. And I realized that my parents' house is a big trigger for me, and I may always struggle with my sobriety there. I thought ""If not now, when? When will you have done enough work and strung together enough days of sobriety that you can actually go to their house and stay sober? You see them like once a month. Are you always going to be like 1 month or less sober? And I asked myself what I really want. Me, not my addiction. I want sobriety.

So I started making a plan, to escape upstairs if I had to. To not let my husband leave without me if I thought I couldn't deal. To announce to my parents in front of my husband and kids that I wasn't drinking and I need them to not even ask or offer. To take an Uber to a hotel room in the dark of night if I had to. Anything. Anything to not drink.

And as soon as I made that decision, the craving started subsiding. I could breathe again at least. By the time I reached my parents' house, I felt strong and ready to say no and to do whatever it took to keep myself on Day 26.

And now the irony. Pretty much the second I walked in, my dad said ""Sorry, we can't offer you anything to drink. Your mom and I aren't drinking right now."" Halle-fucking-luja! It wasn't even a thing! And my parents aren't drinking right now?!? ❤️

But I'm still so glad that I decided not to drink before I knew that. It feels so much better than if I had shown up planning to drink and then just couldn't. It feels like progress.

So I don’t know what I was expecting but this is the second time over the 5 weeks that I’ve talked to her about my sobriety and both times I feel this sort of dismissive and uninterested tone. No “I’m so proud of you” or anything too warm. Hit me with the “it’s a hard thing”, which obviously is true. 

So to add some color and context here, my earliest big trauma in life came from my mother. She became addicted to pharmaceuticals after her back surgery. This would have been between say 2006-2010..? Between the grades of 8th or 9th up through kicking me out of the house after graduation. I wasn’t a delinquent or anything but I did smoke pot and have a smart mount (funny to me). But she obviously couldn’t handle it, I would assume due in part to her own addiction. So the trauma from that whole experience (witnessed multiple ODs, ambulances and fire trucks in driveway, all my friends in high school knew how fucked up she got. I called it “woozy” at the time. Anyway, really long story there but the point is the trauma. I can only begin to unpack how that affected me but i would guess the big result has been my own lack of security/feeling unloved and unwanted. Now fast forward to binging throughout 20s, get married, slow the drinking but I know it’s still a problem. 4 years into the relationship boom, she’s been cheating on me. Devastated. I’m sure I could have been better but I know it’s not my fault that she chose to abandon me. And that separation happens Dec 19, covid shutdown began 3 months later. 

So yeah, had a really bad year last year. Started trying to kick the booze in September, finally got it to stick 33 days ago. I just don’t really have many positive relationships or people to get encouragement from, so I just wanted to come here and spill some of my guts.

My story and advice for those new to sobriety,"As of today I have 761 days, or 110 weeks, or 2 years 1 month and 1 day since I gave up alcohol. I've never posted here before but I've been here for a while. I found this place very early into my journey, and I've been coming here pretty much daily ever since. If your new here here's a solid piece of advice.  This is the place. Your in the right spot! This community has so much to offer. Support, Encouragement, inspiration. Sometimes I just needed to know someone else was on the same day at the same time and feeling the same things as me and they weren't giving up. As someone who's benefited so much from all the posts here over the last 2 years I feel like it's finally time for me to make my contribution to stopdrinking. 

I'd like to start off with a little basic information about myself. Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest I am male, 34 yrs old (quit drinking at 32), 5'8"", 140lbs (165-170 when I was drinking). What was my life before I started drinking? Ill keep it basic. I grew up a Mormon. The last time I went to church I was 18. Happily atheist now (no hard feelings anymore). My parents split when I was young (12ish). It was hard. A few years later we moved from our house to an apartment then my mom got remarried so we moved for the second time in a year. I already wasn't doing well in school so I dropped out at the end of my Jr year in '04. Then as a way to get away from home/religion I ended up joining the Army in Jan '05. I did four years active duty. I deployed to Iraq for 15 months from Jan 07 - march 08. I was An EOD tech in the army. I really enjoyed my time. I got out of the Army and moved to Vancouver, WA in Jan '09 and that's when I started drinking.  What did I drink? I drank beer. I really liked strong IPAs (Boneyard RPM, Bridgeport Hop Czar were my go to) although it was a lot of Budweiser toward the end there. And I drank beer everyday. Every day for about 10 years I drank at least 9 beers; up to 15 on weekdays, and somewhere between 12 and 24 on weekends. 

My normal routine would be that I would grab a couple tall boys on the way home from work, drink that, then go to a gas station or mini mart and get two more tall boys. Take those home and drink them, and then repeat that process until I was too drunk to drive. I would leave the closest places for last because then I'd walk until i was too drunk to physically walk anywhere but my bed. So I'd lay down, pass out, wake up, Puke my guts out in the morning before work and repeat the whole thing over again. Everyday.

Of course over the course of my drinking career I tried to quit multiple times. Although every attempt failed because I thought I was ""good to go"" and could moderate. My first two attempts lasted a couple weeks each. My third try lasted about a month. Then I had a couple goes at it that lasted three and four months respectively.  Other than those couple shots at sobering up you could pick any date between Jan 2009 and march 21st 2019 and I don't even have to guess what I was doing, I was getting shitty that day for sure.  

It was the worst endless cycle ever. Every night laying there wondering why I did it again, and telling myself it had to be the last time. Then spending all day at work thinking of things to do other than drinking so I didn't drink that night. But then on the way home going to 711 or wherever and telling myself ill just grab a couple and that'll be it. I was 32 and still getting completely fucked up every day like I was 21 still. My body was at the point where extreme hangover was the normal. I could barely get through the days anymore. I would feel like shit until I started drinking everyday then feel even shittier after I started drinking. 

Then on Mar 21 2019 I didn't make it through the day. I went home early from work because the pain in my body from drinking was so bad. It was a Thursday and at that point I was drinking probably 15 beers a day on a weekdays. I knew when I went home that day I could never drink again, and that time it couldn't just be talk. I knew for a while it had been coming. I needed to quit. My health was going, I literally felt like maybe death was sooner than further away, and my ability to do my job was being compromised all because of drinking. 

In stopdrinking the question gets asked a lot what did you do differently that made it stick this time? This time I told myself forever. Other times I quit drinking thinking if i quit long enough I could come back and moderate. In reality I cant even moderate for one day. That's just me being real about me.   This time instead of worrying about when it would be okay to drink again I decided to just be sober and go wherever that was going to take me. I didn't worry about trying to learn a new instrument or writing a book or taking up running this time. It was very boring for a long time, the boredom does pass. When does the boredom pass? that gets asked a lot too. Ill be honest and say that it was only very recently, within the last six months, that I suddenly realized life isn't boring anymore. I'm happy to say that now I have a few hobbies (golf and reading) that have naturally come up since Ive sobered up and they consume more time than I have available. Life will get interesting again it will happen it just takes a long time. 

Another thing I did differently this time was to not expect anything within any sort of time frame. I fucked my life with alcohol for 10 years, and I was finally prepared to play the long game this time. I realized if I didn't see any positive results for the next five years even that that's still only half the time I was drinking for. I ended up not having to wait that long. Not drinking was a chore until about six months in then I started seeing a light at the end of the tunnel, and it probably wasn't until somewhere around the one year mark when I finally went a whole day without thinking about beer at all. Those first six months sucked literally just waiting for life to not suck anymore It was the hardest thing I've ever done. but once you can get over the cravings and then missing booze in general from there its all about just seeing where life takes you. I was drunk for the first 10 yrs of my adult life, and at 34, two years into this sobriety journey, everything in life is new to me and my journey is no where near over. Its also way more fun than alcohol ever was. 

Before I end this I want to re give my own version of  the best piece of advice Ive seen on here in the two years Ive been around. How do you stay sober once you start? Don't drink. Don't go to the store. Don't buy just one. Don't drink. If you're thinking about it. Don't drink. Because you cant have two if you don't have one. You cant handle one. I cant handle it. So don't drink. not even a little bit. Don't drink. It may seem like the dumbest piece of advice but in all reality it is the real secret, and the only thing that worked for me. If you really don't want to drink then Do not drink. at all.   


Sorry that was a little long, but I guess that's kind of it.  Good luck to everyone wherever you are in your journey. Congratulations to you for making it to wherever you are on your journey. and remember day 100 is an achievement but day 1 is the hardest. We got this! IWNDWYT!

I've gone without drinking maybe once or twice in the last few months, and probably in the last 7 years gone a consecutive week in total without it. I think I'm at my limit. I don't even know why I decided it, I didn't have a particularly bad night compared to many I've had, but I guess the accumulation of months and months of wanting to die every single morning and all of a sudden I decided I can't do this anymore, I keep thinking about that quote 'get busy living or get busy dying.' I've decided to get busy living.

I already feel happier and more hopeful than I have in a long long time. Not a high kind of happy, I only have that kind of happy when I'm after a shoulder of vodka, but more of a tentative happiness. I woke up today and felt the typical rush of anxiety, then after 30 seconds realised 'wait, I watched a movie with my housemates last night, brushed my teeth, said goodnight and I only feel so groggy because I stayed up watching cooking videos until 4am.' The relief I felt was probably better than the relief I get from the first drink of the day.

Yesterday I wanted to go buy drink so so badly, but I went for a walk with my housemate/best friend until 10pm, where I live they don't sell alcohol after that and obviously no pubs are open right now. I haven't told her yet that I'm stopping but she definitely disapproves of my drinking so I try not to buy in front of her. But when we got home our other housemate offered us wine. I said 'no thank you' and watched whole movie with the wine just there on the counter while they had a glass or two. I'm so so proud I didn't take it, and I have a weird pride that my friend saw me say no to it.

I just feel all of a sudden overpowered by shame and guilt, I know I'm literally just on day 3, but it's like I keep looking hopeful to the future and thinking of who I could be, and then thinking of who I have been makes me feel so much shame at what I've done, so so so much guilt of how my friends and family have been affected by it.

Sorry for the long spiel, this is just the first place I'm admitting I'm quitting. I haven't told anyone else because it feels so slippery - I've tried before and I don't want to face people's disappointment when they see me drunk again. I just think maybe this time's different because even though I've known I have a problem for a long time, I've always been trying to quit for others. But this time I want to quit for me.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is just, where do I go from here? I have so many anxieties coming up, memories of things I've done and people done to me, I don't think I can face many of the situations that I usually face by getting drunk, I feel like I don't have the confidence without drinking. I'm terrified at the possibility of someone literally just handing me a can and I don't think I could say no. Or the 3 off licenses each less than ten minutes away from my house. I've tried AA and felt that wasn't for me, I swear that's not an excuse, it really didn't help me. So what would be good to help stop me from going to the off license this evening, and the evenings after that?",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42617556}"

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

There are so many surprises in early recovery.   
 

We hear about weight loss, boundless energy, amazing sleep - my first month had exactly none of that, but all have improved with time for me. They don’t improve for everyone, but alcohol is certainly not doing anyone any favors in those departments.   
 

Here are some of the unexpected wins from quitting alcohol for just under five months:

My senses, once dulled, are now back in full force. Food tastes better. Candles, tea, and other fragrances are suddenly important to me.   
 

I am overwhelmed at acts of kindness and coincidence I see out in the world and they stay on my mind long after I leave a scene. I saw a rare butterfly - a zebra swallowtail - on a birthday hike and I audibly gasped with joy and amazement. I was alone with a sense of wonder I have not had as an adult.   
 

My hair was so brittle and was breaking and falling out. I had to cut it all off, and that was really the final straw for my decision to quit. If I could feel the damage it was doing to my body externally, lord knows what was going on internally. And of course I was too afraid to go to a doctor, because then they might find out. My nails were so flimsy and chippy, even polish couldn’t keep them from seeming to crumble apart. In less than 5 months, my fresh hair is soft and my nails are hard. The body’s recovery is amazing.   
 

I answer the damn phone. I don’t know when it happened, but I had become petrified of phone calls, sober or not. It was a physical kind of fear when I heard my phone ring. Then I would debate answering it, then if I chose not to, would I lie? Text them and say I was busy? Now I need to make time to call them back, or should I just totally ignore this call completely until I jolt awake at 2 am feeling like a jerk? Now, I just answer.

I felt weird celebrating after 24 hours, I felt weird celebrating after 48, I felt proud of celebrating 72 hours. I was ecstatic When I reached 30 days. But now I've reached 100 days sober, And I don't know how I really feel. I have changed so much in these last 100 days. At the beginning of the day I was just kind of ""well that's just a day, just another day.""

 However as the day went on I thought about all the things that I have changed in my life, all the people that have been inspired (or terrified) by my transformation to do their own sort of transformation in their lives. I was kind of a closet alcoholic. Not too many people even knew I was a drinker. When everyone asks my secret to weight loss, I tell them "" I quit my night job. I'm now semi-retired and I have time for my hobbies and my health. "" If they ask for more info, then I explain my night job was spending exorbitant amounts of money emptying bottles into my belly and eating garbage until I passed out everyday. 

I've always kind of been a hermit. Trapped. Now I'm out there in the world, not totally held down by anxiety, able to go places because I'm not drunk, able to focus on things and enjoy them. Standing up for myself, caring for myself. I've been single for a long time because I knew that if there was anyone out there who liked me that they must be more fucked up than I am or they don't know me well enough to know better. But now I actually kind of like myself for the first time in a very very long time. I'm not too ashamed of myself anymore. I still got a lot of work to do fixing my house, my mind, my body but I'm definitely looking forward to start dating again soon. I'm not sure how that world works anymore... but I don't have crippling anxiety now, just my base level awkward self to deal with.

Getting compliments on my appearance from people is definitely a new thing to me. I don't know how to respond to it except say ""thanks?"" Definitely a lot more outgoing than I used to be. Enjoying exercise very strange. I used to hate even the thought of it. Now when I do it I just don't want to stop sometimes.

Anyways, if you're still reading this and you're still drinking, know that you're not the only one. I lurked here for about six or seven years, occasionally reading posts. Hoping to find an answer or a starting point. I'd read stories of success and stories of failure and fantasize about quitting. 2020 pushed my mind, body, and wallet to the absolute limits. Everything that was bad got worse and everything just kept rolling downhill faster and faster. After thinking that I was having heart attacks I finally took my stubborn ass to a doctor. Did the whole swarm of tests for cardiac related things to find nothing. I was going through withdrawals just hours after I would have my last drink. I got an ultimatum from the doctor, essentially. ""You quit drinking right now and we will help you through this process. Or you can keep drinking and things will keep getting exponentially worse. It took you a month of having the exact symptoms of a heart attack multiple times a day just to make a phone call to visit a doctor. I don't think you'll come back if you keep drinking. You'll end up going somewhere soon but it will probably not be here or your job."" 

So I quit. I'm done. I'm not going back. I've tasted freedom for the first time in years. It took a long time. It's worth it, you are worth it, your friends are worth it, your family's worth it. You just have to be ready, whatever and whenever that is for you.

Languishing is the word someone aptly pointed out to me yesterday after a [recent NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/well/mind/covid-mental-health-languishing.html) captured the feeling. Toronto, Canada is on day 150 of lockdown, with nothing to do, nowhere to go. There's only so many walks I can take with the dog. I turned 30 2 1/2 weeks ago and felt nothing. I reached 9 months of sobriety for the first time in my life a few days ago (after about 1 1/2 years of trying), and it boosted my spirits for a bit, but it's getting tough. I have no cravings, I'm getting to my AA meetings, I speak with my sponsor every day. I'm lucky too - I received my first shot of Pfizer a few days after my birthday and I'm starting to get the sense I have some protection, but it feels like it's useless. Or at least under utilized.

I have done the sober thing on and off for a while, was off while studying for my PhD exams and just haven’t gone back on yet, but have been planning to. She was asking about what affects my sleep, I said a few things including alcohol in that list. She asked a couple questions about frequency/amount, which is usually between none and a couple drinks a day and she just lit into me about how horrible it is (I know, I told her I knew) and why I didn’t want to call my mother (who drinks a lot every night for as long as I can remember) an alcoholic and blah blah blah. I don’t call her an alcoholic because the label creates an image that doesn’t represent her and I think does a disservice to the complexity of the spectrum of alcohol use disorder (how many times have you heard “I drink a lot, but I’m not *an alcoholic*”). I don’t care if someone prefers that label for their situation, I’m just cautious about using it.

Here’s the thing: I don’t mind expressing concern. But I had already told her I planned to quit entirely as my fiancé and I want to start a family soon and I don’t want my kid to grow up seeing their parents drink like I did. I want better for them. But she kept beating me up over the fact that I have been drinking, paying no mind to my statement that I was quitting imminently or offering anything constructive. It destroyed the motivation I had to recommit to sobriety and made me feel like such a failure that I had prioritized dealing with other life stuff over this thing, even though I’m actively aware and getting back to it. Maybe she was having a bad day or couldn’t hear me (lots of background noise on our phone call), but it was so unhelpful and honestly hurtful to feel like my effort, recognition, and plan/excitement for change weren’t good enough.

I don't have enough time in the evening to eat, shower, spend time with my daughter and do something for myself to unwind. On top of it they want us to make time for UAs and another meeting of our choice during the week...neither of which I knew about when signing up. It's making for a grueling, stressful, tiring week, and my house looks like a dump.

For those who are coming across this post from me for the first time - I've been in somewhat a time VS sobriety race with myself. 

I've tried so many times to get sober, just to fail time and time again. So my confidence in myself to actually get sober and stay sober, has been a mental battle. When day 1 began, telling myself that I can actually make it a full year sober (and then beyond) would be impossible. Yet here I am, officially 100 days into my sobriety. 

The urges have seemingly disappeared over the last couple of weeks alone; though I'm not holding my breath that the urges will remain forever gone. 

It has now been a little over 3 months since my last suicidal tendency and the only depression I've experienced is the natural situational depression - like being out of work for a week sick and falling behind on finances. But even with that being said, I have no little devil on my shoulder whispering into my ear that drinking will numb all my worries for a night and that I can just start again tomorrow. 

This journey is teaching me that anything is possible, if I want it bad enough. It's teaching me that my willpower and determination is much stronger than I ever thought possible. It's teaching me that I am in control of me.

Alcohol was my gauze that I wrapped myself in to keep those lows of life - those uncomfortable emotions and realities - at a comfortable distance. When I quit drinking and that gauze disappeared, it got way too real. So I smoked more and more pot to cope. My discovery of oil cartridges meant I could get high pretty much everywhere, anywhere, anytime, all the time. I had my gauze in place again, and it kept me away from drinking.

I was the worst alcoholic I knew. I had such shame and guilt and self loathing for things that I did and I felt so alone because nobody did shit like that. I am here to tell you, you are not alone.

I committed suicide. My bf at the time came home just an hour after he left (instead of 8) and found me unresponsive. I woke up the next day in the hospital pissed and on a 5150. I talked my way out of it, telling the shrink that I ""accidentally"" took too much of my sleeping meds. I actually convinced myself that was the truth and didn't face it until I was in rehab years later.

I drove Lyft drunk and in blackouts. I justified it because I don't like dealing with people, so I'd get a little blurry and I got great ratings. But you know how we do, it escalated from blurry to tipsy to drunk to blackouts.

I have pissed my bed so many times that it just became reflex to tilt it against the wall to dry when I left for work.

I pissed in my driver's seat, more than once.

I drank a Costco sized bottle of vanilla extract because it was the only thing in the house with alcohol and then gaslit the shit out of my mom about it which was particularly dispicable because 1. She's a recovering alcoholic (36 years) and 2. I have been gaslit and know how terrible it is.

I got drunk on the bus, got lost and was so faded I couldn't figure out how to get home and couldn't get an Uber because I drank my last money, only had a bus card.

I have lost or broke more than 1 phone in blackouts. Purses, keys, jackets, etc.

I have humiliated my family in blackouts more than once and can't really remember how, just know it was *bad* from the wisps of memory I have left.

I got blackout drunk one New Years and cheated on my boyfriend with my ex and didn't even KNOW until 2 weeks later after my ex mentioned it. (I confessed to my bf and we got thru it)

I hit something in my car in a blackout and tore off the right front quarter panel. Found it the next morning and freaked. Told my bf at the time that I was going to go out for a bit and went to Pick-a-Part and replaced it, never told anyone till rehab.

I, who took autoshop in high school and knew better, had 2 oil changes in 8 years and seized my car's engine, bricking it. 

I drank at work and ended up losing my job of 15 years. 

Lost my apartment. 

Hit more than 1 parked car and never left a note. 

And more but I think this is enough. 

21 months ago, I admitted that I needed help, at age 46, after 30 years of abuse. Took 2 months to get into rehab.

I was terrified. Totally. I felt like I was alone. But I wasn't. There I learned that there are many like me. Much like our skin, our stories differ, but strip that away and we are indistinguishable. We are not alone. 

I have +19 months now. It absolutely sucks to live with your parents at 48, no car, no job. But I started school to become an alcohol and drug counselor which I will finish in a few months. I have to start over from scratch but that's okay. I have never had a sober adult life and I am grateful and excited to now.

You are not alone. Just because we know the dark places that doesn't mean we can't come into the light.

It dawned on me that drinking/relapsing (again) is tantamount to ripping out the all new updated and improved electrical wiring in a brand new house.  Alcohol wants and waits for me to destroy my rebuilt home.  Why would I want to rewire my entire house AGAIN?!    It also helps me remember that like Annie Grace says in her book “This Naked Mind”, in sobriety we are rewiring our brains, and taking a drink will not only awaken the cascade of cravings and bullshit, but will leave us alone in an empty dark dilapidated house.

But the weirdest thing happened on my lunch break. I went to the gas station and was going to get a lunch beer even though I felt awful, figuring if I forced some dog hair I might feel better. Before I could turn my car off this girl walks up to my window and I figured she would ask for money. She looks at me like a little kid that can’t get the straw into their juice box and says “Can you roll this joint for me? I had a stroke a few years ago and my fingers can’t do it.” What!? Get in here right now. That’s one thing I can DEFINITELY do for you. I rolled up her joint and we smoked a bowl and talked for a few minutes, and before she got out asked for my phone number. It felt so good to be able to help someone along in their time of need and I can’t remember the last time someone said I was a really nice person. Sent her a text just now, just a hey and a take care and a glad I could help. I hope she’s okay and gets back to me because I got the impression she’s got an opiate problem and lord knows I’ve been there. Even as bad as I need help I always wanna help anyone if they really need it. Plus she was kinda cute in a goofy Velma sorta way.


But I couldn’t stop thinking about all the stupid drunk shit I said over the last week. All the insane paranoid accusatory texts I’m probably scaring people with. The blathering bluster that I’m gonna do and say whatever I want and nobody’s gonna get in the way of my fun. But it’s not fun to reflect on. It sucks to feel like a huge embarrassment to your friends and feel like you can’t go anywhere anymore because you’re That Asshole. I kicked my own ass inside my head all day except for those ten minutes in the car rolling a joint for my new friend that doesn’t think I’m an absolute shithead. It got so bad I couldn’t breathe and I thought that heart attack I’ve been waiting for was finally here. I had to leave, I was useless and scared. Thankfully my boss understood when I told her I couldn’t do it anymore, that I needed to go home and take a shower, hug my mother and go to sleep. I didn’t drink beer on the way home, usually I down three on the way to my night job. I’m tired of that fucked up jerk. Everybody else is too. I’ll never heal if I don’t keep the wounds clean and dry.


So here’s to day one again. To saying no to hurting myself and making others hate me. To watching Jeopardy with my family and then sleeping in a bed even if it’s cold and lonely. To the weird serendipity that made my act of kindness for the day rolling a joint for a stranger. To learning how to be professional in every aspect of life, not just work. To spending my money and time, efforts and thoughts on more meaningful pursuits. To getting the fuck over it and moving on. This is the way.

I wanted to share that today is my 3 year sobriety anniversary. 

I am very proud of myself not only for the 3 years but for getting through the past few weeks  (one fo them in particular) still sober.  There was a time in my life that would have seen me hit the drink pretty hard to “cope”.

In one week I was told:

The Friday:  that my 58yr old (alcoholic) sister had been hospitalized with pneumonia and advanced stage liver disease and won’t be leaving hospital this time.  The doctors have said there is nothing more they can do for her and it’s now up to her body to fight now.  

The Monday: two separate friends announced their cancer diagnosis 

The Wednesday: one of those friends (younger than me) passed away.

All while trying to move house

I am proud and grateful that I have been able to grow in such a way (& importantly for me have a supportive partner) that I now do not turn to alcohol for comfort.  

3 years yay - something I can honestly say would not have been as easy (wasn’t always) as it was without Reddit.  I have been able to process my feelings and thoughts in a much healthier way (rather than drowning them).

I wanted to share about the last few weeks for those who may be having a rough time and to give some comfort that it is possible to push through while remembering everyone’s journey is different - but if you are struggling never forget you have this group for support ❤️

That's fantastic advice if an appointment for a new enrollment wasn't in FUCKING JUNE. 

I probably need some benzos to help me with my crushing insomnia that makes me unable to do work. Pretty much retarded most of the day and just desparate to sleep at night but here I am day 3 (I think) with maybe a total of 3 hours of sleep broken up into 15-20 minute chunks.

How the fuck am I supposed to get a medical detox with librium or something that actually helps if I'm unable to see a doctor for the next 60+ days? I can't. How am I supposed to deal with it until then? I can't drink because my insides are all torn up and I can't even see anyone until then much less get a prescription (which is not a guarantee because some doctors just don't prescribe it, for any reason)

When I previously had a different insurance, my GP said ""Go to rehab, your work will understand."" Sure, not even 2 weeks in this guy is going to take a month off. That sound like a great way to get fired and lose access to everything.

ER? They just give you some fluids and kick you out. Urgent Care? They just shrug their shoulders because, maybe I missed the memo, but there is a standing order among every single one that they don't prescribe benzos under any circumstances, ever, not even at gunpoint. The only exception I imagine is if you go in and have a seizure right in front of them, then maybe.

I have only ever drank on the weekends for about the last 1 1/2 years. It’s not interfering with any job, relationship, or any commitments. The thing that got me to start thinking about quitting was when I went into the after hours clinic with some abdominal pain and found out it was just gastritis. They took a ct scan and also noted that I had very mild fatty liver.

My doctor said it was because I am obese and not related to alcohol. He said I could still drink but I’d have to moderate heavily. 

The thing is is that I can’t get tipsy unless I binge drink. And even though my liver isn’t due to alcohol it definitely isn’t healthy for it. I just have so much fun with my friends two days a week that it’s hard to not join in.

I keep thinking about the fact that I’ve been doing this for nearly two years and have not developed any actual liver issues. 1 in 3 people in the world have my liver. 

I guess I’m asking the dumb question of “I think I can continue drinking for a while before I have to worry about actual liver issues so why not do it?”. 

I think it’s so hard for me to stop because the weekends are when I have any fun during the week and I don’t want to give that up.

It seems so innocent and everyone starts out early, and there are so many Euphemisms for it... ""Hair of the dog"", Bloody marys, mimosas, red beers, barleywine breakfast.

More experienced drinkers often ""help out"" newer drinkers early by cajoling them into a morning beer to get them through a brutal hangover.

Once you realize that more alcohol helps get rid of the awfulness that is left behind once alcohol wears off, your subconscious and conscious brain has just begun the process of addiction.

I started early... And I guarantee its what got me to the place I'm at now.

Early on it was just for long weekend parties... I didn't want to be a bummer in the morning, and I soon realized that instead of nursing a hangover all day, I could start drinking and just plow on through the day(and night).

Then, I had a few times where I drank for lunch event or something, then realized I was getting a hangover by bedtime and I knew I wouldn't sleep well, so id take a drink before bed.

More recently, I'd drink at night and realize I didn't drink ""enough"" to go to sleep without problems so I'd take a shot or three before I hit the sack. In reality that just because my tolerance was so high that i was getting withdrawals before the alcohol was even out of my system.

I would tell my husband ""just this last bottle and then I'll go a week for a while, then 2 weeks, then a month"" etc and then I could never even make it to one. I feel so bad about all the empty promises. But this time it's not empty. This time something clicked and I was just done. I was ready. Ready to quit instead of just trying to quit.

Then last night I had my second dream about drinking since I quit. Just like the first one in the dream I had I drank and I regretted it, but this time I couldn't even remember making the decision to drink, and I was really upset and frustrated because I was adamant that that is just NOT a choice I would have made. I had a panic attack in my dream and woke up. It felt so real but I'm glad it wasn't, and I'm really glad my subconscious knows that choosing to drink is no longer who I am.


I'm finally starting to feel a bit better. I've been really sick this whole time and I missed a lot of work, my check is going to be short and I'm sure so is the patience of my (amazingly supportive but still very small and short-staffed) band of coworkers, but I know I did what I had to do. And I'm glad I did it. I'm incredibly glad the fog is starting to lift though because I was getting really tired of a withdrawal limbo that never seemed to end. I was so disconnected it felt like I didn't exist or I was walking between the lines of the Matrix or something.  Two weeks has felt like 2 months, but I will keep going, one day at a time.

Almost all of my friends have been very understanding but for some reason, a friend decided to bring up embarrassing shit that I did drunk over the years, and having to relive those memories (many of which involved toxic things that happened with my ex) was very painful. I  spent the next day feeling pretty sad and burned out. This person is actually one of the catalysts that pushed me to sobriety, and it definitely does not make me want to drink again, but it really hurt to relive that on a day where I felt like I should be celebrating my life without alcohol. I am not that person anymore and having to listen to these ""funny"" stories really really sucked.

I am so proud of myself regardless. I  can say two weeks in things are beginning to kind of normalize, for lack of a better term. The initial \*whoosh\* of that first month is gone but  I feel really excited and a lot less nervous to live the rest of my life as a sober person. It feels like there's a lot of possibility in this new life I'm building for myself, and it sort of makes me giddy to think about :)  This group has helped me immeasurably, as I never really considered myself an 'alcoholic' or had any real desire to enter a program. I appreciate having other stories that sound like mine and it helps me stay on track.

The time is 1:38pm as I lay in my bead, in extreme pain... my head throbbing, my stomach growling, laying here pleading to feel better. The worst part... it’s not the first time. 

This is a direct result of a half bottle of vodka, drank on impulse last night... secretly, at my parents house, with my younger brothers at home. This is the grim moment I realize that this seemingly innocent substance, is beginning to take a hold of my life in ways I never could have imagined, however this is not the first time I’ve felt that it’s time to stop. I’ve had mornings similar to this at my own place in the past, but never gave it much though, “just a hangover it will go away!”. 

Not this time though... this is not just another hangover. This is the cumulative impact due to years of impulsive drinking and over-indulging. Years of ignoring the obvious path that has led me to this point. Years of suppressing emotions and avoiding feelings. With each drink a slight relief, but in reality each drink is like another scoop of dirt being shovelled from beneath my feet, sinking me deeper and deeper into this pit... and the ladder is nowhere to be found. Is this rock bottom? Is there a way out?
Shameful, is an understatement to express how I feel. But sometimes a person has to get there to realize what they do and do not want. 

I have a great relationship, loving family, amazing brothers, good friends and a career I love! Yes the pandemic had a huge impact as I was laid off, but I still love my career and know one day I will return. Yes, it was stressful and NO alcohol did not help... although it seemed like it at the time. Just take a sip, and a sense of warmth and calm and carelessness would overcome me... postponing my worries for another night. However postponing the stress and realities of life is like procrastinating on an assignment... you’ll have to deal with it eventually and you run the risk of doing a terrible job resulting in a shitty grade... expect with life you risk relationships, money, career and most importantly your health. Once those are broken they are very difficult to repair. 

So as I lay here, in this moment, contemplating how I got here... all I can say with certainty is that this is not who I want to be and this is not where I want to end up. I’m sure the journey to good things is never an easy one, but I know that I can be better and live happier than this. Maybe this is it for me, the bottom... and perhaps I’ll find a pickaxe and start etching away at the walls of this pit, creating a make shift ladder to get myself out!",14,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.58083546}"

And then I took the final step where I put my whole heart and soul into quitting and I stopped being so afraid of people finding out I had quit and what they might assume that meant. When I finally did that I hit on this 3 year and going streak I am on and never looked back.

The tools I used along the way: this sub, some books, and some podcasts. Those things plus my full commitment was all I needed. Credit to my loving partner who supports me as well.

I have been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. There have been times of severe alcoholism (a case of light beer and a bottle of Tito’s a day) and times where I was controlling it better (half a case of beer a day) but it has always been a part of my life in a pretty major way. I am 34 years old and I can’t remember a time where I wasn’t a heavy drinker. I am very functional (currently at or a little over a case of beer a day) but 4 days ago I decided it was time for a change. I’m not sure where it came from but I realized I was wasting my life and most of my potential on being drunk everyday. The potential to be a better father, a better husband husband, a better friend, to excel further in my career, the potential to enjoy my hobbies more, the potential to be healthy..... there are so many things I feel like I am missing out on by cracking a beer at 9am and drinking until I pass out. The withdraws have been pretty rough. Insomnia, seeing a lot of spots and just a general mild hangover feeling. Super anxious. The cravings are strange but I handle them and they don’t sit on my mind for too long if I keep busy. I started lifting weights on day 1 and have put in a little time everyday since. 

I am worried this is too easy. I feel like this should be a lot more difficult than it is for the amount and time I have drank. My attitude is nothing but positive about quitting and I am more excited than the normal “I’m gonna miss drinking” I usually feel when I think about quitting. I asked a friend a while back about how he quit (he has been sober since the late 80’s) and he told me “the only way you’re gonna quit is to stop pouring it down your fucking throat today, and never pour it down your throat again. You’ll be happier I promise”

So here I am on day 4. Trying to not let the thoughts of day 5 or any other day worry me. I am trying to not worry that this is too easy and the worst is yet to come. I am trying my best to just not drink today. I promise to myself and anyone who reads this IWNDWYT

* Trauma resurfaced at night. I have been a nightly drinker since I was 14 and I grew up in an abusive household with addicts. In order to cope I have been self-medicating with drugs and alcohol since I became a teenager. The first five days or so I kept having dreams about events from my childhood that I did not consciously remember. It was very difficult, to say the least, but also incredibly eye-opening.

* I have not been ashamed of myself in 11 days and it is the most freeing feeling I may have ever experienced. I have been having mental breakdowns every time I wake up hungover for the last few years and it has really put a strain on my relationships and mental well-being. It's amazing to go a week without ever feeling bad about myself...
* I have so much TIME. I'm reading my books. I'm painting. I'm playing video games. I'm exercising. And I STILL have time to sit and go on social media or what have you. I have regular hobbies again. That's crazy. 
* I remember every movie I've watched this week. I used to get drunk and forget the entire plot by the next day. I love remembering my life. 

I also want to say I was afraid of sobriety because I thought it would put a damper on my relationships, namely with my girlfriend. That fear has been completely unfounded thus far. She is entirely supportive of me and our relationship is flourishing despite not drinking, although we have not been to a bar together yet. That is my next hurdle.

This is noteworthy, because I am notoriously tight as a drum, but only when it comes to myself. I think part of it comes from growing up really poor. My husband grew up really poor too, and we came out of the experience with two different mindsets. He fucking loves spending money (don't worry, he's not a shopping addict or anything, he knows to stay within a budget and it's always fine. But he fucking loves it. It makes him happy.) And then there is me, and I fucking hate it, specifically when it comes to myself. We aren't rich now by any means, but we are comfortable. And if the kids want something (within reason, and with caveats so they don't turn into complete brats like ""Okay we will buy that video game for you, but you have to do XYZ chores to earn it first"") or if husband wants something (within reason, if it's not going to break the bank) whatever. They want it they can have it. But when it comes to myself, I never want to spend money, even on things I actually need. Again, part of that is I think a reaction to never having money for anything as a kid, but I also think maybe it's a self esteem issue, like I don't think I deserve things. Several times a year, my husband has to basically ""bully me"" (not really bullying, not being mean, but not taking no for an answer) into buying new clothes or new shoes for example, so that I'm not wearing rags. He almost lost his mind last spring when he noticed that my sock was wet because I was walking around on a rainy day with a hole in the bottom of my shoe. It's like a pathology for me, like I just feel so guilty spending money on myself (except for booze, never thought too much about the hundreds that were coming out of our checking account every month on booze.)

So this is an ongoing issue in our lives together, that if he doesn't basically make me get things for myself, I won't. It drives him a little crazy.

Yesterday we were at the store, and I saw a shirt I liked. It's really cute. So I stopped and looked at it, held it up to myself, looked at the price tag, and it was $30. My first (always) instinct was to put it back. He was watching me with that familiar look of ""Christ, you want the shirt just get the shirt."" So I didn't say any of the things I would normally say ""too expensive"" ""I don't need more shirts"" ""maybe after we get paid"" et cetera. I just put the shirt in the cart. Even with his mask on I could tell he was surprised and pleased. I felt surprised and pleased too. I'm 40 years old and I have a job and if I want a $30 shirt I can have a $30 shirt, damnit.

I bring this up not to brag that I could afford a shirt, but to talk about how lack of self esteem can drive so many of our weird habits, like not thinking that you deserve a new item of clothing, or like thinking that you don't deserve and are not capable of a happy sober life. So many of us struggle with thinking that we aren't good enough or strong enough for sobriety. People won't like us if we're sober. We may not like ourselves. But the truth is, we are worth it. We deserve sobriety. We deserve to get the things we need, and even some of the things we just want. We don't need to be trapped in this cycle of hurtful thinking. We. Are. Worth It.",33,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5836019}"

I have checked this sub every day and it has been a huge influence and motivator.  Along with Craig Beck's books and the app I Am Sober, this feels different and I have confidence to battle this addiction.

Near the start of the year I was wrapping up a 3.5 year binge.  I've been working from home since October, and my fiancee came home and found me passed out.  This was the third day in a row of blacking out.  She sat me down and told me that it couldn't go on like this.

I gave up on my fight to try and quit. I heard all the stats that 95-97% of people relapse and don't remain sober.  I had tried so many times.  I was resigned to the fact that I was just one of those people that were never going change and my life was going to remain a drunk one.  I was spending over $1000 a month on alcohol.

I went to the doctor 6 years ago - high liver enzymes, fatty liver disease, and on my way to continuing a life of pain.  I'm only 34.  I accepted if I was lucky I would have a decade left, but only so I could continue drinking.  I've only stopped once for 6 months but I was smoking weed the entire time.

Anyway, this time withdrawal came on as strong as ever - I usually would need either beer or hard seltzers to help me in the morning from the hang-xiety.  I thought I was going to have a heart attack, my sheets were soaked with sweat and all I could think about was just getting a drink for at least 2 weeks straight.  

But it got better, one day at a time.  the first month I ate whatever I wanted and had sweets.  The second month I picked up exercising.  The past month I have incorporated a heathy diet.  Each month I try to take on something different and add/remove it from my lifestyle.  This month is eliminating diet energy drinks and diet soda.  But hey, if I get one, at least it's not alcohol.  

During the past 100 days I've lost nearly 20lbs, saved over 3k, experience contentment and fallen in love with a new drug.....sleep.  I got word last week that my liver enzymes are now normal.  My relationship is much better and honest.  And my work, although boring at times, is going really well.  I realized my job or career does not define me - that was a struggle for a long time (i was in sales/recruiting for the past 3 years before this change). 

I'm happy to be alive.  Thank you for all your posts, comments and stories.  And to anyone new to this - you can do it.  I know you hear/read that all the time, but it is true.  The change is not overnight, but it is done one day at a time.

It's been around 4 months (I think, haven't been keeping track, quitting wasn't really planned) and that feels like justification enough. Honestly, the only reason I haven't yet is because I can't afford it.

But I know that if I get something, it's not just going to be one or two drinks one evening. I always have to finish the bottle over a few days, starting early in the morning. If it's a box of wine it's the same, drink 1 bottle worth each day until it's gone. Then the next weekend I'll get another, and maybe just not keep track of how many days pass before getting more.

And I'll become more depressed, anxious, and start having angry outbursts because everything is irritating while sober. I'll feel stuck in life because all I can focus on is numbing myself from the pain of it. The pain I'm causing by being too inebriated to take care of myself. The cycle will repeat for months, if not years.

Despite all this, I still want to drink. What is self control? Sometimes I feel so out of it, like my body is being piloted by addiction and my mind is somewhere trapped inside screaming to be let free.

It was well past “working hours” and I was still working on a presentation slide deck - a task which I hate.

I only drink really drink friday-saturday (sometimes sunday when I am so hungover) and have no real problems abstaining on the other days. However, when I do drink I just can't mentally stop the compulsion of drinking. I genuinely think it's related to OCD or something. Like once a 6-pack is opened I have to rush to drink it, I'm talking like 15-25 minutes max per six-pack. Anyways this weekend's antics might be the last straw. All week I was preoccupied about how much I would be drinking on the weekend because I had a party, all week I was going over in my mind not to get too drunk because there were people there I wanted to talk to and it wasn't really the scene (more of a formal party of sorts). Any whom this just further compelled me to buy a CASE, A WHOLE F\*\*\*\*\*\* case beforehand and polish it by myself leading to the party. I think this has a social anxiety element to it also.

In this period I have dropped 50 pounds and started to address underlying mental flaws that were hiding dormant from the heavy drinking. 

Now, when I got out of the hospital I was a wreck. I didn’t know how to function without alcohol anymore and struggled quite a bit. I reached out to some AA / NA friends, but I was never welcomed in that community because I refused to give up weed. I’d rather not debate this, but I’ll say without Mary Jane I’m not sure I would have been able to sustain being sober....

Anyway, I don’t buy into being unable to control myself. I have proven to myself on multiple occasions that I can defy the odds and frankly, I don’t see the reason to deny myself pleasure. I am not trying to drink every day again, but rather allow myself a few special occasions per year. It should be noted when I was drinking I rarely slurred, I never got aggressive, never had a DUI, etc. The only victim was myself.

I took some time off work and never went back, I'm on income protection insurance now. I was making steady progress, kept changing meds but slowly improving.

The last month of not drinking has been like taking off weighted boots. I feel like I'm in my early thirties again. I'm looking at my wife like she's brand new to me, I'm laughing with my kids every day. My wife keeps commenting that the doc finally cracked the right type and dose for my meds, but I know different. I used to think I drank because of depression and anxiety, now I wonder if this poison hasn't just been riding me for almost three decades, whispering in my ear that I need it.

I legit feel like a new man. Still seeing doc and psych and taking meds, I'm not throwing it away, but holy shit.

I hate myself that I waste so much time drunk instead of spending it once   people that once were a huge part of my life.

2021-04-22 02:35:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mvyxfa/today_im_one_year_sober/,Today I'm One Year Sober,"Hi everyone. I mostly just lurk on this board and post the occasional comment, but with a year of sobriety now I thought I'd make my first post.

A year without drinking. It's probably cliche but I never thought that would be me. I can't say that I personally reached a rock bottom or was drinking heavily every day for long stretches. What I did eventually notice is that I was repeating a predictable cycle with alcohol.

It went like this. I'd drink just a little to stifle bad feelings or boredom, feel worse in the morning, drink slightly more the next day, repeat. Eventually I would either do something I was ashamed of while drunk or drink enough to have one of those ""I'm never drinking again"" hangovers. So I'd stop and that would last a week, maybe two. Then I'd start up again, just drinking a little and the whole cycle would start over again.

Last year while we were all locked down I was working from home and nearing the end of one of these cycles. This one had the potential to be particularly bad, I realized, because I live alone and wasn't leaving the house for anything. I found this board and some other media about sobriety and just decided I knew where this was all going. Every time was more or less the same but this time I was done for good.

I had cravings, about four days of serious discomfort, insomnia, and some binge-eating, but I was surprised that I was able to do it by just thinking about what was good for me today. I didn't think about how hard it would be to never drink again, or about the possibility of getting to a year. I just thought about 1 day and how I didn't want to be depressed or hungover.

It actually became harder about a month in, when the thrill of feeling physically healthier and mentally clearer wore off and just became normal. Then I had to figure out what I was actually doing, how I was feeling, and what I would do when I wasn't drinking. I used to just binge during weekends, not really make plans.

I'm still figuring this out and have a lot of work still to do. 

Having said that, here are some things I've noticed.

I wouldn't say that my mood has greatly improved overall. I'm not a generally happier person. What I will say is my moods are far more neutral and manageable, which I'm grateful for. I'm more aware of my moods now and can reason through negative emotions before I snap at someone or do something impulsive. I'm more able now to reflect on my moods and understand what's causing them, where before I was less aware and just ""in it,""

I'm a person with depressive tendencies and I can say that for certain now that I'm not taking depressants all the time. I'm not always great at bringing myself out of these states, but I'm more aware of them now and hope to actually do some work to improve my abilities to manage this moving forward.

My memory has improved. It's still not great, but it's not the fog that I lived in before. 

I still don't know what to say to people who want to go out for drinks with me. This isn't because I don't want to go, or am avoiding being around alcohol. I'm comfortable being around people drinking and have done so multiple times over the past year. I just don't want to talk about my sobriety very much around most people. I'd prefer it be mostly a personal thing. Still have to figure this one out though!

Being sober has allowed me to fall in love with reading. I could never read in the evenings when I was drunk all the time because I'd get distracted or not remember what I read the next day. Now I read almost every day and I'm really proud of that.

I never realized this before I got sober, but I botched some relationships, lost some friendships, failed out of some jobs, even dropped out of school due in part to my drinking. I've been thankful to have a lot of second chances along the way, but I can't fix some of the things that I absolutely would have handled differently if I were sober. I'm almost thirty, but I still feel like I'm getting out of this young. Although I have some regrets, I'm happy that I can move forward now with a clearer perspective of what to avoid. Lots still to do, let's do some of it together.

I started dating someone 2 months ago. He's wonderful - a truly caring, funny and intelligent man who I'm insanely attracted to as well. Meeting him really took me by surprise, and that rarely happens for me. Our feelings for eachother are developing at a steady, healthy pace.

I know that the general consensus seems to be that it's not a good idea to date in the first 6 months to a year of sobriety. This does make sense, but at the same time the thought of ending things makes me miserable. I may honestly regret it for the rest of my life, because I've never connected with someone in this way.

He has no idea about my drinking issues. Most of our dates have featured alcohol in some way (usually just a glass of wine or two with dinner). We've only gotten drunk together once.

I'm going to his house for dinner this weekend, and I'm trying to prepare something to say when he inevitably offers me wine. I know I should be honest and not downplay my reasons for not drinking. I think he will handle it well, but part of me wonders if it's a turnoff for social drinkers to date someone who plans on never drinking again.

My two options for telling him are:

A. Tell him I'm not drinking for a few months for health and fitness reasons, and then will reassess whether I want to drink again.

B. Tell him I plan on never drinking again. My relationship with alcohol isn't a healthy one, and it's become a coping mechanism for negative emotions. Alcoholism runs in my family, and I want to quit while I'm still in a relatively good place, before it gets worse. Our dates don't have to change, I'm confident I can go to bars with him and just drink NA beverages.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Let’s talk tools!   
 

A sobriety toolbox is a collection of healthy (or healthy-ish) coping mechanisms for both handling stressors and for building a good foundation for when stress does eventually arrive.   
 

That might be running, yoga, tarot, weightlifting, journaling, walking, posting here, meditation, “quit lit” or meetings. For me, this also includes dog training, gardening, and aquascaping (head over to r/plantedtank if you want to find great ways to blow all that money you saved by not drinking!)  
 

My relationship with my toolbox and “coping” in general has shifted a lot in these almost-five-months. In the beginning, not drinking opened up a lot of TIME for me, and that empty time caused a real panic. I walked the dogs to death, I did yoga, I read SD for hours. At around 40 days, I started to do meetings on Zoom. When I wasn’t doing meetings, I was reading quit lit. What started as “oh hell, I have time to fill” turned into me throwing myself into recovery in every way I knew how. It started to take precedent over my relationship with my partner, other hobbies, and work started to end up on the back burner.   
 

I went through a transition period about a month ago where I acknowledged that I still had to live my life, and I started listening to podcasts and reading books about something other than recovery. I skipped meetings sometimes to cook good food with my partner. I don’t meditate every single morning. I journal when I need to.

For anyone struggling today, I'd to share my flashback that reminded me why I'm not drinking... Hope it's ok may be a little untraditional. I'll try to keep it short. 

Background:
At this point in my life I'm probably 24-25. I had a hard but  fairly good paying job, little debt, long term gf.
Flashback:
 I look at the clock its about 11am, its time to go pick up my (now) wife from her parents house. Been drinking since she went to go spend time with them in the morning but I'm definitely fine to drive, right? Keys, phone, wallet and might as well have a shot for the road, because of course right? Oh wait I already drank all the vodka. Damn, better stop by the store on my way and grab a tallboy for the road. Ok, got beer now time for my 30 min drive. Drive by a foresty area pound the beer. Throw the can out the window, like I'm cool and not a POS. Drive maybe 10-15 more mins. Driving with traffic not doing much wrong, speeding or otherwise (I think). See a cop in a usual spot, think to myself oh shit act normal. As I pass the cop he pulls out behind me. I also have way out of state plates at the time. Start thinking oh fuck this is it get going to to pull me over. As we drive I try to make a hard to make left with lots of on coming traffic, hoping to put distance between me and the cop. By trying doing that I pulled out in front of another car to fast and caused them to have to break moderately hard. The officer immediately lit me up with lights and sirens. I pulled over immediately shitting my fucking pants. We talk, I blame it on being from outstate and the gps. Turns out he was planning to stop me for speeding anyways. He also said he could give me a ticket for the phone (gps) and pulling out in front of that other driver. I apologized and he told me to wait in my car. I knew I was definitely fucked. My life over, my wife's life burdened with this, money gone, any success I hoped to have over. I didn't know what I was going to do. I had a half full hot red bull in my car from about 3 weeks ago, I drank it hoping to mask any smell. The office eventually got back out of his car. I was ready for him to tell me to get out, when he handed me just the speeding ticket. Told me to be more careful and I could go. In shock, I drove down the rest of the block and took a couple turns to another area and cried for a long time. 

I definitely don't think that I deserved that at all. And I wish I could say that's what made me stop drinking. Idk why God spared that from me from that. Some days I think he was sparing my wife from that pain. Cause even though I didn't go to jail or loose my job. I still feel disgusted and guilty about my actions and the consequences that could of causes to not just my family but especially to other family's. And even though that should have been a wake up call it wasn't and I proceeded to drink the next 3-4 years of my life away. Which compounds on the original guilt and disgust of the entire thing. 

In a way I guess me feeling this way has started to be good not just because it's a reason to be sober but to be a better person. Been trying to stop for more than a year now. I did good in the beginning then I slip up for a week or a month or three..... But whatever I'm trying. It's getting easier to quit each time.

I can’t just coop myself in my apartment. Although it may seem hard, and I know some of them will try to get me to drink, but I will not drink with them. Some of them will try to get me to use drugs or smoke again, but I will neither use drugs nor smoke again.

I got a little upset with them, then my mom started in on what it was like to watch me hallucinate while in the er and she felt like she was entitled to be concerned. Whatever, but I did not and am not drinking. Anyway, that segued into this argument we got into at the hospital when I started using my laptop and then had an episode. She was trying to help me watch movies from my external hard drive. I apparently yelled at her and the nurse because it wasn't working. I have always worked with computers and am a dev at a mid size software company so even though I was half all there I still felt I was right. Fast forward to yesterday to see what's going on with it like a month later. Found out there was file corruption along with some weird software that came over when my vpn failed. Turns out even on ativan in high doses and hallucinating I can still diagnose a problem. Doesn't sound like a big deal but I got a kick out of it.

I can't believe that I managed to give up the drink that was consuming almost all my waking thoughts, and almost all my free time, for 5 years running.

As I'm reflecting on the past year, I wanted to share a few things with you guys that were a bit of a disappointment for me in sobriety, so those of you in the same boat might feel encouraged that you're not alone.

It seemed sometimes to me that the land of the sober is unintentionally portrayed as a magical unicorn land where everyone loses weight! is super positive! has a good sex life! no longer has health problems! makes more money! has better friends! etc etc etc etc.

And I want people to know that it's not actually like that for some of us (most of us??)

And yet, for me, even if sobriety isn't magical unicorn land, it's definitely better than drunk land, by a landslide.

So, some things that didn't come true for me that I expected:

1. **I didn't lose weight.**  Frustrating! Sometimes it seemed like every other post I read was like, *""Yay I stopped drinking yesterday and I've lost 50lbs already!!""* Meanwhile here I am, 364 days later and I literally lost NO weight from giving up alcohol, and only a little bit so far (8lbs) from diet changes (only 72lbs more to go!)  But it's ok.  I'm still getting tons of benefits from not drinking that are not weight related, and I've solidified some great exercise habits, and my skin is clearer, and my ability to manage my health is so much stronger, so even if the weight doesn't come off, I feel so much healthier sober.
2. **My life didn't change in huge, sweeping ways, quickly, or otherwise.**  Sometimes  it seemed like every other post I read here was like *""Yay I stopped drinking yesterday and I've already found a new better job and I don't need my anxiety pills and I'm no longer depressed and I'll probably go save the whales tomorrow!*""  Ok ok ok I kid, you guys.  But seriously, I am JUST NOW moving to my own place, a year later.  I'm still in my old, less than stellar job, I'm still single, and while I'm definitely more interested in my life of the mind, I'm also playing video games and watching Twitch Streamers a lot.  And that's ok.  I have goals, and I'm turtling my way towards them.  I feel confident that I'll get there, and no matter what, I'm still winning, and my life is still changed, because I'm not drinking.  It's just not like a huge magical change.  (Not yet at least!)
3. **My family does not understand how hard this has been, or why I'm doing it.**  I **still** get comments from my family about how I need to ""go get a glass of wine to relax"" because ""you earned it"" and it's been a year.  Like, what?  Did you not hear me talk about why I'm sober?  My brother wants to hang out in wine country on a family vacation while they go get drunk and I .... watch the kid??  I sent a text to my other brother about being sober for a year and he...didn't even respond???  So....yeah.  I don't think they'll ever get it.  But I'm committed, and I have this community (thank you!), and a couple of close friends, and that's enough for now.  If I ever need to, I know I can reach out to the broader AA community to get support, and that's enough for the future.  But sometimes family be like that, and it's not a reason to go back to drinking.

And while I'm at it, a few AWESOME things that surprised the heck out of me in my non-magical sober life:

1. **Being sober at parties is a freaking superpower.**  When everyone else is getting drunk, you are all the sudden 5x smarter and 10x wittier than them.  NGL, it's amazing.
2. **No one I've told has been a dick about my sobriety.** Almost EVERYONE has told me they want to cut back, or expressed curiosity, or surprise.  The few people who were less than happy about it?  We're not friends anymore, and that's actually just fine.
3. **I can relax without alcohol**.  I KNOW, RIGHT?  I had no idea, or maybe had just forgotten. NGL, I was legit scared about this.
4. **I can go camping without alcohol.**  I KNOW, RIGHT??!! I thought camping required beer, period.  Now I actually enjoy the outdoors MORE because I don't haze it all out with alcohol.   You know what's amazing?  The night sky, glittering and clear, with stone cold sober eyes to see it.
5. **I ""do more things"" sober.**   This one is not surprising to me at all, but bears mentioning.  I have so much more curiosity about the world and what I might do in it now that I'm not just sitting on the couch every night with a beer in my hand...waiting.  Waiting for what?  I don't know.  What I do know is that I'm no longer waiting, I'm doing.  And it's way more interesting.

Love you all so much.  Thank you for being such an awesome support to me during this first year of what now feels like freedom.

Sorry long post about choosing not to drink and a coincidental good thing that happened after.

Maybe this isn't how it works, but i was ready to drink again. I was having a strange time and had really sad thoughts running through my mind when i got a text about a friend at a bar i usually frequent. And i almost immediately got up and went. I waited and tried to distract myself and it wasn't working  i was getting more upset. I left and even started driving towards the bar. But i took a wrong turn and continued to loop around and went home. I was near tears because i was upset when i got a text. A text i really needed and loved. A text pretty out of character to be honest. 

If i had gone to the bar i would not have appreciated the text. Or maybe who knows i would never have gotten that text. I would have upset a lot of people and hated myself tomorrow. But i didn't. i came home and had a good time here and got what i needed done, without a single drink. Stay strong.

Dear Alcohol-

I knew I loved you the first time we met. You were so comfortable. You made me so comfortable. You were what I was looking for when I didn’t even know I was searching. You silenced the doubt that stifled me.  You let me live in the middle of the chaos, in the moment, where I had never dared to set foot. With you, I could be everything I harshly judged and envied secretly. You told me that the walls I built around myself couldn’t hold me. That I could walk right through them. That I could step out into freedom. And I could, but only for a time.

Every morning, when I woke up surrounded by those walls, it broke my heart. When the dream was over and the lights came on, you were gone, and I was there. Unchanged. But every time you called, I was there. You played the song in my head that wouldn’t stop until I was back with you. Relentless, forgiving, demanding.

I really thought I knew you. I learned, with time, with age, to appreciate your subtlety. The white-hot urgency mellowed to a glow that kept me warm when I was near, but I couldn’t stray too far before the cold began to creep in. And somehow, foolishly, I thought I understood. The warmth wasn’t your gift of comfort. It was the chain that kept me close to you.

I’ve given you almost everything, but I know you still want more. But what have you given me? Nothing but an illusion. The dream slips away and the walls are there. The cold is there. Just like it always has been, but worse, because I know it doesn’t have to be. The walls I built in my mind can come down, but not in an instant. I can break them down, with blood, sweat, and tears. As I work, I’ll get stronger. I’ll get tools. I’ll have help.

I want to go where we went, live how we lived, feel how we felt. But I want to be there on my own. I want to be there because I’ve broken down the walls and stepped outside. I want to know that when I wake up in the morning, it will be to the light of day. I want to warm myself with the glow of pride, accomplishment, and satisfaction.

If I listen, I can hear you playing the song. Maybe someday it will fade away. For now, I have work to do.

Yours no longer,

I don't have it in me to survive another round of this. 

What I'm doing differently THIS time:

1. I took full accountability for my behavior before, during, and after my latest episode. I made no excuses. I admitted where I went wrong and apologized, acknowledging that this is all I can offer at this moment. 


2. I sought professional help. I can't do this by myself. I need therapy. I likely also need medication, because I suspect I have a mood disorder that contributes to my relapses, but I'll leave that up to my therapist to diagnose. If I could figure myself out, I would have done it by now. 


3. I let my close friends know what was happening and what my plan is to fix it. Even the people I hurt have been supportive because I finally stopped making excuses for my bad behavior. A lot of healing happened when I took full responsibility and admitted I didn't know why or how I got this way, but that I no longer want to be who I have been in the past and I need support. 


4. I am posting here. Hopefully daily. You guys are part of my support system, too. I need you. So much. 


5. I'm making a big life change to match outwardly what I'm changing inwardly....I'm moving out of my state to a new home and starting fresh. This will take a few months, but as far as I know right now it's a go, and I'm so glad to have one positive thing to look forward to. 


So, new name, new attitude, new support system, new therapist,, and soon a new home. Let's do this.

One I trust because its never been there and that other one just lies so much. We don't like that needy voice. But I am thirsty they both agree. Thank god I posted yesterday about nonalcoholic beverages. I remembered some one said non alcoholic beer that sounded really good. Theres only two kinds there. Theres no ipas voices say what's the point. Better idea sangria hmm its sunny thats a good idea. Those come in huge jugs for cheap. Stupid stupid voice makes a good point. Other voice says can't have sangria with out fruit. True. Fruits on the other side of the grocery store. I grab some fresh fruit and some lime seltzer water. Because I was there for seltzer Hop water in the first place my trusty voice ensured me. And I came home. I cried. I put on a fancy dress and I am sitting on my porch in the sun with my fancy sparkling water looking fancy and feeling like I just might be ok. Thank you guys.

My mind always feels slow to react or ""blank"" sometimes, whereas I used to be able to think on my feet. I wonder if the drinking is why I don't like this job, and letting it slip away because of that is missing a massive opportunity. To learn tangible skills and stuff. I don't know, it's weird to think about and I'm super anxious about starting Friday. But at least I'm not drunk, and I'm not running from those feelings.

I'm having the urge to share my story. This is my first post here. I commented on a daily thread last Friday with every intention of not drinking that night, then my job hit me like a ton of bricks, and I proceeded to drink half a box of wine and ruin my Saturday.

I don't know how many times that familiar story has played out: I set the intention to not drink for a while, I mess up on day 1 or 2 or 3, then I say screw it, I already messed up, may as well just go back to daily drinking. But something was different about Saturday. I accepted my mistake and didn't let it completely derail me. So here I am day 5, and the headache, nausea, and chills seem to be past. I'm starting to feel good physically--better than I have in years.

I started drinking excessively in college, but then it seemed like the normal thing to do. When in Rome and all that. When I graduated amidst the great recession, moved back in with my parents, and started working a dead end kitchen job while paying my massive student loans, I felt like my life was over. Over the next couple years I gained a reputation in my small home town as the guy who was falling over drunk at the local dive bar by 7 pm daily. I recognized I had a problem during this period, but I didn't care. It was my way of committing a slow suicide...giving up on life.

There's a quote from The Shawshank Redemption I often think about when I'm feeling particularly low: ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" I wasn't really ready to get busy dying, so I got busy living. I quit drinking for 5 or 6 months, and I found a better job. I got a wonderful dog companion who helped motivate me to get outside more often. When I did start drinking again, it was an occasional drink or 2. It wasn't a problem, until it was. It was a gradual slippery slope. Occasional drink or 2 turned into occasional night of heavy drinking, followed by a couple drinks the next day to take the edge off the hangover, until I was drinking daily again. I wasn't getting blackout nearly as often, and that's how I rationalized it.

I spent the next 7ish years leading to this week drinking daily or almost daily. The frequency of heavy drinking continued to decrease, and I continued to use that to rationalize it. I would count nights where I had only 1 drink as ""non drinking nights"". Most recently, I was averaging 3-4 drinks a day, with heavy days being 6-8 (very rarely more, like last Friday).

I finally faced the fact that I have a real problem when I repeatedly tried to reduce my drinking to weekends or 3-4 days per week but just couldn't follow through. I also began to really feel the long term physical toll it was taking on me, and I realized my memory of the past 7 years is fuzzy at best. I may not black out like I used to, but alcohol has ravaged my memory of even times when I was sober. I can't seem to maintain long term gains in any area of my life (except maybe my exceedingly stressful career which I ultimately want out of). Running may be the clearest example: I've had the same running goals for 5 or 6 years, but my times keep getting slower, and the once very realisticvgoals keep getting further out of reach. My marriage is suffering; it's not going to end tomorrow, but I'm taking it down that path if I keep drinking.

tl;dr I'm finally facing the fact that I have a real problem, and I'm trying to make a lasting change. Glad I found this community.

It was roughly 1 year ago that I was down in my kitchen taking shots at night while my pregnant wife was upstairs laying in bed. I have struggled with alcohol and other addictions for years, I'm a former smoker as well. I must have tried to quit 10-15 times in the last 4-5 years, once having made it 6 months. It's impossible to measure, but I don't think I ever hit 'rock bottom'. I never lost a job over alcohol (though I did have to call in sick once or twice due to a hangover), never lost a relationship over it, never had a DUI, etc... But that shit was tearing me apart, no question about it. It was a major contributor to my mental health issues over the years.

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for years, and alcohol made that about a million times worse. I'd drink to escape and get some relaxation, and then wake up with the post-drinking panic/malaise/shit feeling. I'd not drink for a few days if I was feeling particularly down, but then inevitably that feeling would subside and I'd be back at it again. Like a lot of you, I'd excuse it as normal behavior, particularly easy to do in the US where drinking is such a huge part of the culture and is damn near celebrated (I assume it's similar in other countries but can only speak for my experience in the US).

Now I can proudly say I have been sober an entire year, and my 7 month old son has never seen his dad drink. The thought of my kid growing up with a dad who couldn't control his drinking weighed on my mind really, really heavily, and I think was finally the push I needed to get me over the hump.

So how am I doing? I've lost 30-35lbs, and exercise regularly. I exercised while drinking, but it was getting to the point that I couldn't run enough to keep up with the bad habits I had developed while drinking. I gained about 40lbs during the first half of my wife's pregnancy. I don't regret giving it up at all, and I am happy to say I don't struggle with it much any longer. I'll occasionally have the thought that 'hey a drink would be nice', but it is pretty easy for me to dismiss that now. Every time I say No it gets easier and easier.

But it's not all sunshines and rainbows. A year in and I am still trying to figure out who I am. Finding a career in particular has been a great challenge for me, one I still haven't solved. I have a good paying job right now, but am not passionate about it and feel stuck. My anxiety gets in the way a lot. But not drinking has allowed me to take a step back and look a bit more objectively at my situation, and not feel completely hopeless about finding the 'right path' eventually. I still find myself with downtime that I don't quite know what to do with (though I have less of that now with a 7 month old, lol). But, I know drinking will not solve any of that.

I'm going to start a free online course I found in drawing. I have absolutely zero artistic talent, and in no way is it going to help my career, but I continue to look for healthy outlets that will help me cope with my anxiety. And I wouldn't be doing any of that if I was still drinking.

So cheers, and thanks for reading. This community has been a great boon to me over the past 5 years or so. I don't comment a lot, but I regularly read posts and find a lot of motivation from stories others post. It's just good to know you're not alone.

I am so glad many people do feel good enough to wean off their medications for mental health issues in sobriety, but you are not weak or broken if you aren't able to.

It took me way too long to try an antidepressant, seriously, it took well over a year and a half after I got sober. Despite family and friends suggesting I needed more help, I fought against medication and I've hit some scary lows because of it. Yes, my mental health was better than it was when I was drinking but I shouldn't have been thinking the thoughts I had, especially with all the workbooks, therapy, social support and journaling I was doing in all that time.

I am not saying everyone should take medications, but sometimes you do need more help to protect your mental health, so this is a post for anyone who does still need to be on medication despite getting sober.

Went out with Jess last night to the yard house. Had a half yard of beer that I didn't finish and gave some to her. Woke up at 3:30AM and couldn't sleep, so at 4:30AM I grabbed some rum and drank a lot. I did then get back to sleep, but then I woke up at 8:30AM with a headache, so logically I drank more. What is wrong with me? I ended up eating shit and drinking even more, laying in bed feeling like shit until I finally threw up. Now I have some shitty heart burn, and I feel depressed. I got nothing accomplished. I cannot replace weed with alcohol. I need to make a change. I think I just need to be 100% sober, and that is terrifying. I probably should have went to rehab in 2013. I don't know how I've made it this far without dying. My body literally is mad at me for all the alcohol I consumed. I can taste it in my mouth, and it tastes disgusting.

I am going to make a change. I feel miserable, and this cannot be good. Right now all I'm thinking about is alcohol, but I know if I have any I will just feel worse. So why do I want it? I'm gonna either drink all the rum or throw it all out. Maybe I should look at alcohol like I do weed. Maybe I am all or nothing with it. Who knows. 

First I will set limits: no drinking by myself. No hard alcohol on the weekdays. No drinking before 5PM. I feel absolutely terrified. I should probably just cut out booze all together. I'm scared. Alcohol is worsening my mood. Whenever I want a drink, I am going to go for a walk. Keeping myself occupied will help me get over this hump. It's time to rediscover myself and figure out who I am and what I like to do. “

Shocker, those limits didn’t work and my disease got progressively worse until I got sober in June of 2019. I’ve been having extreme cravings recently and not going to meetings as often as I should. Finding this note was the universe’s way of reminding me that alcohol and drugs are not for me. Once I start, it’s extremely difficult to stop. So it’s just easier to not start.

Basically I feel as though I've come to a point where alcohol negatively impacts my life at times. It has caused stress in my personal life and fights in my relationship. My boyfriend gets understandably frustrated that I come home from work very often drunk.

It doesn't help that the office I work in, the environment is not very conventional. Every day around 3-4pm, my boss breaks out tequila and pours shots. We also have a constant supply of beer and this nearly always is paired with the tequila drinking. I very much enjoy hanging out and drinking with my coworkers every week night.

I feel now that I don't feel ""right"" unless I have a buzz going. I ALWAYS want to feel this way. I feel as though this is when I am happiest. 

I did get a DUI in August 2018 when I was 23 - I really cut back drinking excessively and NEVER drank and drove for about a year. Then slowly it built back up, at one point I would drink a beer in the mornings on my way to work. Now I drive over the limit very frequently. I recognize the issue but my buzzed brain constantly decides it isn't one. I know I'm basically asking for my 2nd DUI at this point.

In the last 6 months I had maybe 2 sober days... and it was because I was too hungover to tolerate the smell of alcohol. 

I don't want to drink so much, but I almost have no desire to stop at the same time. I feel so happy when I drink, but the issues it's causing in my personal life makes me realize it's a problem. 

The issue kind of came to a head last night when I met up with my boyfriend and he said I couldn't even speak right. We spoke in the morning and he mentioned that I am deciding hanging out with my coworkers drinking is more important to me than him. He's never cared about me going out, but the frequency of me doing this went from occasionally to nearly every day. Hearing him say that I decided drinking after work was more important, made me think.

I'm just in this weird spot because I just don't want to stop. But I recognize I should. I just don't know how to start when the desire to take a break isn't there.

I’m on day one (probably literally the 40th attempt) 
Feeling pretty rough but I don’t think it’s going to escalate to withdrawal thankfully . I’ve been at about a pint of vodka a day but was making sure to eat and hydrate often with pedialyte while drinking so it hasn’t been too bad but I’ve definitely been blacking out and I vomited this morning.

I have a 9 month old baby girl that deserves the world. I was sober throughout my pregnancy and for several months afterwards but I think I may have ppd and life has been rough working and doing the lions share of childcare (I actually bring my daughter to work with me)

Anyways I wanted to shout out to all of us on day 1 and hear what you’re doing today to get through and what your sobriety plans are.

Here’s my plan:
Survive work and drink as much water as I can and eat whatever I want and can (very low appetite)

I gave my partner my money and cards so I can’t stop for alcohol after work (short term solution while I get through the hangover without reaching for the bottle for relief)

I’m not forgetting these last few days though. The unbearable anxiety, complete dread for what I’ve done and what I may have lost, wondering how I’d let myself fall so far when I was actually doing fairly well last summer. I let the weather change be a huge excuse for my mental health and excuse to drink. Yes, the weather does affect me (pretty positive I have SAD) but that doesn’t mean I can drink my life away. I will not forget this. I will still do my 30 days, and then I’ll have a plan for after once I see how things go. I never want to feel the way I’ve felt these last few days again. I’m grateful for forgiveness, second chances, and the amazing support from this community and the people in my life. It won’t be easy, but living life drunk is so. Much. Harder.

My mind was in the “fuck it, how much worse can it get anyways?” area. I started justifying it, telling myself everyone drinks when they’re going through a hard time. In my brain, I was romanticizing the idea of drinking through a heartbreak, that’s what all the girls do in the movies. They lay on their closet floors or in the bathtub and drink a bottle of wine while sobbing, mascara running down their face. It sounded “therapeutic”    
    
I had a pack of claws right in front of me. I was so close. Then I had a moment of clarity and I realized that if I did drink, I would probably say something stupid. I would drunkenly sob myself to sleep. I would regret it in the morning. I would feel so ashamed.    
    
The thing that really stopped me was that I knew if I did drink, all day today would’ve been spent justifying my next drink and trying to plan my next drink. That scared me because this is the first time I’ve felt somewhat in control in awhile, and I don’t want to lose that. I didn’t end up doing it and I feel very proud of myself.

I drank every single day for decades, often 375ml of bourbon or tequila or vodka, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. I bought at least two 1.75 liter bottles at Costco every couple of weeks, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. I woke up every morning, not quite hungover, trying to remember how many things I had eaten the night before that I shouldn’t have, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. My dad was an alcoholic, and his dad was an alcoholic who died of the damage, and his dad was an alcoholic, but I wasn’t an alcoholic. I never showed up to work drunk, never drank in the morning, never had alcohol affect my relationships, so I wasn’t an alcoholic.

I had major surgery for prostate cancer a year ago, and didn’t drink for two months after that, and dropped almost 15 pounds. It was easy, so I wasn’t an alcoholic. I started again around my birthday, intending to moderate my drinking, but quickly went right back to the previous pattern and put all the weight back on, but I wasn’t an alcoholic.

I told myself I just drank more than I should, that it was a habit that just needed to be broken, but I never broke it.

One week ago, I looked in the mirror and said, “I’m an alcoholic.” And just saying it changed my mindset that instant. I’ve been sober for a week today. My anxiety has eased. I’m going to bed earlier and getting up way earlier, with energy to start getting stuff done around the house that I had been postponing. I’ve been fortunate to not experience withdrawal symptoms except a touch of insomnia and constipation; both will pass (ha!).

I know there will be challenges, but I also know I can do this. I quit smoking 33 years ago this month. I white-knuckled it because our daughter was due a month later and I didn’t want her to know me by that smell or to spend half my time standing outside to get my fix. I never had so much as a puff after that because I knew I wouldn’t stop. I don’t miss it a bit. There were physical and psychological triggers I had to get past, and I know it will be the same for alcohol. I’m ready.

Groups and programs aren’t for me, so I was glad to stumble across this subreddit. I probably won’t participate much, but it’s great to find a place where I can listen to other folks sharing their experiences. I’ve added it to the set of bookmarks I automatically open so I get a peek every day.

I’d had a fight with my partner. I was in pain. Today, 0 days ago, I’m not drunk. I’m not hungover. I’m still in pain.","However, it’s pain that I can actively push against. Something I can work through. I’m an engineer professionally and I have worked in consulting where selling services was the name of the game. As a result, there was no real limit to how much work there was to do, since there’s always a market to expand into, new practice to build staff to support, or new clients to pursue. My managers would always tell me that when it came to my career, it was a wide open plain without limits. But, being an engineer, I struggle with a lack of constraints. So, I set out to impose some. At first this looked like working my tail off. When I saw that this didn’t convert to more pay and responsibility in an economical fashion, I pulled back my efforts there and picked up my drinking. The increased drinking let me keep working at around 105% of my capability but having it feel like I was working at 150%. Obviously, I’m headed for burnout at the best, personal disaster at the worst. 

No matter how hard I worked, I felt stuck. Sure, the pay increased, as did the annual bonus, but the responsibilities didn’t change much and neither did the work. I was bored. So, I drank more and pulled back more on work. At the 90% mark of capability, I was still at 150% after the drink multiplier… and still feeling stuck. Then my dad died. Actually, then my dad got sued by a business partner with malicious intent and lost all his businesses, retirement savings, stocks, etc. *Then* my dad died. My capability level dropped to around 80% or less, but I made up for it by using parts of my five weeks of saved PTO. I was still working, but I was *really* drinking. Still felt stuck. Dad was dead. Little brother had died from addiction. Dad lost everything he had worked for at the drop of a hat. Little brother continually struggled to break free from addiction, but just couldn’t get out. What was to stop the same from happening to me?

I drank more. I’d always been a solitary drinker, but I really stepped up my game. Visibly, I’d cut down: at a party or after work, it was one or three drinks at most; but the empty cans and bottles hidden around the house and my secretive trips to the recycling bin told a different story. After everything else for the day, there were another 6-8 drinks with my name on them. And only *my* name. The hangover also had my name, but I had a cure for that: tomorrow’s drinking. The first sip after work, with friends was enough to kill the headache. Heck, the adrenaline rush walking to the break room to get that first drink was enough to stave off the headache. Who am I kidding… at 11:00 am, when my mind and body would sober up enough to realize that I’d drink on schedule after 4:00 was enough to keep me going. It was a trap, I was stuck. 

Previously, I’d tried to quit drinking. Sometimes I was successful. Oftentimes it was worth every minute of sobriety. Yet, each time, I tested the water and ended right back where I started. “Water” is incorrect; it should be, “...tested the alcohol...”. I was burned out on work. Burned out on drinking and, really, I was burned out on life. When the chance came along to switch jobs, I jumped at it. I saw a chance to reboot and reintroduce myself as a new person. One that didn’t drink. 

Only I did drink. I re-balanced some priorities and my work-life balance was one of them. I communicated clearly that I only wanted to work 40 hours a week and not only was my new boss supportive of that, they were enthusiastic I was committed to that because it meant I’d be a better employee! So we got some drinks to celebrate our understanding... oops. That part of the balance didn’t get fixed. Yet, what I felt my required effort at work was about 70% of my capability. And people still said I was doing too much. I kept drinking the same amount and life was easy. I didn’t think I needed to drink for stress (at work) anymore. So I gave stopping a try. About a month later I had a break down, suicide attempt, and subsequently started antidepressants. It’s better now. I mean, it’s not great, but I’m sober and alive. I’m working through whatever it is that led me to drink, but it’s a process. I’m in therapy alone and also with my partner. It’s progress. 

Really, it’s progress I’ve only been able to make with the clear mind granted to me through sobriety.

200 days sober. Many more days/years leading up to this and hopefully many more beyond. What a life, filled with highs and lows, and now I’m here, present and able to experience them. Wherever you are on your journey, I hope you manage to look beyond any immediate hardships and keep building momentum towards your goals. Whatever it is that brings you here, I will not drink with you today.",84,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6718223}"

We imagine ourselves in our own little fantasy when we drink. Mine is related to the 80s (even though I was born in 1990), house music, imagining myself being famous, rich, lots of women and friends in my life, a huge social media following, etc. When I drink, I kind of become that person in my head. But after a few days or a week of doing that every night you have to take a hard look at yourself and realize how far from that reality you are. It's pitiful really. You can see people who live out that romanticized, fantasy, alcohol driven lifestyle everyday on the streets. Or people who aren't homeless, but walk to the gas station in your neighborhood carrying a guitar and telling stories like they actually believe they are a super famous musician. ""I used to do this"", ""I used to do that"", ""I was big, huge!"". It's sad how disconnected from how others actually perceive them they really are. The truth is those people and ourselves, we are all amazing and have tremendous potential in us. When I read a lot of the sobriety posts here, I hear stories of people getting their finances together, doing big things career-wise, getting into great relationships, reaching these personal best fitness goals, etc. We are all great and have the potential in us to show that with external successes. But when we get into the romantic fantasy that alcohol reels us in with, we get further and further away from that potential.

Y'all I am so stoked by this.

Yesterday, I had a doctor's appointment I made because my anxiety about being sober was driving me nuts. I am frustrated because it feels like nothing has changed and I kept worrying about the severity of my liver damage. To help alleviate that, my doctor ordered a hepatic function panel to check the liver. The last time they did this was June last year. My numbers were AST 233 and ALT 132. Results came back to AST and ALT both 26. Hell freaking yes! I am so ecstatic. I was getting really dismayed about noticing anything improving but just seeing those test results makes it all the more real. I still have a liver ultrasound to double-check in a few weeks but this makes me feel so much better.

To say I didn't think I'd make it this far is an understatement. In fact, I fully expected this illness to take me. Somehow, I'm still here. I'm still working behind the bar, but sober. Through a fucking pandemic, sober. Through loss and pain and lonliness and regret, sober.

I'm not a deeply spiritual person but I think I'm finally starting to see, the universe has other plans for me.

My life doesn't look like what I thought it would at this point. It's immeasurably better than it use to be, sure. And I'm fucking grateful. But quitting drinking didn't solve all my problems, it just allowed me to clearly see what they were. I had problems in places I didn't know I had the space for problems. Life will never really be 'easy', there will always be obstacles. But sober, I'm tackling them instead of creating them.

On the darker days, I'm a vessel of regret for the bullshit I'd put my loved ones through, all the stress and pain and grief. Friendships I'd left in tatters, that couldn't be repaired.

On the good days, I feel okay. I even laugh at my former self. Younger me would be disgusted at how healthy my life is now. (That's okay, that guy was an asshole anyway.)

But on the best days, like today, I'm fucking excitied at the things to come, full of confidence and fire. There are still new highs to reach, goals to smash and hopefully, one day, a family with whom I can say, all the struggle was worth it, just to get here. I can't wait to meet them, even if it takes a bit more time.

I'm stronger than I ever gave myself credit for. But I didn't do this alone. So this is where I say thank you.

I told myself that I drank to control it, that if I had a few drinks every night then I wouldn’t have weekend blackouts and I would never get another DUI. I never got another DUI, but I had multiple blackouts. I started a shitty daily habit that I legitimized through my equally shitty logic.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

where everything began,

there is a small opening into the new day

which closes the moment you begin your plans.

What you can plan is too small for you to live.

What you can live wholeheartedly will make plans enough

for the vitality hidden in your sleep.

To be human is to become visible

while carrying what is hidden as a gift to others.

To remember the other world in this world

is to live in your true inheritance.

You are not a troubled guest on this earth,

you are not an accident amidst other accidents

you were invited from another and greater night

than the one from which you have just emerged.

Part of what makes the DCI so important to me is that it’s one of the very first things I do when I wake up, in that small opening into the new day before the plans set in. It’s one of the first plans I make, and I do it in community with all of you.   
 

What do you do in those earliest morning moments when you first wake up? Are you a morning person who takes a cup of hot lemon water, does your morning pages, works out and walks the dog right as the sun rises? Or does life crash into you with alarms, kids, hungry cats?",161,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.54278314}"

So apologies in advance if this is rather disjointed, as I'm editing in my head as I type.

My grandfather passed away last month, but the funeral service wasn't until today. I live in WI, but drove down to FL this last Sunday to attend the service, stay with my grandmother to help out around the house, and just spend time with her.

Until this last Sunday, its been since late January where I haven't gone a day without drinking a 12 pack of beer. Before then, I was still a heavy drinker, but not every day (heavy drinking 3-4 times a week).

I used to drink for fun, but since COVID-19, I've been very isolated. I'm working remotely for the foreseeable future, most of my family in WI didn't take COVID seriously, and I live alone. A nice little recipe for what was a lighter drinking habit becoming my main source of entertainment and coping with the isolation. There may be more to that, and I plan on seeing a therapist soon to dig more into it.

I wasn't planning on quitting drinking. I had a 12 pack the day before I drove down and figured I'll just have a few dry days leading up to the funeral and when people aren't coming around as much, then I'd resume drinking...maybe not every day, but I was already thinking of ways to conceal it from my grandmother. My FL family (my mom's side, as opposed to my dad's side in WI) don't drink, so there was no beer or any other alcohol around for the get-together we had after the service.

While the circumstances of me being in FL are very sad, I felt better physically today than I have in months. My mind is clear, no headaches or that cloudy grogginess of getting drunk every night. I want to keep this going and, as of right now, I have no desire to drink.

In fact, I'm actually challenging myself (with anything, not just not drinking) for the first time since I can remember in the last few years. And I'm excited.

I'm here for 3 weeks. Since its a change of scenery, perhaps its easier to abstain. So I'm going to work on a game plan for how I'm going to keep this going when I get home. I know I'm probably going to have some pretty tough conversations with family and friends upon my return, but those conversations will just need to be had.

I do find it interesting that I'm finding it very easy to not drink while mourning my grandfather. His passing has been absolutely crushing and I've cried a lot since I've been here. But no desire to drink at all. I'm not a religious man, but who knows, maybe he's out there helping me with this much needed change.

I have taken up running and yoga since quitting and am feeling great overall, but I've noticed that my circulation issues seem to be getting worse.

As my drinking got bad, I noticed that my fingers and toes started to feel numb more often and my veins were become more visible. Since I've quit, these things have gotten much worse. I've built up to being able to run 6.5 miles, but my feet are always numb by the 3rd mile from lack of circulation. My fingers regularly go numb now, even when sitting in my warm home office. Just now, I was looking at my legs and noticed that I have a new patch of super dark spider veins forming on the back of my leg. My vain ass almost started crying! Spider veins do not run in my family. I don't even think my grandmothers have them...yet here I am at 27 with a big web of them. I just feel like I've done so much damage to my body and it's pretty heartbreaking to see.

I would just like to hear if anybody else has had similar experiences! Not only with these specific symptoms, but circulatory health in general.

I figured I'd go 30 days, but felt really good and decided to go longer. After a month, I contacted my doctor for a long overdue physical. I just turned 35 and had put off the doctor for so long and thought I would see how I was holding up.

I went in feeling so strong and had my blood drawn on day 53 of sobriety. My liver enzymes were high (ALT 89/AST 75) and I was terrified. The doctor didn't seem too worried, but I don't think he was listening to me telling him how much vodka I was consuming. He told me to stay healthy and schedule follow up blood work a few months down the road.

Over the next couple of months, I worked out daily, ate a healthy diet and did all I could to try to better myself. I went in for my follow up blood work last Friday, which was my 110th day sober. I agonized all weekend about the results and just got them now. My liver enzymes are in the normal range (ALT 34/AST 24) and I have to admit, I let some tears of happiness flow.

This sub helped me so much during this time. I've seen other success stories about people bouncing back and I've seen a lot of people posting about being scared just like I was a few months ago. I don't know if I'm never going to drink again, but at the time being I don't really have the desire to. 

Thank you for all the support. If you're going through a similar situation, know that you're not alone and every day you don't drink is a huge accomplishment. Fight for yourself, you are worth it!

I can hardly believe it. 90 days ago I was at the bottom of a deep dark hole with no way out. I didn’t do AA after day 3, but regardless, tonight I’m enjoying my theoretical chip. There are many moments where it’s very hard, and I can’t sit still. I’ve gained weight from switching to chocolate and ice cream instead of booze. And I have regrets and broken relationships that can’t be fixed. But I’m not being ripped apart by anxiety every day, I’m not ill every morning, I no longer look like shit with puffy dark eyes and red nose. I can see my thoughts and emotions more clearly and I understand when it’s me and not “them” who is creating conflict. I realize how much the drunk drama was depriving me of a peaceful life. I miss the tingling rush of feeling euphoric for the first two drinks, but I know that I can’t even have one because I won’t stop. Maybe I would that first time, but the first time would lead to a second time and a third until I hit the one time that destroys me again, a matter of when not if. Meditation has helped. I set a daily alarm to remember how awful I was and reflect on who I want to be. I did a self-guided workbook on CBT for Dummies. A bit of Buddhism-lite has given me a framework for thinking about who I want to be. I got a new job and it’s going great. I’m thinking about ways I can make new friends and healthier relationships when lockdown is finally over. Im still trying to figure out what it means to be happy and have fun. I’m a little worried about what will happen when everything opens again, and there is temptation and pressure at every turn.

2021-04-20 18:01:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mv1l6j/im_a_20_year_old_alcoholic/,I’m a 20 year old alcoholic,"I can finally admit to myself that I am an alcoholic. I have been an alcoholic since I figured out the liquor store near my house when I was in high school would sell me booze without checking for an ID. I have had a problem since I was 17 years old. I have been called an alcoholic since I was 17 years old. I would always say I wasn’t but I was. I believed the lie that I was okay, that my drinking was okay and normal. 

I showed up to high school track meets drunk off my ass, somehow able to hide the fact that I was drinking after my races. I would drink before school, mixing alcohol with whatever drug I was doing. Getting crossed before school became a regular occurrence. Somehow I graduated and got into college. 

College only made my problems worse. I partied obviously but I would drink everyday, before class, during class, and after class. A 750 of whiskey in 2 days was easy money. I nearly died a couple times my freshman year. At one point one of my friends described me as having one of the faintest pulses they’ve ever felt. They almost had to perform CPR on me. And I still chose to drink after that. I laughed at that story. 

I tried to get myself clean in November of 2019. I went through withdrawal on the floor of my dorm room bathroom floor, thinking my heart would give out at any point, swearing that I’d never drink again. That didn’t even last. 

I kept drinking. I wanted to be “normal”. Like everyone else. Everyone else could drink so why couldn’t I? So I kept drinking. 

I finally hit rock bottom in January of this year. I was a vile and pathetic person excuse for a human being. I drunkenly fought with my girlfriend, the love of my life, solely because I was drunk and making stupid decisions. I cheated on her on New Years with my manipulatively toxic ex, something I may never forgive myself for. What I will also possibly never forgive myself for is how I drank an entire bottle of whiskey that night. I don’t even remember what I did. I can never forget that. 

That still didn’t stop me though. I nearly died a couple days later, drunkenly driving to a town 3 hours from my house to do fuck all. I tried showing off on a longboard after drinking half a bottle of whiskey and ended up slamming my head into cold hard cement at the end of a hill. I blacked out, not from the booze but from the impact of my head on the ground. I knocked out two teeth, injured two more. 

That *still* did not stop me. A week later I drove 5 hours from my university to my ex’s drunk off a bottle of Jameson and some Jose Cuervo. I made it there okay. I was drunk the entire time I was there though. I drove back drunk, I got pulled over drunk. I narrowly escaped a DUI. 

And yet that didn’t stop me. I still drank with my drinking buddies at the bars. I didn’t try to stop until I tried reconciling things with my girlfriend. 

Even then I didn’t stop. I’d swear I’d never drink again but I’d only make it 2 days at the most. I kept drinking even when I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. According to the psychiatrist I probably developed a drinking habit to self-medicate but in the end the alcoholism caused me to be more mentally unstable. 

But now I’m done. I’m actually done. I’m reconciling things with my girlfriend. I know that sounds stupid and I know I’ll get people calling me a dirty fucking pathetic cheater and a liar and I was, but i am in repair. I was a toxic person, I allowed alcohol to run my life. I was selfish for placing alcohol above the people I love. And I will no longer do that. 

So this is my fair well to alcohol. To never picking up a glass ever again. This is to becoming a decent human being. This is to mending and healing. This is to repair. And this is to recovery. 

I am above alcohol, and I will always be above alcohol.

1) I have now lost 20 pounds. I started around 262 and I hit 242 today. I was a big beer drinker, consuming at LEAST 70 beers a week. That's about 10,500 extra calories PER WEEK. And I would start drinking as soon as work was done, which often caused me to not feel like cooking, getting shitty take out, and then definitely not wanting to exercise.

2) On that note, I've picked up my hobby of cooking again. I make a delicious meal from scratch every single night now using fresh, healthy ingredients. It's so much fun and I really enjoy doing it.

3) Also now that I'm not hung over anymore, I've started waking up at 6am to exercise. I used to wake up at 8:30 to start my work day at 9, giving myself just enough time to jump in the shower and make a cup of coffee. Now I either run (couch to 5k program), do one of the 30 day yoga challenges with Adriene on YouTube (they're only 30 minutes, which is about as much yoga as I want to do), or do a random bodyweight workout I find on YouTube. Then I have between 7-9am to do whatever I want in the morning. I relax with my coffee, read the news, play with my dog, play some video games, or read.

4) My anxiety is basically gone. I used to basically spend 2-3 hours a day just randomly worrying that I was going to lose my job, or something bad was going to happen, just baseless stuff. It's all gone now. My days are just so much *easier* now with all this additional anxiety.

5) Weekends are the best. My lawn is looking great. My errands are all run. I've got some stuff done on my car. I make a big extravagant multi-hour meal. I go on long bike rides or hang out with friends. It's crazy how much extra weekend you get when you wake up at 8 ready to roll instead of 1:30pm and need the next 3-4 hours to figure out if you're going to puke or not. 

6) I don't hate staring at my face on zoom all day. It's not all puffy and my eyes aren't bloodshot. My skin looks good. It's noticeably thinner. Nice.

7) I have a new sense of optimism for the future. I feel in control again. I feel like I'm the one calling the shots and not the booze. 

8) It's nice to decide you want ice cream after dinner and be able to drive and go get it at 8pm.

Overall I can say it's been a really rewarding and empowering few weeks. I see absolutely no reason to go back and am looking forward to continue to grow, heal, and improve myself. Every night the last thing I do is check in on this subreddit, read a couple posts, and see all the IWNDWYT and it reminds me that this is something worth doing, so thanks to all of you for being such good people, always inviting and encouraging.

I’m in my 30s, I am “successful,” I am married and children and a great job and hobbies. I usually stick to 2-3 drinks, I never drink alone, I never drink the morning, I turn down drinks, etc.

But once in a while (at this point every once a year-ish), I get hammered and usually do something I regret and the next day or so is absolute shame and anxiety hell.

Two nights ago I went out to celebrate a personal victory. I didn’t do anything life altering but I know I could have. I cheated on my first husband when intoxicated 15 years ago and I’m always afraid I’ll do it again because I get *wild* when I party. I think all my repressed desires come out and I just don’t care about the consequences. The other night I flirted, threw up out of a cab, said and did embarrassing things in front of new friends (even though they insist it was all funny and I wasn’t over the top I can’t stop obsessing about what I said and did, or may have done). I fell asleep in the cab on the way home and that’s so dangerous. My husband was up till 4am worrying about me.

I feel like the worst person in the world. The feeling I after I wake up is the most intense self hatred, anxiety, and shame. 

I grew up in the evangelical church, got married as a virgin, and when I finally got to college away from my parents and church and had my first sip of alcohol at 20 (which turned into 6 glasses and the first time I ever drank and I cheated that same night) it was the thing I needed to finally do what I wanted to do (not be married, break free from the church). But I had so much shame around breaking away that I partied hard after that to deal with the anxiety and to be able to have the courage to do all the things I had never done before (go to parties, hang out with new types of people, have casual sex). Now when I’m hungover I remember all the shame of those days when I would wake up knowing I was a cheater and I was going to lose all my friends and everyone was going to hate me for getting divorced, leaving the church, and drinking. 

I also have anxiety and depression and hangovers just make my anxiety SO terrible, sometimes for days. That with the shame is so, so, so bad. 

I will say that for every 1 awful binge night/ 
hangover I have 150 “normal” alcohol experiences that I mostly enjoy with very minimal consequences. 

But I’m at the point in my life where I finally think I love myself enough to never want to have a terrible hangover again. But I think the only way to guarantee that is to not drink al all. Because I’ve told myself many times 3 drinks is my max and then after a long time of maintaining (like a year) I lose my connection to why that limit is important and I think “oh I can have more this time/it will be fine”.

Also I feel like alcohol helps me access the parts of myself that I have trouble with from all the religious shame, like having sex, giving it my all when performing on stage, making new friends, etc. I’m afraid if I don’t drink I will be stunted for life, but I’m afraid if I keep binging I will fuck up my life and lose everything important to me.

What do you think? Is it better to quit than to try sticking to the 3-drink limit again? Can anyone relate to the intense shame and anxiety? I’m still feeling it and I want it to stop 😓

Anyway today I got yet more bad news on my health, in spite of my best efforts to improve things.  It's really frustrating.

I found this group almost a month ago and I wish I would have found it sooner. It has been such a great help to me to read other people’s stories because it turns out that my dark alcohol demons have been visiting other people as well.

I am 100 days sober today for the first time in 14 years. I was only sober 14 years ago because I was pregnant. Before pregnancy, I was a daily drinker for 5 years. I live in a city that promotes drinking every day, for every event, for every holiday, for every meal. It is just the way of life here for most people and I happily jumped right into that lifestyle as soon as I could. I started out having beers with friends while partying on the weekends, but weekends became weekdays and life was just a constant party. It was all in the name of fun because I was young and free and having the time of my life. After getting married we decided to have a child and that was my first sober adult life experience. It was good. I stopped drinking the day I found out I was pregnant and never craved it during my pregnancy. Once I had my son I wanted to drink again, not because I was craving alcohol, but because I thought it was not a big deal to drink (even though I was telling myself “don’t let yourself drink like you did before” so obviously I KNEW I had a problem already). It did not take long for me to start drinking in excess again. I would easily drink 10 -12 beers a night after work and more on the weekends. I am a Drink Until All The Alcohol Is Gone or you pass out alcoholic. For the last 10 years wine has been my drink of choice and I was drinking 2 to 3 bottles of wine a night and on weekends I’d add in a few beers during the day. 

I felt horrible all the time. My body felt like it was starting to give out on me. I did not know what to do and how to get help. My husband drinks, but he is not an alcoholic. He knew how much I was drinking, but in his mind, everything was ok because I was one of the best functioning alcoholics you would ever meet. I have had a great job in a high position for almost 2 decades, I’ve been a super mom and wife and I have always had a dominant personality that shows no weakness. He didn’t know the demons I was fighting inside every day. He didn't know how many days I thought I was dying. NO ONE knew. I told my husband that I was going to quit drinking (again, because I have tried and failed after a few days many times before) and he supported me. It has been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. It’s still the hardest thing I do every day. I still think about drinking all the time. I dream about drinking. The longer I am sober the more my mind starts telling me that I will be able to drink again one day like other people do. I even hide that I’m NOT drinking when I’m around friends and family. I’ll either have a Yeti cup in my hand that I use to drink wine out of, or I’ll have a zero alcohol bottle of “beer” in a cooze, so that no one asks me why I’m not drinking. I don’t know why I am ashamed to tell people that I am choosing not to drink anymore, but it is something I’ll work on.

I would have at least 6 beers a day, 7 days a week, and about 3 days out of the week I would get blackout drunk.  I would convince myself I didn't have a problem ""I'm just having some day drinks. I'm just taking the edge off of work. I'm just calming my nerves from Covid. It's not like I have to be anywhere."". I lied to myself saying there is no way I'm turning into an alcoholic....

The drinking slowly began to start early in the day. Some days by 10am I was cracking a beer open, ""I'm just having some day drinks like I would if I could go on vacation."" Is how I tried to justify it. By 3 o'clock I would be passed out and having a ton of work emails to answer because I was too drunk to do them earlier. I googled ""what is considered an alcoholic"" and ready through some articles, which summed me up pretty well. I would brush it off and go ""nooo not me, I don't have a problem"". 

Eventually I noticed my work slipping and it starting to cause a problem. My moods would depend on how bad I felt when I woke up. I had no interest in doing anything besides cracking the first beer of the day open. I googled ""what is considered an alcoholic"" again. I started to realize that I had an issue with alcohol and needed to come to terms with it. 

In my attempts to deal with my drinking I would stop for a couple days (my longest was 2.5 weeks)....then end up buying beer and starting all over. 

I found this subreddit and it helped knowing I wasn't the only one and read stories just like mine. So why am I posting today? Well, my urges almost got the better of me today. I wanted a drink and I got in my car and drove to the gas station that I always bought beer from. I walked inside and entered the beer cooler and just stood there. I stood there an just was ashamed of myself, the voice in my head telling me ""there is nothing good going to come from buying beer and drinking"". I listened to that voice...I walked out the beer cooler bought some chips and a read bull. 

No one in my family/friend group has any idea I struggle with alcohol Thankfully this subreddit exist so I can share and get this off my chest. I'm going to just take is one small step at a time to do my best in staying sober.

I've been binge drinking ever since I discovered alcohol at the age of 15 (14 years ago-christ that's a long time)

I used to drink to loosen me up and have fun. I've had real struggles with social anxiety my whole life. And as time went on the excuses I made to myself to drink increased to the point where I am now. I drink every morning before work and every evening until my fiance gets home.

I've become so sneaky. I'm an expert at hiding cans all over the place where they won't be found and lieing to my fiance. She's caught me in the past and trust in our relationship is paper thin.

Up to now I considered myself to be ""highly functional"" but today I called in sick to work just so I could drink all day and I've come to the realisation that I've lied to myself as well. I knew this wasn't true but it really hit me today.

I think I've got the building blocks I need to quit drinking but any encouragement or words of wisdom would be appreciated. I also think saying (typing) this might help. I don't want to be a sneaky liar anymore.",28,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7543294}"

I'm sitting at about 2 months sober (or whatever my badge says) but I'm still finding myself super tired during the day. I'm not sure if I just need to get eat better (taking b vitamins every day), go to the doctors or if it's something that will get better with time. I seem to be getting enough sleep (at least 7 hours in a night) and I wake up feeling generally refreshed. However, it takes maybe 2 hours for me to start to yawn and feel the fatigue. I've been taking lunch break naps to get through the day. Now, I slept like garbage for the first several weeks after quitting so maybe it's long term sleep deficits I'm catching up on? But, if I was able I could easily sleep most of the day away at this point. I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and how long it took to get better or if I should be more concerned.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47505856}"

I have a couple of friends here who I've met occasionally and it's helped. I also speak to my parents weekly on the phone. Anyway, I've noticed that my alcohol use has increased steadily over the year, especially more recently this year when I stopped smoking. Together with my mental state I feel that it's not a good idea to be drinking at the moment.

This was confirmed this weekend. I basically started drinking at 8pm at night, then through to the next morning. I was completely wasted and to be honest out of control with how I was feeling (mostly angry and confused), out of frustration at the lockdown and being on my own. So, I decided to hit the store at 10am when they opened to get some more beer / wine.

What followed was an embarassing kind of black out sequence of events; I was basically swearing at people / traffic in the street near where I live, laughing at people in the store, one couple especially in the street I was VERY rude to and continued to shout something at them as they walked away, and was laughing out loud at them.

I then went home, had what must be a 1 hour plus argument with my smoke alram (which I was convinced had a camera watching me in - paranoia!) and put my music on loud and I think may have upset my neighbours.

It's now a few days later and I'm still struggling with my actions, I don't even want to leave the house. I don't know the people involved so I can't apologise to them, I wouldn't even recognise them again. Which makes me even more paranoid to step outside.

Also, someone rang my buzzer the next day, now I'm super paranoid incase it was the police or my neighbours / or may the people I insulted. I was too wasted to get up and answer the door to them.

Erghhh I just found this forum and thought it might help me to post this here. If anyone has any advice / words that might make me feel better for my dumb actions then I would welcome them.

For example, I told my kid we'd need to go out and pay some bills, and she said she thought my hubs did it last night. My first thought, ""Yeah right, he hasn't written a check in 14 years."" Don't get me wrong, if I ask for help, I get it. It's just frustrating to have to ask.

I assume mostly because I was totally bloated and carrying a ton of water weight. After that initial loss, my weight leveled off for the rest of those first 6 months. During that time, I allowed myself to eat whatever I wanted, even if that meant 1/2 bag of chips, handfuls of peanuts followed by a bowl of ice cream, ALL after dinner, in an effort to not be tempted to pour that glass of bourbon!
Finally, just past my 6 month mark, I decided to make changes to my eating habits and hold myself accountable to more healthy eating. I am not depriving myself of things like pizza or the occasional cookie, but mostly just cutting out the junk and replacing it with fruit. 
Now about 10 weeks into eating better and the pounds are dropping faster than I ever imagined they would!  
I am now down about 40 pounds total and 30ish in the last 10-11 weeks. 
I have to say, I feel really good, physically and mentally, about continuing to transform myself into who I want to be. 
For those reading this, I am a 47 year old man with a wife and 2 teenage boys.

It wasn't easy at first, but it did get better, much better. I'm looking forward to another year of sobriety, and then to more beyond that.

&#x200B;

I started drinking in my mid teens. At first I drank to fit in, then because it was the young person's party culture, then because I was bored, and then eventually I drank because I couldn't stop.

&#x200B;

It took many things from me and I pretended that it didn't. I missed out on friendships and lost friendships because of it. I formed unhealthy friendships to enable my habit. I missed out on opportunities to better myself. It hurt my family and I wasn't as good of an employee as I could have been. I lied to myself that somehow drinking made me a better person and made my life more interesting, it did not.

&#x200B;

About 12 years go I started to try to moderate myself. I stopped drinking every night. But then I just binged harder on the weekend. I'd feel that right through to Thursday, and usually I'd end up drinking before then anyway.

&#x200B;

Eventually I decided to try to quit altogether. It took years. I'd go for a couple of weeks without a drink, then come back to it. Then try for a longer period of time. It was hard. I'd find myself driving out to the liquor store and parking in front of it, then driving home. Then driving back and eventually buying some booze.

&#x200B;

At one point, prior to the Christmas of 2019 I made it 5 weeks without a drink. That was an accomplishment. But holidays have always been a trigger for me. I decided to have a few drinks and then do another five weeks. I binged right through Christmas and beyond. It was difficult to even do two weeks after that. Then Covid-19 hit. At first I started to binge a lot, as per usual.

&#x200B;

But then I thought, why not try something different in this unusual time. So I put some effort into it, starting on April 20, 2020, and I went for another five week stretch. And during that stretch I decided, why not just keep going. Why stop. And so I haven't. And I hope I don't.

&#x200B;

I want to thank everybody on this subreddit for their posts. I've been reading them for some time and they've helped. At first they helped me get out to the two week mark without alcohol, then to more weeks, until five, and then until now. I'd think about this subreddit sometimes while I was struggling. It helped. Ultimately the strength to quit had to come from me, but sometimes when I was teetering on the edge, this place helped me make the right decision.

&#x200B;

I also realize from this subreddit that I'm not done because I've quit. I'll have to remain vigilant. I've encountered a lot of trigger points, such as holidays and work events, that I've had to be careful with. And that even years from now I can still potentially stumble.

Walmart no longer has these items listed on Instacart and Amazon is charging you up the ass for this stuff. However, ALCOHOL is still being sold and considered essential. 

I’m trying to keep myself busy by cooking, painting, etc. to keep my mind off drinking yet you can’t even buy basic items, but you can buy booze. I love the provincial government’s thinking. It like totally makes sense.

By the time I type something out I feel embarrassed that I'm over sharing or just generally feel emotionally vulnerable, so I just end up deleting the whole thing. I'm the type to bottle up my emotions, but I know right now it's not healthy and I need to let the pressure out.

I've been reading posts about us being VIP customers at our local shops.  I was one too.

I have 2 liquor stores near me and I used to rotate between them to get my booze.  In the morning I'd get a 6pack from one of them, at lunch I would go to the opposite one and later in the evening I get my hard liquor from the first one again.  I didn't want them to think I was a wasteoid.  At some point I completely gave up on the charade and started going to the same store, the one closest, for all my booze shopping.  I didn't care that they saw me as an alcoholic.

So I would be in there at 9am getting booze, at noon getting booze and maybe some sort of food item.  Then i'll be back at 4 or 5 making it look like I need some cooking supplies, some olive oil some ketchup and of course more booze!  Luckily, I thought, they had more than one cashier, so it wasn't the same person checking me out.

I was a bit obsessive with what I drank, if I tried out some new beer and I liked it, I would just drink that beer for months.  So I would quickly deplete the stock of any beer the store had, they would make  mid week re-stocking requests from their suppliers.  I was their VIP customer.   They would let me know when they only have 1 case left of what I was buying and I would proudly announce that I'm coming back to get it later tonight.

If they had some rare brews in stock, I would urge them to get more from the supplier because I'll buy them all.  So right now, they have 3 or 4 cases of Pliny the Elder that they ordered on my request.

I've been going there everyday the past week, but only to buy ginger beer and blueberries.  I don't know if they can tell that I'm not drunk anymore.  I hope they can.

I want to tell him I have a real plan this time. Meds, therapy, Annie grace’s 30 day alcohol experiment, just to start. It’s more of a plan than I’ve ever had before and now that I’ve been smacked in the face with reality he may leave, I’ll do anything to be better for both of us. 

I can’t eat, sleep or think straight at all. The brain fog is strong and anxiety makes me so much worse and forgetful. We also work together, so I know I won’t hear from him till after the work day regardless. 

I’m trying not to beat myself up about it but honestly I just feel so worthless and stupid and selfish, which makes me feel worse because I know it frustrates him when I get really self deprecating (which nowadays usually only happens while drinking, but sometimes while sober too) and then I feel those emotions even MORE for putting him the struggle with me.

I just wanted to thank this community for those who shared their stories. Your courage  helped me and probably others on our journey of sobriety.

Three short but big take aways that I wanted to share for anyone reading and thinking they should/want to get sober.

1.) Take it day by day. This community is the best to remind you that it's not working toward a 14 day goal but simply I will not drink with you TODAY. Love that motto.

2.) Life is indescribably better. These last two weeks have had highs and lows, but I am starting to enjoy the feeling of being low and the highs feel 1000x better. Allow yourself to feel the moment and live there. Even if your craving, try to feel and understand.  Easier said then done of course...but YOU can do it.

3.) Anyone that is intimated by the large count of days of sobriety on this page. Read the post, some of the 100 days, 2 year stories speak volumes of knowledge toward not drinking. Also, their journey started from 1 day of not drinking then to 2 days and it just kept moving.

I hope this helps anyone who's reading this, whether you're drunk right now, hungover, or sober.

I thought I would share a couple of aids that have really helped me with sobriety. I have found the hardest part of not drinking has been giving up my psychological dependence on alcohol. I used it as a social crutch and have strong associations we alcohol and fun coming from a family of heavy drinkers. 

The 1st may not be for everyone but magic mushrooms have been an enormous help. For me, it breaks down my habitual routines, and by deconstructing I have been able to rebuild myself without the need for alcohol to be a part of my core identity. I came across this watching the movie fantastic fungi. I strongly recommended it to everyone. The movie says that Psilocybin has proven to be the single most effective treatment for alcoholism. From my own experience, I completely agree.

[https://fantasticfungi.com/](https://fantasticfungi.com/)

The 2nd is a product called  Cherry lane. It is a sour cherry concentrate that really hits the same notes as a glass of red wine. It looks the same and is perfect for social settings. It is also healthy and amazing for hangovers if you slip up.

I'm doing okay, which is often when I need this place the most. I've caught myself a few times this week wondering if maybe just one wouldn't hurt. If you're here too, perhaps you know the feeling.


A post I saw earlier got me thinking about the times I didn't have this community and the times other people had an unexpected (but ultimately positive) effect on my mindset. Things got out of my control at a time in my life when I was very isolated, and I always wonder where those people are now or if they know what they were able to give me with a few words that probably meant very little to them. 


For me it was a woman at the supermarket (much like the post I saw earlier). I was a regular, and I liked this shop - it had a self checkout, and towards the end of the evening most of the staff were teenagers who just wanted to go home. No one would notice if I was already a little drunk and shuffling in for round two (or that's what I told myself). On this occasion, though, it was my first stop of the night, around 7pm. I wasn't really eating a lot at the time and I don't know what made me go to the in-person checkout rather than the machines. My purchases were one bread roll and the largest bottle of the cheapest vodka they had. 


When I set them down, the cashier looked at them, looked at me, and she gave me this really warm, gentle smile. All she said was, ""I really hope you're having more than this for your dinner, love.""


And of course I wasn't. In hindsight, it was obvious I wasn't. But she wasn't judgemental or mocking, she just planted that seed very gently in my head that I wasn't taking care of myself right. Maybe it was just an offhand comment, but I think of her often, and hope she's well. I kept on down that route quite a while longer, but every time I had a very depressing 'dinner' of that kind, I thought of her. Not always, but sometimes it was enough to make me ease up a little.

2020 was the first sober year I had since I started drinking 20+ years ago. I am really happy about it. I will be ~2 years sober. I was helped by the fact that I was surrounded by family the whole time during the pandemic. bars were closed. Here in nyc, it got really bad right away so things were super hectic. Even the rare times we ventured out, I didn’t see people hangin out and having fun while drinking.

But now everything is going back to normal. I don’t want drinking to go back to the way it was, for me. I feel panicked sometimes even thinking about that. Fucks sake all day,  I would just be steeped in misery. Instead now, I do all sorts of fun stuff during my day. I actually do the things drunk me would promise myself I would do. I like this life, I like living.

I was sober for a while before the pandemic too. I had reached a good place. So I know I have it in me to stay sober. I also have my ant abuse. I have you guys!

I just don’t want to slip, not even once. I am so happy and proud and relieved  of my sobriety. I am so scared of relapsing. I really really don’t want to have a “moment of weakness” and sip on a beer because “fuck it, pandemic is over” I don’t want to have a glass of wine because it was a long day. I don’t want to say yes when I will invariably be offered booze during a work dinner. I don’t want to convince myself that “I can have one, no one will know”.

I don’t want any of that, I just want to be stuck in this place I’m in right now.

I saw a guy drinking a beer at one of my old favorite pubs and I thought “that used to be me!” And it was a relatively happy thought, which I did not like. That was me, yes, but inside I was burning with fear and anxiety and desperation. I need to remember that. Not just “sitting outside drinking a beer”... the reality for me was that I was fucking miserable when I was drinking that beer. 

not even one sliver of me felt any of the joy or pride I feel today.

I am actively thinking about these situations to make sure I don’t fall for any traps my brain is sure to set for me. I have talked to my wife about this, she will check in with me and make sure to see me take my ant abuse.

I am just so scared of fucking up. I know I will be careful, but drinking was so out of my control for years, it feels really scary that I’ll be back out there again.",34,{'pandemic': 3},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.37727848}"

Some nights when drink a whole bottle of wine while chilling on the couch with my boyfriend, watching Netflix, I would turn to him, with my eyes wide, and start saying crazy gibberish, like I’m possessed (that’s how he would describe it). Then I turn over and pass out, not a memory of any of this. 

One time I turned my head to him, eyes wide open, and told him that I’m going to kill him THEN slit his throat. After I said this I passed out. Didn’t remember any of this the next day and felt so embarrassed and guilty. I love true crime, but that’s taking it too far! 

Just the other night he said that I was passed out and starting to trying to jab my elbow into him. Alcohol causes such bizarre behavior. 

I started to use a sleep app several months ago, wh I had a nighttime recorder in it. Only when I drink, I have recordings of myself singing, talking gibberish and sometimes putting together whole sentences that make perfect sense. I also snore like crazy! When I don’t drink, complete silence.

My boyfriend is so wonderful and understanding and doesn’t want to cause any conflict with me (I always get offended when he brings up my drinking, so he just avoids it), so why am I doing this to him?

On my nights I'd be cranky, because I couldn't drink beforehand, I knew I'd have 3 or 4 there, and that already put me close to the limit, or over. Some nights I'd grab a beer for the road, pull over near our house to slam it down and throw the bottle out the window. Crack open the whiskey when I pulled in.

Turns out two cokes is a lot cheaper than 4 beers, we won trivia, and I drove home through town instead of taking the bumpy back road to avoid the cops.

Little context, I am a man, 22 year, still a student but I work part-time. I  wouldn't say I am an addict but drinking clearly has negative impact on  my life. I drink occasionally, maybe once in a month, but when I do I  often lose all barriers and drink more than my body can handle, which  results in behaving in a way I am then ashamed of.

I  know it might appear too spontaneous only 1 day after I got drunk, but  as I said I was thinking about it even before, and I mean it 100 %.

And  I know I can do it. This is not an ambition I'm hoping will come true.  This is a plan I am sure I will go by. Similar thing happened with  another thing that was ruining me - porn. I decided I will not watch it  again and I kept to that promise for more than a year now. (I recommend  it btw.)

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I think that one's from Laura McKowen's book, We Are The Luckiest, but my first sobriety journal feels like a series of scribbles on the walls of a cave. Anything that made sense to me was jotted down, illegibly at times, and at times without proper attribution. Quotes from books, something someone said at a meeting, some wisdom from fellow sobernauts here, a caption on Instagram, and so many book recommendations I will never have time for.

While I am still in early sobriety, that first journal is the one where I was still in purgatory, looking for the third door - a way that wasn't heavy drinking or complete abstinence. Nothing truly horrible happened from my drinking (YET), so maybe there was a special solution to my special situation - what in AA I think they call ""terminal uniqueness"". Part of my hesitancy was grief - grieving for all those breezy patio days in which I had one drink (not that they had ever happened before),  the weddings where I had a normal amount instead of being the last one to go to bed at the reception - a whole mythical life in which I drank like a normal person. I had to admit that it wasn't working. It wasn't fair. It was sad. I did have good times drinking, they were just rare, and it was sad to give them up.

But once I committed and my brain stopped desperately looking for an off-ramp of sobriety, it did get easier. I allowed and accepted sweetness into my life. My senses that had been so dulled by drinking got brighter and brighter and little joys are what I live for now. IWNDWYT.",157,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5443054}"

2021-04-20 05:05:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mumajs/an_offhand_comment_from_a_supermarket_worker/,An offhand comment from a supermarket worker brought me out of years of denial,"Disclaimer: sorry this is a long one. TLDR at the bottom.

I was at the supermarket (grocery store) tonight and was scanning my bottle of wine and pack of sushi at the self-checkout. I do this basically every night on my way home from the gym. The workers all kind of know me since I'm always there, and are very friendly.

Tonight, the woman who checked my ID joked 'you're always here at night buying the wine aren't you!'. I laughed it off and started blushing with total embarrassment. My first thought when I got to the car was 'Im going to have to start a rotation of visiting different stores, so it's not this obvious'. Then I realized, 'shit, this isn't normal'. 

My drinking habits have ebbed and flowed over time. From binge drinking 5 nights a week in university, to being a social recluse for a few years and drinking alone. I'm more social these days, but my drinking has escalated in the past year. 

I drink a bottle of wine every night, without fail. On weekends it's more like 2 bottles a night. I've tried to resist buying alcohol at night, but it gets to about 8pm and I have this restless feeling, like an itch than only alcohol can get rid off. The urge is usually worse when I'm feeling lonely. I'm drinking a bottle of wine as I type this.

I don't think friends/family suspect a thing, because I hide it pretty well. I don't get hungover and I'm very fit/active. I'm fully functional at work, and it's a job that requires a lot of responsibility. I've also been told by friends that I seem sober when I'm drunk, which I suspect is due to tolerance. When I'm staying at my parents house, I hide bottles in my room and then take them to the recycling centre when my parents are out. If I had to guess, I'd say I may be a functional alcoholic.

But I'm well aware that functional alcoholics don't always stay functional. The issues caused from drinking are subtle, but they are there. My finances aren't as good as they should be, and I started seeing a few Sugar Daddies to get them back to a reasonable state. I feel constantly guilty for living a double life (both with the drinking and sleeping with rich men for money). 

TLDR:

I also have realized that this is because I have never had boundaries. I grew up in an abusive household, with a highly narcissistic mother, and I was punished for saying no. I'm terrified of doing it, but I'm realizing that I will have to learn to do it now that I'm in recovery, or I will not be able to get well. 

A few days ago, a longtime friend I'd deliberately not talked to in months and who is often pressure-y, verbally abusive, etc. with me, but also can be very helpful, loyal and kind, called me late at night, angry and drunk, saying ""how dare you not fucking respond to me. Don't you dare do this"". Today I sent him a message reminding him that I am sober and asking that he not leave me drunk, angry messages because they were unsettling to me. He responded with ""Ok sure I won't, but I've been worried sick about you for a year, it's all I can think about, so you know, that wasn't anger, it was love"". 

Here's the thing: he's a very old friend, perhaps my oldest in this city. He's set me up with my current therapist, and he has been there for me when no one else has. That said, he's very aggressive and I don't think I can hold the boundary with him if we meet in person. We only live like half a mile from each other, but is it ok that I not meet with him in person or engage in long conversations with him until I'm a bit better about holding my boundary? I recognize that I may ultimately lose the relationship, but for now I just want to protect my growth and recovery.

I’ve been aware I’ve had a problem for awhile and told myself to cut back and done so, only to be lured back by the idea I could be a casual drinker as a couple of beers couldn’t hurt. After all, everyone is out in the beer gardens now in the UK and it’s a perfectly normal thing to engage in a bit of social drinking. But it quickly escalates from those few innocent beers in the garden to buying a full bottle of whiskey on the way home from work because a half bottle might not be enough despite it being a weekday

But I’m tired of it now. I’m tired of the alarm going off in the morning and the gloom of shame that immediately descends over me. I’m tired of my inner monologue telling me what a waster I am in the morning and then that same voice telling me it’s time to drink in the evenings and being so powerless to resist. I’ve vomited bile in the mornings, I’ve had the withdrawals and the anxiety so bad I can’t sit still. My family and colleagues can see by my bloated, red face that somethings not right. I’m tired of the aches and pains that are so present when I’m hungover but miraculously disappear when I don’t put poison in my body for a few days

But most of all I’m tired of the shame when I look at my wife and daughter and know I may be depriving them of a loving father and husband if I continue

So, I am with you guys. I don’t know what to expect going forward but I know it can only be a lot better than what is now and has been for a while. We live in a world that normalises drinking and it’s everywhere we look. I have to deal with that mentally and find peace with it and myself. I must remember that I want to be that person up early, bright eyed, enjoying a coffee and the morning sun - not the person who gets up still drunk and takes a shot just to settle

I’m on a new journey now and I will look to this sub for support and become more active myself to support others. My first post here and badge request WILL become the turning point in my mission to finally remove this poison from my life

My last time drinking drinking was March 7, 2020. I got blackout drunk, don’t remember anything, fell on my face at the bar and cut my head open. I woke up the next day with so much shame and regret and wanted to die. This was a recurring theme in my life. Especially since after having kids I would be sober for a time then get blackout and have to deal with the fall out. The weeks after a blackout I would drag my self out of the hole. When I did I felt victorious, I would think wow good for me I just felt so shitty and survived. I guess it’s now time to drink.

The last time I got drunk March 2020, right after that the world shut down. So the whole pandemic other than a couple drinks I have not got blackout drunk. Surviving the pandemic made me feel like I was accomplishing something. Feeling scared all the time and dealing with it felt familiar. 

Soon things will start getting better. People will be vaccinated life will get a lot easier and I will be sober. I think life will feel too easy? I’m starting to think I drank because I love the messed it made. Feeling shitty and scared is so familiar to me. Sometimes I don’t know what to do when things are going well.

I realize that alcoholism is a serious disease, but I feel like he’s using his “alcoholism” to deflect any blame for his action.

My theory is that he doesn’t know how to cope with work stress and uses alcohol to self medicate. Both times, he was binge drinking behind my back for a span of 2 weeks before he got caught. He went to AA and stopped drinking for 6 months then started drinking again casually for 2 years with absolutely no issue. When he’s drinking, he can have one and stop at one. Splitting a bottle of wine for dinner and not finishing the bottle is ok. Sometimes, he falls asleep before finishing a beer. He can also have 4 and stop at 4. That doesn’t sound like physical dependency to me. However, when work gets stressful, he would go on a bing, relatively speaking. He would go buy liquor from a store and take 4 shots. The 2 binges I know of lasted 2 weeks before he got caught/came clean. Also, the backdrop for both times he binge drank is identical (major project deadline, boss yelled at him, friction at home).

Am I the asshole for thinking that he’s using the term alcoholism to deflect all the shitty thing he’s done to me? He has major issues with accountability, and now he’s assigned all the shitty thing he’s done on alcoholism and how I don’t understand the disease. Can you really be an alcoholic (the medical condition) when 3 weeks ago (prior to work stress), he would be content with splitting half a beer with me? It’s clear that work stress triggers his alcohol abuse, but it feels very situational and is not supported by the clinical term of alcoholism.",4,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7706628}"

Today is sober day two for me and I’m finally felling more of myself today. This is more of an accountability post and just some of my thoughts at this point in my life. I was about two weeks sober but I recently went on a 4 day bender and made some very questionable decisions. I’ve been in and out of getting sober for about 8 years now. It started when I was 19 after getting a minor in possession charge and subsequently getting a dui as soon as I was done with the probation for the MIP. I’ve managed to stay out of trouble for 8 years by some grace of god. 

I’ve spent the last eight years perfecting the art of a being a functioning alcoholic. I managed to graduate college and grad school and even fell into a nice career that I enjoy. I managed to buy a nice car and a nice condo. I’ve always told myself I’d quit drinking once I hit these milestones but I’ve never seemed to kick the habit. Ive never been married and have only been in one serious relationship because I’m always too drunk to meet anyone. I have severe social anxiety and I’ve always said the booze made me more outgoing but it’s only ever made me an asshole. I make a fool out of myself when I black out which happens every time I go out.

I'll be covering B+M Tuesdays for a while.  I'd like to thank /u/BelindaTheGreat for her service to the community in hosting this weekly post so well for so long!  I've got some big shoes to fill.

Real quick about me.  I drank for 15 years in ever increasing amounts until I discovered myself drinking about 500mL every day and not being able to stop.  I googled ""how to stop drinking"", found this subreddit, discovered 100s of thousands of like-minded people here, and, through the love and compassion this community exudes, I was able to find enough compassion for myself to unchain myself from the bottle and find sobriety.  I've been working on my recovery ever since then and I credit SD for saving my life.  So, I do what I can around here to give back.

Now, if I understand correctly, which I rarely do these days, B+M Tuesday has its traditions in discussing ""Quit Lit"" and other sobriety-related media.   To be honest, I read _This Naked Mind_ by Annie Grace, found it very insightful, but ultimately figured it was insufficient to keep me sober, and moved on to literature based on my preferred recovery program.  So, I don't have a lot of quit lit to discuss.

That said, I think about my sobriety _a lot_.  And when I'm watching shows or reading books, I find myself relating the characters and their stories to my experiences both before and after sobriety.

Case in point: my wife and I _just_ started watching Rick and Morty (no spoilers please, and yes, I know I'm way behind).  I like the show and I can totally suspend my disbelief in regards to the time travel, the fanciful inventions, the implausible science, and everything else.  But here's where I get hung up: Rick is _soooooo_ productive and ambitious and active, but _he drinks all the time_.  Nope.  Not real.  Can't relate.  Every time he takes a swig from that (somehow always full) flask and then types something into his keyboard, I cringe.

That was _not_ my experience drinking.  One hit off that flask and, well, I'd be more interested in finishing that flask than, I dunno, opening a portal to another dimension.  Secondly, after I quickly emptied that flask, I'd be pretty worthless in the thinking department.  I like to think I' a smart guy, but my intelligence, ambition, and precision go _waaaay_ down when I start drinking.  I loathed to have a working lunch where we had drinks because 1) I'd have to moderate my drinking and 2) even one or two drinky poos make me useless for any significant work at a keyboard.  

Oh, and the only reason I'd try to open a portal to another dimension after drinking that flask would be to find _more booze_.  My brain pretty much devotes any remaining brain cells it can to finding and consuming drinks once I start drinking.

So, when Rick takes a belt from his flask, clearly to show he's alcoholic, I feel like ""huh, he's not scouring cupboards for more booze after that?  How is he able to _care_ about this experiment at this point?""

It just reminds me what a terrible position I get myself into when I start to drink.  I wouldn't be doing science or experiments.  I'd be looking to refill my flask and then emptying it again just so I could refill it until I was blacking and passing out.",28,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4481803}"

The 13 years between the 2.5 years and 11 months? Maybe 5 months, tops. So, not really a “quit” is it??

But I can’t stop anymore, and honestly the desire to really Quit and be Sober went away a couple years ago too. It feels way too hard and scary and complicated. This shit is PROGRESSIVE. It does not. Get. Easier. 

I have a new therapist for the last few months and I’m learning to love and trust her. I had a minor meltdown last week because I’d been pushing myself too hard - drinking, not sleeping, socializing, not setting boundaries, making sure everyone else was ok except ME and using caffeine and pharmaceutical-grade amphetamines to just make it work. I took a day off work.  I sheltered in place (ha - as in, sheltered myself in bed) and took care of myself for three whole days and then I was craving a drink and it was all I could think about so Saturday I convinced myself and my SO that I was fine and we had drinks. And then I went out Sunday while he was golfing and got to see all my favorite people and only friends - the ones I’ve known for 11+ years since I started bartending who are regulars at my bar. Talked to my therapist today and she said, “hey, obviously the drinking is doing something for you. Drinking and connection with people are linked very strongly in your brain. You have to stop being so hard on yourself and we’ll figure out a way to add connection in other ways but if you cut out the drinking, you cut out another huge part of your life too, so it’s not going to be easy” She isn’t minimizing the drinking problem. She knows I hate it. We’ve explored why I want to quit and how we’ll get me to stop. But today after work (I have a day job now and only bartend a couple Saturdays a month) I just wanted to drink. I just want to drink. 

I’m sad and stuck. I used to be the “fit” girl. I could bartend until 2AM, go to bed at 4:00 and get out of bed at 11:00 to make a CrossFit class at noon. Sometimes hungover AF, but I would push myself through it.

Then I got the day job and it got harder. And I’m getting older. And my body tells me it needs rest instead of a workout and I can’t ignore it like I used to. Yes, I’m getting older. No, I will not have the same body I did when I was running around behind a bar full time and was 5 years younger. Now I sit in front of a computer full time and the fatty, greasy, hangover food just settles on my thighs and ass and stomach now instead of being burned off by the constant movement. It was easy to be fit then. It was easy because it was a habit and a schedule that worked for me. 

One of my biggest reasons I want to quit drinking is fucking vanity. Gross, right? Lame. I have LOTS of cancer in my family and vodka and whiskey are just increasing my chances I’ll end up like 3 of my 4 grandparents - getting and dying of cancer before I’m 65. But shallow, ol’ me just hates how my body looks and feels and that my shorts don’t fit, the stupid amount of bikinis I own don’t fit, my arms jiggle, and “is that really what my face looks like?” in pictures.

I really like my new therapist more than I have any of the few I’ve tried since my all-time fav one (that I parted ways with because we both agreed I needed something different). But it hit me today that I have to make a change. I have to do a thing and commit to it. And deal with all the stupid discomfort of craving something and not letting myself have it. Foregoing the god damn instant gratification. She can help, but *i* have to do it. I have to do the thing.

So my SO went out tonight for his Monday-night bowling and I continued to drink. (Glad he was gone so I could break out the liquor instead of sticking with the seltzers I’d been drinking since 5:00) And I was out back on our patio wasting my life on Instagram Reelz (closest I’ll let myself get to Tiktok and it’s pretty damn bad) and I got a text from a girl I used to bartend with. I have a complicated relationship with this one. I love her. She is giving and kind and sweet and thoughtful, but sometimes it’s hard to stay in touch with her. Most of that is a different story, but the big thing is that I’m jealous of her. She could drink and get dumb like the rest of us, but she could also stop. Also, she got fit AS FUCK. We are completely different body types (completely) but I hated it that she could stick to a diet while I would want to bake cookies and cakes and eat half the batter before I even took them to share with anyone else. AND I would bring her some and she would politely decline. Fucking bitch how dare you. But not really. I know. I’m just jealous and being unreasonable.

She texts me tonight while I’m outside drinking some vodka and smoking a cigarette (another awesome thing I’ve picked up on this last year). She says, “hey do you want to do this thing with me?” It’s a fitness ... thing. I wouldn’t say competition because I never saw Spartan Races as competition because while I have always worked out, I never expected to win at shit. And maybe probably that is why she is better at this fitness thing? This girl loves the competition. But  the thing she asked me to do is a workout where they score you, basically. 

This is meaningful. On a lot of levels. 

1. I signed up for a “challenge” with my current exercise-place-program-thing that starts today and if I complete 15 workouts in 5 weeks I get a t-shirt. I had grand plans of after my Sunday funday yesterday and recovering today, I would wake up tomorrow, take some “before” pics in my new bikini and then get this shit in shape. However, here I am drinking so those plans are already falling by the wayside...

2. I need community and connection and one thing I’ve thought about this chick is how easy she has it because she is this extrovert and makes friends easily and I imagine that helped her on her fitness journey because she made friends at her workouts and actually, started doing extra workouts with her trainers. I did CrossFit for 3 years and got comfortable with the ppl in my noon class and a couple of my trainers but never felt like I was an “athlete” or was their friend or “fit in.”

3. She and I have fallen out of touch since we don’t work together anymore (she got FUCKED by our company and more or less fired over some BULLSHIT after working there for 7 years) and I’ve wanted to connect with her but don’t know how without lots of alcohol and because of other things it’s hard for me to be around her sometimes. I know I need connection with people that doesn’t revolve around drinking and I see her as a kind of lifeline 

But can I stop? I thanked her for inviting me to do this event. I told her if I can get in 3 of my workouts towards my other challenge this week I will sign up and do the event in June. But can I? CAN I??!! I don’t feel like I can.

I have been telling myself the last week or so that I need to start telling myself a better story in my head. Like an affirmation, I need to spend time imagining that I CAN do this and how good it will feel and look, but ... that’s as far as I’ve gotten. 

That’s what this shit does to you. It L I E S. When I’m hungover, I’m too sick and sad and anxious and depressed to dream or to hope. Give me a few drinks and all of a sudden I am convinced that tomorrow will be different and tomorrow I will just DO IT. But, it’s fucking BUULLLLLLLSSHHHIIIITTTTTTT. 

It’s the saddest thing that I used to believe and hope and have faith that a sober life was a better life and that was what helped me “quit” all those other times. I had a conviction that, “I’m done with this and my life will be better because of it.” I don’t have that anymore. I don’t know where it went. I love people’s stories. I love hearing even the “life isn’t better but it’s a lot fucking easier without the booze” ones. I believe it. My brain KNOWS that’s true, but I don’t feel it. I don’t feel it hard enough to keep me from drinking again when it’s convenient. 

Can I please stop?

I’ve never had a problem with drinking too often during the week or anything like that which is what I thought in my mind was a drinking problem but I know and I think I’ve known for a long time that I do have a problem I’ve just been too embarrassed to admit it. I don’t know how to drink without getting black out drunk. I watched my own parents do it and I hated seeing them like that and now I have a 2 year old and I thought I was passed this shit but in the last few months the few times I’ve gone out I’ve gotten way too drunk and disrespected my relationship.

It’s hard because I’m Australia drinking seems to be such part of the culture especially being in my twenties it feed so weird to not do it but I don’t even feel that embarrassment I use to worry about in thinking about saying to someone ‘I don’t drink, I’m not good with alcohol, I don’t know when to stop.’ I feel almost freeing in being so honest with myself I guess that’s why I felt like making a post here as it feels like a big deal to me. 

I’m a weird way it makes so much sense, why didn’t I do this sooner? I’ve been arrested multiple times and even ended up in a psych ward, these stemmed from other mental health issues as well but I was always black out drunk during these episodes. Just recently I almost ruined things with the love of my life because I was drunk and acting slutty and I don’t even remember, and it’s not even something I would ever do when I was sober or even with someone I’m attracted to. I know it’s enough now, I can’t let this happen again. I’ll lose people I love and hurt people and it’s so much more simple to just avoid all that by not drinking.

Quick back story, I started drinking when I was 15 and am now 26. My parents are both alcoholics although my mom is now sober. I did not accept I was an alcoholic until last year which was far too late and by that point I was drinking at least 12 beers per day. I was able to get myself sober for 4 months after this realization, but these last few months I fell back in heavy. 

As my title says this last month has been the hardest of my life for two main reasons. First, my girlfriend/fiance of 5 years broke up with me mainly due to trust issues surrounding my alcohol use. I lived with her for the past 3 years and this break up lead to me having to move back in with my parents which has been hard because my dad still does have a lot of alcohol in our house. second, two weeks ago my best friend died unexpectedly and his funeral was this past weekend.

That being said, I've been craving a little bit lately. Partly due to the stress of all the work, partly because COVID is particularly bad where I'm living, and partly because I guess I still feel the need to celebrate with alcohol. I wasn't able to shake the feeling, until my mother gifted me a 12-pack of my ""favorite"" beer to celebrate.

I thought I'd end up drinking it that night. Finishing all 12 in one day, like I normally would have. You wanna know what I did instead? I took that shit out of my place, and regifted it to my good friend (who doesn't struggle with drinking) who's also graduating this week.

Apologies. Wrote it out so I figured I might as well post it, and maybe a patient soul could have some insight.

Howdy. I’ve been sober since december 20th. This is the longest I’ve gone without alcohol since I was 19. It hardly feels like an accomplishment, because if it weren’t for the alcohol monitor permanently strapped to my ankle, I know I would have caved in on a great many occasions.

I’ve got 3 dui’s since 2016. Terrible record I know. I’m a binge drinker and once I get to that point, the voice of reason telling me not to do insanely stupid things is not there. In fact the last two I don’t even remember, so the higher thinking part of my brain wasn’t even functioning at all. I’m still proud that I can at least abstain when immediate incarceration is guaranteed, but it diminishes the accomplishment considerably. In my opinion.

I’ve been on house arrest for three months. I can leave for work and once a week for the grocery. I know it’s much better than jail, but it’s still a heavy burden on my psyche. I am grateful for this outcome, but being isolated and unable to even go outside and feel the sun, or feel a part of this world, is pretty hard on the old “chronic severe depression”. In the last couple weeks I haven’t even had the motivation to stretch and workout. I can at least still clean and bathe when necessary. But life where all you do is work as a drone and come home to sit in four walls is uniquely torturous. The way it makes you feel so hopeless and worthless. Gross.

Anyway I have three months left. I know I can make it, and I know that when my life and time are mine again, everything will feel less bleak. From the inside looking out though it’s a hard perspective. My license is suspended for 10 years. I’m officially the DUI guy. I had a job lined up for when it was over, something less hard on my body and more potential for growth. I told that supervisor my situation and that option is no more.

I’m 27 and I feel like I’ve wasted the last 10 years of my life. I’ve been sober for 4 months and I still feel empty inside. I have no idea what career I want, let alone what career I would even be able to pursue as a habitual felon who can’t drive. I can’t even enjoy my hobbies. I don’t even want to go to work and it’s the only thing that gets me out of this fucking house. I just want to sit perfectly still with my eyes closed and think about nothing.

I had a quick question regarding a very recommended book that I have seen mentioned several times here, ""This Naked Mind"". I started to read it yesterday as I feel like I have fallen into a deep, dark abyss and finding no way out. I am drinking more than I ever have before and decided to purchase Annie Grace's book. I am about 120 pages in and for the first time in a very long time, I see a pinpoint of light in this dark reality I have created for myself. I desperately want to quit drinking. I had approximately 10 years of sobriety until about 4 years ago. 

I tried to reach out for help with my GP; however, the only response I received is that they are not a rehab facility and I should just try to wean myself off of alcohol. I tried tapering; however, I have not been successful. I tried to research outpatient rehab facilities, but I did not agree with the methods of one of them and the other wanted me to commit to at least 2 weeks (out of state) and I cannot do this with my job responsibilities. 

I decided to look at self-help options and finally purchased the Kindle version of ""This Naked Mind"", by Annie Grace. It has made a little impact so far, but I am curious to know if anyone has been able to quit drinking from reading this piece. Also, are there other tools, books, resources you used in order for it to click and to be able to quit drinking?

Thank you in advance!  I really want to get out of this vicious cycle and the darkness and begin living my life again!",31,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43103316}"

All of 2020 was me trying to reckon with my addiction. I tried cold turkey, counseling, rationing/journaling, hypnotherapy and every time I slipped right back into the cycle of alcoholism. It’s a lonely place to be. I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember and the self medicating routine has been making it worse. I started having intense panic attacks and ended up in the ER a couple of weeks ago for tachycardia that lasted for 12 hours. The ER doctor told me that he believed this was symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. I started looking at the blood work yesterday and researched the highs and lows and I’m really terrified about what I found. I need to talk to the doctor about potential kidney damage. 
What has been really strange to me, is that I’ve talked to my primary about assistance with quitting and the whole process has taken so long (they have known about my alcoholism for years, I reached out at the end of 2020 for assistance) It’s been over a month since I decided to take the rehab route, and finally today I was able to book admission for Friday. It was so vulnerable to have to choose the date after thinking that I was going to be there week after week after week, shit got real. My voice was trembling and there was a supportive voice on the other end of the line. I am so grateful that the stars aligned for this to be able to take place. I have proven to myself that I have the courage to quit, I just need someone to help hold my hand when it gets difficult and keep me accountable. My partner and I have been codependent alcoholics for 7 years. We have decided to separate and get sober apart from one another. When I’m released I will not be returning home, but to a room I will rent close to work. Wish me luck for the heartache or better yet, a prospering sober life with my partner. I’m terrified, but hopeful. I can’t wait to be on the other side, sober with all of you. I’ve linger here for a long time and I know it will be one of my safe places I know I can always come to.

Things were bad, and the drinking got worse than ever before.

So I decided, one year from now. Let's see what we can do with it. The line was drawn, it was clean it up now or die young, either my own hand or the drink would take me soon enough, the course I was on. I quit drinking, hit the gym every single day, got employed in my field. Months into it, I was losing weight fast, accruing wealth fast (stock market). Nearing a year of sobriety, I bought my first home. At a year, I was less than half my previous body weight and still sober. It was the hardest and the best year of my life. 

Now, I look back and don't recognize the man that started this journey. The drink changed me, took me away from myself. Now I see clearly, and can proudly say I've done it. I've broken the cycle of addiction in my life for the first time.

My days are filled with joy, strife, challenges, and laughter. A balanced existence, without liquor skewing it. 

I'm the happiest I've ever been, living with my soulmate and our dog, in a home I own. Life is good, and I sure as fuck have fought hard to get here. I know in my heart I'm better now and that this beautiful life I love so dearly is mine to keep, because I've earned it.

I would like to start off by saying this is the first time I have actually seeked help from others (on my own accord) I have had to go to counseling in the past because DUIs. And of course it didn't help because I wasn't ready to quit. And if I'm being completely honest I still don't think I want to. The thought of not having alcohol in my life scares me as ridiculous as it may sound. I'd like to apologize because this will probably be pretty long but I know talking is the best thing I can do right now. So I have struggled with alcohol addiction for probably about 13 years now. If you don't mind I will just start from the beginning of what I considered to be my downward spiral. I think it started when I was 18. I was pregnant I was getting ready to graduate high school and thought I had my whole life ahead of me so I had an abortion and ended up hating myself so I turned to alcohol. I have been in 2 longish relationships one for 5yrs the other for 6yrs. Both involved... You guessed it more booze!! At this point drinking became my routine, hobby and daily ritual. My life up until this point right now has involved me just waiting for my next drink. It didn't matter what happened to me or what I did to my friends and family I refused to quit drinking. I would say things like ""I'll cut back or I'll talk to someone"" and of course I never did. Compared to how much I used to drink I think I have cut back considerably. The problem is now when I drink (almost everyday) I usually slam two or three eight percenters (tall boys)  and get black out drunk and VERY emotional. So I met someone about 2 years ago and they are very good to me. Like worship the ground I walk on and during this time I have treated him like shit. He is so patient and so understanding but I know he's had enough and I'm scared to death to lose him because I'm afraid my drinking would just get worse. I know you can't stop drinking for someone else and that's not the way it works. But this time I want to stop drinking for myself too. Because this life is too awesome not to remember. I've lost so much time,memory and money to alcohol it makes me sick. But for some stupid reason I can't stop obsessing over it.

2021-04-19 17:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mubae9/i_failed_my_first_weekend/,I failed my first weekend,"Hey guys, I was not able to stop myself from drinking this weekend. The silver lining, I guess, is that instead of 15-20 on both Friday and Saturday, I had only 3 on Friday and 5 on Saturday. That is quite a significant cut back which I’m happy about. 

I haven’t spoken about it here before but I have a pretty severe panic disorder and have developed quite a bit of health anxiety ever since my father unexpectedly passed away about two months ago. So I have been googling every little “symptom” I’ve been having and especially researching some that come from drinking. I have been convincing myself that in three weeks I have gone from mild fatty liver to full blown liver failure. 

I actually had a good time on Friday but during Saturday night I felt my feet start to get pins and needles. The feeling got more intense and then my legs started feeling cramped and I was super worried so I laid in bed and tried to go to sleep. Well my feet felt like they were on fire and the pins feeling got even more intense. I was scared and remembered that severe B1 deficiency can result in these symptoms, as well as other symptoms I have noticed these past few weeks, and I ended up going to the ER.

Now, I am no stranger to the hospital as I usually have to go a couple times a year for panic attacks. When I was in the triage room the doctor I saw three weeks ago, for alcoholic gastritis and who told me to quit the alcohol, pops his head in because he heard a nervous voice (me). He looks at me and goes “what’s goin on?” And I told him that I was worried about my brain and drinking and he responded with “I thought we were gonna stop that!”. I felt so embarrassed but he was really kinda about it after.

So I’m sitting in the ER room, with my mother because I’m a nervous wreck, and they give me some vitamins and saline through an IV and take some blood. Eventually the doctor comes back and tells me that all my liver function and all the other stuff are extremely healthy. At this time I noticed the feeling in my legs and feet is “mysteriously” gone as I had calmed down by now.

He sent out a test for B1, because apparently our small hospital can’t test for it, and said he would get back to me with the results but he doesn’t think it will be off. I asked him if it was possible for my liver to progress to failure after three weeks and he looked at me like I was nuts. He then looked at me very seriously and said, “If you KEEP drinking, one day you will get there.” And I just sat there in silence.  

So I’m back on day 1 and will hopefully get through the next weekend. I can’t keep getting this anxious so I’m just gonna have to really commit this time to ZERO. I really hate this.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50356823}"

I replaced running with drinking.

Now I recently started running again and, I have to say, it's like i have a superpower. There's something about addiction and long distance running that really mesh well.

I feel like addicts have already trained their bodies with the mental part of feeling pain and pushing past it. I disagree that addicts are ""weak"". They may not strong in some obvious ways, but some things they're REALLY good at!

How many times have I continued on in my day, ignoring how shitty I feel? Ignoring bruises and aches, ignoring upset an upset stomach, ignoring alcohol craving (until the next one that is)

Well, listen up! Your body can continue to suffer (you're already primed yourself) but NOW people will ADMIRE you for it! 

You can run and feel like shit and push past it and instead of getting more and more weak through drinking you can get stronger through physical exercise. Seriously, running with other people who complain about their toes hurting or nipples chafing or whatever is a weird experience cuz i'll feel these things physically but not really pay attention to them as much. People will be like, how do you go out and run and doesn't it hurt? And I'll think, yeah it's hurts but i'm used to it and dare i say . .. i kind of like it?

I don't get drunk everyday, and I can go periods of time when I don't drink at all, but when I do drink I binge drink for days. I never drink if I have work the next day, and I never drink at work either because I have to drive home. 

Being a bar tender is so hard though. Going to work and being surrounded by alcohol makes it hard to cope with not drinking, but then the long shifts and the stress of the job makes me go home and drink. I don't even really enjoy my job. When I go home I find an excuse to drink, whether it's that I can't sleep or need alcohol to unwind. Then the next thing I know is I'm too drunk to do anything. 

I know I need a new job, but there are unemployed people out there who need work more than me, and I feel like I'm taking their jobs. I just feel like I'm at a dead end in life and everything is only going to go downhill for me.

I can't stand the feeling of craving alcohol and panicking when I know I can't drink, but I can't see myself living life without it. I love the act of making cocktails, I love the smell and the taste. I guess I just want to be able to enjoy alcohol without getting drunk, and be able to control my drinking more.

I'm just starting lose hope with life right now, and can't see things getting better. I want to stop needing alcohol, but I don't want to stop drinking it either.

It's been a while since I posted here. 

My wife and I have been separated for almost 2 years now. During that time, I've worked through a lot of my own inner mess and focused on improving myself mentally, physically, and spiritually. Yesterday, we met to touch bases. I didn't know what I was expecting, but I got closure: her heart's no longer in the marriage. As disappointing as that was (and my desire to block out the pain), I stayed sober. 

My sobriety has taught me a lot, but the biggest things are

* I am worth it.
* Life without alcohol (as daunting as it seemed at first) is beautiful
* I'm not made of glass. 
* Life doesn't stop and drinking won't stop the hurt. It only delays ripping off the bandage.

I never in my life had elevated LFTs, so I either have a liver of steel or it’s too far gone that there’s no enzymes left to die...

Halp. Also can you have ascites if your albumin is normal? Range was 3.5-5 and mine came in at 4.8. Can i have portal hypertension with normal/high platelets?

I am coming up on 8 months of sobriety (total sobriety! Finally kicked weed about 5 months ago). I really have come to embrace this life. Life feels so much bigger and impactful. I feel completely present in my own existence and have no desire to drink ever again. But man, that's the last thing these multi-billion dollar companies want.

Over the past months I've been so surprised by how much alcohol ads and product placement trigger me. I used to think of them just as funny little things or, in the case of product placement an element for realism. Now, they seem to legitimately jeopardize my goal of living a sober life. Here are some examples of what I'm talking about.

New Falcon and the Winter Soldier episode, they are drinking Heinekens after work. Something I did for years. Huge trigger.

Watched this new show Mare of Easttown, the bar she goes to was just like my old dive. Got me good.

The goddamn WAZZZUPP Budweiser commercial. How? HOW? SO DUMB....so effective.

To people who have found help through AA or other popular programs, please know I respect you and admire the work you do!   


Personally, I am sober after realizing that 1 always became 3 and once a week always became nightly.  I rarely blacked out and (luckily) can say there was not rock bottom event.  I felt out of control and I knew I wasn't living my best.  So I quit (it was not easy).  I have found great value in talking with my AA friends and in the Buddhist recovery world, but others I know really feel unable to enter these spaces because of labels and shame.  


Since the pandemic, several friends have approached me about their own drinking and I can hear the stories they are telling themselves about it even as they come to me for advice.  They reject the label of alcoholic and this is part of the excuse to keep drinking.  Their path is their own, but I feel like there is a need for more resources for people in situations like this.  


Two books that I know of are: The Naked Mind and Sober Curious.  Both are great and speak to this situation.  Are there any others that were helpful to people?

At that time, I intended to get and stay sober for two months, and get repeat bloodwork done in mid-March after eight weeks of no alcohol. However, I fell off the wagon and started drinking again in late February... and kept drinking well into March. Not heavily, and not everyday, but enough that I was extremely disappointed with myself—and I knew I had to push the repeat bloodwork date back. 

So, on March 22, I re-committed to sobriety, and booked myself a bloodwork date of April 19, today. 

And, today's results just came in: after four weeks sober, GGT has dropped to 44 (*almost* normal range), and my ALT is down to 19 (normal). Other liver enzymes looking great too: ALP is 56 (normal 35-120), and AST is 12 (normal is under 30). 

I'm so relieved, and so proud of myself. I wanted to post for others who might be scared about their own results: it's amazing how resilient the liver is, and how much it can heal if you give it a rest.

I was really unsure about whether or not I should post this, but here it goes. Today marks a year that I started my journey to truly get sober. I started writing this as a kind of conscious stream of thought to remind myself of how much has changed during that time, and more importantly how bad things became because of my addiction to drugs and alcohol. In reflection I wish I knew much, much earlier that I wasn’t too far gone, and that there was a way out. I feel compelled to share my experience with the hope that someone that is where I was on April 19th, 2020 knows that a better life is possible, you are not too far gone, and your life matters.

A little background: I’m a white man, I was born into an upper-middle class family. By all accounts I had a very fortunate, Leave It to Beaver-esque childhood. No trauma, nothing I can really blame as a cause for my alcoholism.

My drinking career started as a middle schooler and concluded when I was 29. It wasn’t really until undergraduate school that I became a full blown alcoholic, albeit a high functioning one that managed to keep a large social circle and the same girlfriend from freshman until senior year. I obviously had a problem, which evolved over time, but never suffered any major consequences so I never felt compelled to quit.

Fast forward to Valentines day, 2018. Living with the same girlfriend from college making a really good salary. We’ve got significant savings we plan on using for a wedding, we have a great social circle, we vacation often. On paper my life is amazing. In reality I’m drinking almost a fifth of vodka everyday and blacking out constantly. I’ve also discovered pain killers and cocaine. Work is suffering, and the relationship comes to a fiery end during a black out so the details are fuzzy but from what I’ve been told there’s lots of yelling, clothes getting thrown out onto the lawn, and some other things get broken. How the police didn’t get involved is a mystery to me.

By the end of 2018 I will be terminated from my high paying job for continuously showing up drunk.

2019 rolls around and I’m unemployed, drinking vodka from the moment I wake up until the moment I pass out. Theres a lot to cover from that year but here are the highlights:

* 7 alcohol related 5150s
* 6 more job losses. Longest position I was able to hold is 2 months. I am incapable of staying sober long enough to make it through a work day and am fucked up on vodka and cocaine constantly 
* 4 public intoxication arrests
* Savings = Depleted; Credit card = Maxed out
* Friends = gone. Family = want nothing to do with me. I feel completely alone

New Years Eve 2019 comes and I’m on the verge of homelessness. I can’t pay my rent for January and I have $10 to my name. Against his better judgement my dad allows me to move home and… nothing changes. I’m miserable, I want to change, but from where I was sitting my life was over. There was no way to get out of the hole I had dug for myself. So I said fuck it, I’ll give up. I got a job at a local market bagging groceries and figured this is it.

I wanted to die. I wasn’t living, I was existing. As 2020 progresses I become more and more suicidal. The thought “I want to die” morphs into a more deliberate train of thought weighing the pros and cons of various methods of committing suicide. On April 19th, 2020, I woke up around 6am and as easily as one decides what they will make for breakfast, I decide today is the day I am going to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge.

So I went there, I lifted myself over the railing, and with 1 inch of space between my toes and the open air leading down almost 400 feet to the San Francisco Bay - I just stood there. I thought about all the things that should have been and wasn’t. The weird thing is I wasn’t scared, I actually felt a massive sense of relief, like the nightmare was finally over. At that moment someone called out to me from the roadway above and my first thought wasn’t “I don’t want to do this” it was “I don’t want to ruin this guys day”.

But that man saved my life. Because of him I came back over the railing and that started my journey to sobriety. In the Crisis Stabilization Unit a nurse shared with me his struggle with alcoholism and made me believe, for the first time, that my life was worth living. That it wasn’t over. That I could be saved. I seized that granule of hope for a better life he instilled in me and I made a decision to fight for my life and get sober. First with a 30 day residential psychiatric facility, then a 30 day inpatient rehab, and finally 8 months at a sober living home. And you know what happened during all that time? I took my life back. This is my life today:

* 6 figure salary in a job that I love
* Sweet 1 BR apartment in a major Bay Area city
* New (to me) car
* Respect from my family and friends
* Working my way out of debt
* Building a savings/ 401k/ Roth IRA

Is my life perfect? Absolutely not, but it’s manageable and on an upward trajectory. I still have wreckage that needs to be addressed but I’m making solid progress. I’ve had three relapses during this time and with each one it steels my resolve to continue along this path and not to roll over.

The takeaway I have for someone who was where I was not too long ago is this: no matter how bad things are, no matter how much it may feel like your life is over, there is a better life out there. And you can have it. Nothing that has happened can stop you from improving the position you find yourself in today.

TL;DR Alcohol took my job, financial security, apartment, literally everything and last year on this day I tried to commit suicide because of it. A stranger intervened which put me on the road to recovery. No matter how bad things are there’s always a way out.

Afterward, it was a like a light switch flipped in my brain. Drastically reduced alcohol and sugar cravings, and a mood that strangely felt like happy (hadn't felt that in a long time).  Two weeks later tried again. Only made it to 36 hours but I have been diligent about avoiding large amounts of sugar, processed carbs and zero gluten since reintroducing food. It's just night and day. My alcohol cravings are pretty much zero right now and my mood is so much better, even though it's not perfect.

Then I tell myself I can go back to ""moderate"" drinking, which climbs to heavy-moderate drinking as my tolerance goes back up. Its been over a year since I last took a break, and am drinking quite a bit more than I want to be. Since Christmas, (I always drink way too much in December), I have never really come back down, and have been well over my ""moderate drinking"" goals for months now. 

I would say I'm functional, but honestly, not very. I feel like garbage every weekend, and Mondays too. I am not very productive at work. My career and goals are stagnant. During the day I'm addicted to my computer, and am not really present in my day to day life.  I can see clearly that its easier to not drink at all, than to spend so much energy trying to moderate my drinking, but at the end of the day I'll take any excuse to drink a few beers. Part of me know that I need to stop drinking again, but I've been through this so many times before.  I can just picture myself, going through all the steps and ending up right back where I am now. Just lowering my tolerance by drying up for a bit so I can have this perfect harm-free way to let myself get drunk once amonth, then once a week, then three, then four days a week... the cycle repeats. I'm afraid of failing again, and I'm even afraid of being successful, because I want to keep allowing myself to get drunk. It feels so pointless. 

I'm not nearly as bad as I used to be, but I can see where this is headed. Its just drifting back to heavier and heavier drinking, because one drink still seems pointless to me, when you could have 4 or 6 or 10. 

Anyway, just wanted to vent. I am frustrated and dont really feel like stopping, even though I feel I'm on a bad path. I'll probably wait until Friday and then drink more than I planned on and feel crappy again Saturday morning. I wonder what it will take for me to stop.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5551779}"

I did not drink though, and although I spent more time obsessing and lamenting over not being able to enjoy an IPA by the fire than I would care to admit, I feel very accomplished for going outside my comfort zone and facing my anxiety without alcohol during a very triggering situation. It felt very vulnerable. Camping with beer is a huge thing for me, so although I would have loved it to be 100% anxiety free and blissful I am glad to have one trip under my belt.

I did good, I thought about drinking before they were out of the driveway but I kept those urges at bay and distracted myself throughout the weekend.

I don’t really pay much mind to mother simply to keep my own mental health somewhat okay.

Mom: “cause we needed one. We can go buy some wine now to put in it”

Mom: “just incase anyone comes over”

Me: “the world is in a pandemic and I’m working on my sobriety! What the actual fuck mom?!” 

Mom: “oh don’t be so silly, you don’t drink wine”

Me: “that’s not how alcoholism works and yes, I actually did drink wine, goes to show how much you know”



And that was basically it. I know trying to talk to her is only going to frustrate me even more so I usually leave whatever room she’s in

.. come to think of it, whenever I mention I’m X weeks sober, no one congratulates me or says good job.. so thank you r/stopdrinking cause you guys are my backbone most days

I had to get that last beer in.

Despite years of therapy, I was spinning my wheels for a long time trying to deal with some mental health challenges. Since getting sober, I've developed a ton of new coping skills, and I'm capable of sitting with uncomfortable feelings instead of numbing them.

I am unemployed, and my living situation is super not ideal right now. But that's okay! I have good support around me. I'm dealing my PTSD from my past job, and working on getting into an entirely different field that will make me feel more fulfilled and won't give me flashbacks. When I have a year of sobriety under my belt, I'll have my certifications and qualifications ready to go to be a Peer Support Counselor for addiction, and then I'm going back to school to become a Substance Use Disorder Counselor.

I have a ton of support around me right now. I'm so grateful for my friends, my SUD counselor, my peers in group therapy, my therapist, and my vocational counselor. I've never been so engaged in my treatment before, and it feels so good to finally be making progress. If you're struggling to get things under control, I highly recommend getting yourself into an IOP program if that's an option for you.

1) Exercise helps.  In my case, long distance running.  Instead of suffering through hangovers, suffer from sore legs and fatigue.   
2) The cravings were the worst in the first week and went away a good bit but not completely.  Would seemingly come out of nowhere like a sunny day or hearing a good song.  
3) Triggers for me are making dinner after work, and Friday after work.  Need some type of transition and wine or beer always was the 'door'.  Need to unwind.  
5) I feel like a get in irritable moods more easily but I'm thinking I only had two moods while drinking heavily: elation and wretchedness.  
6) Social situations are worse, definitely feel like I'm not in a groove when talking with others.  My dry humor doesn't go over as well and feel a bit awkward.  
7) My family is happier and doing better (have had some very rough patches with my daughter)  
8) One day at a time is the best philosophy  
9) My app tells my I skipped 150 drinks and saved $600, which is a surprising amount.

Me and my friends were drinking most weekends, and somehow I always got too drunk. When I had my first sip, I needed more. Every time.

Why I couldn't stop, I don't understand. I have the same feeling with the cookie jar. I crave it, I want more, and I don't have self control. Only difference is; the cookie jar doesn't get me drunk.

Now I'm eighteen, and of legal age. I drank much, now i drink much and often. I drink like a fish. I still work at the bar, and the cookie jar is everywhere. I often get drunk at work. 

My friends have started hinting at me, that I have a problem. I've always known, I just never wanted to work on it. Anyways, now I chose to.

I reall don't understand it. Why do I want alcohol so bad. Why can't I stop. There is no anxiety or trauma I'm trying to stop. And I really don't understand the logic of spending money and calories, by getting drunk, and play sober. I just wanna.

So my stepson is graduating from high school next month, and his mother is throwing him a small, outdoor, socially distanced graduation party at her parents' house. Last night my husband and I were on speakerphone with her asking what we could bring and talking through logistics. At the end of the call, she said ""Oh, and just throwing this out there to everyone, but my parents are complete teetotalers, so please don't bring any wine or anything to their house.""

It caught me off guard and made me wonder what stepson has told her about me. My answer was a sort of stilted ""I don't drink... Wine."" I didn't mean it to, but it sounded almost exactly like that line from the old Dracula movie with I believe Keanu Reeves. She makes me uncomfortable anyway, so then I started giggling because I tend to laugh when I'm nervous anyway. My husband shot me a proper WTF look, but he was fighting back laughing too.

I had had a rough death at work (I’m a nurse, it was traumatizing) and difficult patients throughout the week. It was a Wednesday. I was headed for an 8 day stretch off to get engagement pictures done with my fiancé for our upcoming wedding (spoiler alert, my fiancé is so supportive but our large wedding has been canceled due to what you are about to read). 

I decided to hit the local bar that opens at 7 am. I met new friends—other nurses from other hospitals—and we talked about our week and how pumped we were for time off. At one point there was three shots in front of me. I had started with two trulys mixed together in a pint glass, and I was asking for trouble. 

I don’t know what time I left. In fact, I don’t remember leaving at all. 

I made it two blocks before I injured a pedestrian. Thank GOD I did not kill this person. The first thing I remember is talking with the police, sitting on the curb. I called my lawyer, immediately. Told him I had stopped to render aid but that I did not hit her. I still don’t remember that. I won’t, ever. I stopped, but what followed was obvious. An arrest and a felony Intoxication Assault charge. 

My nursing career is hanging in the balance. My lawyer is expensive and “working on things” but for now, I’m being monitored by an ankle bracelet and a breathalyzer in my car, that I only drive to work and to AA meetings if I can’t find a ride.

So I'll be hitting 2 years in August and I am really glad/grateful to not be drinking. I barely think about it anymore and don't have any wishes to return. But...I am still having drinking dreams, at least 2-3 per month. And I'm not a psychologist or a dream interpreter, but I feel like I've noticed a trend in when I have these dreams. The dream almost always goes like this: I'm out with people I don't know very well, I decide I can handle a drink, I start to get buzzed, and then I'm panicking trying to figure out how I'm going to rationalize it to my loved ones. I wake up upset, with the prevailing feelings being shame/guilt. And I've noticed these happen when I've done something I feel bad about irl, primarily losing my temper and being rude to someone at work. So I just wanted to put that out there, that maybe sometimes the drinking dreams aren't really about the drinking, but how guilty it would make me feel to go back, reflecting on guilt about other things in my life. Food for thought in case this is the case for any of you.

TL;DR: Girlfriend ended things with me two days ago after a big drunken fight. I have a long history with alcohol but was always in denial about its effect on me. I finally want to take responsibility and let go of the bottle once and for all.

Alcohol has been around me all my life. Dad was a heavy drinker, and physically & emotionally abusive toward my mother when drunk. It used to terrify me when I heard the clang of the wine bottle on the kitchen bench as he filled in his first drink of the night. Because I knew what was coming. He is a doctor and the stress of the job didn’t help matters. Especially back in the 90s. That sound still gives me jitters from time to time.

I started drinking when I was 15, but I really hit it hard as a 19 year old. Mainly bingeing on weekends to begin with, but also seeped into weekdays as a regular thing. I drank for the buzz and the social pressure at the time. My first relationship rolled around. This is when, only in hindsight, do I recognise that my behaviour first started to mimic that of dad’s. I was never physical, but used to scream at the top my lungs at her about the smallest things, and really pick at the things I knew really hurt her. The worst of it was only when I was drinking. It was a miracle it lasted 4 years.

Med school rolled around and, unfortunately, also did the big drinking culture associated with it. I lived with housemates who liked a drink too. My second relationship began at the time. It was long distance and it was really challenging. I used alcohol to cope. Because I didn’t get to see her often, we argued all the time on the phone because of my insecurities about the distance. When she ended things, it was, again, only after a long shouting match while I was drunk. She cut off all contact and I never saw or heard from her again.

Fast forward to 2020. Working as an emergency medicine doctor during COVID-19 thankfully was manageable in the country I work given the low number of cases. But we still saw significant death and suffering. I started dating a wonderful woman from work who is also a doctor. Early in the relationship however, we drank together often. Lockdown made this much more an available and tempting choice to spend our time. We developed a comfortable and regular relationship with alcohol also as a way to cope with the job. But despite my previous experiences with alcohol and relationships, I failed to recognise that it should be the last thing I use to cope. We fought only when we were drunk and never when sober. Then 2 days ago we had a big fight at her house. It was about the smallest most insignificant thing. But it ended with me being verbally aggressive, abusive and refusing to leave. I terrified her and made her feel unsafe for the first and last time. She ended things the next day.

I am not making excuses anymore. Alcohol is a big reason I have failed in all my previous relationships. I have failed myself. I also recognise that it is not the only cause of my failures; that exploring and understanding the deeper reasons for why I reach for the bottle will take time. But the shackles need to come off first. For myself, the people I love and the patients I care for.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I had a reckoning this weekend and my wife finally confronted me about my drinking.  My use has been steady but unwavering and whilst I think I've been so smart at hiding it, she has instead been worrying, laying in bed and fretting over my behaviour.  

To say I felt mortified, would be an understatement.   To know that my behaviour, which was just drinking alone in the evening, was causing so much worry and hurt to my wife, was devastating.  I've always seen my drinking as my own private thing, not impacting on others, but I was so wrong.  I've quit before and had 6 blissful months of no booze, but I gave myself a window back in, by just passing my giving up as a 'health kick'.  Well not this time.  We had some very difficult conversations about my drinking habits and how I hate being reliant on trying to, on a daily basis, manage this devil.  The odds in which I go to to keep it private.  But no more, I've beared my soul to my wife and she was so supportive.

I know this is my journey in many ways and it is on me to remain as honest as I was this weekend, but I felt unshackled and liberated from this private war I've been waging for years. I now have a powerful ally who I can talk to and I consider myself to be so lucky that she didn't just walk away.  

In many ways we have a wonderful life, good jobs, beautiful kids and a lovely home.  I am ready to experience all of that now with a sober mind and to build upwards, instead of digging downwards.

I don’t feel ashamed or guilty about it, it was honestly kind of interesting to see how my feelings had changed about alcohol after 2 solid months sober. I’m moving several states away and I was living with my parents prior. Two nights ago they wanted to have a drink with me as part of a little going away party, so I obliged. Nothing crazy, had about 4 shots worth of liquor, got a little buzzy and stopped. Kind of forgot how badly it fucks up your equilibrium, I did not enjoy the slight dizzy feeling. Haven’t drank since then and don’t have a desire to.

Overall I did enjoy myself, and I did enjoy getting a little “loose” with my parents, as they’re normally very conservative and reserved people. But the bottom line is I enjoyed sobriety too. The first month of no booze was hard, and that alone indicates I did have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. But after that I fell into a rhythm, and I ended up enjoying my sober weekends and getting to know myself all over again. I don’t think I’ll be going back to drinking my weekends away. I don’t want to dilute myself or my experience of life anymore. I like who I am sober. 

Is my goal to never drink again? Honestly, I didn’t know when I first dropped booze, and I still don’t know now, and I’m okay with that. What I can say is that I sure as hell don’t ever want to drink alone again. I don’t want to drink as a reward, or as a way to relax/unwind, or as a source of fun. I’ve found other things to do that perform those jobs better than alcohol does, so I will keep doing those things instead. No need to over-complicate anything. I will remain vigilant about falling into bad patterns of behavior in the future. Alcohol is an addictive drug. There is no forgetting that fact.

But it was always excused by me and those around me because I have many health issues, pain, and also will eventually die regardless of what I do. Do I need to help myself into the grave though? I have a genetic illness and have lived many years longer than ever expected. I want more years but alcohol helps temporarily with the pain and anxiety so it does become difficult to stop. My liver function is good and for all intents and purposes I seem to function well. Apparently alcoholism is quite common for people with my condition. It is largely unaddressed though and that may be due, in part, to issues surrounding the fact that we don’t live that long anyways.  However I’m in my late 30s and want to do what is best for me (when I was diagnosed I wasn’t expected to live past the age of 15 if that gives an indicator of the seriousness and I literally almost died when I was 15).  I had to learn to walk again and all sorts of stuff-I did go on to college and graduate school and a pretty successful life, however I am now disabled and unable to work.

I wanted to make sure to say thanks and try to pay it forward.,"I just wanted to express how important and helpful this sub has been. I’ve never posted on Reddit before and felt compelled to post and try to help others. Just a stream of random thoughts below but hopefully it’s helpful to some. 

I’m in my mid 20s and fall into the weekend binge drinking crowd, which feels like the norm for my age/social group. I’ve seen others with similar backgrounds post on here and I hope this post can be helpful. I feel this drinking problem can be extremely harmful, but feel like it doesn’t actually qualify as a “problem” given the prevalence in society. 

Given my age and the fact that my drinking wouldn’t normally impact my weekday life I couldn’t ever bring myself to really attempt to quit, but try to moderate for years which just didn’t work. Eventually I hit a breaking point and got the nerve to finally try it and I am frankly mad I didn’t do it sooner! 

I was very hesitant to quit given the perceived social stigma of not drinking and since you wouldn’t know I had a drinking problem on the surface. However, this has proven to be a non-issue. Telling friends/family was the best decision for me as they were universally supportive and it gave me more reasons to stick to it, as I didn’t want to let them as well as myself down. 

I was worried I would lose friends or not enjoy my social scene but I’ve hung out with people drinking heavily in social settings and found it to be more enjoyable if anything not to drink given the more meaningful conversations and lack of negative consequences of drinking. 

The better sleep, lack of hangovers, better mental health, better hygiene, eating better, working out more, better at work, better with relationships are others positives that are noticeable very quickly and surprise you when you take stock of things even after only a month. 

It’s a long road ahead and I’m only a month down but it’s honestly a road I’m excited to take. I’m proud to be able to have stopped for this long and I am genuinely excited for the future. If anyone is in a similar situation to me please give it a try, I don’t think you will be disappointed.",33,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6339195}"

2021-04-18 15:52:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mtk22a/long_night_of_temptation/,Long Night Of Temptation,"Last night the loneliness hit.

I think you know what I mean when I say this. My roommates were both out and I was left alone in the house. My neighbors were having a birthday party, and people were piled into the backyard.  They were all so happy, singing happy birthday to their friend. My birthday was two weeks ago.  I didn't have a party.

I could see the backyard from my balcony above them. I sat out there, balcony light off, lurking in the dark like a bat. I wanted to feel some of their energy, absorb it from afar. I started to fantasize. I wanted one of them to shout out to me. Maybe ask ""are you vaxxed? (I am) come on down! The more the merrier! Have a drink!""

My fantasy included that. Drinking with them. That's something that I used to be able to do when I was drinking. I could gel with any group of people because drunk me was loquacious, joyful, and friendly.  Many times I'd wake up after a night of drinking not only with a wicked hangover but with friend requests from people I didn't remember, sometimes urgent texts from unknown numbers asking if I wanted to go on a date. It's interesting how many people live inside us. I wish I could access her without alcohol.

But sober me is very quiet, reserved, shy. A shyness that can be read as weirdness at best and downright rudeness at worst. See the example of me lurking above a stranger's birthday party. In the wrong situation, I might be seen as a total creep.

The party fantasy was very strong and vivid. And I had a moment of ""maybe I'm better now, maybe I can just drink and have fun like I used to."" There is alcohol in the house that belongs to my roommate. They drink a lot. You'd think this might tempt me, but seeing them get sloppy and embarrassing, and wake up hungover has actually helped me in my resolution. But still, the obsession crept in. That somehow the way to end the loneliness was to drink.

I struggled all night long with this. The party sounds went on long into the night. Dance music breaking into my bedroom as I tried to read a book quietly. I was reading a book about grief and it became too poignant. I used the coping strategies that I've learned to get me this far and was able to make it through. But it's always blindsiding when it hits. I have been sober for 11 months. I started after the beginning of quarantine. So I haven't really had my resolve tested in a party setting since they've been verboten for the past year. Last night scared me.

When I was drinking, I was a party drinker. I drank to get wild. and I did get wild. Then when there wasn't a party, and I wanted to drink, I'd engineer one. Let's celebrate each day that ends in y. Sometimes I'd be doing this by myself if no one was game. The energy of a party was what I strived for. A never-ending stasis of good feelings, friends, perfect music. Freedom. A night that never ends. But of course, all nights end.

I woke up today SO glad I didn't drink. The moment had passed. I looked down into the yard this morning at the detritus, the mess, the emptiness. That would have been me this morning if I had given in.

Before I got sober, I went to a couple meetings and always left feeling like I didn't have a problem, because all the stories were so severe compared to mine. I guess a part of me struggles with feeling like I wasn't ""alcoholic enough"" for it and I felt stupid for being there (I absolutely am an alcoholic-one drink would never be one drink-it would always be blacking out. Toward the end, often 4-5+ times a week). I know that's a dumb way of looking at it, I know people who go to meetings who never ""hit rock bottom,"" I know that anyone can be an alcoholic. I just don't want to end up feeling like I don't have a problem again. Before, meetings convinced me I didn't have a problem and gave me validation to keep drinking. I guess that perspective is shifted a bit now...I don't think I'd go to a meeting now and be like ""ah yeah I wasn't that bad, off to the bar!"" but it's still a shitty feeling to have.

Anyway, I've been sober for two years but I feel like I missed out a lot on the healing parts of getting sober. I never processed anything and I never really dealt with it, I just stopped. But my thinking patterns are often the same (is this the ""dry-drunk"" people refer to?). Would AA help me in this way? OR, are there any other options?

We got there kind of early and the people I was with immediately went to the bar and got drinks. The social anxiety kicked in something fierce. What am I supposed to do with myself if I can't sit here with a drink in my hand? It was extremely uncomfortable, so at peak anxiety I got out my phone and started scrolling through this sub. Then after some time some more people started showing up and I got off my ass and started being social and then all of a sudden the experience completely flipped around. I was having fun! I was meeting new people and having fun conversations! Without alcohol! The highlight of the evening was when the most beautiful drop dead gorgeous girl at the party started chatting with me because she noticed that I wasn't drinking because she wasn't drinking either, and we ended up having a great conversation. 

Normally in that situation I would have gotten wasted. I would have been the first one at the bar and the last one at the bar and would have probably drank like 10 beers and multiple shots of tequila. Would have woken up this morning with a hangover feeling like an asshole with a completely wasted Sunday in front of me. Instead I learned something really important about myself: I can have fun and be social and be interesting in a social situation without alcohol. Experiencing social anxiety is uncomfortable, but it's not a death sentence. 

Part of what I think might make this new attempt at sobriety successful is that I haven't decided to stop drinking. I'm not telling anyone that I'm giving up alcohol and I'm not making any lifelong commitments to anything. I tried that before and it was too much. It felt oppressive and it weirded my friends out and I ended up not being able to do it anyway. Instead what I'm focusing on this time is not drinking today. One of my friends noticed I wasn't drinking this weekend and asked me if I was giving up alcohol and I was like oh no, I'm just not drinking today. 😊 So much less heavy, less commitment, less explanation.

My weight has always been an issue, but it got really bad (338 lbs) at the peak of my drinking. Since quitting, I’ve lost 23 lbs (even with the initial sugar cravings). The last month or so, I’ve found myself eating better, too. I don’t crave all the sugar I once did and have been making much healthier meal decisions- helping me to loose another 9 lbs. This spurred me to join a sub for obese people who are working towards a healthy weight. I found an app that tracks my nutritional data, too. Both these things have really helped me stay accountable and make positive changes in how/what I eat.

I’ve also set a date to quit smoking. I quit for a couple years in my early 20’s so I know it’s going to be hard, but I also know that if I quit drinking then I can quit smoking. My workplace charges an extra $25 per pay and your health insurance deductible doubles if you’re a smoker. That resets every August. I can join their tobacco cessation program then and it’ll stop those extra fees in 2022. I’m a little nervous, but I’m going to do it. After all, I was nervous about quitting drinking and that’s worked out to be the best thing I’ve ever done. 

So, if you’re new to sobriety or just considering getting started- it’s soooo worth it! I know it seems really overwhelming at first. Like you’ve dug yourself into a hole and can’t see any way out. But the truth is that you can get out- it just takes time. Don’t forget to thank yourself for all the good decisions you make each day and think about how far you’ve come instead of how far you have to go.

Everyone else in my life thinks I should, but I also see how overly pushed that form of treatment is as a first line of defense. What I want is obviously not been the best pol to draw a decision from, but I want to pursue a meeting oriented early recovery and find myself an apartment and get back to work.

This was technology forcing a body to perform what it wasn’t capable of doing on its own any longer, in order to give his friends and family some closure. 

Masked and scrubbed up, and only two people at a time, we rallied. We reminisced. We told him we’re so sorry. We held his hands through latex gloves and cradled his head. We cried. We told him it’s ok to let go. No more pain. 

It was a beautiful day when I arrived at the hospital yesterday. High 70’s, sun shining, big puffy clouds in a brilliant blue sky. Birds chirping, flowers blooming. Are people supposed to die on a day like this? 

These are the words I heard as I left the hospital: 

His father: “what a waste of potential” 
His mother: “thank you for loving my son”

24 years we spent on this earth together. He was the brother I never had. A groomsman in our wedding. The uncle to my only son. My partner in crime. My existential muse. My human diary. And he’s gone. Yesterday was his last day on earth and he died (mostly) alone. 

Ten years of being a “functional alcoholic”,  the last two being in and out of detox and hospital because his body was breaking. My heart is shattered. This wasn’t supposed to be part of the plan. I’m without my BFF and another mother has to bury her child. I can’t believe he’s gone. 

I’ll see you in another life, brother.

I only drink heavily at my bfs house when we are doing nothing and chilling. I am able to limit my alcohol use when I’m at a restaurant or a party. So it’s only at my bfs (so this drinking behavior only happens at my bfs) 

I try to moderate my drinking and set goals, but I keep failing. This might cause me to buzz drive and that disappoints me to much. I think the best thing is to just not drink at all.

My drinking problem is not the everyday drinker, but my issue is whenever I am out with friends or have free reign to drink as much as I want, I usually just keep going and  going. I was known as the alcoholic of my group of friends growing up because I was always binge drinking at every chance I could get back then when we would party or if we were just hanging out. Always had a beer in hand and if I didn’t I felt anxiety and didn’t want to be there. Numerous times I turned down doing things because if there wasn’t alcohol I wasn’t interested because I needed it to feel like I could be social. The more I drank the more I felt like I was alive. I continued doing this for years until I knew I was having a child. My wife quit cold turkey and hardly has touched a drink since. I continued on my days off to get pretty much blackout drunk. I always loved having two days off in a row because I knew I could get as drunk as I wanted one of the nights and have the next day to recover. 

I had a couple beers at the casino on vacation in January, did fine I thought. Had a couple beers at Disney the next week and was doing good. A few weeks later I resorted back to drinking at home again on occasion, and last week went out with my friend who struggles with drinking as well, and we got absolutely hammered.

Thought I'd share it for anyone who needs to read another success story.

*ETA: just noticed it is day 300 though!! And that's pretty cool!!*

I was someone who thought about quitting for at least six months but just never pulled the trigger. I checked my blood donation history and on April 24, 2020, I went and donated blood against my better judgement, having crushed a box of wine with my husband the night before. 

I have a history of getting light headed when I donate, and not surprisingly, this time was like 100x worse. I didn't think much of it going in because I'd run a 5k totally hungover. I thought I was invincible.

I donated just fine but it took me at least 30 minutes of lying down, trying to sit back up, without feeling like I was going to pass out. I was super pale, my blood pressure was ridiculous. The Red Cross staff was about to call an ambulance to have me transported to a hospital. They said if I'm not recovered and can walk in that 30 minutes (I think it was) they had no choice. I was incredibly embarrassed and did everything I could to make them believe I was okay to drive home. I was not about to explain to a nurse why I was so dehydrated. 

I got myself home okay and spent the day on the couch while my kids sat in front of the tv.    All I did was think about how much time I'm wasting away drinking and being hungover. How much I'm taking my health for granted. 

As you can see from my counter, I didn't quit that day. It took another two months of convincing myself I didn't need alcohol. I ordered ""This Naked Mind"" two weeks after the blood donation incident and finally had my last drink on Father's Day 2020.

I'm not sure I'll ever be not surprised by how much energy I have now that I'm sober, and I can honestly say I don't think I'll ever be drunk again. I still take it one day at a time, especially because my husband still drinks.

I'm not religious and believe I only have one life to live and I'm no longer filling it with poison, a known carcinogen. It's wild that I thought it wouldn't affect me. Sobriety has made me the person I've always wanted to be.

Pros: Woke up this morning super grateful I wasn't hungover, and that I had another day to enjoy being work free. Usually I'm sloshed or hungover and don't really remember my weekends so it's like the work week never ends.

Grateful that I got to enjoy a movie night with my sister last night even though it upset me a little (Umbrella academy has addiction, suicide and violence y'all). Grateful I didn't forget the little things I did yesterday.

Overall it's been amazing how many it feels like I've done during the weekend because I can usually barely even feed myself!

Cons: Started having cravings shortly after I woke up and it's been flashing in my head. It pisses me off. But it's also made me realize something. I'm fucking *terrified* of being sober. Because everything scares me (basic things like going to work, making phone calls, etc.) and everyday I have to battle my own head.

But then I realize that when I drink, although I take that away, I also take away everything else. Like my chance to have a job, a friendship, to enjoy a yogurt, to enjoy time with friends or family, etc.

My life is a bit different now. I wake up fresh and with a lot less questions about the night before. I am saving a bit of money. I am able to be more present with myself and family. I still do struggle with my emotions and mental health, a lot of this I chalk up to these emotions being so raw, I am experiencing them in a new way.

I initially stopped drinking alcohol because I felt a lot of guilt and shame about what I was doing. 
I was not able to control how much I was drinking. I had been told my liver enzymes were high by a couple doctors, and I brushed it off. I was told I had fatty liver, but no scarring, and again I didn’t heed their warnings. I thought I was special and somehow this was normal.

I reached a point through the shutdowns and pandemic weirdness where I was drinking at a new ‘level’. I didn’t really pay attention to it. My partner asked me about it a couple times but I never really thought it was an issue. I thought I could just live my life how I wanted to and that other people drank so why couldn’t I ?? I would lie to myself and my partner about how much I was drinking. smh doing that was such a departure from who I am, and my values...

My sort of wake up call was around my bday in the fall. My father in law came to visit. It was a Friday night after my bday... I tied one on. I just kept pouring myself drinks. This was fairly normal, Fridays were the start of weekend binges. Drinking after errands Saturday am, often at 10 am.

I guess I blacked out that Friday and had all kinds of conversations that I didn’t remember and repeated the next day. Ugh. I was so embarrassed. I remember the looks he gave me, and was sort of watching me.. I was so so so hungover

I kept drinking though for another month or so. I just couldn’t find a place to stop. I had tried, through the fall, to drink lower abv beers... but that doesn’t work when you drink twice as many, or also buy a few bottles of liquor. I tried buying expensive liquor as a special treat, but turns out I still drink it at the same pace... same goes with the cheaper harder to stomach stuff.

In early October I read book that changed my viewpoint a bit and told a story I could relate more to. It was called ‘We are the Luckiest’ by Laura McKowen. 
This list in the book hit me pretty hard: 
1. It is not your fault 
2. It is your responsibility 
3. It’s unfair that this is your thing 
4. This is your thing 
5. This will never stop being your thing 
6. You cannot do it alone 
7. Only you can do it 
8. I love you 
9. I will never stop reminding you of these things 

I am a mid 30s male, but this story of a woman/parent struggling with alcohol, and her journey really really vibes with me.

I have read This Naked Mind. I have read Alan Carr’s book, they didn’t hit me in the same way. I have re-read We are the Luckiest and This Naked Mind, as reminders of why I am doing this... and I highly recommend doing that if you are struggling to get through a tough spot. THIS IS NOT AN EASY JOURNEY

I have been to al-anon as a kid. I have been to AA meetings with my sibling.... I just couldn’t imagine that I had a problem. This was something other people struggled with.

I really had a hang up that if I had an issue controlling alcohol in my life that I was flawed. That it confirmed all this negative self talk that I hear. Drinking also was such a part of what I thought my identity was. I had been drinking daily for so so so long, what would I do or be without it??!! It was scary. Shifting this mindset to it being my responsibility to help myself, to treat myself with kindness and love, helps me stay sober.

I really struggle on these ‘milestones’ I think shouldn’t I ‘be better’? Shouldn't I feel something? Shouldn't I have more to show? I am going to try to give these anniversaries a different meaning somehow. If anyone has any suggestions I am open to them...

I definitely would not be here today without the support from this community especially the IRC fam... I also have had some support from a couple other resources— AA on discord and a men’s meeting I found that meets on Zoom...

I really believe that our community is what gets a lot of us through the tough times. I also believe that I cannot do this alone. WE can do this together. I love you all, and I am a grateful 6month old. IWNDWYT",49,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.56621414}"

I'm currently 33 days sober, which is the longest I've managed in over 10 years. Managed to stay sober during some tough events, and I'm insanely proud of myself and super motivated (helps to be competitive in nature, towards myself at least, as every day now just adds to the longest streak and I do not want to give that up. May seems like a silly reason, but hey, if it stops me drinking I'll take it).

However, I've started running into a problem I've been dreading for a while now: friends....
Now, I only have 2 friends locally, and though I wouldn't necessarily say they are a horrible influence (I've had plenty of sober occasions with both) I initially connected with both over (you guessed it) cocktails. Ever since the start of these friendships we've had the occasional night out, where drinks would flow. For them, alcohol equals fun, and with lockdown loosening, I'm starting to get invites to go out.

The thing is, I'd happily meet either for drinks, just I'd want to stick to something without alcohol. I have no problem with them drinking while I don't (though I can imagine they might get annoying rather than entertaining when they've had too much so admittedly I'd probably bugger off home earlier than I would have in the past). But.... I know I'm crap at peer pressure and I feel there will be a fair bit of that. To give you an example my conversation about going out with one friend went a bit like this:

F: What do you say I book us a table outside next week and we'll go out for a few. I'm working next day so can't be too late but it has been ages.
Me: sure, but I am still not drinking, happy to go though I'll just have something else.
F: but it's been ages, surely you'll have a couple
Me: no honestly, I feel so much better without. Happy for you to drink just I'm sticking to something else. It'll be fun though.
F: lol, I'll end up looking like a lush with you not drinking I guess then.
Me: I doubt anyone will notice, there will be plenty of people around joining you haha.
F: okay, fair enough, I'll drive and then we can sort out later how we get home.
Me: I can drive, I'll be sober anyway. Its no hassle.
F: yeah but you may decide to have one or two though, you know, to celebrate....

Now, how the hell do you deal with this? I'm honestly happy to have a good time while she drinks and I don't, but I KNOW every time we order anything it'll be this conversation on repeat.... Any suggestions as to how I can stick to my boundaries?

Please can I ask not to suggest cutting contact. I know this would be a way around it, but like I said both are good friends and good people that I'm not willing to lose. Changing the dynamics of these friendships may be a battle and take time, sure, and if push comes to shove and they do not accept me wanting to remain sober that will be a bridge I may have to cross. But I owe both of them, and myself, a fair chance before blowing up years of friendship.

Been an alcoholic for 7 years. Had good times and a lot of bad ones. The same shit as many.

My health and motivation to take care of myself are going quickly down the shitter and while I have tried stopping before, I don't think I have a physical choice to stop or end up hospitalized. I have a fatty liver and the gut rot can be agonizing. I know my liver and health will improve, I just need to stop my alcohol intake by any means. 

Background, I am M34, live alone in Japan, no friends and family are too far away to assist other than words of support. Making friends in a pandemic is not possible. Especially outside a bar. 

I am an extremely functional binge drinker, every night for a solid three years (outside of a few occasions) I drink alone until I fall asleep at night and get up at 6am and work all day and it again. It's been essential to ward off insomnia but I went a month without drinking last year (somehow) and my sleep cycle got better. 

I take meds for my liver and BP but unless I stop drinking those will never improve. 

I have no people to talk to so reddit is all I have. I know AA is a route for many people but to be honest my only problems are my physical urge to drink. I never hurt anyone or need to be forgiven for ruining anybody's lives etc. I started drinking to more easily socialize in the beginning and it slowly became an evening habit I never stopped. I just really need coping strategies. Stopping those urges.

Questions to my fellow alcoholics:

Anyone have luck satiating urges with alternative beverages? I think sweet things do help curb my urges but was wondering if anyone else has suggestions.

I’m on day 20. And I’m struggling a bit because two of the major supports in my life aren’t taking my sobriety seriously.

I never had a rock bottom with drinking. I never even had what most people would consider a problem with booze. Still in my own estimation it has negatively affected my life, my performance in school, and my health. 

When I decided to quit last month, I was surrounded by a friend group of alcohol and cocaine addicts. One cannot say I haven’t witnessed the horrors of alcohol and blow even though it’s been secondhand. After one particular egregious round of drama and petty BS where these people were talking about me behind my back, I decided I needed to stop drinking and snorting for a week to clear my head. During that week I also decided to buy Quit Like a Woman on a whim.

Well that book completely changed my outlook on alcohol, and disabused me of the idea that society fed me about alcoholics vs normal drinkers. In other words the idea that some people can handle drinking and some people can’t. The book took the mask off alcohol, which I now see for the happiness stealing poison it is. And I’ve now read the evidence that like cigarettes, alcohol is potentially addictive to anyone in great enough quantities. This mental reframe allowed me to admit to myself that even though I’ve never had a “drinking problem” by traditional definitions, drinking has still been negatively affecting my life. 

Thus a week became almost three, and after reading This Naked Mind too, I never want touch the stuff again as long as I live. Rock bottom comes when you stop digging. And I’m done digging my admittedly shallow hole; I’m climbing out of it right fucking now.

The only struggle right now is nobody is taking me seriously. Some of the things I’ve heard:

“This totally makes sense for now, but I’m sure once you get some space from this friend group you can go back to having a couple drinks with new friends”

“You don’t need a full-court press effort for sobriety. You’ll be fine enjoying alcohol in moderation”

“You’re being extreme and too strict with yourself, you can definitely drink in moderation” 

And this from my step-mother and therapist who are both sober from serious alcohol problems! I believe both because of my age and the fact I’m walking away from booze relatively unscathed they think this is all fun and games. Still I’m disappointed. I would expect they of all people to understand...

Its always telling me' how far I've come' or that 'I'm alright now' as m life is ok now, compared to how it was. Thing is I still feel that the alcohol is.keeping me from the life I know I deserve. It's like I'm saying to myself 'well life's ok like this isn't it' but deep within myself I know this isn't true and every single bad decision I've ever made is because of drinking! Any ideas on how I can change my mindset would be fab. Just seems like my.mind goes round and round in an everlasting loop on the same thoughts, arguments and rationales.

2021-04-18 00:55:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mt6fqf/relapse_after_bad_injury/,Relapse after bad injury,"This is my first post from a new account. I made the account because it’s been so long since drinking has been an issue for me, that I forgot the login information for my old one. 

If you had read any posts from that old account, you’d know that I had an issue with moderating alcohol for 10 years. I started drinking when I was 20, and I couldn’t stop until I was 30. That was only after years of reading posts from this sub every day, and also reading books and doing research. I am well versed in the stories of “trying to moderate”... and then ending up right back in the hole you started in. When I was 30, I finally found the desire for alcohol fading... and I quit, mostly. I quit for a year and a month. I drank on a vacation, I posted about it, and you guys encouraged me to quit while I was ahead. So I did. I’ve even had a small handful of occasions where I drank just a little, and then didn’t again for months and months. For these past almost 3 years since I “quit”, I’ve really felt I’ve had it under control and had squashed my subconscious view of alcohol as a fun, good thing. Even when we have had it in my house every single day, I have barely ever drank during that time period.  

I am 32 now and I had settled into sober life, only drinking on occasion. And I mean, very rare occasion over that nearly 3 years since I quit in 2018. I began to honestly, deeply prefer myself as a sober person, in my right mind. And I think I still do. So I was able to drink here and there without falling back into the old binging habits, because I truly don’t desire that way of living anymore. 

But then, something happened last week. I was outside chasing a chicken, of all things, when I slipped. I broke my ankle- BADLY. Worst pain I’ve ever experienced. I’ve given birth with no pain meds, I’ve stabbed myself in the hand 2 inches deep and cut a tendon and a nerve, having to get it surgically repaired. But this injury is by far the worst pain I’ve ever experienced. My foot dislocated and my ankle went completely sideways and I fell and screamed and screamed. It was traumatizing! I had to have the injury surgically repaired a couple of days later. Honestly it has all been a complete blur and landed me completely bed ridden, a homeschooling mother of 3 who usually does everything for everyone else, having to rely on everyone for EVERY thing. And the pain. THE PAIN... it’s been a lot. 

As soon as I came home from the hospital and I took my pain meds and they weren’t enough, I felt it a reasonable time to drink alcohol. I drank on the day I came home from surgery. I’ve drank on many of the days since then. I honestly think that I will quit again... but I also felt I needed to finally come back and check in with you lovely people again. I still enjoy sober me better, but I am trying to relieve the pain. And honestly, it has helped.

The problem is that after reading about what recovery will be like- slowly regaining my ability to walk again after 4-6 months- I know the pain is going to last a while. And I need to draw a line at which alcohol is no longer a method of pain relief. I will need to quit again. It’s only been a week and 3 days since my injury, so I’m not too far in the woods yet... but I need you all to talk me out of using alcohol as a pain relief option. 

Sorry if this is a jumbled mess or repetitive or anything. I’m on pain meds and my brain is fried from the most physically demanding experience I have ever had. I’ll be glad if some of you will talk to me and make me feel better 🙂",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47966373}"

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello, hello! I'm excited to host for the very first time. I'm the early-to-bed-early-to-rise type, but I'm traveling, working on a cool project, and have been on my feet for 16 hours before crashing in a cozy hotel bed and getting this post up tonight. And I'm excited, because I came across the greatest quote for it this morning:

*Most people don’t grow up. It’s too damn difficult. What happens is most people get older. That’s the truth of it. They honor their credit cards, they find parking spaces, they marry, they have the nerve to have children, but they don’t grow up. Not really. They get older. But to grow up costs the earth, the earth. It means you take responsibility for the time you take up, for the space you occupy. It’s serious business. And you find out what it costs us to love and to lose, to dare and to fail. And maybe even more, to succeed. What it costs, in truth.*

*— Maya Angelou*

Sobriety is a thing that forces us to stop, turn around, and really look at our lives when the easier path is just to plod along, even if that path is leading us straight into an alligator-infested swamp. There are other things that make people assess their lives with this intensity - health diagnoses, divorce, love - but sobriety is the thing we all share here. It feels good to take up space with others who are facing ourselves and the world so bravely.

I will not drink with you today.  


Edit: Good morning! I am waking up with 5ish hours of sleep and heading straight back into work, so while I am reading as many responses as I can I can't respond to any at the moment. But watching you all pour in from this vantage point is bringing me an overwhelming sense of joy and connection <3 ",165,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5528613}"

My bf, sister and I went out to dinner with her at a taproom. I ordered a coke while everyone else ordered beers.. it really didn’t bother me, I’m at a point in my sobriety that I’d rather have an NA beverage and don’t get jealous of other peoples drinking anymore. But when I ordered, my friend made a comment that it was an interesting choice.. I decided to tell her I don’t drink anymore. She replied with “wow, nice.. why?” And I said I just didn’t enjoy it anymore and I was sick of hangovers and not being in control. And we chatted a bit more and then she said “ok, what’s the real reason?” And I said I told her the real reason. And then she turned to my bf and asked if it bothered him that I didn’t drink anymore and he (who is the most supportive) said “Not at all, I think it’s great” and she went on to say she would be bummed if her bf stopped drinking. She also made a joke about me not being fun anymore. 

It really sucked. 

I thought she was a good friend but I’m not so sure anymore. She always has a silly joking demeanor but those things actually hurt. I’ve done a lot of work on and for myself this past year and she really shut all of that down in about 30 seconds.

I think that’s really what saved me. 

Lots of inner monologue action - ultimately I thought- how could I give up on myself when so close to a hitting such big goal?! I really want to feel that victory of hitting 100. I would bargain with myself- I am not drinking with them at least til I eat something, now I’ll wait til at least after 5pm. Each time they had another shot- I had to have a little check in moment. I snuck out of the room and peeped this sub a couple of times. As the night went on drinking stopped looking as fun and tempting, and I stopped constantly debating.

The liver is the main organ that metabolizes alcohol, with the help of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to transform alcohol into a compound called acetaldehyde. Acetaldehyde, which has virulent effects, is immediately broken down into a substance called acetate. This occurs by a distinct enzyme called acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2).

Welcome to Shape Up Sunday, a weekly discussion where we share our hopes, dreams, wins, and losses for our diet and fitness goals each week. 

I'm all about public accountability as a booster on the rocket ship for my fitness goals. A huge reason I wanted to host this Spring Sunday Shape Up was to hold myself accountable and follow along the journey with others and see the SD community shine! 

Before I hosted the first session last week, my fitness routine took a significant nosedive. I was having trouble maintaining the discipline to get at least 30 minutes in a day - something I was CRUSHING last year. 

But guess what?! I'm baaaaaack! And it's been a GREAT reminder that it feels good to feel good!!

&#x200B;

>There's a quote by Louise Hay that I like to remind myself whenever I'm trying to create a new habit or move towards a new goal, and it goes, ""The point of power is always in the present moment.""

&#x200B;

Say I didn't workout yesterday, that's okay! I have right here and right now. I don't need to beat myself up over the past! I can do the best that I can at this moment and build out momentum from here. I suggest you keep this quote in mind throughout the next week whenever you're thinking about creating (or breaking) any fitness habits.

The weather in Texas has been gorgeous, and I clocked in over 25 miles on the trail this week, and I'm feeling fantastic! I'll take any excuse to get outside and undo the zoom room gloom.

A new habit I have created this week is doing a minimum of 15 minutes of yoga and meditation when I wake up, which has been a fantastic way to set the pace and boost my mood for the day. It helps me remember to take a moment to pause to respond before I react in all areas of my life. That's where I get into trouble when things get in my face, but when I can remember to take a step back and take a breath, things seem to go a lot smoother. 

I call my morning yoga practice my daily 'oil change' because it's all about the basics, joint circles, and just allowing all the tension to melt away.

I'm currently 7lbs away from my goal weight, hoping to hit that by the end of May. In terms of diet, I'm back to the basics and have eliminated excess sugar (bye-bye late-night ice cream), which is a bittersweet goodbye, no pun intended ;)

I love writing but the withdrawals are still making my mind a bit foggy. However, I realized you don't need to know my whole life story. All you need to know is that we probably have a lot in common, and that today I hit one week of no drinking.

I got back in to see a psychiatrist almost 2 months ago now and it turns out I've been misdiagnosed since 16 (I am 31 now) as Bipolar when I actually have Borderline Personality Disorder, so no wonder none of my treatments ever worked properly and I always turned back to self-medication (especially during the times when I didn't have insurance). So I'm back on (the right) meds now with added therapy to try to get my brain meat to do what it's supposed to do. Of course in order to do that I have to stop drinking 750ml of 80-90 proof depressive ever other night.  

I've been sick as hell since then, stuck in a cycle of being sick from withdrawals and feeling hopeless and sick from relapsing and hating myself, but a week ago something finally clicked. I don't know if it was because of the therapy, because of the strain on my relationship, or just because I got sick of being sick, but one week ago today I stopped TRYING to quit drinking, and actually QUIT. I had to take yesterday and the day before off of work because I have been so ill (I probably should have stayed home today too, but I already couldn't afford the 2 days that I did), but luckily my coworkers have been very understanding and supportive (maybe I won't be late all the time now!), as have my husband, therapist, and accountability buddies.

A little background - I work at a big box store, where I started in October. I've worked in restaurants for over 20 years (I'm a young 41 : ) but following a move to a small town in a new state, during a pandemic, restaurant jobs were basically non-existent, so I took a job working the customer service desk at the store that they based the TV show ""Superstore"" off of. The one that starts with a W and ends in a mart. I don't normally mention it, but for the purpose of this story - this is important. I handle returns, and in addition do all the money services - cash paychecks, wire money, cash stimulus checks - I deal with a lot of big transactions. Sometimes thousands of dollars. It's a lot different from waiting tables or being a barista, like I always have been, but I like to think that I deserve some credit for adapting as best as I could, and also staying sober since January 1, 2020 (yes, that is my sober date. I quit as the ball dropped, welcoming us to the year that would be 2020. Before this, my record was 30 Days. I'm at almost at 500 now : )

Alright, so.....

We have been short at the desk for over a week now, because the person I usually work with is out on a you know what leave (I got my 2nd shot a month ago. I'm ok : ) But seriously, it has been a lot, since I am handling a lot on my own, I have to get cashiers change, answer the phone, that literally almost never stops ringing - there is a lot coming at me at all times. I do the best I can, and keep getting more responsibility, so I think, I guess, that I'm not doing too bad. Ok, this is getting long, so I'm just gonna say it.

A woman called on the phone tonight asking me where she could find Chinese food in the area. I actually asked her to repeat the question, because I thought I was hearing things. I was in the middle of handling a transaction for a couple hundred dollars, and had like a line of 5 people waiting, a cashier asking me for change - you get the idea. I told the lady that I didn't know, but that there was somewhere maybe 10 minutes away. She asked me the name of it, and when I told her I didn't know  (I do. I was just annoyed. I am not Google maps, and I was extremely busy!) she proceeded to call back a minute later to berate me for not having more information about where she could find Chinese food, shouting that I am a very rude person (which is funny because everyone always tells me that I need to stop being so nice : ) but yeah, this lady asked for my manager on the phone!!! My manager laughed, we laughed together, and yeah - she told me that this lady said I was super rude. Which, I wasn't, but I should have been. 

Anyway...IWNDWYT. Coincidentally enough, my Husband and I got Chinese takeout the other night, and they put a paper menu in the bag, which is currently laying on our kitchen table, so I might take that with me to work tomorrow just in case, but - I will not drink with you today. 

P.S. I haven't even eaten in a restaurant in over a year. I should have just told the lady that lol",50,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47087094}"

I met *Wanda about 4 years ago at a job, she was working there as a second job and only a few years younger then me compared to the rest being 10 or more. For reasons unknown at the time she became very attached to me, we didn’t share hardly anything in common other then one hobby, not enough to label us more then colleagues. I definitely had other people there I bonded more to then Wanda but she kinda wiggled her way into the group and we let her. 
That first summer on the job I was turning 30 and put together a water activity and invited my coworkers including Wanda. Upon arrival Wanda informs us she can’t swim but she wasn’t required to have to swim this day. (I’ll come back to this). In the now 6 months since I started working with her I learned Wanda was essentially a 15 year old stuck in a 28 year olds body. This is why she clung to me, she has never succeeded in adulting. Summer ended, fall came wind Wanda left the job(she was pushed out due to her horrible performance). I met some new friends and work as well as a new s/o. 
The following summer we returned to the water for my birthday, Wanda came and this time brought important items like car keys with her instead of leaving them in the secured place with everyone else’s, fell into the water lost the keys and pouted the rest of the day about it like a toddler, plus carried on about how she could’ve drown. She was surRounded by 6 people who could swim and helped her immediately. Her attitude ruined other people’s day, we all had lost a lot of items but we were there for the day and trying to make the best. It’s a mistake that shouldn’t have been made and was just another note I jotted down in my brain about how she was becoming a thorn in my side that I didn’t want anymore. 
It was easy to avoid Wanda outside of summers, but as soon as the weather turned nice she’d be there like the ivy you can’t seem to stop creeping up the side of your house. My life kept me very very busy until my s/o passed away last Spring. 
I will admit I leaned on Wanda when others were sick of my drunken crying over my dead s/o, my drinking was out of control by then, but Wanda being the immature person she is enabled the behavior and then last summer started to copy it like it was cool to be an alcoholic or something, I started distancing myself even more from her after that. 
I got sober at the beginning of the year and have gone though some very positive changes. I have a great job and I serve on the side so I usually work 6-7 days a week and it’s not bound to change any time soon. But what is Wanda’s concern? When we’ll be able to do our summer water activities, how she’s been “gearing up” to hard liquor and wants to try other liquors this summer. That my cocktails are the signature piece of the day. When am I gonna have time for HER!! Not once has she stopped to think that may not work for me and my sobriety. In fact it seems to have flown over her head how serious my problem was! It was the main contributor to my s/o’s death!
Every time I talk to her or see her it’s about how she’s building a tolerance and she sounds like the(forgive me) loser in high school who will do anything to fit in even if it’s not the fit for the group. 
I need to dump her. I know it will be crushing for her because she’s incapable of seeing how immature and off center she is but it’s not my job to raise her and I’ve never felt close to her anyway. I don’t wanna be mean but it has to be in words a child can process.

It couldn't have been more than 20 minutes later (?) and the pain comes back ... stabbing AND dull ... just depends on where you'd ask me how it hurts. Stabs the front, feels like a sick, cruel cramp as it works its way into my back.

I get up and puke again ... I need the relief.  


Little better? Sure. Back to bed.

I repeat this a couple times, then realize: The puking is ""stomach-bug"" bullshit, but what's with this invisible sword through my **thorax**? Sheesh, man!

NO position is comfortable, but toggling between fetal position on the bed and fetal position on the cold bathroom floor is as good as it gets. Crawling gets me there.

After a few gnarly ancient food hurls, somethin' else makes itself known ... am I puking brown? Wtf is *that*? It's hot and brown ... maybe a little green? The fuck does THAT mean? Anyway ... back to fetal in bed. I'm glad my wife wears noise canceling ear plugs and sleeps with a noise machine, holy cow.

\*\*\*

It's 6AM and my wife is up and ready to dress for work. She asks what's been going on, brings me water, wipes my head off with a cool, wet rag ... tells me she'll call periodically ... puts the phone by my head and a bucket by my side of the bed. (I remember NONE of this.) She says I wasn't making much sense, but there was some kinda gunky brown puke in the bathroom wastebasket.

Fast-forward nearly 12 hours and she's back. The container she left me is overturned; there was darker puke in it. I was moaning and my skin didn't look right at all. Eyes wouldn't focus, breathing was out of control. Delirium.

She dresses me, helps me to into the car, speeds to the E.R.

There, they give me an Ativan because my breathing is 30 breaths per minute and rising. I'm dehydrated as HELL; they have to dig around in my wrist for a vein. I stare at it, CLEARLY not there because I generally freak over needles.

I remember NONE of this.

I could go on about the 16 days in ICU (multiple organ failure and whatever it's called when you choke on your own vomit when you're intubated), but it's neither here nor there. I'm here to urge you:

Watch for that particular pain and for puking of bile.  


It could be acute, alcohol-induced pancreatitis and people **die** of this.

This happened a DAY after I binged on an ENORMOUS bottle of Jameson I got for an Easter gift. I stayed up all night alone and chugged so much of it ...  *so* fuckin' much.

I never knew about this kinda death and would have appreciated the knowledge, as I'd have gotten to the ER way, way earlier and potentially avoided the kidney function that went down to 7% function. Ditto the dialysis scars, which are pretty evident and always garner questions.

Just ... please: Know the signs of alcohol-induced pancreatitis and **get to it** before it gets to you.  


I love  you guys, okay? I know this boat we're all in and if the oar I'm rowing happens to be this bit on pancreatitis, I'll strain hard to steer us sober with this in mind.

I first started drinking when I was 16, and though it started out being infrequent at first, it was always binge drinking. Alcohol was the first substance I ever used and it blew my mind because it almost entirely took away my anxiety, which was something I'd never had a break from before. Shortly after turning 17 I went through a period where I was binge drinking nightly for about a month. I don't remember specifics but I know towards the end I had enough of a tolerance I could have 10-12 beers in a sitting without blacking out. That ended only due to the fact I was entirely cut off from alcohol. I learned I didn't have to black out every time I drank around 18, and since then (apart from the occasional very emotional night or two) I generally drink with some degree of moderation. I started doing drugs at 17, and my mode of operation has basically to do something until I physically cannot take it anymore and it bites me in the ass (multiple severe psychotic episodes from psychadelic use, injuries due to other drugs, nearly being forced into rehab, etc). 

To cut my biography short, I've been sober except for weed and alcohol for the past 7 months due to a severe psychotic episode brought on from drug use, but I'm absolutely terrified of turning 21 and having free access to alcohol. My family has a history of rampant alcoholism, and given my own already existing history of dangerous substance use and addiction, I feel like I'm staring down the barrel of some sick fate I have no power in stopping. I know I could try to just avoid drinking altogether, but that's easier said than done given my age/situation/friendgroup/etc. I've tried to think of rules I could set, but I still feel like I'm just watching a timer counting down to a certain, particularly dangerous, addiction. I've seen the shit fuck up people's lives and I'm scared I'm going to just follow the same path everyone in my family has. Up until this point drugs have been way easier to get, so I have kinda defaulted to those. I don't mean to diminish the experiences of anyone else here, but in all honesty the closer 21 gets the more scared I am, and a lot of the advice I have received from people I've talked to about this has been pretty unhelpful. Do I just try to stay totally sober? Or is that more dangerous? Is there like, a good set of rules to have? I honestly don't know what to do. Thanks, and again I hope this isn't diminishing the experiences of or being condescending to anyone here recovering.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.67111456}"

For... almost no reason??? 

I know I need therapy and I’m looking into it, FYI..

It’s crazy bc people thing I just have a problem with alcohol. They don’t know I’m this absolutely raging, emotionally unstable, unintelligent (I don’t speak well when I’m angry) and crazy person outside of the alcohol. That’s why I waffle back and forth between “oh alcohol is my problem, so I’ll stop!” And then I stop and a week or two later I’m like “wow I am UNBEARABLE to be around.. maybe a drink will help” and bam, the cycle continues. Hence the need for therapy. 

I don’t even know where I’m going with this. Just needed to vent I guess. I’m frustrated drunk, I’m frustrated sober, I’m just frustrated and whyyyyyyy so I hold so much anger??!!

I’m sleeping better than I have in years. YEARS. 

I’m learning. I realized recently that I spent a long time pushing anything challenging out of my mind because I didn’t want to deal with it but not drinking has given me the strength I need to engage in self reflection. Not easy but necessary and good. 

I haven’t felt like a failure in weeks. I’m not a failure and it’s good to own that. 

I remember everything I do with clarity every day. I’m still a ding dong who does dumb shit on the regular but I know what I’m doing and why and I don’t have to accept anyone else’s interpretation of my actions. 

I could go on - less anxiety, productive at work and much better boss to my team, making some progress on my dissertation, getting along better with my husband, exercising regularly, etc. 

It’s not been easy but I’m amazed at the difference in just a few weeks. Seriously. Amazing. So worth it.

Now, this coworker and I grew quite close, and as smokers, we spent a good deal of time talking about life, and the struggles of addiction. I had just started my journey, and he had about 8 years clean time. He was one of my inspirations to go into inpatient. 

Now to this morning. My dad and I went to go and see him and his wife, (she also worked with us, and was the best shop mom, she constantly made sure everyone was included and felt appreciated.)
We got to the park outside their apartment,  and she came out to greet us. The coworker with leukemia was having a bad day, and wasn't cognizant, so we didn't actually see him.

This coworker gave his wife his first AA book, over 25 years old, with every one of his new clean dates, anniversaries, and struggles written in the margins. All through it, there is highlighted stories, little anecdotes throughout. It's honestly like looking through time, getting to live a portion of his story through shared experiences. 

I've struggled this year, and started the year off with a relapse, and like I said at the beginning, I have 100 days yesterday. This book represents 25 years of struggle, and the last 8 of it clean. He wanted me to have it, as a reminder of what is possible, that his struggle and triumph will live on. I'll make sure of that. 

Now as I type this, I'm flipping through the pages, trying to find where my emotions are, I just wanted to share. I'm not religious, but I have this feeling of keeping his legacy alive, to make his struggles all worth it. Thank you to all who take the time to read this.

It's a major part of how we spend time together; a few beers at a barbeque, a few cocktails at a bar. Pre-party before a concert, after-party whenever we have the time. We're a family of heavy drinkers, so growing up it just felt like a normal way to relate to each other. 

Recently I've had to own up to the fact that alcohol is causing problems in my life, putting serious strain on my personal relationships and a major factor in why I lost a job last year. With pandemic restrictions easing up in my area, my dad and I decided to go to one of our favorite watering holes for brunch, the first time in more than a year. For me and my dad, ""brunch"" is almost like a code; it really means ""brunch beers, followed by a stumble around the park before a risky drive home."" Stupid, I know, but that's just the playbook we've used for as long as I've been able to go out to the bar.

I was nervous to tell him I didn't want to drink, but with a lot of support from my girlfriend I finally worked up the nut to tell him in an email. He responded saying he was glad I brought it up, because he'd been thinking about his own relationship with alcohol and coming to some hard truths, same as me. We agreed we'd still meet for brunch, but stick to coffee. I was nervous he'd change his mind and say, fuck it one won't hurt. I was nervous I'd do the same thing, and convince him to have one with me. Nervous for both of us.

But, we just had coffee. It was different, but it was good.",244,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4881247}"

I am bipolar so sometimes everything can be a big deal. Today a lot of really small things have snowballed into one big one. I found in my mishaps first hand how even on a happy day, drinking just isn't fun anymore. It's depressing almost immediately let alone the next day. Lately even when nothing is wrong I find myself frequently talking about wanting a drink. Spring fever, so I'm told. I guess a lot of me still hasn't gotten past the ""you can't have fun sober"" parts of having a beer by the lake, a cocktail on the deck. I never do any of those things anymore, or dread them when I do. I have isolated myself in my home since Covid and rarely even go out and see these things but yet. It's all I can think about. So with my snowball of a morning I find myself sitting in the parking lot of my old bar (two cities away from where I currently live) posting this message. I won't go in, just sitting here soaking in the nostalgia of cigarette smoke and old men that smell like beer. I'm sure they are having fun in there? None of them ever seemed depressed as they b lined straight there after a days work and they have many years on me. I know they said I will always have urges, I think most of mine come from self harm or a way to black it out. But I also have a hard time getting over why you can drink and I can't? I know my life is better sober but figuring out how to be an adult finally is hard. I think about alcohol still at least once a day, mostly easily dismissed. Over the last few weeks it is consuming me. Spring fever I am sure is a large part of it, finally being able to comfortably outside and knowing that summer fun is to come. Everyone drinks, would it be easier to want to do these things sober if I had a sober buddy? My boyfriend stays sober and is so supportive but he wants to and it makes me feel bad. Of course, he does drink when he knows I am stable. Float trips and camping, days on the lake, all seem so annoying when I'm the only one sober.",2,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5682292}"

And eighteen days fully sober from both weed and alcohol. It's already my longest stretch in nearly 20 years. Here's some of what I've noticed so far.

I'm losing weight without trying. My bank account has more than enough to support me to my next paycheque, not counting the $200 cash I socked for my travel fund. I'm confident in every conversation, and motivated to produce (and produce above and beyond my normal standard) at work. There are no longer enough hours in the day to do all of the things I want to do, because I'm not wasting time being bored for boredom's sake.

I'm having long-overdue conversations with old friends and family members; I'm speaking from the heart and with intention. And I'm remembering what was said long after the fact. Speaking of remembering, I'm starting to remember things I haven't thought about in years: from my childhood right up to present day. I'm dreaming again, and remembering them when i wake up.

I'm reading more, keeping a daily sobriety journal, and the cravings are starting to disappear. It used to be that whenever I tried to get sober, one of my many triggers would inevitably trip me up. One time I made a list of all the things that trigger me, and it might have been faster to list all the things that didn't make me want to drink (lol). When those thoughts come up now (Hey! It's sunny and nice out! Maybe you should buy some beer to go with your barbecue!) they don't hold any power over me. Because I've finally seen the other side.

It’s like I found the cheat code to an easy, happy life, and of course it’s so simple.

Don’t be a depraved addict.

For years I’ve marvelled at all the ""normal"" people in my life—those who seem to be content and productive, flush with cash and eager to be social.

How do they do it? I wondered.

And the answer is just so laughably basic.

They had positive upbringings that did not lead them to addiction at a young age.

They had good relationships with their fathers and/or mothers, and developed healthy coping mechanisms for the world’s various obstacles.

I know it's still early days for me—I've still yet to experience real hardship in this latest attempt at getting sober. The real tests are still somewhere down the road. but I've never felt better equipped to face them. 

I've got too much momentum now to stop. My sobriety is a precious, invaluable gift that I'm giving to myself. Because I'm fucking worth it. And you are too.

  You guys are inspiring, in addition to reaching out on this subreddit I’ve also joined Annie Grace’s “The Alcohol Experiment” app to change my subconscious beliefs about drinking over the next 30 days. Reading the stories here are really encouraging as well.

A daily thing, every day began with a headache and wondering if I’d embarrassed myself or done something wrong last night. 

Did I get away with it again? Oh good....  now what do I have to do today? When can I have that first beer? Oh I can hardly wait for that first beer...

Then this thought comes in so strongly - “You’re done drinking, you’re quitting, that was your last beer last night.”

Goddammit Shit Fuck How the hell am I supposed to do that?  No answer. 

I didn’t plan on quitting that day. Oh, I had wanted to quit for more than half of my 25-year daily drinking spree. I tried a few times but it was clearly hopeless.  

But that day the idea came so strongly and unexpected. I knew I had to listen.  Plus the recent DUI arrest and impending fallout from that might do real damage to my life and relationships. 

The first year sober sucked, to be honest. I’m normally a happy nice guy. That year I was a cranky asshole, everybody agreed. 

Year 2 I started to find a new way to live, new thought patterns and emotions. I began to realize it’s possible to be sober and happy.  

So years 1 and 2 were a challenge. Year 3 started a new way of living, growing, interacting, and handling emotions.  My life has gotten better and better since year 3. More money, more friends, more fun, more sex, way better sex, a girlfriend that my wife knows about and likes. A job I’m so good at it’s all easy time and fun. 

But most of all I wake up happy to greet the day, and free of the crushing weight of last night’s drinking and tonight’s drinking. 

I hope you guys get to feel this way. It’s worth the effort. It’s worth any effort.

The thing that helped me not drink was doing my ritual for bedtime earlier. I went to bed a couple hours before I normally do. I took a shower early, put my pajamas on and brushed my teeth. When it was 20 mins to liquor stores closing, I was essentially ready for bed and would've had to get dressed and gone out with wet hair. That was a big deterrent.

No beer on a Friday night?!” And I just said “nope! It’s been a while. No more for me!” I think she was a little embarrassed that she brought it up or something she said “ohhh I see. You played it out. I do that with things sometimes 😔.” That in turn made ME feel bad for what I said!

Booze and has been really encouraging and seems happier when ever I walk into his store now. “Black coffee, water. That’s all I drink. You don’t need beer and soda. No good for you.” Is what he tells me when I see him.

She had a fever of 102 every night, and was miserable for nearly 10 days.  I took this ""opportunity"" to be unsupervised every night, and to drink more than I ever had before (and really, I was already drinking 2/3 of a bottle of bourbon every night).

One afternoon, I looked at my HBO app and saw I had watched 4 hours of a TV show, and had no recollection of it.  It dawned on me what a selfish asshole I was being.  That while my wife was super sick, I was completely plastered.  If she had taken a turn for the worse, I would have been completely incapable of taking her to the hospital and ensuring that my son was taken care of at that same time.  I became disgusted by myself.

Since then, I've quit drinking.  Told my wife.  I've lost 35 lb.  I have so much more energy than I did.  My days are longer.  I'm a better role model for my son.  And my wife doesn't look at me with worry and pity any more.

I am 100% convinced that if I had come into the pandemic while still drinking I would be dead now.  Instead, I have endured.  I have gotten the job of my dreams.  And I'm not ashamed any more.

I've been trying to get sober for 6 years.  I had several relapses.  But each time I learned a little about myself, and learned that my relapses start with a little voice lying in the back of my head ""You've beat this thing, now you can moderate again.""  I can't.  I only know how to drink one way, and that's drinking a ton.

I used to look at folks with big numbers next to their names, and think it seemed impossible.  But taken one day at a time, they start to add up.

Two years ago, I never would have been up this early on a Saturday drinking coffee and browsing the internet without a headache before my family gets up.  Today, it's just another Saturday.

For the past 28 days I have gained an understanding for why my brain is the way it is and learning basic life skills that I never learned growing up due to the lack of positive role models in my life. As bad as that sounds, these are skills that few possess and those who do could often improve upon them.

It's true what they say, that quitting drinking is the easy part and what's underneath is what really takes work. In the past 28 days, I have learned to be more vulnerable and how to form intimate connections with those around me. I have learned that under all that anger there are deeper emotions, and that those emotions are okay to feel and express healthily. I have also learned that, although I may not be able to control how I feel about something, I sure as hell control how I act on that feeling. Whether that be to cave and go grab a drink, get angry and yell, kick a Roomba or take a step back to think about how my actions will affect those around me.

I am very fortunate that I have the job I do, it covers most therapy treatments after being assessed with certain conditions and after been deemed a problem drinker (I say that with no malice), I was offered a spot on this course through one of the social workers I was seeing. Taking this course has been one of the best things to happen to me probably ever. I can't express my gratitude towards mental health nurses, psychologists and social workers enough.

Since quitting 8 months ago it seems like a lot of things have just fallen into place, what a coincidence right?! But I hit a wall in my recovery and became very frustrated, and my relationship was beginning to suffer tremendously. Through the work of the mental health team at the hospital and myself I have now flown past that wall and am on to better things. I have learned that I will always be in recovery, that there will always be new hurdles, and new successes. I also know that I won't be able to accomplish these feats without being sober.

 If I'm to leave with one piece of advice for anyone in this tough process is to seek and ask help from others. I did a lot of my recovery on my own, and while that is what worked for me I could not have gotten to where I am if I didn't reach out to someone with more knowledge than me about recovery. I pushed passed the fear of being judged by others and I am better for it. For the first time in memory I feel whole, complete, flawed but happy with who I see in the mirror.

2021-04-17 06:05:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mso2r7/my_story_31_days_later/,My story - 31 days later.,"Hi everyone. Firstly a note to thank you all for your support over the last few weeks - you’re an extremely welcoming and supportive group and I’ve really appreciated that connection since going sober. Today I am a whole 31 days sober.

I wanted to take a moment to share my story today. I had a rough day yesterday - one of the toughest since going sober - which caught me off guard as most days have been on the up since stopping drinking. I tried journaling last night before I went to bed because I couldn’t understand why I felt so low. As soon as I did, a weight lifted and slept soundly. As I journaled, I realised that part of my stress was down to the fact that no one knows why I’ve stopped drinking.

My last drink was on St Patrick’s Day - a big day here if you clock my username. I spent the day drinking with friends and when we all left to go home, I invited one friend to come back to mine and continue drinking into the evening. Earlier in the day, I had been rejected by a guy and so my feelings of loneliness and lack of self-worth were through the rough. I had invited this friend back - who is also gay - because I planned to make a move. I did, we slept together and I regretted it hugely the next morning.

I woke, hungover, upset and feeling all kinds of crap. Thankfully, I had therapy that evening. I had already been working through some big issues that were playing on my mind before that day happened. But when we discussed it, it was clear I had hit the “Fuck It” button. I had been rejected - so rather than feeling that, I binged, I smoked and I slept with someone just to sleep with someone.

Going sober, this group, therapy - it all did wonders for my mental health in the following weeks. I’ve been isolating a bit due to Covid so haven’t had many difficult situations where I’ve had to choose to be sober. I told my family I wasn’t drinking over Easter to try and lose weight and no one questioned it. A few close friends know I’m not drinking but don’t know the reason why. I’ve been to four AA meetings now but no one - except my therapist and a few people in another discussion group I’m in - knows this.

On top of this, the friend got in touch last week to say he’s tested positive for an STI. It’s unlikely I have it but I had to sort that test this week around work - an added stress.

Yesterday, it caught up with me. I woke sluggish and was unmotivated all day. I didn’t drink thankfully but nothing satisfied me. I couldn’t reach out to friends. I just feel like I have so much pent up right now. I can’t tell my friends that part of the instigator for my sobriety was sleeping with my friend - because they all know him. I can’t tell them about the STI risk because that implicates him. I can’t explain my struggles of keeping sober - because they all think it’s just a thing I’m trying out for a bit. 

I realised when I was journaling that if I’m to get through the barrier of telling people, I’m going to have to start somewhere. So here I am, here’s my story. It’s a work in progress but thanks for letting me share. IWNDWYT x",14,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46268612}"

I am wide awake feeling ashamed because I took today as a recovery day from all the studying and from a rough week at work. Now tomorrow if I do get to sleep before the baby is up I am sure I will be beyond exhausted. But despite all that I won’t be hung over. Even though sleep deprivation is just debilitating to me I used to voluntarily sleep poorly to stay drunk. Would wake up still drunk and literally reach/fall over my night stand trying to find a bottle that still has some alcohol in it. Just to get myself ready to walk to the fridge for a drink first thing in the morning. In order to start my day. I was truly out of control. Thankfully I am almost two years sober now. This night will pass tomorrow will be rough but I am expecting to sleep like a baby tomorrow night. I am glad that’s all it will be. I was just thinking the best decision of my life started with actually about 5 days of sleepless nights. I have no idea how I did it. Honestly if I want American and medical treatment wasn’t so crazy. I would have gotten sober under care. It was rough I remember sweating the whole night shaking. Not sleeping for almost 5 days in a row. Couldn’t hold anything down. But once I made it through I am in the best place of my life. As I mentioned I have a baby. Which I couldn’t be more proud of. I am doing well at work. And was actually able to buy a house in SD in 2020. I guess since I am so tired I am ranting. What I wanted to say is things don’t suck forever. If you’re going through your first hours sober keep strong. It will pass and you will be so proud when you make it to the other side.,4,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4703557}"

I own my decision, this is a setback and I reflect objectively this morning.

2. Drinking ruins sleep and recovering muscles from the gym because I am sore as hell today 
3. I am groggy, my mouth is dry. I have been fresh every morning since I stopped

I was very proud of myself not drinking for 12 days. I need to stop seeing this as a scoreboard and reflect hard on why I want this.

I have had many dances with sobriety and for so many reasons. My drinking ""issues"" were mainly weekend binge drinking which is ""normal"" here in New Zealand. I didn't really touch it during the week, probably because I kne I could never stop at one. But come Friday night, I was unstoppable. However, it became scary, not knowing how I got home, losing belongings, one time I woke up in hospital with no idea how I'd got there, I'd walked home by myself numerous times, ended up at people's houses at ""after parties"" coming to with no idea how I got there or who they were, sprained ankles etc. I'm honestly so lucky that nothing ever happened to me as a smaller female wandering around by myself.
I tried AA, there were some things about it that I liked and a few things I didn't. The main thing I liked was the real-life connection to people, so I thought I might put myself out here a bit more in the online world to gain some more connections.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Saturday! It's my last day with you and the theme for today brings together a lot of what we've talked about through the week. 

When I was drinking and even in the early days of sobriety, there were lots of things I wanted to change about my life/myself that I couldn't deal with at the time. Now that I'm sober and it has become easier to manage my sobriety, I've had the capacity to make some of these changes, bit by bit. 

For example, I have known for a long time that I would switch to a plant-based diet, because it was the right thing for me. In the past it felt like too much to deal with, but over the last few months I've slowly changed my diet one food at a time until I reached my goal. I've also given up caffeine (this has generated a much stronger response when I've told people!)

These are things I wanted to do that I could never have done while I was drinking. I had all the resources at my disposal, such as books, films and recipes but I wasn't able to use them yet. The all or nothing approach and the emotional highs and lows that accompany drinking aren't really conducive to making lasting personal improvements. 

If we don't think we are important enough to take up space and we think, 'Who am I to be doing this?' then it's difficult to start. 

When we're trying to be perfect, it's easy to give up because of a setback. 

If we have no way to self-soothe and feel we can't talk to anyone about our struggles, it's hard to deal with the stress and disappointments of the journey.

If we ignore what our gut is telling us we are missing out on all the clear signs of what is right, or wrong, for us.

And if we worry endlessly about what *might* happen, we drain ourselves and delay taking the first steps in making positive changes in our lives. 

These obstacles to personal change have been the themes for the week. Each one is something we can work on, bit by bit, to help us to build a solid foundation for change and create the lives we want for ourselves.

I would bet that at least half of us have tried to make massive changes before, all in one go. 

Has anyone ever tried to give up drinking, smoking, junk food, start exercising, stop scrolling, stop bingeing TV, keep in touch more, get up earlier, study, start a hobby or some combination of these all at the same time? How did that work out?

We can be impatient and look at others thinking, 'How have they done it when I can't seem to?' But there is no secret that would make everything easy. The key to lasting change is chipping away at our obstacles and our goals even when it's not immediately clear that we are making progress. 

When we are unsatisfied with our lives, slow progress can seem like it's not enough, but there is true joy in the process that I hope everyone gets to experience. 

Question

What were you/will you be able to change because you're no longer drinking? What small thing can you do today to chip away at your goal? 


It has been a pleasure to host this week and read all your comments and stories. As I was reading, I was thinking that each 'IWNDWYT' came from someone with a whole life that is completely different to mine, with your own struggles, challenges and things to celebrate.

I'm sorry for this long post but this is a beautiful community that I'm so grateful for. I've learned so much from so many people in this community. I'm so grateful for everyone's wisdom and honesty that I feel indebted to share truths I've learned that I have found helpful...but ya know...feel free to throw it by the wayside if it doesn't work for you. Because what works for me might not work for you. 

A friend of mine asked me how I felt about my sobriety and I told her this. The other day I couldn't fall asleep until 5:30am. And while I was trying to fall asleep I thought about how when I was ""deep in it"" I would often wake up paralyzed with anxiety and shame because I knew I needed to quit. I knew I was digging my grave but I just didn't know how I was going to stop. The thought of not drinking honestly struck panic throughout my body. And that night I couldn't fall asleep because all I could think about was how grateful I was that I finally did. 

I've thought a lot about what ""flipped the switch"". Obviously it wasn't one singular event or one profound light bulb moment. It was a buildup of things that finally led to a moment where I had had enough. 

One of the most important things I've learned about sobriety is this...a lot of people in general but especially those who struggle with addiction spend a lot of time stuck in their sadness and anger about all the random, awful, and unfair things that has happened to them. But the point at which you have decided that you have had enough and that you are going to sink yourself into your wellness, you also realize that the person hurting you the most is yourself and likewise... the only person that can heal you is you. 

The second part of that is this very unfun truth - Part of the trick to getting unstuck is being painfully honest with yourself. For a really long time I couldn't understand my drinking. I thought that just by acknowledging things that had happened and acknowledging that I was upset at someone or something I was working  through my crap. I found that if I could understand why something happened or why someone behaved in a certain way it would take the sting away, which isn't totally untrue. However, what I often skipped over was simply allowing myself to feel and work through my ""broken heartedness""...and I dont about every one else but there was a lot that had broken my heart. 

Being honest with yourself means giving yourself space to acknowledge and FEEL all those negative emotions that we all hate to deal with. They exist for a reason. They are trying to tell you something and the more you try to quiet them the louder and more unbearable they become. Sometimes just letting the truth hit the air kills it's power. I know that's been true for me. For me the more time that went by and the more layers of shit I had to work through it felt as though if I pulled curtains back and looked at all of it , if I really dealt with the reality of my life it would just crush my soul. 

But guess what??? SURPRISE! I'm not nearly as weak as I thought I was and I was NOT crushed under the weight of my ""broken- heartedness"". In fact I have found the more I choose not to drink and deal with my problems the stronger and more emboldened I become. It allows me to actually live and not just survive. Is it easy? Hell no. Is it worth it? Hell yes. 

I hope that when you struggle, when you feel like the beast is going to swallow you whole, that you remember how unfathomable it once seemed to you that it would ever be possible for you to put the bottle down. I hope you remember those moments and then find yourself in awe that you found it in yourself to stop. Wield that power and slay the ugly beast. Look that son of a bitch in the eye and tell him he can't have you. Not today  He's a damn liar and you deserve to be happy and live your life in peace. 

I have by no means been perfect on my journey. In my first month of sobriety my youngest sister died from a drug overdose 1 day shy of my first month of sobriety ( and no, the irony was not lost on me). 3 days after her funeral my grandma died. 2 days after that I started a new job...talk about mood swings. I was a woman who previously could drink a 5th alone. I was throwing up several times a day and had even began throwing up blood. There were days I couldn't imagine even going an hour without drinking. I also knew that none of the people who loved me could save me or would confront me...and to some extent why would they when I largely struggled in secret? You best believe I thought I was a lost cause. So imagine my surprise when I discovered I could get through of all of that b.s without numbing myself. 

This journey is no where close to being over but I am so happy to be on it.

Thank you again to everyone in this community who is willing to be honest and vulnerable with their story. You never know when your story is going to be part someone else's foundation to heal themselves. To everyone else who is still clenching that bottle, I hope you can finally get to a place where you can allow yourself to have peace.

I have avoided AA meetings (even though I do find them helpful) and even avoided this sub in the past month or so because I'm not really thinking about alcohol much lately.

I'm scared that somehow reminding myself of alcohol every day is counterproductive? Could make me more likely to slip? 

I'm also scared that maybe that's not the right way to look at it, and perhaps I need reminding so I don't forget why I quit in the first place? 

It feels very nice to just move on and enjoy living my sober life without constantly thinking about recovery. 

I also don't want to be stupid and irresponsible. I know how insidious this addiction can be.

I just wanted to share this because I know the thought of quitting for good may seem unrealistic to some. Start small-1 week, 1 month...1 day. Don’t make any lifelong promises right away, just set a goal and experience sobriety for a little while and stick to that short term goal.

I was a lurker on this sub for quite sometime before I stopped drinking - actually, now that I think about it, I lurked on this sub before I even created an official Reddit account. Although it took some time for me to make the decision to stop drinking, each of you have a played a role in me getting here. Thank you for sharing and baring your souls for the greater healing of us all.

So…where to start?

I had a rough childhood, with an extensive amount of all types of abuse, and a family full of alcoholics and addicts. My parents were really young when they had me, my mom was 16 and my father was 21. I had to take care of myself a lot, and when my sister came along when I was seven, I had to take care of her too. I grew up fast. Unfortunately, growing up quickly meant that on top of taking on adult responsibilities, I also spent a lot of time with older friends. My transient friend groups were, on average, of 5 – 10 years older than me. As a 14-year-old partying with 19-24 year olds the majority of the time, I quickly developed an insatiable desire for alcohol, and was drinking a fifth of vodka a day by the age of 17.

I’ll be honest, the years between the ages of 15 and 24 are very murky in my memory. The short of it is that I drank myself sick constantly, engaged in toxic and inappropriate relationships, got addicted to heroin, was homeless, landed myself in federal prison, and still continued to use heavily and pursue abusive relationships when I was released. I remember thinking to myself countless times in my early twenties that I was likely going to die by the time I was 30 or spend the rest of my life in and out of jail. Sadly, I had accepted those outcomes because I didn’t really know what I could do to change the trajectory. I thought that was the hand I was dealt. Fortunately though, while I was hopeless, someone else had hope for me and helped me to turn my life around.

When I was released from federal prison, I was on supervised release for five years. My probation officer during the period of supervised release was the one who helped me to get to treatment in 2009. Thanks to her, I experienced nearly 9 years of awesome sobriety from alcohol and other drugs. So many amazing things happened during those years. I got knocked up by my boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and had my beautiful daughter, we bought our first home, I went to college for the first time at the ripe age of 28 and got an associates and bachelors degree within three years. Then, I found out I was pregnant with my son while I was in the middle of my masters program. I finished my masters degree, we sold our first home, and bought our second home. I continued to excel professionally; I received several promotions over the years. I mean damn, those 9 years of sobriety were incredible. So much amazing good-real-life-shit happened. It was so good, that I convinced myself that I could most likely drink like a “normal” person now.

And the lie detector test determined: that was a lie. It started off like many of you have shared before. At first, I was able to control and moderate, but that only lasted a few months. Then, I picked right back up from where I left off more than a decade before. I spent two years trying to convince myself that I was okay, that my drinking wasn’t a problem. But it was a huge problem. I even experienced my first DUI. I drove home completely black out drunk and rolled my SUV over a hill. My BAC was .26; I’m lucky that I didn’t hurt or kill someone. That was in February 2020, right before COVID shut everything down.

After the DUI and the onset of COVID restrictions in 2020, my drinking really spiraled. I was working from home, the whole family was at home - all day every day, and I numbed everything with booze. I put on 15-20lbs and generally felt like shit most of the year. I didn’t work out, play with my kids, I was in my addiction so deep that looking back, it seemed almost like the twilight zone.

Towards the ends of last year, I was spending days in bed after a heavy binge, depressed, suicidal. My work was suffering. I wasn’t available for my kids. I was slowly killing myself with alcohol. But here and there I started to get some clarity that I could not continue to live like that anymore. Then, I started reading this sub more frequently and went to a psychiatrist to talk about my mental wellness. Once I slowed my drinking and started stabilizing my depression and PTSD with medications, I was finally able to enjoy my first sober day again on January 2, 2021.

Fast forward just a few months and my life has improved so much that I feel I won't accurately express it in words to you today, but I’ll give it a shot. I’m back to the REAL me – the one I knew for many years of sobriety before. My relationships have all improved (imagine that), my patience is on point, my family and I spend meaningful time together, I practice yoga every day, workout consistently, I’m working towards my Phd, and I just got offered an executive position at a local nonprofit that does incredible things for our community. We are thriving as a family, all because my husband and I put down the drink and started kicking ass in life again.

Here’s what I know: when my substance use disorder is active, I know that I am not my true self. Knowing this, I must be extremely cognizant of the little voice in my head that tells me I can just have one, just have a couple, only drink on Fridays, only drink on the weekend, no drinking until 5p, okay maybe a sip in the morning to stop the shakes…it’s all a false narrative due to my condition. And in order to maintain the remission of my condition, I must make a decision each and every day not to partake in the use of alcohol. The one thing that keeps me accountable to this is when I pledge my accountability on the DCI. It has been the number one most powerful motivator for me to keep my promise to myself and you that I will not drink with you - just for that day.

I am so grateful to this community, and all of the mods that keep it rockin and rollin.

I struggle more being around alcohol, than I did when I first started getting sober (which I feel like is bizarre). Not sure why this is, but likely because I am forgetting how bad alcohol was making my life. That’s the constant reminder I have been telling myself to get through- of late.

So many times it would have been so easy to just go to the bottle shop and treat or console myself because I've ""earnt it"". 

I got through the Aussie summer without having my favourite beer. I got through the traumatic death of my eldest cat and the recent major health issues of my remaining boy without drinking. I got through hypomanic, severely depressive and extremely anxious episodes without drinking. I've experienced anger without alcohol which has been uncomfortable but liberating because I know that I am justified in that anger and I can consciously do something about it. 

I got through the realisation that my family of origin will never support me how I need to be supported. They're a 'fairweather family' for me and I'm only useful or of value to them if I can make them feel better. 

The only thing my Mum has said she is proud of me for in the past six months is when I tell her I'm still sober or that I've lost weight.

Last night I decided that I wasn't going to tell them about my milestone. They don't get to decide what is a legitimate or worthy success in my life. They miss out on the opportunity to know about this because they have never supported the other choices I make, such as starting a math gang with my neighbours because we all have dyscalclia, spending time with my two very supportive friends (who are seen as less important because they cannot work due to their disability). 

When I would visit with family, I would buy a bottle of vodka to keep in my luggage that I could secretly drink in order to be able to face them and keep up the facade that I'm ok. I've been doing that for 15 years, and to them I only drank a couple of glasses of wine. I would stay with my sisters so I could drink more. I would take extra of my prescribed stimulants to attempt to avoid sounding slurred or hungover, blaming my hand tremors on them, and too much caffeine. I would blame my bloated abdomen and nausea on an endometriosis flare up or my IBS. 

I am extremely proud of myself and I shared that fact with my neighbour and my friends and they were genuinely proud of me. They haven't struggled with alcoholism, or addiction, but they have the emotional intelligence to know that if I am proud of it, it is something worthy of praise and celebration. It wasn't a perfunctory ""congrats"" that comes from a place of ignorance (because you shouldn't be addicted in the first place, or as a defence because they are suddenly uncomfortable with their own use). I accept and appreciate their championing because I know that they are good people who love me for the person I am, not how I make them appear. 

It was wet and cold while my neighbour and I did the 5km walk together this morning and it was so nice to be able to appreciate the time I spent with her. I wasn't hungover pretending everything was fine. I wasn't mentally checked out thinking about having to go to the bottle shop later. 

What helped this time (my longest time sober in 15 years) was the fact that I wasn't afraid of alcohol like I was the other times I got sober. Usually it was precipitated by a stint in a psych ward. I'd come out being triggered constantly by advertising and the drinking culture in Australia. I was doomed from the start because I gave the power to other people to keep me accountable and shielded from the temptations. 

This time I radically accepted that alcohol can and will always be present in public spaces. So I chose to not be afraid of ""slipping up"", because I gave myself the choice to stay sober. I make that choice subconsciously most days and consciously on others. I am accountable only to myself, because that is who I am hurting the most by drinking. I was self harming by drinking as much and as frequently as I was, and it was only a matter of time before I fucked up so badly that there wouldn't be any choice anymore. I choose to stay sober so I can show myself, my cat, and the people I want to have around me love and kindness. I finally have a choice that I can make about myself without guilt or shame for needing it.

It was physically the worst thing I have ever experienced, and I pray that the memory of that day continues to stay in the front of my mind if I ever think I can can control my drinking again.",14,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9382431}"

As I was feeling a little low energy today I asked for a non-HIIT work out today. Our energy levels matched today so that was good. 

Anyway, he asked me what I had planned for the weekend. I responded just some chores and relaxation for the rest of the weekend. 

""No drinking?"" the PT asked.

""No. And it's just over two weeks since I gave up coffee."" I replied.

Was Day 3. I was actually doing ok besides being depressed, irritable and lonely.  Then my day went to crap. Nothing seemed to be going my way and I was a mess. Once I made the decision to drink, my anxiety went away.

I’m in a Banned Drinkers Register (voluntarily), so legally I cannot purchase takeaway alcohol, so I asked an employee to buy some for me (I said I left my ID at home). I took my kids out for dinner, so I could have a few drinks there too. I do remember the first sip of wine was divine, but I didn’t actually enjoy the glass. By the second, I was back to my old mind frame.

I was still irritable, and my kids were being naughty, so I lost my patience. We went home. I had lots of bags of their stuff that I was struggling to get upstairs, and as I placed the bags on the kitchen counter, I hear a crack. The bottle of wine broke, and filled the bag with wine. As I’m trying to get the bag to the sink, wine spills everywhere. The kitchen is a mess, the kids need to get to bed, and I realise my beds sheets are still on the line as one of them wet my bed last night. I end up lying on my mattress, staring at the ceiling for about 15 mins, wallowing. I really wanted that bottle of wine.

I manage to get up, clean the kitchen enough, make my bed, get the boys to bed, and reset my counter on here.  One of them didn’t want to sleep, so I decided to lie in bed with him, mentally and emotionally drained, where I fell asleep.

I’m so over this. I want to be sober so I can be healthy, but I know I’m relying on being fit and healthy again as fix for the issues in my life. But I know that’s not going to magically solve everything, so why can’t I just keep drinking since it does make me feel short term pleasure.

My patience was tried at every single opportunity. I do food deliveries right now and got stuck at two separate restaurants for 45 minutes EACH waiting on orders. I had customers texting me asking why their food was taking so long, and I felt so miserable knowing their food was getting cold even in my hot bag, but there was nothing I could do. I got stuck behind a slow driver everywhere I went; if one turned out of my way, another one turned right in front of me to take their place. I called it a day after it took me all three hours of the lunch rush to get four deliveries done. I was defeated and doing everything I could to not just chain smoke cigarettes.

I've been battling with the water company and my landlord about my outrageous bills for almost two months, but I've been stuck being the ping pong ball in their game of corporate cheapskate bureaucracy. I was supposed to get statements from someone who came and looked at my meter, but he's just completely dropped off the face of the earth since he left, no statements to be found.

I needed to get something from a friend for another friend's birthday tomorrow and they didn't answer my texts all day, like eight straight hours.

Yesterday was really hard. I felt like I didn't exist in the world. I felt like everything about my existence is worthless to everyone and that nobody extends to me even a modicum of basic respect. I was pushed to a mental limit I haven't been pushed to since the day I decided to quit drinking. And it felt even more poignant that it happened on day 300, like the universe completely wanted to ruin the day for me. I love my big round number days, and 300 was kicking me while I was down.

But instead of turning to alcohol as I have done before so many times, I just went scrolling on Reddit. And I found a board that I had never seen before or even considered existing: r/MangaCollectors. I've been reading and collecting manga since 2008 when I was 13, and I've always cherished it. It's the only thing in my life that I collect and plan on never parting with. So I posted my collection, excited to be able to share it for the first time literally ever with other people who could appreciate it.

And I found out that little teenage me had some good foresight and bought some copies that are worth a lot of money now! I was up until 2am googling the value of my collection, just laughing in absolute fucking glee.

Yesterday was a day, y'all😂😂

I was headed in a positive direction there for a bit. And by a bit I mean a week but a week is a week! I had 3/7 sober days and actually strung 2 days back to back. Might not seem like much but it was a decent improvement. I felt alright. Life just became way more real and overwhelming. My emotions were all over the place. I withdrew into myself. I’d say that my depression and anxiety actually increased. 

Then I just fell back into my “old ways.” Drinking to excess. Stopping to get beer right after work and having a roadie on the way home. Finishing up a 6 pack and heading out for more. Watching the sunset at least, not that I remember them all. Sigh. Waking up hating myself, parched, trying to get myself functioning by taking a morning shower (I’m a night shower kinda guy), barely choking down coffee, starving myself all day, eating greasy shit at night. Ugh. 

I really despise who I have become. I’m fat and bloated and slow. I don’t have energy and I need it for my job. My memory is really shot. I can kinda function on autopilot but it’s getting harder and harder. My anxiety and panic points are real low, doesn’t take much to set me off. My eyes are just hollow. The bags under my eyes are extreme. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. 

My life is getting busier and busier and I need to be taking better care of myself but I’m just not. I don’t know that I even know how to, to be honest. Or I do for one day and then just give up the next. It’s almost my birthday and I just don’t want to live like this. And yet I am. I’m consciously making the decision to keep living like this. Living a lie. Trying to seem put together. I am so not. I’m so lost and afraid and alone. 

I’d reach out but I feel like everyone’s heard it before. I drink. I get down on myself. I wallow. I use others as a sounding board. I pick myself up for a day, or two, and then I’m right back at it. No one wants to keep hearing about that shit. I’m letting myself down. Don’t need to add others into it. Maybe it is time for a meeting...

I’m a very high functioning alcoholic. I drink a lot of wine every night. I own my own business and come from a family who is also in return all alcoholics. I guess you could call it generational trauma at it’s finest. 

I do love some drinking culture as in a huge foodie and love wine. But I also use it during the week as an escape instead of dealing with my own emotions. I’ve recently been diagnosed with CPTSD from my own traumatic child hood (I go to emdr therapy every week and take meds my therapist knows about my drinking habits). I seem to drink mostly when I’m triggered. 

I wake up feeling awful everyday and I truly think that it holds me back from things in life that I would enjoy if not feeling hung over all the time. 

Some weeks I’m able to kick my habits and I’ll do really well. Others not so much. Weekends are always a drinking fest (I do love a good brunch with mimosas). I want to not drink during the week but I’m finding this impossible unless I quit all together.

2021-04-16 15:12:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/msa8ge/over_my_first_big_hurdle/,Over my first big hurdle.,"Hi guys! 

I'm brand new to the group and to reddit. I just joined so I could have some people to talk to since nobody else in my circle is sober.
I'm 10 days alcohol free. Over the last week I certainly passed up a number of times I would have drank- after work beers with my husband (who's still drinking,) a few glasses of wine with a friend, etc. but last night was my first real challenge. It was my friend's small intimate birthday party, and I was the only person not getting wasted. 

When I've taken breaks from drinking in the past I've also usually stopped going out. This is good for working on my own projects, but it's ultimately not sustainable. It's only so long before I miss my friends, then with socializing comes booze again. I really want my sobriety to stick this time so I'm trying to make myself do all the things I would usually do but without a drink.

The party started out alright, but everybody got buzzed quick. When they suggested shots, I poured a shot of juice and still partook in the birthday cheers. Then they played a drinking game from our childhood. I played too, substituting soda water. It felt a little silly but there was no one else at the party that wasn't playing so what else was I gonna do? A few times my mind started saying ""one wouldn't hurt"" so I stepped away and distracted myself on my phone until the urge passed. 

I'm feeling really proud of myself for getting through it. And I stayed the whole time to show love for my friend's birthday, and then I gave everybody a sober ride home, which felt good.  My only concern is, it really wasn't fun. It wasn't fun being on the outside while everyone else was drinking, but it also didn't look fun on the inside either. People stopped making funny jokes. My husband started a really stupid argument with some equally drunk friends. Everyone was kind of hollow-eyed. Honestly it felt really lonely. 

I guess I'm reckoning with the fact that maybe the time I've spent getting drunk with my friends hasn't been as charming as it seemed at the time. I really love these people and don't want to lose them from my life, and I'm sure over time it'll get easier to be around people drinking without feeling tempted, but after last night I'm not really interested in doing that. 

I know I just need to relearn and recenter my social life so alcohol isn't such a pillar, and I know that takes time. It might be possible to convince these bartender night owls to do something sober during the day occasionally. 
I really don't want to be a preachy or condescending sober person, especially since I was blacking out 2 weeks ago. I'm just reeling from my eye-opening perspective last night, and feeling really disgusted by booze, and with my own relationships that have always relied on it.

I'm realizing I might have a bigger problem with alcohol than I admitted to myself, and it's not going to be something I can slip away from without a pretty big restructuring of my life.

I wanted to share that I'm going through a hard time recently. Over the weekend, I broke up with my partner of two and a half years. I've never been happier in a relationship before, and this was my first totally sober relationship -- from beginning to end -- in more than a decade. I had high hopes, and I dreamed of a life together.

I'm going through the grieving process now. Most mornings begin with a crying spell, as I wake up from turbulent dreams focused almost entirely on him. After a time, I get moving, and I force myself to go through the day.

I have to tell you: this last year has been tough. Right now, I'm managing a team of twenty people at work. I'm supposed to have three managers to help with that, but it's just me. I do my best to support them and keep the team afloat. I'm as much emotional support as I am a manager. I serve as a sort of ad-hoc counselor, discussing everything from work issues to relationship stress.

The good news is that a lot of people are showing up for me in this difficult time. It's a stark comparison to where I found myself five years ago, when I first began my journey into sobriety. I was drinking heavily, lived in a depression den, and had few, if any friends that I interacted with on a regular basis. I was alone, and I thought of suicide almost daily for more than a year.

To say that I am sad would be an understatement. Grief is the right word. I am scared, but I am not without hope. I am afraid that the psychological wounds that led me to drinking in the first place will never fully heal, and maybe that they will prevent me from ever finding happiness.

But I can't let myself think that way. It's just fear. It's the cacophony of negative voices in my mind trying to tear me down. The truth, though, speaks for itself. When you look at my life now compared to where it was, the transformation is undeniable. I may not be fully healed yet, but I \*have\* healed.

And as the grieving process moves ever onward, I will grow stronger and wiser from this experience. One of my employees, whom I counsel, called me an ""old soul."" I took it as a compliment.

Redemption. It's the process of taking all the pain and transmuting into something good. Every wound I carry with me, every blow I've taken, strengthens my empathy. I can relate to others because I've been there. My life is a tapestry of conscious experience, and it grows ever more detailed.

I had my starts and stops including 3 trips to rehab before I got it. I think what changed for me was finding true acceptance. I could see I had a problem but my ego and pride wouldn't really accept it and tried hard to find ways prove I didn't. My acceptance of it came after a 4 day alcohol and drug binge where I found myself standing in front of the mirror, feeling like I should be dead and for the first time I just stared into my own eyes for a good 10 minutes. I was crying and realized I couldn't hide from me, I couldn't lie to me, I hated myself and yet, I loved myself. All the things I learned in rehab and AA came flooding back to me and I knew being sober was the only real choice I had if I wanted a future. That's when I truly accepted and became totally okay with being an alcoholic and getting sober. I would say that moment is the most pivotable moment in my life. That acceptance changed the direction I was headed.

2021-04-16 14:26:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ms9bk3/short_trip_on_struggle_bus/,Short trip on struggle bus,"At a cheer comp in Florida with my daughters gym which means a whole lot of forced socialization and interactions including staying with a large number of other families in a condo complex.   These interactions aren’t my strong suit and normally were dealt with by binge drinking for three straight days.   I’d blocked this trip from my mind as much as possible and wasn’t super worried about it till I walked into the condo.   Ocean, beach, and lots of memories of previous parties with these people hit me in the feels.   


I had to do a lot of soul searching and centered myself to get my mind right.   I felt weak and a little scared but thought it would pass.   Fast forward to a grocery trip and watching everyone in our group load down their carts with alcohol and mixers.   It was like watching them prepare for a college frat party.    One family last even had to admit they had forgotten to get anything non-alcoholic for their kids and was borrowing soda.    Part of me was very annoyed by this behavior but another part mourned the loss of being a part of the party.  As the night went on, everyone is getting a little loose, and words are slurring.  I’m really missing being a part of it at all.  For the first time in a year, I really truly felt like I was missing out and wanted a drink so bad.   


For some reason I decided I need to just face it head on and offered to bartender for the other couple we are staying with.   I got a very perverse satisfaction from opening a bottle of crown and watching myself pour it into a glass.   It felt dirty but good at the same time.   Not to be perverse,  but it’s almost like catching a glimpse of a coworker of friend’s wife’s exposed body on accident.    You know it’s wrong but you look anyway.  It’s a little bit of voyeurism to be honest.   

The urge to drink was the strongest I’ve ever felt but I stayed focused on my number and the thought of seeing it go back to 1 was the only thing that held me steady.    

I managed about 3 hours around everyone drinking and actually managed to enjoy myself most of the time.   

I went back to room a little early because I got cornered by one particularly annoying drunk and just wanted to get away.    I went to bed relieved that my sobriety survived and today I don’t have any urges at all so far. 

For me the moral of this story was that I am NOT cured.  I am still an alcoholic and still want to drink.    Some times I want to drink a lot and some times not so much.  I still haven’t figured how to be perfectly at ease with myself without a drink but I’m better today than I was a year ago.    The reality of never drinking again feels like a foreign concept some days but I know for me it is the only way.    It is the only way not to go back.

I was a blackout drunk with a bad temper, and I used plenty of other substances alongside alcohol. The thing that I remember the most about the week when I finally realized I had to get sober was the combination of misery- that my life was a complete mess and I couldn't stand my own company- and fear that I wouldn't be able to have ""fun"" if I stopped drinking and using. Just thinking about the contradiction in that combination blows my mind. I had made such a mess of my life that I couldn't face the day without drugs and alcohol, but I couldn't imagine how I'd live without them either. I'm not perfect, but now I like myself enough to spend time alone. It's not just the lack of hangovers, or being able to remember what I did last night, although both of those things are a big deal. It's that I don't have to erase everything I feel now, when I make a mess or speak in anger, I apologize and do my best to clean it up... and I make so many fewer messes now that I'm able to pause when I'm angry or sad. I don't view other people as tools or hurdles, and in sobriety I haven't once woken up next to someone and not been sure how I got there. 

AA was the thing that made sobriety stick for me. Meetings, big book, sponsors and sponsoring- the whole thing.

Yesterday marked 8 months sober for me. It has been a heck of a ride, and I want to thank this community for all the solidarity and companionship that I feel because of it.

I wanted to share one regret that I had, and that is that I didn't tell my spouse that I was struggling sooner. She decided to stop drinking about 16 months ago, and she was able to pull it off. I was able to go about 3 weeks with her at first and then I crumbled. But I crumbled secretly. And so began 7-8 months of me hiding my daily (and starting earlier and earlier) drinking. The shame built up more and more each day, and with that my inability to tell her grew and grew. I kept trying to stop, but couldn't. it was a terrible, lonely, shameful existence. But I couldn't tell her - I suppose out of the fear and shame that was piling up.

When I finally broke, on August 16th - yes she was mad - I'd been very deceitful after all - but she immediately launched into 'support mode'. I went to rehab for 45 days and came back a broken (but sober) person. I came back to a hurting relationship. I came back to confused children.

But. In the end: our relationship made it. We worked through some tough issues (and continue to - we're not done yet). I've battled many personal demons. Life is so much better. I'm so much better. My marriage is 1,000,000 times better. work is way better.

That is an unexpected gift that came with Dry January and beyond. It's crazy the work that went in to ""managing"" a family, a career, a band, school/school board committes, coaching my kids and an alcohol addiction that I had been nurturing since high school in the mid 80's. I did not know what it was like to be sober. I figure my longest stretch would have been the 5 or so days for antibiotics and even then I drank wine when I would start to feel better. For a few years now I was trying to not drink during the week so sometimes 4 days, 3 or 2 days, but fuck yeah Friday, which easily turned into sneaking shots Tuesday just to stabilize. Then right back at it. It was not even a double life, it was one big logistical puzzle, difficulty level expert. It was hard keeping up with myself, but I knew the checkboxes that needed to be checked. And they got checked. 

Now without the demands that alcohol put on my time, my energy, my concentration and my motivation, I am free to follow through on all the plans I had in my head while being too drunk/hungover to follow through. Some were stupid, some long forgotten, but others great! I have the time and the energy to pick and choose.

My kids are 9 and 6. When they were born I said to myself I would do anything to take all the pain that they will ever get and deal with it myself. If I could take all their hurt away I would do it. Well, by making this choice they do not have to grow up with a drunk Dad. They do not have to become adults with all that baggage they would be bringing with them. They are my motivation.

Heading into my 15th sober weekend, I have plans for myself as well as for the family, some are busy plans, some are chill plans, but I know I can trust myself to follow through on them. Or not, but that would be out of choice. And my wife and I are laughing together, really laughing, for the first time in a long time. Baby steps.

""Drinking made him happy, and that made him angry. As he refilled the glass for the nth time tonight, soberness was the only thought in his head. Giving up drinking entirely seems like a great idea when you're drunk. When the moment is a turmoil away from the ordinary. After the weekend, he was gonna get a grip. He lied to himself, but it felt good.""

I've been sober for over two and a half years today. But I needed to read this note to remember how even in a state of drunkedness, I was often longing for sobriety. Back then, going sober was another one of the pipe dreams that alcohol brought with it. Drinking would give me moments of artificial gung-ho. Mental blocks would momentarily give way and let me imagine life differently. And I apparently imagined it without the drink.
But with alcohol, ideas like that end up withering away in the daze of hangover. Or worse, lead to ill-advised actions that only end up hurting myself or my loved ones.

Reading that above passage I was reminded that even as a heavy drinker, I was longing to be sober. And now that I am, those other ideas and dreams of betterment seem a lot more plausible.

I'm a petite female (in my 40s) who'd been drinking for over two decades. This is the first time in years that I've gone a week without a drop of alcohol, and I feel better than ever. 

TL;DR: I think naltrexone saved my life

I started drinking heavily around the time of the 2008-2009 crash. My employer went bankrupt so I was out of work, but the biggest catalyst was when I found out I was pregnant and then 15 minutes later in the ER, found out it was an ectopic pregnancy and I had emergency surgery. We weren't even trying to have a (second) baby, but I still mourn that loss.

I have a history of depression (pre-drinking), so I was also self-medicating.

Working from home all these years made it easy to drink all day. I went from maybe 2-3 drinks (mostly wine or vodka/gin cocktail) every couple of days or on weekends to 5 a day (7-10 on my worst days). I blacked out a lot. Most of my past is a blur. I hate myself for the times I drove intoxicated with my kid in the car.  

A few years ago, a blood test revealed ""slightly elevated liver enzymes"" and the doctor offered to do an ultrasound right there and then. I declined; I didn't want the bad news. She referred me to a GI doctor, who I never went to.

In the meantime, my belly was swollen. I gained about 20 pounds. I had a constant pain in my right side. I'd jerk in my sleep. But I was functioning well at work, and since most of my friends are heavy drinkers, few people seemed to notice.

I'd tried cutting down or quitting several times, but couldn't make it past, like, 3 days.

Then last August I hit the breaking point. I drank so much on a Saturday that the next morning I went into withdrawal. My hands were shaking so bad I couldn't lift my fork to eat (not that I had any appetite) or raise my glass to drink. I was exhausted but couldn't sleep. Over the next couple of days, I had the night and day sweats, I heard voices and music like there was a radio on in the other room, I started having panic attacks. So I forced myself to drink to get rid of the shakes and went to see a doctor.

He was going to put me on naltrexone, but because of my w/d symptoms, he referred me to an addiction specialist instead. My liver enzymes were higher than they were four years ago (ALT was the same at 58, normal is 5-40; AST went from 52 to 119; normal is 9-40). An ultrasound showed fatty liver, but no signs of cirrhosis, which was what I was most afraid of.

I went onto MDLive to get a prescription for natrexone, after reading about the Sinclair Method. I didn't see much change (I started the pills in September). At my last followup in Feb. with the online doctor, I admitted I was still drinking daily and he said I should've been improved by then. 

And then two weeks ago, I had one drink in the afternoon and an alka seltzer because I was feeling crappy, then I threw up on an empty stomach. For the rest of the week I had between 1-4 drinks a day.

A week after that, I was reaching for my glass of wine and my brain just stopped me from drinking it. I felt repulsed. Same with beer. I had to force myself to finish the glass of wine.

My husband came home with two bottles of wine and I didn't even look at them. He continued to drink beer (I hadn't told him I had stopped drinking) and I wasn't bothered or tempted in the least. Right now, I'm sitting by our home bar, stocked with gin, vodka, and whiskey, and I feel fine. 

I know that this feeling might not last forever, and I need to stay vigilent. But I'm just amazed at how this drug finally kicked in. And I know if I ever *decide* to drink, I can take the pill before doing so to continue the conditioning. But since the pill makes drinking not pleasurable, I don't see the point anymore.

Also, one of the side effects of naltrexone, for me, was depression. I got to the point where I was having trouble getting out of bed—I just didn't want to—and I was tired all the time. So I really wanted to stop taking it, but I needed to stop drinking first.

The only withdrawal symptoms  I had were stomach upset the first few days, itching, and a headache that persisted through yesterday. My skin has even started to clear up and I look less bloated.

the person who is able to go about their day and not think of having a drink until 5-6pm will have a much easier time quitting because their days didn't revolve around drinking. but that's only the mental aspect. i think your bodies aren't as physically dependent on the alcohol as someone who drinks all day.

i gave my body hardly any time without alcohol, it was 12 hours at very most. so basically only when i was asleep and a few hours in the morning and an hour or two at night. the nightly drinker, however, gives his/her body nearly 20 hours to recover and maybe even goes a day in the week without drinking at all. there will be little to none withdrawal symptoms in that case.

I’ve actually thought through a lot of my friends and can say things like, “Well, we can still get out on bike rides together” or “I don’t need to drink when we get together to play board games” but this friend - our friendship is almost entirely built around breweries and beer. He was the first real friend I made when I moved to this city. I know he’ll be happy and supportive of me - he’s a good friend - but our identity together is simply beer. As much as I’m worried about the impact of all this on my marriage, this one might actually be harder!",14,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41709673}"

Both the good and the bad. The good is that we are all witty people who love laughing, making others laugh. We are bright and articulate. We are generous. We are most often kind, and rarely judgemental. But on the bad side, we are alcoholics, with all of the drama that comes with active addictions. My mom, my dad, my brother, me. Not a designated driver in the bunch.

My brother is, as far as I know, in recovery right now. He just did a 6 month stint in jail for an alcohol related charge and is now living in a halfway house for addicts. I'm 20 days into sobriety (this time) because I can't stand living like this any more; can't stand the anxiety, the guilt, the shame. I can't stand feeling like my life is just passing me by, half remembered and often regretted.

My parents still drink though, daily. They are retired and drink from morning to night. They worry about my brother and his alcoholism, but it's like they have blinders on to their own, and to mine. We're okay because unlike my brother we are mostly functional. We don't get arrested or DUIs, or lose our jobs or our families (yet.) But really the only difference between us and my brother is that we are able to ""maintain"" a little better (so far.)

I have always had a special bond with my dad, and I was talking to him yesterday about how I had quit drinking, and why, and what I was doing. And for once he didn't turn it into a joke or otherwise blow it off. He mentioned that he is going to be 60 next month, and that he can't sit around drinking beer for the rest of his life any more, that it will kill him sooner rather than later, and that he wants to live. He said that he hadn't had a drink in a week himself and that he was thinking about keeping it going indefinitely. I'm proud of him, and promised to support him, just as he promised to support me. I worry about my mom because I don't think she's there yet. I worry about my dad living with my mom because I know this would be so much harder if my husband was a drinker.

This has been become a bit of a (positive!) habit for me. When I first started out on this journey I'd go buy the local shop out of sweets, chocolate, crisps, ice cream and cans of pop every Friday. It helped stave off the weekend booze cravings.

I've toned it down a little now as the weekends aren't quite so scary, plus all the sugar definitely wasn't helping my fitness goals. I still like to get a few treats in though.

Here's why my new outings kick my previous 'getting the drinks in' habit's butt:

1. I spend like £10-15 on soft drinks and snacks vs the £40-60 I'd easily spend on booze.

2. What I buy lasts me into the next week, rather than having to run out again when I'm inevitably out of beer by Sunday lunch time.

3. I can walk to the shop now and incorporate this trip into my exercise routine as I'm not carrying a couple crates and bottles back home with me.

4. The obvious one, I don't spend all weekend (and Monday) in a hungover/drink-through-it cycle.

5. I enjoy my weekends and gladly spend time with my family (even if the little one wakes me at 5am - no risk of still being drunk).

Sobriety absolutely rules. It is not easy, and still early days for me, but what I have gained from just two months is immeasurable. Above all else I am happy, genuinely happy and content with being alive for the first time in a long, long time.

Throughout university I was a pretty heavy drinker, as many are. I loved to party on weekends and have wine with dinner during the week - and its effect on my academic performance was astounding. 

I remember having a hard time learning in uni, which was a big difference from high school. Of course uni is harder, but I had a harder time concentrating, I procrastinated endlessly, I would read a whole paper and have no idea what I just read. I woukd open up my readings and just scroll on my phone instead. 

Why did I have such a hard time concentrating? Probably because I was usually hungover to some degree, tired, or both. One semester where I drank a lot more than normal due to a bad breakup, I ended up dropping two classes so I wouldn't fail them (taking only 3 classes that semester!). Overall, my academic performance in university was mediocre, with a mix of As, Bs and Cs. 

Since being sober, I've had a much easier time learning, to the point where I find learning enjoyable and stimulating. In the past 2.5 years I've learned some programming for data analysis in SAS and R, massively improved my understanding of french, powerBI and excel, and generally excelled at work, where I learn new things every day.  

My brain just feels clear 90% of the time now. The difference is shocking. I wish i could go back jn time and do uni sober, so that I coukd have gotten a good scholarship to a masters program (which my grades were not good enough for).

I’ve been drinking the stuff for 16 years - graduating from weekend sessions downing 10+ Utah 3.2% natty lights bought with a fake ID to 3-4 daily craft IPAs and Belgian imports on a weekday and 10/day on the weekend. For a while, I considered myself less an alcoholic and more a connoisseur. But over the last two years, a voice in my mind I’d hear every morning grew from a whisper to a shout. “You’ve got to stop. You look like shit. You’re always tired. And you act like an asshole.” But it didn’t matter. I never WANTED to stop drinking alcohol. 

In December 2020, my wife and I bought a Peloton. I know it sounds ridiculous, but something about those classes made me want to show up everyday ready to go spelunking into the pain cave and compete on the leaderboard. But I knew the alcohol was holding me back. If I was going to be able to perform at my best, I needed to get the alcohol out of my system.

So, on Jan 3rd, I stopped buying anything alcoholic. Now, I relax with a few non alcoholic beers like (craft IPAs from Big Drop Brewery, Leffe 0.0, Stella Artois 0.0, etc.) and an occasional puff from my loose-leaf vaporizer. 

I feel GREAT now. My skin has improved tremendously, I perform better athletically and at work, I’m more present, and I’ve dropped a ton of extra body fat from the booze. And - say why you want about cannabis & NA beer- I don’t feel like I’ve had to make a negative choice. The cannabis helps me relax and sleep well. And with non alcoholic beer, I can enjoy all the nuanced flavors of a regular beer that I love, but with 1/4 of the calories and no health impact.

My drinking had been out of control for a while, and I wasn't going to argue with anyone that said it was. I didn't care. I figured everyone in the world was miserable, so why was it a big deal if I was miserable too and as a bonus got to be numb in the process. But holy fucking shit I was so wrong.

My second year of sobriety hasn't always been easy, but the rewards of stopping have really started showing up. I moved out of a sober house in June of last year. I re-enrolled in college last fall after dropping out 6 years prior. My GPA was a 4.0 last semester and it's looking like that might actually happen again. I'm not a genius, I'm just a drunk who got a new lease on life. I adopted a dog in November and she's helping me learn to not be so focused on myself all the time and care deeply for other people.

But I think the biggest test of my sobriety this year was both my roommates had relapsed. They will be moving out at the end of this month and I will be having two new sober roommates moving in. As a wise person posted on this sub back when I only had a few days ""Sobriety doesn't solve my problems, it makes them *solvable*."" We are all different people with different interests and personalities, but we are bonded over the common denominator of alcohol being the source of a lot of pain. I'd be lying to you if I said the thought doesn't come up every now and then, but I am at a point today where I can rationally see my life is so much better without it.

So, here's to another year without it. This wasn't my first time trying to get sober. If anyone here is just starting over or feels like they don't have a lot of time, fuck what anyone says. Where you have 1 day, 1 year, or 40 years, we are all one drink away from starting the pain all over again.

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's nearly the end of the week! I had some time off last week so I thought it would be tough getting back into the swing of things, but Friday seems to have come around quickly. I've also been worrying about some important matters but so far my worries have been unwarranted. 

This got me thinking of all the worrying we do about things that never come to pass. I try to worry less now and trust that whatever happens, I'll be able to handle it. 

At the start of my sober journey, I worried about whether I'd be able to do it, whether I could cope with life without alcohol to take the edge off and whether life would be no fun. After my first 30-day experiment, I had planned to moderate because I was too afraid of a life without alcohol. That did not work out. 

Even when I had decided that sobriety was the way to go, I was worried about missing out and things I'd never be able to do again. The absolutes were scary. 

As it turns out (no doubt with Covid as a factor) I've not missed out on anything in the last year because of sobriety. The longer I am sober, the less alcohol seems like a key component of activities like gigs, meals out, weddings and festivals. I'm actually looking forward to doing those things without alcohol, and seeing which parts I am able to enjoy more, and remember!

I was really looking forward to my weekly wine session. At first it was nice, I watched a movie with my SO and got a buzz. As usual, she went to bed and I kept drinking. But before long I realised it was kinda shit. I was too drunk to read (which I love to do at night), too drunk to play videogames, too drunk to really do anything productive at all either, except listen to music or podcasts. That's all well and good for a while, but pretty soon I realised I was just kinda bored. I mean, I can listen to music and podcasts/youtube without being drunk, and now just for that mediocre night I knew I was going to feel like shit the next day (which, of course, I did). Several times during the night I thought 'is this really worth it?' Because of course it isn't. I ended up drinking less than usual and went to bed feeling cheated. I'd poisoned myself just for a couple of hours of unproductive nothing. So dumb.

2021-04-16 01:19:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mrwi29/maybe_i_am_an_alcoholic/,Maybe I am an alcoholic,"Hey everyone, I’ve posted here a couple times very recently about how I was diagnosed with non alcoholic fatty liver and that I also binge drink heavily on the weekends. Every weekend, for about the last 1 1/2 years, I drink about 30-40 drinks total, or units of alcohol I guess.

A “big” reason I drink this much is because I’m very tall and also very heavy so it takes a ton just for me to feel drunk. I realize now that just because I was getting to the same level of inebriation as my much smaller friends, my liver was still a normal liver and still had to process that huge amount even if I wasn’t anymore drunk than the next guy.

So, like I said, I had been diagnosed with fatty liver about three weekends ago after going to the ER for upper right abdominal pain and just feeling like shit. It scared the shit out of me even though it’s very mild fatty liver. But even after I got the diagnosis and spent every day that week after asking doctor Google everything I could about fatty liver, getting myself all worked up, I went and binged the next weekend.

I also binged this past Friday night and after I woke up I had that upper right abdominal pain again and went to the doctor for another visit. I was worried I may have hepatic encephalopathy, cirrhosis or even liver failure among many other things I googled. My doctor assured me that I’m fine but that he wanted me to stop drinking if I couldn’t significantly cut back and moderate. 

He asked me a question no one had ever asked me before; “do you think you can quit on your own? Be honest with me”. I told him I could and I could see the worry in his eyes. It was at that moment that I finally considered that I may have a serious drinking problem.

Now, after all the ranting, i come to the reason why I am making this post tonight.  Tomorrow is Friday and I will be hanging out with my friends, who also only drink on the weekends, and I know it’s gonna be hard to say no. So, as I think about how I am going to handle tomorrow night, I have been trying to find out how fast mild non alcoholic fatty liver progresses when you binge. Thinking that I still have some weekends to get wasted before shit really hits the fan.

What the hell kind of thinking is that??? Is getting wasted THAT important? I know it makes me loose and have “more fun” but Jesus! Then I went further down that line of reasoning and asked myself “how do I choose which weekend I stop at?” and the sad fact is that I’d probably heavily drink until I have another health scare and then I might not be as lucky that time.

I guess I just needed to get all this off my chest and ask you guys how you think I should approach the weekend. People have said that I should avoid my drinking friends for a bit but they are my only friends. I know I can’t have just 3-4 so I’d rather have 0. This is gonna be a real test.

So we hung out a lot more and have drank a lot of beer and gotten closer. 

Well his grandfather was my other next door  neighbor and he just passed away last week. When it all happened I walked down to see if I could help the family in any way. My friend and his brother who is also one of my best friends Were outside. He lives one street over and is a super interesting dude. 

They were on the porch smoking and I walked down and struck up a convo with them their stepdad we were talking about fishing and she just interrupted the whole conversation and said “Hey I wanted to tell you I’m so proud of you for quitting drinking and getting help.” 

It brought tears to my eyes. Her ex husband and my friends biological dad is a horrible alcoholic. He drinks close to a gallon a day and has called my buddies and told them what horrible sons they are and she has dealt with god know how much more. 

Hearing her say that took me by total surprise I didn’t know she knew I had a problem. Tonight we had a small little campfire pickin and grinnin and after we got done playing the brother said “hey man I am sorry I told mom about you drinking. I know you told us not to.” I told him how happy I was that she knew and said something to me it made me so happy. Turns out both of my friends have all dialed their drinking back because of what their dad has been doin so it’s been beneficial for us all to have each other for support. 

We stayed up till midnight planning what my wife calls a “man date” every Thursday we all go to dinner together at our favorite bbq joint.

I've heard a couple of songs that I hadn't listened to since I was back in that isolation and it really brought me back, and when I look at where I am now and where I was almost 8 months ago, I honestly can't believe I made it out of that. I would used to come on here and look at all the people who were so grateful about being sober and I'd be like ""fuck you, all I want to do is drink how can you say sobriety is good"" and I guess I'm riding a pink cloud right now but I'm gonna ride the fuck out of it cuz I'm just extremely grateful to be sober today.

I think deep down it was from cravings and the fact that I was getting bored of sobriety... my head would just grasp for excuses. It started with strong occasional feelings of ""I wish I could drink without it becoming such a problem"" and then now progressed to actual drinking.

I had some girl trouble a few weeks ago.  I went to a friends house to talk it over, but decided to have a beer. Ended up having one beer and 3 hard seltzers. Felt bad about it the next day and then noticed my cravings were substantially magnified for the next week and a half.

Then yesterday, I was going to the bank and just decided to stop at the bar. No reason, just did it. Almost entirely was because I simply wanted a beer. Had two and then went to the store later for 2 25 oz cans of Twisted Tea. Had qualms in the middle of drinking the first twisted tea so stopped. This morning, I finished the drink and then had my other can. I then quit drinking again and hope to remain that way.

It wasn't fun. Felt sickish almost the entire time and was left with that dizzy afternoon drunk feeling....awful- smelling and tasting the alcohol vapors that reminded me of the dysfunction that I had experienced up until last August. Literally nauseated by the thought of alcohol right now. I don't ever want to go back.  But I told myself last time I wouldn't drink again and that didn't last very long.

This obviously contradicts my January results somewhat as I drank until Christmas in Dec - I'm not sure what was going on - perhaps I was drinking less in Dec.

All I can take away from this is that everyone is different and going to see different results after they quit. It may take a month. It may take months. Perhaps even longer.

I'd say the most interesting part of this is that my doctor never once told me to stop drinking or lighten up. He even said he doesn't think my drinking is affecting my health during one of those Oct/Nov meetings. He could be right - could be unrelated - but I know I'm best staying away from alcohol, even if it's only for the mental energy I've saved.

2021-04-15 22:47:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mru7v5/scared_about_my_future_persona/,Scared about my future persona,"I’m 11 weeks pregnant and haven’t drunk for 19 weeks. I’m defo not at any risk of drinking during pregnancy or breastfeeding, that just isn’t going to happen. But I’m getting really scared of who I am going to be once all that is over. 

I was always a beer-drinking, pub loving gamer who loved Friday drinks and going out to old pubs. It was usually “craft” beer, never got into wine or other things except the odd experiments. All that has obviously just stopped now (except gaming). Even before the pregnancy with lockdown it slid away until I was a one night a week drinker and then I managed to cut that night out too in January. Lucky for us we got pregnant after months of trying, and actually it was after my first month of 100% no alcohol.

So the part that’s scaring me is who am I now and who am I going to be? Everyone just knew me as this pub going drinker type, and I made friends who were also into that culture. I get a lot more confident and I suppose outwardly “fun” socially after a drink and that’s undoubtedly been a crutch (unless I go too far and crash out or something, not such a fun laugh then). 

Luckily that scene is not really my SO’s style so I don’t have to struggle there. He does drink, but it’s not really been such a big scene for him as it was for me. I just sort of feel like an empty shell and underneath me, without booze, what is there? It doesn’t help that I can’t do some of the things I love due to pregnancy or lockdown anyway. Winter sports, surfing or motorbiking etc - it’s all stopped and that was a big part of my persona too. I guess this might be normal pregnancy feelings, but once the baby is old enough to stop breastfeeding then I’m just wondering what am I going to be except for a mother and obviously wanting to care for my child the best I can? How do I find out who I really am after over 20 years of alcohol playing a big part in that?

I know I would never be an every night drinker anyway, horrible headaches and cystitis would soon kick in, and drinking was usually a social occasion thing... but even then I have often gone too far and ended up regretting something I’ve said or felt horrible the next day. I would also be terrified to ever be drunk in front of my child and I won’t be that person. 

This means I am going to have this big area of my life where I just don’t divulge anymore, don’t hang out with the heavy drinker friends and don’t go to work dos at the pub etc. I guess that’s also just a part of motherhood and responsibilities and growing up. I’m just having some sort of existential crisis feelings about who is this new person going to be? 

I look at my partner and he’s just sat there seeming so content in himself, happy just existing and living in the moment, not drinking too during my pregnancy (I didn’t ask him not to, he just stopped when I stopped, maybe he never liked our drinking nights anyway). I’m not assuming he’s like that, I’ve even asked him what is it like just to sit there without worrying or obsessing about something, and he said his brain just does it without trying to. 

I just wonder if I have some personality devoid where I get so intensely bored and have to cling onto some activity or something to feel like “someone”. This may make no sense at all, but essentially I feel like I’ve become a shell of a person who has no real deep personality or redeeming factors at all. It’s like stripping away the beer that I’ve been using as this social crutch through life in social occasions, underneath I just feel sort of “unformed” and empty. 

As an aside I’m absolutely sick of everyone at work and social media and WhatsApp talking about beer. It doesn’t help that I haven’t told anyone yet (other than medical or SO) but since the pubs reopened in UK literally every time we have a meeting or something, someone brings up the pub. “Have you been to the pub yet?” etc. I even had a senior in a call today saying he was so shocked not many people had been and literally telling us to go to the pub at the end of the call etc. It wound me up beyond belief how much he was pushing it but what can I say? For a start a lot of us aren’t vaccinated yet anyway. And it’s eventually going to be easier for me to sidestep the pub question since I have a new “reason” not to go (not that I should need one!) but I hate that assumption that everyone is going to be gagging to get to the pub. Sit there in the cold outside, paying a fortune just to have a beer. Sure you can drink something non-alcoholic but people aren’t all clamouring to sit outside Greggs with a can of coke are they. This is all about the drinking culture and pushing booze that I have come to be aware of. I don’t know, it’s just making me extremely angry right now. And anyone on that call could be a recovering alcoholic or just rightly not drink for any other reason. Insensitive IMO.

Maybe it’s pregnancy hormones but I’ve really really felt some confused and angry feelings lately. Also I came off Zoloft during pregnancy, and I have either been on that or Fluoxetine all my adult life for OCD and anxiety about things I’ve done or intrusive thoughts. So I’m not going to lie, this last few months have been a struggle mentally. And I don’t know how to start to make it better but I want to sort this before I give birth. I have had therapy in the past but nothing really stuck, and I felt like the ones I went to just let me have the confidence to excuse anything wrong I did in my life.

I am aware how I’ve been feeling and acting so ungrateful and entitled lately too. I think I just dislike the concrete location I currently live in, and I just want to live a more wholesome life by the sea in the country where I can get out into nature and be someone I want to be. But that’s a way off so I have to look internally first.",5,{'lockdown': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.45082474}"

Maybe a glass of wine or two for special occasions, but I never ever want to feel hungover again!

Some history - I struggled with opiate addiction for most of my 20s.  Finally got my act together and quit, but I still smoked pot, drank a few nights a week and would occasionally take mushrooms or do some molly.  I didn't consider alcohol to be a problem of mine but looking back at the amount I was consuming on a weekly basis I most definitely was not consuming it on a healthy level.  What's funny is drinking was so hardwired to my lifestyle and thinking like I couldnt enjoy things without a drink!  I remember after I got pregnant the first time I went up to my dad's lake house I felt so left out because everyone was drinking heavily and I was sober.   After over a year of sobriety I realize that life is so much more rich when I'm not nursing a hangover and can actually remember the events from the night prior.

I think having a baby definitely played a part; alcohol has lost its appeal also because it makes me drowsy, and I really don't need any help in that department.  But I need to be on my a game for my daughter, and I have never felt so healthy in my life.  I'm still over weight from the pregnancy but I'm able to exercise for hours without getting fatigued.  I remember suffering through 10 minute runs after a night of drinking not long ago!

This is a bit of a rant but I kinda just need to write it somewhere

I feel different than most posts I see here, I never feel the need to drink during the week.

Drinking has always been a social thing for me. Being alone far from home with the whole pandemic has really increased my need to be social and that’s where this has all stemmed from.

Typically I’ll drink on the weekends and be good until the next weekend. 

Well, that’s been *a lot* of weekends in a row now, and each time I get more and more drunk.

I walk every where so I never have to worry about driving so I let a bit too loose but my god I don’t even remember getting home half the time.

What was supposed to be “imma grab a few beers” turns into a full throttle night out 99% of the time.

And honestly? That was fine, I had nothing better to do than be hungover on Saturday.

That was until the hangxiety started kicking in. Never in my life have I felt such overwhelming dread and uneasy ness. I would stay sober Saturday and still feel it Sunday and not be able to sleep. Fall asleep for a few minutes then wake up in a panic with my heart racing, rinse and repeat until work.

This sleep cycle normally lasts until Wednesday night I can finally get some normal sleep.

I’ve had this since around November and I never knew it was caused by the drinking until recently. I don’t know why it triggered then but No body ever told me this is what a drinking problem felt like, I was not prepared for this mental abuse.

There have been a few times since then, I can go out, have a few, and have a normal weekend. But the times I slip up are too frequent and I can’t run this risk of feeling this way.

I have plenty of friends that know their limits and know when to stop, and I envy that so much.

I took a few weeks off and it was boring but it was doable. I had something to do this weekend and figured I could handle a few, well....we can all assume how that ended. So here I am again.

It’s not that I need to drink.
It’s just that I want to but I’m not good at it and that’s a painful reality.

I’m too young to be having these issues, I’m going to miss out on a lot by trying to stay sober but it’s a unfortunate step I have to take.

I wish I could kid myself and go out and stay sober but that just sounds...horrible.
Maybe down the road but right now I have to make a sacrifice to help myself long term.

Maybe I can find a sober way to socialize, but in my experience that’s not how it ever works out.

I wish I could go out and be physically cut off at a certain point and I think I’d be fine, but it doesn’t work that way.

Idk, sorry for the rant just kinda needed to say that.

(23, F). Growing up, my dad was a huge alcoholic, still is to be fair. He drinks every day mostly to get away from pain and trauma, and once he starts he drinks for days, even weeks or months. He usually drinks until something really traumatic happens that he does and then will quit for quite awhile. And then when he quits he goes through heavy withdrawals that can be really hard on his health. There’s usually a period where he is sober and then gets back onto the drinking again. My mom on the other hand is very opposite, she’s never drank to get away from life or as an escape. Always for fun out with family or to enjoy a nice evening. She never drinks twice in a row, she’s very calm drunk and happy. She usually doesn’t over drink either. 
Then there’s me. I’ve drank since maybe 15-16, only ever for fun or partying. When I’m drunk I do have the problem of not knowing my limit and that’s carried on until now really. Once I start drinking I can get really drunk and I’ll just keep going until I blackout and I forget a lot when this happens. I never drink out of anger or loneliness or pain, just to have fun like my mom and most people.  I’ve also never went on benders or had withdrawal symptoms. I have however made a lot of drunken mistakes due to not knowing my limits and have hurt people in the process. 
I’ve always kind of wondered if I’m an alcoholic because I don’t know my limits? What classifies someone as one? Is it genetic? Sorry if this is a dumb question.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50104547}"

Hi friends, 

It’s been a long time since I’ve checked in. I’m still sober. 1 year, 9 months, 14 days. 

Today I heard from someone I love very much. We went through some dark times together years ago. I had never met anyone as kind and genuinely good as this person. I still haven’t met anyone kinder since. 

My friend is struggling with drinking and the depression that comes with it. It surprised me because alcohol had never been their poison of choice, but it got me thinking about just how pervasive alcohol is and how **fragile and precious our sobriety is** and how **we need to protect it at all costs**. Sometimes that means ruthlessly cutting out of our lives the things, places, and people that are toxic and threaten our sobriety. For me, it meant moving away, losing friends, changing jobs, starting fresh. 

Lately, I had been flirting with the idea of drinking again. Romanticizing the years I wasted being, well... wasted.  *“Just a couple of beers. I can handle it”* and *“One glass of wine. No harm,”* were some of the lies I had been telling myself these last few weeks. It’s so easy to fall into the trap and so hard to crawl out of. All it takes is one drink. 

There’s a text written by Oswald Chambers called “[Beware of the Least Likely Temptation](https://utmost.org/beware-of-the-least-likely-temptation/)”. It reads:  

“You may have just victoriously gone through a great crisis, but now be alert about the things that may appear to be the least likely to tempt you. Beware of thinking that the areas of your life where you have experienced victory in the past are now the least likely to cause you to stumble and fall.”

Previously, I have gone dry for a maximum of one month and an extra month may not seem much, but to me it seems like a gigantic leap forward.

Here's the link to that unpleasant little incident that happened to me two months ago (time sure flies fast):

During these two months, I tried to analyze and dissect, what exactly draws me to drink alcohol (mostly wine, but sometimes hard liquor too). And I think I found an answer: it is this sudden feel of euphoria -  for an hour, two hours, maybe even three or four, I feel elated, energetic, ready to take on the world. Neither coffee, nor tea give me this kind of rush and energy spike. I also forget about all the problems of the world in these uncertain times or at least feel more optimistic about them. It seems like a good way to rest, to ""unwind"". And yet, I do realize that it's all an illusion. That energy will dissipate replaced with headaches and feelings of vomit. Not exactly a good trade-off for a momentary bliss (if you can even call it that).

The problem is that  I am already going back to eyeing the wine bottles in stores or in my cabinet. I still have enough common sense and self-control not to buy them or grab them, but the urge is becoming more and more irresistible. I am sure I am not the only one. Going dry for a week, several weeks or even couple of months is doable, maybe not even hard for some, but for a year? Or couple of years? Or even decades and till the end of the life?! I am having doubts about it as I am sure many are. The antidote I found, for the time being, is the mantra: ""TODAY I will not drink"".

I feel like I was constantly up and down with my emotions before (more down really) and now that I have been sober I feel stable. I feel like taking care of myself again. I have found that exercise eating healthy is crucial for my regulating my mood now that I'm not waiting around for wine o'clock! Which when I think about it now when I would drink I would only be happy for about 20-30 minutes, and then I would feel down and blah. I guess it just wasn't even fun anymore. 

I am hoping to get my husband on board soon but he doesn't seem that interested in not drinking. I keep telling him how much better you feel after about 10 days and he doesn't seem to want to try that long. It is difficult to be around him sometimes now. I am not tempted to drink at all (which is great) but I find being around him when he's buzzed just annoying. He's fun and nice it just bothers me now for some reason. I hope I can get over that but for now I just try to not pay attention to it. 

I can't wait to see how I feel after 2 months. Time does seem to go by slower now that I am sober. I am keeping busy getting to know myself again.

Rock Bottom is as unique as a fingerprint to each of us. How many times have you visited the bottom of your life? What do your rocks feel like? Are they round, smooth, randomly strewn about in a manner that makes it impossible to settle into true comfort, yet still manageable? Maybe they're sharp, jagged, piercing your body with pain with every move you make? Is life so heavy on your soul that you feel buried under all of those rocks? Are your feet anchored to the ground, no way up? Are you standing on a bunch of slippery pebbles, surrounded by boulders, with sharp slabs protruding from every direction you turn? Is it a cold, barren cement box that has nothing to offer but an echo? Could it be a mound of sand under your bum and legs while you reach in only to find everything slipping through your fingers, uncontrollably? 

Whatever your rock bottom looks like, do you have a troll down there with you, encouraging you to stay in the depths with him? I do. He is mean, persuasive, persistent, and ugly to his core.

I've been dealing with drinking too much for a while now, not sure exactly how long.  Nothing dangerous, but enough to affect my relationships and my health.  I've been looking for a solution for a while but the traditional programs did not appeal to me.  While researching I found this sub and it has been an inspiration.

I found ""This Naked Mind"" recommended on some threads and read it in a few days, it was fantastic and exactly what I needed.  

As a result of everything, I'm on day one and feeling pretty good about it.  Still not feeling great physically, but it's not too bad and it will pass.  The hardest part is the anxiety.  I already deal with some trauma-related anxiety from work (I'm a Paramedic and Firefighter) and this does not help.  But again, it will pass.

I'm not talking to a lot of people about it because talk is cheap, action is where it's at.  I still wanted to tell someone and put it out into the universe.

I remember one week in, feeling vaguely hopeful but not very optimistic. Now it's almost a month, and I'm happy to say I've marked every day the past week as ""easy"" in the I Am Sober app.

It took about two weeks to admit to my SO that I was quitting, and he has been generally supportive (other than a few drunken episodes and him not respecting my covid safety boundaries). But I am feeling so much more proud, confident and secure in myself and I think he is noticing that and his attitude towards me is changing. (I never realized how meek and uncommunicative I must have been before). I'm more productive and less stressed at work.

In the past month I've lost 10 lbs, especially around my middle. I attribute this to fewer calories overall from not drinking, but also to making better decisions about food and exercise, now that I have motivation and discipline back. I'm training for a 10K, doing spin classes twice a week and am back to a daily yoga routine. A mysterious back pain that had been developing over the past year is gone. I'm so fucking hydrated, every single day.

My innards don't feel enflamed, bloated and sore anymore. My stomach does not feel sick and acidic. My joints and muscles recover more quickly from intense workouts. I'm sleeping 8-9 hours a night. My skin is not puffy and red and my eyes are clear and white. How did I ever live like that!

I've picked up some old hobbies I had abandoned (embroidery, painting, photography) and have started some new ones (digital art and graphic design). I'm thinking about taking voice lessons! I can't play any instruments but I've got a decent signing voice that could be trained...for fun, not anything professional.

The cravings were (and are) hard and the FOMO is real, especially coming up on summer, but I'm feeling pretty strong right now. I still retain a wariness about the ""one drink might be okay"" sneaky sneaky addict brain and whenever I have that thought, I take a few moments to examine it a little deeper. The internal argument against drinking is getting stronger, but I recognize that it will always be there in some degree.

Anyway, just some positive things I've enjoyed about sobriety in the past four weeks. Thank you SD community for your support and feedback - I couldn't have done this without you!

**TLDR** \- How do you deal with (half conscious\\unconscious) urges that come later in your sober journey? Not the initial struggles of first couple of months, but those that come 200 days, 300 days, two years later? Do you have any mental approaches to this? Any tricks that help you get your mind off those thoughts? Are there any books that maybe focus on helping stay on the path of sobriety? (As opposed to something like This Naked Mind that mostly focuses on how to start the journey, and how to fight off initial urges). 

\---

I've mostly been a lurker here, but I did make some posts during some of the most important moments of my sobriety journey: the fall, first achievements, and two slips. TLDR I've been sober for almost 230 days, then slipped, and after another 25-ish days I slipped again.

So after these two fails I want to ask about some advice, some of your experience on how you deal with urges, not those initial ones, but those that come later down the sober journey. For example This Naked Mind clearly mostly focuses on early stages of sobriety, and while it's still relevant to read it after some time passed, I clearly see that like half of what's written in that book does not apply to me anymore. Things like ""making a choice to live without alcohol"" things like ""its hard to leave alcohol in the past as it's been a big part of your life"", etc. I've already decided, I've already felt how great it is to live without it, I like my life without alcohol and I don't want to drink. 

I did not even have any really strong urges after first month or two, most of those 230 of my sober days, and most days after my first slip I did not really get those. Maybe that's what left me unprepared, as I was not ready to fight them off when they suddenly rushed on me so unexpectedly.

Now that I’m on day two I’ve had plenty of time to deconstruct the past week and how I got to this point. Some key takeaways:

Relapse doesn’t come out of nowhere, in hindsight I should’ve seen this coming from a mile off. It seems the main driver for me is reverting to an alcoholic way of thinking that I’m not good enough and alcohol will make that feeling go away, basically trying to distract myself from fear of things outside of my control. Two important factors that led to this relapse were a job review and convincing myself I would not succeed despite all the evidence to the contrary, and going on my first date in a year. Drinking did not help either of these in the least. The job review went well only because of the last three months of sobriety where I was crushing it. Monday and Tuesday were a bit of a mess but I got a pass. The date went better than it should have but definitely not my best performance and now I’m stuck with anxiety about having to tell this person that I shouldn’t have been drinking in the first place.

After watching my partner have a glass of wine on pasta nights and not joining in a couple times this week, I decided to drink. One issue with me (which is why I'm interested in becoming completely sober) is that when I drink, I have to get a buzz. I don't like the taste of alcohol. I've drunk for the ""fun"" feeling in the moment. Compare that to my partner who has a single glass of red wine or a single beer once or twice a week. 

So I had around 3 drinks. I ordered a sugary dessert, as I tend to overeat when I'm drinking. I barely remember the TV show I watched while drinking. 

I woke up in the middle of the night with a pounding headache and lost a couple hours of sleep trying to fight it off. I woke up this morning dehydrated and not feeling refreshed like I had during my sober week.

I wrote down my feelings after having alcohol in a journal this morning. I also have a list on my phone of benefits of not drinking.

I consider this progress, because drinking last night reminded me of the utterly negative effects of drinking. I reset my day to Day 1 today, but I look forward to going further this time around.

It's not too late to stop drinking. This group is fantastic.,"Hi all, I felt like posting an update so I thought I'd make one. I get too anxious about these things and often decide not to do them but well, here goes! 

I went to the doctor yesterday for a follow up about my labs. She originally ordered them because I had an elevated heart rate without a diagnosis of hypertension. I've always had a high heart rate, although I'm sure drinking hasn't made it any better. I googled all my lab results and was afraid that I'd done some serious damage to my kidneys and liver. Anxious brain immediately jumped to cirrhosis because I'd been drinking so much for such a long period. But all went well and turns out I'm pretty healthy, minus one of my liver enzymes. I did a follow up lab and the liver enzyme is higher even though I didn't drink in the past ten days, but still, I'm sure it'll get better as time goes on. 

I also had a visit with a dietician and she basically said my weight gain could mostly be attributed to the drinking and the psychoactive medication I am on (I have anxiety, ADHD and dysthymia). Overall she said once I stuck to a fairly healthy, balanced diet and exercised often I should lose the weight. Cutting out alcohol alone would've apparently been enough.

If I needed anything to solidify my commitment to not drinking, it was the health scare. Thinking about maybe having a shorter life because of the choices I made in my twenties (I'm 27) was scary. I have no thoughts about turning back. I don't crave alcohol. There's plenty keeping me busy right now (and will be for some time).

In other news I've been exercising every day and power walked 3 miles yesterday. I was so proud of myself. My friends and academic supervisor have been so supportive of the lifestyle change. It's been lovely. My mind is clearer and although it's coming to the end of the semester and I'm stressed as hell, I'm not drowning and I don't feel like going back to alcohol as a crutch.

I was out for a walk, enjoying the Seattle spring and in general just feeling healthier than I have in ages. I can sometimes start thinking I’m cursed health wise - huge family history of cancer and heart disease.

I realized that part of my drinking was actually to drown that out - “as long as I’ve got a drink in my hand, I’ll just limp across the finish line. At least I’ll be buzzing and happy.”

I literally stopped in my tracks as it hit me just how fucked up that attitude is. I have 2 kids, 16 and 14, and I remember having thoughts about missing their weddings some day but ... “oh well, at least their dad wasn’t an asshole to them”. (I have a bad history with my own father. Again... how fucked up is that?

I’ve read a lot of the inspiring stories here that I one day hoped too achieve myself.

So if my story can help even one person take the plunge and finally stand up to themselves and tell themselves no, I’ll be a happy man.

I officially lost my best friend of 9 years. My fiancé. Probably the only person on this planet who actually tried to help me. All because of a stupid liquid.

I’m 25 and have been abusing alcohol for close to a decade now, when I put it like that, I realise just how stupid that really is. I dragged my girl down the deep descent that I used alcohol to try and escape from. I hurt her emotionally more than I ever truly thought I would allow myself to. She finally reached her breaking point and lost all emotions towards me.

If that wasn’t bad enough, I had 2 months of last chances, where we lived separately and I was meant to prove to her I could change. It was rough and I would still find any excuse to drink (just one last time I’d tell myself basically daily) I told myself that if she could run around with other guys why can’t I drink, fuck it right? I pinched a nerve in my back again so what better to do than to spend those days home from work drinking my Litre of whiskey, good idea right? “oops I ran out of grog and it’s still early so I better go get more”. My friend passed away, what better way to pay my respects than to get hammered, right?
Wrong, wish I figured that out sooner tho.

She found out. It wasn’t pretty. I cemented her decision and ruined any chance of her feelings returning towards me.

I hate myself. I hate alcohol.

Day 1 just ended. Depressed and upset all I wanted to do was crack a bottle. But I finally chose no, I will no longer lose any more of my life to that stupid liquid. I’ve lost enough. 
It’s gunna be a long journey. Wish me luck

I’ll be 2 months drink free on saturday! This is the longest I’ve gone without a drink in years. During 2020 my mental health really declined and i was binge drinking alone and blacking out every night. I feel great and surprisingly haven’t really had any cravings or been tempted, even when my new neighbors gave me a bottle of wine, I just saved it and gave it to my Dad.

In about a month I’m officiating my friends wedding. It’s almost a relief i’m drink free now because I could see myself gettin drunk and doing a bad job and telling myself drinking would calm my nerves. 

When I quit drinking I didn’t plan on it being forever, and thought that maybe some time in the distant future a glass of wine with dinner would be ok, or on very special occasions. 

This seems like a special occasion, and I can refuse drinks pretty easily saying I need to focus on officiating, but if I’m involved in a toast I’d like to participate but I don’t want to deal with guilt afterwards. I really don’t think it would cause me to go back to old habits because i’ve dealt with some really stressful stuff these past two months and haven’t turned to alcohol to cope so o think my willpower is strong enough. 

I guess i’m just looking for any advice on what to do,

I always said to myself ""never again"", but after a few months, ""never"" felt so oppressive. It made me feel deprived. It made me envious of people who were able to have one or two drinks. That deprived feeling would always result in a relapse.

I have only shifted my thinking slightly, but it has made all the difference. I no longer say to myself ""never again"". I say ""I could have a drink right now, but I don't want to."" It's a choice. Saying it out loud helps me to really understand that if I have a drink, I will be going against what I actually want. As a bit of a control freak, being compelled to do something I don't want to is just not acceptable. I guess the sheer ""stubbornness"" of my personality won't allow me to. It has actually helped me to reframe how I see my so-called flaws. I was emotionally abused in my childhood. I was told I was bad, lazy, manipulative, disrespectful and stupid. A lot of it was projection by a mentally ill parental figure. I never took the abuse lying down, and was told that I was ""stubborn"" for resisting it. I now see myself as ""determined"" rather than ""stubborn"". I resisted the abuse because I was *determined* to maintain my self esteem and self respect. Even at a young age, I knew that those awful things were not a reflection of me, but of my abusers. Still, it has had lasting impact on how I see myself. I am now trying to do the loving, gentle parenting I needed.

I used to think of it as ""I can't drink because I'm an idiot who can't control themselves like other people, so now I have to be punished.""  I have reframed that thinking to ""I am determined not to drink because *that is what I want.""* Period. Full stop.  It isn't because I'm bad, stupid or weak. I deserve to be healthy and clearheaded. I want to be present for all the big moments. No more half-forgotten milestones.

I finally am fully vaccinated so I took a day and went out shopping. I did all the things that for the last year have fallen into the category of being pretty safe masked but far enough from necessary that for me it seemed silly to take the risk, albeit how very minimal it would be. But now that I’m vaccinated, that has tipped the risk equation scale in favor of going and doing those things. Anyways, I stopped by a clothing store which I used to frequent pre-COVID and as I was walking in I realized that I also used to make a habit of going to the giant liquor store that was next door post-shopping trip. So I went into the clothing store and browsed (I didn’t find anything I liked) and then headed over to the liquor store. I knew I wasn’t going to get beer, wine or hard alcohol - I wanted to check out one specific section: their non-alcoholic beer. 
So I go in and have to be directed by a staff member to their non-alcoholic beer, and it’s great. I’ve mostly been drinking NA beer from Athletic Brewing, and this place carried so many more brands. Ones that I had never seen before! I’ve tasted my way through some pretty nasty ones in the past 12 months, so I looked up online some ratings and left the store with a 6-pack of non-alcoholic beer from a brand I had never tried! 
I know this situation isn’t an everyone situation, and that many would be best to stay out of the store completely.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I hope everyone was able to add something to their self-soothing toolkit yesterday. I am putting some of it into practice this morning as I dreamt I was wandering in the city at night and agreed when a stranger asked if I wanted to 'party'. 

In the dream I woke up dishevelled and hideously hungover in a strange place. Drinking dreams are scary! 

This raises a good point as I know exactly where the dream came from. Over the past few days I have binge-watched a TV show with lots of alcohol use/misuse, unwise sexual activity and upsetting themes.

There were a couple of points where my gut suggested that maybe this wasn't the best bedtime viewing or that I should space it out with something more light hearted, but I ignored it as I was impatient to know what happened next.

Our gut is a very wise friend, sometimes gently suggesting something isn't a good idea and sometimes screaming at us. When I was drinking I could almost block out the feeling and ignore its many attempts to keep me safe. Now I'm sober, it's not as easy to ignore. 

Sometimes the fear of missing out makes us take unnecessary risks. But our gut is a good indicator of which sobriety challenges we are ready to face. After much deliberation, I recently declined a hen party as I knew in my gut it was not the right place for me and my sobriety to be.

The hangover on Monday sucked but what has struck me the most is the lasting effects on my mood, appetite, and sleep. These three aspects of my life had really come together nicely during sobriety and they’ve been thrown way out of whack after two nights of drinking.

So, maybe you’ve firmly learned the “moderation will never be my middle name” lesson and you can play it forward, accurately considering risks associated with a night of drinking and can visualize the hangover. These are great. Please also consider the possibility of “I am way more emotionally raw this week” or “I’m exhausted, why can’t I sleep?” and “I hardly ate all day, what’s up with me right now?”

Hello,

I've struggled with alcoholism for almost a decade now, but at times it spiraled out of control. Last fall, I got drunk with a couple buddies and left to go out to the bus stop. I ended up going in the wrong direction and passing out in the middle of the street. Luckily, someone noticed and called an ambulance. I sobered up in the hospital and my mom picked me up a few hours later. I promised her that I would be more responsible with my drinking. Well, that didn't last long...

I set rules for myself, like only drinking on the weekends, and never getting too drunk to walk home. I guess that wasn't enough, because a couple months later, I went to my usual bar and asked the bartender if they would cut me off after 2 beers. They did, but I figured I could handle a few more and that I was being responsible, so I ended up going to another bar and drinking until they cut me off (after an additional 6 beers and a few shots).

They asked me if I was walking home, and I said ""yes"" but I actually went to the next closest bar and had more beer. I was halfway through beer #3 and shot #4 when the bartender came up to me and said, ""hey, are you \[my name\]? The bar down the block just called and said that you are extremely intoxicated and that you really shouldn't be drinking any more.""

I pounded down the rest of the beer and decided to go home at that point. Due to the pandemic, there were no Uber/Lyft rideshare drivers on the road, so I decided to make the 1-mile walk home. I ended up tripping over something like a tree root and scraped my knee up pretty badly, but I got back up and kept walking. I guess someone saw me stumbling around, because a police officer pulled up and offered me a ride home. I told him I was okay, but at that point, his offer turned into more of a demand, so I rode home with him. I was so grateful that I didn't end up spending the night in the drunk tank...

That should've been my wake-up call, but it wasn't... I kept drinking every weekend whenever I had the opportunity to do so, and it quickly turned into drinking every day again.

Fast-forward to last Sunday. I woke up really hung over after hanging out with a friend, drinking a shitload of vodka and beer. I went to go pour myself my morning coffee, but my hands started shaking so badly that I spilled half the coffee pot all over the floor.

I was shocked. I really thought that the shakes only happened to older people, or that they wouldn't happen to me because it's not like I was drinking a gallon a day or anything like that...

I got the mess cleaned up and tried to pour my coffee again, but I was shaking so much that I scalded my hand with the hot-ass coffee and ended up dropping the cup directly onto my foot. Another mess to clean up.

I don't know exactly how it happened, but in that moment my mind started re-playing all of the shitty experiences that I had as a result of drinking, and I just thought, ""Fuck this, I'm done drinking.""

I'm coming up on 100 hours sober now, and so far it has been kinda tough. Writing has always been a useful coping mechanism for me, so I decided to sit down and write this post to distract myself until the bars close.

After a rough year of captivity during a pandemic, healing from heartbreak, grieving the loss of the person I thought I used to be, by getting sober (nearly 4 months now) I have decided to take a vacation, and I'm planning to remain sober throughout it. But sober travel is difficult to fathom for me, as holidays have always revolved around drinking, alcohol was my comfort in an unfamiliar place, and when traveling alone I used alcohol to placate my loneliness or as liquid courage to get over my social anxiety and talk to strangers. 

But this trip, I want to be fully sober so I can prove to myself that I don't need to poison myself with alcohol to enjoy life. I will be off the grid for a portion of it so I will not have the relief of hiding under blankets watching Netflix all night while I'm away, instead I need to face uncomfortable feelings if/when they arise, traveling can cause a lot of anxiety for me, and alcohol was always my way to cope when I was out of my comfort zone. 

I worry about lonely evenings, I worry about cravings (and my deceptive mind saying ""you're on vacation, you deserve it""). I worry about being surrounded by drinkers, I worry about being offered a drink and not having the strength to turn it down. 

Being sober, it really feels like I'm learning to do everything again for the first time. So my first ever sober trip has me a little anxious but the challenge also excites me. 

If you have any tips for a solo sober traveler, please share your wisdom with me, I need the reassurance that I don't need alcohol to have fun, or enjoy my life.

Thank you ❤️

Not a daily thing whatsoever, but every weekend I’ve just been getting hammered with friends. Some weekends I’ll get so drunk I’ll black out and some weekends I’ll just get super drunk and bob in and out of blackouts. Either way, I wake up the next day with god awful anxiety. Like can’t leave the house anxiety because the sky is falling anxiety. 

This last year I’ve been trying to be better. Going a week or two without drinking completely and what not. Which is doable, but so boring. I wish I could just drink in moderation. But it’s like I can’t stop until I blackout. 

I don’t feel like I have to have alcohol. I’m not sitting here craving alcohol or anything. But it’s just been used as a social crutch for so long. Like something to do with all my friends. I want to phase it out completely because I’m tired of dealing with the embarrassment/anxiety of what I did whilst blackout, but it just seems so damn boring not being able to do anything.

The weeks that I take off alcohol, everything seems less fun and so boring. Sure they’re more productive and you don’t feel like shit ever, but just so quiet and uneventful. And then I have all my buddies inviting me to go do fun stuff and go out and everybody is having a great time. I get real bad FOMO.

Because all of my friends are essentially bonded by alcohol. Which sounds terrible, I know. But i would still rather not be alone.

Maybe this can be a positive reminder about what's at stake for anyone on here who has kids. Idk.

I quit drinking just over 500 days ago. We all know what it's like. It was awful. One of the few things that felt positive about finally hitting rock bottom and taking that decision was the fact that I now had something to bond over with my dad who's been struggling with alcoholism for about 15 years.

He hit the bottle hard during my childhood, and although he never became physical, it was incredibly frustrating and confusing to see him just shut down. He lost his job, mom left, my brother moved to the other side of the world, none of his friends had the energy to keep caring, and in the end there was just us two.

There was nobody left to take care of the house, so everything just sort of fell apart. Whenever a lightbulb went out, nobody would change it. There were unopened letters (with bills in them) everywhere. The lawn started growing over. That sort of stuff.

I can't recall any happy memories at all with him from my high-school years. Just memories of him falling down the stairs in the middle of the night, falling off of his bicycle, constantly hurting his head really badly. I figured that if I move out, he's going to die. He went as far as to threaten to commit suicide, which he still denies (doesn't remember and refuses to acknowledge) until this very day.

Fast forward to now. I'm almost 30 and I have kids of my own. As I said: about 500 days ago I came to the conclusion that I had to stop drinking, realising that I was on the same path as dad.

The book 'This Naked Life' really helped me not only understand the damage caused by alcohol, but actually made we *want* to stop at an unconscious level. That was huge for me. My dad has had his fair share of relapses over the years and I thought that maybe this could help him too. I gave it to him christmas of 2019. He hasn't mentioned it once. When I asked him about it, he just said 'I've read it.'

The other day, I asked him over the phone if he had been drinking today. He replied with his standard 'No'. No further explanation. Nothing. I kept pressing him on it and eventually got upset. Something felt off.

'If you haven't been drinking, why don't you at least acknowledge my concern for you? Can't you understand what's happening inside me when I STILL have to worry about you? I become a child again, and just outside the door, my actual children want to spend time with me.' It's f\*\*\*\*\* up.

After about two hours of back and forth, he finally admitted that he actually had been drinking that day — rendering the previous two hours completely pointless. Back to square one.

**Here's my point:** my dad was my hero. I looked up to him and he was 100% worth looking up to. He was the best. Reliable, handsome, always kind, generous, giving, always putting the need of others before his own. Now (maybe as a result of multiple head injuries and years of alcohol abuse), he's slow, talks about himself and doesn't even respond to half of the things I'm telling him. I believe that my dad is still in there somewhere, but I've done what I can. I've literally payed for him to get therapy, counseling, taken him to the hospital on many, many occasions... Everything. In almost every case, he's refused to acknowledge the fact that there's a problem.

The takeaway for me, from all of this, is that I will never ever decline my children from having intimate discussions with me about my state of well-being, whatever it may concern. I will never shut them out.

I will make sure that I can be there for them, reliable and honest. It was never my dads intention to lose my trust or to fall this far. He obviously wanted his grandkids to be able to come over to him, and it must be his worst nightmare that they've never been over even once. 

But it did happen to him. And when I realised it was happening to me, I made the decision to step off fast. 

Alcohol doesn't make exceptions. Give enough of yourself over and it'll find a way to take all of you.

Sorry once again for the long post. If anybody read through all of this: thank you. Stay honest and happy.",257,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5995376}"

I had three alcohol free days last week (two in a row!) which is a feat for me lately. The boozing days were pretty intense but sober days are sober days. I’m already down on myself for drinking this week just because I drank last night. It’s only Wednesday though! And I was sober Monday. 

It’s all daunting though. I bought all this healthy food and spent a bunch on groceries so I’d eat healthier. I just get home and get lost. I literally don’t know what to do with myself. The loneliness kicks in. The boredom. The paralysis of not knowing what to do or how to expend the anxious energy. I’m working more as summer approaches which has its pros and cons. I’m more stressed and work is more demanding. Should mean I’m more tired and ready to rest at the end of the day. 

But know what helps me “de stress” booze brain says, alcohol! I’m just adding shit to my life. I’m just constantly exhausted. As things ramp up I need to be taking better care of myself. I know this intellectually but my actions and emotions are headed in another direction. I have little to no resilience. I get overfaced and anxious way too fast recently. My body and mind are on a thin line between functioning and just not. 

Alcohol has to go. I say this every time. It’s a gorgeous day and I stayed in bed until 2p. Summer is upon us again and I basically wasted the last one, being wasted. Somedays it seems so futile.

Great news. I have finished my Detox and Residential Program! I posted a little over 3 weeks ago about entering the program after a long binge.. 2 years straight. As of today, I am 21 days sober. My mind is so clear, my liver and kidneys are back to normal, and I have a new hope, outlook on life.

I’m heading home for 5 days and then starting an IOP Program as soon as I get back. Trying to keep the time in between treatments as short as possible.

I appreciate your advice and support. I can’t wait to continue my sober lifestyle, and see what this other side has for me. I know it’s not all glitter and rainbows, but I’m riding this high forever.

Much Love.

Here are some statistics from that month.,"It has officially been 1 month since I had my last drink! It feels like quite a milestone for me so I want to share some statistics about the last month.

In the past **31** Days:

- I have had **0** drinks. This is **155** drinks less than I was averaging in previous months.

- I have had **0** cigarettes. This is **256** less cigarettes than I was averaging in previous months. I could never have stopped smoking without stopping drinking.

- I have lost **12** pounds, meaning I am **18** pounds away from my goal weight. 

- I have saved **$681** that would normally have been spent on alcohol and cigarettes.

- I have got into the habit of eating out **2** times per week instead of the approximately **8** meals that I was eating out before. This is money that I did not count in savings aspect of the 

- I have got into **0** fights with my partner during this month. This isn't to say that we have got along perfectly 100% of the time but none of our disagreements have escalated into something major.

- I have had **0** hangovers. I used to have hangovers **3** or **4** times a week. 

This isn't to say the last month has been easy. My sleep patterns are still out of whack, I sometimes get really critical of myself because I think of the time that I have lost to alcohol, and despite not getting into fights with my partner there has been difficulty for me being around him sometimes because he still drinks a few glasses of wine on a daily basis. 

There have also been other difficulties over the last month unrelated to drinking - I am in the middle of the long process of trying to help my parents come to terms with the need to get vaccinated from Covid, I was laid off from my job because of Covid AGAIN, and I have had to deal with the fact that my feet are not in the best condition and need some medical attention.

But honestly, the rewards have SO been worth the hardship. I feel like I can face my problems head on instead of drinking to ignore them. And I finally feel like I have positive momentum again in my life - I am learning to cook, and I'm taking a course on Python programming while I'm laid off so that I can hopefully transition careers in the near future.

I hope that this post doesn't come off as gloating in any way. I feel the need to celebrate because a month is a big deal for me. It's not the first time that I've gone a month without drinking... I've tried to quit before and made it longer than a month, but I was always feeling discouraged by this point and right now I feel so invigorated because I'm approaching the decision differently and filling the hole that alcohol left for me.

Anyways, I hope everyone is having a fantastic Wednesday and IWNDWYT!",33,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48912466}"

some ""positive"" thoughts i guess: i moderated, drank 6 beers slowly over 5 hours. took my time to really feel the alcohol and kept hydrated throughout. no drunk texts, no drunk posts, no searching for drugs, no high emotions besides laughing at videos with my bf. slept by 11pm, only woke up once feeling dehydrated. woke up the next day, made brunch, did laundry, walked 4 miles. 

so yeah, i did the whole moderation thing. was it fun? sure, i guess. that's how people should be drinking and it can be fun. but also i was thinking to myself i could have had just as much fun while sober? it felt completely unnecessary, especially because it wasnt a special occasion or anything. and while i got things done the next day, i still felt tired and not 100% and i did not like that feeling. id rather be regular adult sober tired than ""i had some drinks last night"" tired. there is a big difference in my opinion. 

don't worry, i am not kidding myself into believing i can moderate. i got lucky, once again. i remember the guilt and shame of the other times i binged and couldn't handle myself. 

my goal is still to cut alcohol out if my life completely and eventually and i do believe ""rewiring"" my brain to believing alcohol really isnt great or fun IS working. its a slow process but i do think i am making progress. i just have to remain vigilant!

These past few weeks have been tougher for some reason (boredom?, nicer weather?), but I find non-alcoholic beer to be a life saver. I also find that fast forwarding your night, in your brain, helps.

So when I go to bed at night, and did not drink, I am grateful for the clear head, a full memory of the night and looking forward to the good night’s sleep (that has been the biggest gain for me).

I quit drinking because I didn’t like where I was heading (depression, negativity, low self-esteem, weight gain etc). Once I had the right motivation, stopping was easy, staying stopped can be a challenge, you have to remember why you quit in the first place.

I used to drink a bit in college, but that was weekends only and it stopped after I became an adult and was married.  Occasional drinks with dinner was my thing.  Very rarely I would have a crazy night with friends but I always hated waking up the next morning so I stopped.

About 7 years ago I moved to a different place - a very small town with literally nothing going on, but my family was close by.  I fell in with a group of good guys - but their main source of enjoyment is drinking every day after work.  

I fell into it HARD.  I wanted to go every day and see this crowd. I get text messages every day - ""I would like to invite you for cocktails at 5. ""  I would show up so much of the time.  I don't always get silly drunk but I often drink too much.

This started me drinking at home as well.  Now I get to 3:30 in the afternoon and it's time to start. The first couple relax me.  The following ones get stronger and then I'm drunk.  But I usually start cooking about 6:30 and it tapers off.  Those nights are not so bad.

But Thursdays - that's the big night. Everyone in the club gets together to munch on appetizers, play poker, and the eat a big meal that someone cooks.  EVERY THURSDAY.  These nights used to end up with me going to sleep the moment I got home, waking up about 1:30am to piss, and then alternating between trying to sleep and needing to piss again.  I wake up the next day swearing off alcohol until 3:30pm rolls around. And the drinks seem to help the hangover.

I've tried quitting a few times, but then get lured back into it.  I love those times:  I wake up feeling refreshed and smart.  I can't believe how good it feels to have no hangover at all.

I have one guy I know who avoids it all.  He's friends with everyone I know but does not drink at all.  He had a problem and was able to kick it completely.  I keep imagining me calling him to ask for advice.

I am now 2 days sober. Just got back from the Bahamas where we spent 2 weeks. I drank way more than I usually do. Starting at 11am most days. By the time the last day came my wife, me and baby were walking through customs it took almost two hours to get through the crowded non air conditioned room while we wrangled a baby from stepping out of line. We get to the customs agent and I’m very irritable from the line but really from withdrawal. The agent kept asking me leading questions which was kind of weird but I started to realize he was profiling me. He finally says “look sir... you’re acting suspicious and your hands are shaking. You gotta help me out here.” He asked me a ton of drug related questions until finally letting us pass through. The whole time I just kept thinking how insanely embarrassing it is that I look like I’m tweaking and almost got myself interrogated in a side room not because I did anything illegal but because I’m a closeted alcoholic who can’t bring himself to tell the agent I was in withdrawal in front of my wife.

In August, I realized it was putting my relationship in danger so I stopped drinking for 3 months. 

I felt great. I was exercising, losing weight. I was becoming the person I wanted to be. And it wasn’t that hard after breaking the habit. I couldn’t believe I didn’t miss it too much. Then I started allowing myself to drink in moderation, a drink with friends, a beer during sporting events. 

Since November 2020, I’ve drank every now and then (maybe 1 time per week max and I’ve gone weeks without anything) and never enough to get drunk. I’ve drank to enjoy the taste, not to become intoxicated or run away from myself. 

This week I’ve gotten drunk twice and it’s only Wednesday morning. I am filled with the same regret and feelings of shame that I had before starting this journey in August. 

I think I want to be sober again for awhile, maybe for good. I’m scared of the commitment and I’m scared of letting myself down. I want to tell my boyfriend that I’ve decided to officially stop drinking again but I’m scared I’ll give in and let him down.

That was a Thursday - and by Friday 'he' had convinced me if I was really serious about this - 'he' needed a proper goodbye; closure, if you will. So I gave it to him. Friday I finished my $100 bottle of Angels & Envy (oh, so fitting), Saturday I finished the Corona's in the fridge, and Sunday was our end of season sports banquet. The glasses of wine were pretty small so I doubled up...6? Only 3 in total?...sure Gracie? Oh, and then some grateful parents gifted me a bottle of Russell's Reserve. It was 1pm on a Sunday afternoon - thankfully I knew better to open the bottle under the table and sip it during our program. But man, did I want to.  I convinced my husband to ""keep it going"" so we stopped for a bottle of wine on the way home (4ish in the afternoon) - returned home, had a few glasses of wine and then I JUST HAD to try the bourbon. Passed out at 10pm. 

Monday, March 15th I woke up as usual - sick and tired. 3/15 would be my sober date. No more goodbyes, no more closure. 

This past 30 days have been seemingly easy. I've acknowledged the urges and spoke to them - faced the fear. I've began to fall in love with myself again, although I'm not quite there, I am determined to get there. I have plans. Plans to find out who I am without the alcohol. Those passions that run deep that have never come to fruition because I put 'him' first. Those ideas, those hobbies, those goals - they now come first. 

I come first. 

I have a good marriage - or do I? Sure we get along, we communicate well. We're each others best friends. But where did the passion and intimacy go? (not just sexually) - I chose 'him' over my husband every night - of course things need work. 

My relationship with my son needs work. I put him through the ringer with my legal troubles for his first 10 years of life - and now he's 23 I decide to get sober? Of course he has some issues. Why not then? Why now, Mom? I don't have the answers. All I know is that what's changed from 20 years ago, is me. And I want to be better. 

I'm on a journey. A journey to discover myself again. A journey to be the best possible version of myself for myself and my family. Alcohol did not allow me that. Alcohol robbed me of that. Alcohol convinced me that I wasn't worthy of that. Alcohol convinced me THEY weren't worthy to have the best Mom or Wife. 

AA gets us to admit we're powerless. And while I admit I was and can be powerless to 'his' grips. 30 days ago I took some of that power back. For today, I have the power. Tomorrow, too, if I'm lucky. 

To those new in the journey and those with many more days than I - thank you.

This was when I was a child....not presently. The message stuck and for many years...I did just that. Doctors diagnosed my with fatty liver...not enough to stop drinking and I lied saying I don’t really drink. I’m a very functional alcoholic. Which is super dangerous. The thing is it is catching up with me now. And as a result my work is starting to be affected. I’ve called out twice due to just exhaustion (pandemic relations to alcohol...I’m not sure).

2021-04-14 06:43:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mqny1c/another_slip/,Another slip...,"God dammit, another slip and only about 20-25 days after my previous one. 

So about 25 days ago I wrote about how I slipped after 224 sober days, ordered a bottle of bourbon and night thinking I could just have a title, and that little ended up being over half the bottle, because no - I can't stop once I start drinking, not until I drink the 'usual' amount or until I fall asleep. 

I probably could before, but apparently, if This Naked Mind is right about it, in about two years before I decided to quit I let myself drink my brain into heavy addiction. Addiction that apparently is to stay with me forever now.

So it happened a day before yesterday. Did not write about it yesterday because I was feeling bad, thinking slow and talking about it to my wife. I'm actually grateful that she noticed it, however hard it was to see her disappointment, if she did not notice I feel like I would've continued drinking as this time I did not pour it all out immediately in the morning. I still had alcohol left in the bottle and I remember thinking ""yeah I'll just finish this bottle tonight, there's not much left, and be done with it"". Yeah, fuck no, I would be ordering next bottle soon after taking first sip.

So... I don't think I need encouraging ""2 drinks in 250 days is x% success rate"" words, because they make it seem like it's less of a fuck up that it truly is. This is a huge fuck up and I should not be drinking again. I'm not even sure that ""I'm not quitting drinking forever, but I'm not drinking today"" mentality fits me. I sure as hell have to say No to this shit forever. Struggling with desire to drink one day at a time - maybe. But not the ""not forever just today"". 

What I don't understand, however, and would really like to, is how exactly this happened. How did I manage to go from successful 224 days, where most of the time I did not even think about alcohol, where I would feel kinda disgusted at the thought of it, would feel sorry for everyone who was still drinking, where I saw this poison for what it is - from that to deciding ""hey, yeah, let's drink, why not, great fucking idea"". 

I did resume reading This Naked Mind as I did not actually finish it before. And maybe in the first few paragraphs there was an answer? I've just read about where she talks that Willpower is like a muscle that gets exhausted. Maybe that's what happened. I kept often fighting the urge, maybe not constantly, but regularly, but maybe something else started to require willpower from me and it drained it to a point where I could not resist? I dunno. I'm not sure I like this theory.

&#x200B;

**I wonder if I should go to a psychologist** to maybe help figure out why I allowed myself to slip? I can't say that I live an unhappy life or that there's too much stress. But maybe there is and I just don't realize it. I also think that maybe in the latter days I was getting bored, and that boredom became one of the triggers. For the whole time before that I was trying to keep myself busy, with anything, tons of projects, work and personal, constantly doing something, anything to not feel bored. But maybe all that work had another side to it, eventually exhausting me to the point where I gave in to thoughts about alcohol? Or maybe what I'm saying is stupid. I don't know yet. 

What do you think?

What worries both me and my wife is the fact that it looks like a bad trend. 224 days, 25 days, what's next? 5 days, then every day again?

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

Well, and I'll wrap it up with a recap of how it happened, for posterity.

So I was taking the kid away to spend the day with his grandparents, and for my wife it was a day without the kid, she went to spend some time with her friends. She said she was not going to drink, as she stopped the same time as I did, though she never allowed herself to drink as much as I did and more importantly as often, so it's apparently a bit easier for her.

But my fucked up brain... That's about the time when I realized it started to plot. It started to tell me that hey, no way she's not going to drink there if everyone else will. I can because I did it before and I know I have a problem so I am not much tempted to drink when everyone else is, but she can actually allow herself a drink and not keep drinking, so why should she be as solid about saying no?

Then as time went, at some point I decided to call her, ask when we gotta get back and such. And with the kind of stiffer than usual manner she was speaking I could tell that she probably had a drink. That's when my brain started to plot, to tell me, hell, if she drank you can too. It started to plot the best course for me to drive back home, to pretend that I need to drive my mom back to her home, etc, plotting best course to drive past liquor store. Also remembering that hey, we're getting a big bed and restructuring our schedules and stuff so we can sleep in the same bed (atm we sleep in different room), and once that happens there won't be a possibility for me to drink unnoticed, so hey, there's your last chance! (f you)

When I drove back she admitted that she had a glass of wine with everyone, I don't have reason to believe she had more, but that's not the point. The point is that I could not stop thinking about alcohol from then on. I realized it for what this is and was driving these thoughts away, to the point of shaking my head physically a few times. Like you know, when you catch yourself deep in thoughts about how, where, how much, where to get it, how to hide it, etc and then like ""Stop, what the hell am I thinking about right now?!"". 

I did not drink that day. I was very close, but I did not. About half of the next day went fine too, and then... Then is what I don't understand, because closer to the evening I had decided  that I will drink that night. I even felt kinda bad when saying my wife goodnight that night, knowing that I'm going to drink. Why did I not stop it there and then? There was a moment when I even wanted to ask her to go to bed with me, to tell her I feel like I am about to slip (as I said, atm we sleep in different rooms). But that 'other voice' shushed and I obeyed. I think it 'said' something along the lines of ""what, you tell her you want her to stay close to you because you are fighting off a craving to drink, what are you a moron, it will make you look like a complete addict, you don't want her to think that! Jut have a drink and she wont notice and everything will be fine!"". Yeah sure. I AM an addict, thank you very much. But at the time it convinced me.

And then the usual. Order a bottle (who the fuck came up with this fucked up delivery service that works at night even though it's not strictly legal here...), ""yeah yeah I will only have one, maybe two, that'll prove I can manage and then I can drink again as a moderating person, I mean they seem to manage doing that in Peaky Blinder, they look so cool drinking whiskey and they can just drink the one and go on their way, why can't I. Sure I can"". Yeah. No, that's fucking fiction and they just make it look cool on screen because half the show is an alcohol ad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So... Day 1 again. Here's some green tea to not drinking again. Ever. I'm not saying IWNDWYT, I want to say IWNDWYE for Ever. I don't even have any hard feelings about not ever drinking again now, I don't want to drink. Not like before, when quitting seemed like cutting off a big part of my life, like a loss. It's not now. I know I don't need it. I know that it does not make anything better, it only does everything worse. Whatever I'm doing while drinking - it's worse, not better. I know that a big part of me did not want to drink that day either, and yet somehow I did.

Don't allow that voice to take control. Don't ever think you can 'heal' from it and continue drinking like you did before you drank yourself into addiction. No, it stays with you forever, that 'voice', those neural pathways that were formed, they stay there just waiting for you to tickle them and they all flare up and activate and start their dirty work. And at this moment I'm not even talking about consuming alcohol that flares them up, if you drink it's full on fire hazard. I'm talking about thoughts. Don't allow your thoughts to expand. Do anything you can to stop them. Switch whatever you are doing now, shake it off, take a shower. If you feel like they are still there - admit it to someone you are close with, a spouse or family, ask for help, ask to be with you, to stop you from drinking. Whatever it takes. The urge will pass, in an hour, a day or a few days, but it should pass.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6643759}"

I already saved quite some money from not drinking and bought my ferret a nice cage upgrade wich is going to be delivered this week!!!

I didn't drink.,"Last Wednesday at 4am I wake up to my phone vibrating like crazy and see that my sister is calling. My sister never calls me in the middle of the night/early morning. I immediately knew something was wrong and just thought, ""Which one is it, mom or dad"". 

I answer the phone and she proceeds to tell me that Mom was in the hospital with a bleeding ulcer. The doctor carterized the ulcer and stopped the bleeding, but it started up again and she was throwing up blood. She passed away around 3am at the age of 66.

I was in shock. Mom wasn't the healthiest person and she actually gave up on living several years ago after her then husband died of cancer. I just always thought we'd know when it was time and have a week or so to prepare. 

It's been a hell of a week driving three hours to visit my dad almost every day, helping my sister (who drove 10 hours on Saturday) to clean up our Mom's bedroom, and just trying to keep my head on straight and avoid being flooded with emotions.

I knew that if I drank during this time I'd only be prolonging the inevitable of facing the flood of emotions. I'd be running away and hiding from everything going on. I'd feel like shit physically AND emotionally. I'd be even more exhausted than I already am. I'd be full of regret the next day. But here I am starting day 24. Not a single drop of alcohol for TWENTY THREE DAYS.

I do have regrets such as not calling her recently. Regrets for not visiting as much as I could have. I know I could have visited more often but I was always too hungover or too selfish because I didn't want to miss out on drinking. However, I know Mom knew I loved her and I know she loved me. Something she said to me during our last conversation was, ""You're such a good son and such a good father"". 

If I were still drinking through all of this or I start drinking again like I used to I wouldn't be living up to those words. I will always remember what she said to me and do my best to be who she always thought I was. She never knew I had such horrible struggles with alcohol. 

Now on to day 24 and try my best to be that good son and good father not only for her, but also my wife and son and most importantly for myself. I miss you Mom and I love you very much.",87,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70814264}"
2021-04-14 05:29:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mqn0ab/did_i_experience_withdrawals/,Did I experience withdrawals?,"I've been trying to get sober for the past 3 years and keep failing.

It often plays out like this... I will be sober for a short period of time (anywhere between 3 and 30 days), I will become so obsessed with sober culture and constantly remining myself that being sober is the better option for me whilst eating well and exercising regularly, life will get too much to handle and I will relapse and drink heavily until I can pull myself out of it (this typically goes on for a few weeks to a few months). Once I get to the point where I need to get sober again I will spent 2-3 days drinking light amounts and spend the nights in bed sweating through several pairs of clothes, having almost no sleep and when I do manage to sleep for a couple of hours it always results in nightmares and sleep paralysis. I will also experience slight audio hallucinations and delusions about my environment.

My question is, is that withdrawals? I've never thought I've had withdrawals before but I just came off a 10 day binge drinking session and last night I decided to go cold turkey and had the worst night I've ever had. I wasn't shaking but I was heavily sweating and couldn't get sleep for longer than a couple of hours before waking up soaked. I was constantly mistaking my dreams for reality and vice versa and slipping in and out of sleep whilst also experiencing heavy sleep paralysis and the most vivid and intense nightmares. 

I am now out of that feeling and currently on day 1. I am determined to stop drinking before it kills me. So, any thoughts on what I experienced? I feel fine now other than being pretty tired and physically exhausted and it has just passed the 12 hour mark since I had my last drink.

Im actually on another sobriety forum but its dulled out for me a bit... I think I'm boring them all with my stories. Not sure haha. Anywho...

I had my last drink sometime around March 19 2021 So I have been sober 25 days.

I got a new job in that time span, and have also come to terms with my codependency. I released those I love like a butterfly and at the same time I got my wings too (freedom.)

To not be attached to anyone or anything is oddly freeing. Not to say I dont have friendships and what not. Hopefully what I'm saying makes sense. Anyways, hopefully this community likes to talk like the other one I'm on. 

On the other one I have to be super careful what I talk about because its for addictions of all kinds... but I personally prefer a more personable approach.. not having to be toooo p.c which I'm assuming since this subreddit is for alcoholism.

Anyways, I love to write. And I hope to contribute a lot to this page. The first time I got sober was in 2017 for a year and a half for a DUI probation. I tried again in 2019 but in 2020 I just switched to trying to ""control it"". I had a terrible binge back in March of this year (2021) and I told myself, well I'm turning 32 next month and I'm not missing another opportunity to turn my life around.

It’s become my normal now, my housemate drinks so there’s always alcohol in the house and it doesn’t bother me any more which is tremendous.

One thing I have noticed recently that I’ll need to keep an eye on is the ‘rose-tinted glasses’. I’m in Edinburgh and we’re about to come out of lockdown in the coming months. Thoughts about getting dressed up and having a Negroni on a pretty terrace in town are persuasive, I’ll need to think of an alternative or workaround.

I’d hoped for a health boost and some weight loss but I’ve kinda had the opposite! I’m eating WAY more and had a few health niggles. But if these were among some of the main catalysts for me stopping, they feel less important now.

I’ll likely stop checking the counter now, next stop is 365.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

From yesterday's DCI it looks like a lot of us have trouble opening up and trusting people. But it's great that we can all share here and know there are others who understand.

The first time I saw my counsellor she asked me how I self-soothe. I had to ask her for an example because I didn't understand the concept. This is different to self-care as it's a response to negative situations or feelings, whereas self-care includes all the things we do to look after ourselves in general. 

Alcohol was my way to self-soothe, plus bitching to toxic friends and partners. I had no healthy way of dealing with things by myself.

I think most of us here will have used alcohol that way at one time or another and finding ways to soothe ourselves is part of all of our sober lives. 

I self-soothe by tuning into what I'm really feeling, thinking about what might help and doing trial and error. TV helps, a cup of tea, journalling, a pep talk to myself, a blanket, lighting a candle etc. Sometimes I search for 'videos to make you cry' on YouTube, cry and then cuddle a pillow. That's probably not something I would share with my team at work, like in yesterday's post!  

It used to take an hour or two to calm down when I was really upset but now it's 10 minutes and I'm ready to carry on with my day. That danger window where alcohol might have seemed like a good idea has got so small that I don't even think about it anymore.

I'm 29 years old, and I can pinpoint when in my life my drinking started getting out of hand. In grade 11 my grades, along with my self-esteem, absolutely plummeted. I was partying a lot, blacking out 99.9% of the time and sleeping around. Grade 9 and 10 were so different, I wasn't really drinking all that much. I mean I definitely was drinking, but maybe like once a month at a party with my close friends. It certainly wasn't the level of debauchery that became so common for me, and there really wasn't any sadness or insecurity there. I wasn't drinking to escape anything. Anyways, cue the summer before grade 11, I went to Italy for a month on one of those trips where you get a high school credit. We started drinking every night. And for almost the entire month, I was, as usual, fine. I never drank to blacking out, I always somehow knew when to stop. I wasn't drinking to escape anything, there was no sadness. But it was consistent, and it was every night. At the beginning of the month, it was maybe 2-3 glasses at dinner. Then my best friend and I started sharing a bottle of wine. By the end of the month, we were getting and drinking our own bottles. I also lost my virginity at the end of the month, to a guy who couldn't have cared less about me. Then the trip ended, but 4 of us stayed on to do a weekend in Venice. On our last night, I had my first blackout. It was the kind of aggressive drinking and blackout night that would characterize my final year of highschool and early 20s. I also slept with a guy I totally did not want to sleep with when I was sober. 

For so long, I have been trying to figure out what changed. Was it losing my virginity? Did something bad happen that I don't remember? But what I realized is, the thing that happened, was alcohol itself. Alcohol is a drug, it changes your brain and how you react and respond to things. And I was using this drug for the first time in my life consistently, everyday. It changed my brain, how I saw my self and how I coped with feelings. As the month went on for the first time in my life I started to feel really insecure, and questioned how my body looked compared to other girls. I was losing myself. It's why I lost my virginity to that guy, even though I wasn't ready. It's why I started blackout more and more - because alcohol made me sad, and insecure, and also made me feel good when I drank it. So I started drinking more and more, to feel good, to escape. There wasn't anything that happened - it was alcohol that happened. 

This revelation has been huge for me. I am on a sober journey and slowly starting to get reacquainted with my former happy, curious, bright-eyed self who was so motivated and interested in the world. It's so nice to see her again.",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.57303995}"

Weather has changed it’s sunny out I drive past the local bars everyone is on the patio and having a good time. The drinks look so damn good. 

You don’t see the reality during the sunshine though. You don’t see the guy who goes home and is belligerent with his family and spouts hate at them and god forbid gets violent. You don’t see the woman who is crying trying to keep her family together while her husband pours bourbon down his throat and forgets all his responsibilities to her and the babies. 

You sure as hell don’t see when you wake up in your parents house with no recollection of anything the night before finding out you have lost everything. Waking up so hungover you black out and fall down in front of a store trying to get a red bull and Gatorade because you feel like steamed garbage. 

You don’t see your friends and family turn away from you and doubt every single thing you say. No one believes your quitting. No one thinks you will. You have to start out one hour. One day. One week. One month. Two months. And then they start to believe in you again. 

I might be having a restless night and unable to sleep. However I’m sober. I’m restless for a few reasons. I have a 1030 tee time for 18 holes on the morning. After I’m done golfing my uncle who has been estranged is hanging out with me and my dad and we’re going fishing. I am so excited. All I have to do is make it through the night and tomorrow will be an amazing day. I’m so close to 365 days i can taste it. I try not to look into the future that’s where it starts to get me in trouble. However I will not falter on this goal. I will make it. 

When my one year mark hits I plan on getting my first tattoo. I wear a bracelet that says HOLD FAST it’s gotten me through so far and it’s always there when I need reminding. I’m thinking about getting it as a naval tattoo as a tribute to both of my late grandfathers both who were in the navy one who was not a drinker the other who was an alcoholic and had 17 years sober when he passed. 

It gets easier but it never gets easy. I know I will make it. This isn’t the first time I have had a night like this and it won’t be the last. I will make it I always have. I will keep the promise I made my wife and my children. I won’t let alcohol run my life again. My history is not my destiny I will make this happen.

Never gonna drink in the morning. - did. Even when it wouldn't stay down and I had to redrink it a few times. 

Never gonna drink at work. - did. And would leave to buy more for the rest of my 12hr shift. 

Never spend money on booze when I need other things. - hey who needs to eat or pay rent as long as I have my booze.

I have gotta say man...Naltrexone...I’m not saying it’s for everyone but naltrexone has completely changed my relationship with alcohol. I’m not saying it’s for everyone but I really wonder what my life would be like if I had pushed to get naltrexone earlier. I have taken it and remained completely abstinent from any alcohol whatsoever, I got out of bartending and started a new job in a new industry. I am happier, less anxious and more attentive to the things that make me feel good than I have been in years and years.

This is probably gonna be a long rant, but I'm grateful for anyone who sticks around reading this. I don't really know where else to go. I've been in AA on and off for almost 10 years, but never really managed to stay sober. I'm from the Nordics, so excuse my french. 

I guess I'll actually start at the end. In December I was hospitalized because of pneumonia. I got oxygen, stuff into my vein, penicillin, etc. Got really sick, and had loads of blood-samples. In this process, the doctors found I had ridiculously high liver enzymes (ALAT) in my blood. I had already been taken for a roentgen so they also took me for a sonogram. The doctor told me I had some fat in my liver (not much, he told me), but I HAD to stop drinking. This came as a quite a shock. I'm only in my early 30's and didn't actually realize this could be possible for such a ""young man"". So, as the doctor instructed, I stayed sober and went back for a blood sample a month later. That sample came out good; enzymes back to normal and the rest looking good. Now, my stupid self decided to get a drink afterwards. And since then, I've been pretty much doing benders every week or the other; staying sober for a few days and then hitting the sauce for another week.

Of course these things don't just happen randomly. I've been pretty much drunk for the most part of 3 years. Before that, I was sober for 3 years, after having, I guess, a pretty much typical collage, heavy drinking phase. Or I guess, a bit heavier drinking than that. I've been a heavy drinking since I was 18 years old.

But now, I'm at the point I'm so afraid of my health. I'm constantly pushing my abdomen checking if I have some pain there. Checking my eyes to see if they're turning yellow. Checking my skin. Every itch on my body sends me into panic. I'm so afraid I'm fucking my body up, but still I can't stop. Every morning I wake up, dying of fear, and the only thing that soothes it is booze. When I wake up, I'm so depressed I honestly just want to die.

I have a daughter who's younger than 10. I've had some dramatic experiences losing a parent. But still, I just can't stop. I honestly don't know what to do.

I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2, so they have me on 4 different drugs. At the moment, I don't actually feel anything. Not sad, not happy. Just blah. Or, most of the time; just helpless, afraid, anxious, depressed.

I (38F) have been sober for 25 days, after years of thinking about how I needed to cut down or quit. The first time I remember thinking, ""hmm, I definitely have a drinking problem"" was in 2012, and it's ebbed and flowed over the years, but for the last two years I've gotten especially depressed and really unable to focus or put in my best effort at work. Most recently I've been drinking between 1 and 2 bottles of wine a night. Despite having had lots of negative effects, I really wasn't able to convince myself to quit until the anxiety over potential health consequences got so much worse than any stress I felt like drinking was relieving. I would lie in bed at 3am wondering if I had destroyed my liver, and it just got to be too much worrying and I really couldn't take it anymore.

So far, not drinking has been pretty easy (far easier than making the decision to quit was) and I didn't really have any withdrawal symptoms, but I am stressing about how much returning to the real world post-pandemic will test me. I've been less successful with working up the motivation to do anything else differently--so far I've mostly just been sitting on the couch at night drinking fun and fancy non-alcoholic beverages instead of wine. But I do certainly feel a lot better and I've given myself a pass to just get through the day for at least the first month, and then work on checking out things like SMART Recovery and therapy.

Some you might not believe happened to you. From cruel relatives who brought us up to snarky classmates, brutally strict teachers, difficult neighbors, hateful and demanding bosses, vindictive co-workers, former and current narcissistic partners or spouses; our memories include them. Many times they surface on their own, and other times they pop up in their full combat mode when we think about something we want to accomplish, making us retreat into our paralyzing turmoil we can't shut off until we learn how.

For example, have you found an outfit that made you smile and wanted to buy, but the criticizing voices in your head shamed you into changing your mind? Do your thoughts say things like you're too fat, too stupid, too ugly, and/or people will laugh at you? 

Has that been your experience? Do you have similar experiences? Maybe you came across a job you wanted, only to talk yourself out of it in record time? You'll get fired, you can't do that, you're not smart enough, no one will respect you, love you, hire you, and/or want you?

Did you hear that growing up? I did. My family brainwashed me into believing those horrid words by repeatedly pummeling me with their toxic waste, grinding down my fragile self-esteem so often that I believed them. They taught me well, convincing me I was defective and to cower in shame. 

As a result, I became impaired, not realizing I lacked the healthy foundation based on healthy self-esteem to manage my life successfully. Instead, with painfully low self-esteem, I became a self-destructive promiscuous low-income addict mess going from job to job, struggling to support myself, and drinking and driving. 

Diagnosed with clinical depression in the early 1990s and with complex ptsd in 2017, I can see why my life was the screwed up chaos it was. 

So, for me, living crippled with depression and complex ptsd was like being stranded on the highway median between 4 opposing lanes of highway with busy traffic rocketing by me not being able to escape to either side, to free myself from danger. 

I say was because my life today is calmer, happier, and more productive than it was back then, but my question to you is this: Can you identify with my writing? Part of me hopes you do, but part of me hopes you don't. If you do, then you too have been brainwashed with toxic waste in your life.

Now, this is what I learned that helped me heal: There is a process to work through those memories to get rid of them, to FREE yourself from them! I know it intimately because I have used it for years! 

I began focusing on and blogging about what scared me on October 17, 2012. I embraced this habit and made this habit *my own* and have used it thousands of times. The benefits are rewarding and astonish me daily. I feel more at peace than I ever have; I don't lay awake at night, worrying myself sick like I used to. 

Before, I was trying to decide what to do with problems with my traumatized brain. Most of the time, the results did not work well at all. Getting rid of their spewed poisonous puke makes it so much easier for me to come up with solutions and to map out what I want to do *and* how to get myself there. I am more efficient and practical than I ever thought I could be. And that is because of the hard work I have done and still do today to continue to clear up and rid myself of the emotional wounds that held me back. Don't the words emotional wounds sound better than mental illness? I prefer it.

Ok, to get back on track, if this process is new to you, I urge you to find a professional counselor who can help you through these steps. Remember, your therapy sessions are just that: they are YOUR sessions for you to work through what troubles you. You decide what your topics are and you decide the pace. 

Back to my subject, think of something or someone who upsets you. What do you think it would feel like to face them calmly, thinking on your feet and not being intimidated by them? Even running into them somewhere or talking about that situation and not being upset by it. It not only makes you feel better by keeping your cool, it strengthens you at the same time. And that benefits your self-esteem.

I have experienced that several times. And let me tell you, not having all that torment and crap flying around in my brain is as refreshing as a delightful spring rain. When I think of something I want to do now, my brain is on board with me. I don't have to fight my way through complex ptsd flashbacks or the constant toxic waste spewed by my mother and sisters chanting hateful criticisms in my face for hours. Hearing that all the time creates a lifelong pattern in our brains. 

The reason for that pattern lies in how our brains learn and operate. So, if you grew up surrounded by people who ripped your fragile self-esteem daily, your brain becomes traumatized by the constant attacks. Young brains are still developing and trauma impairs the brain structures, which impairs the development. Amnesia is one result of that. Complex ptsd is another. So is depression, and several more.

Think of soldiers who have seen combat. They have developed brains, yet the trauma of combat impairs their brain function. The changes show up in moodiness, depression, illness, fear and more. They need to see a counselor and also a psychiatrist for medications to help them get better. 

One thing that can benefit us is knowing our brains are ""plastic"" meaning we can change how our thoughts play out.

For example, neuroplasticity can be viewed as a general umbrella term that refers to ***the brain’s ability to modify, change, and adapt both structure and function throughout life and in response to experience.***

How mind-blowingly COOL is that? Yes, I know ""blowingly is not an official word, but please work with me!

Ok, here's the process with some more explaining:

First, I had to admit and accept how deeply that behavior or those words wounded me. My hurt feelings, the pain I felt and drank and drugged to not think about, damaged me. It held me back because the more often I heard those hateful, untrue words, my brain believed them. That is how we learn, right? Doing homework when we were in school, we had to read and reread what we needed to learn to pass our classes. We believe what we tell ourselves and those hateful, untrue words dominate our thinking. 

Now, why would that be? Why doesn't the negative poison settle down and chill out? 

Ahhh! I am glad you asked! It is because that negative, toxic waste does not belong to us. It is not at home inside of us. It has to go. That is why it bothers us so much. It *needs* to go!! It needs to be kicked to the curb so our wounded, hurt feelings can heal, which betters our lives along the way.

So, how can we do this?

How I turned my thoughts around began with blogging about what I gave thanks for daily on February 12, 213. I still give thanks daily, but I stopped blogging about it over a year ago, I think on March 24, 2020. I can't explain why, but then that was what felt like I needed to do. I will start that back up because I love writing about it, plus I think people reading about it on my blog could benefit them. I am all for that because it is important to include it in a successful recovery lifestyle.

When I wrote with details about what I gave thanks for every day, I added positive thoughts to my negative thoughts. That slowly diluted the negative ones. I had to make my way through my negative crippling thoughts to heal my wounded emotions. Over time, I realized this: ***Our negative and distorted emotions fuel our negative and distorted thoughts, so to heal those thoughts, we have to heal what fuels them.***

Another thing I did was I watched movies that made me cry. The reason they made me cry was because something in the movie touched my soul at a deep level. The emotions tied to that pain surfaced. Because they surfaced, I allowed them to wash over me and evaporate in their timing. I did not hurry this process. Some movies I had to stop and cry for a while before I could continue to watch them.

The three movies I watched that stand out the most to me are these: Les Misérables, 12 Years a Slave, and the Salem Witch Trials. And like I said, it took me a solid week to get through each one. Again, I paced myself because I wanted to face those emotions the best I could. To describe to you what that was like for me was this: I felt sad for a few days. I didn't want to hurt anyone, or hunt down my abusers. I stayed home and let my emotions do their thing. Once I got through that portion, I felt happier and wanted to have fun. I took baking back up, which I stopped doing because of my depression.

I stink at pacing myself, but I tried to be careful about not overwhelming myself. I kept going because I needed to and I wanted to.

So this is the formula: facing plus accepting what wounds your emotions equals healing.  

You do this and you will learn a lot about yourself along the way and every day, you'll see tiny improvements that add up. I encourage you to keep notes so one month from now, or 6 months from now or whenever you want to, you can look back and see how far you have come! And that feeling of happy, fulfilling pride will feel better and last you longer than any drug, alcoholic drink, or any self-sedating behavior you did to manage your pain.

In closing another important benefit is as I kept going and keep using this technique, my real self buried under the brainwashed toxic waste I inherited from my hypocritical abusive family, is stronger every day. Back then, I was miserable and worried; today I am confident and doing everything I can to keep myself moving forward. It thrills me to see firsthand for myself the difference that hard work made in my life. 

Now my question to you is this: How can you take what I have written and make it your own, based on who you are? Where can you start, if you are ready to? What would help you the most, if you want to start this healing journey, remembering to pace yourself along the way? 

Remember, the decision is yours to do; when and how you start is your choice. It doesn't mean it is right or wrong; it is simply different to suit your needs. How you suit your needs is your responsibility and privilege to do. Now, you might see significant progress much sooner than I did. Your path will differ from mine, just as who you are will differ from who I am. So, take what I have written and not to pressure you, but, if you can and when you decide you are ready, surpass me!! But, don't compare yourself to me or to anyone. Just try to do better than you did before. Only compare yourself to yourself. That is what matters. And let me know how you do!! ",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86469525}"

- More TIME. Who knew there was so much you could get done in a day?? I even managed to squeeze in a spring clean after a day of work.
- More energy. I was really restless yesterday and went for a run. I achieved my longest run yet — 3.5 miles.

Of course there are real struggles to. I’m bored in the evenings. I don’t know what to do with my hands half the time? Like I’m just so used to bringing a glass up to my lips. Drinking an unhealthy amount of Coke Zero, but also tea and sparkling water. Snacking a lot. Feeling a bit sad that my social life will suffer.

I've started to watch Bojack Horsemen again, and after developing more EQ since last time it hits different. I've identified narcissistic patterns in my family recently, and what happened to me growing up in that. 

When I started drinking more it was when I just graduated college (after 7 years), had a severe issue with my eczema, and  could not find a real job. My stepfather died of cancer, and I quit a church that I had been apart of for years(I almost went out of country to plant a church with them). I think that performance or achieving expectations is so engrained in me that since I didn't achieve \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ time in life I feel like a failure or imposter. And too late in life I've realized how important money really is to establishing yourself, dating, and securing a future. I drink past the point of enjoyment to make those thoughts and feelings go away.

So watching BH now makes me see things in myself that allow me to keep a pack or bottle in my room for 80% of the week. I wonder if that is something that I need to manage and accept, that because I think this way it fuels the need, or if it's playing off the drama of the show to think that my problem is more exciting and deep than it is.

i kept drinking big mixes of drinks and before i knew it i was very very drunk- i didnt realise it at the time because the drinks weren't that high percentage but they were all mixed together  
i went into my roommate's boyfriends room where he was playing with some friends! i was joking around and saying 'oh who are you talking to' and 'let me talk to them!' we were both joking and he let me speak to them but the mic wouldn't work so we were trying to figure it out  
He left momentarily and i joked that i was going to hack his dicord and he said go ahead so i messaged the friend he was talking too saying joking things like haha ive broken the mic, etc  
I soon felt after as if i broke a massive boundary by messaging the friend despite roomates bf saying go ahead

this is where my memory goes, i remember going to message his girlfriend (who is my roommate) as a joke and i started scrolling and saw some messages concerning myself in a negative light, I tried to get off of discord but ended up continually scrolling because i was very confused on how to close discord due to not using it and the bf having double monitors  
I felt very devastated and went to sleep soon after   


In the morning i still felt very devastated, i spoke to a friend about it who advise i spoke to them about it, which i did- i remembered seeing the messages, trying to get off discord and scrolling a lot because of the confusing set up

I dont remember doing this at all but i DID do this, i DID this  
Ive had a pattern of doing awful things when drunk, i slapped a friend as a dare and they cried, ive broken a bowl at a friends house causing their farther to become angry, i went on a friends messages causing them to lose some trust in me

Im so so incredibly ashamed  
I drink because i feel like im not fun enough and out of anxiety, i kept saying id stop but i haven't

I've  been on a self discovery journey pretty much since covid hit and lost my business, friendships and respect of many. All my toils and troubles were a great excuse to drink those emotions under the table...but things never started turning around for me in all truth be told...until I quit. Within a couple weeks I had a couple of really great job offers, one that I accepted and am totally loving, after 9 months of applying for jobs I was more than qualified for with no results. I am meeting real adult people who have more going on and to offer than just an occasional good time. I've been more consistent about working out, making my bed, taking care of my skin...all things that were nonexistent before but establish a sense of pride and feeling of having your shit really together. LOL

So things I've gained - self-respect, healthier mind, body and soul, more money, more engaging relationships and better personal boundaries - and my sense of humor is back full boar....I'm not sure what it is, but when drinking I think my vibration was just so low that I was just dulled emotionally...

Things I've lost - FOMO and some friendships that I chose to stop putting effort into...it seems I had quite a few relationships that were maintained by alcohol... It's disappointing but I'm sure I'm not the only one. And though I try so hard not to judge considering how long it was that I was right there with them...I sometimes can't help it.

I woke up the next day feeling so ashamed and guilty and sad over losing even more friendships due to my drinking.

I live in a really small town and work at a gas station. My ex’s whole family, his friends, the girl he (possibly) cheated with... they all come in to the gas station regularly. 

My anxiety has gotten so bad while I’m at work that I don’t want to go in because I’m a nervous mess the entire time I’m there. I’m constantly watching the cars that pull up, hoping to god that that truck isn’t his dad’s, that one isn’t his brother’s, etc. Because I’m worried about how they will treat me or what they will say to me. Eventually I know I will have to reach out and apologize to every person I wronged... but that’s in the future, when I am stronger and more aligned.

Is this something that will get better? I fully intend on sticking to my sobriety and becoming accountable for my actions, but man, this is rough. I don’t want to lose my job over something like this.

If this isn’t the right forum, I apologize.

I am a spouse to someone who is working on recovery. They are early in their early stages of recovery from drinking. What can I do to help support them and make it easier for them to keep sober? I do currently still drink. Maybe 1-2 nights a week, I’ll have a few beers. I keep no booze, wine or beer in the house. If I buy a 6 pack, and don’t finish it, I dump it and put the empties in the recycling. I do not drink in front of them, I go in the basement and game while they will remain upstairs. I have asked them about this and they say it’s alright. I did offer to not drink at all while home. They have started doing AA at their choice, and also have a very supportive family. 

My main thing is about supporting them so they don’t relapse, it was one factor that was destroying our marriage, and I finally had to draw a line in the sand. Alcohol or our marriage. I plan to start doing AlAnon meetings to get more information, but felt that it’s also good to get perspective from people who are actively trying to quit. 

I do speak to my spouse about what I need to do, but they don’t tell give me a lot of direction, I tend to be the better communicator in the marriage.

It got me thinking about how numb I was when drinking like I was in my dream.


The drinking itself in the dream painted a pretty bad picture. Invited to a party by someone I respect, and blacked out. It was the type of situation where in the morning people ask if I’m alright at first. Then they start to fill gaps in my memory like “your shirt is gone but we dressed you as best we could.” Stuff that lets me know it was one of those nights where I got naked for one reason or another, lost most of my belongings, and made an impression as a maniac on everyone there. 


In that moment I would already be thinking, “no more invites from them, guess I’ll be alone” and I would be plotting on how to get stocked on alcohol by the next time my body was able to drink again. That thought never fully formed, my anxiety would spike before I thought through my fears, being alone and abandoned, and it would drive me to go home, get stoned, lie in bed until the stomach pain passed. Then I would perpetuate the cycle of avoiding thinking about being lonely by thinking about the next drink. Wake up again much better, still sore but good enough to get stoned and go about my day. Have a plan for drinks again the next night. Wake up feeling great. Get stoned, have drinks again, this time a few too many. Wake up hungover, get more stoned and maybe take adderall if it’s a big 
 day. Each day a reaction to the day before.


Today I am grateful for the opportunity to be sober, and to feel. It is a gift to be intentional about my actions. Work stress has me pretty emotionally detached through the week and this dream feels like the pressure valve releasing because it’s my first day off. It is a reminder that I might get some benefits out of journaling in the morning to let off that pressure throughout the week.",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49203065}"

We decided to go to a hotel out of state we've been to before many years ago. Plans fell through so it was a last minute decision, usually I like doing new things in new places but the unintentional comparison has been interesting. 

The last time we were here I remember the entire experience being pretty horrible. Even though the haziness was commonplace and hangovers were just a regular accepted event that I endured, this vacation stood out as being particularly miserable. Evenings were a drunk blurry mix of reminiscing/arguing over bullshit that didn't matter. Every morning was nausea and bile, choking down mamosas trying to imitate vacation fun but really it was a desperate attempt to medicate. Then being hungover and tipsy, forcing motivation to actually go anywhere or do anything. This place is on the coast next to many beaches and a large town with tons of amazing food. Didn't do any of that. At best, we drove by a few, maybe got out for a few pictures to prove we went somewhere and did something. Mostly it was spent either drunk in the room with spotty memories, or sick for hours trying not to vomit, feeling incredibly guilty that I wasn't out enjoying my vacation.

And that was normal for me. The panic attacks were so normal I didnt even remember having them during a luxury massage until I got massaged yesterday and had a flashback. The hell of paying so much money to be confined, naked, and pretending to be relaxed for the sake of the masseuse while soothing music plays but really I'm in a hellscape of my own making is just... Unpleasant. 

This time however, no hangovers or hangxiety. I spend the days enjoying the beaches and looking in tide pools and gathering shells with my dog. I spend the evenings cleaning and going through empty shells (to throw most of them back) while watching shows and relaxing after a long bath. The mornings are coffee without ration. As much coffee or breakfast as I want and none of it dictated by the state of my sour stomach. 

I enjoy the small things. Pure things, like I used to so many many years ago. Saw a garter snake, found a stream that emptied onto the beach. The way the water cut through the sand is very cool and remarkably beautiful. Looking at little fish in the tide pools or finding shells that are still alive and returning them home. Having the balance to navigate the tide pools, or slipping without crushing shame that I'm revealing my dirty drunk secrets. Just opening the shades to let in the sunlight in the morning. It doesn't feel like an attack anymore. Birds chirping aren't mocking me. Children laughing isn't an accusation. The smell of the beach is salt and green not stomach turning nasaeu.

Not too bad I gotta say. I prefer this vacation 1000 times over. The slight sadness I felt over seeing an iconic bottle in a bucket of ice is a negligible price to pay. All I had to do was make my own bucket with selzter. I wouldn't trade these experiences for anything.",45,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.35542735}"

2021-04-09 11:20:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mnji0j/6_years_seemed_like_forever_when_i_first_started/,6 years seemed like forever when I first started.,"When I first started my sober life 6 years ago, it seemed impossible that I would one day be at a point where sobriety was just a part of me, and not something that was a constant struggle.  I would make posts and comments about my experience and people with 500, 1000, or 2000+ day counts would respond with little nuggets of wisdom that I would incorporate into my own journey.  I would marvel and the number of days on their counters and wonder if I could ever get there and also not have it be a struggle any more.  

Now I look back, and it seems like that guy back there drinking two handles of vodka every week was someone else entirely.  If I let myself, I might forget that guy was me.  I might forget how I got to the state I was in with my drinking and how much work it took to get out.  The key for me is to never forget.  If I forget where I was, I almost certainly will end up back there... and I am never going back.  

In celebration of sobriety, allow me to share some of the nuggets of wisdom I have collected over the past 6 years from people wiser than me.  

When it comes to stopping drinking, the key for me is that this is not a passive process. I couldn't just wake up and say ""I don't want to drink today"", I had to say ""I'm not going to drink today, and this is how I'm going to do it...""  And then make my sober plan for the day.  

When I quit drinking, I needed the following:

1. Plans for how I was going to get through each day without drinking.  This has several parts:

   a. Alternatives to time spent drinking alcohol: [Exercise](/r/SDrunners), reading, new hobbies.  

   b. Changing my routines. No more stopping at the store after work.  Instead of cocktails, I had herbal tea before bed. If I'm out of tea, for the love of everything holy, don't use that as an excuse to impulsively go to the store!   

   c.  Avoiding places and people where there is temptation or pressure to drink.  AKA Keeping with [dry people and places.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2szkp8/the_least_popular_advice_dry_people_dry_places/)  This was especially important in the early days, but I still keep it in mind.  For a while this meant staying out of the grocery store.  After that, it meant staying out of the liquor aisle.

   d. What do I do in an emergency situation?  ie, somebody shoves a glass of wine in my hand.  How am I going to react?  [The time to decide is *before* the event happens, not in the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/381vwp/on_the_importance_of_not_making_decisions/)  

2. Support.  There are lots of options for this.  AA, therapy, primary care doctor, family.  I used /r/stopdrinking for most of my support.  There's lots of great information here and great people too.  

3. Mental awareness.  I needed to remember the [state I was in when I quit](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/4e0y7r/one_year_ago_on_a_thursday_i_woke_up_knowing_that/), and why [I can never go back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/17hwpk/for_those_struggling_with_the_label_alcoholic_and/)  I needed to be aware of my thoughts in order to anticipate and deal with my cravings before they became a problem.  

4.  All of these things together weren't enough unless I took [action](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) all day every day to make this succeed.

It's really only this year that I feel like I've finally made progress on becoming a stable person. The first two years had their ups and downs, and last year was so garbage that I had to go on SSRIs for depression and anxiety. Thankfully those helped a lot, and now I feel like I'm finally seeing the benefits of sobriety that other people talk about after their first year. I've finally figured out how to make friends, how to form a relationship, how to take on more responsibility at work. I finally got my license and my first car over the past 5 months. At the age of 29, I almost feel like a little bit of an adult. Half of me feels like I've finally mentally progressed past 21, while the other half of me feels like I'm 60. There's no doubt that the drinking and drugs took a toll on my mental health and cognitive development. 

But it looks like things can get better, eventually. Sobriety just isn't a silver bullet for happiness. Sobriety gives us a stable platform to stand on while we finally fix the shit we've been messing up or avoiding for years.

The new me,"Last weekend I went out to dinner in a real restaurant with friends for the first time in over a year. It was a strange experience. First because of COVID-19 and the simple fact that we were out, eating in a restaurant. Second because it was also my first experience in a restaurant where most folks expected me to drink. I got a number of strange looks when I ordered the diet coke. It was even a little more awkward because out of some cruel fate I was last on the drink request out of like 15 people. It was 3 bottles of wine, a few craft beers, and then me, a diet coke.   


The meal continued and after some time we moved our group (a little smaller) into the bar area to listen to the guitar singer guy that was playing. It was at that point that I started to recognize who was starting to feel the effects of alcohol. A little bit of slurred speaking here or there, maybe a slight stumble when moving into the table after a restroom break. A few awkward gestures towards other groups in the bar that seemed overly loud if not bordering on rude (there was a 75-year-old celebrating their birthday in the same venue). Even the lone guy in our party that decided posting up at the bar was a better idea than joining us at the table probably because he could get his drinks faster that way?  


Probably the weirdest part of the night was two distinct questions that I received separately. Both of them were in the ""are you ok"" variety. The second went into greater detail letting me know that it was all going to be ok and that if I needed to talk they were always there for me. The strange thing is that I was having a good time, interfacing with everyone, smiling, just drinking my diet cokes. None of these folks really even know that I stopped drinking over 2 months ago. Anyway, just thought I would share a somewhat strange experience going out with folks that I used to get hammered with. I love them all and care about each of them.

The league is compromised of a lot of 25-35 somethings with about 20 members. Drinking definitely is part of this league and last season I managed to get through it without a hitch. No one really bothered me. Everything was fine. Anyways, after meeting up for months and months over the course of several seasons. Friend groups have formed.

Anyways, this season I initially decided to leave my title undefended and to focus on growing my business/career(started because of not drinking).

This was a pretty unpopular decision amongst the league as I have made lots of friends in the league and have become reasonable popular. Wednesday night, I decided to swing by and say hello to everyone because I missed them and lo and behold I ended up be convinced to compete in the league again on the condition from myself I wouldn't be able to fully commit like last season.

Everyone was thrilled, the night was a blast. The booze flowed but I didn't drink. I really enjoyed the evening. Towards the end of the night, a bunch of the league members had informed me they were all going out to a country bar by my house the following night and were really hounding me to make an appearance. So I decided to oblige them.

So last night comes around and I show up, I show up towards the beginning of the night. Everyone is as friendly as ever. The drinks are flowing, I'm drinking NA beer and avoiding rounds of shots like they're poison. No one really knew except for my wife and her girlfriend that I wasn't drinking which is kind of funny because I use to drink like a fish at league and no one has seemed to make the connection with me not drinking at league. Fortunately my wife came along with her girlfriend so they got my rounds. Got a little stoned off a friends vape pen which isn't a normal thing for me but I didn't see it as a problem as THC has never been an issue for me.

It's loud as fuck and I'm partially deaf in one ear from prior military service so I can barely hear what anyone is saying. Everyone is beginning to get a little ""un-inhibited"" and starting to get a bit too ""friendly"" with each other including me. Especially with my wife hanging around, definitely unwelcome.  To be honest, as the night progressed I just felt more and more out of place which is weird because I'm a very easy going, gregarious fun guy. I kinda felt like the odd ball out. ***Everyone was talking but I didn't really feel like I was ""connecting""? with anyone..*** The only time I felt alright was when we were all dancing. Eventually it got to be later in the evening, one of the people had some booger sugar which I never thought they were into stuff like that but everyone else kind seemed unfazed by it.   It was late and I decided I had enough, I corralled my wife and her friend (who seemed to be enjoying themselves more than me at this point) and left because I had work this morning to wake up for. Everyone was super friendly when I said goodbye, hugs all around, ""We should do this again soon's exchanged"" and we left. I'd imagine they all stayed out for the rest of the 2 hours the bar was open. Even my wife's and her girlfriends drunken banter on the car ride home was kind of a turn off to me.

I guess where I'm feeling a little fucked up is, my whole life I've been the fun, relatable, easy going gregarious one of the group and last night I felt so out of place in a place that would have normally been my element. The social disconnect that I was experiencing from all these people around me kind of alarmed me while they all seemed so in tune with each other and seemed to think I was so in tune with them while I was having such a hard time relating.

I guess bars aren't my thing anymore and I'm fine with that but I can't shake the feeling of being an outsider. I think in the future I plan on being a bit more elusive when it comes to hanging out side of the league. Honestly, I think if we even at a house it wouldn't have been as bad but the whole loud bar thing where drinking was the main event because I would have actually been able to hear everyone. I just kind of feel strange because everyone on here always says eventually your friend circle may change and maybe this is the start? Maybe the THC made me more hyper conscious of what was going on? I love hanging with everyone during league but it threw me for a ringer last night feeling so out of place and turned off to the whole thing. I have a very good ""mask"" and I played having a good time well, but I would have rather been home.

I am five months sober and things have been great. I've been eating well and exercising. All of a sudden three weeks ago I got this weird pressure in my head. It feels like a tiny balloon the size of a pebble in the front of my brain expanding. There is no pain with it, just a slight pressure like something is pushing to the front, up, and down. Now it feels like there is something heavy sitting in my head and I get randomly dizzy and feel faint. I am also getting minor headaches, which I never really had often (unless hungover).

Has anyone else had weird symptoms like this after being sober several months. My doctor thinks my body is still adjusting after 20 years of heavy drinking, and that weird things can happen.

I am new to Reddit and came across this thread whilst googling self help this morning. I’m not sure why I’m really posting here, but I feel like I have more of a chance of changing my life if I try and get support. Firstly, I am 34, I have a good job, a family and from the outside I have every reason to be happy. I am so deeply miserable, however, and I can only put it down to drinking. I have always had a troubled relationship with alcohol. My mum sadly passed away due to her alcoholism, and several family members are alcoholics. I worry I have inherited their need for alcohol. I do not drink everyday but I always binge at the weekends. Drinking far too much and regretting it every morning, but then repeating the cycle of self hate. Last night I went to a friend’s house for drinks. We had a good time, but I was very drunk and started talking about other men and really oversharing issues within my marriage. I woke up this morning, very hungover, with a pain in my stomach, which I’ve convinced myself is liver related, and a feeling of total sadness and shame. I’ve been crying for hours. My husband and I have had a really good chat today and we are going to try and sort out our issues, but I just absolutely have to stop drinking. The worry of the effect the alcohol is having on me is consuming. I have tried in the past to stop, but I always always go back to it, fearing life is no longer enjoyable without it.

Gonna keep the eff'n short and eff'n sweet as I can

Let me tell you something you may not realize, something that should make the hair on the back of your neck stand up.....you're not driving anymore, when you're in the depths of alcohol/drug addiction - you're not even in shotgun, you're riding bitch in the back seat

Ive never denied my alcoholism, in fact I would argue I'm one of the scariest most highly function addicts you've ever met. I've gotten to where I was/am again drinking 1-1/2 bottles of of that mother eff'n poisonous green labled Jameson every day, thank you Adderall and the coke dealer at the local bar when I finish my Adderall 2 weeks early.

Last week I sacked up, owned up did what I never wanted to do - after my life was spinning out of control, my girl finding tiny coke bags with eff'n skulls and cross bones, cut straws all around the house ( pretty cool for a 37 year old father of three right ) I eff;n owned it I went to Detox, I had enough anyway

14 days I sacrifices, 14 eff'n days without my phone, my job my kids I RISKED everything, I slept through early Detox (once meds were administered) 4 days then spent another 10 eff'n days in residential detox, again I up and left I risked everything I didnt like it BUT by day 9-10 I felt sobriety like a ton of bricks I FELT LIKE I DRINK EVERY DAY TO GET TO, happy healthy, joking smiling, eating living without alcohol, and I felt great.

Now let me tell you, why I feel controlled now, why the hair stands up on the back of my neck know that I;ve been reminded that this 20+ year friend of mine that I prioritize over my own kids, was laughing at me as I actually thought I was going to get rid of him

\- The day of my departure, I had to get medical sign-off - told the doc I've been restless, think its just the anxiety of the 297 missed texts messages, 498 work email and 113 voicemails that I RISKED TO get sober - and he said well actually restlessness insomnia is a leading indicator to relapse, but he signed me off, my BP was 120/80 like WTF?? used to be 167/94 but I felt good

\- I get to the airport , the whole tiMe my subconscious was already planting the seed that morning - theres bars in the airport, you've been locked up man - you deserve one just to relax

\-  JAMESON, you can suck it - I went to a bar, got a burger and and iced tea, winning right ?! the whole time I was white knuckling - the whole time time mr. Jameson was laughing, ""okay just wait""

\- Get on the plane, EFF'n what JAMO - no more alcohol on planes you eff'n soul sucker, suck it ""JAMO says, ok ok we'll see tough guy , remember Ive been the most important friend of your for 20+ years my friend, you aint getting rid of me that easily - why dont you watch this movie called ""Buddy Games"" (which BTW is eff'n hilarious) of a bunch of friends that get together and drink and do dumb shit

\- Here's where there hair stands up, here's how deep addiction here's how smart, seductive and cunning this slimy mother effer is - take a piss, leave the airport - EFF""n A COTTEN you made it guy - get in your truck and go home now ""Mr. Jameson agrees, yea go get your truck guy - remember Ive been  your boss for 20+ years, I've got a surprise for you.....

\-You remember how I made you stop at the liquor store on your way to detox from the horrible damage I've caused to your mind body and soul, well remember how you left it sitting right there - half a bottle waiting for you after you made all those sacrifices. CHECK MATE BITCH - you fought a good fight but I was 20 steps ahead, go ahead drink it you miss me we can try again next time. Remember I've owned you for 20+ years, I introduced to you to Mr. Adderral too

My subconscious addiction, left a life raft knowing I would be weak - why didnt I dump it out, why was he sitting there upright smiling at me

Now I have another bottle hidden in my closet because I cant sleep right?? withinn 48 hours after 14 days - scary shit. Ive been shown just how deep I am in this prison, and the only way to keep going is to fight this pussy aZZ little biatch they call Jamo as hard as I fight as much time as I spend on my addiction I have to spend the same energy and battle on sobriety.

I think AA is important and it helped me quite a bit. My sponsor told me to find someone else because he didn’t think I was working the steps well enough...I haven’t replied back to him. But I feel like if I am not drinking, don’t feel the urge to drink, doing my best to improve the relationships around me, embracing love and health, than I am working the program?

Today is the two year anniversary of what I like to call “the first day of the rest of my life”. That’s the day I woke up in the hospital after my suicide attempt. I’m glad that I got a second chance and I’ve used it to try to be the best version of me that I can be every day. 

I had actually been sober almost a year when I decided to act to end my life. I stopped drinking due to some medical complications and stayed sober because I knew I had a problem. Unfortunately, once the alcohol washed away I was only left with my crippling depression that (unbeknownst to me) was my reason for drinking in the first place. I had years of untreated trauma hanging around in my head waiting for the numbness to wear off. I got sober, but I did not get magically undepressed, hence suicide attempt. 

I’m glad I woke up, I really am. And I did wake up. I’ve been in therapy and on medications and I work every day to be a healthier me. Now I get the chance to make life what I want it to be with no excuses. And I let the petty shit slide. It’s easier to know when something is not worth worrying about. 

I did have a slip up and drank for 10 days in December, but minus those 10 days I’ve been alcohol free since June 24, 2018. I just wanted to taste wine again...10 days later I was done for good. This community really helped me straighten out my priorities again. When the cravings hit, I hit your posts for a dose of inspiration. 

I’ve been experiencing a lot of cravings lately due to holidays and anniversaries. It’s hard, but I believe I am strong. Most anniversary dates are hard for me because I remember dates well and they remind me of people and places long gone, lost to my past drunken self. It’s like the calendar tells me to take stock of all my mistakes, and then I want to punish myself. 

I know now that is not the case and my mindset and how I react to the date is under my control. I can’t help what day it is, but I can use my power of memory for good and try to honor the people and places of days past. All those days made me who I am today and I am closer to who I want to be than I ever have been. 

I want to drink, but instead I decided to post here for the first time. I love to read everyone else’s stories and often find many parts that help and inspire me. I hope that maybe I can do the same for some of you.

I made this account specifically for posting this journey since it’s going to be a personal one. 

I’m on day three. After reading This Naked Mind I feel like my life changed forever. I’m reading Alcohol explained now. 

However, It’s Friday. Usually I would be preparing mentally all day to treat myself tonight after a few days of abstaining. This usually leads to a weekend long bender and then next thing I know I wake up Sunday with my whole paycheck blown, tired, and stressed to get ready for a week at work. 

To remove my focus off this ritual here are some of the positives I’m feeling after 3 days: 

No more joint pain especially in my hands. My joints are not as swollen in my fingers. (I have a connective tissue disease). This is a big one for me and have been on NSAIDS for a while to manage it. 

I’m sleeping so well. 

The birds chirping doesn’t sound like a drill in my head. 

The soreness from the gym isn’t as prominent. I’m more hydrated. 

My stomach is settled and not churning. 

I feel like I smell better. My skin and hair also seem less greasy and gross. 

My sink is empty of dishes and clean. Usually it’s sky high full of dirty dishes by Friday. 

My dog has been walked a mile every day after work - he is getting much more needed attention. 

The negative side is I’m feeling a lot of anxiety right now. Mostly about how my friends will react and how my future will look. But I know that’s because I’m not numbing my pain and anxieties anymore. So I’m turning this negative to a positive and I’ve allocated money I would spend at the bar this weekend and putting it towards going back to therapy.

Honestly there’s been multiple instances of me doing those types of things, and I can’t believe he still puts up with it. We got in a huge argument last night.

In some ways a 300 days post feels like a bit of a cheat, but it was 10th April 2020 that I gave up everything (cigarettes too) and a few months later I had an experimental two beers at a friend's house (instant headache; did nothing for me and had nothing since) so I'm always a bit undecided as to when my day 1 is.(And since I'm doing this, I also didn't drink from January to mid March last year and only hit the wine when the pademic took over and then stopped hitting the wine after a few weeks.  There.)But I noticed that a lot of new posters here are struggling so I thought I'd share what I've figured out. Btw I'm 40 and don't have kids, and drank pretty steadily and heavily from about 21 onwards.

**If you take away 'fun time', then life is all as fun as you want it to be**

This was a big realisation - that alcohol demarcated when 'fun' began, which made me less present in other parts of my life.  I've sent maaany emails to friends at 11am or earlier getting the logistics down for that evening's drinking, and spent the rest of the day marking time until I get to the pub.  Well, now I may as well do my work, right, because it feels good to mark tasks off, and hey, maybe in a break I'll try balancing on one leg for a minute, or balancing a spoon on a bottle, or dancing to a youtube video, because fun is now interwoven and available at any point, because you can't tell me not to be silly just because I don't have a beer in my hand.  Make sense?

**'Being a good drinker' is really not worth your time (or money, or health...)**  
I've been thinking a lot about identiy since I quit, because honestly, being a 'good drunk' (and a roll up smoker) was like, a real point of pride for me.  Looking back on it, I was... embarrassingly proud of it.  I knew how 'pubs worked' (there is a whole set of rules to the British pub system, but it's not a lore to hang a life on, not really) and I 'knew how to hold my drink' (as a woman there's something around drinking as much as your male counterparts but keeping your shit together that can get into your idea of your self worth in a really insidious way) and I had opinions about 'proper beers' blah blah... but you know, who fucking cares, really?  Like, who cares?  And what else are you doing with your time?  The answer for me, was, not much.

**Did anyone else just... sit down for hours around a table when they were boozing?  Like every day?**

  
Moving is good, man.  Your body is waaay happier when it's moving about.  Keep moving.

**Replace your identity.  Once you've done it once, you can do it lots more times, and suddenly life gets open, not closed.**

I'm not the first person nor the last to recommend 'Atomic Habits' by James Clear, but that man talks a lot of sense.  Starting thoughts with ""I'm the type of person who gets up with a clear head"" / ""I'm the type of person who responds quickly at work"" / ""I'm the type of person who takes care of their health"" / ""I'm a runner"" beats the bejesus out of ""I'm lazy / unreliable / 'the hopeless one' / a drinker for life / nearly always hungover"" ... Running in particular has taken me on journeys into how muscles and joints and your feet and hips work and I've seen changes in myself that I'd given up on ever making.  It's really great, you guys, to become someone you trust, to treat yourself well, after so many years of 'fuck its'.  And I know now that when I say ""I'm going to learn the guitar this autumn"", that I will.  Not least because I have the money now.  There are so many ways we can spend our time.  Life is short. Go get it.

**I'm a lot less existential now.**

I used to think I was very thoughtful and was getting at the very marrow of life after three beers.  Nah.  Mainly I was talking shite.  I'm more concise now.  The emotions are still there, the experiences and the hurt and loss that we all have.  I just don't give them centre stage every damn evening.  Again, life's a lot more interesting when you're learning shit and figuring it out by *doing* something.  And amazingly, you may not even need to tell everyone.  You'll just know some more stuff now, and your head will be happier and calmer for it.

I'll leave it there.  As ever, this post was better in my head.  Thank you every soul who lurks, posts, upvotes, cares, tries.  SD is a hell of a community to be part of.  People trying to change their lives is very profound.  God bless and IWNDWYT.

EDIT: Eep!  My post gained airspeed!  Thank you very much, I've had a super afternoon connecting with a forum that has been a really big part of my thinking and attitude, and kind of... creating the inner scaffold needed to do all the remodeling.  I began trying to get back to everyone, but I hope you'll accept a grateful upvote from hereon in.

Just for today, I will not drink with you today!","*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello, my dear SD friends! I hope everyone is having (or is ready to have!) a lovely Thursday. I myself have not accomplished nearly what I should have at work this week, so tomorrow is going to be hectic. But it’ll keep me busy and out of trouble ;)

I want to share a bit with you all about why this week has been hard for me, and why I haven’t been as present and responsive as I really wanted to be. I’m hoping in sharing some of these thoughts I can both help myself process some crap, and with any luck relate to some of you and the same things many of us struggle with. 

My sister came to town for 4 days for Easter (stayed with my parents, who live 20ish miles from me, nbd). For 15ish years my interactions with my sister have been hurtful,  judgmental,  and conflicted, and yet I still love her and long for the closer relationship we used to have. 

There’s a lot to unpack. On her end, I think a lot of resentment and insecurity stem from childhood/high school and her being the younger sister who had to deal with “oh, you’re summer’s sister” and a load of academic expectations stemming from that. This is obviously not my fault, or anything I perpetuated, and it makes me sad that she still feels the need to somehow compensate for that. 

However: her method of compensating is to let me know exactly how much she and her husband make (we’ll ballpark and say $1 million+). I have owned my house for 6+ years, am managing being a single mom, manage a successful business and yet these factors seem to be disregarded. She has visited my house twice, for a total of about 15 minutes. She refuses to tell my nieces (3&5) that I am divorced ... instead if my son is at his dad’s, they are told he is “outside playing with his dad.” She is the only person who has ever judged me hard for my addiction struggles. One comment was “how could you possibly do something so stupid, that’s what 14 year olds who don’t know any better do.” Another was to witness one evening of my drinking 3-4 glasses of wine, immediately arrange a trip to my parents, and confront me with me with my mom (my brother and father refused to participate) about my issues, a 4 page letter of how disappointed and appalled she was by my behavior (do/did I have a drinking problem? Yes. Was it on display that evening? No, other that the fact that I was tipsy. Nothing happened other than I drank a glass or two more of wine than I probably should have, and she didn’t approve.) She staged a full intervention with my mom, including a list of AA meetings and rehab programs. 

Again: not denying I have a problem with alcohol. That’s why I’m here. But both the therapists I’ve seen and talked to about this have said this was a completely over- the-top, crazy reaction basically based on the show “Intervention” LOL

So ... for better or worse, when I know I will be about my sister and family, my entire body tensed, I simply wait to see what I will be judged or snubbed about, and tend to not act like myself because I’m so uncomfortable. 

I realize this is largely about me forgiving myself, and showing myself compassion, and not letting the opinion of someone who shows no empathy or understanding for what I have overcome dictate how I feel. But I’m not sure how to start with that. 

So, my hope is that this is cathartic for many of us. I’m sure there are a lot of difficult and strained family relationships around here. If you’re comfortable sharing, I’d love to hear: 1) how have you dealt with the negative feelings/self-talk/etc and 2) what concrete coping mechanisms do you use when you feel these things building up? And 3) anything else you’d like to share!!!!

Sorry so long, guys, thanks for hanging in there. I love this community and all of you for being here and ALWAYS being so compassionate and supportive. ❤️❤️ Summer

I am only on day 3.  I drank a pint of vodka, or whiskey a day or almost everyday for a year. I probably need to see a doctor but my job only has open enrollment for insurance in November. I am 21F.  Fully functional and no one at least told me if they notice I’m a alcoholic. Not even my BF of 6 years who I live with.   So I’m turning to strangers for acceptance and help. 

I LOVE FOOD.  I was a total foodie.  My alcoholic intake just enhanced it all for me!  I probably gained 30 pounds this past year between liquor and DoorDash.  It got the point I was a secret drinker and would take a shot in restaurant bathroom, or always find an excuse to leave the table. 

Day 1 only ate chicken noodle soup, Day 2  I ate half a bowl of spaghetti, Day 3 only two bites of a Wendy’s burger and I made Dijon chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and roasted broccoli for a family members birthday but I took a bite and it was just like “ meh, nah”.  Every bite made me feel weirder and it’s like I couldn’t stomach it while everyone around me kept eating.  

I feel like food and alcohol were my only joys out of life and i lost both when I only expected to lose my drinks.  I probably need therapy but again can’t afford that until open enrollment for insurance in November. 

It will be nice to loose weight but I want to eat again or at least be able to stomach what I cook. Does anyone know how long will this last?  Or how long did it last for you? My only other symptoms of withdrawal so far are a few muscle spasms( movements idk) and a little chest pain.

My wife allowed me to return home yesterday after not being around since the previous Thursday. Ive been gone longer before but as my kids grew and my recovery, we became very close. This time really affected my children and it was heartbreaking to video call them while I stayed at my parents. Today my 18 month old son and my daughter were playing on the front porch, there's some craft supplies out and various toys. My daughter doesn't know exactly why I wasn't home but that I didn't come home then was staying at my parents. I was inside cleaning the house and she came in and said "" Daddy I made you something."" She handed me a green piece of construction paper with some marker lines on it. She then told me "" It's a map to get back home incase you get lost again."" She then ran back outside and continued to play with her brother. I sat down at the table and I thought to myself how my actions have really affected my family. I told myself I will keep this map as a reminder but I won't need it because I'm never fucking leaving again because of my drinking/drug use. I always say I'd do anything for my family, I would die for them. I can't control the disease of addiction but I can sure as hell manage it and I know how to do that. So I'm going to fucking do it and if I ever feel like I'm of course I'll look at that map and remember what it feels like not just for me but how she felt when she drew it. How my son must have felt, as young as he is, when the dogs were barking and he was yelling daddy because he thought I was home from work and waited at the door but no one came in. How my wife must have felt when I told her I couldn't come home because I was drinking, and I couldn't stop and come home because I had beer left. The feeling she had when she woke Easter morning after the Easter Bunny came for those kids but daddy wasn't there with them to find all the chocolate. I've fucked before and have left my family hanging. This time it hurt more than before, and I'm glad it did. I know relapse is part of recovery. I've filled my relapse meter and I can't have it be a part of my recovery anymore. The feeling of not letting my guard down ever is overwhelming. Today I'm going to stay on top of it. That's the plan for tomorrow as well.",18,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60900515}"

Sure you can ignore for a bit now, it still hurts though sometimes, and your wound is likely to get infected the longer you ignore it, and people can probably smell that dirty rag a mile away. 

Mental health issues can be quite insidious in my experience, I never realized how much anxiety/depression was damaging my life, at one point I had them so long, I didn’t realize it was abnormal anymore, I realized I had them, but didn’t realize how bad it really was, (for example putting off things I needed to do, seemed like laziness or boredom, but stemmed from fear of believing I was bad at said thing or feeling inadequate even if I was putting off learning said thing).

Unfortunately once stress piled on some more, and no healthy way of dealing with it, I put that dirty rag on the wound and let it it fester.

Always remember to not ignore these things and get proper help if it ever got too overwhelming, avoid going on auto pilot all the time to notice the warning signs.

And hundreds of attempts to get to this point.

I still have a long way to go, I used alcohol as a shield I suppose, a place I could hide where all my problems, failures and fears would disappear. I was happy in that place.

Until I wasn't anymore, I didn't get drunk to feel happy, I got drunk to feel nothing. I took pills to get there faster and further into oblivion. I woke up quite severely injured, covered in blood multiple times. 

So something had to change and here I am, 1 YEAR, days away. Can I say my life has improved? Maybe. I still have some deep issues to work through but time is a great healer and I feel like attacking them instead of running from them.

Can I say I'm happier and more secure? Definitely. I can't even remember the last time I wished I was dead. This comes across as flippant but it's not intended to be.

I'll be buying a 12 month coin because I bought a 6 month and a close friend bought me a customized 9 month coin but this will be the last.

I've lurked this group off and on for the last 2-ish years and reading other people's posts has been a huge motivator in the past. For a while now I've been teasing a full break up with alcohol and always let myself down so I'm here to post to help keep myself accountable and to hopefully provide reading content to others who are in a similar spot.

I'm a 32 year old woman and have been drinking since my late teens with periods of heavy drinking/binge drinking through out my 20s and it's been getting more regular since then. This has been near daily drinking, ranging from a couple drinks to 10+ drinks, all day ""sunday fundays"" (which is not inclusive just to sundays- also includes saturdays and other time off work), and taking the occasional ""break"" which can last a day, a few days, or several weeks. I have diagnosed anxiety and panic disorder, ocd, and have been dealing with an immense feeling of depression the last several months that just doesn't seem to want to lift. Obviously drinking not only doesn't help those things but makes it far more challenging to manage. Not to mention the awful loop that can happen of binge drinking > embarrassing myself or fighting with my partner > hangover and heightened anxiety the next day > fear of panic attack > take meds for anxiety > feelings of being a failure for causing that level of anxiety by drinking > start over knowing that you SHOULD NOT mix these meds and alcohol > rinse and repeat. 

My partner works in the beer industry and that's not necessarily a problem for me and sobriety (he's supportive, won't talk about it, won't bring anything home, etc if I ask). I've attended events and have stayed sober and times that I have been iffy I just stay home but I haven't been able to consistently get to that point of just stopping for good and I want to be there. A lot of our friends and the community we have are in the industry and a lot are problem drinkers, and will admit it. More friends have been opening up about ditching alcohol this last year and I'm so proud of them and I want to be in that club. I want to do the things that make me feel good and not do things that I regret later. I definitely don't want to be in the position I'm putting myself in of feeling regret and disappointment in myself while drinking and having those scary thoughts that come with it.

I started drinking at 19 and I was getting drunk at least once a week in the last 10 years. During this period my sex drive was extremely high. 

The weird thing is that my libido was also non-existent before consuming alcohol. As a teen I had zero interest in dating.

But now, it feels like everyone is just on my back. Its like they don't trust me to even leave the house anymore. I had a habit of drinking for no reason, so i 100% have a problem and will screw up my life if I dont stop.

 I just feel like other people having input and opinions on my recovery and criticism on how I am handling it just makes me want to drink more. its like, I can handle this ok? I have AA and the people there.  I have will power. I confided in you because I was desperate and needed your support. But please don’t comment on how I am approaching this. As long as I don't drink, stay out of it. I know they have my best interest, but it just feels like an insult when they are constantly like ""are you gonna drink?"" like no, Im NOT gonna drink because I cant!! and im not dumb. it was ruining my life and i value my life too much, but thanks for your concern (??)

My doctor says that I can still drink, but no more than an average of 2 units of alcohol a day and never more than 3 in one sitting. The thing is, I’ve been reading that even if it’s non alcoholic liver, even small amounts of alcohol can make it worse.  I know that if I hang with friends and have 3 beers I am going to end up drinking 15 so I think I’m just going to quit altogether.

I’m very much going to miss getting drunk with my friends on the weekend but I don’t want my liver to get worse, the excess calories are slowing my weight loss, and I’m sure the alcohol isn’t doing me any favors with my anxiety and depression in the long run.

I was going to post yesterday.. and the day before that.. and the day before that... but as my brain returns to normal I am realizing it just has a lot to say. I could post and then an hour later probably have another few pages worth of word vomit to shell out about any number of topics. I was a heavy drinker and benzo abuser for years and a 8 days ago I was waking up to drink 4 shooters until the LQ opened. Id head over there and grab a sleeve and 2 tall cans of seltzer, need more by 3 or 4 pm. Usually grab another sleeve so I'd have so left over for the morning. I cut all that shit out. Started coming here every day. I was fiending hard the first few days. I even had a tall can and 3 shooters ""just in case i couldnt bear it"". I forgot about those today. Grabbed them out of the cabinet and went outside to the dumpsters in the apartment complex i live in. Practiced my jump shot with the shooters and then got an idea to do something I havent done since I was like 10... I shook the tall can up as hard as i could for like 15 seconds and launched the fucker in the air as high as i could and watched it explode. It was awesome. I smiled, picked it up, went inside and cleaned some more shit I would have just let sit in the sink if it was me a week ago. I've been doing a lot of weird shit that I used to do when I was younger... taking a walk the other day i skipped a few rocks.. never would have occured to me while drunk. Finally getting my personality back and its honestly exciting. It feels like a bit of nostalgia mixed with meeting a new person that is actually cool. I of course still get anxious and depressed and realized that I absolutely drank to numb myself from how shitty and guilty I feel about my past, but man... It really does help to embrace the suck sometimes. Even today for instance, I should probably go out and be productive. I lost my job and just started collecting unemployment. However, I have accepted that money will be tight this month but I will get by. I choose to go get a milkshake, go to the gym, maybe go for a walk, who knows? I may never have another opportunity to take this time for myself and embrace the fact that I have nothing to do for a few days. I can still be productive for me. I can clean my house and my mind. I can try to feel healthy and eat well. If nothing else, I fail and I can never have to wonder ""what if""? I am willing to sacrifice a whole month of my life to be sober forever honestly. If it takes me being broke and collecting money from the government for a month to be truly sober, then I'm going to do exactly that. I will read, support others, support myself, take care of myself and others, and make sure I don't waste this time. I understand none of this makes sense and there's no cohesion to my post but thats just where my brain is right now and I know this community doesn't mind being a sort of pubic journal. Anyway, off to ACTUALLY DO THE THINGS I SAID I WAS GOING TO DO. Much love to all

My health declined, my motivation And work ethic went down the shitter, and the only thing I cared about was getting drunk and getting laid like they were the only two things in this life worth living for. My liver enzymes were a little high and I was generally in pretty bad shape. 

Fast forward 128 alcohol free days later, and all I can recall about those few months that I was sober was being pretty happy in general. I was waking up without hangovers, being a good friend, a good son, a good worker. I was motivated to do well at work and to hit the gym. I was looking good, eating good, and my doc told me my bloodwork was interestingly perfect (liver inflammation had completely come back to normal). I also started going back to school, and am doing well in it. 

Well sometime a month or so ago I had a weak moment to make the decision to “just have one”. What could it hurt right? Since then I started drinking regularly. It progressively got worse but luckily never hit the total rock bottom feeling. But today I woke up and decided enough is enough. I want to feel normal again. I want to be motivated. I want to be able to wake up without the anxiety of what I said or texted the night before.

Plus, I don't don't have to drive in the mornings so it didn't matter if I was a little hungover. (Har har har....)

It started steady, couple of bottles of beer or a glass or two of wine every couple of days until it really ramped up 6 months ago to a bottle of wine a night, then 2. Every. Single. Night. I can genuinely count on my hands how many sober nights I've had in the last 6 months.

But, pray tell, how do I know my liver may be damaged? I've no symptoms at all that would indicate somethings wrong.

2021-04-08 12:41:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mmvtcv/thinking_about_drinking_at_four_years_three/,"Thinking about drinking at Four Years, Three Months, Eight Days","I’ve been thinking about drinking lately.  These thoughts pop up every so often, and it’s never like I’m white knuckling when they come up.  I wouldn’t start drinking out of the blue without talking to my family and really thinking it through, but it’s definitely a high risk decision and I need to consider it carefully.

One of the bedrock beliefs to my sobriety has been “moderation is a myth.”  I still believe this to be true, but I’m beginning to question my status as an alcoholic, which lead me to two justifications in my mind for drinking again: (1) my life and myself are fundamentally changed since I quit, and (2) I want to enjoy drinks on vacation.

Regarding item (1), when I quit I was lonely, unsettled in a city without close friends, early in a career where I felt unfulfilled and making little money, and I had misconceptions about drinking that I have since found to be false.  I now realize that most people don’t drink every day and even fewer get drunk regularly.  My fiancé will drink maybe 4 to 7 drinks in a week, typically not drinking at all and never more than two or three at a time.  She is great for me because she keeps me structured.  A big reason I drank so much was loneliness, but I’m no longer lonely or unsettled and I have a more accurate view of how alcohol looks from a sober perspective.  HOWEVER, I have a lot more to lose now, which has pros and cons.  Pro because I don’t want to lose what I have, and that can help keep me in check.  Con because it makes drinking high risk if I can’t keep it under control.

Quite a few people have told me that they don’t think I was an alcoholic, that I was just young and immature.  I quit drinking at 27 so I do think there is some truth to that, but I also know that alcoholism runs on both sides of my family (neither parents are alcoholics though).  Overall, I think not drinking is incredible, it gives clarity of mind and allows me to feel mostly in control of my life.  So if I do drink, I don’t want to lose that control.

Regarding item (2), I want to drink on vacation.  I want to have a Guinness in Ireland, wine in Italy, scotch in Scotland, and mezcal in Oaxaca.  I am certainly aware of how drinking on vacation may leak back into my home life, so I am wary of the dangers.  In full disclosure, I had a glass of champagne while on vacation a couple weeks ago (it came free at a fancy restaurant and I drank it as an experiment).  It is the only drink I’ve had since I quit in 2017.  I didn’t order another drink, I wasn’t overwhelmed by a desire to drink anything beyond that one drink, and I haven’t had a drink since.  We went to multiple breweries afterwards during that trip, and my monkey mind wasn’t screaming for a drink at any point.  I don’t really know what to make of that little experiment, I don’t want to assign much value to it and I realize the danger of one drink.  

I know most of the responses here will be that it’s not worth it, and I’m generally in that camp.  I think sobriety is different for everybody, but it has a lot of similarities too.  Quitting drinking was the best decision I ever made in my life, and I’m afraid of losing what I’ve built over these last 4 years.  I don’t think it would happen immediately, but I fear the slow creep of alcohol abuse and it’s growing momentum.  For the immediate future I’m staying sober, but talking to people I love for their opinion.  Appreciate your thoughts.",25,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49590373}"

I am ""functioning"" but that only means I am good at pretending that I'm ok while accomplishing the bare minimum of things in life. I do want better for myself.

I had a phone call with my mother yesterday afternoon that has been itching at my brain ever since. She called and I didn't answer because I was in online class. (was going to call her back after) She then called my fiance and he came to tell me ""hey, your mom just called me. I didn't answer, but if she called me, it's probably an emergency."" I called her and she was unintelligible. She was hyperventilating and morose. Finally she was able to come out with the words ""I was so worried... thought you had died.. you told me you reeeeeelaappppppsed (sobbing) and I didn't know what happened to youuuuuuuu."" (less than 5 minutes transpired in between her missed call and my call to her.)

She was obviously under the influence of something. She was mumbling something about how I needed help and needed to stay sober. I asked her what was really going on. After MUCH prying, she admitted that for SIX WEEKS she has been throwing up after every meal and has had (tmi) blackish-bloody stools. I asked why she wouldn't go to the hospital. She says she doesn't want anyone to know. I called my brother (who just got a year sober) and he said he had just talked to her, that she wasn't upset but just intoxicated. I asked if this happens often and he said she's drunk almost every time she calls. Also, she was complaining about me drinking, while when she calls me she only complains about my brother spending money. 

I am a person that learns by example. My mother has always said the bothersome phrase ""do as I say, not as I do."" Well, I have half a mind to remind her of that. I love her, but I cannot be helped by someone that will not help themselves. I am working on finals, trying my best, and working on starting my family and my career. I am growing cold towards my mother and her hypocritical wailing. She has never admitted she has a problem and has never sought help, but always acted holier-than-though when I was hitting rock bottom.

Back in January 2012, I decided to quit. I made it about a month, and fell back in.  

Much of 2012 was me trying to quit, and failing.  

December 8, 2012, I joined AA.  

Feb 2013 I fell back in.  

April 7, 2013, I had my last drink of alcohol.  

I want to tell you that pretty much everyone I know struggled. Tried and failed, then tried again. So if you are in that boat, believe me, you aren't alone. You are part of a BIG crowd, all of us are just like you. There's 287,000 of us here on this sub, and tons more out in the wild.  

So **don't quit quitting**. If you try something, and it doesn't work, try something else. Join AA, or SMART, or Refuge Recovery. Pick up a hobby. Go for a walk.  

But **believe in yourself**. You can do this. Just because it didn't work *last* time doesn't mean that it won't work *this* time. And if it doesn't work *this* time, then make it work *next* time.  

You weren't born knowing how to walk, or talk, or ride a bike. But you didn't quit, did you, until you learned how. You learned how to throw a Frisbee, how to hit a softball, how to sink the 8-ball in the corner pocket. And even when you lost a game, you kept playing, because you wanted to win.  

Well, then, win this. Win your sobriety. Don't quit until you win.  

And when you DO win, and have a look at your life as it has transformed, you'll know that it's better than any championship trophy out there.  

I could humble-brag about what I have accomplished in the last 8 years, but I won't. I just want to assure you that living in sobriety is absolutely fucking fantastic, and if you could see what life looks like at 8 years sober you'd never even think of giving up.  

So don't quit quitting, and you will win.  

You.  
Will.  
Win.",389,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.48272976}"

2021-04-08 10:13:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mmsp9l/its_worth_it/,It's worth it.,"A year and a half ago alcohol sucked my heart and soul so dry that I couldn't take it anymore. I didn't want to die, but I didn't want to live with the void inside that alcohol kept making larger.

I went to my first AA meeting in a while. Years before I wasn't taking it seriously. I sat in the back row and nobody approached me, but I didn't raise my hand saying I was new either because I was sucked dry of any energy. I went up to two people and got their phone numbers.

The next few day withdrawal symptoms and anxiety were surging. I was also having to constantly look at the path that the tornado took from my binge. I called those two numbers and said I didn't need any advice, just tell me it's worth it and don't lie to me. They paused and said it's absolutely worth it. I asked if this was the right decision, to stop drinking. They said after years of sobriety that it absolutely was. So, I held fast.

They were right. A lot of shit has gone down in the past year and a half, but they were right. I broke things off with a girl two weeks ago and the change of pace from having someone there all the time to not having them there has made waves of emotions.

While thinking about it, a community of sober people was one thing that I was missing the other times I tried to get sober. Although I lost a relationship with a girl, I have a loving community of people that are like brothers and sisters to me from meetings. In times of light and dark, they're going to be there. When I'm going through something, the conversation with my sober community has so much depth because of the understanding of what they've been through and what I've been through.

To anyone who needs to hear it this:

* It's worth it.
* Don't detox without medical help. Withdrawal isn't going to be easy, but it's not meant to be agonizing. There's medical help available. Take advantage of it.

Fortunately, haha, life has delivered a series of hard knocks. I am being repeatedly forced to choose between facing conflict and ambiguity honestly or shrinking away with a fake, submissive smile and ultimately abandoning myself.

My father is an alcoholic and my mother is possibly borderline with a severe food addiction.

I ended a friendship... Or rather she ended the friendship after I finally called her out on her behavior a few months ago. It was the right thing to do. She's an alcoholic and is abusive to her partner.

I must confess that while I was drinking, I didn't know myself well enough to call her out sooner. I enabled her for ten years. She idealized me and gave me an identity.

I have never known fully my own thoughts and feelings. Now I am learning what may be the most important truth in my life. That is that I must love myself and know myself. I must be my best friend and ally. I am working toward getting to know this lonely and starved person inside me and bringing her back to life. Hell, I actually felt and expressed anger fairly healthily yesterday! That was the most forbidden emotion for me to express as a child.

This ended up costing me my full time job (though I hesitate to call it a 'real' consequence, because they kept it open for me while I attended a 'mediatative' retreat (rehab y'all) and I chose not to go back as it was highly demanding) and my relationship. The relationship was really only a consequence as we had a house together, and I had to deal with that. Otherwise I felt so much happier to be free of it.

It seems, however, that I attributed way too much of my substance abuse issues to said unhealthy relationship. Any time since that I have been overly stressed I have turned to alcohol or weed. The weed I've been free from for a month, but I always used that as a counterbalance to drinking too much. When the alcohol consumption rose; when I got a bloated stomach and awful skin, I switched to weed. Problem is, I suffer from a super fun sickness called cannaboid hyperemesis disorder. Basically, if I overload my THC receptors I'll vomit non-stop for a week. So alcohol is my brain go brrr choice.

You'd think by now something would have clicked. I've attended rehab; I liked it because I met some people who understood, I didn't like it because I felt they were trying to treat a symptom rather than the cause. I've been to AA - it feels like a cult, and I really can't give myself over to it. I've had therapy; the only one that really seemed to understand was a psychiatrist in the public health system, so naturally I never saw him again. The other psychologists seemed more interested in getting manicures, being paid, and helping me 'find god'.

I'm one semester away from graduating with my second degree. I have a relationship with someone I utterly adore and who has my back no matter what. The friends I consider my nearest and dearest have forgiven any sin or neglect and treat me like the person they know. Problem is, I don't know if I'm that person anymore. And I can't but feel like a fraud for hiding the anount I'm drinking.

My family definitely give me side eye every now and then. Sometimes they're right to, sometimes they're completely off the mark. Of course I use that wrongness to justify my own behaviour - 'how dare they' etc. I haven't spoken to my Dad in a couple of years now. He has his own issues (my well adjusted and traditionally successful siblings can attest to this) but I still miss him and want a relationship with him. He's my dad and he isn't any more fucked up than me, I just had the good fortune of an incredible support system.

In the last four days, I feel I've escalated massively (1litre of brandy, 3 bottles of wine, a dozen strong beer and several shots of whatever liquor I could find when things were running out) so now I'm also scared of withdrawal. Do I need to be? I'm drinking in the morning and only sleeping when the alcohol forces me to. Naturally, I'm exhausted, in addition to hating myself. 

I don't even know what I'm asking for here; advice, a damn good talking to, ostracisation, reassurance. I just know that I have things in my life that I desperately need, and want to hold on to. 

But somehow, I'm reaching for that drink every day.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Dear friends and fellow travellers,

When I think back on my early days of sobriety, there is one particular point I keep coming back to: Hope.

My last year of drinking I was kind of free falling after, you know, Life happened. Drinking was my way to numb it out, to escape - at the time I wouldn´t have approved of such words, but deep inside I knew that was it; I had been doing it for a decade.

The thing is - life´s struggles and alcohol came together to keep me down, and while I suspected it, I just didn´t see the connection clearly. I didn´t *want* to see it; I wanted numbness. I wanted to be left alone.

At some point though I realized that I was losing touch with my family and with myself, and that I was only feeding that dark cloud in my head. It was a downward spiral. I needed to get my mind back.

I didn´t see hope at the time. I thought I was bound to suffer. But when I stopped drinking, this amazing thing happened: The sun rose. Ever so slowly, the sun rose, and hope... was there. I just hadn´t seen it.

If I´m struggling today, I don´t crawl off into my den and numb it out like I used to. I´m not gonna lie, I want to, sometimes. But I don´t. I make an effort to do the opposite - get up, take a few steps, and stand in the sun. It´s there. I don´t always see it, but it is. Inhale grace, exhale gratitude.

To be clear: This is *not* me saying ""cheer up"" or ""everything will be juuust fine"". This is me saying, ""there is hope"". Hundreds of people confirm this every day by checking in, posting and commenting, offering to lend some of their hope to those of us who just don´t see it yet. Thank you, every single one of you, you´re the reason I´m here.

I always thought I’d be the type of mom with “help” so I could work full time. The thought of not having and excelling at my career is so foreign to me.

But he just says, ""Oh, that's not a problem."" And that was the end of it. He had a couple of ciders, left the last 1/4 of his cider on the table when we left. Put his arm around me as we walked and gave me a nice hug. He's sweet and cute too. Maybe we'll go out again. Regardless, sober dating is not as hard as I though.

I had bought a bottle of FRE champagne a week ago and was saving it in the fridge. 

WELL, I was so excited that I picked up the first bottle of champagne I saw, kept reading an article about the recent cannabis legalization and poured us two glasses. I go up to her and we try it and go “WOW this is amazing for no alcohol! It tastes exactly if not better than champagne!” And she looks at me and goes....babe. So I check the bottle and we realized our mistake, we laugh it off and throw out the remainder of the glass, and open up the FRE bottle. We didn’t miss a step :) 

Moral of the story? We had the courage to keep going and not beat ourselves up for an honest mistake, and we didn’t let it get us off the wagon.

I've noticed that after few weeks you start to miss it in different ways. You no longer long for that daily ritual of getting hammered and numbing out, but instead you recall the times where you would bookend the week with a few to wind down. Going to the pub to catch up with friends. Last time I had an extended sober period I reconciled these thoughts by telling myself I would eventually be able to drink again in moderation, but so far I haven't proved that to be possible. 

Made it through Easter, which I'm happy about. There were a few times I was fairly sure I was going to sneak out and grab a few cans with the intention of downing them while driving, but the idea of returning home drunk and then having to hide that from my family was just too revolting a thought.

I never realized just how much I was thankful for until given the opportunity to take over this thread. Writing on gratitude really forced me to rigorously examine my life, to delve deep into my self or selves, to regard my interiority with fresh, astonished eyes. It was oddly self-alienating because the notion of thankfulness is quite foreign to me, making these observations on gratitude seem as though they came from outside myself, the strange words of another related from a distant remove. Like the title of the new book by Haruki Murakami: First Person Singular. Writing these posts was a way of finding or maybe forging a new me. A me who is more alive to the idea that there is very much in this life of mine and in this world I inhabit that is beautiful. A me who is far less concerned with what I don’t have, and particularly with what I don’t possess, and more appreciative of what I do have and have had. A me who is more keenly aware of the infinite joy provided by my relations to others, to places, to the natural. 

And it goes without saying that I’m profoundly grateful for this community. For all the support and kind words, for the encouragement and inspiration it bursts with. It was in SD where my sober self blossomed. Where I developed the mindset and gathered all the tools and strategies for embarking on this journey. And when I crashed and burned last Friday night I discovered just how far I had come and how much I had grown thanks to sobriety. I would normally have wallowed in a fathomless pit of shame, allowing that darkness to pull me down further until I got lost in the downward spiral. But I understand why I drank that day and why I drank so much so quickly that, given my lowered tolerance, I very well could’ve hurt myself irreparably or worse. I’m glad it was catastrophic because I think that’s what I needed. To hurt. To be in severe pain. To think that I’m going to kill myself fairly soon if I keep it up. Out of that disaster came reaffirmation, a doubling down. This is why I’m keeping my badge. To remember that I’m still that person who made it that far. But also to remind myself, every day, where I could be had I not made that remarkably stunning mistake of taking that first sip that led to my bewildering reversion to some feral state. 

And so I’ve come to the end. It’s been such a joyful experience sharing my thoughts with you every week. I discovered so much about myself in composing these posts, and learned a lot about what it means to be thankful from reading your comments (actually many of the topics were inspired by you guys.) I’ll miss writing for this, Thursdays just won’t be the same. But the thread needs a new voice and perspective, and I look forward to reading of new ways to practice gratitude. Maybe if there was a recurring theme to my posts it was rejoicing in the endings of things, for they herald new beginnings with their abundance of rich possibilities.

My best friend from college was visiting a neighboring town and she invited me to come stay the weekend with her and her husband. I was excited because I hadn’t seen her in a couple of years and we don’t stay in touch as much as we used to. But I was also anxious because I hadn’t told my friend that I stopped drinking about 9 months ago. I used to drink a lot with this friend and I knew that she and her husband still drink quite a bit. 

For a few weeks before the trip, I kept going back and forth in my mind about what I should do. Should I just have a glass of wine with them? Should I tell her before the trip that I stopped drinking? Should I lie and say I’m taking some medication that won’t let me drink?  I didn’t want to ruin their vacation by not drinking! 

Right before the trip, I made the decision that I was not going to drink. I told myself that I can have fun and  be social without drinking and that I would feel terrible if I drank just to “fit in”. I also decided that I would just tell my friend the truth - that I stopped drinking because it made me feel like crap. 

So the trip came and that’s exactly what I did! I told her the truth and I didn’t drink all weekend and I still had a great time with my friend. I told her I didn’t mind if they drank (which was true) so they had their drinks and I had my club soda. And the next day her husband was talking about how he was having hangover anxiety and all I could think about was how I was so glad to not be hungover. 

Anyway, thanks to this sub for all of your support! It’s been such a big help.

I don't know who this story will help, but please read it as it helps me to tell it.
 I recently lost my girlfriend Katie to liver cirrhosis, or as they word it ""alcohol related liver failure/complications"" in November. She was 29. A wonderful human being, full of love, and would help anyone who needed it. But she was an insanely heavy drinker for 10-12 years. For most of that time she drank a half gallon to gallon of Bourbon daily. When I met her we were both able to kick the liquor to the curb, but we still drank a lot of beer. She eventually switched to hard seltzers, and I drank beer. We still each drink 15-20+ a day. There were points where we cut back, but it never lasted long. 
 She'd been through a couple close calls through the years where she was hospitalized. She was fully aware that if she continued to drink like we were, that  she could die. Her doctor told her for years, and she just didn't want to. She'd been through rehab, and been to jail, had counseling, but was just stubborn. The longest stretch of sobriety she had over the years was 7 months.
 She suffered from neuropathy in her feet. Couldn't really feel them all that well. She would tell me they felt asleep all the time. Late August of 2020 the neuropathy spread to her knees, and she could no longer walk very well. Her calf's caused her a lot of pain, and she said that it was like a constant charlie horse. This is when I started getting worried. No matter what me or anyone else said she refused to stop drinking. 
We had one last family get together with her family at the beginning of September. They were all talking to me on the sidelines, and we're beginning to worry themselves. After that visit things started getting progressively worse. She couldn't walk at all anymore, to the point she never left the bed. It was a constant argument to get her to go to the hospital. Her family tried as well. We even had a cop and paramedics try to convince her to go. I didn't know what to do anymore. I couldn't stop giving her alcohol either. If I had she would've had a seizure. She started to lose control of her bladder and bowels. I'd wake up to her peeing the bed, and she would think it was sweat. When she thought she was passing gas, it was black diarrhea instead. I had to start putting her in adult diapers. It was hard to change the sheets because I couldn't move her. Eventually she had peed soo much without realizing, that the entire mattress was soaked and dripping onto the floor. There were small lumps that would show up on her body, and after a day or two they would just turn into a huge bruise.
 I finally had convinced her in late October to let me wien her off. After weeks of arguing with her, missing work to try to help, changing diapers, doing my best to carry her to the tub, she finally said ok to stopping.  Well it was too late. The next night after I got home from work, I ran to the store to get some stuff we needed. Some veggie juice and teas for her, etc. When I got home, I made her a cup of tea, and we were just talked for a min. She went to take a sip of tea, and started coughing, then just stopped breathing. I yelled her name at her, and she wasn't responding. Called 911 as soon as I could, and performed CPR until the paramedics got there. They got her breathing again, and rushed her to the hospital. They told me at the hospital that when the paramedics got to the house she was dead, but they brought her back. She suffered brain damage, was on a respirator for 2 or 3 days. When she was breathing without the tube, she was definitely struggling. She couldn't talk to us, kept looking around like she didn't know what was going on. They said her liver was so bad that even if she had pulled though she would have made it another 1-3 months. And that was just the state her liver was in. With the brain damage, she would've just suffered for the rest of her life. After 10 days of going in and out of the hospital, with covid restrictions too, her family made the decision to put her in palliative care. She passed away the next night. 
We were together for almost 2 years. She was the one I wanted to make my wife. If we could've just cut the drinking out she might still be alive, and that dream may have came true. It's extremely hard on her family and I, even 5 months later. Even harder to not drink. But staying strong.

I suck at moderation. It's all or nothing with me -- a toda madre o desmadre. Either fucking awesome or a total mess. So I gotta keep alcohol entirely out of the picture.

My last day as a drinker was Sunday, the 4th. I decided that I'd had enough of the 1/5 of vodka per day and it was destroying my body, my work ethic, my relationships. Yeah, I really fell into a hole during the pandemic.This past Sunday was supposed to be my reset day. So the entire day, I drank only two beers. Queue that evening when I tried to go to sleep - shortness of breath, night sweats, any dream I DID have was nightmarish or anxiety riddled. I slept, I would guess, two hours of broken sleep Sunday night and had to be to work the next morning. Now, because of the pandemic, I learned that it was beneficial for me to separate work from home, so I rent an extra room from my brother and use it as an office space. Well come Monday morning, and turns out he had decided to do the same thing - also felt like shit. He had all the same symptoms I did and we were both puking all morning. The kind of violent alcoholic vomit that has sweat pouring from your face, and we look at eachother without saying anything - just quiet sympathy over here...So the day rolls on, I have a protein shake, drink some water, some detox tea, start to feel alot better. I enourage him to do the same. So he grabbed a glass of water and we went out on the front porch to smoke a cigarette. I sat down in my rocking chair and lit my cigarette and that's the last thing I remember. When I came to, I was in his recliner, covered in blood with a worried brother and two paramedics standing over me. They ushered me to the ambulance and sped me to the hospital.

2021-04-07 19:10:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mmegkx/former_moderate_drinkers_or_craft_beer/,"Former ""moderate"" drinkers or ""craft beer enthusiasts"" here? I want to hear your thoughts about quitting a hobby","Craft Beer was one of my most important hobbies. I drank many times a week but it was mostly tasting one or two beers. Used Untappd and Ratebeer to review beers like movies. On weekends I had my very own beer festivals with friends at pubs or at home alone tasting different kind of beers. Because of the weekends I allowed myself to taste more during the evening.

It was mostly moderated but after doing this for years I was wondering what's ""moderation"" anyway? It was fun being tipsy or drunk every now and then. Now when been sober for almost 8 months I haven't really given it a thought for a while. I kinda don't miss drinking but I kinda miss the the certain aspects of ""collecting"" beers and experiencing it. It was so big part of my life for 10 years and now it's gone. It's like missing a friend who died or been dead for a while.

Some people say they can drink one beer. I was able to do that too. But one left the awful numbness to my head because of alcohol. It kinda screamed for more every time. It's the addictive nature of alcohol as a drug. I rarely got too drunk but that's still alcohol folks.

I need to constantly remind myself about the million bad side effects that even ONE beer causes. Anxiety, dizzyness, stomach problems, money problems, losing interest, inability to focus properly, etc. etc. ""Different flavours"" and ""craft beer culture"" is not worth the trouble.

I have a very unhealthy relationship with drinking. Over the years I've created a hand full of really bad situations for myself, and my family.

I'm a high performing executive, mom, and wife, who will cram pack my day with productivity to justify bottles of wine, or a bottle of vodka. Definitely have blurry patches of life.

May 2020 I was working like crazy to keep my company afloat and drinking 8 mini bottles of wine alone in my office, then driving home. This is after a really close call driving drunk. This is after getting wasted in front of my staff to the point of laying on the ground asking them to leave me behind, puking, and finally them having to get my husband on the phone to tell me to get my shit together and let them take me home.

January 2021 my husband and I committed to no drinking. It was great, and easy, which is weird. I drank in Feb a bit but it was controlled and I lied to myself that I was better.

March 2021 my in-laws visit. The visit triggered something. The night they arrived I felt really anxious and I had an online conference to attend where I was a featured speaker. I would attend from my office. Before leaving my house I slammed probably six ounces of vodka. Drove to my office. Prepared three mini bottles of wine in my water bottle and presented at the conference. I watch the video now and it's horrendous. I'm so fucking blasted but I know what I'm saying and I think I'm the smartest person in the room. I have a drunk fucking smirk on my face like I'm so great that I can do it all. 

Since last month I've been fighting booze. I've tried to stop again and I can't. It's goddamned awful. I went through three bottles of wine on my own recently with our pod framily at our house. I can't humor hangovers because I have a toddler and a company to run and getting up at 6am after a giant fucking bender convinces me I'm fine. 

I know what's coming next if I keep this shit up and I'm terrified. I'm a card carrying expert in self sabotage. I had three mini bottles in my office on Monday during the day. After half a bottle of wine at lunch. Last night I hit the vodka and sent a bunch of stupid fucking emails where I think I'm being productive but I sound like a fucking asshole. I woke up at 2am after passing out at 9ish and have been up since then, its now 7pm.

I read one of your comments on another post that said, I only have to get through today. So I'm doing that. I ate a ton of carbs, have lifted all eating restrictions and letting myself cope with food. It's not ideal but driving drunk with my son is a big fucking no-go for me. I say that now, even though I did it Monday.

No one knows the level of my problem. My husband knows I've gotten fucked up in the past but he doesn't know about the mini wine bottles, or sneaking shots of Vodka. So I'm putting it here. I need accountability. Maybe if I tell all of you, it will help me.

I was so concerned about stopping drinking and the impact it would have on my social life.  In the past I have always enjoyed going to patios and having dinner and drinks.  Due to COVID it has been the main social activity for me since March 2020.   Last weekend I researched alcohol free beer.  It is amazing how many different brands there are today.  Last weekend I went out to my favorite patio for brunch. I am a regular at this place.  I asked the bartender what do you have that’s alcohol free.  They did have a couple to choose from.  It was great!  Made me feel like I was able to enjoy myself and “fit in” with the crowd so to speak.

I don’t see this as a trigger for me but an excellent way to continue my alcohol free journey and new life!  Pool parties, dinner with friends to hanging on patios and even concerts. This will become my go to for all of these events!!   I truly think this will help me feel like I’m not missing out by not drinking.

Just thought I would share in the hopes it might help others.

I'm in a good environment to quit drinking, my wife has never drank (no one in her family does, those that did have passed as a result of alcohol related issues or have quit), but generally she has always let me do my thing. I was a cheerful guy when drinking, but I had my moments over the years when I let her down. Too tired in the morning to be fun to be around, drinking more than others at gatherings, planning things around the ability to drink, I threw up in the bed once... lots more I could list, but you get the point.

I have been a binge drinker for 20 year, since I started. I have a problem with alcohol.

Although I never admitted that out loud, It's been in the back of my mind for years. I drink between 10 and 20 days each month. I'm mostly a light beer drinking, but they disappear quick. An 8 pack of light beer lasts about 2 and a half hours. If I stop at that, I still feel shitty but feel relieved the next day, that I did actually stop (usually because I only bought 8 and have been good about not driving to get more). Sometimes I drink 15+. Sometimes it's a quick 8 to get a buzz then a bottle of red. Vacations... well I can't even count how many I put back over the course of a week.

Anyway, I'm done with the ""take two weeks off then learn to drink moderately"" mentally. That will not work for me.

It has finally clicked, I realize the only way to evolve into the man I want to be is to quit all together. When I thought this way before, I could not maintain this ideal as I would think of a future scenario where I knew I would need to drink, and then let go of the thought of fully quitting.

Now I understand that in those scenarios, I will be the sober one, or one of the sober ones. I will enjoy my friends and family, even as they drink. I will not look at them and feel bad for myself that I cannot partake, as I do not actually want it anymore. I hate the feeling of needing more, more, more. I hate the feeling of coming down from it, if I do not happen to have more. I hate the feeling of ""not being whole"" when I have not had a drink in certain scenarios. What I want is to enjoy the time with friends and family, then drive myself home, then do something fun, productive or fulfilling before bed (rather than drink more by myself until it's lights out). I'll wake up the next day feeling ready to go. I'm prepared for the moments when it may get tough.

I downloaded ""alcohol lied to me"" and listened too it all in one day, when I had the window of clarity to make a change. It spoke to me, and I am following that plan to the T.

I have good people in my life and know I will be supported. Many will be relieved. Oddly enough, the biggest hurdle I'm dealing with mentally, is telling my parents. I only see them a few times a year due to location. They are great people, but they drink every night since as long as I can remember. They are not belligerent drinkers, but consistent with the habit. My dad is the classic whisky from 5pm to bedtime type guy, holds his liquor well, always up early and rarely shows any sign of a hangover... but I've always been shocked at how much he can down, night after night. My mom doesn't drink as much, but it's a crutch for her as well, and I can tell she becomes self conscious of it when others discuss not drinking.

With my mom, she internalizes other people's lifestyle improvements, feeling as though she should be making these changes as well, which is not my intent. She will support me, but her ego will feel attacked and she will likely feel very self conscious about her drinking around me (she has been self concious when she drinks around my wife, at times), even if I tell her this is only about me, not anyone else.

With my dad, when we get together, we drink late into the night and bond deeply. A big hug and off to bed. He has lost a lot of friends over the last few years. I know how much he enjoys our deep conversations and I'm one of the last ones that he's close with, that he can really tie one on with. This sounds silly, but I fear he will be losing one of his last drinking buddies. I'll do my best to open up without alcohol, but the comradery of ""one more, lol, don't tell your mother"" will be gone. I fear for how this will affect him and our relationship. He will support me, but somehow I feel bad.

This turned into a big ramble, I don't expect many to read it, but I felt the need to share with this community that I've been lurking in for a while. I have not yet told anyone about my decision, but knowing myself, and the clear mental shift that has taken place, this is the real deal and I'm committed to change.

It's a wakeup call for me. Life isn't what we think it is. We really have to live our lives to the fullest. Drinking is not how you do that. Drinking is a straight forward experience. You drink. You get drunk. You laugh. You cry. It's the drug and you don't feel anything or really get to know yourself or get to taste life for yourself.

I know that my deceased friend has had trouble drinking. I know that he has had trouble with other drugs too. He was the kind of guy who would start trouble with people and I think to escape that side of himself he would drink.

You really have to deal with yourself right now. Someone said to me recently ""you are here for a good time, not a long time."" And so in order to have the life I know that I deserve I have to deal with the cards I've been dealt and try to make a new hand.

I don't know if that will ever happen but I know it absolutely won't happen if I'm drinking. I'll never get to fall in love again. I'll never get to grow with a person again. Spending my nights drunk will wipe out the possibility. Living life with a constant undetectable hangover that I got used to will wipe out the possibility. Everything will turn grey and I'll be counting down the days until I end up like my friend.

It began when I was younger as getting wasted at clubs in order to overcome my shyness and be social with others/meet people. I always blacked out. 

Now, I am 31 and in the last 5 years I really began to see this as a problem. My anxiety got worse, my weight kept creeping on, my mood swings were severe and I'd make so many bad choices while under the influence - like driving. I am engaged now and spoke openly about my difficulties with alcohol and my fiance supported me. At the beginning I would still drink, but hide it from him. He'd inevitably realize I was drunk and we'd talk the next morning, after my black out and I'd have my anxiety attack and apologize. Then I'd do a week sober, honestly because I'd be so turned off/anxious. I'd hate myself so much BUT when that self-hate wears off and you feel ""normal"" again it's easy to think, ""today's nice and sunny out can't wait to drink and just feel good"".  I convince myself, I'll stop before it's too much. But I never do. I never do! And I have years of proof to back me up but I insist to myself that no, THIS time will be different.

A few months ago, I went 6 weeks without drinking. But never more than that. It's always like a weekend binge and then done. Beginning of COVID was worse, it was a daily thing cause I was just home everyday but since returning to work that's been much better and its back to the weekly basis. Sometimes I skip a weekend. But when the craving hits, I'm toast. Then, my anxiety hits HARD the next day, and the way I feel the next day has been worse and worse. I have resorted to self harm for how intolerable my feelings get when I am in that morning-after state. I am a useless lump the entire day and I just think of the friends or family I disappoint when I do this shit. Especially since I have made it known that I want to remain on wagon. It's humiliating. More so when I do really awful things like drive. It happens almost each time. And before when things were shut it was easy, my fiance made sure I couldn't get my keys. I just figured oh I'll buy at the dep, get a head start on the bottle on my way home but that turned into taking detours to get home so I could get more in before going home and that turned into driving for an hour, downing it. It's disgraceful.

So here I am, feeling anxious and hopeless that at 31 I still haven't overcome this nonsense and making bad choices. How will I ever hope to have a child when I can't even manage this?? Can you relate? Anyone? I feel so stupid and alone. Like I am broken and can never be done with this. I want to quit smoking and lose 60 pounds too. I feel like I just need to overhaul my health and it's overwhelming.

My meeting is over. It was hard as they went through the chronology of “incidents” and some details I was previously unaware of. Difficult to hear, and I kind of wish I didn’t know those details but it is probably for the best. They will allow me to return to work after receiving a letter from my addictions counsellor that details my plan to maintain sobriety and his opinion on when I can return.

I am a lawyer. They made some other points about how they can’t protect me if the law society becomes involved or if the bench refuse to allow me to appear in front of them. Sobering for sure, I am going to write it all down so I can revisit it in the future if I need to remind myself of the potential consequences of returning to drinking.

I don’t know what my counsellor will say regarding when he thinks I can return to work, but that is somewhat out of my hands so I will accept whatever he recommends.

I’m almost at 13 days sober! Feeling good, but I stopped drinking this time after being caught under the influence at work. They’ve already given me a month to go to rehab last July, after another incident.

I’m getting paid and have been assured I won’t be fired but have not been allowed back to work and have a terrifying meeting with my bosses tomorrow to discuss “what they need from me”. I have so much anxiety and this is exactly the type of meeting I would normally not want to be sober for. I will stay strong though and have a session with my counsellor before the meeting tomorrow. Wish me luck, I’m hoping they will let me return to work but it’s out of my hands and I have to accept that I guess.",18,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.43611205}"

I feel like that level of drinking doesn’t have a substantial impact on my physical or mental health but I have a hard time sustaining it. A few beers on the weekend turns into having a few left over so I drink them on Monday and then it slips further and I’m drinking on my own almost every night. Then before I know it I’m picking up a bottle of Jameson on the weekend again, starting the next week hungover and depressed and unable to see a reason to stop/cut down.

I’m wondering if I could stick to a rule of just never drinking on my own ever but I don’t know.

I'd planned on kicking, getting past the worst of it and then telling my spouse. Mostly for selfish, shame filled reasons. I figured this would be a week or two to get this behind me, then when I was all better, sit down and let it all out. 

Fuck, was I wrong.  

I couldn't manage it alone anymore. Trying to pretend like my brain wasn't upside down and backwards to keep things under control was exhausting. Verbalizing my addiction to them, saying the words and admitting the lies and sneaky behavior that hid my decent into the hell I've created for myself was liberating. 

It helped, but 6 weeks out and I'm still riding the roller coaster rails. I can feel anything between ""slightly better than normal"" to ""feeling like a bird trapped in a cage and thrashing against the bars"" 5 or 10 times a day.

 It's like a sine wave and someone keeps fiddling with the amplitude and frequency every day.

During the high side, I can't fathom my brain ever feeling bad, and have no idea how it could ever be that way in the first place. Nothing negative lives there and I just feel... ""normal"" 

On the low side, I'm a mess. Unable to concentrate, tense, anxious, irritable, feeling trapped in my head and on the verge of panic. The lows last way longer than the highs.

I ""think"" there's improvement? Marginally... The lows are getting slightly more manageable I think. 

And there's no physical or emotional reason for it. I don't have a stressful job, relationship or life. In fact, it's pretty chill. There's nothing obviously wrong with my body, no pains or worrysome things. It's like my brain is bracing itself for some imaginary catastrophic event that never comes. 

I dunno. I'm still glad I'm not drinking. And I'm glad I allowed myself to let my spouse in and help. This is an impossible mountain to climb alone.",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4834786}"

1. I have chronic back pain that makes it hard to enjoy any of your typical day-to-day activities. I'm literally in constant pain.. Except when I'm drunk. When I'm drunk I'm kinda numb so the pain is pretty much non-existent and I can enjoy myself. Needless to say, this temporary comfort has snowballed into me consuming waaay more alcohol than I'd like.
2. The second thing is a ""numbed"" mental state due to SSRI's. I'm no longer on the things, but they pretty much killed my motivation, drive, and any amount of enthusiasm I had in the world. Since I've been off of them, it seems like the only time I can actually find pleasure in simple life and get a kick out of things is when I'm intoxicated and ""hanging lose"".

I feel like these two things complement themselves in a very damaging way and I'm having a hard time combating it.

I know progress isn’t linear, intellectually that is, but the emotional component leads to me beating myself up. I’ve been struggling with different shades of problem drinking for years and it just became more and more of an issue as my late twenties turned into my early thirties. I’m about to be thirty three in less than a month which to me is creeping pretty close to my mid thirties. 

Here I am, still falling back into my old ways of drinking to avoid emotion and yet also feel it too. Drinking to be social and escape the feelings of loneliness. Not knowing what to do with my free time so just drinking away the days. Drinking to celebrate and drinking after a bad day. Just always drinking. 

Now it’s really taking a toll on my body and mind. I’ve gained far too much weight as of late and my body is sluggish and tires easily. Not to mention the vanity side of it which just eats me up and makes me feel so ugly and unlovable. My mental state isn’t the best to begin with and I’ve tried to cover it over with booze but now the hangover backlash is just getting worse and worse. Not to mention the meds I’m taking are completely mucked up if I’m drinking on them. I’m just exhausted, always. I can barely roust myself to get out of bed let alone function. I know a fair amount of some of these symptoms stem from some significant depression but we all know booze doesn’t help that. No matter how many times I’ve tried to make it. 

What I’m really struggling with the last little bit is whenever I get sober my emotions are just off the damn charts. I got so angry, so so so angry the other day. With reason but shit. I didn’t know what to do. I tried writing and then just went into the bottle. Obviously that didn’t help. When I’m sober I’m also very touchy and fragile and tend to cry/get emotional over everything. That’s a hard one to handle as well. Then I get stuck in the habit portion of it too. Most nights I don’t even want to drink. No cravings, no “reason” it’s just what I do and it turns into an automatic action. 

My sleep has been shit and this is also taking its toll. Another reason, historically, why I drank. To shut my mind off and sleep. Or “sleep.” When I sober up I can’t sleep. I know that’s not new. But it just eats at me and makes me more emotional and have less “willpower” to say no to drinking. When I drink to sleep I don’t sleep well, that’s a no brainer. Or I get so ramped up by the booze instead that then I “need” to smoke weed to get to bed. Then I’m cross faded as shit and am a total zombie the next day. 

I know I need to take better care of myself. Quitting booze just takes the, well I guess beer goggles, off of my life and puts it all into a very bleak reality. Like everything emotionally comes crashing down, I have to face the facts on my mental health, I realize my body is hurting and tired and in need of help, I realize I’m not really going anywhere in life. Then on the other hand I get so ramped up and excited and try to take everything on and everyone and just burn myself out. Or get frustrated that two days of sobriety doesn’t solve it all. Irrational. I know.

I had many undealt-with traumas that led to me coping with a handle a day. The day my sober journey started was when I heard of someone who I saw as a pivotal part of me becoming who I was as a person (in a good way) had died in a gunfight.

I was a bully in middleschool, unintentionally, but intentions don't matter. I used to tell a kid who I thought was obviously gay that he was gay. What's worse is that my Christian values meant I didn't say this in good interest. 

Fast forward a couple years to our senior year of highschool, after becoming actual friends, and I had a heart to heart admitting I hated that I said those things to him and that I was sorry that I ever put him down.

We didn't really talk after highschool, but I think of him as the one person who had me change my views on gays and Christianity. (Nothing wrong with Christianity unless it made you openly hateful). He was a cornerstone of the better person I had become.

Eventually those past traumas worsened with the addition of new traumas. I decided to give up and drink myself to death. The worst part was that my best skill in life was hiding how drunk I actually was. I once had a friend ask me to drive the car because he was too drunk and I had to remind him I drank the same shots he did plus several more. Just because I didn't slur didn't mean I wasn't drunk. I did this for a few years until I found out my friend had died and... that's when I knew I didn't actually want to die. My  best friend drove me to a get-together where I asked him to bring me to the hospital after. We get in, nurse says it won't take too long because I didn't seem that drunk. Then I blew a .40 and had to wait over 12 hours before I could be admitted. 

I got out of the hospital having been sober for a while when a friend asked if I would ever drink again. I told him that of course I'd drink again, I just had to learn how to drink responsibly. After thinking it over, and having said that to someone, I knew I should never drink again. If I was already willing to make excuses to drink then I would definitely make the same excuses to drink even more. That logic solidified in my brain where I would never allow myself another drop of alcohol. 

It's been years. I still struggle, but I will not drink with any of you lovely folks today or any day in the future.

Just checking in to say I'm having a really rough day. I was doing decent in sobriety for a bit, hitting AA meetings and even got a sponsor. Then I started skipping meetings, kinda just blew off my sponsor, and slipped back in Feb.

I thought it was only for a bit but I'm now assessing everything and I can't seem to remember much of March. Spent way more money than I thought. Had no plans other than to get through a day. Those days stacked up pretty quick.

My depression is getting worse, culminating in some really dark thoughts recently. My anxiety is horrible. I'm extremely off my game, making even job interviews difficult (which I really need). Making tons of excuses to drink, and doing nothing else. Isolating a lot. Getting paranoid. Blowing off responsibilities. Keeping a ton of secrets. The works.

I'm incredibly ashamed of myself. My family was proud and still thought I was doing so well. I convinced myself I still was too. I was wrong.

I think I have to come clean to them tonight, which I am dreading. And starting to think I should seek some actual treatment (which I can't afford). But I can tell it's getting bad and the cycle won't stop until I intervene in it. But something has to (and will) change, one way or the other.

Thought about sitting out in the sunshine and enjoying a beer or two with my food. I had already cleared my day and I “deserved” it after getting the vaccine.

But I played the tape forward. I already was starting to get a headache, and thought about how much worse it would be if I drank. And if I had one or two, I’d want more and be sour about not being able to. I thought about how much it would cost (likely $40-50). On top of all this, I’d have to hide everything from my truly wonderful husband. It became crystal clear that blowing all of my hard work these last few months/years was so not worth it.

So I came home, took a shower, drank water, and ate something. The desire to drink has completely evaporated and I’m indulging in Legally Blonde instead.

I did something i never considered doing to deal with my cravings and anger. I popped my headphones in turned on my music and just ran. I decided I was gonna run as hard as I could until my legs felt like fire and I was too tired to think of drinking.

Next thing I know I have beaten my fastest mile time I have ran longer and further than ever.

I'm a 33 year old male in moderate shape. I dont workout but I'm also not fat. 


Ive been a daily night time drinker for 10+ years but I didn't consider myself a heavy drinker until a few months ago, when I was waking up with a shot to stave away the shakes and pukes and having little nips throughout the day until I could let loose and have a few real drinks at night. Did this for around 6 months and finally got caught by my fiance and it was the booze or her. I chose her.


I promised her to never day drink again and to limit drinking to only the weekends. But first I told myself I would dry out for a few months to get into a better head space to try and moderate my drinking. 


I was coming off a pretty hard bender due to some family drama the week before so my first day sober was an absolute nightmare. Hard-core body shakes, puking constantly, couldn't hold down water let alone any food until the next night.


Second day was better, slight shakes, could get down food and water but felt light a full grown man was standing on my chest, my heart was beating out of control with lots of anxiety.


Third day was better, shakes were there but manageable, chest still felt heavy and anxiety continued. 


The next few days were the same with varying degrees but I just felt like death. Heart beating out of control. Lots and lots of anxiety. 


Day 5 I'm in an ok mood, driving home from work and start feeling funny. Dizzy. I pull over to a store to walk around and clear my head and not be on the road. I feel better, get back in the car and start driving. After about 3 minutes in the car I realize I'm totally zoned out not paying attention to the road, my heart feels like it's about to explode, pain in my left armpit, then arm, then both arms and hands go numb and its starting to be difficult to see clearly all within a few minutes. Luckily I spot a 24hr ER and pull in. I walk in and say I think I'm having a heart attack and they of course jump to action. 


It wasn't a heart attack. This is speculation from the ER doc, I still need a cardiologist to confirm, but my heart, from anxiety and vitamin deficiency caused by a dependence of alcohol flew my body into shock and my heart into PVCs (premature ventricular contractions). Basically your heart tries to pump blood backwards, and halts the flow. Everyone gets these, but rarely, I was getting several per minute. My blood pressure was 190/130, shaking violently, sweating sheets, and could barely talk. They gave me a sedative and monitored me until I was back to normal. 


I have an appt with my main doc tomorrow to get everything checked out.


Tldr: if you're a heavy drinker, please, don't try to do it on your own. If your body experiences anything more than what a typical drinkers hangover would be, seek help. I felt like death for 2 days and ""fine"" for 3 days after my last drink before it caught me. It can be life threatening.

As a teenager, my house was the party house as parents didn't give a fuck and I only cared enough not to get yelled at too much. 

I remember my dad giving me my first drinks as a preteen and proceeded to get really sick and have to vomit in the bathroom to the chagrin of the other people there...something something becoming a man. 

As I grew up, I never really dealt with my past effectively and drank and partied my way through high school while still maintaining a GPA to keep me in the top 5% of the class. Still I had no direction and only wanted validation from my divorced parents (bipolar mom & narc, alc/drug dad) so off to a top ten engineering school I went. Well I found the alcohol and parties there too and essentially partied too much to maintain the rigorous academic pursuit needed in that I environment. I would also come to meet my now ex wife during a night of binge drinking bottom shelf bourbon at one of these said events. 

After a severe mental breakdown and slipping grades I decided I needed to refocus and escape that environment. I went home to the place of so much past trauma and spent as little time as possible there. Working non stop, going to the bars, and attending a state school in the city or going to their satellite campus near by. I also had my long distance girlfriend who gave me hope and attention while also causing massive psychological damage with cheating and gas lighting.  To cope I managed my afflictions by drinking and partying only after work functions or early in the morning on my days ""off"" where I knew I could just vibe. Riding the train into the city while only moderately inebriated or working the restaurant/hotel scene with a buzz on a slow day was the norm. 

This progressed and eventually I was smitten with the rollercoaster of emotions my ex and I inflicted on each other and as I started focusing on my future I decided I needed a change. I slowed down on the drinking, graduated college with honors, still drank but only twice a week, took on a rigorous internship and tried to parlay that into a job in the capital but it did not pan out. I tried to transition to the army and punished myself with exercise to get in shape to do so but due to childhood issues (accident and asthma) they said no. 

Later on, after these failures, I would keep grinding, working, drinking, and falling further down the rabbit hole with my ex wife. We drank soo much together. When we were long distance, we were either blitzed on the phone with each other or when visiting, it was a non stop party. When we moved into together full time, drinking was the only way we would not fight and have a good time together. I think our traumas were somewhat paralyzed when we drank which made things tolerable. 

However, when sober she would further escalate things and try and keep me under wraps and cut me off from family and friends. I would listen and just keep getting more and more isolated. I numbed the pain with my addiction and got to the point of it becoming cheaper just to manufacture my own high quality beer rather than  buying cases of it a week. I still bought hard liquor though but getting into a distillery job was a dream at that time. 

Isolated and drunk, things came to a head when one night she had been day drinking and I had come back from running errands and the liquor store and she starting getting violent and demanding access to the gun cabinet. (Due to another alcohol fueled weekend where there was a major fight, I started going to therapy after that one and the therapist advised locking all of the weapons and documents in the cabinet.) Well she takes a sledge and then starts threatening me and as I dont acquiesce she starts taking the sledge to the cabinet. I call the police and that marks the end of that chapter. Almost two years to the day actually...

I then proceed to go on an alcohol fueled bender for 8 months as the trauma power vacuum and contentious divorce proceedings pulls me into all kinds of crazy fraternization, drinking, partying, more binge eating etc. As the holidays roll around in 2019, I am staring down the barrel of one of my pistols after a drunken binge the day before just contemplating ending it all. I think back to the other times I have had a gun in my mouth instead of a bottle... I just can't do that to the family I am renting from and go to sleep.

A day or two later, my cousin gives me man's search for meaning. I had been attending DV therapy and individual therapy during the past 8 months before this while also doing independent therapy but none of it sticks. Well I devour this book and something inside of me clicks. Then fortuitously, a friend challenges me to a 10 mile run. After 8 miles while weighing 345lbs my body just quits on me. I am laying on a bench in January in Fairmount park staring at the blue sky contemplating what am I doing with my life. 

I spend the next few weeks recovering from that run and something just clicks. Some kind of dormant self love, all of the therapy, and just everything I had been attempting and dealing with just comes around and my conscious says you know... you keep doing the same thing over and over expecting different results...How about we try something different. 

So I start running. I want to get to a half marathon. I must lose weight to effectively do this. In doing so, I slow down on the booze...Every night turns into a a few times a week, turns into dropping the booze to only weekends. To then once or twice a month...to now... 

I've since run that half marathon. I've run over 30 half marathon plus distances in the past 8 months now. I've run a full marathon and over 1000 miles in less than 10 months. In the 14 months since last February I've lost 157 lbs and work his given me new opportunities beyond my wildest dreams. My divorce has been finalized. And I finally am starting to feel free of the grips of alcohol and its draw and the trauma of my childhood and marriage. 

Its been 60 days since the last day I was peer pressured to drink by colleagues. 60 days since I gave in to that urge to fit in. To be the party house kid again. To be that *guy* and be relaxed and mellow and ""fun"". Well 60 days of complete clarity after nearly a year of only drinking once or twice a month back from daily binging the year prior has opened my eyes. 

Being sober me is awesome. Drinking tea, water, fru fru mocktails, or coffee when at a bar then belting karoke sober is pretty dope. I hope to run a faster full marathon this year, a triathlon, several of those crazy obstacle course things, and stay sober while doing it. I salute all of you who made it this far. This was just for me, to keep me honest and remind myself where I am but I felt compelled to share on day 60 of my complete sobriety. 

Keep trying everyone and keep moving onward and upward.

I've been sober for almost four weeks (tomorrow!) and have been trying to note and appreciate my small victories. I figured I would share one with y'all!

last night, I decided to repot one of my plants and create a new hanging planter for it. usually, I would be doing this activity about a half bottle of whiskey in with another drink by my side. inevitably, I would wake up to a huge mess of strewn soil and broken terracotta shards. 

well, this time, I still made a huge mess. but the improvement was in how I dealt with it! as I was finally hanging my finished planter above my desk, my hand slipped and the plant fell hard. I broke my favorite desk lamp, antique ceramics, and beautiful succulent that my partner gave to me. 

I started to bemoan how stupid and drunk I was until I realized...I wasn't. the memory of how drunk me would react to this surfaced, but the feeling didn't. usually I would spend the rest of the night berating myself about this, catastrophizing about the things I broke, and becoming a ball of rage. last night, I was able to just call it a bummer, clean up the mess, and go to bed in peace.

 when I was drunk, I always had to blame someone, usually myself, for small misfortunes. with a clear and sober mind, I'm really enjoying building confidence and trust in myself. I can recognize that every little thing that goes wrong isn't necessarily my fault and, regardless of fault, I can fix it!

so anyway...I will hang that plant, I will fix my knick knacks, and I will propagate that succulent! and most importantly, I will not drink with you today : )",21,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.54624104}"

I was hearing thousands of voices telling me to kill myself, with ""someone"" live streaming my every move to thousands of people. It got to the point where I couldn't take it, and told my dad to take me to the hospital. He agreed immediately, since he knew I was losing complete control. I got moved into a mental hospital for 7 days and got professional help, which I recommend to anyone needing help. At first, I tried escaping many times, but then calmed down with their medication and started reading books there. The first unit I was in was mixed with violent and non-violent patients, jammed into an open area. Then, I was moved into a ""good boy"" unit and got better help. This unit had motivational speakers, group talks, and less strict rules. They taught me life advice and hooked me up with a social worker, therapist, nurse and psychologist. I'm a new man now, and I recommend seeking professional help to anyone that needs or wants it.

Here are some takes, it’s worth the read. Link is below.

Embry and Lippman (1987) considered that magnesium deficiency plays an important role in the alcohol-withdrawal system. There are data that show that magnesium administration decreases the intensity of symptoms from the withdrawal syndrome. The alcohol induces hypomagnesemia (magnesium deficiency) and increases urinary magnesium loss. Low concentrations of ethanol deplete free intracellular magnesium (Babu et al., 1999). Consistent with Shane and Flink (1992), we believe that magnesium deficiency is not only involved in the intensity of alcohol withdrawal, but also in the development of alcohol dependence.

…We consider that the ability of magnesium to reduce addiction to different substances and reduce the intensity of addiction to different substances is essentially related to the association of two different factors – its ability to produce a moderate stimulation of the brain reward system (Nechifor et al., 2010), and its capacity to reduce the activity of glutamatergic substances, importantly involved in compulsive use disorders.

Compulsive drug-taking behaviour is an important characteristic element in addiction. The existence of a strong reinforcement activity is a determining factor for drug addiction (Koob and Bloom, 1988). Reducing the intensity of dependence on different compounds involves reducing their reinforcing proprieties. Response- reinforcement learning is dependent on NMDA receptor activation (Kelley et al., 1997). We consider that magnesium reduces reinforcing proprieties of different compounds by action on these NMDA receptors.

Here’s the source https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507260/#ch24.Ethanol_dependence

Also important: It shouldn’t be just any kind of magnesium. Magnesium glycinate, taurate and malate have best bioavailability (absorbed by gut), they can access the brain and have brain and mental health benefits. Where as magnesium oxide, citrate, carbonate or sulfate work better as laxatives. Magnesium doesn’t absorb well with soda, coffee or tea.

I didn’t go to work drunk in the mornings, I didn’t have a water bottle with me at work... I just drank far too much after work and had to take one sick day a month (or so) for a hangover day. I knew I was in trouble, but because I was managing, things were fine, right?

Going remote broke me. I was drinking as soon as I was up at 6:30am and didn’t stop. This would go on for weeks at a time - there are full work days, with meetings and project deadlines, that I do not remember. How I got away with it is beyond me. I’m sure someone knew, or had a sense that I wasn’t fully present, but no one said anything.

I’ve been on and off sober recently, but fully committed now, and it’s amazing to see how much better I am when I don’t drink. I remember meetings with my manager and team. I take notes. I’m actually learning and retaining knowledge and skills. I’m not terrified of being confronted about my lack of productivity... it’s truly a better path.

I haven't gone back to alcohol, but I'm stuck. For the first several months I was making incredible progress: I managed to quit cigarettes, completely change my diet, totally taper off benzos, and start working out regularly. I have not, however, been able to launch the work thing I'd said I'd do or return to any kind of stable work at all. I was only semi-employed for years, barely scraping by and living off savings due to my addiction. I'd hoped I'd be completely on my feet by now, earning good money, confident, and happy. But I just cannot move forward with work stuff. I don't know if the stuff I thought I wanted before is the same thing I want now. The work I do involves a tremendous amount of pressure, dealing with the hatred and anger of others, as well as fear. However, part of me is drawn to this work. I know not everyone can do it. But I also dread it so much, and I dream of an alternate universe in which I do fashion design, or interior design, or look at beautiful things all day -- things that are not connected to the darkness of my current career. One big reason why I drank was to dull the pain of the work I do.

On two separate occasions in the past few months, I've folded and gone and refilled a prescription for ritalin. While it is not one of the primary drugs I kicked this time, it's something I have abused in the past and that I abused this time. I didn't spiral completely out and go drink and get more, but I did go days in a row on the stuff. Of course, I got the ritalin to try to focus on work, which I just cannot seem to do. 

I was ""stuck"" professionally before I got off alcohol and I still feel stuck. I'm very slowly depleting my savings and I don't want to do that for much longer. I'm sort of frustrated because while sobriety has brought so much clarity, I'm still not entirely clear on this. I just feel like I'm really in an uncomfortable place with my sobriety: I'm vaccinated now, things are opening up, I've been invited to spring events outdoors... I'm a little concerned that this is a do or die moment. 

Is it normal to feel so confused seven months off alcohol and sedatives?

Not had a drink in 50+ days. Enjoying the fruits of sobriety - sleeping better, thinking clearer, more present, mindful, productive, mood has stabilised, less anxious, less prone to my usual depressive dives, and as my SO tells me, a whole lot nicer to be around.

I have no desire to purchase or drink alcohol. I have plenty of cravings here and there but not experiencing that now. I just feel the inescapable urge to go to the shop and buy what seems to have replaced my booze purchases - snacks/junk food and energy drinks.

I'm sure there's been other examples of old booze-related behaviour hanging around but that's the one I'm experiencing right now...

Do other folks have experience of this? Is it normal? Just a typical sign of someone who has an addictive personality/substance use issue? Does it fade in time? And finally I guess, if it doesn't create issues, can I just stop worrying about it?",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.46405375}"

Second, I will say that it's been a lot of work. Late last year, I was able to cut back on coffee which helped cut back on my anxiety. I wound up increasing my coffee intake over the last 6 weeks since I was so busy, which led to stress. I'm back to trying to taper that off. Also, pot has been helpful for my anxiety, but I'm trying to taper way back on that, too - for now, I'm trying to reduce it. But, historically, when I cut back on coffee, that also helps with my anxiety, so the two go hand in hand. 

I've gained weight which has been disappointing. I had hoped that quitting drinking would help me lose weight, but early on, I realized how much more I craved carbs without alcohol. I'm working on this now - I've restarted intermittent fasting, which has worked really well for me in the past.

I'm trying to prioritize working out. I used to really enjoy kickboxing, but fell off of it when all of the gyms around here were closed due to the lockdown. I wound up buying a punching bag which is both a fun exercise and just great to use when I feel stressed and want a drink.

This subreddit has been helpful. However, I feel like I need to join some sort of support group. I've looked into AA, but it just felt like it wasn't for me. I'm continuing my search. 

I'm not going to sugarcoat this though - this is hard. I know that I feel better overall not drinking than drinking.  I just started seeing a therapist, so I'll see where that goes. I do have days where I feel like a complete failure. However, one thing that I haven't experienced is the deep shame I felt when I drank too much. That's a plus. I'm just taking this one day at a time to slowly improve myself.",59,{'lockdown': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.44363683}"

I started looking and feeling like crap. I'm 33 and a mother of 4 also a nurse but I haven't worked in over a year bc my kids were home. I was so addicted and so afraid of withdrawals.

I'm about a week in but I still haven't had a solid poop. The first few days I didn't eat anything. I couldn't. Now I'm feeling better but I still get itchy skin and I haven't had a good poop in so long lol. I know TMI but I would love a good poop. Tired of feeling a little queasy all the time but the itching at night comes and goes. Good thing is I don't think I could stomach alcohol even if I wanted it.

It truly is a magnificent community. I love how people here can have different approaches from one another for how to deal with their alcohol consumption and still remain supportive of each other. I also think it's remarkable how almost all of the posts that come up on the subreddit get responses from someone. 

Anyway, to get to the point of why I am making this post. Right now, I am 24 days into my decision to not drink. I had a bit of a revelation this morning about my relationship with alcohol - I realized that drinking makes it extremely easy to ignore and procrastinate dealing with issues in your life that you need to get sorted out. These issues can end up piling up over time and causing significant consequences down the line when they might have been easy to deal with initially. 

To give a little bit of context to why I came to this realization, I work as a server/bartender. I really love my job, but one of the aspects that is difficult is that I am on my feet all day. My feet have very high arches, so I have to wear orthotics or else I can end up experiencing some intense foot pain. Recently, I started noticing that my feet were beginning to get more sore, so I booked an appointment to see if I need new ones. The appointment was this morning, and it turned out that not only do I need new ones, I am at risk of getting plantar fasciitis if I do not start to do stretches for them on a daily basis. It's going to cost me around $500, but within 10 business days I should have new orthotics that should make work significantly easier.

Now, this might seem like a relatively straight forward story. You might be wondering what it has to do with alcohol. But I feel like I can say with confidence that I probably would not have dealt with this issue if I had still been drinking, and it is for a number of reasons:

- I doubt I would have been able to afford it. My industry has been hit extremely hard by lockdowns over the last year, and I don't think I would have felt comfortable dropping half a grand on new orthotics. However, in the past 24 days, I have managed to save almost the exact amount of this expense because I have quit drinking (and smoking, which would never have been possible had I still been drinking).

- I would have felt a ton of anxiety about booking an appointment with any sort of medical professional if I were still drinking. I have hated going to any sort of doctor/specialist over the last 10 years unless it's an emergency because I knew that I was drinking way more than I should and I hated being asked the question of how much and how often I drank.

- I'm not sure I would have been realistic about the pain I was experiencing in my foot. Alcohol can numb pain, so I'd probably have gone home from work and drank until the aching in my feet was not that bad anymore. And the foot pain would probably pale in comparison to some of the intense hangovers I was experiencing. I'd still be damaging my feet and exposing myself to the long term risk of plantar faciitis, but I wouldn't be nearly as aware of the fact that something was wrong.

- The appointment was at 8:30 in the morning. No way in hell would I have been willing to get up for it if I was drinking at the time. I probably would have wanted later in the day, but that would have caused problems for me because I would probably have been working at that point in time. 

I think it's incredibly likely that I would have ended up experiencing significantly worse consequences had I been drinking when I started to notice this pain. And this is really just one example of how not drinking has helped me in other areas of my life.

Eliminating my alcohol consumption has not been easy, but I feel so much more capable of tackling issues that come up in my day to day life, and I'm incredibly thankful for that.

I thought (and still think): anything better than drinking. But I would like to snack less as well. Are there any tips how to deal with coping mechanisms that might not be healthy, but that keep you from drinking?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Wednesday, people! Depending on where you are, spring is coming. After I got sober, I´ve been so much more present in my life, and in my garden, with my wife and kids, - with everything, really. That´s a really good thing - and sometimes not so good.

What do you do when things are looking bleak? When it´s a very ordinary Wednesday and the weekend seems far away, the job is a drag and, well, whatever rubs you the wrong way is rubbing you the wrong way. Do you have or do a little something to brighten your day? Share your little Wednesday Sparkle^TM! Big or small, tiny as a star or big as the sun. (Which is in fact a star, you know? See what I did there?? Focus!)

I´m going to plant some tomatoes and cucumber for the greenhouse. It´s a month late, really, but I don´t care. It is NEVER to late to do a good thing.

I was angry that I had to quit. I knew my body was not taking it in stride in my late 30s the way it did in my early 20s...but damn it, it wasn't fair. 

I was angry at the people with big success stories. I was supposed to feel inspired by the mile markers in recovery, but I couldn't seem to make it past a few days while it seemed EVERYONE else could...it wasn't fair, what was wrong with ME?

I was angry at the people who always drank moderately.  I mean...what IS the point of one glass? How DO you drink a few times a year? I couldn't grasp the concept...and it wasn't fair. 

I was REALLY angry at the people who never drank. They said, ""I have never been interested in alcohol"" but I heard ""I am so much better than you"" and there was no way to react rationally.  It wasn't fair. 

I can now look back and see that going through life thinking it was all so unfair...was really the addiction finding any way it could to convince me to drink. I was a sucker for throwing pity parties with myself as the sole guest, free to drink without judgement. 

Thanks for reading this embarrassing confession.  

Fun Fact: I drank nearly every night and watched Star Trek 90% of the time. It was my comfort.  When I read that Wil Wheaton was sober...I stopped throwing my little fit and got sober too. (Okay that was slightly embarrassing confession too, but who cares)

I wanted to make a nice post but I’m usually exhausted after work to do anything other than shower and sleep. My anxiety kept me up throughout the night so I guess this is it.

Anyways it’s been two and a half months. Although I’m low key proud AF I can’t seem to be nicer to myself. 

Since my last post whenever that was, my step-dad died. I call him step dad but he was actually my uncle who helped raise me. He was the only male parental figure I had in my life really. He passed away last Friday. We hadn’t talked for years. The following day an old friend reached out to hang out, I told them I quit drinking but I’m not going to stop someone else. The individual came over with a bottle of apple crown royal to try, it smelt delicious although I hate crown royal. I was offered a drink or a “taste” multiple times but turned them down. I drank 6 big glasses of water while this guy sipped his drinks. I DD’d for him and made sure he was alright. I also realized I don’t like people and my sobriety has lowered my tolerance for shitty people. (This dude slammed a bag of ice on my floor to break it up - which honestly isn’t a big deal - except I live on a top floor of an apartment and I’m very mindful of being loud. When I was like “dude, neighbour’s man have a bit of respect” he basically just said “sucks to be them” kinda reply).

I’ve also survived smaller less intense possible drinking encounters. I’ve stayed away from birthday celebrations or any social events (there’s no covid where I’m living, I think we’re in level 2). The last shot or two left over from the crown royal was given to a friend who came over for a meal (everyone was commenting on how good it smelt and tasted). I even had an opportunity to have a few beer at a restaurant while waiting for my food but I happily declined. Oh and the beer that’s been in the fridge for the past 2 months? It’s still in the fridge. Sometimes I don’t notice it. Sometimes I do.

More importantly I’ve saved over $500 the past two months. For once I’m able to get all of mine and my wife’s monthly bills paid. I have no money to spare so I’m still struggling but not as bad as before.

I had to turn down a dream job yesterday due to not having my licence at the moment. I’m really hating myself even harder since then but nothing I can do except “focus on the things you can control”.. I’m still going in for the interview to explain my situation (my life’s a fucking mess guys lol).

Anyways it’s time for work. Have a great day guys. 
Know that someone somewhere is really fucking proud of your sobriety! Keep kickin ass my friends

It was all of a sudden so easy as I had no choice, I couldn’t drink any more even if I wanted to. For over a year, I led a life of blissful entrapment.

After 20 or so years of drinking, and at some times chronically drinking, thats me im done, i basically can't cope with the anxiety anymore, 

I've been to AA before that didn't work for me i just felt like a fraud, oh and i managed Antabuse before and did 9mths sober, but this is the first time in 20yrs and i'm seriously not actually finding it that hard at all to stop / cut right down, i just don't want to drink alcohol any more, when anything has gone wrong in my life its 100% always had alcohol involved in the situation, and by the grace of God since Christmas i've hardly drank, and i can now shave in the morning with out looking like i have been attacked by a Samurai sword. 

As a bit of one of last night i was looking forward to watching the football so i thought id have a couple of 4% lager cans, which i did, followed by one horrible nights sleep, bad dreams tossing and turning and a good splash of anxiety and depression to ice the cake with this morning, confirming what i already know ........ ""that's me and alcohol over"",

Anyway back to my rant, yes me and alcohol are over but i enjoy a cold beer when watching sport, so when i pop down to my local Shop / Supermarket etc does a Cold n/a beer cost the same, some times even more than your regular beer, why does a 4 pack of 0% beer cost near as dam it the same price as a big fat bottle of paint striping, white ,22.5 units of legalised euthanasia.

We all know alcohol cost is mainly tax, as a bottle of fermented shit basically costs nothing to make so why does the fermented shit that has zero of the (allegedly) pleasurable stuff in it not cost hardly anything, do are government charge a tax on 0% booze or is it the shops?

Why don't the government use the revenue it makes from alcohol sales to subsidise this life saving 0% alcohol, and you don't have to be Einstein to work out the money it could save from alcohol related hospitalisations, and the general cost us alcoholics cause (sorry if your not an alcoholic) to society.

Personally if i was the government i would make it a prescription item or give it away .... as it would save money in the long run but that's to easy.

Thank you, Rant over!!!

I don’t know why but I drank a few drinks a few days in a row. I didn’t get drunk. I had 3-4 each day over time. Like 4 drinks over a 6 hour period. With food ect. Still felt the effects which was crazy to notice the dehydration ect. I worked 18 days in a row before I drank and I think I burnt myself out. Haven’t had a drink in 24 hours. Feel better. No anxiety this time stopping. Probably because I didn’t let it get too bad. Anyhow, life without even a few drinks is so much better.  Today I decided to reschedule all my work meetings and do some self care. (18 days in a row of work was damaging to my headspace) I need time to decompress so I don’t drink. So today I took a bubble bath, did a hair mask, took lots of sober naps, drank tons of water... had an amazing green smoothie I make at home... took vitamins, probiotics and put my damn phone on silent all day. I let myself just be present and relax. I’m realizing I have to treat myself to these days a few times a month to stay sober. We all are learning.

I don't even consider it ""being sober"" as I think that has a stigma attached to it when you tell people.

I was/am a passionate craft beer guy, and frugal. I would frequently pre-party at home to save on buying drinks out. I am a guy who still loves the taste of beer and I am a long-time homebrewer. I do drink non-alcoholic beer and my own hop water.

Although I never considered myself a problematic drinker or alcoholic, I like to be the best at things, and for a time I was the best at drinking.

When I began my break I never imaging going through a day not thinking about alcohol. My self talk was always popping up in the back of my mind like a devil on my shoulder: ""You had a great day today, you should celebrate with a cocktail""

There was always an excuse to drink, and oddly enough you need to provide one to friends when you DON'T drink. In my whole drinking career I think the longest I had gone before was maybe only a month. 3 craft beers (7%+ ABV) a day was quite common. I am self-employed so the luxury of having a few lunch beers was always a distraction from my work.

What I have noticed in the time I took off from drinking is my motivation to better myself in other areas of my life has increased. In the last few months I received a college grant to pursue a hobby/passion I picked up during the pandemic to turn it into a career direction change. I had to prune some ""friends"" out of my life who I realized were just drinking buddies and gave me an excuse to normalize high consumption and sustain destructive habits.

The biggest advice is to champion your wins. People are so quick to beat themselves up and get down on themselves for failures. Set your goals and take it day by day. One day is a win. Celebrate it. It takes time to rewire your brain. Alcohol is like a cheat code for your mind's reward system. It shows you are capable of attaining those levels of pleasure/happiness -- find other natural and healthy ways to do it! Go for a hike, meet new people (safely), take in a sunrise/sunset, travel, read a book you had always been putting off, etc.

Also surround yourself with dependable people who will be a good influence on you, or keep you accountable if you need that level of support. Someone you can call and talk to when you are feeling down.

EDIT: Just wanted to add one last thing -- people make the prejudgement that sobriety is boring, scary, unfun, etc. I feel like I've been fooled to think I needed to have a beer every time I went to a social engagement, had brunch, watched a movie, etc. Alcohol tricked me into thinking I needed to have booze to be funny or feel relaxed. I'm a rational guy and I put every preconceived notion I had to the test and found them all to be untrue for me. I now know I am more confident being 100% myself and in control of any situation. The hardest part is dealing with challenges/stresses, but I'd rather just deal with them head-on than to ignore them for another day.",29,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.58145916}"

On average 40-50 drinks a week the last 3 years. Sometimes a day off if I’m really tired, but I haven’t gone more than 3 days without drinking in the last 3 years. I’ve been wanting to quit for a while, but never took it seriously or the cravings got the best of me. I have been getting increasingly fed up with the control that alcohol has over me and I finally decided to put all the effort I have into quitting 2 days ago. Last drink I had was 2 nights ago on Easter, about 9 beers. Got phenibut to help keep me level (I’m aware of how addicting phenibut is). Was going to quit nicotine too but I quickly realized that quitting both alcohol and nicotine at the same time was overwhelming. I’m in college, I lift heavy 5 days a week, and take loads of vitamin/mineral supplements.

I was fine yesterday other than a little restless. Got about 6 hours of sleep last night. Today I feel very restless, very anxious, slightly delusional and confused almost like the feeling you get when you’ve stayed up for over 24 hours, racing thoughts, no appetite. No nausea, constant fidgeting, constant pacing. I’m still “mentally coherent” so to say so no signs of DT’s. No hallucinations. But I’m laying in bed so restless and anxious that it feels like I want to jump out of my own skin. Like I feel like I could run a mile or have to run a mile to calm down. Minor shakes but I attribute that to caffeine intake a few hours ago. My cravings are so strong as this point that I’m constantly thinking of getting beer or whiskey to calm myself down. They have gotten so bad that they convinced me that I didn’t want to live life or life wasn’t worth living without alcohol to make me happy 

My question is, is it common to experience withdrawals 2 days after quitting drinking? I thought that the withdrawals happen immediately. I am a hypochondriac so I want to make sure I’m not giving myself placebo withdrawals by overthinking the entire thing because I’m an anxious person by nature. I was convinced because I’m not drinking a bottle a day or a case of beer a day, I wouldn’t experience withdrawals. Guess I was wrong.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.513103}"

From my partner, my family, my coworkers, my friends... and when I stopped drinking, while everyone was super congratulatory and positive, I’m starting to realize that nobody realized how bad it really was. 

I just planned my first post COVID vacation (thank you vaccine!) and a friend texted asking if I was still not drinking. I told her yes, and then confided in my partner how anxious I was feeling about our first big vacation together where I’ll have to turn down many drinks. He said he thought I could probably have a few if I wanted, and it stopped me cold in my tracks. 

I completely broke down and told him that while I might have been functional, I was definitely an alcoholic. I hid how much I drank from him. I drank alone. I blacked out frequently. I pregamed way more than anyone knew. I woke up hungover almost every day. I googled symptoms about withdrawal and I tried to stop so many fucking times and I couldn’t. I told him all of this and started sobbing. He was stunned. 

It made me realize how much of a barrier I’ve put up, maybe even to myself, about my drinking. Because for so long, I didn’t want to admit that it had gotten that bad or that I had the problem my parents always feared I would (I grew up with a lot of family history of severe alcoholism). It also made me feel so alone, because I feel like people who aren’t addicts don’t understand that we think about drinking every single day, that sometimes we count minutes to stay sober, and that we can feel like having a panic attack about a theoretical drink offer on a vacation far, far away. 

I’ve been alcohol free for 1 year and 4 months now. I feel simultaneously, perversely proud and sick to my stomach at how well I hid my disease. I feel angry that nobody could tell, and that they don’t think I ever struggled. I feel grateful for my sobriety and this community.

As I look in the mirror, I feel self conscious about my appearance. I look tired and aged. I kind of feel this way too. I often wonder how much of an impact drinking has had on the aging of my body, as I am still pretty young (23) with alcohol abuse having been in full swing for over four years with no breaks. I also know that I always looked tired before anyway. Being insecure isn't uncommon for anyone, but its something to work on! 

Anyway. Despite me giving up drinking, I was unable to fix the damage it had caused to one of my college classes. I definitely tried my best to study and spent a decent amount of time doing so but there were quite a few days spent being too hungover to do the homework that I needed to in order to succeed. In a class that is VERY foundational to my success down the road. I had to decide to either try and catch up in my other classes or to try and barely pass all of them or accept that I messed up.  SO I guess I'll be taking a class in the summer to master this subject. I am feeling sick to my stomach about the whole thing because I could've done better, but I am trying now and that's definitely worth something. This is definitely not the first time I am looking at my failed progress in college as the result my addiction.

I hope I can get my degree and look back at the best decision I've ever made in my life, which is staying sober. If you're thinking about getting sober, please do yourself a huge favor and make the change. It's hard and it took me a few weeks to process the idea of being sober with having alcoholic roommates, but I promise you, this community will be one of your lifelines and you are capable.

My drinking on shift has consistently crossed the line. I started my sobriety on April 1 and my two sober coworkers have been very supportive, but my boss hasn’t seemed to take notice. That changed last night when he saw me take a shot of lemonade with some of my favorite customers who had just gotten engaged. He casually mentioned “you on the wagon?” I told him at least for the month of April, yes, and then I’ll reassess things. He nodded and said “sometimes it’s good to take a while to work on yourself.” The subject never came up again the rest of the evening, but after that moment the dynamic between us completely changed and we got along better than we have in the two years I’ve worked there.

Being down the road a ways I'm trying to remember all the things that helped me the most in the first month or so. There's so much and I don't want to overwhelm my friend. I just thought it could be cool to get a running list of the greatest hits that helped YOU in the beginning or what's helping you now if you're starting out. 

Also, what support did you get from friends that helped you the most? I want to make sure I'm being a good friend to them now that it's their turn to go sober. 

Here are a two of the things that I remember helping me the most. What's missing on the list? 

1. Treat yourself like you have the flu for the first week or two. You don't shame yourself for sleeping too much or looking like hot garbage when you have the flu. Eat the snacks, sleep the sleep. No shame. 

2. Write out the reasons you're getting sober now while it's hard. You may need to read that later when you're wondering if you can try drinking again. 

3. While you need to find a support system you don't have to tell anyone you aren't ready to tell, even if that's never. There's no time limit for sharing your personal business.

Having a couple of glasses a wine a week, my new approach to moderation didn't seem like an issue and I thought everything was under control. I drank three strong beers yesterday and for the first time in four months, I woke up in a hot sweaty mess with that familiar sense of fogginess and intangible dread. My heart was racing on and off all morning, I snapped at my coworkers in a meeting, and have just felt scared and fearful over nothing in particular all day.

I can't tell whether the anxious feeling is so strong because my alcohol tolerance is much lower, or whether this was actually the state I was perpetually in when I used to drink most days. I'm leaning towards the latter. I think I took my new normal-- being able to cope with my emotions, not feeling great highs, but never feeling bad lows-- completely for granted.

It became a problem very quickly to the point I was drinking every evening, making constant reckless decisions, doing poorly at university, and driving up debt.

And sooo many social events in my age group (even virtually during the pandemic!) are centered around alcohol.

I spent the weekend outside as much as possible, cooking at night, watching movies with my boyfriend.  It really helped being busy and just enjoying the little things in life.  Didn't think about the past or the future, just thought about the now.  About the birds chirping, the smell of spring...getting excited about the food I was about to eat.

I watched an interesting video which talked about the origins of the word Alcohol -  derived from the Arabic word Al-Kuhl, meaning: Body-Eating Spirit.  The idea is that there are spirits looking for people that are opening their bodies and souls to them, and alcohol is the catalyst for that opening.  We literally allow something else to control us, but we still have to take responsibility for this spirit's actions.  This helped put my alcohol use in perspective.  The willingness I had to let these demons in, take over my body, my actions...my life.  They don't want the best for me, they don't have the same goals as me...they want quite the opposite.  

Anyways, I am happy to be out of last week's slum.  I am taking notes on what helped me get out of it.  I know more are to follow, but at least I am building experience on how to deal with these lows.  My old method is tried and tested (any slums are welcomed and dulled down with a few beers), but this method is new.  Lots to learn, and plenty of time to do so.

The past three years have been amazing and I've dealt with all of my issues head on. I resolved my trauma. I no longer struggle from any mental health issues. I have a great job and a dog! I eat really well and exercise regularly. I turned to christianity which isn't for everyone but has helped me immensely.  I would consider myself a completely different person. I've also smoked weed on occasion but without even thinking about it am able to moderate to maybe 2-4 times a month.

Wanted to check in this morning; I have the day off from work and I took a drive because it’s a beautiful day. I just happen to live in an area that is full of wineries and breweries, and my drive took me past several of them. Even just driving by, I found myself triggered in my thoughts about maybe eventually enjoying a cider at the ciderhouse or doing a wine tasting at one of the wineries in the summer. I know this is normal in new sobriety, but I wanted to post about it because it was really bothersome to me.

I am on my 9th day of sobriety, again, after being sober for 7.5 years and going out for 3. The first time I got sober I had hit a serious bottom, and for a really long time, I had no desire to drink. This time around, I could see myself starting to drink more and more and it started to scare me a bit, so I stopped. Nothing spectacular or terrible happened. I was just scared, and tired of the work it takes to be an alcoholic. But I’m finding that it’s harder to not return to alcoholic thinking this time around, thinking it would be okay eventually to have “just one.” I know it isn’t true. But my mind keeps going there, maybe because this time around “I wasn’t that bad.”

New job with better pay and upside, physical fitness is better than I could have imagined, most of my relationships are better, etc. 

I've been struggling a bit the last couple of weeks, though. My drinking played a role in the loss of my last relationship and that was really the catalyst for my quitting While I've tried to rekindle that relationship, my previous partner can't trust me and isn't willing to give us another shot. It's heartbreaking and has really been weighing on me despite my having started dating again, met a few really great women, and feeling more confident in who I am than I can remember. 

There's still a little hope in me that we'll come back together at some point down the road, but I'm struggling to accept that it's over, which is what I really need to do. And, as I'm sure many of y'all can relate, processing emotions while sober is a challenge when you've spent so long numbing them with alcohol. Sometimes I want to crawl out of my skin, disappear, get out of my head, make it all stop. But that's what the old me did and that's ultimately what led to the disintegration of my relationship. So I'll keep putting one foot in front of the other and walking the past of my best self.

The last time I went I was forced by child services, I was ready to lose my family because I just wanted to drink. About 4 years ago I started drinking again sometimes.  My husband and kids and I went on vacation and we decided that it would be ok to drink sometimes.  Rules were I could only drink on vacation, social gathering, and with my husband.  First clue that you shouldn't drink again is if there are rules.  So the past 4 years haven't been to bad.  To bad meaning I have only been caught drinking more than I should a few times. I believe the most days that I have had sober was 14 days, in 4 years. If I knew that I was going to be ""allowed to drink"" for something I would go get a bottle of vodka to hide so I could drink when I went to the bathroom.  It looks like I only had 3 drinks, but obviously much more.  The last 2 months it has been getting worse and worse.  My friend came over and what was supposed to be 2 drinks ended with a 6 pack, 2 bottles of wine, half a pint vodka, and fireball shots...for me.  I had no hangover and actually went jogging in the morning...that is an indication of how much I have been drinking.  The next morning my husband says ""Drank more than you said you were going to....you can't do this anymore""  and I agreed.  This was Friday.  I made it to Sunday...a whole day with no drinking and I went out to get half a pint...because that itch was so bad.  You all know that itch...that clawing in your gut that you want a drink.  That turned into me going out again to get more drinks.  My husband had no clue I had anything, but I know if I continue down this road I will lose everything.  So here I am 36 hours sober.  Knowing I really can not drink ever again....and it terrifies me.  I had a DUI years ago with my .45 blood alcohol level.  So I know what will happen...i have been down this road.

I had been downing 1-2 bottles of wine per night for about two years- starting at the end of college and into my first job- when COVID hit. At my job I was constantly calling out sick, missing deadlines, sneaking alcohol into work (because otherwise I couldn't keep my hands still), and a bunch of other stuff I still have nightmares about out of shame. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), I got laid off at the beginning of COVID like many others, and was left to my own devices day to day. I went from 1-2 bottles at night to being drunk 24/7, while having increasingly TERRIBLE anxiety attacks, acid reflux, personal relationships, etc.. Eventually, I had enough and got admitted to the hospital to detox. Best decision of my life.

Fast forward to today, and I am about to begin the 3rd full day of my new job, with a completely new relationship to alcohol (with help of my doctor and therapist). Sure, I can get bored, but it's a completely different experience. Just knowing I'm not a slave to my next drink has me actually excited about this new opportunity. I can wake up, put on makeup, choose a fun outfit that makes me feel good, and I feel like I am putting my best professional foot forward. There were too many days that I came in with dirty, stringy hair (""I'm trying to shampoo less! I use dry shampoo because I'm trying to help my hair!"" ---no actually girl, you just haven't showered all week because you're too drunk by the time you fall asleep and too hungover by the time you wake up), and I just wasn't putting my best foot forward by any means. Just thought I would write here, because I am sure some of you have had a similar experience. Thank you for reading!

2021-04-06 08:01:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mla0e2/gross/,Gross,"This past week has been one for the birds: 

A near HR incident with a little shit of a colleague that I had to train.

A pandemic wedding and quite frankly shameful event spent in the company of my dead eyed siblings as I assembly-line poured glass after glass of champagne for the guests in my gloves and mask.

I am overwhelmed with the feeling of wanting to bathe in bleach afterwards. 

Drove 26 hrs to visit my very much missed newly vaccinated father - he got the last shot end of February and said i could finally come see him, since Ive got my shot now too.

So I needed and intended on a weekend trip to visit to my dad who I have not seen in nearly two years for some peace afterwards. He is the only thing in the whole world that is steadfast and makes sense to me - - I love being around him - which some people find weird as he has Aspergers and can’t hear me when I speak about 80% of the time even with his hearing aids.

During this time, where I actually managed to unclench, my insidious ex contacted me multiple times in an attempt to impart his particular vicious and truly cruel humor on me.

I accidentally bodydiamorphia-shamed my stepmom, snarky as usual, on a rant about body dysmorphia - guess the stress of the week and a couple years of not seeing her made me forget that she herself is also anorexic/Bulimic. She force fed me omelets and toast when I wasn’t hungry, made a big production about how much toast she planned to eat with her omelets, when I realized what I had done.

(I’m having a sorry / not sorry moment on that one.)

Add to that the constant barrage of drama that flows from my best friend, Matt, who’s stress I absorb like a sponge.

Apparently, even 470 of continuous sobriety or whatever does not mean I know how to be around my dysfunctional family any more than I know how to be around them wasted.

What I can say is that while I teared up when I left my dad’s house - I hate leaving him - it wasn’t the earth shattering pain I normally feel when I leave him - where I have to pull over half a block away and sob for an hour.

Had night terrors that woke me - I slept like shit, quite frankly and I am drained.

This IS progress.
I am still chugging away at life and sobriety.
though i suppose this crazy rant may not be inspirational or a testament to that fact.

It's only one night, but I want to nip it in the bud rather than spiralling, so I guess I'm kinda posting here for accountability. I completely went for it on Saturday night, horrible mixture of beer and red wine. Once I start like that I can't stop, so I gave myself horrendous 2 days worth of alcohol poisoning - not really the restful Easter weekend I was hoping for! Think this has to be it now, no more trying to moderate, just complete sobriety. I've reset my sober counter, feel sad that I'm back on 2 days again, but it's a start.

One of these ways has been via groups online such as this one.

Another was to try a couple of the well known addiction organisations.  The problem I have with these is that I am, at heart, an introvert and I don't really like group situations.

I tried an online AA meeting - and that was okay - primarily as it was online and I didn't have to talk to anyone.  But AA has a quite rigid structure to their offering and they talk quite a lot about ""God"" or ""Higher Powers"" etc, which doesn't sit well with me.

Tonight I jumped into an online SMART meeting - and I didn't really like that one either.  They don't have the religious overtones, but they make you talk every visit.  And while I can find something to say, I feel as though I would just end up saying what I think they want to hear just because I really didn't want to say anything.

My wife has put up with my alcoholic behaviour for quite a while now and I don't want to put her through any more.  However she is quite adamant about me getting ""help"" from one of these well known organisations.

I guess I am just at a bit of a loss as to what my path through this will be.

I am a 39 year old single father raising my kids 100% on my own (17 and 11).

My parents have a lot of money (millions).  And when I'm honest with myself I realize that they have been enabling my drinking and drug use all these years.  We live in a different state from them now for the past 4 years.  But if I fuck up (ex spend all the money on alcohol and quit my job), all I have to do is make up some story about how we need money and bam- they wire it.  Daughter needs shoes?  $300.  Have to pay the rent? $800.  They know I am spending a lot of it on drugs and alcohol, and they have for many years (I used to steal all their percocets and ritalins so).  So they will send me money knowing that I will buy alcohol and drugs literally WHENEVER I want.  But strangely, they are not interested in getting me any help.  There's been a few times over the years, most recently in December when I broke down to them. I opened up and was honest about how much I was drinking and asked them to please help me go to rehab and watch my kids.  And it's almost like they don't believe me.  My dad accused me of just wanting a ""break"".  Which is very insulting because I've been raising these kids all by myself for 8 years with no assistance or child support from the mother (we don't even know where she is).  But they tell me I have to figure it out on my own.  Then they invariably call DCFS and tell them everything I said (which is strange because they seem to not believe it), and I have to deal with the anxiety of that.  Then my children and I get really mad at them and stop talking to them for a while.  But all I have to do is send an email and say the car broke down- whatever- and they will invariably wire me hundreds of dollars just like that.  They also claim at times that they can't afford to send me to rehab, yet 2 years ago when our car took a shit they wired $27,000 for a brand new car- just like that.  I know this relationship is toxic, but I have no one else!  My parents moved far away from my family and isolated us from everyone.  I don't even know my mother's maiden name or where she was born.  I knew of 2 of my cousins, 1 died from cirrhosis 2 years ago at the age of 41.

Sobriety has been a none event in that I don't see how any part of my life has been diminished by staying sober. Friends and family didn't abandon me. The liquor store didn't close down.

I started drinking when I was 14. While attending university, I became friends with a huge group of people that partied all the time. The first house I lived in outside of the dorms was next to a house full of dudes who drank pbr like it was water, sold and used all sorts of drugs, and threw parties every weekend. My roommates and I drank with them all the time but it was never to the point where it was affecting my life. Then we moved to a new house. The parties continued, and we became friends with our upstairs neighbors who drank wine all the time. One of them also had constant access to coke. I’d smoked weed and tried adderall but, man, coke became my new favorite thing. I dropped out of college after getting pregnant from a one-night stand after a party. I started drinking more to cope with my depression about the situation. Then I got my first job at a bar, where I started drinking and doing cocaine with real adults instead of all of my college friends. I worked at more bars over the years and drank every night the second I clocked out. I became friends with more and more people who had access to coke, and eventually started selling it myself, along with molly and whatever other drugs my friends had. Eventually I worked at a sports bar that was next door to a 21+ movie theatre, and all of our employees were friends with the employees next door. We would all take turns during our shifts going next door to get a shot, then one of them would come get a shot from us, and so on and so forth, every single day, no matter which shift. After my shift I’d slam beer after beer with my coworkers and then end up doing tons of shots, and then by the end of the night we were in the movie theatre doing lines off the bartop. 

I was dating a guy at this time who also drank and did coke all day every day. I thought we were a match made in heaven. But it started getting to the point where I was blacking out every night and becoming the world’s meanest drunk. Or getting so sloppy drunk that I’d throw up wherever I was and he’d have to deal with me (once was all over his computer and keyboard, I can’t believe he stayed with me after that lol). We were already starting to have issues when one day I decided to stop at a bar around 1pm to have a beer and play some pinball before my shift that night. I ended up getting roofied by the only other person in that bar and remember nothing from the rest of the day. I woke up in my boyfriend’s bed the next morning to him completely pissed and done with me. Apparently I’d driven myself from that bar to his workplace, caused a scene there, somehow made it to my house to change for work, and then went to work and tried to shove my tongue down the bartenders throat while also telling all of my customers I was hammered drunk. Then I drove to my boyfriend’s house, climbed into his bed, and slept for 12 hours.

Needless to say, he broke up with me. I once again fell into a huge depression, and then I had to move out of my house suddenly (unrelated reasons), so I was couch-hopping with 2 cats. My drinking and coke problems started to effect me financially, so I finally decided it was time to move back to my home state and live with my parents. I was so defeated by this point that I stopped drinking, stopped eating, stopped caring about anything, and became extremely suicidal. My grandma basically had to monitor me 24-7 to make sure I wouldn’t harm myself. A few months went by, I got a job, I felt better, I started drinking again... and then I got a DUI and totaled my car. So I had to move from my hometown to the town 30 minutes away my mom is in so she could drive me to and from work every day. Months went by and I was fine again. I had made friends, I was able to drink just a few beers and go home and go to bed and still make it to work the next morning. But then - yet again - I started drinking heavily and becoming an absolute asshole every time I blacked out (which was a lot). 

Around this time I started working at a bar again. I once again found a group of people that loved to drink and do cocaine as much as I did. I got back into drinking every night after my shift and once the bar was closed, we’d all be pulling out our baggies. Then I started drinking during work again. Everyone did it so I never considered it a problem... until I decided one day to slam several shots of fireball at 10am while opening the bar. I was trashed by the time the bar opened and ended up walking out during the lunch rush because I could barely function. 

While working at this bar I met my fiancé. He’d just turned 21 (I was 27 at this time) so he looooved drinking and doing drugs. We fell for each other immediately. The first several months of our relationship consisted of getting hammered and doing drugs, and everything seemed great. Until I started getting really mean every single night. Every morning I woke up and heard about the horrible things I’d said to him, I couldn’t believe it. Yet it never stopped me from doing the exact same thing the next time I drank. After about 8 months, he got drunk with his friends and texted me that he was done with my shit. We ended up getting back together a few months later, and then moving into our first house together. It was apparent that I had a drinking problem, and I told him over and over again that I was going to stop. But those attempts never lasted more than a week at a time. It turns out it’s really hard to be sober when your partner constantly drinks too. He also made the comment several times that it was something I needed to do on my own, and that only I could fix myself. He didn’t believe me when I told him I would need his support. 

Anyway. A year went by. We got 4 kittens and made our house into a home, and we became a family. We still drank and smoked weed. I said I’d quit drinking every time I woke up and discovered I’d been an asshole again. It’d last for a few days before I’d start sneaking shots, hiding my stashes, and lying about being drunk.

Two weeks ago we celebrated our 2 year anniversary and the one year anniversary of getting our house. The next day was going great, we’d both had good days at work, I’d bought a ton of groceries and stuff we needed for the house, life was good. Then he went to the bar and I decided to go get a half pint of vodka. That half pint turned into 2 more. By the time I finished the 3rd one it was just after 8:30pm. I ended up throwing up all over the rug in front of the couch. I called him because we tell each other everything and I thought maybe he’d come home and help me with the rug. Instead it turned into a huge fight because I was once again hiding my drinking and lying about it. He refused to come home. He said he was done. After hours of me relentlessly texting and calling and bothering him, he finally came home after the bar closed, but he wanted nothing to do with me. That next morning I cried and told him I was going to stop, I meant it, he had to give me one more chance, etc etc. But he’d given me so many chances over the last year to get my shit together and I’d finally pushed him over the edge. He left and didn’t come back home that night. The next day I went to work and when I came home, all of his clothes were gone. He didn’t talk to me for days and when he finally did, I asked if we were 100% done, because I needed to know what to do about the house. He said yes, and I spent the next several hours moving our entire house and our four cats into my parents’ spare bedroom. 

I’ve been incredibly depressed, anxious, suicidal. I’ve lost over 15 pounds because I can’t eat, and I can only sleep 2-3 hours per night. I made it 10 days without drinking. But because I was in a manic state, I decided to break that sobriety on Friday night. I’ve been hearing rumors ever since we broke up that he’s been cheating on me for months, and that one girl has an STD that doesn’t go away. So I’ve felt even more hurt and betrayed. During my drunken spree I confronted him about it, I confronted her, I ruined a friendship with a mutual friend by digging for information. I called another friend and left her a crying voicemail that I was going to kill myself. I texted my boyfriend’s mom telling her that her son has been cheating on me, and then asked if she wanted to have lunch with me? By the time I came down from my high, I felt so low and ashamed. He refuses to talk to me, and understandably so, because yet again I wasn’t able to stay sober. 

Today will be my last 3rd day of sobriety. I’ve got to make a change. I’ve lost the person I care about most in this world, and if I’m not careful I’m going to end up losing myself. I would love any advice or support. I’ve lurked on here for a few years now, I know my story isn’t far from others, so any help would be appreciated.

It was not epic, it did not result in stupid drunk texts, a fight with my husband, a DUI, a parenting fail. Nothing amazing or terrible happened. It was quite boring, actually.

I had 2 large glasses of Riesling bc it was warm and sunny. Dumb, I know. I basically binge ate snacks and scrolled on my phone while watching TV for 3 hours. Then I went to bed.

And now it’s 4am and I’ve been awake, thirsty af and unable to sleep for almost 2 hours. My legs feel hot and I’m tossing and turning. I just know I’m gonna feel tired and shitty when I wake up and I need to take care of my little guys all day. Fuck. I’ll be ok, though. 

I’m not down on myself but I can’t believe I did what I did tonight every single night for YEARS. It was an autopilot thing and I never questioned it. So many nights of shitty sleep followed by tired, half assed days. So many boring nights on my couch. So many calories from mediocre beer/wine and mediocre food that I’d eat mindlessly.

If you’re reading this and considering breaking that cycle of daily drinking, my god, it is so worth it. Sober life is the shit. Sober sleep, sober mornings, sober parenting, sober TV watching (I missed an entire super important scene bc I was distracted), sober music, sober self care, sober reading... it’s all just great.

But last night as I went to grocery store (which is right next to liquor store) the thought of having a drink crossed my mind. 

It set up perfectly, wife and I both off for the weekend and all chores done, nothing left to do, except enjoy a nice dinner at home. 

Somewhere deep inside me spoke, it said something like this; “go ahead Willy, just pick up a bottle of wine and maybe a pony of vodka. It would be so nice to have a drink/s. 

I almost listened to this voice, it almost made sense, I could almost taste it. I thought about it for a second and that’s all it took to realize what a terrible and stupid idea it was, if not reckless and dangerous. Because we all know in sobriety, you are just one drink away from the ditch, so cooler heads prevailed and I walked on by. 

I guess as strong as I am in my resolve and continued sobriety, Alcoholism and the monster are strong and  still there, doing push-ups in the parking lot, waiting for their  chance to take me on. 

I guess that voice will always be in their somewhere, for ever. I just have to remain vigilant, to know when it is speaking to me and to shut it down immediately, it’s just not worth the inevitable abyss that would follow that first drink. I may not be able to control an endless night of drinking, but I can control the first drink and that’s all I need to do. 

Not really a close call, but it’s interesting that the thought appeared in my mind, from seemingly nowhere

A few years ago I (24F) was in an emotionally abusive relationship with someone who’s father committed suicide. He ended up coping by drinking a lot and I was there with him. We ended up breaking up for good reasons yet I find I now have a dependency on alcohol. 

I’ve met and been with an amazing person for over two years and recently i’ve realized my anxiety about the fact I have a dependency on alcohol is making me feel like I am incapable of amounting to anything I used to be able to do. I was once so driven and looked at as the “together” one. 

A few weeks ago my dear roommate who I have known and lived with since freshman year of college (we graduated in 2019) said I can make her feel exhausted, especially when I’m
drinking. My boyfriend who I love so much once said I can be a lot when I’m drunk. These are the first two instances it’s been blatantly pointed out though in my mind I knew. 

I’m proud of myself because two weeks ago I went three days without drinking. Last week two. And this week (I drank today on a monday) one day if you include sunday. It’s not a lot, but it’s a lot more than I’ve been doing. 

I feel so mortified. Especially after my roommate said i can be exhausting in conversation. I guess that may be an insecurity too, but I still realize the drinking has contributed. 

I want to be able to stop for two weeks. I don’t want to stop forever but I’m scared I can’t do the whole moderation thing. I knew I was having a slight issue before the pandemic, but since this has started (I’m in NYC) I’ve realized i’ve been irresponsible with my beer or wine or gin nights and now have much more of a dependency than I thought would be possible bc I thought I was in control. 

I appreciate so much my roommate pointed it out. And I NEVER want to mess things up with my partner bc he really is so patient and uplifting. I just feel like I lost myself. I dont know what my interests are anymore (part of this comes from quarantine depression) bc I focus so much on how bad I feel about this issue. 

Going one, two, or three days is a huge step for me and I still feel uncomfortable to talk about with people who know me personally. I would love tips, advice, support anything to not feel alone when perhaps I deserve it. I can’t believe how I’ve lost myself. I keep thinking once things reopen I’ll be in control but to be real I was starting to think I had a bad relationship with alcohol before this. Now it just took off and I really want to make it to two weeks.

I was already drinking too much (a lot) when the pandemic hit. I tried several times to calm things down but it always ramped up. I thought I’d smarten up after my wife found the receipt for several bottles of liquor I’d purchased and hidden in my office and then when I lied my way out of that, she found the bottles. It was embarrassing more than anything - we got through it, I stopped drinking for about a week but then it started again. 

Fast forward and the lesson I learned? Take money out from an ATM for purchasing the liquor and then hide the bottles better.

With Working From Home, most days I’d start drinking around 2-3pm. I didn’t think anyone could tell. Last Friday, my wife found an empty bottle of vodka that I’d stashed too quickly on the way to hide it fully in our recycling. She confronted me, we talked again, but she doesn’t know about the other empty bottles she didn’t find.

I say High Functioning as I’m still doing well at work - high commendations from co-workers and in line for a promotion yet... I know I’ve been in meetings where I’ve started slurring my words or turning off the camera so I could pour another drink (into a coffee mug - no one would be the wiser!).

I’m committing to it now, though - I still haven’t figured out everything I need to do but I’m starting with a hard cut off from alcohol. I started Saturday morning and plan to keep going indefinitely.

While not easy, the first few days were relatively easy. I managed to fight temptations and am enjoying the head clear feeling in the morning. I’m making a list of hobbies I either want to get into or start to take more seriously.

This evening was tough. I know one of my triggers has been dealing with a daughter with a severe anxiety disorder and depression. She had an episode tonight and I managed to keep myself from pouring that first drink “just to take the edge off”.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Tuesday, friends! Many apologies for dropping the ball yesterday (I was sidelined by an awful migraine), and many thanks to Saint Homer for stepping in. 

I’m going to build off my little experience for today’s post. We all have times where things don’t work out as we want, or expect, or desire. What do **YOU** do to cope when that happens? Just to say it, this could be small stuff like “I stepped in a puddle and now my socks are wet” or things like “I lost my job/am getting divorced/lost my housing.”  All of these are valid, in my opinion, because dealing with the little setbacks helps us build the mental muscles to cope with the big ones. 

For myself, I had a really stressful and uncomfortable weekend with family ... which led directly to developing a migraine and missing posting the DCI like I had committed to. I was really disappointed in myself and felt I had really let the SD community down. So, when I woke up, I figured I had a few options:
1) hang my head in shame, delete my account, and never been seen here again
2) accept that I was not physically able to accomplish something I wanted to do
3) be extremely thankful to Saint Homer for being so gracious toward me and posting the DCI this morning
4) calling several friends and talking through my frustrations today, in an effort to remove the emotional logjam in my brain
5) scheduling an appointment with my therapist tomorrow
6) responding to a lot of lovely comments here, which was wonderfully uplifting. 
7) I suppose I could have gone and decided to drink, but that didn’t cross my mind since it didn’t seem to be much of a “solution” LOL

For what it’s worth, I chose numbers 2-6. Number 1 seemed a bit melodramatic and unnecessary and Number 7 was clearly not going to solve anything. 

So ... what are YOUR coping mechanisms when things don’t go as planned? Big things or little things ... they all help us get through the next stressor. I’m extremely interested in what you all have to say, and sharing what’s in our respective toolboxes to help each other through life’s inevitable bumps. 😊

Also found one of my triggers - feeling defeated about not being able to run made me want to say fuck it and open a bottle of wine. 

I didn’t. 

I guess it’s good I was sober when it happened. Renovating an old house and the room was dark so I didn’t see that somebody left an upturned floorboard nail-side out. So at least I don’t feel like I caused this by being a dumb drunk lady but dammit this is bad timing.

I'm still in medieval England in my reading life. I'm up to Henry VI-- one of the boring, nice-guy Henries, haha. Still an interesting time.

Movie I watched this week that real hit me hard was *Nomadland*. I don't think this is a movie that can be spoiled per se so I'm not using the spoiler tag or anything. 

It's slow but beautiful. Francis McDormand is great as usual. I'm in Northern Nevada myself right now and I was during the recession when this was set, too, so it really hit home. And my partner and I have even contemplated a nomad lifestyle for various reasons of our own (one of which is certainly lack of money like the protagonist, though we aren't in such dire straights as she was. Yet.) But it was very uplifting in spite of the bleak subject matter. And all the people she meets-- wow! I wondered if they were even actors because they seemed so real. And all the scenery and all the nice people reminded me how much I love America even though as a nation we are often troubled. And the way the movie talked about death and grief was very real and very relatable too. I cried a lot through this movie. 

That's it for me this week. :)

It's kinda funny. I bought a bottle of rosé on January 15th. It fell out the bottom of my paper bag and smashed all over the kitchen floor. I took it as a sign and did 40 days of sobriety. Broke it with a lunch cocktail, which was less enjoyable than I hoped, and got back on the wagon myself for another 23 days. Then found a nice white wine on sale at Trader Joe's and thought how much I'd like to have it with brie on their fig and olive crackers. I did and it was lovely. Then I had a truly silly evening with a fwb and accidentally left his (prefab mango margarita, ugh) and my (Jameson) bottles on the table for my roommate to see. Embarrassing. So back on the ol wagon until yesterday, cause it was Easter. So I bought the same brand of rosé I dropped back in January. And you know what? It. Was. Awful. Too sweet. Sickly. Highly regrettable. 

So I'm back on. And weirdly, I feel almost psychically tied to my brother. I doubt my solidarity sobriety does him any good at all. He's spent the last month with our family sober and happy. He flew home 4/2 and dove immediately back into his toxic, mutually abusive, enabling relationship with his alcoholic partner and landed straight back in the ER about the time I was grimacing at a teacup full of sweet wine.

I know they aren't actually related. I know my sobriety is only for me and his... his... HIS is not in my control at all, even though I wish to God I could stop for both of us. Because I can.

Having a hard time watching my family members continue to abuse alcohol and come up with excuses for their behavior.,"I think about alcohol constantly. It’s hard not to when it’s all over tv, billboards, radio commercials and especially when it’s your family. My immediate family has a rough relationship with alcohol. My parents are divorced but strengthened their bond with alcohol. My older brother has been to rehab once and was sober for over 2 years before. He has been going on benders on and off for the last two years after we moved in together. At the time I was heavily drinking and didn’t care that my actions were influencing my brothers’. He also picked up a coke habit in the last few months, something he never had a problem with before. 
My mom stayed at my apartment the last three weeks. There was a lot of nights I stayed up waiting for her to stumble in from the bar. There were also a lot of nights I ignored the whole situation and stayed at a friends house instead. One of the latter nights she never made it home. She showed up the next day with a swollen face and claimed she had fallen. I can’t even look at her, her face is completely blue/purple. I’ve seen injuries from falling face first drunk, I’ve fallen fast first drunk. Her injury did not look like those. She finally told me the truth (or at least a version of the truth I hope) and admitted a homeless man punched her and she was knocked out on the ground, late at night, piss drunk. She ubered to a friends house and the next morning ubered to three different ER/Urgent cares before someone would help her (the assumed domestic violence and wouldn’t treat her I guess?) She tried to see if her place was ready for her to move back in a few days early. All because she was trying to hide this from me and my brothers. I wish so badly she trusted me enough to call me and let me help her. 
I’ve never told her to her face that I think she has a problem with alcohol but that day when I came home and saw my mom looking like that and trying to shrug it off I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I avoided sharing my feelings with her because I was afraid she would push herself even further away, become even more sneaky, and eventually pass away in a hospital bed, alone, because ‘She didn’t want to worry us’ or she was too embarrassed to tell us the real story.

2021-04-05 21:05:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mkzsex/70_days_sober_today_heres_7_quotes_that_have/,70 Days Sober Today - Here's 7 Quotes that have Helped Me to 10 Weeks,"My last post here for my one month kinda blew up, and I was brought to tears reading the comments. Although all the comments were moving, the ones that moved me the most weren't the ones showing support, but the ones that said I was an inspiration for them to keep on going. 

I know 10 weeks sober is a lot less than some of you here, but I also know that it is a more than most people on this Sub. For those struggling with the first few days or weeks, I've compiled a short list of quotes and a brief explanations that helped inspire me along the way in the hopes that it can help at least one of you in some way. They aren't in an exact order, but each quote explanation somewhat builds on the last. These are some of the things I wish I knew when I started. 

&#x200B;

***“If you walk 10 miles into a forest, you need to walk 10 miles to get out”***

Remember that the damage you have done to yourself over the months or years, whether it be physical, mental, or spiritual, will not heal within days, weeks, or even months. I know it’s been hammered into us at this point that most of us suffer from wanting immediate gratification due to technology, and as annoying as it is, it is true. The walk out of the “forest” will take time, and you won’t see all the good that will come out of immediately, but remember to be grateful for the sights along the way. The first week is the hardest, do not be deterred. Cherish the mornings without hangovers and find little things to be grateful for everyday, even if the things you are grateful for are so small that they go unnoticed to everyone else, don’t let it go unnoticed to you. If you walk 10 miles into a forest, you need to walk 10 miles to get out.

&#x200B;

***“To get something you’ve never had, you have to do something you’ve never done”***

Most, if not all, the events in our lives have been directly related to actions you have done to reach where you are now. Take ownership in that every situation you’ve ever found yourself in, however indirect, is in some way, shape, or form, your own fault. I know that sounds overwhelming, but if you can put yourself in that headspace, you begin to realise that you are the only one capable of making any change in your life. Take responsibility for all the good you have done in your life, but also for all the bad you have done. Make peace with it, and learn from it. Visualise where you want to be, and know that in order to achieve that, you may need to face challenges you have never faced before. To get something you’ve never had, you have to do something you’ve never done. 

&#x200B;

***“When you ask God for strength, does he give you strength? Or does he give you opportunities to be strong?”*** 

I’m not religious or spiritual in anyway, but this one stuck with me. Think back to the times in your life that you had to be strong, to be patient, to be compassionate. It is in these times that you chose to be strong that you understand that perhaps it is not fair to ask life to give you strength, but to act rightly and correctly when the opportunity to be strong presents itself.

At the times when life has beaten you to your knees, do not ask why it is you that has to endure all this suffering, instead, realise that life has given you the opportunity to show exactly how strong you are. Understand that even if you’ve think you’ve hit rock bottom, the floor can still break through, do not let it break through. When you ask God for strength, does he give you strength? Or does he give you the opportunities to be strong?

&#x200B;

***""Do not use your illness as an excuse, as soon as you do that you cannot tell the difference between the illness and your character""***

Never use your illness or addiction as an excuse to not do something that you should do. This does not mean that your illness does not handicap you in some way, but never, ever use it as an illegitimate excuse for doing something you know you should be doing. Every time you do that, the illness and your character becomes more intertwined, and eventually you will be unable to differentiate who you are as a person from the illness itself - do not give it that power. Do not use your illness as an excuse, as soon as you do that you cannot tell the difference between the illness and your character.

&#x200B;

***“The only thing nobel about victimhood is overcoming it”***

In the same vein as the previous quote, always remind yourself that there is nothing to be proud of in victimhood except overcoming it. We have all been victims in one way or another, we have all had bad done to us and we have all suffered greatly from it, but do not let being a victim become part of your identity. It’s okay, healthy even, to feel bad when you have been wronged, especially if the one doing the wronging was you to yourself, but understand that that trauma does not define who you are, nor is the trauma itself anything to be proud of. The only thing noble about victimhood is overcoming it. 

&#x200B;

***“There’s still time to become the person you want to be”***

Everyone loves a success story, but even more than a success story, everyone loves a story about someone who messes up their life completely and gets their life together again. You can fully mess up your life, you can really fuck it all up, you can lose everything you cared about, you can be homeless, alone in the world, you can reach a point where even if you were to disappear no one would notice, and even then you can turn it around and become who you want to be. There is no deadline in life except death itself. There is still time to become the person you want to be.

&#x200B;

***“True recovery happens when one can no longer understand how they survived the suffering. When it seems more like a distant nightmare than an actual event of the past.”*** 

At one point, you’ll look back and ask yourself how you ever even had the capability to put yourself through what you did. You’ll try to remember what it was like and realise that it feels impossible to even imagine yourself in such a mental and physical state. It is at this point that you will realise that you are “over it”. Do not search for this realisation, it will come to you when you least expect it, and it comes at different times for everyone. One day you’ll be going about your business and it’ll cross your mind, you’ll recall how bad things were, how hopeless and desperate everything seemed, the seemingly unsurmountable amounts of suffering you endured, and ask yourself “how did I ever live through that?”. True recovery happens when one can no longer understand how they survived the suffering. When it seems more like a distant nightmare than an actual event of the past.

For those flirting with the idea of sobriety, I recommend acting on it. By now I'm sure you've all read the positive improvements that people experienced after becoming sober, so there's no point in me repeating the ones I have. All I can say is that on every possible metric, my life is better.

I’d been feeling the distance rapidly growing, but was doing my best to chalk it up to anxiety and emotional turmoil associated with my not drinking. I finally decided to ask her point blank today, and she admitted she was not interested in taking our relationship any further. 

I’ve got 21 days, and this is my 3rd attempt at sobriety in the past 12 months. She had a lot to do with it, bc she’s not a drinker and I realized I didn’t want to keep secrets from someone I liked so much. Regardless, I’m definitely asking myself what the fucking point of any of it is today. 

I picked up an extra shift at work tonight, so hopefully that will help with the stress and sadness. I actually wish I could have been home this afternoon to take a long bike ride at the lake  or actually go to a meeting. I don’t want to be alone. 

Still, I will not drink today, and it will be the first time in my living memory that I will confront this kind of hard sadness (edit: while sober, obviously.) 3 months is nothing, but I am old and desperate. I’ve got a lot of work to do.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.68248135}"

It somehow feels like 2 days and 2 decades. 2 years ago today I decided to enter treatment for addiction. I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. But I luckily knew enough to know that I could no longer drink or use safely. I had broken my collarbone and cheekbone a few days earlier in a black out. I was physically broken. More importantly, I was internally broken. The relief and escape that alcohol had initially provided me was no longer working. The medicine had turned to madness as they say. I was desperate, hopeless, lost, and confused. 

For me, sobriety has been the most difficult and also the most rewarding experience I’ve ever had. Putting down the drink and drug was just the tip of the iceberg. Everyday the fog continues to clear in ways I could never have imagined 730 days ago. When I was drinking, I felt stuck. I didn’t have any options. Today I have an abundance of tools at my disposal. I have people to call and I have my own sanity to trust.

And it's absolutely true! No argument here. But is there something you watched that helped you or that you keep in mind as you go along in your sobriety as well?

Several years ago, my husband and I started watching **NYPD Blue** (which for the younger folks was a police drama in the 90s - omg so good, but I digress).  Dennis Franz played Detective Sipowicz who in the first season was an alcoholic who eventually tried to get his shit together by getting sober, doing AA, being better at his job, and mending some familiar relations.  It shows him rationalizing/bargaining and relapsing and then getting back on the right path again.  It is one of the most honest depictions of alcoholism I think I've ever seen and it helped me to realize my drinking was problematic.

Also, I am in the middle of **""Doctor Sleep""** (the book, not the show) which is a sequel to The Shining by Stephen King.  The telepathic child (Danny) from the first book is an adult struggling with trauma and alcoholism. His internal dialog about it and what kind of person it makes him, especially when he recalls his father's struggles with alcohol, is so spot on, tangibly real, and relatable.

Valentine's day hit and something triggered my urges again and I've been stuck binging multiple times a week again. I'm angry at me, I hate that I put myself in this spot again.

Not going to lie this has been the most I’ve been tempted since getting sober at the end of February. I didn’t really have any cravings/temptations during March but I did A LOT this past weekend. 

As soon as we got there, my cousin had a Corona (mixed with vodka and grenadine) already opened waiting for us. I thought about drinking it as it looked SO GOOD and it felt rude to decline a drink she had gone out of her way to make me. I told her I’m not drinking anymore which she totally understood. 

The next day we went down to one of the piers/beaches in San Diego. I was walking around the surrounding neighborhood with my cousin and Grandpa and they wanted to find a place to get a beer at. We found this pizza place that had beer. I was so tempted to get one as it was a nice day by the beach. BUT luckily the pizza place had Coors Edge (which I personally don’t like the taste of but it still beats throwing away a month of sobriety) 

That same day we ended up going to Pechanga and I was again tempted to drink but again my will power overcame my temptations.

If you are are not familiar, learn about it. We put our bodies thru hell for an extended period. It is not typically going to recover from this in a short period of time. The effects of 10 years of drinking isn't going away in a few months. Be kind to yourself.


2. We *trained* our people to treat us the way they do. But sometimes when we get a little sobriety under our belt, we start to get annoyed with them for the ways they react to us. They are not in our head, they don't know how we really feel. That is time is different. So when they question actions that in the past meant we were or might be drinking, remember that WE trained them to think that way. Be kind to them.


3. As we get further into sobriety, we can sometimes feel that the time we have is a shield. But sobriety is walking along the beach. No matter how far we have gotten, the water is still right there. It ebbs and flows and if we are not paying attention, it can sneak up and get us again.

Not sure yet if I’m aiming to stop completely, but definitely contemplating it. I don’t do well with strict rules, so I’m trying not to make etoh a forbidden fruit. But somewhere along the way, I’ve realized just how tied up booze was to my disordered eating. 

I say disordered now, but at one point in college it was full on eating disorder (my BMI was 16). It was in college that I started associating alcohol with the only time I would allow myself to eat. I remember taking a 2 week break from booze while studying abroad and losing even more weight during that time. My conclusion? Alcohol is the only thing keeping me alive. Sick thinking at its finest, ladies and gentlemen. But I believed it for years. Even after my ex fiancé died from alcohol at age 28, and I hated booze with a vengeance, I couldn’t shake that belief and still didn’t stop drinking. 

Endowing alcohol with the secret to life was clearly not healthy. I would starve all day to increase the effects of booze, then binge eat ravenously, thus reinforcing my association between alcohol and food. Then the next day would be all starvation and regret to punish myself for the breech in will power. You can imagine the neediness, the clutching, clawing, anxious desperation that consumed my life. Alcohol was the only relief to that too. 

Now that I’m drinking so much less, going weeks between a drink, I’ve also changed my relationship with food. It is nourishing me, literally filling me, and I don’t have to spend all my days in yearning, starvation, or regret. Ive been lifting weights and eating tons of veggies and protein.

My wife has left me I'm now staying an hour and a half away at my parents after drinking all weekend in a motel and if it wasn't for Easter Sunday having all the liquor stores closed I had planned to get my last bottle spend my last day on Earth. On top of the guilt the shame the pain that comes with relapse I accept now that I've really done it this time. I video chatted my kids they're crying and they want me home and they  don't understand they're 18 months and 4 years old. My wife never let the kids come see my parents in the past but my daughter is crying to come see them now because she knows I'm here. I have one week to get my s*** together only back at work which is an hour and a half drive from here I don't know what I'm going to do or where I'm going to live I'm not going to drink today I have no desire to have a drink again I hope I feel like that for the rest of my life because she is things are I think I can still fix them enough to be a part of my kids lives. This is used as time and time again taking everything from me and cause me to restart my life countless times build everything up just to throw it away. I must now accept that things will never go back to the way they were before. I was the one to get the kids to sleep every night. I would rock my 18month old son and sing then read to my daughter. Through all the pain and heartbreak I feel myself and know my wife and kids feel the thought does linger to drink myself to death. It may be more painful for them in the short term but how can I guarantee the pain won't continue as Ive failed countless times and continue to.

So it was the Easter holiday. Four days without work or school, what a great time to get drunk it is. I messaged a few friends, got some booze and off we go. I blacked out, drunk texted my ex from many years back, and didn't remember anything about it. I also embarrassed myself in front of some people I have to be in contact with quite frequently. I'm not sure what else have I done. That happened on Thursday, and I'm still feeling like I haven't slept in many nights. My digestive system is fucked, and I can't focus. This is not the first time.

I think the pandemic got me to slowly realize that my drinking really is not in control. The last year I have drunk way less than ever before while being adult. Before, and many months in the pandemic I was telling myself how I'm drinking much less than my friends. My friends drink huge amounts of alcohol. The thing is, I don't stay functioning with half of the alcohol they drink, so comparing to them is useless. About one in third or in fourth time I end up drinking too much too fast, and then it usually goes totally out of control. Usually I drink once a week. In the last year, maybe once a month or less.

If nothing changes, it's only a matter of time it all backfires very bad, so I think it's time to start doing stuff to prevent it. I'm aiming for being fully sober for a few months, and then think again how I should proceed. I have no problem for example, tasting some whiskeys by myself, but being around people (via voice chat or f2f) makes me wanting too much courage from the bottle. I'm not sure if I should just skip all the socializing that could involve alcohol, or try to attend those things sober.

Never the less, I hope getting blacked out for fun -type of activities are over for me. Not worth it at all. I'm a bit scared about this as I've had the same opinion for years, but I still find myself in those quite frequently.",10,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.70087457}"

2021-04-05 10:58:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mkmn43/my_recovery_story/,My recovery story,"I woke up on August 9th. It was 4:30 in the morning and I was in my clothes on top of my bedspread. I knew my friend had driven me home and got me egg drop soup. I knew I was safe. Then I started checking my phone. Facebook. Emails. Texts. I had posted a video online for my students. I watched it. I didn’t say anything bad, but it was obvious I was drunk. Oh my god! I took it down. Only 13 views - but I was going to lose my job. Earlier that week, my son had had his dad come pick him up because he didn’t feel safe. I had come home drunk ON his birthday. His birthday! I was going to lose my job and my son. I couldn’t just not drink when I had him. I had to stop drinking. My daughter knew it was bad and had offered to take my son for a week while I straightened myself out. After dropping him off that day, I didn’t even make it through the day sober. I hit the bar at closing time and had three drinks. I couldn’t even make it one day without drinking. The next day after a disappointing doctor appointment where he dismissed my concerns and said I didn’t need the surgery that I had just had, I went to the bar and 2 turned into 7. I can’t moderate. I was devastated that this doctor had blown me off, but drinking didn’t change that. I have got to stop drinking!

On Wednesday, I met with my boyfriend and listened to him tell me all about drunk me during the past week when I came home drunk on my son’s birthday. He had left me at the bar because I was acting so crazy. As he spoke, all I could think was, “I can never be “drunk me” again”. I went home feeling mortified and in despair. I didn’t talk to anyone. I was so embarrassed that I could not figure out drinking and for all the shit that had transpired since Covid started. I didn’t know how to do life without drinking, but my life was bad because I couldn’t handle my drinking.

These thoughts consumed me in my early days of sobriety. I couldn’t talk to my boyfriend because I had all but destroyed our relationship with “drunk me”. I couldn’t tell any of my friends because I really didn’t have any non drinking friends and I was too embarrassed. I felt like a failure. School was about to start, and that was a shit show in and of itself. My son came back and I had to be sober. I didn’t think I was bad enough for AA and I didn’t think I was an alcoholic. I was just someone who couldn’t handle her drinking. That made me feel like a failure. I finally told a colleague that I was quitting drinking because it was too much with the new school year and the new school. I could text her everyday with my day count and she would cheer me on. 

I have someone in my life who I used to be close to who is sober, but my drinking and drama filled life ended that friendship. I commented on a post of hers that I hadn’t had a drink in 6 days. We started messaging. She invited me to some sober mom groups on FaceBook. That was a thing? I began to post on there and people understood and supported me. Wow! I kept trying to find something to help me because I was just barely keeping everything going and staying sober. Supporting my son who was struggling with quarantine and starting a new school online. I felt overwhelmed at work because I was always in an alarmed state because my anxiety was through the roof with PAWS (post acute withdrawal symptoms). I told all my bar friends I was not drinking. I would still go because I was going crazy at home. But, I didn’t drink. I didn’t even want to. But I was a huge ball of nerves. I kept looking for anything that was not AA. Finally after I was 2 weeks sober, I told my daughter and my doctor. My daughter didn’t react because it wasn’t the first time I had told her I was quitting. My psychiatrist prescribed a new anti-anxiety drug because I wasn’t drinking. Wait? There was another med that I could have gotten to help with my anxiety as long as I wasn’t drinking and you never told me about that? Are you shitting me? I felt like I was proving myself to my boyfriend and my daughter. My first real moment of, “Oh my God! I need a drink.” was after helping my son with his homework. I had always drank when I was helping him with homework. I found a SheRecovers meeting and they cheered that I didn’t drink.  Maybe I had found meetings that would work. But, I still felt like I was searching. Does anyone know how hard it is to be a mom and not drink? Does anyone know how hard it is to be a teacher in 2020 and NOT drink? I found a recovery coach and met some people in AA. I went to a few meetings. Got my 30 day chip (my daughter came) and that was cool, but it wasn’t a good fit. Sober Mom Squad started on September 4th and I felt like, “Oh. This is my group.” Then, my sober mom friend said to try TLC. I came to my first meeting at 36 days. It was huge! I made more sober friends here in Colorado. People were so helpful in connecting me to other people. But, I was running ragged. Teaching full time. Parenting my son 5 days a week. Not sleeping at all. (I drank to sleep) and then my son had minor surgery. I picked my daughter up to help me. I had just listened to Ch 5 in Quit Like A Woman that stated that there was not a blood test for being an Alcoholic. That it wasn’t even a medical term. That alcohol is fucking addictive and I am not a bad person because I got addicted. I texted my daughter to listen to just that chapter. When I got to her house, she gave me small canvas she had painted for being 1 month sober. It was so sweet and I felt so supported. 

Four days later I got Covid. In the middle of all this shit, I got Covid. I now see those three weeks as the rehab I never got. I slept, listened to Laura’s book (I felt finally seen by a mom who struggled with drinking and did some crazy shit when she was drunk her), and I went to meetings non stop. I met Marie, the dear friend I never knew I needed- another single mom teacher who got it. She told me to let school go and just get better. Getting me to give up and not be “super teacher” was a huge step for me. My first week back from Covid, I feel fell apart that Friday trying to hold everything together. And I had my first aha moment in recovery - I drank so I wouldn’t fall apart because single mom’s aren’t supposed to fall apart. I started therapy when everything was spinning in those first 6 weeks and he was the first person to point out that I had a pretty fucked up childhood and not to gloss that over. No wonder I drank. There were moments the pain of truly looking at my childhood was going to kill me, and he said to take it in bite size chunks. 

I experienced a lot of painful moments in that part of my recovery that I had otherwise drank my way through. I started writing to process and I started a recovery blog called the Teacher Mom Alcohol Lie. I had had both areas of my life lie to me that I needed alcohol to manage them. I almost died when I was born (like 5 times) and my parents at one point gave up and accepted I was going to die. But, mother fucker, I lived and they never made it back to loving me and nurturing me. Something like 60% of us in recovery have attachment issues. It’s a thing, y’all. My older sister terrorized and beat me up through most of my childhood and that was blown off as normal. I lived in fear of her whenever mom and dad left the house. I didn’t have friends because I didn't know how to make them. I attempted suicide in 7th grade and my counselor told me - yeah that makes sense with everything you had going on. I was assaulted in college after I had been drinking and my family had no idea how to handle that. I was assaulted by a priest the next year, and I didn’t ever tell them that. My relationships were all trauma choices because I had no idea what love was. If you were nice to me and didn’t hurt me, that must be love. Facing all of this was all part of my early recovery. My marriages were trauma choices and I didn’t really experience love till I had my children. It was the first time in my life I wasn’t hustling for love. My love addiction came out after my divorces as a power play trying to fill that whole. Alcohol was a big part of that. Probably also a result of my sexual assaults. 

In the past three months, I have learned how to be alone. I am trying to reestablish my relationship with my boyfriend but once you start learning and knowing, you can’t unknow. I don’t know how that is going to play out. I am killing it as a teacher now that I am not drinking. Imagine that, not being hungover helps you deal with 7th graders instead of behaving and responding like one. My kids have watched me string together days, weeks and months. I came out on my FB page as sober around 85 days. I learned that alcohol makes anxiety worse. Celeste Yvonne wrote a great piece about anxiety attacks and alcohol. I wrote that I quit drinking because my anxiety was through the roof last summer and I wanted to see if it would help. I switched psychiatrists to someone who was honest with me about alcohol's impact on my anxiety. I started a teacher subgroup because, motherfucker, it is hard to teach sober when everyone condones and supports drinking to cope. I learned alcohol crippled my body’s response to anxiety and that I would never drink again. (Sober Powered Episode 22) I had major surgery and my daughter came down to take care of me for two weeks. She did everything. I held space for her as she shared how my drinking forced her to grow up too fast. Because sober me could do that, she forgave me. When she left after those two weeks, she started to cry as we hugged goodbye. She pulled back and sobbed, “I am going to miss you so much. I will come back down on my next day off and take care of you.” I was able to be an adult with her during those two weeks and not a mom. Sober me could never have done that. Sober me was able to get off pain meds in 7 days. Sober me has the honor of supporting newly sober moms in the SIS program for Sober Mom Squad and so many other newly sober people. And I am privileged enough to support some of you. My anxiety is now well managed with meds. I am confronting my disordered eating and learning to love my body. Learning is the operative word in that phrase. 

It all started with breaking up with drunk me. I shared recently that a couple of Fridays ago, I wanted to drink. My surgery recovery was stalling out, and everyday was a saga of whether or not I could go to the bathroom. I had this surgery to fix my issues with going to the bathroom, and after all that, I couldn’t poop. I was so worn out after three weeks and alone because my daughter had gone back to Fort Collins and I wanted to stop hurting. For so many of us, that is all our drinking was about- wanting to stop hurting.  I was able to play it forward and think about how it wouldn’t be a 12 hour break from my body. It was going to make me more trapped in my body because drunk me, who was also sad and overwhelmed, would have been a shit show. I didn’t drink, and that took about a week to process how close I was to drinking.  I could forgive myself for having the thought and tell her, “I see you. We don’t do that anymore.” Thanks, Mulrooney. Everything I have hustled for in my life I am now finding in my sobriety. It has been the hardest almost 8 months ever and I am closer to what I have always wanted for myself. I have learned my thoughts can lie.My emotions can’t kill me. Meetings are life. And you really can build friendships with people who you see on a screen. I am honored to walk this recovery road  with you and to share this with you today.",42,"{'covid': 4, 'quarantine': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.86612415}"

I posted on here Friday night before bed that I had been feeling down and ashamed of myself for that slip up. I am the type of person that struggles to let go of emotional disruptions like this regardless if it's something that went wrong at work or in my personal life or just drinking too much and letting someone down, it sticks in my mind and I mentally beat myself up about it. 

Moving forward, I am going to do my best to be better than I was yesterday, I've been down the road of, ""I knew what would happen if I drank, but I did anyway"" more than enough times. It's time to focus on myself again and stop getting in my own damn way. I could have accomplished a handful of personal goals over the last 2-3 years had I just gotten out of my own damn way and even cut my alcohol consumption in half, but I didn't and here I am with those same goals. Replacing all of that empty drinking time is going to be one of the biggest hurdles going forward, so over the weekend I decided to dive back into some past hobbies and that helped me pass the time.

Which is great! And I want to keep it going.

But I’m afraid to leave because I feel like I don’t have the skills to work at a different marketing job. I graduated college in marketing but I feel like I’ve forgotten everything.

Driver was blacked out drunk.,"My family and I were sitting out back at my brother and sister-in-law's place in hammocks, enjoying our after-Easter sober hang with homemade donuts when we heard a ear-splitting crash from the front yard, as an SUV plowed through some trees, and over a rock wall.  No squealing brakes, full speed. We immediately called 911 and my brother and husband ran over to the car.

The driver had already gotten out of the car and kept saying ""All good"" on repeat as he gathered his stuff and got on his phone.  Couldn't answer any other questions or say if there was anyone else in the car. He was barely coherent. Definitely was NOT all good.  Trees demolished, rock wall demolished, and the car was totaled.  He managed to miss a telephone pole (by driving through the triangle between the pole and wire), and the trees eventually kept him from heading into an even steeper ditch. One lucky son-of-a-bitch.  

The first responders and cops came, and we watched him fail his sobriety test and get cuffed. Took hours to clean up the mess. It brought me right back to the times I was pulled over for drunk driving.  Unfortunately, I had to lose a lot more to finally accept that I cannot drink in safety.  

I don't judge this man, as I get it.  We all get it.  However, it was a firsthand, sobering (literally) account of the dangers of driving drunk. What if my sister-in-law was checking the mail?  What if the neighbor was out with her baby in the stroller taking their daily walk? What if someone had been in the passenger seat?  What if the rock wall wasn't there and he continued into the ditch?  Seeing how many first responders it took to clean up an accident that happened in less than 5 seconds was mind-boggling.  

I hope that guy gets the help he needs.  Maybe his drinking doesn't look like mine, and today's accident will be enough for him to make some changes.  I drove home sober with my husband later, and said a little prayer of gratitude for my own recovery, and for those homemade donuts. I hope someone else hears what they need to from this story.  Seeing it firsthand sure as hell put it all in perspective for me. There is a better way to live, and you just have to do it one day at a time.

I keep racking my brain to remember when is the last time I went this long AF. I failed at Dry January at Day 13. And the last I can remember is the 90 days I did in work release for violating probation with a DUI. That was back in 2008...whew. 

First couple weekends were hard for me - cravings and urges reared their head but this 3day weekend, despite nice weather...was easier and I'm glad it was. 

Saturday we had Easter Brunch as my sisters. I brought a couple LaCroix and some lemon/lime wedges to enjoy. At first - I saw no one was drinking and became kind of annoyed assuming it was because of me (we're a big drinking family and everyone ""talks"") - but after a bit of observation, I noticed it wasn't because of me...It was because none of them bothered to bring their own alcohol. My sis and her husband rarely drink so why would they have it? I generally brought my own and didn't mind sharing but the fact that they didn't bother to bring anything but were looking around for some, made me laugh. But that was never anything new, so noticing it sober was just one of those ""ha"" moments. 

Later that afternoon we had our buddies come by wings and burgers. We're pretty close so I let them know ""Monday is my 3week AF, I feel great"" - nothing more needed to be said (on my part) to let them know I wouldn't be drinking with them that day. Interestingly enough - I didn't feel the whole ""I can't drink"" sorry-for-myself feeling I thought I would. Rather, it was ""I don't drink"" and I felt fine with that. I was able to observe my husband, son (23) and friends after 1, 2....4+ beers and the progression was....interesting. I liked seeing everyone let loose and I was having fun catching up and laughing, but I noticed they weren't. 

Over and over I kept hearing that I wasn't fun. Or they weren't having fun bc I was sober. Or some form of ""those"" comments. This came from our friends, but mostly my son. I am known for being ""fun"" drunk but also fun sober...so I didn't get it. I finally got so annoyed with it and told them ""I AM having fun....why aren't you? If you need me to drink to have fun, there's something wrong with you"" - I said it gently but meant it with my heart. 

I told my son yesterday over dinner that I don't want to hear those comments. I have made an effort not to change their lives/habits/FUN just because I chose to not drink. I don't want to tell them not to have people over bc their comments annoy me. They either figure out a way to enjoy me sober or don't plan on drinking at home - chose wisely. 

I don't feel wrong - but am I wrong? Sober he still held the same opinion, that I wasn't as much fun. So I can't chalk this all up to ""drunken talk"" but nonetheless - if it continues, I won't want to be around them. And I'm trying not to kill the vibes when people are over so I don't know what gives. 

Not sure what I'm looking for - probably just needed to journal this and rant. I know I'm not wrong...and in a way they're probably not either - but need to figure out a middle ground.

However, when it returned a couple of months later after a particularly horrible night of drinking to tell me, ""this would be a hell of a way to go out!"" I finally took it to heart. IT WAS ROUGH, breaking all the different habitual triggers for grabbing a drink but I did it. I never fully agreed to quit completely to myself or others but as the months stacked up I had to decide my ""end game"". I told myself a year & in that time truly analyzed my relationship with alcohol through meditation (which I had been doing previously). I read ""This Naked Mind"" like many of you & it was brilliant & not having to put a label on what I wanted to accomplish made things more comfortable. 

The bottom line...over the past 6 months I would allow myself to have a few drinks whenever I felt like it. But ""feeling like it"" was rare. These past couple of weeks I started ""drinking again"".  I am not ok with it by any means, gave myself Easter as the cutoff. The point of my long-winded (sorry) post is this.  I really have been viewing my behaviors almost as an outsider watching from above (a meditation technique). I've seen the sneakyness (drinking more beers privately than what I show publicly). I've had the debate (am I gonna drink today, fuck it, I did yesterday). I've been hungover (don't miss this bullshit) and finally I've felt the guilt & shame. 

Time has helped me forget all this shit but I'm very in tuned with my feelings bc alcohol has not completely numbed me as in the past. 

So no this is not a complete failure, in fact it's not a failure at all bc I will go back to my new toolbox and rebuild my sobriety again and I have ALL OF YOU as some of the best tools I possess!!!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It was not easy, but I got through it and  felt strong and powerful and actually got to a point where I didn´t miss alcohol.

Then I allowed myself to drink a bit for Easter. I wanted to be able share a nice craft beer and a good glass of wine over easter lunch with my family and friends.

And now, about a week later, I´ve been through at least 18 bottles of wine and a box of beers. Just on my own. I am back to finding excuses to start drinking early in the day, in the morning: Its a holiday. I am on my own, no one will know. I will stop soon. The wine is mixed with soda, its not very strong. I will take an extra long morning walk with my dog if I can just bring a drink with me.   And then a beer when I get home. A beer for lunch. Switch to wine mixed with soda, later pure wine.

It´s an experiment, I tell myself. I want to see what attracted me to alcohol, and there is one thing: I can be shy and akward around strangers, but alcohol helps me to relax and trust them and feel more connected.

Otherwise it just makes everything worse.

I feel bloated and stiff and 10 kg heavier. My sleep is disrupted again, I wake up in the middle of the night and start thinking... Constantly in a daze that is not happy. My skin gets dry and cracked around my mouth and eyes. I eat shitty food = I have no energy. I used to do yoga every morning for the past three months. Just a few sun salutations to get the blood flowing, but it made a huge difference for how my day went. With drinking I made it to day two before I quit, I was too stiff.I hate this feeling that is a mix of being hungover and slightly unhappy drunk.

It is my dogs birthday tomorrow. My gift to her is that I will stop drinking again, and give her lots of walkies and playtimes.

And for me of course, I want to get back to the happy and proud and productive sober me.

Downloaded this naked mind audiobook and started it today, on chapter 3 and already getting deep. ""Can you pinpoint it (the moment of losing control)?""

That year i was invited spontaneously to go out of school with some of the ""cool kids"" to smoke cigarettes. Desperate to have something to share with someone I accept and started hanging with them. A year later i'm smoking weed with them in a park but soon realised that i don't like the drug and comes summer of my 16th birthday. I'm in a small town and most of the people i know are away, so a cluster of us start meeting up every day none of this party were part of the old crowd, they were outcasts. Like me! We bond and we drink beers to pass the time, then we start stealing booze frome our parents and making awful mixtures with liquors.I wake up in hospital after drinking a bottle of vodka pretty much solo mid afternoon.

But then it's back to school, and i realize that i no longer have a place in the first group and the second one starts disintegrating due one of us dying in a car crash.

I meet Cindy. The most outcast of outcasts of the highschool. We drink smoke and breathe ether before classes. It's all good fun, i have an identity, i disregard the rules, I'm a rebel. That whole year she is pretty much my only friend and me hers. The next part is a blur my mother put me in a private school after and then i moved to the uk to go to a photography college. Made more outcast friends there and would head out to the pub under the pretext of taking pictures.

Made more friends outside of college that took extasy and cocaine but i stuck to alcohol. One of the older guys seems to enjoy my company, we end up playing chess regularly. He always wins. He drugs me and I wake up in his bathtub. He says i came to his place blind drunk and passed out but i was 80% sure i had not been drinking. I'm only able to be 80% sure at the age of 17! WTF!

Fast forward a few months a d my flat burns down (unrelated) and i move back to France to my mothers. I'm alone again. I start drinking alone. Just once a week at first then find some old friends who have jobs and beer. I meet this girl, Camille, shes in an abusive relationship and has a heroin habit. I end up trying heroin. I end up buying heroin. I end up kicking myself in the ass around the age of 21 getting training as a roofer after aceing the selection process. I'm away from my hometown and old friends, away from heroin and friggin cold turkey the shit out of it. Focus on training weekend partys with bars, stay away from drugs, whatever it takes.

Training ends and i get a job, new beginning. Colleagues drink a lot and i follow to fit in but i'm not good at my job so i get shit on. 

I remember clearly sitting at home after a particularly hard day of being told i'm worthless, pulling our a bottle of whiskey and giving in, giving up. At this point i'm about 23 yo and drinking multiple bottles of ballantines per weekend and a few whiskey and cola weekday evenings.

One day i decide to move to Toulouse so i quit my job pack a bag and go. Now Toulouse is a constant party if you want it to be. And i wanted it to be. But i manage pretty easily to find a job, roofers with experience are in high demand. I meet a girl, we fall in love and for a few years i'm not drinking outside of partys but our relationship falls apart (not unrelated) and we end up trying too hard to keep it together. At the same time i'm at ""war with my employer for underpaying me. So i end up single and unemployed with a stack of money we had set aside for future plans. I don't like that money. I drink that money.

I do temp work for a bunch of different companies, still roofing, (The amout of alcohol consumption of roofers is frightening!) Until 3 years back when i severely hurt my shoulder at a concert. Stop working and move into a farm with horses, out of town. And start to drink alone. A lot. To the point where every second day i can not face any living person. 2 years pass and i finally get my shoulder operated on then the farmhouse owner is due to come back and i move back to the city.

I'm still trying to stay on top of my drink, how come my friends haven't noticed?

Then lockdown hits. And i fall far. Too far. Can't take it.

Second lockdown hits. I'm not going to survive it if i drink. So i don't and last 2 months!!! And so the repeating relaps cycle begins. I'm now here again. Determinated as ever. IWNDWYT!!!!!!!!",7,{'lockdown': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47402328}"

My husband still drinks and that's not really a problem for me. I can have his beer in the house and not sneak any of it. Been there done that. I have my own stock of AF drinks to keep me entertained. But yesterday he went out and hung out in the park with some friends he hasn't got to see in forever because of Covid. These friends are alcoholics. They're perfectly functional and unaware or not able to admit it but I know it. I didn't want to join them but after hours of texting I relented and went. I hated it. My husband was so drunk he could barely speak. The other two were plastered as well but holding it together better (because they're the alcoholics) They offered me a beer but I'd brought my own AF with me so I wouldn't be tempted but by god I was so tempted. I wanted to drink so bad because hanging out with them all was so boring and annoying. I thought ""I havnt drunk anything for ages, my tolerance will be low, one can will give me enough of a buzz to make this enjoyable and feel like I can take part in this mess"" But I played the tape forward. It wouldn't be one because I would neck that can in 5 minutes and get another because the buzz wouldn't have sunk in yet. Rinse and repeat. I would be opening my husbands whiskey the moment we got home to prolong the buzz and deal with what would come next. So I didn't drink. We left the park.

What comes next is what's making me stay in bed. The moment we get home my husbands hand is drifting up my skirt. I say no I'm not in the mood. He slurs ""really?"" and I'm firm, I say no. He's angry because it's been a while but doesn't say anything and goes to bed. It's barely 7pm. He wakes up at around 10 to piss and drink a gallon of water and doesn't speak to me and goes back to bed. He was still drunk and angry though, I could tell. I'm sorry but there is just nothing worse than sex when you're sober with someone who is off their head drunk. It would be all sour beer breath in your face, lazy touching, no interest in my pleasure, I would have to do all the work AND feel like a piece of meat at the same time. My self esteem is low enough as it is, I dont need this. 

So I stayed up super late, alone, watching Netflix and eating garbage and not the roast dinner for two we were going to have together to celebrate Easter. Great.

I woke up in bed alone and really late, wasting the day. I feel like I'm having a hangover even though I'm not. I feel really angry and annoyed that when I leave this room I'm going to have to deal with someone who's actually hungover, and I don't know if he's going to still be pissed at me or be full of anxiety and remorse this morning. Either way, I feel like I'm going to be punished for not drinking. 

I don't really know what I'm expecting to get back from this post, I guess I just want to vent a little to people who understand. Thanks for listening. I am absolutely NOT going to drink with you today.

Edit. I just wanted to say thank you to each and every person who's reached out with support, advice and their own stories today.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

A radio station in Barrie, Ontario holds a contest where listeners can call in with a story for the chance to win. Last week a woman who works in forestry for the local electric utility called in to share her story. She was working in the bush in and found a deflated, green metallic memorial balloon honouring a six year-old boy who died from a rare disease called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The balloon was released from Edwardsville, Illinois - more than 1,300 kilometres away.

There are messages of love to the boy, whose name was Noah, written on both sides of the balloon, asking those who see the balloon to learn more about HLH.

The woman shared the story and pictures with the radio station in hopes they would eventually reach Noah’s family. The radio station posted the story of the balloon on their Facebook page and it was shared 81 times, eventually making its way to the news feed of the woman who released the balloon, and the little boy’s mother, who were touched and excited to see the balloon. 

The comments from the people who read and shared the story, and then from his family and loved ones, moved me to tears. It must have been such a beautiful surprise to find out the balloon had been found in Canada, more than 1,300 kilometres away from where it started, and so many people heard the story and learned about Noah and HLH.

In honour of Noah and his family, I learned about HLH, and I’m sharing here, with all of you.

&#x200B;

I know my behaviour has not been up to any sort of reasonable standard when I was drinking heavily regularly. I've heard snippets from ex-drinking buddies about things I've said while blackout drunk. I've woken up to threatening messages sent to strangers I met the previous night that I wouldn't dream of sending if I was sober. I've made sexual advances in the most inappropriate of ways to women, when in the clear light of day I know I had no right to do so (I never did anything physical to a woman but I've certainly made some feel uncomfortable or scared). I've been mainly alcohol-free for the past three years since a drunken incident nearly lost me my job and my family, and have only blacked out once since. I'm now 50 days sober and have plans in place to make sure this is more permanent than previous periods of sobriety; I'm consciously counting sober days, I have cut people I drank with out of my life, I've ""banned"" myself from going to bars. Anyway, I digress. 

&#x200B;

The fact that such poor behaviours always coincided with me having blacked out and having little to no recollection of events has left me with massive anxiety that I've done things that I most likely have never done and have no reason to think I did. I see someone getting ""cancelled"" on social media for pulling a knife on someone? I think it's possible I did the same and that I'm getting outed next. I see someone accused of abusing their spouse? Ditto. Inappropriately touching a woman? Getting in a fight with a bouncer? Racially abusing a stranger? Nearly getting themselves killed? I think that maybe I did any of these things and just can't remember it.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to forgive myself for all I've done but it's hard to feel any sort of security when I'm constantly looking over my shoulder worrying about incidents that most likely never happened.

I have a few friends now, people who didn’t run away when I was an asshole or toxic—these people know I’m trying to beat this. (However, since I can be really toxic when in blackout, I wouldn’t have been surprised if they left) 

I’m less than 15 minutes away from day two, and while I have zero cravings I feel the automatic self judgment of myself because of my behavior that’s led to fallings out.

I’ll spare you all the details, but my parents are going through a shocking divorce.

Then after dinner, apparently an argument went down when they were in another room and my dad left abruptly. It just sucked and hurt. 

I wasn’t tempted to drink, but it increased my anxiety a ton (which has already been challenging lately), and just made me feel frustrated. Like damnit, I have to deal with ANOTHER thing?

It is Easter Monday here in Australia. It's a public holiday for us however, some of the shops are still open. I went to the local Woolies this morning for supplies to make work lunches for the week ahead. Woolies is the contraction, for Woolworths, Australian's are famous for bestowing on things. Woolworths, one of the two major grocery chains in Australia. Anyone walking into the new centre has to walk past the sister BWS\* to get to the Woolies (\*Woolies' branded liquor store chain). The way the BWS is set out there is an almost 10 x 2 metre window stocked full of brightly labelled liquors tempting man, woman and child as they walk past. It's not subliminal at all. I would have found that tempting four weeks ago. Now, I swat the thought aside. 

I remember how hard it was to challenge the desire to drink when I decided to stop about 4 1/2 years ago. The first 3 months was more of a test of will. I white knuckled through the first couple of weekends. Posting often on Hello Sunday Morning like I see many of you doing on here. The support I got from that community helped me get through and achieve 3 years of no alcohol. 

I guess what I'm saying is that even though I'm not having a hard time at the moment, I appreciate the community here. I understand the good that others early in their journey to sobriety get from this sub reddit. And, you can lapse back and still return to an alcohol free life after. I read somewhere that the more attempts a smoker has to stop smoking the better chance they will have at giving it up forever. I'm also a reformed smoker.

Tonight, my wife gets a text from one of my old drinking buddies wives wanting advice on how she coped with being married to an alcoholic.  My buddies wife is debating leaving him for binge drinking and wants to talk to my wife about it.   

This buddy knows the truth about me....the very ugly truth and I have no reason to believe that his wife didn’t know as well.  

My wife is a little confused about why she reached out to her.  She keeps saying, “you never were that bad, why does she want to talk to me?”   They are having lunch tomorrow to talk about it all.  

To say I’m losing my shit right now would be putting it mildly.   All the lies and pain and embarrassment is piling up and I’m afraid some harsh truths are going to be uncovered tomorrow that brings it all crashing down on me.    I know I should have come clean last year,  but (insert bad excuse) I didn’t.   I hid my drinking for years and now after being sober for a year, I feel like I may be exposed for the monster I really was.   

So many fucked up emotions right now and I’m so damn scared.    I worked so damn hard to save my family this last year.   I went through hell to quit it all and get myself sober.   I just can’t tell my story to my loved ones yet.  I’m not ready to be exposed.   This probably sounds stupid to a lot of you but the demons run deep in me and I am so damn scared this is going to free them once again.",17,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8314751}"

I was struck by that especially since the night before I easily drank 9+ drinks and neither felt especially drunk nor hungover the next morning. It felt dangerous, like how much do I actually have to drink to think I’d really had too much?...

Then I talked to my husband on the phone. We’re in slow the process of moving out of his mom’s house, managing our full-time jobs, and schooling our two young kids from home. He was down at his mom’s so he could get more work done and I was up at the new place with the kids about an hour away. I called to check in and he started crying on the phone. 

At first I thought maybe the reception was bad and breaking up, because I’ve been with this man for almost 15 years now and have literally only seen him tear up twice - when we got married and when he was explaining to our kids that one of the cats had to be put down suddenly. He was breaking down on Saturday and I know how that feels. 

I’ve broken down and he has supported me hundreds of times over the years. He has always been the steady, controlled person and I am the “passionate” (emotional) partner. When he was talking about his struggles he mentioned that he wanted to cut down/stop using weed because he felt like it wasn’t helping him.

This was the first time I felt I could admit that I also have a problem and would like to cut down/stop drinking. I told him we could do it together, supporting each other. 4, 3, 2, 1. Let’s do this.

It’s been a rough year, and the past few months have been brutal because of some family violence and trauma - thus the move. I thought he was OK, but he’s not. And that’s OK. It’s my turn to be the strong, reliable, person who takes on a heavier load. 

But I can’t effectively help him or anyone if I drink, especially not how I have been this past year. I know some days will be really hard, days when I want to celebrate, it’s Friday, am bored, or cooking.... maybe some day I’ll be able to be the person again who just has one beer and is ok with that, but for now I know I cant stop at one so my only option is to not start.

I might fall on my face but I have so many many good reasons to stop now and no reasons to continue. Thank you, u/watercolorkiller. It may have seemed small but  it was something to push us over the edge. Even if I fail, I can still remember that that was the day I started trying, the day things started to change. So here we go. Time to be my own hero, one day at a time.

While visiting my parents, a family friend (also vaccinated) showed up as a total surprise to me. This person brought lots of alcohol, and pointedly said with an exasperated tone, ""can I pour you a glass of wine or are you *still* not drinking it?"" I picked up my fizzy water and said, ""I'm good, I have my drink right here."" She said, ""Next time I'll bring gin and we can drink that instead."" She knows very well I'm not drinking. She put a full glass of wine in front of me anyway, so I moved seats and ignored it. (I also noticed she drank it along with her own glass before dinner was served.)

My parents are very supportive of my sobriety, and they've even stocked fizzy waters for me. I was not exactly tempted to drink, but it was jarring to have someone disrespect my boundaries in that way, and I remembered that past holidays were ""excuses"" for me to get drunk. This past year has been very peaceful in my home with no alcohol around, spending all holidays by myself, and nobody drinking around me. As I head back into the company of others, I will need to really be mindful of being around social drinkers. Re-emersion into society will bring triggers of my old party days... I stayed strong, but I was surprised at the sense of longing for social drinking as I was suddenly back in the company of others. I need to channel ""the joy of isolation sobriety"" into this re-emergence into society.

Lately it has resulted in me blacking out drunk 3-4 nights a week. It got bad over the past past 4 years when I got a new boss who is sadistically narcissistic. I also found out through Ancestry DNA that my father was not my biological father. This all crushed my confidence and I drank away my pain. I recently started therapy and have been making great progress and got a new job! I now want to work on my drinking and stop numbing myself.

They’re to the point that their body is literally shutting down but refusing to seek treatment because they think they can battle quitting/moderating on their own. 

They’re to the point of physically being sick every day. They can barely keep any food down at any time of day. They know they have to stop but their work (bartender) and their roommates (also drunks/alcoholics) are obviously not a good environment to try to do this.

A few months ago they told me they have to have at least 3 shots in the morning to even function. And I have no idea how much they drink throughout the rest of the day.

They have no health insurance and I’m fairly certain they’re afraid to seek any kind of medical treatment because they’re scared of learning how bad off they actually are.

I’m afraid if they don’t get a handle on this quickly their likely not going to see another trip around the sun.

I have been sober for the better part of the past 4 years. I have offered them to move in with me, away from their vices, and I’m in a place where I could financially support them while they seek treatment and/or recover. 

I’m really hoping they decide to seek help before they wind up in the hospital. But at this point that might be the only way they will finally get help. I’m just afraid by that point it may be too late.

For any of you who have been in a similar situation what were your options for seeking treatment? I think part of the hurdle is being able to navigate the healthcare system/rehab to get treatment. If they were to quit their job to get treatment would Medicare cover it? How does that work? 

Outpatient suggestions also welcome as I think they may be more open to that route.

 I got out of rehab recently and made it 3 days before I caved and drank a 5th of vodka on the 4th night. What followed were the most intense WDs I've ever experienced, which landed me in the hospital for 4 days. The doctors gave me ativan but it didn't really help so it was 4 days of agony, no sleep, and being terrified of having seizures. 

All this after just a single night of drinking. it used to take week-long benders to put me in WDs. This is when it finally hit me that this HAS to be the last time. I can never safely get drunk again. This is a terrifying thought as someone who has more than a few relapses under their belt. I know the WDs get worse each time but I had no idea I was at this stage.

I'm still fairly young (29), so the years and years ahead of me that I will need to remain completely sober seem daunting. I've never made it even a year before. 

I'm honestly terrified. I only recently learned of the kindling effect, and that my brain has been damaged beyond the point of no return.

It never gets better. The best I can hope for is dulling my senses and a feeling of heavy tiredness and disinterest in the world. If not that, then nausea, vomiting, and anxiety. 

A therapist told me years ago that there must be SOME benefit to my drinking—otherwise I wouldn’t do it. I’m trying to contemplate that now, and I think the one sole benefit is that it’s comfortable. I know how I’ll go through the ritual and how I’ll feel (shitty, eventually). 

If I stop and take a look at my life, though, it’s pretty fucking great: a family, a job, close friends, enough money, flexibility with my work, nice place to live, reasonably healthy (except for the alcohol). 

Unless I stop fully, though, all of this is going to slip away. I’ve lost relationships before and my health has had some tough alcohol-related knocks. I don’t want to lose more to this disease and it feels like every time I drink I inch myself that much closer to an early demise. 

We are making plans to have kids in the near future, and I don’t want to be that drunk, absent dad. I can’t be. Somehow I have to grab this bull by the motherfucking horns and wrestle the life out of it.

I commonly bought stores out and even inspired a few to start stocking it (so I could buy it all).

But I need to put into words what has turned Dry January into a crazy sober journey.

I had my first kid at 43 and now have 2 beautiful children under 10 years old. I had decades to establish patterns of heavy drinking before having a family. My wife and I drank and smoked weed for a few years when we met, but she cut booze way way down and no weed when the kids came. I did not. My patterns were deep and I was doing what I knew. Before I met her I had spent 20 years playing rock and roll and jazz bass, working in bars, restaurants and even a stint on a cruise ship, so alcohol was always around. And if it wasn't provided, well I always had my own stash. When you work on a ship you undergo extensive safety training, and during one session with the ship's safety officer he said ""onboard, you need hobbies to keep busy, and drinking is a hobby."" Fuck I remember that gave me goosebumps and a green light! Took years to come down from that validation. 

A year and a half ago a musician buddy of mine died of a heart attack at 47. Apparently his recycling bin was full of vodka bottles, just overflowing. Bottles everywhere. That hit hard. I was on the exact same road as him, we used to drink and jam sloppy blues together. We had drifted apart before I met my wife, but we were both on the same path. Then I started a family. 

When my son was born, I felt that I would have done anything so as that he would not feel pain. I would have made a deal to endure anything so he wouldn't have to. When my daughter was born holy beans would I have done anything for my little girl not to feel hurt. Well, it seems I literally can do something. I can give my kids a life without a drunk dad. I can do the dirty work so they can be spared the shit growing up with me the way I always was. I was never violent, agressive or abusive, but after 5 on the weekend, and try as I might often during the week, I was drinking, my vodka stash ingeniously hidden on the way to the bathroom. By the time I poured my wife and I a cocktail I was usually half in the bag. She often thought I couldn't handle my booze, and in a way she was right. I could outdrink anyone, but unless I was driving I couldn't drink one. I needed all of them.

In 2020, I used covid, an impending divorce, and a few more stressful events as excuses to allow myself to drink once in a while. As it goes, once in a while evolved rather quickly into nightly drinking. I haven't been too hard on myself--overall, I've handled some significant life issues pretty well. But I cannot remember the last day I didn't drink.

I'm seeing 2 (yes, 2) therapists, and one asked me about my drinking. I shared with him the last time I quit--he asked how I did it. Part of it was this forum, so he encouraged me to get back on.

It's time. I have a new life to build, and there is so much I want to do. Drinking is a major obstacle to this.

I dont want to spend my last year in college(and my money) in online school. Had been drinking daily for about two years, pretty much since I turned 21 and plenty before. At the advice of my girlfriend I started talking to a therapist, and eventually came to the conclusion that I couldn't continue living this way, alcohol was sending me down a bad path and I didnt like the life I was living. I told my parents and a few close friends about my situation, and checked into a detox facility. After a week I got out, feeling optimistic and assured that my drinking days were over. I went to a few AA meetings, which admitted weren't exactly my cup of tea. My therapist( who himself has been sober over a decade, so I trust his advice very much) highly reccomends weekly, if not daily meetings. I dont consider myself a very religious person, so alot of the faith and ""higher power"" aspects of AA don't really do much for me. 

After a few days of sobriety after treatment, feeling not well equipped to deal with my temptations, I drank. I told my parents about my relapse and I came hope to stay with them for a few weeks. However, the temptations havent been any easier here and long story short I've snuck beer into the house on more than one occasion. Last night I was driving home from a friends house and I thought about stopping at the gas station for a 6 pack. I pulled in and turned of my car and sat there for awhile. I thought

This is never going to get easier if you dont try. You cant live like this forever. I started my car and drove home, realizing this was really one of the first times I had conquered my cravings.

So here I am, on day 2 of sobriety. I read another post on this sub that said ""having none is easier than having one"", and that really spoke to me. The stress of hiding my drinking and stealing beer from friends and the other stupid shit I've done to my loved ones and myself is too much. I'm never going to be happy if I dont take this seriously. So I'm going to give this my 100%. 

I made this post looking for anything that may have helped you in the early stages of recovery. How have you coped with the loss of alcohol? What do you do when you feel tempted and have the opportunity? I can't avoid being alone and having the cash to buy it forever. Should I give AA another chance?

I had been drinking since 16 and drinking regularly since 19. I drank a lot. From the time I was 19, I would drink every night and get absolutely sloshed on the weekends. Sloppy, text-your-ex, roll-around-on-the-floor drunk. The whole nine yards. 

This also caused me to gain a lot of weight. When I was 19 I was underweight at 140 lbs. By 23, I was 210. I had been wanting to slow down my drinking if for no other reason than to try and lose weight. Plus I figured it wasn't healthy, getting drunk every night. It hurt my wallet too. Three nights a week I was going out to bars, drinking heavily, and tipping well. A $7 drink with a $3 tip, five or six times a night added up. I was spending $50-$75 every Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday just on booze. At home, a $12 pack of beer and a bottle of whiskey was part of my weekly groceries. 

Then the pandemic hit. Bars shut down. At first, I was drinking a lot during quarantine. Then my spouse lost their job and money started getting tight. I wasn't going to bars, but I also stopped buying liquor. I couldn't afford it. I switched to cheap beer that was 3-4% alcohol and cut down to one or two beers a night. It was to save money, but I got used to it pretty fast. 

Now the pandemic looks to be drawing to a close. We got vaccinated, so we went to a bar last night to celebrate. We wore masks except at our (outdoor) table, but other than that it was what I remember as a typical bar experience, except when I paid $10 for a beer I thought, ""wow that's a lot. I'm probably good with just one beer."" So I had just one beer and went home. I thought about opening another beer at home but then I didn't. I had some tea instead. And guess what? I'm not hung over today and only spent $10 yesterday. 

Anyways, I'm not quitting outright as I don't feel like I'm at a point in my life where that's needed, but I really do think that COVID-19 got my drinking under control. I don't *need* alcohol anymore, and I'm not spending hundreds of dollars a month on literal poison. I guess if there's one silver lining to this pandemic it's that. ",6,"{'pandemic': 4, 'quarantine': 1, 'covid': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5299989}"

I was tired and sore this morning from physical activity, not from drinking. I just feel good, and am happy with where my life is going since I've stopped drinking.
Just wanted to share somethingpositive. 
Happy Sober Easter, everyone!

we are simply unable to date because we are incompatible and i realized early on but we continued to struggle for 9 months. i still miss her like crazy.

i'm not even necessarily craving alcohol right now at all to be honest.. nothings stopping me from drinking at home. what i want to do is go out on that drive because somewhere inside it makes me feel close to her. i know it'll kill me inside and bring me down because it makes me realize she's not there anymore. i did it last week before quitting and 30 minutes later i was like ""what the hell am i doing?!"" but for some reason i want to do it anyway.

To rapidly introduce myself: 31yo guy from Paris, struggling since... I don't know exactly. Maybe since I graduated from college? I'm not english-native, sorry if my words are clumsy. 

I used weed since the first lockdown to cope with the boredom and not go into a full bender. It worked most of the times, mostly when I was around people (first and second lockdowns I was not alone), now that I live by myself again and we are at our 3rd (hopefully last) lockdown here, it seems harder and harder. One day I'm fine, the next 2 days are terrible. 

I sought for help, I'm on antidepressants since a month now (Zoloft), it's working well with the anxiety (I'm writing this post right now, something I wouldn't even have thought about a month ago) but not very much when it comes to stop me from drinking. 

My strategies so far didn't work well, or at all... When my will for alcohol takes control I don't know how to stop it. Do you have any ideas of what I could try when it comes to this? Like when I'm dressing myself to go to the supermarket to buy alcohol, obviously knowing that I'm doing a mistake and fuck up my day but blinding myself?

I am depressed because I am still holding onto the past (my youth and teen years). I am still holding onto my youth years because I believe that they were unfulfilling and that I never did as much as I could with them. This is why I crave attention, so I can feel validated and have that fulfillment that I desire and can look in the mirror and say ""There see. I am worthy of recognition. My life is good"". I watched my friends go to concerts, holidays, adventures to other cities and I was always too depressed and feeling unworthy to go. This happened for 6 years and has caused my depression to be what it is today. If I took those opportunities and allowed myself to live a little, I believe that I would be a more satisfied and fulfilled person than I am today and therefore wouldn't drink to fill the void and numb the pain of regret.

I believe that this explains why I drink so excess. I still drink the stupid amounts (but on a more frequent and dependent basis) as I did as a teen in the woods with my friends somewhere, but since I don't feel like that was enough, I carried the party on into the present. Alone. I always wanted more and more. I would go down self destructive paths that I know would lead to chaos to ensure that I have a story to tell in an attempt to feel validated and respected I guess. But it only lowered peoples opinion of me. I have lost friends and family. I have been arrested 5+ times for drunken disorderly. I have buried myself into debt. I have made awful decisions that will impact my life for as long as I live. I have done terrible things that I don't believe I can ever be forgiven for. I have made myself not want to be myself. And all of this was under the influence of alcohol.

I decided to go sober after another 20+ day binge. The first few days were hell and I did drink small amounts just to ease the withdrawals but these amounts were calculated and not enough to get me drunk. On the day that I woke up and felt like I had a very minor hangover, which was about 3 days later, I decided to go for a bike ride. I counted this as my first day sober. I took it easy and went for a 30 minute ride. On the second day I woke up feeling better. I had a healthy breakfast and decided to go on another ride. During the second ride I thought that I should do this once a day for each day that I'm sober as it kept me away from drinking and I have a lot of physical exercise to catch up on. On the third day I came to the realization that you're reading now. This day is today. This realization has lifted such a heavy weight from me and I feel so much better and at ease and stronger to tackle this thing now that I realise this. 

I am aware that there is a LOT more to unpack in regards to my childhood and family relationships. But for now just knowing why I turn to the bottle and helping myself let go of the past is what I need to fight another day and to be stronger in doing so. 

I hope this may relate to somebody elses addiction towards alcohol and why they turn towards the bottle. Thank you for reading. IWNDWYT.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.59271073}"
2021-04-04 11:09:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mjy00q/alzheimers_risk_just_another_reason/,Alzheimer's Risk - Just Another Reason,"I grew up with undiagnosed ADD so I've always struggled with forgetfulness and distractibility. However, as I grew up I watched my maternal grandmother fade away due to Alzheimer's Disease and recently I found out my aunt (mom's sister) is suffering from early onset dementia (she's only in her early 60s). Mom herself is bipolar so clearly mental health is a concern here for me.

I'm 37 now and dementia/Alzheimer's is a *major* fear for me the older I get. I started to look at contributing factors (besides genetics). Interestingly, heart health is a huge one that I didn't expect (but makes sense since the heart supplies blood to the brain).  

However, one that really stuck out to me was excessive alcohol consumption. Of course it makes sense that heavy alcohol use has neurological implications but another contributing factor listed was depression. Alcohol being a depressant, this seems like a double whammy.  Alcohol then is perhaps a significant and fairly simple factor that one can take out of the equation. I'm not suggesting that quitting alcohol is easy, but when you compare it to genetics or something like diabetes or high blood pressure/cholesterol, it's a fairly straightforward and immediate change one can make.

So it's not like any of us who find ourselves here need another reason to avoid alcohol, but it certainly doesn't hurt. I know it doubled my resolve today.  Be well and stay sharp my friends.  IWNDWYT. 💛",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4827745}"

And yes stopping drinking, at the very least, meant we were no longer committing as many felonies, not waking up in bed with strangers, not quite so likely to be fired for what we did yesterday... and were more likely to have the rent on the first, to know the name of the person in our bed,  and have that job to go to.  

BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

Recovery gives us a stable platform to work on the things we were trying to medicate or numb, to change into the person we would like to be.  Recovery gives us the opportunity to join a huge community of fellow addicts, alcoholics and general fuckups  who are turning their lives around and often are revealing themselves to be remarkable people.  And once in a while we are able to form a wonderful and lasting connection with them....

Long term recovery gave me the gift of friendship with a man who I watched grow and learn for the past twenty five years or so.  I helped him, he helped me, I watched him help many others and in doing so gain a sense of confidence, and a peace within himself that was such a change and which made his life (which was still difficult) much easier.  It allowed him to die sober and with dignity and the affection of a very large group of people.

No nice moment arrived, last time i had alcohol was last Wednesday, and that was a horrowing experience.

I have tried moderating my drinking before, longest beeing 3 months sober. And i think best quote to describe success of such approach is from Warhammer 40k lore i was recently reading : ""I attempted to exterminate one of their ramshackle armies before, and consider it my greatest lapse in judgement. Since then, whenever I encounter their green taint upon a world, I simply destroy the planet. Horken ""Irontongue"" Paal, Ordo Xenos Inquisitor.

I have problems with depression and i am being treated for it. And i used alcohol as a sort of easy crutch. But it had made everything worse, and after a year of steady progress, i have been considerably worse for the last month. It might not be the only cause, but it definitely makes everything unnecessarily harder.

I am still trying to understand my issues here - I feel like my drinking came from being social, but then throwing up because I decided to “keep up” with others vs. stay centered in my limits. 

There was one particular incident with “friends” where I was throwing up in a bathroom and a friend that I felt safe with in the past took advantage of me while I was throwing up. It broke my heart. you’d think it makes sense to stop drinking after that right? Or become more scared if it? I feel like my habits got worse, and I started dating my now boyfriend and used binge drinking as a way to lash out the anger I wasn’t allowing myself to feel. 

I feel like I am getting better in feeling my anger, but, I still binge drink frequently. Sometimes I can stop, and sometimes I can’t, and when I feel like I can’t, I completely give up and say fuck it. I feel like a part of me is trying to be unsafe to see if I can trust myself or those around me, which is so backwards ha. Not in AA, but have started going to therapy.

It sounds like others have experienced assaults / way traumatic events while drinking. I am worried I’m going to lose my partner over this.

1. Accepting I am a lifelong addict/Background - I recently realized I had alcoholism and in general had an addictive personality. I quit my job and in the time off I watched my addiction manifest itself in everything such as overeating, smoking. video games, drinking for 10 hours straight basically every aspect of my life. Previously I was a workaholic, what filled the void was terrifying.  

2. Quitting and fixing core issue of mental health - I am at the point where I am trying to stop the alcoholic behavior but realize that my ADHD is the underlying reason that makes it so hard for me to have the impulse control. I have quit before for months but lose a handle on it. I just learned that ADHD can make people susceptible to addiction.   
Is anyone dealing with this and what is their approach with trying to tackle what might be the core problem? I fear relapse is imminent unless I come up with a system to manage my ADHD effectively and deal with the trauma in my life that leads to my addiction.  
 
3. Healing -  My brain and my job are the most important things to me. After 30 or so nights drinking all night through the night and sometimes doing other random drugs at bars from strangers I have come to notice I did some serious damage to my brain. I can still function but one night I literally almost went blind for 40 minutes. Luckily it came back but its obvious I need to heal. What are your approaches to this? Are you doing anything to help heal the damage we have likely done to our brain? I am taking multivitamin, fish oil, and exercising. Has anyone here ever looked into Hyperbaric treatment? This guy seems to think it can help with mental health. Has anyone looked into this?

He also has a very loud truck and every morning I hear it fire up and drive off at 5:55am only to return about 10 minutes later. My husband was baffled by this behavior, but I know exactly what he's doing. Our state doesn't allow alcohol to be sold in stores from 11pm-6am. He is going out to re-up on booze the moment the stores open. My husband couldn't believe it, but I know that feeling all too well. I know when every liquor store opens, when every gas station allows alcohol sales and when every bar opens up in town. I speak the same language as any other alcoholic. 

Hearing that truck fire up each morning is a reminder of the hell and insanity my life used to be when alcohol ruled over me. Sometimes it can be easy to romanticize the alcohol after you have been sober for a while, but that early morning booze run is a daily reminder for me. I wake up grateful not to be hungover and grateful that I can do whatever I want with my day because I rule my life now, not booze.

It’s only natural to assume that a change in lifestyle, will alter the way you walk, talk, dress and etc. Everyone has a picture in their head of what they think “clean"" living looks like.

This morning my wife told me I was awake in the night trying to make fresh whipped cream and that I could barely finish a sentence. She said I told her I drank 3/4 of fifth bottle of Vodka. I then proceeded to break down crying telling her I wanted to die to end my drinking. When she asked about my kids, I said they would be better off without me! I have NEVER felt that way, even when I had been drunk. The worst part is I have ZERO recollection! I am so scared! I can’t believe how far I’ve fallen. It has shook me to the core.

I had dinner at a friend's and another friend ended up drinking too much. It's a pretty common occurrence and she often drives while tipsy or after sleeping a few hours if especially drunk. Tonight, however it was clear she shouldn't be driving. Me and my husband offered to drive her home. She was reluctant but eventually agreed. Until we got to the cars and she got in hers and put on the seat belt. 

I tried to get her out, be firm but nice about it, but she went on the defensive. I did try but felt like she'd backed into a corner and the only way to stop her was to physically fight her, and I caved. I shouldn't have, I feel like there was some other form of words I could have put together to get her to change her mind, but I didn't know them. I wanted the whole thing to end. And we left. I didn't know what else to do. 

Then I got a text from the friend (who is very pregnant) who's house we left. I said we'd tried, but failed. We turned around anyway and they were all out in the yard. They had quickly decided to just drive the drunk friend home in her own car. Why couldn't I have figured out a better way instead of caving?  

My husband ended up driving her in her car while I followed so everyone ended up safe in the end. Honestly, I am feeling incredibly guilty that I didn't feel more guilty. I should have known what the right thing was, but I washed my hands of a difficult situation using logic I used to hate. It will probably be ok. Shes driven after drinking before. I don't want to make her even more mad.

I’m sober and today’s dull headache has subsided. The headaches remind me of quitting coffee and quitting smoking. My mind is lingering over the concept of addiction. I’ve read comments comparing quitting alcohol to quitting smoking and it seems like a totally different process for me. For example, I deliberately kept a wrapped pack of cigs in the house. I forced myself to refuse the compulsion and that wrapped pack became a trophy which I threw out when I moved out years later. That trophy became a relic but I always knew it was there. In contrast, I do not keep any wine or whiskey in the house, just some vermouth for cooking. I won’t drink vermouth, it’s gross, I doubt I could swallow it. Everybody has their quirks, their control mechanisms, their “lines“ they won’t cross or red flags when they cross them. Developing a set of skills to defeat addiction is highly personal. I’ve never taken the time to analyze how I set up boundaries for myself. I’m clearly ok refusing addictive substances by characterization: the cig pack is “wrapped”, vermouth is something I never drank but use for cooking because it lasts longer than white wine and it’s not, um, wine. It sounds rudimentary but it‘s key to understanding the mental distinctions that I use without really noticing. What is shows me is that if I set up a mental construct about an addictive substance, I will avoid it. That will form a habit, the habit will become routine, the routine steers me away because it’s a past decision. For alcohol, I am in the ‘barely formed a habit’ stage, which IMO takes longer than 21 days. Smoking was easy to abstain from in a group, people go outside to smoke or congregate in a a group away from non smokers. Drinking feels a lot trickier, I’ve stayed home to avoid alcohol but that can’t last forever. Time to really work out how I will be sober in a world full of drinkers.

I called my partner from the bathroom to talk out my feelings, then went and ordered a mocktail. Ate lots of tacos, then some ice cream, and took the train back home.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I’m going to start this by saying how humbled & honored I am to be hosting this week. I’ve thought about it for quite awhile. So, thanks for putting up with me this week!

Today is Easter, and regardless of your religious affiliations (or lack thereof), seasonal change is a time of renewal. If nothing else, what’s not to love about a chocolate bunny or two! ;) So I am going to take today to reflect on a few thoughts of renewal, and encourage you all to do the same if you’d like to share a bit. 

First of all, we each wake up every day with a chance to write our script for the day. I mean ... not the whole thing. I haven’t yet managed to write the winning lottery numbers into my daily script, sadly. But raise your hand if you’ve woken up and thought “nope, not drinking today” and had that resolve crumble by mid-afternoon. (That’s me you see raising all the hands over here.) But the beautiful thing is, you get to try again, and again, until something clicks. In the spirit of hope and renewal, I’m going to ask that each of you struggling with getting through the day just say “today I have the power to rewrite the script.” Don’t look at anything beyond today, but embrace the fact that you can toss the beer out of the fridge, drive home a different way that doesn’t take you past the bar or liquor store, or just go to bed at 7pm and call it good. There is immeasurable power in proving to yourself that you have the power to make things different. If it feels like too big of a hurdle — well, that’s what we’re here for! Post below and say it feels really hard today, and let everyone here encourage you with their experiences of how they’ve managed to change things a day at a time. 

Another thing I want to share about renewal involves my relationships with my family, and especially my son. It was **so hard** to see or really acknowledge to myself how much damage I was doing. My son used to call me out most nights of the week and say, “oh, you’re in your phase.”  Wow, was that hard to hear. And for the the first 3-4 weeks I was consistently sober, I kept hearing it from him. But he was expecting that behavior, and I can’t blame him. But I’m here to say, that relationship has done a 160* (he’s in middle school, expecting a 180* seems overly optimistic LOL), and the only times he has said “you’re in your phase” over the past 4 months or so are when I’ve had a rough day and am preoccupied with work or something else. And it’s said in a completely different tone ... he clearly recognizes that it’s not the same thing. I remember being worried that I would be trying to overcome that with him for years, but the fact is, it works faster than that. That is absolutely cause for hope and encouragement!

Finally, my job performance and satisfaction have improved beyond all measure. I never expected it, but it’s been amazing. 

So ... wherever you are in this journey, what signs of hope and renewal in your life have you seen? Big or small, they are all important and help us encourage each other. ❤️",128,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5414566}"

So though there are some injuries holding me back, one thing I have in abundance right now is time so I'm trying some new things and revisiting old ones.  I've taken more walks, gotten higher step counts, and tried more new things this past week then I had in several months, in fact, though my program is falling well short of our current culture's preferred mode, which is of course ""beast"". 

Last week I set a goal to do an additional dance a day plus one full yoga workout. Well, I did the yoga and I did a dance (only) one day. Partial success. I also tried Body Attack on Les Mills on Demand and got my ass absolutely handed to me. So I see here a new challenge! And one which, if mastered, would certainly enhance the beastliness of my mode! It's an 11 track workout so today I tried again only doing the first 2 and last 2 songs. This week's goal: again the yoga and the one dance a day and at least once to do 5 of 11 tracks in Body Attack. I feel OK with an ambitious goal like that right now. I have the time, after all.

So how's YOUR fitness going so far in the spring? Hitting PRs and want to brag? Can't get unvelcroed from your couch and want to commiserate? Let your SD fam hear about it here. And happy, unhungover, well-hydrated exercising!

**We need a host for this thread for spring! If you have 30 days or more sober and want to help out your community, we'd love for you to volunteer. Let me know in comments or you can PM me. Sobriety is required. Beast mode is optional.**",27,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.6610215}"

I live alone. I used to drink sometimes on my own but that's always been pretty easy not to do if I just decide not to. Harder is when going out with friends but Covid had put a stop to that. Also hard is visiting family, doing some hard work during the day with them and then feeling like a cocktail with them in the evening.

Today that's what happened. I felt the urge come on before it was even time. I knew I 'd be faced with this choice, this temptation. And I wanted to have a drink.

Later. ""Okay, I can have cocktails, a bunch even. It's Saturday. I have no where to be tonight or tomorrow. That's not a lie. That's the truth."" -- r/stopdrinking voices said, ""Play it forward. Forget the counter, what happens TONIGHT if you do that?""  Me, ""Well, yeah. I feel good for drinks #1 and #2. Then I am concentrated only on when I can make another one without it seeming like I'm having too much. Then I will be counting down the minutes until everyone leaves and I can go out to smoke. But a smoke needs a drink. So I'll make some just to have by myself. Then it will be an hour later, I'll be alone, kinda sad, and even though I don't text people anymore I'll just be pathetic. And tomorrow I'll feel horrible about myself. Are those two drinks worth it?""  Also me, ""No, probably not.""  


I didn't drink. It was fine. Took about 15 minutes of strength and then I didn't even want a drink. Didn't crave one. And looking at some around me, was glad I wasn't quite like them. (Nothing wrong with them, all beautiful people. Just not how I wanted to be.)

I started drinking when I was 12 years old (55 now) and my parents were drinkers, maybe not alcoholics, but alcohol was a big part of my life growing up, smoking also.

I don't blame them or anyone, or any particular event, history or even one defining reason. maybe it's a genetic flaw, maybe I'm predisposed to addiction.

I found alcohol to be helpful for anxiety, stress and reward. I found it always initially helped when I had a rough day or was worried or when things were going great, a way to celebrate.

I never, ever could just have one or a few, I'd have to have them all until I passed out. To be honest i loved the initial rush that alcohol brings, like any drug, but it never ends well for me.

I suppose there probably isn't really one defining reason, but I find it helpful to drill down in to the why of it all and in doing that may be it's helpful to see the triggers and plan for the challenges that lay ahead. I'm 43 days in, PB is 48, trying for 60, but I can feel the cravings coming back, the feeling that I will one day be able to control the monster it is.....knowing that's always a lie.

Today marks my 2 year sober anniversary. I’m 29 years old in a few weeks. Unfortunately unlike most others with this amount of time under there belt my life has not gotten much better. 

I will pre-face this with saying that without a doubt I feel more healthy and I do better work at my job. Those have both been positives and I am grateful for those things. 

My issue is that from the social/fun aspect of life I have lost nearly everything. I have lost touch with a majority of my friends as most of time when my friends have get togethers drinking is involved. I can be around drinking it just isn’t fun being the only one sober, it’s a chore having to go to those events. Dating  has also been a wreck for me, it’s so difficult dating and having to bring up what a fuck up I am and that I’m a sober every time I get asked to meet for drinks. 

I just feel like my brain is permanently damaged and I am unable to have fun doing normal activities. My brain was trained for so long to associate alcohol to my hobbies that it will never be the same for me. I don’t remember the last time I’ve actually looked forward to something. I don’t understand others who are able to go through sobriety looking forward to very simple things, it just doesn’t seem worth it to me.

I don’t want to settle in life for being an outcast and not being able to be a normal person. I’ve tried meds but they just make me feel numbness and I have been seeing a therapist for the past month to try and help myself. I’m starting to give up on therapy though as it’s came to the realization that my problem isn’t temporary, I can’t be fixed, I will have this disease until the day I die. I understand that I was dealt a crappy hand in life and that life isn’t fair. I just don’t want to have to deal with this for the next 50 years of my life, I would rather die.

The trouble for me comes when my wife is at work and I am left to my own vices. Last weekend was a real test for me and I successfully didn’t drink the entire weekend even when she wasn’t at home and she was at work. I work twelves and in medical so I have lots of stress from just work, death, and just other things. Last Friday when I knew my wife was working I convinced myself that I was going to not drink but my body didn’t exactly follow that plan. I went into the store and bought a bottle of Johnny walker black label. And I hid it of course so I could drink when she was gone and I would hopefully be sober when she came home. All she would say is that she was really dissapointed in me and that hurts but it doesn’t stop me from doing it. So fast forward to that night. I could have drank but i didn’t. I still have the bottle hidden. Now that I’m 19 days in I can say that I feel better, I like waking up without a hangover and not going into work hungover and have that impending sense of doom around me. Like what if I go into work and it’s crazy and I got to take care of patients that are in need of serious medical help and I’m still drunk from last night? I dread that feeling and thankfully it hasn’t happened. The reason I bring this up is because I thought my wife was working tomorrow(sun) but instead works Monday so that leaves me free to drink all Monday night. I’m scared I’m going to relapse on Monday night even though i consciously don’t want to drink. My body during those times just wants it and does it. What should I do? Throw away the bottle? I can go get more. Or try to get through the night with the bottle there? Any input would be appreciated.",35,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49600065}"

In one of the bazillion books I’ve read on alcoholism one of them mentioned that things alcohol had made you become would fall away in time as you are sober and it can be an eye opener when it happens. In my case at about 4 weeks in, that is no joke, it fell away and crushed me emotionally with its falling.

I was at work, totally content and out of nowhere an aspect of the selfish, self serving, hardly recognizing the needs of others, alcoholic me fell away and all the wrongs emotionally, financially, and all other aspects of what my wife has been through all this time became crystalline clear to ME, not that other alcohol induced self serving asshole me who was so blissfully unaware of the carnage I caused. I nearly collapsed in grief, literally. I had to make my way to a bathroom stall to stifle the weeping of regret that crushed me. Once I had my act together some 10 minutes later I went back to work and though I could function my mind was entirely focused on self loathing and sorrow. Hard to tell by my posts, but I’m a writer and felt I needed to write all the things I felt and my apologies for the countless wrongs done her (no doubt I’ve forgotten but a fraction of them given the memory retention properties of alcohol).

Wanting to write it and give it to her was more so that I would remember to acknowledge all the things specifically of her suffering, hardship, and sacrifice through them all, not for the ability to wordsmith it into something more palatable. I realized though, if I could just keep from weeping all the way through that I needed to say it face to face to her, to apologize in person. I did. I won’t wander off on a tangent of that discussion but to sum it up with Easter and all, those single footprints in the sand were her’s, carrying me. Being Christian I don’t deny His doing it, but it was the best analogy I had for her. 24 years ladies and gents, 24 years she waited and held on for me to finally get my shit together. I have never known a more wonderful human than her. Who would do that, right? Well she did, and I am forever in her debt and forever grateful.

For those of you with significant others that stayed the course despite you trying your damndest to  wreck the ship, let them know that YOU know the sacrifice they made for you. Without them you would likely not be here. Let them know, and let yourself never forget. You had the incredible courage to stop drinking, but they had even more courage to stay with you before you did.

I turned 29 in March and decided I was gonna use the last year of my 20s in a good way. I'm 11 days sober from alcohol, pill abuse, and Facebook/Instagram. I used all of these things for a similar end: escapism and addiction. Looking for validation from outside sources, be it likes or a substance to get me drunk or high, or other people. But I have decided to be over all of that now and if I decided to and keep strong in my sobriety, I will be. 

My older brother is here visiting us. Everybody in my nuclear family has a complicated relationship because our parents were very abusive toward us kids, and my father to my mother. It's one of the many reasons I slid so easily into substance addiction starting at age 17. 

Anyhow, my brother is here visiting me now. And I'm glad to be a sober sister! He got drunk in Texas a week ago on Sunday night and I was calling him trying to get him to bed for his first day of work in Texas. He didn't listen to me, but I did my best. He ended up falling asleep in his car at the bar (thank god he didn't drive) and being late to work, vomiting on the way, had  to have a talk with his boss. He doesn't drink or socialize regularly, and somebody got him drinking down in Texas and put him on their tab.....so he got wasted. 

Anyhow, it was very scary for both of us. I was worried about him and he could've gotten into an accident or hurt someone while driving or lost his job or gotten alcohol poisoning. He seems to have learned from that incident, had a talk with his boss.  

I couldn't prevent it but I was glad I was sober at my home calling him and trying to get him to go to bed. If I had been drinking, I would've been a hypocrite telling him to stop or checked out of checking on him. 

So it's moments like that encouraging me to keep sober. And being able to talk on the phone sober to people, not worried if they knew or were judging me for drinking. 

Today's kind of difficult, not in a craving way, just because I didn't get tons of sleep last night. I'm on hold with the bank just trying to get my expired debit card replaced. It was estimated to be an hour long wait and it's been 43 minutes now. Just feel tired and crabby and a little frustrated. But I'm not gonna drink! I'm gonna rest up and have a beautiful week!

I've been drinking heavily since I moved into my own apartment when I was 23 (29 now), although I know I've had a problem since first stealing liquor from my parents when I was 16. For the first few years of getting fucked up daily I could get up the next morning and go to work, but drinking now, to the level that I need to, basically guarantees the next day will be spent in bed. Before things shut down last March, I was limiting the drinking to weekends (which is still bad but at least an improvement from before), but when we all got sent home it became so much more difficult. My job is generally self directed long term projects, with few meetings, so there was no barrier to drinking basically any day of the week, and I could start earlier and earlier. 

I've been lurking here for about a year, usually getting to 3-5 days before drinking again and then telling myself *this time* I was really going to stop, and repeat. Well it seems to have slightly clicked this time around, since this is the longest I've gone without drinking, in a situation in which I could, in probably 6 years. Sitting here on my second cup of coffee it's easy to say I'll keep it up. At least for me, the idea of staying sober always seems so easy for the first few hours after waking up clear headed (the coffee could have something to do with that), but my resolve always weakens as the day goes on. Starting at about 3 pm, my brain will tell me that getting blackout drunk by myself while chain smoking and barely eating dinner is a great idea. Well actually it'll tell me that I can have fun cooking a complex meal or doing some productive tasks while drinking, but I know it's the former situation that would actually happen. 

The idea of never drinking again still terrifies me, even though I know that if I want any semblance of a life, alcohol can't be part of it, but I'm trying not to think about that right now. The idea of wasting another 6 years of my life should be more terrifying. Thinking about how much I've given up by spending my 20s in a drunken hole makes me want to cry.

fast forward a few months and we started fighting often. because i had to move back home too due to covid, i couldn't exactly drink casually because it was just not really accepted in my family. 

so every time we would be in a fight, which was often, i would take my car (and i do not condone this at all) and drive around aimlessly for hours while binging on wine. they were always on nice sunny days and during these rides we would usually text each other trying to work it out. it was comforting. i did this every few weeks from june or july until about october.

it's starting to get nice and sunny out again and doing that is like reliving old memories and i guess subconsciously makes me feel like we're still together. i know i need to move on because we were just not right for each other and we never will be, but there was something about those rides.

Went for a walk on the coast and on the way home found that there's a zero% version of one of my favourite ales.

Now sat in the garden watching  the sun go down with a pint and I'm not missing the alcohol at all.

2021-04-03 12:47:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mjc7mj/6_months_again/,6 Months Again,"I’m happy that I’ve hit six months again. This marks the longest amount of time I’ve put into not drinking by simply not drinking over the last 5 years or so. In 2016, I went about 6 months without drinking as well but crashed and burned at my father-in-law’s wedding. I mean, I relapsed and struggled to get back into being sober again. 

I’m challenged that I’ve hit six months again. As I’ve been sobering up, I’ve been confronting a lot of things I’d been burying with alcohol. Grief, depression, anxiety, health issues, etc. Undoubtedly, some of this suffering was the result of drinking, but I think much more of it was just life and now that I’ve not only stopped drinking but have been actively digging up dead bodies... I mean problems, with my clearer head, it’s caused a lot of discomfort. Not to say that I’m not seeing improvements, I am. But I’m also having to work. Hard. 

Getting my depression meds tuned in has been tough. Now that I feel like I might be in a good place with that, I’ve noticed I’ve been losing weight and can’t eat without severe stomach pain. This is a path divergence for drinking me: when drinking, I’d just lean into this suffering and drink more until I could eat. Sober me is working with doctors and other experts to find the cause. That said, the constant state of fatigue and sadness is trying for me, as well as my partner and for sure my kids. I’m not a fun person to be around a lot and don’t have much energy to do stuff. 

AND YET. I do not want to go back to drinking. Perhaps being drunk or hungover is an easier reason for your loved ones as to why you don’t want to or can’t do things, but it’s not a good reason. It’s clearly selfish. While I am not drinking for me first, I think the connections to how it benefits those around me are easier to see or explain. Perhaps that part about getting help is the key idea here. Because I am sober, I am looking to improve and putting the effort behind it. I wanted to say, “Even if I can be a pain to be around when I’m sober,” but I KNOW I am a pain to be around when drunk/hungover. 

Six months. I am getting better. You can too. Let’s do this together. I will not drink with you today.

It took a scary trip to the hospital to finally drive me to get some serious sobriety. 

After 6 months, I have a lot to reflect on and to look forward to. But the number one thing that I want to share is that no matter how many day ones it takes, keep trying. Every slip or full-blown relapse was a chance to revise my strategy. I am so very grateful that I never stopped trying to stop. Don't go back out, obviously, but if you do, take it from me, don't take it as failure. Take it as a time to figure out why you did it and what you need to put in place to stop it the next time.

I guess I’m lucky that I’m not really experiencing cravings, and that it’s been relatively easy to stop so far.

This is my first weekend I’ve gone away with friends since I stopped drinking.  Both my friends and partner are supportive (and curious in a polite way), about my sobriety.

I was really nervous about this weekend, I knew there would be wine with dinner, maybe a cocktail with board games.  Not that heavy, all weekend bender drinking, but that easy drink you can have with close friends.  The one that sometimes is just one or two to unwind.  (For me, that would usually be one or two very heavy pours of whiskey, or skipping a day time activity to get a head start on drinking and tell myself it was “me,” time.)

I am a big advocate of planning for sobriety, and my plan for this weekend was to treat myself to a few Curious Elixirs or root beers.  I was nervous about being around alcohol but I was also excited for the opportunity to see people drunk or tipsy.  I wanted to see what I was missing from a sober point of view.

Dinner time came, a bottle of red opened, followed by a bottle of white, then two of my friends started drinking whiskey.  I was really shocked by the speed they were drinking.  I was also shocked by how quickly the slurring started or their focus was lost on conversation.  I was really grateful I brought drink options, I just fed my cravings different flavors of non-alcoholic drinks until they went away.

We played some board games, I won every single time.  It was amusing, but I don’t even think I would call it fun.  It felt like playing with toddler at times.  Had I been drunk, I would’ve never noticed this.  I would’ve likely been close to a black out by the time that the board games came out.

The worst part was watching my partner, who is typically kind and brilliant, turn into a muttering mess, with non-sensical clap backs to every comment toward him.  When we went to bed he made a comment about me giving him nasty looks all day, (maybe I did when he was drinking, but definitely didn’t all throughout the day!).  I doubt he will even remember he said that when he wakes up.

The best part, I’ve been awake for hours.  I watched the sunrise, took the dog on a walk, listened to some music, and meditated.  This is the real “me time,” for the real me.  The sober me.  This weekend let me see how I can have fun without alcohol, and that there doesn’t really seem to be anything fun about alcohol from an outsiders perspective.

- I spent the evening drinking calorie heavy sweet drinks that aren't even particularly good, instead of the (really damn good) low calorie juice we had in the fridge, and got fried food for dinner instead of cooking something with the organic fresh produce we have at home.

Sometimes overdoing it on the weekends, blacking out often in those cases, hangovers from hell, etc. 

After a particularly awful night in May 2019, I gave it up for good, rattled by the shame, embarrassment, and anxiety of the event in question. It took something dramatic to shake me into getting it together and quitting-- for an almost 2 year stretch. 

Which leads us to about a week and a half ago, where I decided to test the waters, stomp my foot, and say that at 25 I can ""have a glass of wine now, for God's sake"". Well, that turned into drinking almost every day of that period. Not necessarily getting wasted every time, but enough to let that grey area transform back into a fog hanging over me. Anxiety through the roof, planning what I was going to drink all day, trying to bargain with myself, the usual. 

Got more drunk than I had in the whole ""relapse"" last night, but instead of reaching that euphoric state I thought I remembered, I just couldn't. Felt sick and anxious, picking at my skin (compulsive anxiety habit) with racing thoughts and feeling ashamed, embarrassed, out of place, not me anymore. Trapped. Freaking out internally and chugging water in the hopes of beating a hangover.

Another Redditor posted about how getting sober is like our second chance at life, and how we should make each day count. This resonated with me on a pretty deep level so thank you whoever you are! I deffo failed in my last one so yes, it is nice to be have a second crack at the whip! 

I'm still doing the 30 day alcohol experiment which is going well and also started reading a book called Daily Meditations on Letting Go: The Language of Co-dependancy. It's very good! Has a short cheaper for each day of the year. 

Today's chapter was on asking whether I am accepting what life and my situation is presenting to me today. 

I've been practising stopping when I am stressed or uncomfortable and praying to God to give me the strength to best cope with whatever difficulty I am faced with, rather than turning to alcohol (or food) to deal with it. 

I'm finding that even though this can be uncomfortable, feeling pass pretty quickly and I am then left with the space to work out what I would like to do in response to whatever has disturbed me. 

I've also been getting my 'high' naturally by exercising. There's a lady called Sydney Cummings who shares daily hiit workouts on youtube. She proper cheers me up! Here's a link for one if anyone fancies: https://youtu.be/MaJKfBb0j6w

Keeping a daily journal on where I'm up to and what's going on in my head is very helpful. It's also a great new way for me to pass the time now that I'm not wasted. It's something that I always used to do in my pre- drinking days... Which was a very longtime ago! 

Anyhoo, that's enough waffling for now. Hope someone gets a bit of something from what I've shared. 


I hope everyone has a sober and happy day. Stay safe 🙏♥️

Another attempt to quit, with my husband at his absolute end with me; fights, hospital emergency department visit and all, police called the night before because of my idiotic loud drunken rage, all just exactly the kinds of positive interactions you hope for in your life, there by the end. 

Six months ago today I decided this was it or I’d leave him and let him find a real, functional partner. I got a counselor, which I think is helping me. I go to SMART and AA meetings and am a horrible journal keeper but I do enjoy reading them back through and seeing progress. 

Most importantly, I acknowledged fully that there was no hope of me losing this obsession with booze while I was still drinking it. Just like when I quit smoking I just had to stop gazing longingly at it and see it for what it was in my life. Like a big wet heavy putrid backpack I was choosing to pick up from my bedroom floor every morning and haul with me throughout my day and through all my interactions with others, and there with my private thoughts, shaming myself all day over what I did last night. 

Then next step was to somehow find some unconditional acceptance for myself. Highly recommend SMART on this one. It worked for me when nothing else seemed to. After that, starting to really appreciate the small early differences like my heart rate being 10 BPM *at least* lower than before, which just think about how that affects your anxiety through the day.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It’s the beginning of Saturday and it’s with a heavy heart that I will say my goodbyes to you today as host of this past weeks DCI.

I’ve seen you laugh and you’ve made me smile.  I’ve seen you cry and I’ve wept along with you.  I’ve felt your hurt and your anger and I myself was hurt and angry too.  You shared your spirit with me and my spirit is now yours.  And I will never forget you!!

Yesterday I spoke of success.  I will leave you today with a quote that I keep close to me.  It describes closely to how I feel about life and the constant pursuit to challenge myself and love myself.



My favorite part is in there as you read it.  And I hope and pray that maybe....just maybe one of you may have breathed easier because not only I was here, but WE as a community were here. For each other.

“To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; To know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.”
Ralph Waldo Emerson.  


It’s your turn to strive for success.  It’s been your turn for a while.  Grab it and take it for yourself!!! If you’ve been wanting a better life for yourself then fight for it!!! 

I will not be drinking with you today!!

I want to thank u/sweetmusiccaroline handing over the reigns.  It was an honor to follow your footsteps!!! 

I want to give much love to the always venerable u/sainthomer for allowing me the pleasure of hosting this week.  If you have 30 days or more sober, you should sign up for hosting DCI.  It’s an unforgettable experience!!  You can reach out to u/sainthomer for the details on how to do just that!!

And with that....I’ll say adios mi amigos.  Te amo muchisimo!!

Today, I am 57 days Sober. Wednesday, February 3rd, 2021 is the last day I consumed alcohol of any kind.In the last five years I have stopped and started drinking again at least 10 times. Sometimes just for a day or so, once for almost a week and once, last December, for 21 glorious days. When I started back 
again in December, I remember opening the bottle and placing it on the counter and just looking at it. 

Something was off about it. It did not feel right, but I really wanted to drink. I wanted to prove to myself that I could just have one, or maybe two and then be normal again like a lot of people and their drinking habits. You know the people. It is hot, I just finished the yard, I am just having a nice cold beer. One beer 
later, they are on to the next project and then maybe having a glass of iced tea with their dinner. Not like me. I can never have just one drink. 

In December, after I downed that first beer after 21 days of sobriety, another one came quickly after it, then another, and another. Eventually the beer got tiresome, or filling and I switched to brown liquor, this is when things amped up. My pours are never small, usually 4 fingers, the good stuff, with the special ice cubes from the side of the freezer that are larger, also a nice glass. It is a ritualistic process until it is not, then it just a shit show. That is when I begin to forget, to enter that phase of euphoria slash drunkenness that is supposedly what I am chasing. I have rarely been accused of being an angry drunk, but I am very forgetful when I drink and can be very clumsy. I often drink until I pass out. The last 
hours of my evening slash early morning either a blur or completely forgotten. Waking up in a fog, slogging through another day until 5 pm. Rinse, repeat.

I had reached a point in my drinking career where my shopping cart most often had more than a hundred dollars’ worth of alcohol each week, not counting trips to the liquor store. Every day was a drinking day. Covid had given me an excuse to start drinking on workdays almost exactly at 5 pm and well into each evening and start most weekends around 11 am because it was “5 o’clock somewhere”. I 
have never had a DUI, never directly lost anything important (more on this later) and only one close friend had talked to me about slowing down. I was winning the game, lol. Great wife, great kids, great dog, great house, great job, great everything. So, why the hell was I drinking so much?

Most of my life has been surrounded by drugs and alcohol in some way shape or form. My parents were heavy drinkers when I was growing up. I remember going to their friends house every weekend when Iwas probably 5 years old until I was 10 or so. There they would play cards and eat and drink till the wee hours, my sister and I crashing on the floor or couch. I suppose I should be happy that they, in the 1970’s, chose not to drink and drive but rather drink and sleep at their friends house. I am not saying those were bad times, they were not, we had fun, but it set the stage for what would be a lifetime of drinking for me.

As a teenager my parents worked extremely hard, and we did not have a whole lot until I was probably 14 or 15 years old. No disrespect at all but it did give both me and my sister a lot of alone time which led to all sorts of mischief and mayhem. Most days my parents were out the door at 7 am and not returning until 6 pm or so. My Dad most weeks was on the road a salesman which left my Mom to take care of us until he got home. Truly little supervision allowed us to get into situations we probably had no business in. Drinking and obtaining alcohol was easy. My parents were still drinking and did not really pay attention to their own stash and my sister was 2 years older than me. She hung out with seniors and could easily obtain beer and wine as the legal age was 18. She was even grandfathered in when the law went to 21 so my supply was always ample. Pint sized bottles were a staple. I once took alcohol to 
middle school and it was in my locker. I do not know why but I was showing it off and actually got busted for it. Yes, I was punished by my parents, but my drinking only intensified after that.

High school years were a haze of poor grades, much alcohol consumption and plenty of weed smoking and some dabbling in the harder stuff but I mostly stayed with booze and weed. My sister took a turn for the worse and started getting into the harder drugs with her friends. We started to drift apart at that 
point. There were moves along the way and I guess part of me wanted to fit in so drinking was an easy way to do that. If I could provide it, people seemed to like me, so I did. I managed to squeak into college, but dear god did I go full stupid when I got there. I hardly ever went to class and drank myself into 
oblivion almost every single day. It is amazing to me that I did not somehow die during those times.

Fast forward. I was kicked out of college for bad grades. I came home and worked and drank some more. Managed to get back into college and then was doing ok but found out my girlfriend was pregnant and used it as an excuse to leave college, go back home and marry her. Found a low-end job in the IT industry just to get my foot in the door so at least I did that right. I drank most evenings and weekends but still managed to be a good father to my kids, but I was not a particularly good husband. The marriage did not last but we had two kids together who were and continue to be lights in my life.I am not sure how much exactly drinking led to my first marriage ending but I am sure it played some 
part. Once that marriage ended, I drifted for a bit but finally sound someone that made sense to me, someone that made me want to be better. That relationship was based largely on partying and drinking but we were having fun. Sure, we were getting hammered on a regular basis but we both held down good jobs and I had my kids every other weekend. It gave us lots of time to be a couple and a good amount of time to be parents to the kids. We balanced very well. 

About 15 years ago we had a child together. There was a big gap between our new child and the two older kids but deciding to have a child together was an amazing decision. We were not going out and partying as much, but we were still staying home and partying either by ourselves or with friends. My wife has largely been successful at drinking in moderation, she drinks a lot less now that I have stopped drinking, that is for sure!
I have been to exactly one AA meeting for myself, it was not my cup of tea. I created this account a little over 6 years ago. It was primarily to talk about money issues and all the debt I was in while being as anonymous as I could be. I looked back at my history and 3 years ago I found this sub. I was drinking hard the night before, had snuck outside for a smoke and fallen down the driveway busting myself and my glasses up. It was embarrassing but I laughed it off. Looks like my ‘sobriety’ lasted about 5 days on that occasion. There are several more attempts over the last 3 years all lasting ridiculously small periods of time. So, what is different this time? How have I managed to go 57 days in this attempt?

I started a new job in January of this year. Through an unfortunate event that is not drinking related, I was laid off from my last job in December. I put a lot of effort into finding this job and it was not easy to obtain. I feel as if this is an amazing opportunity for me and my family. I am 51 years old and would like to have a reasonable chance at retiring when I am 65 years old. That gives me 14 years to make up a lot of time and money wasted. Drinking seems counterintuitive to those goals. When I started this job, I was still drinking every single day and waking up in that fog and trying to learn all the new technology was difficult and very frustrating. I found myself forgetting things and having to ask people to repeat themselves often which I knew was not good for a new employee to do. Our child, the last one at home, is now 15 years old and driving and playing high school football. The last thing I want to do is embarrass him or set him on the wrong path regarding alcohol and its use. My health is not fantastic, I am overweight and have back issues and other problems which alcohol can only make worse and exasperate. I love my wife dearly and want to spend the rest of my life with her and be a beacon and a rock for her. I cannot be those things while drinking alcohol. 

For these reasons and more I choose to not drink today. I do not know about tomorrow because it is not here yet and I cannot worry about it. Today I will not drink. Today I will be a productive person. Today I will be the best husband I can be. Today I will be the best father I can be. Alcohol thwarts plans, alcohol lies, alcohol kills feelings, alcohol destroys relationships, it fails health. 57 days is not an eternity. Most days now I do not think about drinking although there are still many triggers that do make me aware of it. The world is place where alcohol and drinking are commonplace, I choose not to be a part of that. And just because I choose not to be a part of that does not make me different or bad it just makes me, me. Thank you all for being here for me and for each other, this place is truly a gift for those seeking to change their relationship with alcohol.

To give a bit more context, I work at a restaurant. With today being Good Friday, we had a seafood feature menu going on and my manager decided to make a competition about who could sell the most from that menu. The managers also had a small bet about who would sell the most and my manager informed me that she had picked me as the most likely to win, which made me feel proud and also made me really want to try hard. I am also a competitive person in general, so regardless of not really desiring the prize, I was trying my hardest to win the competition.

I didn't end up winning the competition, but I came in second place. The runner up received a bottle of Riesling. I knew that I didn't want to drink it, but I was concerned that rejecting the bottle might make me come across as rude. So I accepted it and found myself kind of hemming and hawing about what to do with it. Most of me knew that I didn't want to drink it but there was a part of me that felt like I had earned it because I had done well in the competition.

But in reality, rewarding myself with the bottle of wine would have been a punishment in the long run. Things are going great for me right now and there's no reason to veer from the course I have set for myself. 

In the end, I decided to give it to my roommate. She has a much healthier relationship with alcohol than I do, and she ended up really appreciating the gesture.

The one thing that was really nice about the whole thing, is that even though I came into possession of a bottle of fancy wine, it wasn't very hard for me to pass on it. The same excuses that would have worked on my brain a few weeks ago aren't nearly as effective, and that feels good.

Safe to say, I don't miss a F'INg thing.","Can't say that this past year has been easy because it's been extraordinarily isolating. But the gift in that is I've gotten to know myself, enjoy my own company, and don't resort to many of my old coping mechanisms, ahem, drinking.

But, I haven't been put in many situations to test the hypothesis of not wanting to drink in my old environments, but today I had that chance.

Long story short, I had a 5-star hotel room booked for someone who didn't end up visiting, couldn't get a refund, so I thought, what the hell, staycation. Might as well check it out, even though I wasn't entirely looking forward to it, but it would be a nice break from living within 20 feet of my desk 24 hours a day.

In the past, I loved these super posh and upscale environments. I looooooved getting all dressed up to get blackout drunk 2 hours later. Hell, I've been wasted plenty of times in the hotel bar, somehow believing that spending $30 on a glass of wine was offering me something.

It doesn't.

At check-in, I was offered champagne. In the past, I would've probably thought, ""WOW, HOW AWESOME"". Instead, I thought, how sad.

Got up to the room, and of course, it's tiny like a prison cell. And even better, the window faced another high rise, so no view. But loaded with booze. And a sex kit. That would be the only way staying there would've been tolerable.

I just thought to myself, what's the point?

The lobby was extremely loud; my doggo, who is used to hanging out with me and my tranquil life, was terrified.

Strangers were loudly running up, ""CAN I PET YOUR DOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Dude, no, you're freaking him the F out. And you're 100% freaking me out, and my CPTSD is terrible enough.

I was there for a few hours and came back home.

I saw nothing of value there. People were hammered before the clock even hit double digits tonight, and I have zero desire to be around loud, obnoxious drunk people making very loud statements like, ""that dog is terrified."" Well, yeah, dude, I would be too if I had never seen a grown man stumbling around chain-smoking and slurring trying to touch my head.

What's that whole thing about putting lipstick on a pig?

It never became so clear to me how much denial I was in about the environments I spent time in. What a joke. I didn't feel an ounce of my being wanting to stick around.

So now I'm home, with the doggo, in the same place I've been locked up for a year, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

In the past, I used to suffer from panic attacks being home, and I would go and book hotel rooms 😂 the tables have tuned.

Let's just say the last 6 months have been a roller coaster for me.  In early October of last year I started to feel pretty bad physically and I knew exactly why.  My drinking was really starting to catch up with me and after a brief hospital stay I made the decision to quit.  Well, at that point the damage was done and it was a little too late to prevent the issues that I went through starting later in October.  

In late October I went to the hospital because I felt like I was extremely constipated.  It wasn't too long and the ER doctors started cluing in on my alcoholic history.  Over the next week my body started shutting down completely.  Long story short, I'm now a cirrhosis patient and my drinking had put me into complete kidney failure.  My kidneys were working at 4% at one point and I was on dialysis.  After a few days on dialysis I wasn't responding and I was actually being placed into hospice.  ***Yes,*** ***fucking hospice***.  I would have been a lot more concerned at the time, but I was just laying in a hospital bed hallucinating for days.  

Then I got better.  After they stopped treatment and told my wife to start planning for a funeral, my vitals started improving gradually.  After a few months in the hospital I was eventually released to a physical therapy facility and I spent some time teaching myself to walk and climb a flight of stairs again.  The good news is that everything still continues to improve and now I'm feeling AMAZING right now.  I lost 100+ lbs in the hospital in 3 months and I've kept all of that off (it's not hard when you are not drinking a loaf of bread every few hours).  Now I'm even exercising and I even finished a 4 mile run a week ago.  I'm a FAR CRY from the guy in December who couldn't make it up a flight of steps without taking a few minute-long breaks to catch my breath.

So I figured the 6 month mark is time to share my story here.  For all of you who are struggling I know very very well what you are going through.  But you have to find a way to get out from underneath this disease.  I feel lucky to ""only"" be walking away with cirrhosis, chronic kidney disease, and the prospect of a much shorter lifespan.  The good news is that my numbers currently suggest I don't need a transplant now.  I think I dodged the world's largest bullet for the moment, but my health is still in a very precarious place.  Take my advice, you don't want to fuck around and find out like I did.  End stage liver and kidney failure is a real bad way to go.  The horrible guilt I feel about putting my wife and kids in a place where they were actively preparing a funeral for me is something I'll carry around forever.  But they are very forgiving people and are happy to have the REAL me back.  I'm happy to have that person as well.

There's other stuff going on as well.   Like her letting her fuck up of a cousin stay there, with his girlfriend.   And her not getting her heat fixed,  and I  don't have any other viable options for child care.  Then the soap opera with her on again off again boyfriend that just got kicked out of rehab.

As things start looking a bit more up and there’s a bit of light at the end of the tunnel I find myself reflecting. 

Sadly, instead of lessening my personal insanity and taking better care of my health I took that extra time and lessened social interaction and flipped it into a year of near constant drinking. No good for my body and no good for my brain. Emotionally and mentally it was a huge strain to be isolated and lonely as all get out so why not “solve” it with booze, right? Physically and recreationally things were limited so, why not just sit around and drink? 

So much fear, so many unknowns, so little interaction and virtually no ability to be with the people and do the things I loved. Thusly, I just kept digging a hole with my drinking and it ramped up and up. And now I have (yet again) a whole year of my life just up in drinking flames and virtually nothing to show for it. 

Not to mention the guilt I have for putting myself and others at risk in my ventures to get more and more booze. Add on the guilt I have for not treating my body well when it really needed it. And of course the general guilt and shame of drinking in excess. 

I’ve been lucky enough to get both rounds of my Covid shot now. And what did I do after each one? Got ripped and didn’t take care of myself. Again, when my body really needed it. Here I am, body struggling with building immunity, and I just slapped it upside the face by adding booze (and being hungover to start with). And now I’m terrified that I fucked it up somehow and I won’t have the positive results from the vaccine. 

I had two awesome sober days this week. I was getting back on track. It felt good. And then I just robotically went and started drinking. Obviously I didn’t stop at one or two, I drank as much as I could as fast as I could. I’m so frustrated with myself. I really NEED to get sober, in so many ways. I need my mental state to be more level. I need my energy up. I need my sleep to be restful. I need my mental acuity to be strong. I need to lose weight so I can be fit and capable for the intense summer part of my job. It’s already starting to kick up and I’m not stepping up and making a difference.

Similarly, I’d bummed a cigarette or two to look cool, but I was never a regular smoker. I was a bit of a nerd and my friends weren’t the partying type, so I had little exposure to that life when I was younger. Then I got to college. I immediately made more friends than I’d ever had in my life, mostly other nerds, but being a nerd was no longer a reason to be outcast or unpopular in college. The nerds still got to drink and party like everyone else. I weighed 320 pounds when I started college so even though my drinking experience was limited, I could still put down more drinks than many older, more seasoned binge drinkers. Smoking a pack of cigarettes with every binge drinking session soon became part of the equation as well. Suddenly I was popular for being a freshman that could drink seniors under the table. I’d never felt popular before, so binge drinking quickly became part of my identity. That being said, I was still a good student, so I would limit my drinking to one or two nights a week. Eventually college party culture led me to opioids. I had already been a vegetarian for several years, but not a healthy one. I was still very overweight because even though I wouldn’t eat something like fried chicken, I would still order three large orders of fries. The opioids changed all that. They destroyed my appetite, so now I was a vegetarian who only ate rice cakes and baby carrots in front of others so they wouldn’t think I was starving myself, but in private I would rarely eat because I had no appetite. Then if I mixed opioids with alcohol, I would almost always vomit. Effectively, the loss of appetite meant I was headed toward anorexia and the vomiting meant I was headed toward bulimia. I went from 320 pounds to 175 in a little over a year. Now not only was I popular for being a binge drinker, I was popular and considered thin and attractive. Dangerous combo for someone who grew up chubby with few friends. Suddenly high risk sexual behavior became one of my vices as well. Eventually I saw that my other friends doing opioids were becoming toxic, and many of our other friends were starting to shut us out. I noticed that my skin was yellow and my eyes were sunken and even though I was thin I no longer looked attractive. I kicked the opioids and haven’t thought about going back for eight years. Shortly after that my older friends who had introduced me to alcohol when I was a freshman started graduating and moving away. My drinking naturally tapered off because I didn’t have as many people to drink with. Then I graduated and moved to a much larger city, much further away from home. 

Initially I was depressed and had no friends, and I was basically a shut in for the first six months of living in my new city. No drinking, maybe the occasional joint, but mostly just staying home watching movies. The expense of living in a new city put a financial strain on me that made me give up my vegetarianism. The weight started to come back from my pre-opioid days. Then I started a graduate school program and the cycle began again. I immediately made friends, I was considered popular and attractive again, and because of how busy I was with grad school I would “forget” to eat sometimes for three days at a time. I would smoke a pack of cigarettes a day and drink two or three pots of coffee to suppress my appetite. I was back to my thinnest, and this time without opioids. I was proud of myself at the time, not realizing that this was still disordered eating. Being thin again led me back to high risk sexual behavior, which of course goes hand in hand with hanging out in bars. I was back to binge drinking two or three nights a week, but I told myself it wasn’t a problem because I had a 4.0. 

Eventually I finished my grad program and with no immediate job prospects I moved into my mother’s guest bedroom in my hometown. The depression took over again. Not being a vegetarian anymore, I would eat fast food with my mom every night. My mom is also a big fan of weed, so instead of alcohol I spent six months in a stoned haze. Finally I found a job as the maintenance worker for a bar district. I immediately started to make friends with the employees in the area and would stop in to a bar after every shift to have a drink and say hi. I was starting to make friends again and it felt good. Eventually this led to me getting hired at two of the bars in the area for much better pay than I was making as a maintenance worker. I had worked part time in restaurants all through college but this was my first time dipping my toes into bar culture, and I loved it. You were encouraged to take shots with customers on the clock, to make it feel like a constant party, all the things that I craved. This is when my drinking started to get the most out of control. Not only was I drinking on my nights off, I was drunk at work every night by the end of my shift. After about two years of this me and two other coworkers decided we were getting tired of this life and it was time to move to a larger city a couple hours away. 

We moved together as roommates and of course the apartment we found was directly across the street from what quickly became our new favorite bar. On most weeknights they would barely charge us for anything because we were their only customers and they knew we would over-tip them. It made drinking very affordable. I was working at a restaurant where I would be off every night between 11PM and 1AM, so I always had 2-4 hours to pop in for a drink, and I could always stumble home without worry because my apartment was across the street. This went on for nearly a year before I recognized it as a problem. My weight had climbed back up to 220, and I wasn’t pursuing relationships or dating or even casual sex because of my body image issues. I knew that my weight gain was because of empty calories from booze, but also because of the availability of late night food when I had the drunk munchies. I would eat maybe 1200-1400 calories throughout the day of salmon and brussel sprouts, then binge 3000 calories of nachos once I was drunk. I decided to do a Whole 30. A very strict elimination diet that includes no alcohol. During this time I started running 5+ miles every day. The weight absolutely disappeared. I was back down to 175 pounds, but unlike when I was on opioids or using coffee and nicotine to suppress my appetite I actually felt good and healthy. I had also nearly quit cigarettes. Then the Whole 30 ended and I celebrated by, you guessed it, binge drinking. That of course meant smoking a whole pack of cigarettes as well. I told myself what’s the point of being thin and attractive if you’re not taking advantage of it by partying in bars? My body issues subsided and although I tried to ease back into dating this quickly reverted to high risk sexual behavior again.

This continued for about a year and then, BOOM, the pandemic hit. Right as everything shit down, my dad also died. We’d never had a good relationship and I was too stressed by the pandemic to try and process his death right away. My roommate and I spent the initial six week shutdown drinking all day and playing video games and surviving on pizza rolls. For two people who seldom get a vacation it almost felt nice. I felt sixteen again, except with booze and cigarettes. Then the boredom started to set in. Because I couldn’t engage in high risk sexual behavior, I began filling that void with a porn addiction. I’ve always had a troubled relationship with porn since I first discovered it at 7 or 8 years old, but this past year it’s spun out of control. I’ve been buying subscriptions to sites, spending money I don’t have, masturbating at least twice a day if not more. The drinking and the poor diet made the weight come back and I told myself I wasn’t ever going to be desirable again so porn was my new partner now. When things started to reopen, I got a position at one of the most popular bars in the city. I was making money hand over fist. I’d never had so much money in my life. I never had to worry about bills. I could drink every night at work for free with my customers and on my off nights I could afford fancy cocktails and expensive meals at high end restaurants. I told myself it wasn’t a problem, it’s just me ingratiating myself into the service industry culture of my city. Then everything shut down again for three months through the winter. Seasonal depression took hold, and I was binge drinking at home every night, even if my roommate wasn’t there. I broke one of my cardinal rules: Never drink alone. The reality of my dad being gone started to take hold and things were spiraling out of control. Finally my job reopened, and I was so relieved to have a reason to leave the house again. Immediately we went into constant party mode. We were so happy to be back and our customers were so happy to see us that it was shots, shots, shots, all the time. It’s been about a month now since we reopened and I just can’t anymore. This weekend I went to brunch before my shift and completely blacked out. I broke two more rules that day: Never drink before the sun goes down and never let drinking interfere with your job. I’m also fully vaccinated now and celebrated boy having dinner at every restaurant I loved with every friend I hadn’t seen in a year. Several rounds of $15 cocktails accompanied each meal, usually with cigars or cigarettes on a dive bar patio afterward as well. As I write this, I have less than $100 in my bank account because of it all. I broke another rule: Never let drinking interfere with your finances. 

I’m 36 hours sober right now. I’ve told myself I’m going to make it through April no matter what, and as my sobriety progresses I’ll be able to work on other habits, like dieting, exercise, cigarettes, and porn addiction. I hate the looks I got from coworkers last night when I declined shots with them. I said I’d take a shot of lemonade or RedBull to still participate in the ritual, but it all felt so uncomfortable. I know it’s possible though. I have two sober coworkers. One for a year, one for five. I turn to them for help, but we rarely work the same shifts, so it can be challenging to find someone to lean on when I need them most. Anyway, as I write this, my shift begins in 45 minutes. Wish me luck on getting through day two ♥️

Dr. Gabor Maté writes about the addictive process and makes the point that the criminal justice system thinks that it is a choice (and that locking people up for certain addictions will slow the growing tide of addiction) and Big Pharma thinks it is a disease and that we should all be taking their drugs (they themselves are addicted to profit at any cost).  Nether is really accurate.  For people who have a problem with alcohol these attitudes don't help.  All those clinics pushing Vivitrol and all the people who look at you funny if you tell them you don't drink are not helping.

&#x200B;

Dr. Maté suggests that the more interesting question is, ""What do you get from it that you were not getting from your life?""

For me it was relief from anxiety. I experienced anxiety around social situations that went away when I drank.  I was anxious around girls so I had a few drinks and could ask them to dance.  I was anxious playing music but could have a few drinks at the bar so I could feel good about playing. Eventually I was anxious without drinking so I had to drink all the time.  When I wasn't drinking (I managed to stay off of it for years) I took Klonopin. How many people in recovery are on some medication? Of course the problem with Klonopin is that it is very difficult to stop because it is so addictive -- just like alcohol (they both work on the same part of the brain, probably why they co-occur so often).

Today is 124 days off of alcohol (and Klonopin). and I am anxious.  It is ok -- I have been able to sleep and my appetite is ok.  This community helps me remember why I want to stay stopped.  It also reminds me just how insidious the problem is.  I can't snap my fingers and make the anxiety go away, the only solutions available to me now aren't the kind that work with 15 minutes or less.  Dealing with my anxiety is going to take the rest of my life. That was always true, it is just that today I *agree.*",12,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44182828}"

That amazing medical care saved my life - I've been sober ever since and happier than I ever thought I could be again - but it came at a severe cost: I didn't have health insurance at the time after losing my job and being too drunk to sign up for any other options.  

The amazing clarity and joy I felt upon my release from the hospital, sober for the first time in years, was severely weighed down by the $220,000 hospital bill I received, which I had no hope of ever paying in my current state.  

I was first rejected twice after applying for retroactive coverage through my state's low-income coverage program, so I then began the long process of trying for financial assistance through the hospital. I was hopeful for something, anything, even a reasonable payment plan to help with this medical debt, knowing this was a financial hole that could potentially take decades to dig myself out of. I wrote letters, made countless phone calls, had to re-apply from scratch after my application was lost, submitted multiple rounds of in-depth documents per their request, and played the waiting game through COVID as their office was significantly disrupted. All the while I was fairly certain that if I received any help at all, it would be minimal, but I held onto whatever hope I could. I've lost so much sleep over this debt over the last 2 years.  

Anyway, I received a letter in the mail today from the hospital...AND THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HAS FORGIVEN 100% OF MY MEDICAL DEBT!!!  

I'm still a little in shock, but this is possibly the most amazing thing that has ever happened to me aside from getting sober in the first place. I logged into my account just to be sure I wasn't dreaming, and sure enough there it was: ""Balance Due - $0."" I can't even describe the weight that has been lifted off my shoulders, and I feel like the darkest chapter of my alcoholism can finally be closed.

Both situations are the same, I plan on coming out to my beautiful family cottage to get away from the city, job, girlfriend, kids, etc. Somewhere along the way I tell myself that I should cut loose and have a drink. It’s all about me right?

As I’ve posted before the first 4 drinks are the best. So good. Just a good buzz where you can still do things and talk to people and be relaxed and feel like yourself. But after 4 I fell right back into my old habits immediately. I smoked half a pack of cigarettes, 9 more beers, 3 glasses of whiskey, basically my daily regular quota of about 15 drinks in an evening. 

This morning was the worst sickness experience of my life, second only to food poisoning in Mexico but tbh it was very close. I vomited for at least 6 hours straight. And I mean that gut wrenching vomiting where there is nothing left in you but your abdomen is trying to wring out your stomach like a wet cloth. 

A good 6 hours of the food poisoning cycle. Heavy vomiting followed by 5 minutes of intense relief, then ravaging thirst, followed by a glass of water and then 20 minutes of my body slowly absorbing a small amount of water and rejecting the rest and then back to the toilet. Rinse and repeat over 12 times, I lost track. 

I’ve finally came to, can barely stand up and walk around without Nausea but I’m keeping down liquids and soft candies just to keep my blood sugar up. 

I’m writing this post to remind future me that although I can be sober, and choose to have a bender, it comes at a huge cost. There are enjoyable parts to drinking but I’ve just lost at least a full day of my life, probably more as tomorrow I’ll be shaky and sore. I really don’t want to live in any cycle with alcohol, even one where I do this every few months. The cycle is still the cycle, the trap is still the trap.

Hi Friends,

Drank yesterday. I know why. I see the pattern in my mind. That’s a plus. 

For the last 3 months almost every time I’ve gotten a bottle of wine is directly after I’ve been outside for a long walk-hike or bike ride. It clearly has something to do with being hungry after exercising and being calorie deficient and craving the sugar. It’s also my old favorite of drinking on an empty stomach to get that extra swift and strong buzz. Maybe its also the ‘extra cherry on top’ thing of a little bit more high after the exercise boost. So, I am going to put extra effort into bringing yummy snack or ice cream (in cold box?) even to-go dinner with me in the car for when I get back from a hike. 

This morning’s journaling led to more insights. I feel like there are ‘different rules’ for my behavior when I’m outside of my house. Weird, yes, I know. But it feels like I get into a freer headspace away from my little apartment cave. With the ‘free’ mindset it feels like sobriety is a distant thing I don’t have to adhere to and its time for treats! It’s like the whole sobriety thing is still so, so tentative that if I change one bit of my identity—i.e, out in the world, all kinds of other ‘values’ come crashing in. I get it why rehab is valuable—a structured environment.

The other thing I realized is that I feel sad and lonely when I think about going home and being alone. Just that. I’m lonely and don’t want to deal with it. My job starts in 3 weeks, so things may change when it begins. But the old-familiar numbing agent is always so, so available and I feel so weak when I am outside sometimes. I guess it’s the old HALT thing. Plus, ‘fuck-it’ mindset feels like it runs free when I get tired and it’s nearly impossible to talk it down after ‘fuck-it’ gets hold of my brain.

It’s nice counting days but that isn’t the important part of everyone’s journey. It’s recognizing what makes you want to drink and what helps you stay sober. 

I’ve spent a lot of time alone the last 90 days and it’s been to limit my exposure to friends and family that drinks. It’s hard to be around it and you need to be prepared to make the necessary changes to really commit. 

You have to be able to say “No.” Put your sobriety first and over time I’ve been able to open my life back up to more. It’s a slow process and it needs to be while I re-learn what life is like this way. 

Learning to find happiness alone and dealing with life on my terms and not numbing the problems and dealing with them later. This has been pivotal in my sobriety as it has allowed me to move on and not hold onto my guilt and stress. 

Fill my time with constructive hobbies. I’ve been going to the gym, spending time with healthy family, working on eating better and I’m looking forward to learning how to fish this summer! 

If you are struggling and want to be sober, make a plan for the cravings/urges as you’ll have them. They do pass and it’s been easy for me these last few weeks. I’m ultra motivated now and feel great.

2021-04-02 15:22:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mirhu8/on_day_two/,On Day Two,"My tracker needs to be reset. I am on Day Two. Day one was an absolute nightmare. I spent the day crying, shaking with nerves, unable to eat more than a few bites, having suicidal ideation, and my mind was running rampant with anxiety and intrusive thoughts. I couldn’t fall asleep until 5 am, and when I did I had horrible dreams. I considered going to the hospital in the middle of the night to get some sort of anti anxiety medication, but ultimately didn’t go. I am seriously considering going on an SSRI, I’ve been very against it for a long time but I absolutely cannot continue to use alcohol,  so I may need something to help with the anxiety I’ve been numbing. 

I just don’t want to forget this feeling. I’m worried that once I get a few weeks or a few months, I’ll forget and think I can drink again. I can’t. I want to post this here partly to have it to look back on and remember how I felt because of drinking. Alcohol has caused many bad things to happen; it’s put me in physical and mental danger, it’s taken so much money, it’s taken relationships. I feel like even my cat is frustrated and concern, he seems depressed since I started up again on last Friday. It breaks my heart that even he knows, but I hope to never have him go through this again and have him trust me again. 

I am considering at outpatient treatment program. Has anyone ever had experience with this? Was it helpful? They are much more expensive than AA/SMART recovery, but I am willing to try if they are truly effective. Should I start with AA/SMART instead?

for me, drinking made me very introspective and made me think a lot about my past mistakes.

when i was drunk, i used to think about the things i could have achieved, the things i could have done differently, and the things i could be doing instead of drinking.

they say addiction is always tied to an emotion and i got so used to associating drinking with sadness that's eventually what stuck.

towards the end of my drinking addiction, there was no more joy left in it. much like a broken or toxic relationship. it's there because you think it's a component of your life that is necessary to function despite knowing that it causes you damage, that it'll let you down, that it'll hold you back, and that it will bring you down.

that's why actual romantic relationships with another person that fail don't just simply end, they down spiral whether you notice it or not. it used to be an energy and companionship filled with hope and joy and every time you got a dose of that person it would do nothing but bring you up so you associate it with only positive feelings. but if things repeatedly go wrong (which they always do when you abuse alcohol), you start associating more and more bad energy and bad memories with this person that you eventually reach a point where you can no longer celebrate this person. you become frustrated with this person, you lash out at them uncontrollably, you resent this person and yet you stay with them until you find the courage to get up and leave.

1- if you were drunk when you crashed your car, if you were drunk when you got arrested, if you were drunk for that fight at a holiday party, if you were drunk when you got fired from your job, if you got drunk when that person left you, if you got fat because of being drunk, that time a loved one found all those empty bottles, that time you called or said to somebody something you should have not...... you will most likely associate the feeling of being drunk with all that you felt during the aftermath of all that.

2- people who have a good relationship with alcohol experience much much less scenarios listed above. people who have a good relationship with alcohol associate more it with the joy they felt at a wedding, or the holiday party with all the joy, or that spectacular first date, or that job promotion, finding out your wife is pregnant, finding out the sex of your child, when your team won, those deep talks with your mom/dad/loved one.

i think i speak for a lot of us here too when i say people like me associate drinking more so with #1.

A have a great support system of amazing friends and family which I advised this time to shun the barterer.

I honestly believe with alcohol there are three sides. Yours, theirs, and alcohol's. Alcohol has a way of warping, distorting, and shaping both the good and bad of every interaction. Last Saturday, my friend hosted a birthday bash for me and like 10 other people. It was supposed to be a fun event. Drinking and laughing and good times. Oh, alcohol, you came in and took that away. I thought we were on the same team. I recently started dating a guy of about 6 months that truly adores me and is so good to me. Problem is I live in a small town and everyone knows his past and although he has grown from it and is a better person, it haunts him. Not because he is a bad person, but because he has a history here. People won't get to know the current person. The person that grew and learned. I didn't grow up in this town. But, I am friends with a group of friends that did. They all know him. They all know me. I thought they were my friends. I thought they loved me. I met this guy about 9 months ago and we chatted. I was like huh, he is kind of cute. After that day, we continued to talk and suprisingly, at least to me, I was pleasantly surprised to find that he was an actual nice guy and he pursued me and made me feel lovely and worthy of love. I have never felt this way about anyone or have anyone feel this way about me. Even my ex-husband never made me feel like I hung the stars and moon. My guy and I are very affectionate. Probably sickening so. I am ok with it. I love physical touch. My friends have been ok with it up until now. But, Saturday, oh Saturday, all of that changed. We were all drinking. Having a good time. I know my friends don't love this guy like I do, but I thought we were all doing well. This guy and I even stayed away from each other for most of the night. BUT, and a big BUT, at one point, someone asked my boyfriend who his best friend was and he said me. This next part I should preface it with saying in 2019, I got a DUI and so did my friend. We became besties through are shared experience, we stopped drinking. I truly believe I am an alcoholic (I know I picked up drinking again, sigh), but she did not believe herself to be one. We became each others confidants and helped each other tremendously through it all. We have grown apart over the past year due to circumstances and probably me being in a relationship (as she is single). So, when asked about my best friend, I felt stuck. Who do I say? My friend or my boyfriend. It is so juvenile it makes me what to puke. They are both are, but alcohol clouded my otherwise witty self and I said my friend and not my boyfriend. He felt embarrased and was deeply hurt. I understand this because we have had many discussions of how he wants his partner to be his best friend. And, right now, he truly is my number one. After that, I pretty much clung to him the rest of the night trying to undo the hurt I inflicted. The next day, I got a text from my friend, not the same friend I had been through the DUI with, that said I was disgusting and to kiss her ass because I was up my boyfriend's ass all night. I don't really believe this to be true, but what I do know is this: if i wasn't drunk, if I hadn't been intoxicated, I would A) handled the situation better, and B) I would have had the recollection of what actually went down. Right now I have neither and I don't know if I truly did anything bad or if she is overreacting or if alcohol is the true villian. I do know that I have been ousted from my friend group (not really sad as birds of a feather flock together) and my friend who threw the party thinks I am unappreciative and a complete disgusting fool for overstepping in the PDA. Alcohol has a way of ruining even the most innocent of moments. It clouds everyone's judgement and creates a false sense of reality. All of us were drunk at that party. I miss the days where I could stand in my mistakes because I made them in clarity and not impaired. I guess the point is that alcohol can cloud everything. It is a stealer of true joy and really, robs us of feeling true emotion and clarity of thought. I don't know if I want or need my relationship to be repaired with those that judged me because birds of a feather flock together, but I do know I don't want to question my actions again without the clarity that sobriety brings.

I’ve been creeping on this thread for about a year now... I’ve always wanted to post but never knew where to begin or what to say.

I guess I’ll start with “I’m done.”

Man, I’m so done with this! I’m 27F and I don’t think I’ve gone two weeks without getting drunk since I was 19. No one in my life would say I have a problem with drinking—but that’s not really the point, is it? It’s been a problem for me for 6.5 years now. It’s been a twisted love affair and I think it may finally be over...

I say it this way because I’ve wanted to stop, to cut down, to try and control it for years now. But deep down I could feel I wasn’t truly ready to quit. It was a challenge I wasn’t ready to take on, and it was even more challenging because I’ve been a bartender for the last couple years. But I’m ready now. I’m done.

In January I quit my bartending job. My habits had been improving a lot but I could feel them resurface. I haven’t worked since then, I’ve been taking my time in the job search and wanted to be very careful and intentional about the postings I applied to. I’m beginning work at a local art museum and with another company as a photographer and I’m so relieved I don’t have to bartend anymore! Also, just stoked to be in a line(s) of work that align with what I’d like to do with my life.

Anyways, I had the goal to go two weeks without drinking and failed last weekend. It wasn’t even the drinking I was craving but the social interaction. This is what I’m most nervous about honestly. How can I still be social with my friends and not drink? The group of friends I have are sincerely the best people I have ever met! It’s just an unfortunate fact that we all bonded over craft beer (and music!) so everything we do together, alcohol is involved in some capacity. I know they’d be willing to help me figure this out though... I know some get tired of all the drinking, too.

On my way home that night I got pulled over. First time I ever got pulled over after having a few. I was calm, fully ready to accept my fate and get charged with a DWI/DUI. I completely deserved it, putting myself and others in danger. But miraculously the officer gave me a warning and asked me to call someone to pick me up. I couldn’t believe it... I think it was a stern sign from the universe to cut the shit out and dedicate myself to a life without alcohol.

Like I said I’m nervous about how to handle going about social outings... so far I’ve just been keeping a low profile and asking friends to meet for coffee instead of a beer.

But everything else I’m so excited for. I genuinely feel giddy thinking about all the health benefits I’ll gain back, the energy I’ll feel, the new friends and hobbies I’ll encounter. I’m looking forward to being present. I’m too young to have this many fuzzy memories with the ones I love. 

I’m day 5 with no alcohol and I plan to have many more. I’ll probably start posting a lot on here to process my relationship with alcohol and things I’m learning. I hope to make virtual friends who can help me hold myself accountable. So if you read this whole thing, say hey 👋🏻

When I was training martial arts I would only have half a pint but in my most athletic states I was drinking.  It got in the way of my second fight camp, its got in the way with my social life as I would rather stay home and drink that go to a family members or friends house.  I have a baby on the way and yesterday morning I had a bad pain in my upper right abdomen.  I planed on stopping before the baby was born and with a four day weekend due to weather I bit the bullet and got back on the wagon.

I think I try to fill awkward silences with wine. Since I do not have a lot of the same patterns of “regular alcoholics” it’s easy to downplay my issue and I’m worried it will lead to a relapse. It gets out of hand often. I find it impossible to moderate sometimes. I’ve gotten myself into dangerous and embarrassing situations, hurt myself and others. 

I’m worried now that the days have passed since my last drinking session and quit day I’ll forget about the reasons I quit and drink again when we have guests over on Sunday.

During my first trimester the thought of alcohol made me feel physically ill as I was battling nausea and fatigue anyways and didn’t need to add to that. I was relieved because it made it so much easier to give up drinking. 

I’ve been sober-curious for a while and have done dry months here and there, but was actually excited to have pregnancy/breastfeeding as an ironclad reason to give up drinking entirely for 9-12ish months.  I even started thinking about never drinking ever again! I didn’t miss it and being the only sober one around other people who are drinking, even casually, made me realize how pointless it is and how much easier it is to just not drink at all rather than trying to control it. 

Then BOOM. I’m sitting in my living room the other night, watching TV, and suddenly I’m thinking about how nice it would be to have a cool, crisp of white wine and just melt into my sofa. I logically know I’m romanticizing it - telling myself that I just like the taste, which lol alcohol tastes like poison it is and I’d never drink it without the effect- but emotionally I just wanted it so bad. I swear I started salivating. 

I won’t drink. It’s not an option for me while pregnant. I posted here instead of on the pregnancy subreddit I’m active on because I knew if I posted there I might get some replies along the lines of “it’s totally fine to have just one glass!” and that’s a door that needs to stay firmly shut for me. These past three months are the longest I’ve gone without a drop of alcohol since I turned 21 about a decade ago and I’m so proud of myself.

I’ve been sober for about 4 months and it’s been going pretty amazing so far. If you read my post history you will see I’ve been on a wonderful fitness journey and I’ve really been loving it. My life is undoubtedly so much better when I’m sober.

But something else is creeping up. Maybe because spring is coming. Maybe because I just got the covid vaccine and it feels like an end to the pandemic is in sight. Maybe because Opening Day was yesterday in my city and I didn’t celebrate it like usual. But I’m starting to feel angry and glum about being sober despite knowing how much better off I am.

I just feel, well, angry. I realize now that a big part of me is really mourning the fact that I “can’t” drink any more, not just that I won’t drink any more. It used to be a huge way for me to unwind, celebrate, and just get time to myself. I used to absolutely love meeting my girlfriends for drinks at our favorite bars and enjoying the weather. It felt like such great time for me to be away from my young kids and just not have to WORRY about them. Drinking was a symbol of turning off mom mode and just getting to be me.

Of course, now I see how problematic all of that was for me. And how the hangover that was inevitably waiting for me the next day was so, so deeply not worth it. Playing the tape forward is probably the most valuable tool I have. Because I know the hangxiety and misery was tearing me apart.

But on a day like today, where the sun is out and it’s an auspicious Easter weekend, I feel an unmistakeable anger. Almost like “okay, is this sobriety thing over yet?” And I don’t know what to do about it because I really, really don’t want to relapse.

I recently read Allan Carr's Easy Way to Stop Drinking and it really changed my perspective on drinking. I'm also now doing something called 30 Day Alcohol Experiment. There's a book to go with it. It's a free course online. It's literally been amazing! I've come to realise that I've been trying to use my willpower all these years to fight my addiction whereas now, after reading these books and doing this course I am focusing on what I have to gain from getting sober rather than what I am loosing or giving up. It's been a game changer.

I know 7 days is nothing but usually by now I am gasping for a big glass of prosecco-or anything I can get my hands on really! I just want a drink. This time round I'm not feeling that way at all.

I'm 45 years old, and today marks the first time I've been 10 days alcohol free in well over 10 years.  I know this is only the first step, and I've got a very long road ahead -- which could quite possibly be a bumpy road.  But the path is finally clear for me, as it is for so many of you.  And I look forward to forging up this new path (rather than descending down my old path).  

I'm a student of history, and I like to draw energy from historical events and famous quotes.  So in my mind I'm comparing my present battle and position to that of the Allies after finally defeating the Germans in North Africa and changing the tide of WWII, when Winston Churchill famously said: 

 *Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.*

I haven’t been doing that well - been doing a lot better than some but still struggling with this poison. Got a great job, make a lot of money, have a home, cars, pets, wife, child...I’ve got it all. 

Yesterday we found out my daughter was sick (she’s only 8months old, first time being really sick), and instead of making sure I stayed sober to help with her I drank a lot (whole fifth of London dry - yum!). I even went to an AA meeting yesterday, picked up a second pint before the meeting with every intent on drinking when I left (and yes, I did drink it - or at least I think I did?).

The day has come for me to seek help - really seek help. This day has long since been here, I just haven’t been honest with myself that I can’t stop on my own. I’m worried for my life, my family, my job. But most of all I’m worried what people will think of me (go figure). 

I’m a professional and damn good at what I do. But I’m just not cutting it anymore. Alcohol has taken control of my life, my finances, my health, my relationships are at its will - and boy does it like messing with stuff.

Anyways, I think I’m finally being honest with myself. I can’t do this on my own. I can’t stop. I need help. I just hope that someone is able to help and that after seeking help I’m able to stay sober. If I don’t get sober and stay sober I have no illusions that I will lose my job, wife, family will write me off, friends will have to push me away, oh, and I will most definitely die a young man. 28. Severe binge drinker and alcoholic for 10 years.

And some of us woke up giving up, already expecting the weight of our burdens to crush us and twist our arm into giving in by the end of the day.

All of us however have the same end goal in mind. We all WANT the same thing, despite how our addictions and burdens sway us throughout today. We want to be free of them.

The vodka in the water bottles, the red nose and cheeks after she had a few----pretty spot on.

Friday - There’s always a plan

So Springtime is in full gear.  It’s starting to get warmer and we are headed for the summer and for a lot of us, this means attempting things that we haven’t been able to do.  As restrictions relax there will inevitably be more places to visit and more things to do.  Whether it’s just going to church or to a friends place or getting out to larger gatherings.  I feel as if we are on the edge of being able to move and run about a little more easily.

Unfortunately what comes along with it is pressure.  Maybe a bottle of wine caught your eye at the store and made you take a second look.  Maybe you saw that billboard with the ice-cold beer on it.  Or maybe you got straight up asked to take a drink at a gathering, the pressure to drink will also be in full gear.

In my honest opinion this new found way of life that I celebrate comes with a life-long effort.  A commitment that I must take seriously because my life depends on it.  And if I fail, I fail not only myself but everyone in which I have touched in some way.

And I am not going to do that.  I am not going to fail because I have a plan.  My plan is not something that I’ve laid out on a piece of paper.  A list of things that I should or shouldn’t do.  My plan is simply to succeed.  Sometimes I envision myself 5 years from now.  Sometimes 10 or 20.  The vision is always something like I have now.  Keeping busy and visiting family and friends.  Being grateful for what I have.  Somehow finding ways of trying to be kind, even if the world doesn’t reciprocate it.

More often than not the plan is improvised for the next hour, evening or day.  Fortunately for me my weekend will be no different than any other weekend.  I have weekend chores at the apartment I live in.  I have a new table saw that I need practice on.  I have a house to visit and clean.  I have a guitar that needs my attention and I have food to grill.  I have family and friends to visit.  I’m also fortunate that I’m much older now and my friends and family don’t gather around to celebrate as much.  Meaning the pressures of drinking are much lower than they used to be when I was younger.  My plan will work because I have chosen to make them work!!

If you choose to participate, tell me what plans you have for your weekend.

I will not be drinking with you today!!

Money problems kids misbehaving just all sorts of every day stress. My wife and I had a huge argument and I stormed out. Called my buddy decided to have a bro night. Went to the batting cages then to a local bbq joint. While we were there he invited me back to his place and I decided that tonight was the night. Said hey I wanna stop at the liquor store and get an NA beer. My buddy said “can we just go to the grocery I need coffee anyway.” Sure no problem. 

Get to the grocery as I suspected they had no NA beer. Decided I would grab a six pack. Went to the beer cooler and grabbed a 6 pack of rolling rock. On my way to the counter I saw a strawberry kiwi drink I never see anywhere. I snapped back to reality and put the beer back bought 6 Minute Maid strawberry kiwi. Told my buddy I wasn’t gonna get beer when he met me in line and he said “I know that’s why I didn’t want to go into the liquor store.” My friend was saving me from myself without me even knowing. 

We talked and he told me he saw me with the beer and wasn’t gonna say anything until I was in line and for sure buying it. He was giving me a chance to think for myself but had my back in case I didn’t. I’m sitting here now with heartburn out of this world because fruity carbonated drinks do that to me but I’m sober. I really really feel like an idiot for considering throwing away this much time but this addiction is no joke. 

I am so thankful that I reached out to the friend I did. He really is one of the best friends I have. I wrote in my journal and made sure I calmed down. I’m so thankful I didn’t give in today. The sense of relief is overwhelming. I have no guilt or regret today. I almost did but I got it back together. If it happens again I know what to do.

My issue was when I drank I drank way too much (as in I’d black out most nights that I was drinking) and back then I felt like I needed alcohol to be social. These past three months I have worked hard to gain some more social skills and figure out which friends are true friends and which are “party friends” and I don’t want all of my progress to get thrown out of the window just because of a 21st birthday.

I didn't heed the warning signs. And my ticket was finally called back in December for the first time. If you look at my previous posts I tried quitting for the first time coming up on two years ago. I had some months of success. Kind of off and on over the last two years. 

November of 2020 I told my wife ""I quit quitting"" because I was sick of failing over and over. 

Two weeks later I found myself in the county jail. Lost my job in a professional field that I dreamed about since I was 6 and worked towards since I was 16. Great pay. Great benefits. Dream career, never to be let back in. Friends turned their back on me completely. Wife had to contemplate divorce (which I can say thankfully we are together today)... but I greatly damaged our relationship. Social reputation fractured. Inlaw's trust almost completely broken. Had the joy of telling them what I did. 

The last 3.5 months have been the most painful of my entire life. I have never been brought so low. 

I never in a million years believed I could have found myself in this situation-- believing it was not in my character. This came to a shock to me as much as it did anyone who knows me. But I was warned many times by some of the red flags. It finally happened.

Please. For the love of God. If you think you're untouchable and that you can safely get hammered and nothing will ever happen to you. Heed my warning. Stop now. You are capable of the unthinkable. You're fine 99.9% of the time when you drink, sure, but it just takes that ONE set of perfect circumstances for the stars to align... and BOOM! The pain is not worth it-- and I promise you...it will come. It is only a matter of time. I was warned and I didn't listen. Please listen.

Woke up a tad groggy but a shower and some coffee got the engine going. Laughed and learned at work. Clocked out with no regrets and ate some food. Ended the day chilling with a friend and playing games.,"It did get rough near the middle, I will readily admit. My discord was silent, and I had no one to talk to, but I found something to do (cleaned up my room basically) and just passed the time. I didn't let it become an excuse. 

Tomorrow.. well tomorrow is gonna be a toughie for sure. I know that, but I'm honestly not prepared. Last Friday, the only reason I ""made it through"" was that I woke up hungover the previous thursday, immediately downed a fifth of fireball, went back to sleep around 5pm thursday, and woke up around 10pm that same day. I had work, and sleep wasn't happening. So I stayed up all not, had an hour nap before work. Needless to say, I was genuinely too tired to drink, even if I wanted to, and I did want to, to be honest. 

Beyond physically not being able to, that messed my sleeping schedule up bad for the rest of the weekend. I was basically awake when it was to late to buy anything.  And while trying to fix that schedule, I was often too tired pushing myself to stay up an extra hour to leave the house. Work was taxing, and I often found myself napping on the clock.

The first few days I was a wreck. depressed, borderline suicidal, anxious, angry, every emotion I had that wanted me to hate myself was spiraling out of control. Not fun. I posted here a lot, and kept making each day. By Tuesday I was still in the dumps, but the schedule was back mostly. Wednesday, I started feeling better, and today I actually had a good night's rest and will do so again tonight. 

That leaves me with tomorrow. I know they say worry about the now, but let's face it, tomorrow is real and I have to deal with it. Once I get off work, I'm done for a few days. My mind will say ""just tonight."" I will respond, ""you know that's not how it works."" My mind will say ""well we have to learn to moderate eventually."" I will say ""actually I just want to quit. I feel fine right now."" 

This conversation will persist, like a child tugging at my pants in the store wanting candy, but I'm saying no. It'll cry, it'll yell, it's going to get crazy. But I know better. And I'll tell the the child that, and that'll it'll be okay, but the child won't stop. I know these things, and I'm prepared for them. 

What I'm not prepared for, is feeling fine, awake, and present while all these feelings and thoughts begin to rush in. I won't be bed ridden tired this Friday. I won't be so sick to my stomach I cant hold water down. I won't feel so bloated trying to get out of bed hurts for some reason. Ill have a clean desk, and room, and made bed to convince me I have things under control. And it'll be Friday. The weekend. 

Tomorrow, despite my perseverance through this week will be hard. I have no excuses. A little nerdy, but it reminds of a lord of the rings quote from pippen, when he's talking to gandalf. ""I don't want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse."" 

I use to think of that before I did speeches in school, and it always made me feel better for some reason. In the movie hey prevail and win eventually. Being brave is not not being afraid, it's overcoming fear when it comes. All of that stuff. I feel that way about tomorrow. I can't escape it. I'm going to have to live through it, and overcome whatever it brings. I don't know how to be honest, or if I even can at this point. But I can't escape it, and that's scary I guess. 

I don't want to lose what I have. If I could, is stay up all night tonight so that again, I could be so so tired tomorrow that drinking will physically not be an option. In fact maybe I will. Does that teach me anything though? Or do me any good? 

I'm probably overthinking it. I tend to do that. Anyways, another long post from jkday3. Sorry I tend to ramble a bit. Either way, time for bed.",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5209472}"

I’m finally reaching out here in hopes to get some thoughts/advice/opinions, etc. I’ve been a daily drinker for essentially 12 years now with my worst being drinking a bottle of wine daily for a few of those. It’s gotten to the point where it’s time to stop. It’s all consuming, health problems everywhere and the pandemic has shown how really dependent I am on it. However, I don’t know how to describe what I’m feeling about quitting. Like I’m pissed off that I have to? That I don’t really want to cause it’s the one good part of my day?  However, some health challenges have come my way that have really scared me, possible alcoholic neuropathy and possible liver damage. As terrifying as those things are, I still haven’t stopped drinking. Cut way back? Yes. Stop? No. It’s like it’s created even more anxiety about what this last decade of drinking may have done to my body EVEN if I do quit now. Kind of like the stories of smokers who quit after decades then get diagnosed with COPD or lung cancer and they think “well why did I even stop?” I have tools to quit (therapist, meds such as naltrexone or baclofen), but I’m still annoyed. I’m frustrated with myself but already know the benefits are waiting for me as after cutting back, I’m already feeling better (more sleep, functioning more in the mornings). There’s a small feeling that freedom is close if I just stop. Maybe I need baby steps. Anyway, I’m usually better at articulating my words, but unsure how to put it all done yet.

I go through a 5th of Svedka or like 8 white claws every two days, sometimes more sometimes less, but always at least enough to get buzzed.

I know I need to stop now, I'm graduating soon and I don't want to ruin my body anymore.

I'm scared to stop. I have stopped for a few days before, and I was able to make it through. I'm just scared im going to have a seizure this time or something. Im not at home, im at college, so I can't really go to my parents if I start freaking out.

I guess I just want to know if I'm at the point of definitely being at a level where I will experience severe withdrawals. Not a single person in my life knows about this. Everyone knows I drink, but no one knows every day. I have tried to confide in my siblings, but they just say ""youre fine its not like youre drinking every single day!"" And no, I am getting drunk every single day.

Should I call my doctor to help me go through it? She is unaware too. Will I be fine if I just stop drinking tomorrow? Should I taper off? I just don't want to go through a terrible and potential detox all by myself. I can power through anxiety, but if I'm gonna lose control of my body and stuff I don't know what to do.

It feels so good to not only have my own sobriety, but to be able to cheer someone else on in this daily battle. Additionally, another coworker who’s currently struggling with alcohol was there for the conversation and I just hope that we could be a positive influence by showing her that sober life is a good life.

I've been working hard on school work this week, walking loads, eating well, in a good sleep routine and doing a lot of self care. 

Yesterday I had a meeting with my recover support worker. I saw the recovery center and all the amazing work and activities they have available when lockdown is over. I felt so positive and happy about all the new and exciting things I can engage in now that I've chosen a sober and better life. 

But today, I just felt like throwing the towel in and drinking. Going back to the familiar, the blurred, dark and emotional world. 

I didn't. At 11pm I had a coffee and decided I would stay up late. I broke the routine, I did something I don't normally do. It's an hour and a half after I normally go to sleep. I feel rebellious, I feel satisfied. 

I made it through day 82. It was the hardest day I've had in a while but I made it.

I was happy when I stopped. I managed to go 3 months off (with only 5 days on) and I understood what people who do it long term are talking about. But then at the end of dry January lockdown boredom hit and I still haven't come out of it. I dont blackout. I don't do anything destructive. I just drink too much every goddam day and it's making me worse.

But at the moment I just can't stop. I have depression issues which are being exacerbated by the pandemic (and general world events and the sad decline of the species) so drinking is my (shitty) crutch. Drinking is also something which has provided good memories for me in the past. It's normalised among my friends (important to clarify: long term friends not just drinking buddies) and now the UK lockdown is starting to recede there is talk of a monumental pissup. I've read all the most recommended books and know all the evils of alcohol, but FOMO is also playing a part. If I give it up completely then I'll miss out when my mates who can ""drink normally"" have a party. It feels like I've spoilt a good thing by over indulging. (I know it's not a good thing, but society says it is...)

I have also been through the whole night-sweats and semi hallucination level of withdrawal before so I refuse to stop cold turkey. Which means I taper. When it works it's fine. When it doesn't it just gets put off until tomorrow. It's like the anti-IWNDWYT. _I will stop drinking with you tomorrow_. (Don't have to worry about it today, I'll do it tomorrow). I'm fully aware that I'm self sabotaging myself, but when everything else seems pointless then ""what's the harm?"". I'm not at the point of actual self harm, but I'm not feeling particularly inclined to look after myself either.

My girlfriend thinks I should seek counseling. I agree, but I suck at speaking about my issues (hence my massive rant here). Plus looking at my life on the surface I have it pretty good. It's just my head that's fucked up. (Which is probably a consequence of alcohol....)

TL;DR I have issues and I know I should fix them, instead I numb myself. I know I should stop numbing myself so I can fix them, but being numb is comfortable.

Anyways just needed to spill. I'm like Jekyll and Hyde at the moment. I know what I should do, but only 40-60% of me is on board with the decision at any given moment. All it takes to derail it is a slight swing in the other direction. Which is annoying because I've stopped several times before.

And I'm lying here feeling horrified that I used to DO THIS TO MYSELF ON PURPOSE. I called this feeling, this exact debilitation, a ""hangover,"" because it would happen every time I'd drink, and by the time I felt well the next day, two days later it was time to drink again. 

I didn't know I had migraines until after I stopped, and one day I got a ""hangover"" out of the blue. I thought this was normal, and I endured it just to be able to have that drink.  (Writing this I start to feel sick again...)

21 Years Old College Student
No internships, which I didn’t care about when i was drinking. I’ve started practicing for several certificates, alongside 6 college classes i’m taking (all of which i really enjoy! It’s just a lot of work), alongside a company competition, alongside (hopefully) working at the draft, alongside anything I can handle? 

The crazy thing is I feel like i can handle a lot.
I’ve switched from THC to Delta-8 too, which honestly from all my research is probably still partially weed, but it definitely feels like a positive reduction in that habit, and i actually feel positive about putting this down (in replace of cbd and other plants) sooner than later. 

Honestly if I ever do get an interview part of me really just wants to tell them my proudest accomplishment is getting sober, BUT I’M 21 SO that’s not the best look. 

In my professional life, I feel like I’m catching up to my peers and that feels really good. As a business student it’s all about getting your foot in the door, and I haven’t done that yet, but I’m not beating myself up.

Everyday I’m excited to grow more and more. I am very confident in myself, and honestly I’m really happy with the people I have around me and the year I have planned ahead of me. 

That’s another thing, I’ve planned the year.
What the fuck? I’m so cool. 

(P.S. If you’ve read this far, you’re also pretty rad. Here’s my extra piece: N/A beer is interesting. I’ve bought a case a few times and they’re all good, but I finish the case, which i think is because i only drink N/A beers when I’m with people drinking heavily (in college remember) I don’t drink them for fun by myself, which is something I did a lot when i was drinking alcohol, basically N/A reminds me of how much i could drink if i wanted to, and how disgusting that used to be, a bittersweet thing)

My life feels healthy and buoyant I am struck by the isolation I sometimes feel as a housewife with no kids.  It was a big trigger of me using -- being alone. Getting back to work and school is one of the reasons I decided I needed to change my life through my habits. 

I got on an SSRI at the same time I quit using, which I think has helped me not abuse. But it's been having a downside of making me fatigued by 3 PM. I went down on the dose and feel hopeful (from prior experience with this med) that the lower dose will help me with my anxiety while also allowing me to have energy. Anyhow, this isn't an anxiety med sub, so let me get on to my next subject. 

Using nonalcoholic beer has been helping me, along with reading This Naked Mind by Annie Grace, and reading and posting on this sub every day. My craving for nonalcoholic beer seems to be subsiding, although I'm sure this could change. I haven't gone to AA or NA at all for a while now, but am tentatively planning on going today. The AA group runs at the same time me and my buddies usually work out at, which is a little unfortunate. I gotta wake up earlier and start making the early noon NA/AA meetings. 

The drama of alcohol is currently a non-factor in my life. The stress over getting it, affording it, splitting it with my husband, not having money for it, am i drinking too much, am i drinking too fast, are we gonna drink, who's paying -- that's all gone. And it's cleared so much space in my head. And I feel like the real me. I feel a little sharper, a little better in every way. 

One way I contribute to our household is managing talking to all the people you gotta talk to in your late 20s and 30s: making the doctor's and dentist's appointments, communicating with the landlady and her manager and workmen, talking to the insurance agencies and getting quotes from multiple companies to get the best deal, doing the grocery shopping, cleaning up the house, growing vegetables , organizing and knowing where everything is, reading and filing household paperwork, taking the cat to the vet. Hell, even being friendly and sober in front of the neighbors and building positive relationships in the community.  I've been doing so much better at all that. 

And the stuff for ME. The stuff I do for ME includes: going to the gym, studying Spanish, reading novels, reading recovery and gardening books. Talking to my family and friends back home! Listening to music! Getting better at Super Smash Bros! More of all that, too. 

It feels like I'm finally working correctly again.

I thought hard about it and I have decided I am a long way away from being able to attend alcohol-fused parties. I’ve let my friends know I’m focusing on my health (I said I’m doing a cleanse), and I’m always up for hikes/walks. I feel a bit jealous that they can comfortably enjoy alcohol (most of them) without getting black out drunk. Some people can handle drinking, it’s just not for me. I am proud that I am setting myself up for success and consciously choosing the right path for me. Making the conscious choice on how to live my life, building a better future for myself, investing in myself is very empowering and I feel hopeful.

I am a bit anxious for the weekend to start and looking forward to being excited for weekends again. At least my job brings me structure and distracts me from my problems. :/

In November my wife was diagnosed with very rare stage IV cancer and has been going through chemo.   Obviously it’s been eating me up and survival rates are not good. 

Typical day_ Drinking starts with a pint after dropping off the kids, do bare minimum working from home, find next drink, sorta help wife with bedtime routine, then on to the couch downstairs to smoke myself until I pass out.  

That’s been the trend.   All intimacy, care, empathy, and general dad\work\and volunteer duties are always second to where the next drink comes.   

And all of this has been a secret.  People think I have my shit together.  Although work has suffered a,d there’s been a social stubble or two latterly that Have caused concern amongst friends. 

Rock bottom happened on Tuesday. 


On Tuesday 12pm I left to get a pint, and woke up in an abandoned dark neighborhood 30 miles from home.  

Yesterday I came clean to wife and some friends and I’m now on hour 48 of detox.  In hospital....

I plugged in my order, sent it on its merry way to Taco Bell through the magic of the internet, and waited patiently for my food to arrive. It was taking a little longer than usual to be picked up, but whatever - beggars can’t be choosers, amiright?

Eventually the food got here, so of course I scurried my way to the front door like the hungry little piggy I am. When I opened the door, though, I was shocked - instead of an adult human-sized portion, there were several large bags of food waiting for me. 

At this point, I assumed it was DoorDash making a mistake and delivering multiple orders to my front door. I searched through the bags, but could only find one receipt in my name. Upon reading through the receipt, however, I noticed a mistake - instead of giving me 10 fire sauces and 6 mild sauces, the TB cashier plugged in 10 gorditas and 6 Nachos Bellgrandes ($75ish worth of food, mind you). I quickly opened my DoorDash account and confirmed that it was a mistake on their end, not mine. 

Drunk me would have been elated at this mistake - a gift from the TB gods for this little piggy to indulge in all day long and into my drunken slumber. Instead, I am just flabbergasted. There is no way I am going to eat even a 5th of that today, it’s just not in me. And I don’t have anyone to share it with, unfortunately.

Oh, well. Out of all the sober problems I could have today, I’m glad it’s just way too much accidental Taco Bell.

I'm mostly just feeling very ""yay!"" about it and I'm actually looking forward to celebrating without alcohol. 

I've shared my choice to stop drinking with my family and close friends, but I'm considering sharing with my wider social media network on my birthday. My motivation to do this is twofold. One - I can rip the band-aid off, so to say, by sharing with everyone all at once. I'm hopeful this will give my friends and more distant family a heads up about my lifestyle change, and potentially prevent having to share that over and over as I start to see people again as vaccinations ramp up. Two - if anyone I know on social needs that little boost of inspiration in their own journey, I want them to know they aren't alone. 

I have a few concerns though. Social media is inherently a way for people to share the feel good, everything is perfect moments of their lives. While I see my 90 days of sobriety as something to celebrate, I'm not sure if the content is appropriate for what my contacts expect to see on social media. I'm also concerned it could be an overshare and I'm not wanting to feel like I'm airing my dirty laundry on the internet. I'm sure this concern has more to do with feeling vulnerable sharing my story, but it's still a concern either way. 

So...if you made it this far - does anyone have any experience, positive or negative, to share about choosing to share your sobriety on social media?

(Sung to the tune of ""Stayin' Alive..."")","I DID IT!  One year, 365 whole glorious days, and I feel so ALIVE.  I've thought all week (month) of how I would celebrate this, how I would commemorate this--it's so huge to me.  Last night, I opened and re-read a journal I started on Day 1, and how I was feeling--it's so touching, really to go back and re-read where I was and compare it to where I am today.

The night of April 1st a year ago--I had drank all day, pretty much.  Gin and tonics because it was warm out and I was bored and locked out of work, then vodka at official ""happy hour,"" then wine the rest of the night.  Picked a fight with my husband because he drinks too much (!!!!!).  It ended up in a short shoving match--we had never ever laid hands on each other or even been that angry, ever, in our long marriage.  Something snapped. My brain went, ""YOU need to stop.  YOU have a problem."" For some reason, I just knew I was done, even in my foggy state.  I woke up the next morning, took my laptop to the patio, and cried while I researched how to stop drinking.  I wrote on one support site that I felt like I was in mourning over losing something, and now I know--if there was mourning to be had, it was that it took me so long to finally know it was time to stop.

It was hard at first--I had to rearrange my day so I interrupted drinking hours, which had turned into about 3 in the afternoon until bedtime.  I took some great advice and ate really early, and found that helped immensely.  I read like it was my job, books like ""Alcohol Explained,"" ""Drinking, a Love Story,"" ""The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober"" (a big one and the first I read because how can that be?  Joy???  No way), walking and listening to ""We Are the Luckiest,"" (I still remember where I was in the neighborhood when certain passages were read), and a funny but powerful book ""The Sober Diaries.""  A line from the Sober Diaries about doing the hard work, and then not going back to do it again--kept me going so many times.  I took supplements and walked and walked, read and read, and put one foot in the front of the other every single day.  So many amazing realizations came, so many insights.  Drinking moments became thinking moments.  

A birthday.  A wedding. Visiting and staying with long-time drinking buddies at their lake house.  Holidays. All sober.  Sometimes hard, always woke up the next morning saying, ""WAHOO!  I did it!""  And now, here I am at today.  I am here, I am free, and I am fricking THRILLED that it's happened at long last.  I am moving forward into my future, and not away from my past.  I look so forward to the rest of my sober life.  I'm just in love with all of it right now, and thank you ALL for being here in this amazing space of care, help, understanding, and friendship.

In November last year, my girlfriend of 2 and a half years broke up with me. Even though I saw it coming, it still felt unexpected. I guess that's how it goes. I was devastated, because I lost an amazing girl, even though our views of the future were different and regardless if it happened earlier or later, I can bet it still would have happened.

On top of all that, I've been having health issues for more than 8 months for which I haven't found an answer for yet even though I've invested so much money in investigations and doctors. I'm still hanging on to the hope that maybe, just maybe I'll get to the bottom of this and recover, but I seriously can't imagine how things would have been if I would have kept drinking. I don't want to even think about it.

But here I am today, with more than 120 days in my pocket and it still feels so new. I do not miss the hangovers. On very few occasions, I felt like drinking, but rationalizing helped me take the higher road. I am not drinking mostly because I started to respect my body even more and I want to achieve full recovery, as health is my number one priority for the very first time, in more than a decade.

I am thinking of what to write and I remember thinking about how inspirational I'll be to someone else if I would have gotten sober. Truth is I don't feel very inspirational and as always, things are pretty different than what I imagine. Ironically, the hell I'm going through kept me far from drinking, so at least there's that.

I've been seeing a therapist which definitely helps. I came clean to her like two weeks ago and she thanked me for my honesty. It felt so good to tell someone about my struggle. She didn't judge me, she understood me and congratulated me for making this decision. It was one of the best things that happened to me.

I've always been a blackout drunk after 3 drinks. DUI a few years back. Ruined relationships. Never drank in the mornings, but still had abysmal work performance due to hangovers, and I was working in a professional environment making great money.

The beginning of the shutdown I remember the first thing I did was go to a liquor store (after leaving the bar where we were all watching the bar tv with rapt attention as the governor announced all non essential businesses would be closing that evening at 7pm) to get a bottle of whiskey because ""shit was getting real"" and we needed to have stuff on hand. After a few months of depression drinking white claws and becoming increasingly more depressed I had to stop. I don't even know how I did it because all of the other bad things I've done over the years should have made me say this was enough but it never was. It was just a day in July when I realized ""this constant cycle and feeling of guilt, regret, and shame will never leave until I make the choice to make it leave"" and I just stopped. I went through the initial waves of sobriety where all of the evil, horrible, embarrassing things that I did when I was drunk came flooding back. This lasted for weeks. Actually more like 2+ months. 

Then it turned to dreams. Dreams where I knew was sober, but then would all of a sudden find myself 5 drinks in and feeling violently out of control while being aware of it and being terrified. Or I'd suddenly find myself behind the wheel of a car careening down the highway at 70mph after drinking and I'd again be violently terrified knowing this isn't what I wanted to be doing. The dreams were so realistic it was scary. They finally went away though. After a long period of respite, I had one last night where I again knew I was sober but I was given a bottle of wine and opened it up and started drinking the whole thing even though in the dream I knew I did t want to. Somehow mid drink, I stopped, disgusted with myself and then poured the rest down the drain.

Ive gotten my first dose of the vaccine, and if I'm being honest - I've been extremely nervous about things opening back up and how strong I will be when I'm back around people and drinks. The saying ""you hang around a barbershop long enough, you're going to get a haircut"" is true. I don't plan on ""hanging out"" in bars at all, but there are some things in my line of work that will require me to go in bars and restaurants. I know I need to be strong. I know I need to think about every minute of the 266 days I have today. I know I needed to take inventory and write about this here, in a place where people will understand and see me checking myself.

january: 26/31 (5 days total drinking)

february: 22/28 (6 days total alcohol consumed however 2 of these days i only had two drinks and left it at that and did not get drunk... so this could be 24/28)

march: 28/31 (3 days total drinking)

so ive concluded that im making progress!! even though every time i give in to alcohol i feel like a failure and like none of my efforts matter, looking back i can see that i am making progress. i am also down by 8 lbs today! but thats also due to calorie counting and increasing daily walks. i have made better lifestyle changes and im feeling much better for it. 

looking back on october, november, and december i was drinking probably 7-10 days out of the month and felt like shit all the time. i really really do not want to go back to that. 

heres to hoping for dry april and to go beyond my 20 day streak.

2021-04-01 11:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/mhyddy/my_personal_experience_with_30_days_of_being/,My personal experience with 30 days of being sober - I did it yay,"I had set out in March to commit to staying sober and additionally to find better or healthier ways to cope with my depression. I know many of you on here have done this and are much more experienced, but I want to give some thoughts and encouragement for those who may be in the early stages like me. Or at least get my thoughts out even if no one reads this lol. 

This is not the first time I attempted to stay sober for 30 days. Since the pandemic had started, i had tried maybe 5-10 times. While I hadn't succeeded in doing 30 days, I had noticed the frequency with which I was not drinking was diminishing. For instance, before the pandemic, i would binge drink maybe twice a week. Then once I started becoming more aware and determined that I wanted to make a change, this gradually became once every two weeks or so. But really committing to 30 days was a long process, one I didn't succeed at many times but slowly made my way to finally getting to. 

Because this was a long process developing before I started this recent 30 days, I had identified some other behaviors or supplements that would help me with staying sober. 

One was exercise, because I also have had a goal to get in shape and lose weight during the pandemic. This one helped me stay focused because I knew drinking would undo a lot of the work I put in as well as make me too hungover / depressed to continue with my goal. Committing to a goal where I was dedicated to seeing results helped and also because this had been something I was actively working on for months, I also saw the times I drank would negatively impact that goal. I track my weight loss and exercise on an app and can see easily the months where I drank heavily would also make me not reach my goals for that month. This last month I spent not drinking, I lost 4 pounds (more than I've lost in any month so far) got about 80,000 steps a week, and can see a visible difference in my stomach bloat. Exercise has also been good for my depression and anxiety which in turn makes me less likely to want to drink.

Speaking of depression and anxiety, these have been big contributors with my drinking. This was possibly the most difficult part because these are such huge triggers for me, but I had to keep drilling to myself that drinking would just worsen these symptoms. This month, I'll be honest, there were some really tough days with my depression. And also these were the days I struggled the most to not drink. This time I spent sober also caused me to actually have to wrestle and sit with some horrible symptoms. And you hear that's important to do this so you can continue to work on yourself but it felt damn near impossible at times. 

In fact, the first day I had one of these really horrible depression spells, I actually did end up getting a drink. I felt powerless to not have one. And my immediate reaction was to shame myself for failing, but now I think it was actually a good thing. For one, there was a lot of pushback in me to not keep going and I attribute that to all the work I had put in prior to that slip up. Additionally, I didn't want to see it as a reason for failure because that has always caused me to downslide into even worse territory. This time, I said it's ok and kept going with my commitment. I still count my time as 30 days because March has 31 days and I committed all of the other days to staying sober. 

My other trigger for drinking which has been less challenging due to the pandemic is the social anxiety aspect. This is one I hope to commit to more this summer when I am put in more social situations. I am lucky that in a way, I haven't had to worry about this stressor and I honestly think it was something that held me back from committing to being sober for a long time before the pandemic. I always wanted to drink in any social situation, and couldn't relax until I was drunk. 

Last were a few resources I used such as Annie grace's alcohol experiment book which was absolutely instrumental since it goes through 30 days. I also read ""quit like a woman"" which I thoroughly enjoyed but it may not be for everyone. I am hoping to find some more relatable resources this coming month. 

So moving forward, I am trying to evaluate month by month on where I stand. In April, I would like to continue to 60(ish) days. But I would also like to dive deeper into dissecting the aspects of staying sober that made March challenging. That means continuing to actively challenge my depression, going easy on myself, having a goal (exercise-related) and starting to process some social anxiety bits and pieces. Anyway I know this is a tldr but I feel good getting it off my chest and I hope anyone who's in a similar situation can find ways to continue to feel better mentally and physically like I am.",13,{'pandemic': 5},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.546955}"

I kept popping melatonin so I could finally fall asleep and it gave me crazy nightmares. I woke up feeling groggy--but not hungover.

Another similar situation is if for whatever reason I couldn't make it to the liquor store before they close, I don't struggle throughout the night because it's simply not an option. the main problem I have is when I tell myself in the morning that I am not going to drink that night, I actually believe it. Then at about 4:00 every day I start to get this feeling that is almost like FOMO but with drinking. Like, ""well of course I'm going to drink tonight, I will cook some good food and have a night of it."" Once that thought appears, and it does every day unless it is like one of the nights I mentioned before, I am basically hopeless.

Been sober about as many days as I haven’t in 2021 starting with a dry January followed by a couple benders, buncha panic attacks and a psychotic break, finally having my last medicinal beer to defeat withdrawal on the 15th of March. Living alone, working night shift in a tumultuous long distance relationship that is now up in the air at best, or perhaps never to cross paths again with no contact til I get my life under control. 37 years old, drinking almost nightly for 20 years. I’ve found I have the most amazing support group including a family who have allowed me to stay on their couch in my early recovery. The Dad is an old friend, Mom is a bulldog, the teenager is awkward but helpful an I have eggs every morning with the little one who is so bizarre and spritely that my shitty mood, when I’m sad and angry after work, disappears. He once asked me during my breath work if I was ok and I said “no, but I am going to be” An informal rehab of sorts. I’ve been working every possible method to recover, exercise, 12 step, therapy, meetings, meditation and journaling. I know I am strong and may not need all of these but it’s better to have anyways. I am grateful for every day, every moment to be healing and taking this journey. I’ve found that without the ability to tune out, I only want to zone in! I’ve set no boundaries about MJ and video games but I’ve lost interest in favor of putting useful stuff in my head. My mantra in the 1st week was that of Winston Churchill, “what do you do when you’re going through hell? You keep going” Now the awesome part, I’ve been feeling more like a team player at work and last night got my picture taken to be put on the wall as EOTM!

I’ve found through caving and(bawling my eyes out)admitting that I can’t manage my own life alone, (as Mr Rodgers put it) the helpers, in addition to pushing out the haters. In addition to these awesome people I’ve been doing Wim Hof’s breathing exercises and cold showers to really kick my lizard, addicted mind’s ass. To show it who’s boss and know that even in supreme discomfort that I am in control and will live my life in the way my prefrontal cortex and my soul have agreed upon! Another excellent tool I’ve not seen mentioned here is Russel Brand’s Recovery: Freedom from our addictions. It’s the perfect humorous, atheistic introduction to the 12 steps. I’ve beat the shit out of my dopamine receptors for decades and it will take so much work to climb this mountain to recovery, but I am infinitely grateful to simply have the chance. 16 days towards a better life.

Upon googling, these shirts are available with many different kinds of alcohol, not just crown. They are clearly knock off/rip off brands, nothing licensed (I wonder why?). 

I asked about the shirt, saying “so, we’re pandering alcohol to children now?” 

The response:
“It’s not really a kids movie.” 

🤦‍♀️ Seriously? Am I missing something here?

(And for reference, this person has a 10 year old child.)

After reading “This Naked Mind”, shit like this really puts our alcohol culture into perspective. 1600 days has shown me how interconnected and practically forced it is into every facet of our lives. Now dumbasses go out of their way to design stuff I’m sure Disney knew better than to. There was no second thought, nothing that told his brain, “Hey, maybe this gives the wrong impression to children”.  The immediate response was defense and ignorance. 

Look it up if you’d like, but I won’t give Amazon the clicks by linking it. I just thought it was ridiculous. 

Anyways, what questionable alcohol merchandise have you guys seen?

A few years ago, I was working a job with little oversight. It sent me out into the city, talking to people, exploring, and seeing what was happening. My favorite place to do that was from inside a bar.

One Friday morning, after a raucous evening during which I passed out on a friend's couch and forgot to call my wife, I woke up and booked it straight to a dive bar. I caught a buzz, did some work, and then went to the next pub. After failing to lock down any sort of upper, I figured, ""Fuck it. Let's just keep going and hope for the best.""

Eventually, in the late afternoon, I was stumbling toward the train station when I felt sick. The city was spinning. My head was floating. My stomach was in revolt.

Suddenly, I puked on the sidewalk, in broad daylight, as commuters and students and professionals and regular fucking people passed. The vomit covered the right arm of my winter jacket, and my breath smelled lethal. I was in no condition to catch my train home.

A man who was experiencing homelessness came up to me. I'd seen him around and dropped a few bucks in his lap in the past. He was shocked, almost disgusted, as he helped clean me up. But he was also gracious and so kind. He wasn't trying to judge me at all.

He left me with these words: ""I've been there, man. Help is out there. Go get it.""

Later, after I sobered up, this interaction became a joke. My friends and I laughed about it.

A few months on, and I finally admitted that my drinking had grown too osbcene, too reckless, too feral. I began experimenting with sobriety. It took a while to make meaningful progress, but I stuck with it, in fits and starts. Now, I'm confident that I'm in control of my life.

But I never forgot that man. Even as he struggled to eke out a life on the streets, he made the effort to care for and guide me. I thanked him once during an early sober streak, but I'd like to do so again if I'm ever back in town. It's eye-opening when someone so down on their luck pities you.

I’m a 31yo French and I have been drinking since I am 19 or so. 
I am an evening drinker and can drink a whole bottle of whisky or a whole bottle of wine and a few glasses of whisky. I can spend sometimes 2 or 3 days without drinking but I keep getting back to it.
Last year I managed to stay away from alcohol for something like 3 weeks and I was really proud and feeling good (I was doing meditation and sport too). For a reason I can’t explain I started again while the harder part seemed behind me and despite I knew for years I had a problem with it.
Today I feel it’s destroying my relationship with my 8 years long girlfriend with whom I own a restaurant (which is closed atm due to the pandemic) and I am getting close to losing her.
She has been extremely patient but I understand she can’t take it anymore and can’t imagine herself build a long term life with an alcoholic.
Most of the time I drink out of boredom (I have the habit of being stimulated since I am 15 with weed) or because I feel deeply uncomfortable or depressed. I have often a dark opinion on what’s happening in the world and concerning humans in general, which I cannot really tell if it’s lucidity or alcoholism related or a mix of both. I would like to stop again and would love to hear from people with the same profile that managed to quit. 
I am considering of having a last booze tonight but tell my girlfriend I will try to stop after and will give her my credit card so I can’t buy anymore. Feels like a really bad idea when I am writing this but I hope to hear your opinion.

I would talk about her all the time when sober but I wasn’t being as truthful as I could’ve been with my partner. I would yell when I was drunk that I wish he’d ask more about her, but he can’t read my mind. We’ve grown so much stronger since I’ve stopped relying on alcohol to communicate my emotions. And I’m learning to face things instead of escaping. 

Man. I can’t believe it’s been 2 years. I miss her everyday and so many things remind me of her every day. I feel so much more peace this year than last year and it makes me so hopeful for the future. My family can adapt to our new normal. Perhaps it’s weird to say but stopping drinking has been similar to the grieving process. It’s worth mentioning that therapy also was the biggest support system I had navigating my grieving process (that will last the rest of my life). No 2 paths looks the same. Easily the most important piece of advice. 

I’ve been able to reconnect on a stronger level with my moms birth mom who is an AA queen. I recommended the book Quit Like A Woman to her and she loved it! I’m thankful I have her to lean on if I need it. It’s difficult creating that relationship with a relative in my late twenties but I’m thankful. 

If anyone’s lost a loved one on a holiday (April fools is minor, I know), it’s tough. Especially on one that is only about jokes! My mom was hilarious, though. Her favorite show before she passed was marvelous mrs maisel. I just wanted to put it out there that I wouldn’t be in the state of mind today without making the decision to not drink, which wouldn’t have been possible without this community. Maybe tomorrow looks differently though and that’s okay too. 💗

Hi everyone. The past 3 days I’ve been in a really bad mood.  It’s not hormones. It could be stress but honestly it’s all just say in day out stuff.  More good is happening than bad. Maybe it’s the rain.  Maybe it’s the free time (work closed for holiday). Maybe it’s boredom. Maybe it’s fear of socializing after everyone gets vaccinated. Maybe it’s the price of tea in China. 

I won’t have a drink although ain’t gonna lie - it’s crossed my mind. 

I have heard people talk about growing pains and mood swings and random bursts of feeling like they are triggered hard core.

now im at 3 weeks and have no cravings.

since ive stopped drinking, ive lost 20 pounds and got a promotion...

Ended up with me just drinking all the time, all day and somehow being able to keep a job.  However during that time I treated my wife like absolute shit.  I had my good times, but they probably didn't outweigh my bad.

Anyways, fast forward to August of last year.  On vacation, wife said 'you think maybe you can drink just moderate?'.  I said absolutely not, but 15 minutes later I did start.   And since then its been every day.  First it was 'we'll only drink together' to me drinking behind her back, and due to WFH me starting drinking at 3pm instead of when she gets off at 5pm.   So yeah, progressed back pretty quickly.

Anyways, Sunday I went through her email.. which I never do, something just said to do it.   I found a very personal email to her ex (we've been married 7 years).  There was no pics or sexual talk but it was very personal and could be perceived as emotional cheating... This email was from back in October.   I lost my shit, literally.    So I went on a 3 day bender, which obviously didn't help.  

So now I'm dealing with 2 things, #1 Trying to deal with this issue with my wife.  Honestly I've done something like it but it was at the first of my marriage.. I just didn't get caught.. nothing physical but could be considered very inappropriate for a married man.  #2 I stopped drinking again, I'm on day two.   So depression for both of them right now. 

I got about 4 hours of sleep last night, and I feel very foggy at work which is stressing me out because I'm in a very high-level position and need to be alert and executing.    I've spoken to my wife and feel we're going to be able to get through this.   It was a lapse in judgment as she was not happy with our marriage and she regrets it.  I do not think anything happened as the guy didn't even respond and she has no history of this type of thing before.   So we just need to work through it.  I signed up for therapy starting next week, hopefully, that helps.

I’ve been thinking about loss a lot lately. About the ending of my own little world that I inhabit, or maybe just a particular version of that world. I suppose I’m always in the grip of loss, always grieving the absence of this or that person, place, thing, my not too distant youth. You could say I’m a mournful person. SO much so that I can tell you confidently that there’s no such thing as stages to proceed through when grieving. There’s a sadness to me that I can’t conceal because its always in my eyes. Even when I’m not sad. But all this despair, if you’d call it that, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I think my acquaintance with loss has made me more appreciative of the now, more alive to the vitality of the present, because I’m painfully aware of the impermanence of everything. Better take it all in because it will be gone. And soon. 

I’ve been feeling that sense of loss more intensely because I no longer can see my young boys every day. Every other weekend. Some weekdays. A couple of weeks ago I wrote about how I was spending my last full week with them. I wish I had always been as attentive as I was during those final days. I’ve never clutched tighter. It was like everything about them, every little detail, was heightened. Their bodies. Their voices. Their eyes. It was all so much, almost too much, to take in. Sensory overload. Now I’m vacant, blank with my tattered heart and sad eyes. 

I had quit drinking to avoid just this feeling. But it didn’t work, wasn’t enough to salvage the thing that needed to be saved to prevent this loss. I’m not bitter though. Maybe regretful that I didn’t stop sooner, because not drinking brought me so much closer to them. And I couldn’t bear the thought of still drinking, of never stopping, and still ending up in this spot. Because then I would’ve squandered that much more time. I said it here before: there’s never enough time. Its always running out.  

Patience. It really is a virtue. I’m learning this reluctantly. It’s interesting that patience derives from the Latin word for suffering. I’m looking it up now. “The capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering.” But to do so “without getting angry or upset.” Sounds daunting. But I will try. I’m trying to remember what the poet John Keats said about this. Something like having the ability to accept the loss of self and the imaginative capacity to understand that you can reinvent yourself. Forge a new self out of the remains of the world you’ve lost. 

Jesus: “Lose yourself to find yourself.” I’m not religious but I’ve always liked this. 

And that’s what I’m going to do. Practice patience. Be thankful for the time I’ve had and believe that I’ll have more times ahead to be thankful for. To tolerate this loss and move on from this broken world of mine to new beginnings, to new selves. An ending. A bereavement. An unmooring. What’s out there waiting for me? I can’t wait to find out.",24,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46692428}"

In all it was very helpful, though I didn't respond to things everyone who responded had great wisdom to share and it all helped me out tremendously in reducing my anxiety.

I was only in treatment for 45 days, but those 45 were some of the most enjoyable and life-changing I've experienced in a long time. I laughed, cried, and overall *felt* more strongly and sincerely than I had in a long, long time, and I did it all without numbing myself with booze. I made friends, learned skills, and rediscovered hobbies and interests of mine that had been put on the sidelines by alcohol. Those 45 days were the longest I had gone without drinking in almost a decade, and it was glorious.

I would be almost 2 1/2 months sober today, and I say ""would be"" because I unfortunately relapse shortly after leaving treatment. At first, I was ashamed and angry at myself, and the original worries that I was just broken and unfixable started to creep in. Then, though, I did something I never did before: I owned up to it and told people. 

I told my partner, who instead of being angry or disappointed (like I was worried they would be), they just wanted to make sure I was okay and safe. I told my IOP group who were supportive and walked me through my thoughts and actions that led to my relapse, helping me analyze it and build a plan to prevent future relapses. I told some friends from treatment who reminded me that I am NOT my addiction, and that I am an amazing human being who is allowed to make mistakes sometimes, and that by owning up to it I was already taking steps in the right direction

A year ago I never would have said a thing. I would have hated myself, and then continued to drink to try, and fail, to cover shame and disappointment in myself. I didn't do that this time, though, and today I am two weeks sober since my relapse. I may have had to reset the clock, but I *did* reset it, and I'm still trying, and this time I'm going to do better. This time I'm going to get to get to 3 months, and keep going from there. And if I relapse again, well, then I'll reset the clock and try again, and again, and again if I have to, as many times as I need to, because I AM NOT my addiction, and as long as I continue to remember that I have friends, loved ones, and support I can do this. Today is another day, and *I will not drink today*. Once I do that, then I'll do it again tomorrow.

I want to thank this community for giving me the courage I needed to go through with treatment, because if I didn't have that I'd likely be half in the bag right now, and I cannot stress how happy am that I'm not!",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.72513145}"

I found myself do this about 4 times yesterday, just stop and think oh my goodness how good is this, I'm sober. I felt so nice. 
Ofcourse I was a bit restless yesterday afternoon because my house was a mess and the sun was shining, usually I would have stressed and raced to do a half assed job of cleaning my house so I could sit in the backyard drinking wine and pretending I had it all together.
But instead I just did a half assed job of cleaning and then made a huge pasta, drank some iced tea and just felt content. I didn't feel any guilt or stress or pressure to do anything so that I could justify to myself why I'm about to absolutely fuuck myself up. 

Nice to not be fucking abusing myself.

A few hours ago, it was announced that Ontario (in Canada) was going into a state of lockdown for the third time since last March. The previous two times, my mental health was pretty abysmal and I was drinking habitually. 

I am not an essential employee, so I have been laid off every time that we have entered lockdown. Without a sense of work related routine, I found myself deciding very frequently that there was no reason not to drink heavily on a given day. It got to the point that I was drinking heavily almost any day that I was not ridiculously hungover.

Right now, I am on Day 18 of my decision not to drink and it has been going really well. I feel like I'm finally getting into a good head space. I have quit smoking, ate healthier, lost weight, spent time learning to cook, and worked extra so that I would have funds saved up for future lockdowns. I have positive momentum and I want to keep it going.

But with the announcement of a lockdown, I find myself feeling anxious and afraid. I do not want this to be the reason that I give in and fall into my old habits of binge drinking. There is a little voice in the back of my head is whispering to me that this lockdown will be my downfall. But fuck that!

I have decided that I would like to make a commitment to myself and everyone on this sub that I am not going to let this lockdown get the best of me. The lockdown is daunting, but I've been through it two times before so I know the challenges that the lockdown is going to throw at me - I am familiar with the loneliness, boredom and monotony that I am going to experience. I see no reason to add shame and regret to the challenges I am going to face during the next month. 

I feel like the best way to move forward is to create a plan. Right now, the plan that I think I am going to move forward with will involve checking this subreddit with increased frequency, continuing practicing and improving at cooking, getting exercise through biking, and attempting to learn some of the fundamentals of coding (so that perhaps I might move to an essential career down the line).

If other people have ideas for proactive steps that I can take to help me get through this lockdown and end up in a better place, I would greatly appreciate hearing them.

Additionally, if there are other people here who are feeling anxious/nervous about the incoming lockdown in Ontario, perhaps we can try to lift each other up through this time and provide each other with a form of accountability.

I would have done it as a way of trying to deal with my feelings of exhaustion and being overwhelmed, but with a clear mind I was able to understand how it would have made both of those things worse, not better. 

That was when I decided to treat myself to extra sleep instead, and I skipped my morning workout to get the rest my body and brain needed. It was such a brilliantly effective substitution that I can’t believe I never thought of it before. Just as gratifying as drinking would have been, only it actually nourishes my mind/body/soul instead of just soothing it.

I’m realizing I was the one pushing people to their limits with alcohol and extra curricular activities. I was the one pushing them to stay up all night, pushing for the day 2, pushing for the wild night, pushing for “just one more drink with me”

Thursday - Unrealized support

&#x200B;

Like a base of a broadcast tower.

I work at a broadcast facility.  I’m in the engineering department that maintains operations of two radio stations and a tv station.  I’ve been in this business for 18 years and I’ve seen electronic wonders that have kept me fascinated the entire time I’ve worked here.

But there is one “wonder” of my career that has captivated my interest the most.  No one ever talks about it, even my peers don’t have an interest in it.  It’s a mystery to them except for the designers and engineers that fabricate it.

It’s the tower.  Those tall lonely structures out there in the corn field with their alternating colors of aviation orange and white during the day and blinking their red beacon lights silently near the horizon in the night when you are traveling out of town.

That tower is 1000 feet tall.  It has three faces with three legs.  Triangular shaped.  Consider the guy cables keeping it steady.  Six levels of guy cables pulling down on the tower.  Consider how much it weighs.  All of it.

I don’t know how much it is but a conservative guess would be somewhere in the order of 300 - 400 tons.  The very bottom of the tower where all of the weight is at its greatest, it comes to a point.  That’s right!!  The three legs of the tower are bent inwards to form a point.  This point is small enough that you can get your arms around it.

It blows my mind to know that the entirety of its structure rests on a point no larger than something you can hug.

Sometimes support is there and you don’t even know it.  For me, it is a co-worker that shared our struggles with substance abuse a few years ago.  Every now and then she will text me to see how I’m doing.  She knows of my struggles and she checks up on me and sometimes I forget that she’s there because our messages are very far and few.  But when she does reach out, I feel very loved at that moment.  Much love to my friend.

Should you choose to answer, I would love to hear any stories you have of support that may seem small but was there all along.

Have a good April day and watch out for the tricksters today!!  ;)

I will not be drinking with you this tricky day!!!
