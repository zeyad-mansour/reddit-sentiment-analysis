I love how clear-headed I've been and how in tune with myself I am. However, I must admit there is a loneliness, a solitude that comes with this detox. I read a meme that I screenshotted the other day that read: ""The price of loneliness is the knowledge of ourselves."" This hit home for me. I also had a conversation with a longtime friend of mine, where we both agreed it felt lonely the more in tune we became. Why is that? Why does it feel lonely in the midst of so much necessary unveiling? I can't help but question if I will feel this loneliness always, or if I just programmed myself to feel lonely the deeper I go within myself. The self-discoveries, the revelations of my own toxicity are not easiest to talk about with just anyone. Especially when you are starting to zoom out of your reality to gain perspective on your life and those you allow to be a part of it. Doing my work on myself triggers those I love most. My family, my closest friends. They tell me life is not that deep and I should just enjoy it.

Enjoy life yes, but how I enjoy it is changing for me now. I don't have to binge drink on the weekends with family in order to enjoy my life. Hell, I've come to realize I don't have to drink at all really to enjoy life. This has been a huge awakening! I'm proud of my ability to stay sober in social settings. I'm proud of the reassurance and confidence I feel without using alcohol as a crutch. Staying firm about my choices right now is of the utmost importance. I'm not saying that I will never have a drink again, I'm sure I will. But the amount of clarity I have gained within these past 46 days has been amazing! I can't go back to habits and situations that are not going to help me evolve. I have to remind myself why I  decided to move forward and start this process. I started because I am tired of my own BS!! and I want to truly love myself! I want to consistently love myself madly! I want to live a life of love, full and abundant. I want to tap into my highest self every day. That is what this is all about and I will not stop until I am walking in my truth, my light, my love!",17,0

It‚Äôs really just another mask for now, because I know that my next step is going to be allowing it all to pour free. I need to cry. I need to scream. I need to let myself be angry, be sad, be vulnerable. Alcohol enabled me to hold it all in. It allowed me to ignore the dark cloud of chaos that hovers over me created over a lifetime of trauma. It allowed me to continue smiling when faced with the mirror of my own misery. It allowed me to say that everything is fine, that I don‚Äôt need any help, and to think I‚Äôm stronger than I‚Äôm given credit for, because I‚Äôm able to deal with my shit on my own.

Side Note: my childhood best friend works for the same company as me. She was a heroin addict for years and thankfully has not used in some time. It was during her addiction that I also struggled with my own addiction with xanax and alcohol. She made a comment to me several months ago something along the lines of ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre not actually an addict/alcoholic, you just do AA because it makes you feel good‚Äù. It really hurt me and made me feel unseen. Perhaps my rock bottom was not as intense as hers, but I still suffered in my own illness.

This is the first time I've ever actually taken a - I guess, a formal step to stop drinking. I have a big enough problem to where I need support, which I never wanted to admit even to myself. But I think I have to, finally.

Long story short(ish) - I have three little boys. I'm a nurse and lost my job at the hospital after working through the first six months of Covid because my longtime childcare provider dropped us. The other parents were scared of my exposure to Covid patients. It caused my husband and I a lot of financial and emotional strain.

I began to feel depressed and hopeless, and I tried to get into counseling but so was everyone else in the world and I couldn't get in anywhere I tried. My drinking, which had always been a part of my life, began to worsen. I developed a dependency, drinking to cope and then feeling bad about it and then drinking more to stop feeling bad. A vicious cycle. 

Finally, a couple of months ago, my mom got unexpectedly diagnosed with terminal cancer. She was gone within 30 days. I was shattered - again. It felt like the final nail in my coffin, too. I am not suicidal or anything but I've gone on several benders since and if I don't do something now, I'm afraid of what will happen.

I don't have any alcohol in the house right now. There was a bottle of wine leftover from a party we had the other night and I dumped it down the sink. I want out of this cycle. I have to be better for my husband and kids - and for myself. I want healthier ways to cope. 

If you've read through this novel of a post, thank you so much. I'm hoping I can get support here as I start down the path. I KNOW I can do it. I've done it before, obviously, when pregnant - but that was with a mitigating factor motivating me.

What's more is my doctor that I thought had all my meds squared away called me and doesn't want to see me anymore because I moved, and was seeing other doctors that prescribed me other medications that he isn't comfortable with. I thought he wouldn't see me again due to missing too many appointments, so I tried to find another doctor where I had moved to.. He says he will prescribe my anxiety meds for 3 months more but won't prescribe my ADHD meds like I was prescribed by other doctors. He was extremely suspect and told me to get another doctor ASAP. I hope that it won't be as hard with this doctor backing me when it comes to staying on the medication but I'm freaking out about it all.

My husband and I share this car, and he loved it so much and it's totaled now. I know better than to drink and drive, I am sitting here in shame and regret over doing that. I know it's just a car and a material possession, but the guilt is really really heavy right now about the loss of it. It had a lot of sentimental value for my husband. I haven't drank since that day, and I don't have plans to, but I still feel just as guilty and ashamed at myself as I did that day. It's not the first time I've done that, I just always made it home.

No particular reason other than the ol‚Äô ‚Äúget out of your home state and experience life‚Äù thing. So far it‚Äôs been a different challenge everyday and somehow it all comes back to alcohol. 

After being a very heavy drinker for the last 10 years(at least 15 beers a day, sometimes more) I had finally quit drinking for just over 2 months. The night we moved in, we celebrated with a bottle of champagne that my aunt had gotten me for Christmas. For about 3-4 months after that, I‚Äôd regularly drink. Sometimes just a 6er at night or maybe 10 beers spread out a day. Usually pints. So maybe more. 

Over the last couple months I‚Äôve managed to moderate that into once a week. Maybe twice. Sometimes even taking a break for a couple weeks. Over the last week tho I‚Äôve been having trouble keeping myself occupied in order to subdue the cravings. Unfortunately, it constantly leaves me in a state of anxiety and cloudiness. I don‚Äôt drink to get drunk, but only to pass the time and keep me interested in basic activities (yard work, cleaning etc). Although I always end up drunk considering how much I always end up drinking. 

It doesn‚Äôt help that one of my roommates is  a daily drinker(tho he doesn‚Äôt really have an actual substance problem.) The issue with him is that his daily drinking is very light and he can‚Äôt handle more than a few hard ciders but continues to believe he‚Äôs a hard boozer. It kind of offends me that he thinks of addiction as an image and flex when there are ppl like me that have struggled for years with substance abuse. He thinks drinking a few hard ciders a day makes him tough yet 10-12 beers a day makes me feel weak. None the less he‚Äôs a good guy. Just very confused and very uninformed. 

The reason I‚Äôm here is to seek out any advice to help me push through the cravings and condescending energy that lead me to the store. I have ADHD and ADD so video games are very hard to play longer than maybe an hour. I used to draw and paint a lot but that was fueled by alcohol almost entirely.

I recently moved into a new place, ended up boating with a friend- drank way too much on an empty stomach (we missed dinner cause of engine trouble so got stuck on the water). Sat out with some new neighbors and made a complete a$$ out of myself. Just taking over the conversation, talking about politics, asking personal questions ... I only was out there for about 25 minutes but I made an IMPRESSION let me tell you.  I went back inside, woke up mortified, left them a note with a nice bottle of wine (that morning I decided I'm off the wagon figured it best to get rid of it - win win ).

I wanted to get my story off my chest.,"It has been 102 days since the last time I touched a drop of alcohol. 14 weeks and 4 days without a drink. It feels... strange.

Starting in September of 2020, I started drinking to self-medicate my depression/anxiety (and ADHD, as I'd find out almost a year later).  I had always been a heavy drinker at parties, but never like this. I used to blackout because I *wanted to*. But last year, I started blacking out because I *had to.*

When I started, I would finish work (from home of course, because COVID) and immediately crack open a beer. It would start with one, then go all the way up to 6 for the first month or so. But I quickly realized that six-packs weren't cutting it. Soon enough, I was buying and drinking at least 12 beers/seltzers a day. Eventually, I graduated to liquor. Over the next couple months of misery and sickness, I would down at least 375mL of vodka *on top of* the 6-12 beers I was drinking *every single day.*

Obviously I started feeling like garbage, but at that point I couldn't stop. From the moment I woke up to the moment I passed out, the only thing on my mind was when I would get my next drink. I pushed away family, I borrowed from friends, I even went days eating only chips and chocolate because I would rather have used my money for booze instead of real food. By 2021, I was routinely drinking upwards of 25 standard drinks per day.

This all came to a head in March of this year. I hit a wall and I could barely pull myself out of bed anymore. And when I did, the first thing I'd do was pour myself a drink so I could live with myself. I was regularly calling ambulances to avoid killing myself in drunken despondency. This eventually lead to a psychiatrist appointment which landed me in the psych ward. My first night there, I drank hand sanitizer just to get a buzz. A few days later, I was strapped down to a table and fed pills so I wouldn't keep trying to slit my wrists with random scraps of sharpened plastic on the floor. It was fucking *hell.*

I grew so resentful of everyone in my life. My family, my friends, my therapist and ***ESPECIALLY*** the doctors. I spent the last week or two in the hospital presenting a smile to anyone who came by, all the while plotting how I'd bounce back into my old ways once I got released. *""I'll show them,""* I thought. *""They'll see what happens when they* ***force*** *me to get help.""*

And show them I did.

When I was released, I spent another month getting drunk as a skunk. I had quit my job and depleted my savings. So all I could afford to do was sit around and drink 5 dollar, 12% Molson Drys until I puked my guts up or passed out. I was the worst I'd ever been. I was sick, I was lonely, and most of all, I was ***angry.***

And then one day... I just stopped. I woke up with the worst hangover of all time and I just... decided not to keep going. I looked over at the door and prepared to walk to the liquor store, but I didn't. The hangover was simply too strong for me to even face the cold light of day. So I popped a few leftover valium and hunkered down.

That first week was the stuff of legend. Just being miserable 24/7, unable to sleep, unable to eat, unable to smile... all the while knowing that my salvation was waiting in the beer fridge in the store just across the street. I felt like I was trapped in purgatory, just waiting for the moment when I'd cave. But as of today, that moment hasn't come.

Today is my birthday. I'm on vacation with my family, and the hotel's stocked mini-bar is staring me in the face as I type this. And while I still feel like a suicidal piece of garbage, I'm **god damned PROUD of myself** for not touching it.

See, quitting drinking didn't make me a better person. It didn't turn my life around. I still don't have energy, I still don't want to work and I still barely even want to live. But the point is that I ***am*** better than I used to be. Things still aren't good, but they are *better.*

What keeps me going strong is thinking about just how terrible things *could* be. I think about all the bullshit I go through on a daily basis, how many times I contemplate suicide, how many times I lock myself in a bathroom and cry my eyes out. But then I think about how much worse all of that would be if I was either too drunk or too hungover to even look my problems in the face.

When I was admitted to the psych ward, I had reached the pinnacle of my mental health issues. I was drinking so that I could keep my head down and not acknowledge the wall until I had already hit it. And that wall was as real as anything. When I completely gave up, I lost everything. I lost my apartment, I lost my job, and I lost my will to live.

Now, I feel myself going down the same path. That wall is still there, present as ever. But this time, I'm looking straight at it. I can see it coming, and I have a clear enough mind to at least consider my options. And while I still may not do anything about it, I know that it's *possible* to avoid the wall. That's the difference between me when I'm drinking, and me when I'm not. I can look at the scars at my arms, the shitty state of my life, my rapidly declining physical health... and still have hope. I can see a way out where I couldn't before.

I'm not doing great. I'm not doing good. Hell, I'm not even doing *okay.* But I sure as shit am doing *better.* And that's all I can really ask for.

Alcohol is like an abusive ex that won't stop calling me. I remember all the good times we had, all the moments where the bottle was there for me when nobody else was. I remember how good it made me feel, and how easy it'd be to let it back into my life. But I also remember the horrific pain and suffering it put me through. And now that I've spent some time away from it, I know that I can find those good times somewhere else. So as long as I don't pick up that call, there's still opportunity for me to improve.

By quitting drinking, I feel as though I've set up a buffer for myself, like [a train nearing the end of the tracks](https://www.klosegmbh.de/eng/images/pro/1.jpg). No matter how shitty things get, no matter how rough the path ahead seems, I know I won't end up flying off the rails. And in a world where the end seems to be getting closer and closer, I'm glad that I have the chance to take action before I get there.

Today, I am 20 years old, and I'm still alive. I'm not locked in a hospital, and I'm not in the back of an ambulance with bandaids all over my arms.

I am not sure why I waited so long to post here but I guess today was the day. When I was on the fence this is one of the places I came for some.... answers? Advice? Proof that I was an alcoholic? I am not really sure. All I know is I was looking down the barrel. I knew the way I was living was not sustainable. I was unhappy, depressed and scared. I didn't know what to do. I knew for a very long time that the way I drank wasn't healthy or normal. The truth is the alternative didn't sound any better. I was scared all the time. I had anxiety, self hatred and self pity out the wazoo. The only thing I had was alcohol. I couldn't fathom having that taken away. Then a miracle happened. I hit my bottom. Got in trouble at work one too many times then went to rehab to save that and when I got home was immediately arrested for DWI. My wife kicked me out, I was positive I lost my job, I had no license and I hated my self. From that came the realization that if I wanted to live I had to try something new. Most of all I had to admit that I didn't have answers and that I needed to listen to others. My journey involved a lot of different groups and people but the thing that made it possible for me was the idea of one day at a time. Just don't drink today. No matter what just make it through today. With that also comes the fact that you only have today. You cant change yesterday. My past actions don't go away and I need to face the consequences for my actions BUT I cant change it. It happened. I need to live for 24 hours at a time and do my best. I also can't predict the future. I found that if I just do my best for 24 hours, don't drink and do the right thing my past actions don't sting as much. They don't have the power they once did. The future is bright. I believe that is from doing the best I can for one day at a time. I had a long journey and I just had my license reinstated. My wife took me back and we are stronger than ever. I was able to keep my job and I am thriving. My friends and family look at me in a different light. My father has said multiple times that I am like a different person (I believe that's because I am). My wife and I are even trying for a child now. that is something that I couldn't fathom just two years ago. All of these blessing don't come close to one gift I have been given in sobriety: I am happy. I never thought I could live a life with out alcohol. A bottle of vodka at the end of the day was all I had to look forward to for a very long time. I don't need that anymore. I am grateful for my life now. It will not always be sunshine and rainbows but that's okay. Because no matter what happens I learned in the past 20 months that I will survive. I will be okay. Before, I was a lurker on this sub and I thought you were all full of shit, but in the back of my mind I prayed you weren't. Now I am one of the ones saying life is good. Thank god I was wrong. Life really does get better. Just go one day at a time and I believe you will see. I will not drink you you today my friends.",1,0

Headline should have read: My stomach does not like coffee without food. 

I sat down to eat and felt seriously queasy, knowing I needed to eat but also feeling sick at the idea of eating. Seriously stared at my plate thinking, ""EAT NOW just do it!"" while my stomach rebelled and roiled at the thought. 

And then I realized, ""F\*\*\*in A I used to feel WORSE than this on the regular when I was drinking!""

How did I do that to myself, over and over? Literally make myself sick? Lose nights and mornings and days? How did I even function?!

This is the longest I have been sober for since I started drinking every day. Thanks to the people who congratulated me today as I would not have known if you didnt reply to my check-in from this morning, you know who you are. Anyway - here are my thoughts I have from reflecting as of today, I will keep things short:

Checking in every day really does help. A lot. I have quit and relapsed countless times and today being my longest stretch is very much thanks to the daily commitment I make here in this sub every morning as part of my daily routine. I can't convince myself into taking that first experimental drink when I remind myself every single day how that badly that went for me before, and that I absolutely do not want to drink today. Part of what happened which resulted in me relapsing was forgetting how a couple drinks here and there always eventually becomes a daily habit, and then escalates rapidly from that point.

Simply reading other people's posts and comments in this sub can be helpful for much the same reason as checking in every day. Our experiences and relationships to alcohol are so similiar, and so often I read what you all have to say in this sub and I re-learn what experience has taught me, and it validates and solidifies my own experiences and the lessons I need to hold on to. I am not an active poster except for my simple daily check-ins, but I read a thread here and there every day and also have a little read in the check-in thread when upvoting others and I am sure I benefit from doing so immensely. 

Having reasons, or one big reason not to drink is huge. If you can't think of one big motivating factor, like I couldn't - give yourself one. For me it was running and then weight loss. Running helped my mental health and I have also started logging my meals and working towards losing at least some of my beer gut, slowly but surely. When I have thought about drinking, sometimes the progress I have made in the fitness and not wanting to squander that make it that much easier to put those thoughts aside and refocus. Another one for me is living in a clean and tidy home for the first time in actually longer time than I have been a drunk... I know keeping my living conditions in good shape is a lot easier if you do a little here and there, than after neglecting everything for month long benders.

Sober, I like who I am And I have a good life. When I drink, even just after one glass, I I don‚Äôt even recognise the person I become. My first big issue with alcohol was getting black out drunk and cheating on a boyfriend who I loved. I‚Äôve done stints of sobriety but always end up back in the same chaotic alcohol fueled place. 
After a particularly crazy weekend in may I brought myself to a&e thinking I was having a heart attack. After that, I managed 6 weeks sober and I was feeling better than ever. Then, I had a sudden death in my family and I had one drink after the funeral. It has then spiralled out of control again since then.
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm back at square one and I‚Äôm absolutely riddled with guilt , shame and embarrassment for my actions and lack of self control.

Life is so much easier now. Not having that addiction is like having one less person in the family to care for: 

A shitty person. 

A careless person that spends all your money. 

A selfish person that wants you to spend all your time with them and only them.

A mean hearted person that pits you against your loved ones.

A bad influence that convinces you to do things that aren't in your best interest.

There's still days I miss it, there are still days when I feel like I'm missing out, but every time it gets easier to remind myself that I miss the idea and the memory, not the reality. Stay strong, be kind to yourself, give yourself time. If you cant commit to forever, just commit to today.

Good Monday to you all! I apologize for missing the Monday AoK for a couple weeks. I'm back on schedule now :)

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

This week's Act of Kindness comes firsthand from a recent personal experience. I have been dating a mother of four children and neither of us have a vehicle that can seat all six of us together. We've been jockeying our outings either using two vehicles or with split rides from her family friends. Her truck has begun to have some issues and she needed access to a vehicle that could tow a trailer and haul feed for her animals. A friend of hers came through for us and let her borrow a heavy duty pickup truck with six seats. He's an older retired fellow that's just as kind and patient as can be. A 'been there done that' type of guy. We collected the animal feed and returned to her property where we, of course, got a flat tire. I put on the spare and we returned the pickup truck to it's owner after unloading hay. I agreed to return the next day to pick up the original tire and have it replaced at my expense. The following day, I picked up the tire and took it to a local tire shop where I explained the situation. The manager overheard me telling the story of the flat and recognized my girlfriend from the story I told (small town, amirite), so he opted to repair the tire for free. These seemingly small acts of kindness really cheered me up and gave me hope. I hope you find some kindness out there today too!

On Saturday we went to a festival near our hometown. For the first time in months we did what we missed the most: going to listen to music and dance the whole night.Again: I drank waaaaay to much beer and most of the night is a complete blur.

On Sunday I was home alone with my daughters of 8 and 5.Before it was even noon I already drank 2 gin tonics and half a bottle of wine.

I didn‚Äôt stop until the evening and lost count of all the alcohol I drank.Off course, my wife clearly saw how drunk I was and threatened to leave me if I kept on drinking like that. I was so far away, that I didn‚Äôt even care what she said or did even though I would be devastated if she left me !

This morning I was so ashamed and angry on myself because I ruined my whole weekend for myself AND my wife and kids.

At work I read 100‚Äôs of posts in this subreddit and it really helped me understand that I must take action now. I don‚Äôt want to forget conversations and ruin happy moments any longer.

I‚Äôm about halfway through it and I‚Äôve learned a whole lot about why it is so difficult to quit. I can see why so many people on here recommend it. 

Anyway, I haven‚Äôt told anyone in real life that I am trying to quit. I‚Äôve tried to quit a few times in the past and did tell my friends and family then, but I failed each time. I feel like the boy who cried wolf. I just feel them saying ‚Äúyeah, yeah, here he goes again freaking out about alcohol. He‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äù

September 1st is right around the corner. I‚Äôve had great success doing ‚Äúsober months‚Äú in the past (dry January, sober October, etc.), and it is much easier to get my friends and family on board with that. It‚Äôs easier to explain that I‚Äôm just taking a break to recalibrate my drinking habits and focus on my health and fitness. Often, some will join me and we help each other be accountable. It‚Äôs funny how everyone seems to agree that taking a break is good for health and fitness but think it is crazy to abstain forever for the same reasons. 

What I won‚Äôt tell them is that at the end of the month, I plan on keeping my sober streak going. Even though this is my plan, I think my subconscious is tricked into thinking it is only temporary  (just for September) which helps me succeed. I am hopeful that This Naked Mind will help my unconscious mind get on the same page as my conscious mind by the end of September and that the physical cravings will calm down by then which will make things easier.

Good morning and sorry for the wall of text.  I am not sure why I waited so long to post here but I guess today was the day.  When I was on the fence this is one of the places I came for some.... answers?  Advice?  Proof that I was an alcoholic?  I am not really sure.  All I know is I was looking down the barrel.  I knew the way I was living was not sustainable.  I was unhappy, depressed and scared.  I didn't know what to do.  I knew for a very long time that the way I drank wasn't healthy or normal.  The truth is the alternative didn't sound any better.  I was scared all the time.  I had anxiety, self hatred and self pity out the wazoo.  The only thing I had was alcohol.  I couldn't fathom having that taken away.  Then a miracle happened.  I hit my bottom.  Got in trouble at work one too many times then went to rehab to save that and when I got home was immediately arrested for DWI.  My wife kicked me out, I was positive I lost my job, I had no license and I hated my self.  From that came the realization that if I wanted to live I had to try something new.  Most of all I had to admit that I didn't have answers and that I needed to listen to others.  My journey involved a lot of different groups and people but the thing that made it possible for me was the idea of one day at a time.  Just don't drink today.  No matter what just make it through today.  With that also comes the fact that you only have today.  You cant change yesterday.  My past actions don't go away and I need to face the consequences for my actions BUT I cant change it.  It happened.  I need to live for 24 hours at a time and do my best.  I also can't predict the future.  I found that if I just do my best for 24 hours, don't drink and do the right thing my past actions don't sting as much.  They don't have the power they once did.  The future is bright.  I believe that is from doing the best I can for one day at a time.   I had a long journey and I just had my license reinstated.  My wife took me back and we are stronger than ever.  I was able to keep my job and I am thriving.  My friends and family look at me in a different light.  My father has said multiple times that I am like a different person (I believe that's because I am).   My wife and I are even trying for a child now.  that is something that I couldn't fathom just two years ago.  All of these blessing don't come close to one gift I have been given in sobriety:  I am happy.  I never thought I could live a life with out alcohol.  A bottle of vodka at the end of the day was all I had to look forward to for a very long time.  I don't need that anymore.  I am grateful for my life now.

First day of college someone put a 40 in my hand and that was it. Partied it up for a couple years, nothing major. Things took a turn for the worse and I had to drop out after my sophomore year. I had to give up on the dreams I had since I was a kid. It was crushing. I never actually dealt with the loss and grief I was facing over it. I just turned to drinking. The last 2 years has been a steady downward spiral. My drinking really ramped up during the pandemic. Nothing else to do, ya know? Well of course that had negative consequences on my life. My grades dropped, stress began piling up, and I just kept drinking more to cope. You all know that cycle, I‚Äôm sure. 

Despite all this I managed to keep it pretty well hidden. Met an amazing woman at the beginning of this summer and we fell in love fast. I got a dui over the 4th and she was there to support me through the worst. I didn‚Äôt learn my lesson though. 

I got evicted last week for non-alcohol related reasons and I just fucking snapped. The floodgates opened on all the last 2 years of pain and failure. I had a complete breakdown, and guess what I did? Chugged a 12 pack of Coors and tried to hang myself. I completely flipped out on the love of my life over text and she made the decision to end things temporarily. I was heartbroken. I‚Äôve let alcohol take so much from me and now I let it take the relationship I treasured most. 

There‚Äôs a lot of work ahead. I drafted a very long and sincere apology to her. I recognize she needs more time. I fucked a lot up and she deserves an apology from the bottom of my heart. 

I‚Äôve decided this has to be it. Im still drinking in small amounts to fend off the withdrawals, but I intend to do a proper detox as soon as im finished packing up my old place. Alcohol has brought me nothing but an endless cycle of pain and I want out. Cheers",23,1

I usually eat foods that are both healthy and enjoyable for me, but I still end up craving junk food.

But every time I give into the cravings, it's never satisfying. Ever. It tastes good, but not anywhere near what I imagine in my head. 

If I have just one donut, it will be gone in about 4 bites and I'll feel disappointed. If I have 2 donuts, the second one won't taste as good. And so on. Somehow the craving continues even as the taste deminishes, so you end up chasing something you're not going to get. This is how I end up binging.

But even if I moderate it and just have the one donut, I still get more disappointment then I do enjoyment. I even get anxiety while eating it, knowing that it will soon be gone.

So it's like the only option is to never have junk food, ever. But that would take an enormous amount of willpower while dealing with cravings for it. Is there a trick to permanently stop ""romanticizing"" food?",14,0

You should feel comfortable having your cake and eating it too.

I‚Äôm two months sober from alcohol, and 2.5 years from nicotine. Five years from marijuana. I also work as a professional craft bartender and I spend 40+ hours a week talking, making, and serving alcohol. It‚Äôs my life and my passion. And after I get off work at 12-1 am, I go to a bar. I do all of this without a drop of alcohol (besides what I straw taste when I make something new).

A lot of bars nowadays offer non-alcoholic options. Cold brew coffee, energy drinks, tea, komboucha. It gives me something to enjoy and a way to support the bar I‚Äôm in.

What have I learned from socializing at bars sober? I can talk with people WAY better than I did when I drank. It‚Äôs easier to keep up, and I feel way more comfortable with myself. I can sit in one spot and pay attention. It‚Äôs easier to make strangers I strike up with feel heard because I‚Äôm actually listening. I can also gift them with my authentic self and not just cowardice rebranded.

And what does that do for me? It makes me feel more inclined to be sober. I can spend 2-3 hours out at a bar, have good bits of conversation with random people, and I‚Äôll maybe spend $15 the whole evening. I can drive home without fear of a DUI, and I wake up feeling refreshed.

And I‚Äôm only posting this because I have some people I know in person that are wishing to go sober and they bring up going out to the bars as an example of why they are having a hard time quitting. I think it‚Äôs good to redefine your relationship with the bar scene and picture it more as a coffee shop than a tap house.",34,0

 I drink heavily when i do drink. I nearly always black out (or simply want to black out). In recent years I've gotten into a habit of going home from a night out and staying up all night drinking by myself till I pass out. Or i simply started off by myself and drink till i pass out. 

Ive never been a morning drinker, its oddly enough a hard boundary for me. I usually stop when i wake up w/ deadly hangovers. I don't usually drink on weekdays, thursdays are a maybe, but weekends are when i eagerly get fucked up.  Ive got a BA, i've lived in multiple countries, and my resume looks decent. I have only been fired from one job due to drinking. I have had a bestfriend cut me off for drinking related behavior. I have tried to quit drinking multiple times, but have never made it past 2 months.

Good Morning! Great to speak to all of you yesterday - I hadn't appreciated just how many people are in this group, it really is incredible. So many great little acts of rebellion from you all!

So today I want to talk a bit about how we view addiction. There's a Mitch Hedberg quote that I think about a lot:

> *Alcoholism is a disease, but it‚Äôs the only one you can get yelled at for having.* 

Our society - and ourselves because we are after all shaped by the attitudes of those around us - can be very judgemental of addiction. We have a real tendency to blame addicts for their addiction and think of ourselves as somehow weak or broken for having issues with it - we look at others who don't have addiction issues and wonder why we can't drink like them. Like 'normal people'. And we blame ourselves for that. 

Whereas the truth of matter is often that addiction, that having a disordered response to alcohol is usually symptomatic of other issues - what psychologists call a 'maladaptive coping mode'.

I've had so many Day Ones I genuinely couldn't count them, I blamed drinking for my problems and my inability to stop it on myself. I beat myself up for being weak-willed. I yelled at myself for having a disease. Why couldn't I just stop? I knew that I should, I wanted to, why couldn't I do it? It must have been some terrible failure of character on my part.

When I finally got therapy to deal with the things that I was using alcohol to avoid, my therapist introduced me to the idea of Schema Modes - that in a lot of our inner responses we are repeating learned patterns and we treat our vulnerable or impulsive or angry inner child in the way a punitive or demanding parent would. In dealing with the things that were pushing me towards addiction, I was able to make a much better attempt at dealing with the addiction itself. Treating it as a symptom, not a cause.

But if we look at that impulse,  that want to run away and hide in alcohol as a scared child then maybe we can be a bit more compassionate towards ourselves. When I was struggling my therapist would often ask me - ""how would you treat a child who felt this way? How would you treat a friend?""

Let's treat ourselves the way we would treat our friend.

One month ago, due to unemployment and because I do tend to binge on alcohol, I felt quite strong to quit. One day at a time, trying to make a one month mark and so on.

And then, 1 month ago, my mother died as a consequence of covid (she was vaccinated, cautious, and yet..).

I'm living my worst nightmare, literally, this has been my biggest fear since I was a child. And I realized I'm quite strong, actually, living my pain, allowing myself to cry and isolate from /connect with people when I want, and I'm the n1 priority now.

The paradox is: like may of us here, there was always an excuse to drink. Unemployed, I drink cause I'm anxious; when I'm employed, because I'm exhausted. Sad? Drink to numb the feelings away temporarily. Happy? Drink to celebrate. etc etc etc.

So, this would be the ""most excusable"" moment to get drunk regularly. My mum died! At the same time, I keep thinking: well if I'm being strong in general during this awful time (I drink 3 times a week, but I binge), why not surf on this strenght to quit?

If possible, I'd like to read some advices, from people that went through this type of loss while sober or not, or any word of encouragement from anyone.

Thanks so much",7,1

We have a really significant age gap, so I was there to change her diapers as a baby and help with everything that she and my parents needed. We‚Äôre very close with one another, I would do absolutely anything for her. The day she was born was the first time I cried ‚Äúhappy tears.‚Äù So to see her in a hospital bed hooked up to a heart monitor, rail thin and in so much pain crushed me to the core of my being. 

I had to fly from one coast to another to see her on a day‚Äôs notice. Airports were a place where I would always get a drink (or a few, or a lot), pretty much no matter what time it was. I didn‚Äôt do that this time. 

A few years ago I moved across the country to pursue some things I‚Äôm passionate about and explore a new part of the country. She never understood why I wanted to leave, and I‚Äôve always had some guilt about it. That guilt these past few days has been crippling. 

Today I sat in a bar that my cousin works at with my grandparents, they said I should try some of the local brews (they didn‚Äôt know I stopped drinking). I opted for a club soda with a dash of bitters and a lemon wedge. 

I kind of surprised myself by saying no in that moment, but when the guy next to me put down four Makers in less than 15 minutes and proceeded to make an ass of himself to all the women in the bar, I remembered why I‚Äôm doing this: to be more present with those who need me, especially in a time like this; and especially so, to be more present with myself and true to who I am. 

I‚Äôve cried more in the past few days then I probably ever have, but being clearheaded and sober in this moment is something I am deeply thankful for. 

Thank you to all of you who have reassured me, have encouraged me, and shared your stories. I‚Äôm so grateful. IWNDWYT.",34,0

159,2021-08-29 23:14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pe9v3b/first_sober_vacation_complete/,First sober vacation complete!,"My mom and I are very close.  Every year since we lost my father, we go on a yearly trip to the beach to relax and laugh about everything. We stay in the same hotel, have a routine for each day etc. We keep to ourselves and spend 90% of our time on the beach, or by the pool far away from others so we can make up stories about them and just trying to make each other laugh.
 It's my favorite thing about our relationship.  
We love this trip and how we've built up memories at the same place for nearly 10 years now. 
I was drinking heavily in 2019 during our last trip. (No trip during 2020)  and it was probably the last time I could somewhat hide my binge drinking tendencies since vacations usually mean binge drinking. 
We just got back from our trip today and I am proud to say I am still 8 months without alcohol.  
I was so worried I'd be tempted by the illusion of vacation and being far away from 99% of my accountability as a spouse, friend and employee.  
I can't explain how relieved I was when I realized that I didn't crave alcohol or create a fantasy world where alcohol in moderation could work for me.
 I spoke openly with my mom and we agreed that this year was the best trip we've ever had. I had more energy, I was more fun, I actually RELAXED.
 My husband is super proud of me but told me he never doubted me. Hearing those words overwhelmed me to the point where I started crying while attempting to wash off the remaining sand in the shower. For the first time, they were literally tears of joy. Pure joy. I didn't let myself down. I didn't disappoint the two most valuable people in my world. 
You can do this. I can't explain why it's been so ""easy"" for my brain to not crave alcohol.  I can tell you I worked my ass off to train my brain to only remember the bad feelings of alcohol.  I remember the hangovers, the anxiety from waiting on my boss to ""believe"" the dramatic reason I gave him for not coming to work. I remember the depression and sickness from laying in bed trying to recover and feel like a stranger in my own home. I remember the moment my husband stopped falling for my bullshit and started to pull away from me...and I remember letting him start to slip away because I thought I had found real friends at the bars. 
Everything isn't peachy for me. I have lingering anxiety about the things I've done. It's like the longer I'm sober the more I remember.  Driving to work and having a sudden memory of a night out makes me nearly physically ill. I've had to pull over and convince myself it wasn't a recent memory. It's hard to explain, but I have told my doc. 
I have nightmares that I've gotten drunk. 
Sometimes I wish I could stop remembering random nights that I regret. I used to justify my behavior because I never once cheated. Never crossed my mind and never put myself in situations where it was implied I would cheat. That literally was good enough for my brain to justify the dumb and dangerous shit I did. 
Sorry for the ramble. I'm just all sorts of emotional tonight and have too many thoughts in my mind to make sense. 

I can tell you that I still gained weight on vacation.  But it wasn't from booze. It was gallons of melted butter from the thousands of pounds of crab legs I ate. 
I love you all.
 People that have given in to temptation on vacation and are still here? You're braver than me. You're still here. 
I want to hug each and every single one of you. IWNDWYT",18,0

So here's what I do to chill out and relax. Lights off in the bathroom with a single candle. Shower on, sitting in the shower in the dark, letting the water hit me and steam up and relax every part of the body. Sometimes I drink bubble waters in there as refreshment. Sometimes I play music, or ambient rain or forest sounds, or a podcast, or just silence. I have a waterproof case on my phone so a lot of times I just read in there too. it's like having your own spa and chunk of warm, dim, heaven where time means nothing. Hell it might use more water than I want to admit, but it's cheaper than a spa or therapy so there's that.

Even though alcohol has caused me to humiliate myself at major event like my wedding and  to be the fool of family gatherings, I have still turned to it for years.

While those occasions were more sporadic initially, they became more common over time. It soon became that I needed alcohol to enjoy any task that I dreaded‚Äîcleaning my house, organizing my closet, completing mundane paperwork tasks. That dependency was something to help me in the moment. The next day I would wake and feel guilty that I was such a loser that I needed something extra to help me do what normal people do. 

While all of that was problematic, the real drinking issues started during the pandemic. With so much time at home‚Äî-and more mundane tasks to complete than ever and more overall boredom‚ÄîI found that my drinking increased substantially. Not only was I drinking more frequently, but I was not really stopping for days at a time. When I would wake up the next morning feeling guilty for the day before, I would convince myself to just let the party continue, for as long as I continued drinking, I could ignore the shame I was experiencing. Several day benders are now the norm. My work life is really taking a major hit. 


Clearly, alcohol is destroying my life. I am so tired of living in a state of depression because of the person I have become‚Äîall due to the substance I abuse so regularly. 

I am tired of the crippling guilt and shame I live with. I am tired of being a drunk parent, who is more worried about my next drink  than playing with my kids. I am tired of gaining weight all because of the binge drinking. I am tired of hiding my bottles after sneaking to drink because of the humiliation I feel that causes me to drink in silence so to pretend normal and not like the true alcoholic that I am.  I am tired of feeling ‚Äúslow and foggy‚Äù opposed to sharpness I once felt. 


I have a dream job, family, and home.  I have so much to live for and so much to be happy about it.  It is time I experience it‚Äîand without shame and disgust interjecting.

On a heavy day of drinking I‚Äôd get a couple American honey shooters in the morning, work, get 2 at lunch, eat, maybe go back for 2 more, work, stop and get 3-5 on the way home, sit in the car and listen to a podcast while drinking and chasing each shot with a cigarette. Pull the car out of the parking lot, get 3-5 more. Shot. Cigarette. Shot. Cigarette. 
Half in, half out, never present.

I never said it out loud or told anyone, but I thought of them as my little ‚Äúpotions‚Äù and each one gave me the power to travel through time and slowly lose my grasp on sanity.

I‚Äôve wrecked my life hard a couple of times with drinking when I was in my early to mid twenties but I haven‚Äôt been mean or violent in years. I got a handle on it to where I would rarely *black* out‚Ä¶. But I would brown out- remembering the general events but not details. 
I got good at little tricks like glossing things over in conversation to where I didn‚Äôt have to remember details anyway. Other neat little tricks included long periods of total isolation so I wouldn‚Äôt have to hide my obvious drunkenness or deal with the next day‚Äôs anxious ‚Äúoh shit what did I say/do!‚Äù Even with a ‚Äúhandle‚Äù on it, even if I was spectacularly charming in social situations and even if I was reassured that I behaved in a great way and everyone loved my clever quips and stories and ideas, I would still feel extremely embarrassed and want to curl up and disappear.

I was sweet and loving to my girlfriend but not really *there there*. I would be very affectionate at times, grandiose, and fun. But I wouldn‚Äôt remember a lot. And my lack of a short term memory made all our conversations an exercise in mental acrobatics (as well as gymnastics, I‚Äôm sure).

I held my job down but I work on roofs and I was just perpetually fighting a war against the sun, dehydration and drunkenness. I was late, slow and tired always.

I seemed alright on the surface, but I was isolated, mentally damaging a brain that used to be half decent, no longer doing anything I once found joy in. Drinking was the occasion, the hobby, the relationship, the love, the ritual. Everything else was peripheral or complimentary or nothing at all. Whiskey was the punctuation mark to every street I went down, every conversation I had, every song that I sang, every decision I made.

Anytime I was sober, I was hungover. 
I would try and conceive of not drinking and long for it so and fluctuate between desperately thrashing in my mind for a way to escape to nihilistically celebrating my alcoholism to dog tired resignation and back and forth and all over.

Two months ago I woke up with my last hangover and just decided that I was sick of being drunk. There was no impetus of a big fuck up, my life wasn‚Äôt falling apart or anything like that. No big production, really.
I was just sick of only being able to retain vague impressions of the books I read, the looks and love I‚Äôve shared with my s/o, the memories of the last decade. 
Tired of never changing or growing, preserved by alcohol forever as some wretched shell who can only dream of alternate reality versions of himself and hope they have the happiness that I don‚Äôt.

I want this version of myself to be the one that diverged from that other, that other me who is sitting in this same room, mixing the last dregs from five little whiskey shots so he can smoke his last cigarette, maybe wondering how he‚Äôs going to scrounge up the cash to do it again tomorrow. And before he falls into the half sleep of the drunk, he‚Äôll think about how if he‚Äôd quit drinking two months ago he could be me.

Alcohol was a long hallway full of twists and turns. I saw and did and felt beautiful and horrific and divine and evil things walking down my hall.
But at the end of the hall is a doorway to everything I‚Äôve wanted in life. And I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm walking through it all because I‚Äôve learned that the most important step we can take isn‚Äôt the first or the last- it‚Äôs the next.

For the last two months my suicidal ideation has trickled to a stream. I‚Äôm much more engaged in my relationship with a partner who is the most adoring, beautiful soul I‚Äôve ever met and who has shown me endless patience and support even after she‚Äôs had to stand by and watch me self destruct. 

After 5 years without a license, I finally have it back and I‚Äôm driving legally for the first time in my life. For the first couple of weeks my heart would still race when I saw a cop, but last night my girlfriend and I drove to a bar to see my friend play music and I realized that the subconscious and ever present fear I had while driving my entire life was unnecessary now. I was driving at night and it was ALLOWED and wasn‚Äôt some huge endeavor that could very easily fuck up my whole world.

I was already physically tough, but for the first time in my life I *feel* strong. I quit smoking when I quit drinking and every morning I can just breathe, right off the bat. It‚Äôs incredible.

I won‚Äôt delude myself into thinking it‚Äôs impossible for me to ever drink again, but I know that right now, the idea of drinking makes me sick. Right now, I feel like I‚Äôve escaped the prison of that alternate reality and I don‚Äôt ever want to be anyone but this person and the potential person I could be without that millstone around my neck, dragging me away from all that I‚Äôm capable. Because without booze to obfuscate, I‚Äôm kinda fucking awesome at a lot of things that I had to learn or find ways to compensate for when I was handicapped by alcohol. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt that way or any way aside from self loathing and desperation.

I grew up on and off homeless with addict parents, left home at 15 and became an addict at 20 after couch surfing and being in bands for years. This is the first time my life has ever been ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and it‚Äôs a precious, shiny thing to me that I‚Äôll never understand my friends rebelling against and that I never want to lose.

Hope any of this helps someone. This subreddit helped me a lot.

Ps. The lion‚Äôs share of this is from a comment I made on someone else‚Äôs post but I‚Äôve never posted here (or anywhere else on reddit) and maybe sharing might help someone else. I‚Äôve edited my original comment to expand on some stuff and to make it make sense as it‚Äôs own post.

We were there for a good while, my friends like big parties. Had dinner, chatted. Some of these people embarassed themselves; some, a lot; some were impossible to talk to or half passed, some did not and were fine.  In general it was a good time

Me, I am so damn glad I was there for 8 hours straight without drinking a drop, and having as much fun as I could given the circumnstances (I am sure I'd have had much more fun, or at least better conversation, if the others didn't drink, but you work with what you have) . Being clear headed and happy, no anxiety at all, just talking to my friends. More than happy in fact. I am not stupid hangover, I don't have blackouts, I didn't do anything bad or embarassing (and I witnessed a few such acts).

I will not drink with you today!",26,0

i love to go to the zombie crawl, and it was canceled last year.  i'd think it would be a go for this year, especially since it's outside (and i can go to movies with no mask because i'm fully vaccinated) but no.  however, there will be a pub crawl in lodo that lasts from 6PM to 2AM.  if i get tickets early, it's $15, after 10/1, it's $35.  there are 10 bars and the pass allows discounted drinks, which will be a plus if it covers virgin drinks as well as liquor.

i hope the free one comes back because it's 11AM to 4PM, with the organ trail, costume contest and pub crawls after dark.  i can go and come home before dark when everyone's drunk.  but this is all there is, so i'm going at least once.  if i hate it, i can always leave.",5,1

196,2021-08-29 17:34:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pe49x4/telling_on_myself/,Telling on myself.,"Hi everyone!

I'm posting for accountability more than anything else, and also, this ain't my first rodeo. If I don't talk about it I'm going to relapse.

I'm thinking about going to a dispensary and buying some weed. I realize that this is ""Stop Drinking,"" not ""Stop Everything,"" but I've fallen into this particular trap before. My last relapse was mainly smoking weed like it was my job, which was ""fine"" because I'm an alcoholic and weed isn't a problem for me, and anyway, we *all* know that it's not addictive so if it ended up being a problem I could quit anytime. It did not play out like that for me, yet here I am, four and a half years after I fell into that trap, thinking about doing it again. 

I've been dealing with a stalker longer than I've been sober. It's basically taken away my ability to live a normal life and destroyed my mental health, I'm dealing with a lot of PTSD, and I'm pretty isolated. I'm in a state where recreational marijuana use is now legal, and last night, for whatever reason, the mental obsession about getting stoned kicked in, and my brain is throwing all sort of stuff at me about why it would be ""fine"" and perfectly justified, and it's not like my life isn't in the toilet anyway, sobriety has actually ended up being really sucky for me, etc. etc.

The only thing that has stopped me from going to a dispensary today is my sobriety date. I've talked on here before about how my sobriety date is a firm boundary that I have with myself about what my sobriety is, and if I cross that boundary, I lose my sobriety date. I don't adjust my definition of what my sobriety is in order to accommodate my behavior. Which is saving my ass at this particular moment in time. Because if I didn't have a sobriety date and a clear definition of what sobriety means to me, I'd be getting stoned right now ""just to see if it helps,"" because ""I can quit again if it ends up being a problem for me"" and ""I can get sober again later."" And ""it's not like I'd be drinking.""

If I cross that line, I lose my sobriety date, and that forces me to pause and reflect on what my sobriety means for me. My life sucks right now, but that's not sobriety's fault. And yeah, I probably would feel better if I was chemically altering my feelings and my perception of reality, but that wouldn't change reality. I would still be stuck in the exact situation that I'm in, and when you're using marijuana, alcohol, or any other drug to avoid reality, it means that you're basically signing up to use it constantly, which means that reality is only going to get worse. There are no bad situations that are improved by drinking or using drugs. Zero. None.

But anyway, I'm just posting for accountability. The bitch of it is that I don't even really *like* weed, but I know that I can't drink, and so my addiction is finding another way to get a foot in the door. I *know* this. I've already *been* through this. But hot damn if my mind doesn't want a way out of how I feel right now.

Anyway. I'm still sober. Sobriety isn't always pretty, but it's always worth it, and every day is a success as long as I hit the pillow at night sober. Much love to you all. üíú IWNDOSWWYT (I will not drink or smoke weed with you today)",18,0

This weekend we had showings all weekend so I had to find someplace to stay, and I finally came home today and I've been overtired all weekend and I guess I was rambling out of control and my mom accused me of drinking again because I have ""motor mouth"" when I'm drunk.
I'm so disheartened now because I've worked so hard this past week after sobriety problems for a while, and after a hard week of being sober, being accused of being drunk just makes me want to start drinking again.

\-Dealt with the death of two grandparents  
\-Got Covid  
\-Lived through another strange year of the pandemic  
\-Moved out of a stressful living situation and into my own apartment  
\-Decided my job wasn‚Äôt making me happy and found a new job which is a big step up (first day tomorrow!)  
\-celebrated my first sober birthday, new year, and vacation of my adult life, attended my first sober wedding, the list of firsts goes on and on‚Ä¶  


Sometimes things felt really hard, but I felt all of it. Drinking was my main coping mechanism for uncomfortable feelings, and there were times this past year when I felt emotionally overwhelmed and didn‚Äôt handle things in a mature way. I will admit there was a lot of complaining, snapping at loved ones, and the occasional bout of crying on the floor. But I didn‚Äôt drink, and so I don‚Äôt have any major regrets or a vague sense of dread hanging over me like I did before. I moved through the pain and discomfort and life lessons rather than trying to dodge them by getting drunk.  


And things weren‚Äôt always hard! They were wonderful too. I found joy in everyday things that I previously just viewed as chores to slog through before I could get drunk again. I spent a ton of time with my family, doing cartwheels and somersaults to make my two-year-old nephew laugh. I became an aunt a second time over and saw my sister become a mom. I danced like a crazy person at my close friend‚Äôs wedding, fueled by plain old diet coke and wedding cake, and was able to drive people home safely at the end of the night. I actually felt endorphins from exercise (really thought those were a myth). And right now I‚Äôm lying in bed, feeling the weight of my cat purring on my lap and feeling very grateful and NOT hungover. I spent so much of my 20s waiting for the next drink, waiting for something to happen or ‚Äúreal life‚Äù to begin, but this IS my life and I plan on being present and sober for it.  


I could not have done it without this subreddit. It was an enormous help to read people‚Äôs stories whenever I felt weak or needed motivation or advice on navigating a ‚Äúsober first.‚Äù I am also very lucky to have several sober family members who paved the way for me and were a source of inspiration and strength. Other things that helped me were journaling, exercising, reading quit lit, and doing The Sober School course (not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea but it helped keep me focused in the first couple months of sobriety and examine the role alcohol was playing in my life). And a huge shout out to the real mvp: sugar. Chocolate, ice cream, cookies, sour gummy worms‚Ä¶love you so much, couldn‚Äôt have done it without you.

I didn't honestly believe that would happen to me. I have a lot of negative emotions about cleaning that stem from some traumatic situations in my adolescence.

Then...this week and this weekend happened. Every day this week, I woke up before my alarm. My alarm goes off at 5:05 am, so waking up rested before that time is pretty early. This never happened before I quit drinking. Every night before going to bed this past week, I had the energy to wash the dishes and make sure my stuff was put together for the next morning. Yesterday, I worked an extra shift and had to be there around 6:30 am. I woke up at 5 am, bright eyed and wide awake. I got up, made the coffee, contemplated going for a run and decided to take care of some little chores around the house, instead. After my shift, in the past, I would have stopped at the liquor store, stocked up on alcohol and spent the rest of the afternoon on my back deck drinking because I had ""earned it"". Not yesterday. I did my grocery shopping then came home and cleaned my house and did all my laundry. I went to bed early and snuggled into my pillows happy that I had a clean home and my clothes were clean for the upcoming week.

I am SO GRATEFUL to have made it this far into my sobriety. I am starting to see how the daily habit of drinking had such a big impact on my everyday life.

Told my ma I was coming home and then went radio silent on her and so she was worried about me, now she's mad at me.... I am covered in cuts and bruises. 

I was meant to be going out tonight too since it was a bank holiday but rather then sit back and say I'll cut back I am at a point where I just have to quit full stop. Im not going tonight. It'll be hard since its the only thing I get invited out for and that'll mean no friends and more isolation which I already isolate myself when sober down to the depression I experience. I know that drinking doesn't help the depression in general but I really love the social side of it. 

I need to figure out what to do, I have a birthday party coming up next weekend and the next 2 weekends after that I'm meant to be going to festivals ... then the following week after that I'm meant to be in scotland.

Sincerely, A Perfectionist","So like a lot of people, I drank to get a ""break"" from my own head. There are many reasons we need a brain break but mine are because I have a tendency to go over negative thoughts over and over. Not OCD but sort of similar.

At heart I'm a recovering perfectionist. I have a tendency to repeat in my head things I wished I had done differently/perfectly. This isn't things I wished I hadn't done drunk. I was actually a very well behaved drunk. But it is tied to why I drank.

For example I quit a job about 7 years ago badly. As in, I left with the minimum notice during a major project and didn't stay in contact with a single person to keep my network alive. It was an incredibly toxic place and took a lot out of me. I was a hot mess by the time I gave up and raised my white flag (a perfectionist hanging in until the bitter end, gah). Today my brain won't stop going around and around how I could have quit ""better."" I know on lots of levels what I did was totally acceptable. Most people if they heard the details would agree I should have left. But there is that tiny bit of me that wants perfection. Like I'm some kind of miracle worker lol.

I know what triggered it. I woke up screaming from a nightmare this morning. Actually my husband had to shake me out of it. It's hours later and I still can't shake the feeling of it. I can't quite decide if it's an old terrible childhood memory resurfacing (has been happening since my father died a few months back) or my body trying to get me breathing again (I have sleep apnea and my brain gives me horrible nightmares to wake me up and get me breathing). 

So feeling vulnerable this way has me wanting to drink today. It's a quiet day of vacation at the cottage and it would be nice to get the break from my brain. Holy fuck would I love a numb brain (but I won't).

Instead I'm doing the work. (I can hear my counselor saying it in my head as I imagine relaying this story to her later this week, ""This is you doing the work."")


My work...  



1. Recognizing that I want alcohol and by this evening it's gonna be worse. If I pretend otherwise ignore the signs, I'm setting myself up to fail. >Make a plan to help cope as it gets harder today. >Activities + support person.   



2. Figure out my trigger.  >Feeling vulnerable from the nightmare, which lead to letting my guard down about negative thoughts, not using my coping strategies which led to thoughts about alcohol   



3. Using my skills to combat perfectionism. >Allow myself to go over the ""mistakes"" twice, fully but then enough is enough and redirect my thoughts when they try to slip back. I also do not allow another ""mistake"" to take its place to go over and over which will happen if I let it  



4. Be in the moment and be vulnerable.  >Accept that feeling bad is ok and not something to avoid at all costs. 

I guess what I want to say in this long rambling post is that ""doing the work"" to stay sober is more than just avoiding alcohol.  I know a lot label the difference between the two as being sober and being in recovery. For me I just want to do the hard work to be more comfortable in my own head, no labels.

I don't know why I wrote this all out. Normally it would have been a journaling entry but maybe it will make someone else feel less alone. 

Day 50 something has been a tough one!

I am writing 2 days post another illustrious bender in my hometown, where I've been the past week visiting my parents. Gathered a few chaps together, went out, go utterly wasted, blacked out, didn't come home, had parents worried, may or may not have made a mistake and now in this horrible guilt cycle. Again.

I don't know why, but I can't just have ""one drink"". I don't sit around drinking lots during the week, far from that in fact, but when I do, I drink to the absolute excess. I can't handle it, I can't say no, and I black out far more than anyone else I know.

I absolutely hate myself for it and feel like a scum bag of a human. Away from drinking I am just a normal human, and don't behave that some awful creature created to run rampant on humanity. I've done this sort of charade at what must now be 100s of times over the past 10 years and I'm just so ashamed of it.

Last year I didn't drink for 162 days due to Lockdown and I felt great. Unfortunately I have a suicidal father, which I think in the end has really affected me deep down, so when I drink I become ""someone else"". 

I am just starting to see this wonderful lady who I care about deeply, and don't want to lose her, and yet I'm worried that more episodes like that night will result in me losing her. I also really want to travel the world, but I can't trust myself with the drinking element which makes me worried about going somewhere foreign.

During my college years(I am 23, two months from being 24.), I was a heavy drinker my junior and senior year. I drank every day almost, 10-12 drinks a day on the days I did drink and would regularly experience from blackouts. I missed work and class and it fucked my life up. I still graduated but the last few semesters were really rough. It was a dark place in my life but it still continued after I came back home. My lowest point was when my dad found me passed out drunk on the bed once he came home from work. I fought sobriety for a while and went and saw a counselor for a while but still continued to drink a few nights a week and is still something I deal with.  


However, today my dad was diagnosed with cirrhosis of his liver after just really recently displaying symptoms of it and he may require a liver transplant. This made me think about what is going to happen to me one day if I don't stop ASAP. I'm worried I may have liver disease as a result of going through a very depressive time in my life but I am not certain if I do. I am considering going and getting a blood test to see what my liver function is like. I don't want to die from cirrhosis of my liver or other liver disease. What is the damage from what I have done so far?  


I am 3 days sober as of today. I am trying to swear to myself that I am never going to drink again.  Thank you for listening and advice that it is given I will appreciate. Hopefully the damage I caused won't be too bad long-term, but my mind is running crazy with anxiety. I HAVE TO CHANGE. I'm so afraid of what might happen to me.",15,0

Every day that I'm sober extends the streak of the most consecutive days without alcohol. As of 10 hours ago, that makes a week. In the 7 or so years prior to this, I don't think I've gone that long between drinks. For a while, it was every single day, for one reason or another.

But today, I woke up on Day 8, no hangover, and feeling alright. Went for a quick walk (too damn hot) and am going to enjoy my day today.

It hasn't been easy. It never is for someone who drank like I did. I cried a lot the first few nights. So many emotions I had concealed within the bottles finally poured out, and in a way, it felt relieving. I'm still learning new triggers for me and trying to learn to cope with or avoid them. 

I live with two active alcoholics with only one showing a desire to slow down/stop drinking. The other one will want to sleep today away and neglect his one chore he's asked to do because he got loaded last night. Some of you will say that it's tempting fate by continuing to live with them. And you may be right, but I have no desire to drink, even when they piss me off. Instead, I'm learning to be patient with people. Slowly. I still fly off the handle sometimes, but it's not the alcohol doing it this time. It's just me, learning to be human again.

See, I used alcohol as fuel, per se. Like I considered myself just a machine in the system. Alcohol goes in, work and chores and socialization come out. Well, somewhere along the line, the machine malfunctioned, but worked well enough to not call a repairman. I finally called, and I'm glad I did. 

So today, I'm a week alcohol-free (I'd say sober, but I still smoke a little most evenings). But here's the thing: I don't care. It's one week, big deal. As many others have said before, and many more will say, it's not just getting sober. It's getting to a healthier life that you can like and enjoy. Problem is, right now, I don't like much of anything. I understand that it's my brain reforming the natural pathways and it'll take time to get back to receiving dopamine from normal stuff like a good movie or show, but I'll admit I'm impatient. Basically every day since I took my last drink, at some point or another, I just lose all dopamine. Go physically cold, feeling empty. I assume it's either my body telling me to eat/do something, or my brain asking for more of it's usual ""fuel"" and partially shutting down without it. It makes it hard to give a shit about anything. Not a ""fuck it, let's drink to feel better!"" but more of a ""so you exist and this is your life now. huh."" kinda deal. Makes it hard to care, even about the people you love.

TL;DR I'm a week sober after being a useless drunk for too long, and I just don't care",7,0

I was always very skinny before that but after all that beer I gained quite a bit of weight. I recently quit drinking for the most part in early february, Ill still have some drinks occasionally but nowhere even close to before february when I was drinking a lot of beer every day. Ive lost a bit of weight since then but not like I was before I started really drinking. Im wondering why? its been 7 months almost completely sober and I still have a bit of a beer belly and not the skinny but toned look I had before which I heavily prefer to the skinny-fat I am now. anyone else have this experience. the weight gain was one of my least favorite consequences of alcoholism I thought i would return to my previous weight because I only gained weight when I started to drink heavily.

Edit: OH HEY GUYS I FORGOT IM ON A SLEEPING MEDICATION THAT HAS WEIGHT GAIN AS A COMMON SIDE EFFECT! It's called Mirtazapine. definitely could have something to do with this

My heart is breaking because I hurt the one I love most over a stupid drink (or ten). 

While this isn't my only motivation for moving to a life without alcohol, this is a huge factor. I'm dealing with so much grief and loss today.

I honestly don't have a lot to say that hasn't already been shared here before. My life is dramatically better without being drunk almost every single night.

I ran my first ever (ever!) race today. Running became a really big deal to me when I quit drinkin and it is one of many positive things to develop in my life since making this- seemingly at first but hardly after- dramatic change in my life. The race went good- I averaged a 7:45/mi. for our city's annual 10k. I could never run fast than 11:30/mi. a year ago. I feel great about that. 

Anyway, that's all I have to say.

I'm just over two weeks sober. However, I've largely avoided drink for a month--I had one very noticeable slip-up, just a couple days before my birthday. 

I've noticed, in the last couple weeks, that I'm sleeping much more than usual. Last night, for instance, I went to bed around 3 o'clock in the morning. I woke up with my alarm, at 11am, but wound up pounding the snooze button and crawling out of bed just a few minutes before 4pm. 

I'd say I've lately been averaging anywhere between 10 and 13 hours of sleep per night. In the past, I regularly slept between 4.5 and 7 hours each day, and that was usually enough to get me through class, work, and more. 

Make no mistake: the quality of my sleep is much, **much** better than it has been at almost any other point in my life. I don't wake up with stomach pain, gnawing anxiety, or for seemingly frivolous reasons. If I get up, it's to use the bathroom, and then I'm right back in bed. 

However, I've found it *very* hard to get up at ""normal"" times, since my body always tries getting me back into bed. It doesn't help that I work remotely and set my own hours, so there's no very compelling reason for me to be on time.

My question is: what are some REALISTIC expectations you have from your significant other regarding drinking and their support? Should you have zero expectations? 

Some dude the other day messaged me asking for nonalcoholic beer recommendations because his wife quit drinking and he stopped in support of her. I thought that was pretty amazing of him ‚Äî- but I realize it‚Äôs unfair to expect that out of someone.

I‚Äôve been with my significant other for four years now. I really do adore him. We used to drink nightly and heavily. He‚Äôs cut back a bunch, mostly because he went back to school recently and has to wake up at 7 AM everyday. Last year he was hardly drinking at all when we quarantined together. I told him that I didn‚Äôt expect him to quit completely but we‚Äôd probably have to break up if he chose to still drink heavily around me because I didn‚Äôt want to be anywhere near it. I didn‚Äôt want to be tempted and I was in a very fragile mindset. He obliged. 

That‚Äôs changed somewhat in the months since. He buys beer regularly now (though he keeps it in a fridge out back) and drinks most nights (though it‚Äôs usually only a couple beers). Every now and then he still wants to get drunk. He was talking about wanting to ‚Äúget trashed with some friends‚Äù the other day and about inviting a few people over. 

I dunno, it just seems really fucking insensitive. 

Only one friend ended up coming over so I just called it an early night. 

I‚Äôm allergic to cats. If he wants to get trashed here, he might as well bring home a bunch of cats with him.

I invited him to my birthday night (AA) and while he said he‚Äôd go, he seemed very hesitant/weird about it. I‚Äôll probably just go alone.

Im wondering if I‚Äôm a bitch whose expectations are unrealistic or too high. I love this dude to death and want to spend my life with him‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm also just kinda put off by him completely right now.

I apologize in advance for this won't be my finest piece of writing, but I wanted to stream consciousness¬†my thoughts¬†on the last year, the years before, and where I am right now.¬†

I remember a year or so before I actually quit quietly scouring this page for a post or message that would truly click. Maybe someone had figured out how to drink moderately and casually, and had become normal, and I could find it here? Or maybe there was some pill someone¬†had been prescribed to that had scrubbed their whole brain of any memory of alcohol, and I could pick it up at CVS?¬†

I didn't find it. I found a lot of extremely strong people that had bravely quit drinking in a world soaked with alcohol that I couldn't relate to. See, alcohol was my personality. I was a proud¬†party girl on the outside through and through. I laughed about my drinking as if it were a clever personality quirk, and not an addiction¬†that had me choked in a vice grip, unable to even picture a sober life.¬†

I began drinking in high school. I was a dramatic teenager, and the introduction of alcohol suddenly enhanced the angst and drama that I was feeling. Drinking was fine, but I was much more focused on the boys and friends I drank with, and dissecting the evening's events the next day. Alcohol was sexy and cool, but it was something that I associated with dark basements and the guys I was attempting to attract. During the days and other evenings, I could take it or leave it. College was the same. It was about the people, not the drink.¬†

That changed in my mid-20s. This is a strange period that isn't talked about as much as it should be. I was suddenly separated from my friends by miles and miles. I left a long-term relationship, brushed myself off, and found myself, lonely for the first time in my life. I'm an extrovert to my core, my energy fueled from other people, those people that I was initially addicted¬†to in those dark basements.¬†

So my addiction transferred. I began drinking a few¬†glasses of wine every night. It was fine, we've all seen the woman on tv with the high-stress job pour her wine before even taking her heels off. I was just like her! Wine began to switch to vodka, because calories of course. This is when alarm bells began to go off in my head. Something is not right with this Sleepgone, drinking vodka sodas alone most evenings is NOT what I'd seen on TV.¬†

In fact, no one around me was drinking like I was. My friends had began to be coupled up, they'd sip a drink or two at happy hour, and I'd walk away the drunkest, by myself of course. I was dating, but after a few weeks my blackout banshee would shine through, and I'd get unceremoniously¬†dumped the next morning. I'd blame the men, they just couldn't hang with me! They were immature! Yet I was the one blacking out on my dates, and not remembering what torturous thing I'd inflicted on these poor suitors. Sorry guys!¬†

Like a lot of us, things came to a head during the pandemic. I had tried moving across the country, but had only succeeded in introducing a party drug to my repertoire that let me drink more. White magic! Yet I was still so, so lonely. My friends were party friends, my dates still going well until my inevitable Jekyll and Hyde blackout routine I continued to pull. Something had to change.

My final night drinking is one I prefer not to relive, but I blacked out, embarrassed myself beyond repair, and lost some friendships. I relived that night doused in a greasy coat of shame for months and months. I woke up after that morning and in my coat of shame knew that I needed to stop drinking. There was no challenge this time, no thirty days and I'll be fine, I knew in my gut I needed to quit for the foreseeable future. So I did.¬†

I want to hug every single person here on their first days and weeks of sobriety because it is tough. You are a fucking warrior and don't forget it. I ate candy, I sobbed, I ran miles and miles. I spent hours on this sub and I listened to sober podcasts every waking hour. I still didn't have much faith that I could quit, but I saw every day here there were sober people that seemed, dare I say, happy? So I put one foot in front of the other. Literally, I've run 450 miles in the past year. I took to the streets and let alcohol seep out of my skin first, my brain second.¬†

Days turned into weeks. Weeks turned into months. The obsession waned. Every day got a little bit easier. The typical cliches, but they are true for a reason. That pill I was looking for? The ""click"" to quit drinking? I found it in This Naked Mind. God Bless Annie Grace, because she was the first person to tell me it wasn't my fault. And I believe her.¬†

After 90 days it felt as though sobriety was my choice, not a punishment for my last night of drinking. I woke up and chose to be sober every day. It felt like I had found a life hack, life didn't need to be a constant struggle every day? I can complete daily tasks, end the day accomplished, without having to apologize to someone every single day? My whole life I had wanted to be normal, in a nice apartment, with a nice job, a caring partner.¬†

I have all of those now, and a lot more. I've spent time making my home beautiful. My career is in the highest arc it's ever been, with management opportunities in my immediate future. I woke up next to the love of my life today, one that's supported my journey with such ethos and positivity that I still feel undeserving of.¬†I'm not yet 30, but I finally feel like my life is beginning.

I will not lie to any of you, things are slower now. I'd say boring, but a welcome boring from the chaos that used to be my life. There is no drama to engulf in every weekend, but I am beginning to carve out who I am as a person for the first time. A person who feels things extremely deeply, a person who is reliable and loyal, a person that I am with the glaze of alcohol washed off. I welcome boredom now, I am no longer chained to my drunken mistakes. 

So my newer friends, looking for reprieve anywhere, I've been there. I've been you. You may not relate to me, and that's okay. But I'm asking you to have blind faith that you can have everything you want and more. That you don't have to live in destruction any longer, and you can be free from this obsession. It gets easier, and I can't express how grateful I am that I quit. I just wish I had done it sooner.¬†

I love you all. My messages are always open if you need me.¬†",229,1

Some people can just quit and never look back. I‚Äôm not one of those people.

I kept clinging onto the memory of the elated feeling I got when I drank. The warmth I felt, how my anxiety melted away. So naturally I would get curious and drink again. After all, I‚Äôve had a lot of sober time, so it should feel like the first time, right?

No!!!

Let‚Äôs say that the first year or two of my drinking felt like fireworks. Well, every time I picked something up after 2017 it felt like a spark. No, it felt like if I was watching a spark from 50 feet away. So I‚Äôd keep drinking and of course humiliated myself in the process.

I assumed after a week, a month, a year, my body would reset, that I wouldn‚Äôt get diminished returns, but no. Every time I go on a bender it‚Äôs not a fun party kind of drunk. It‚Äôs a batshit ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to roam the streets like a zombie or stay home and blackout‚Äù type of drunk.

1. It makes me feel so drained afterward. Like, a heavy mental and physical exhaustion.

2. It makes me feel disoriented and bloated.

yeah, I know it‚Äôs not good to have even one and if I tried this at any other point in my life, it would lead to disaster. Many people try to do this and it ends up worse than before. I only mention it to tell others that it‚Äôs honestly not worth it to satisfy the curiosity.

I spoke with my landlord; he wanted 3k from me by last Monday or else I was getting evicted so I just kind of resigned myself to the fact it would happen and didn't say/do anything. The day he was supposed to arrive, I waited anxiously but he never showed up. He just left a notice on my door. I called him, we talked things out and he wants me to ""come up with a plan"" by the end of the month and we can move forward from there - which bought me some time. 

I, of course, spent most of the money on stupid things (pizza and alcohol) and ended up paying an extra $10 in the end because I left my phone at the liquor store and had to pay for a taxi to pick it up.

In the early weeks of sobriety, I think I smoked it twice (bearing in mind that I smoke weed normally 3 times a year max). Last night I was annoyed that I wanted my ""buzz"", so I gave in, and had some weed.

I've now come to the realization that my sobriety isn't just about my health. It isn't about the hangovers. It's about none of that. It's taken me 80+ days to realize I love having my mind clear at all times.

I hated being high last  night. That made my resolve to not drink even stronger. At least weed doesn't make me feel like garbage the next day, and doesn't make me want to binge. Had it been booze, it would.

So thanks to the marvels of Marijuana, I've now learnt that even that ""feeling"" I thought I loved, I actually fucking hate.

Edit: This has been a fascinating read. I've enjoyed all of the comments. Just as a disclaimer (since some dimwit misinterpreted this whole post), I am not slating the usage of weed. If it works for you and helps your alcohol sobriety... Fantastic! It's just simply not for me.

From the acres of land dedicated to growing grapes and hopps.

All for a culture that has people going downhill in life, assaults, DV, DUIs, health issues, emotional issues, etc

I remember even the good times always ended with someone puking or tripping and falling.  

It just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning Friends! I'm looking forward to hosting this week, the check-in is a part of my daily practice now and it' s a privilege to be talking to you all. I guess a content warning would be responsible - I'm going to discuss religion here from an atheist point of view. No offense meant to those with faith, nothing but respect for that.

Some of you may have noticed that you don't often see me around here on a Sunday, and there's a reason for that  - as part of my process of priotitising recovery I started  to take what I call a ""digital sabbath"". That is, one day each week I switch off my phones and computers and just exist in the world. The important people know so they don't panic (the first time I went for a Sunday a.m. walk without my phone I came back to my SO in tears so yeah, learn from my mistake there) but generally it's good to take a day and just be.

My parents are religious people - the Church of Scotland which is a particularly dour part of of Christian faith - so as such I grew up with all sorts of prohibitions around what could be done on 'sabbath'. My local park used to chain up the swings in the kids playground on a Sunday, just in case any errant eight-year-olds had any heathen notions about having fun. When I started to question - and eventually lost - the faith in my teens I had a talk with my Dad about it. He's a scientist, surely he didn't believe all this? 

His response was that he takes the bits that work and ignores the rest. There are bits that really do work for them about community and taking care of others, so he takes those bits and uses them. When I started to focus on getting myself better I realised that taking a day for myself, a day to just play games with my kids and bake bread and generally just get up to whatever I felt like uninterrupted was a luxury that I wanted to give myself - and I'm glad I did. Switching off your phone feels like an act of rebellion.

These days, I don't wanna be bothered with anything that's gonna trigger me if I'm not fully prepared to participate while sober. Surprisingly, the alcohol doesn't trigger me as much as I thought it would, thank goodness for quitting cold turkey. But, the shouting matches and arguments and cursing up a storm does. Certain things I see on the internet and television do remind me of when I had shouting matches with someone I know or did something terrible that cost a friendship...while still battling a drinking problem. Anger, sadness, and depression played a part in all.

I've created a program in my brain over the years, that when I am thirsty or even slightly dehydrated, I want BEER. 

Beer does two things. One, it temporarily hydrates me (followed by more dehydration), and Two, it numbs the pain of being dehydrated, thus not allowing me to feel like I am dehydrated anymore. 

I notice that when a massive craving for beer hits me, if I chug a bottle of water, the craving 4 times out of 5, disappears. 

All the years of my brain associating thirsty = drink beer, has really messed me up. 

Next time you are craving a beer, try chugging some water and see if you have this same problem I do.",15,0

We hung out for around three hours and it was even more sobering than my last drinking binge.

She has been in AA for three years and goes to meetings every day.  She says she has no friends outside the program, has no activities outside the program, and feels totally lost.  She doesn't know how to make friends anymore.  She was sobbing in my arms, telling me she was supposed to be showing me the benefits of AA, but she just doesn't have anyone to go to anymore.  She just broke up with her boyfriend and everyone is telling her to go to her sponsor rather than listening to her.

This was totally terrifying.  I started going sober before I lost my friends and family, so I still have a great support system around me, and I have the money for a therapist and such, but she has nothing.

I did this so I could walk from the parking lot to the office entrance, then hide in my office until the sweating (and shaking) stopped. I held off meetings until 11a because I needed ‚Äúfocus time,‚Äù when really, I just needed to stop sweating. Sometimes my coffee cup contained liquor to get me ready by 11a.

The last time I went to the Emergency Department to detox, the nurses changed my gown and my bedding at least three times because I sweated through them completely, soaking them with acrid, ice cold sweat. They covered me with warm blankets because I was shivering so, so hard. 

I used to sleep with bath towels under me, which I‚Äôd soak through in an hour. I'd wake up and change them, often with a drink to put me back to sleep.

I convinced myself I am just a sweaty guy. It turns out, I‚Äôm not. I think it took 2 weeks after I set down the bottle, but the hyperhidrosis stopped. Now I sweat when I exert myself (but not as much as I used to). Everything I wear doesn‚Äôt reek. Everything I wear doesn‚Äôt need immediate washing to keep the funk at bay. I don‚Äôt have tell-tale sweat stains under my arms or over my entire torso. My underwear isn‚Äôt constantly soaked, and I can wear light-colored pants now because I don't soak them. I don't have to wash my sheets on the daily. My partner is cool hanging out on my side of the bed with me. 

And I‚Äôm not embarrassed to be seen in public, at 7a meetings, or anywhere else, at any other time.

As I was driving around town today, with the seat heater on because I wanted the heat to relax my back, it dawned on me that I haven‚Äôt been able to do that for years. Part of me was hot, but it wasn‚Äôt sweating. And I didn't have the air conditioning on. It felt good.

Not drinking has allowed me to create some amazing changes in my life. Sweating may sound like a trivial thing, but if you are a drunk like me, it‚Äôs a sign that something (or everything) is all fucked up.

At dinner the kids wanted to play on the playground and I was the only adult willing to take them. My partner knocked a full glass of beer over and shattered the glass. I ran around with the kids and explored on the lawn surrounding the outdoor area where we ate. I regretfully allowed my brother in law to drive us home. My sister went to bed early, so I decorated for my nieces bday which we are celebrating tomorrow. Currently I‚Äôm sweating on an air mattress next to my partner while he snores (drunk pass out).

 I wanted to share this with you all because, when I first stopped drinking, it was kind of a big deal.
When I was drinking, I thought about drinking a lot - most of the day. When I quit drinking, I obsessed about drinking - I thought about it constantly. And one of the things I most hoped and prayed for was to just not think about it anymore! I wanted to have a normal way of thinking where alcohol wasn‚Äôt constantly on my mind. 
At some point, maybe 6 months in, it stopped being an obsession. Then, for maybe 2 years, I‚Äôd think about it but be happy that I had the strength and the health to not drink. I was happy to not drink.
And, I‚Äôd say for the last 6-8 months, I‚Äôll go days and days and drinking and alcohol never even cross my mind. I‚Äôm busy with a hundred other much more interesting things and I never even think about it. It‚Äôs peaceful, I‚Äôm not tormented, my mind and thoughts are at rest.

I live in the middle of a pretty busy city in Kentucky and there is a local lake they stock with trout in winter and catfish in summer. I was getting home from fishing up there for bass which has been an amazing hidden gem. 

This group of 5 kids all appeared to be age 8 to 12 and they are walking up to the lake and one was struggling with the package his new rod and reel came in. I got out of my car and I‚Äôm not a big guy but I have a big beard and my voice is hoarse because my allergies have been a nightmare and I said ‚Äúyou boys need some help with that?‚Äù And they looked shocked that I even offered to help and I went over cut it open with my pocket knife and tied a hook on it and they asked if I had any advice or extra tackle. 

I had my tacklebox in the  trunk and I have hundreds of baits to choose from gave them a pack of hooks a pack of sinkers and some jigs and told them where I had luck today and what they were biting on and they were all so excited. I went out on my patio to mess with a Pinterest project for my wife. Same gang of kids came back said they each caught several fish and thanked me and then tried to give me back what they didn‚Äôt use. Told them all to hang onto it and keep up fishing. Made their day. 

When I was drinking no way would I be out of bed on a Saturday morning let alone in a kind and generous mood. It made me feel so good to give to some young men who then put what I gave to good use.

I‚Äôd go a week or so without drinking, but only because I had put my body through hell to the point of being bed ridden for 4 of the 7 days.

I need to find ways to unwind, celebrate, kill time, socialize etc. without alcohol. I need to be ok with boredom, and learn how to be leisurely without cocktails.

Then a lockdown happened, I feel pretty defeated that all my work in trying to establish a routine went out the window. I'm trying to work/study remotely while looking after a boisterous and potentially ADHD child, on top of being stuck at home without much adult companionship. I drink to deal with the anxiety, I drink to unwind, I drink out of boredom, and I drink to put myself to sleep cause ritalin is keeping me awake! 

I'm becoming one of those Wine Mums, I don't drink around my child but it definitely makes dealing with him in the morning more challenging. I'm finding myself dreading when I run out of wine, it's like I need a constant supply of it to feel secure. I'm also dreading when the lockdown is over and I have to face the consequences of my drinking. Life in lockdown is like in limbo where I can deny the existence of a problem, but the hammer's gonna drop and I can't continue living like this.

Idk if it's feasible for me to cut down, maybe one day I will be able to, in the meantime I'd like to go abstinent for a while-- let's say a month! I'm well aware of the complex relationship women have with alcohol, so I'd love to hear from other women and we can support each other!

At that point, I politely made my goodbyes and left ""early."" At first I felt a little guilty, but then I realized that it takes a LOT of energy to be fully 100% present in social situations. In the past, I had been to these types of parties and stayed out chatting all night long and I think it's because the alcohol dulled out some of my presence, so I didn't have to exude as much energy or put as much effort into conversations.

I am not drunk right now, but I say my day one starts tomorrow because I technically haven't gone to sleep yet. 

On Friday, I got to work by 8:00AM (even though I am SUPPOSE to be there at 7:30AM) but because I was drunk the night before and felt like shit it was a struggle to forced myself to get-going. Heck, this was my *first* week at my *new* job and showing up late every day isn't really a good look. After work, I go home and eat a pizza because greasy foods will help settle my stomach, right? Then I invite a few friends over to ""celebrate"" my new job and the first week being complete. A few drinks turned into a few more and that led to a few shots, which led to a few more and before you know it I am putting acid in my drink to have an even better time. To keep the party going. To allow myself to drink even more.

I laughed, I drank, I cried, I drank, I sang my heart out and smoke two packs of cigarettes within 5 hours. Then as the sun started to rise, the anxiety started to set in, ""*Shit,* I have a bunch of SHIT going on today and I haven't slept"" I had to pick up my son, take him to soccer and *then* football. HIS FIRST FOOTBALL GAME. The game he couldn't wait to play. The game he has been counting down the days for and here am I am reeking of booze and cigarettes with not one ounce of fire in me. Not to mention, if he had found out that I started smoking again, his heart would be shattered. I went but I couldn't enjoy myself. It was hot and my teeth hurt from smoking so much and I just wanted to vomit because there wasn't enough water in the world that could replenish all the alcohol that I drank. And boy, did I drink, all the way up until 7AM.

For the last two years, my best friends have been LSD and alcohol.. only to realize that these are not my ""best friends"" and that they are the reasons as to why I am losing my *real* friends and family. Everyone at my ""party"" ended up leaving. They didn't do that. They didn't want to be around it. Not only have I lost people that I love near and dear to my heart, but I have also lost my ""dream"" job. I was there for a year and began learning more responsibilities until I started showing up late everyday. Just rolling out of bed with my hair thrown in a bun and makeup on from last night. I got laid off due to ""covid"" and later would find out that they hired the intern that I trained for my position later on. Maybe, no.. not maybe, but most definitely I know that I would still have my job if I had not been drinking.. or they would have at least called me back for my job.

I blamed the company for laying me off and that's why my drinking and acid intake grew. But in reality, I started this destructive behavior over 4 months before covid hit. 

My son doesn't see me drink or do drugs, but he knows when mommy seems depressed, as he has said in his own words. Which is always a two-day long hangover with a lot of binge eating, crying and laying around. I am not sure how or why or when this all began but this ends TODAY. For the last 5 years, I have showed up late and fucked around and lost two jobs. I just started a new one after looking for *a year* and there is no way in hell I am going to let another opportunity slip out of my hands. I am fucking determined. 

I've been a long-time lurker on this account and I just want to say that each and everyone of you and not only helped me realize what a shit bag I have turned into, but you have all inspired me to become a better mother, worker, friend and family member. I just want to be able to wake up and not hate the person staring back at me. I want the tears to stop falling and get back up and take charge of my life.

All my wasted talent has gone completely out the window. All the days that I've spent in bed crying because I missed my son but I didn't want him to see me hungover or upset and wanted him to have fun so I sent him off to his grandparents. I need to be with him. He is my whole heart. We used to be so close and the past 5 years my drinking has put such a strain on our relationship. 

I would say wish my luck, but there is no luck. There is no more try. There is only doing from this point forward.

I plan on attending AA virtually because I am a little on the shy side and most 100% embarrassed about the hole that I have dug myself into.

So I‚Äôm on Day 4 after a 9-day relapse. The beginning was social (1-2 glasses per night). But: The last few days of that relapse were very bad (2 bottles of wine/day, very little food).

I think I know the answer to this already but, you know: it‚Äôs therapeutic to write it down.

I‚Äôm well on the way to feeling ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. Sleep is mostly fine, no sweating, semi-good appetite.

But out of nowhere this evening (after a good day!) I got a sudden, almost existential ‚Äúwho am I? What is life? What are any of us doing here?‚Äù moment of unease. 
Pulse slightly rapid, a bit of nausea, but nothing like a typical panic attack.
I breathed (and yes - had a cigarette or three) through it, and it passed after 10-20 minutes but‚Ä¶ wow. It scared me. 

I know it‚Äôs probably my brain chemistry resetting - and that will go on for a while. But it shocked me.

I'm not allowed at work until I prove my PEth is reasonable (not that I've ever drank at work, been drunk at work, or considered drinking at work). It's been 4 weeks of nothing. They think they're helping by ""letting me focus on me"" but it's making everything so much harder.

We have a mini break booked next week. The idea of not having a glass of wine at dinner is distressing to me. I know it can't be just one, and even if it is, the next time it wouldn't be. It'll never be just one. It'll never be ""just when I'm out"", ""just one or two"", ""just this time"".

I'm trying to remind myself that these feelings pass. Reading here is a massive help - I've only been around a couple of days but already I can relate to so many posts. You're all wonderful and I appreciate each of your journeys.

376,2021-08-28 13:22:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pddybd/observational_field_research/,Observational field research,"Last night I went out with my best friend, for the first time in almost 5 years. We're both women in our 40s, have been friends for close to 20 years, but a big part of our friendship was always partying. After I quit drinking, we became distanced, only occasionally getting together with our kids, or running errands together, but we havent really gone out or anything. Around 2018, I started going to concerts by myself, sober. I love my music, and will drive 4-5 to see a band I love. It's a great feeling to know I can drive myself home without worries LOL(Sorry if this gets long; I'll try to skip all the gory details. TL;DR- drunk friend is embarrassing LOL)

So one of my favorite artists played last night at the beach, about a 2 1/2 hour drive, and I invited my friend along. She was considerate enough to ask if I minded if she drinks. Of course i dont, that's her thing, Im just going to dance! Well, she started drinking before we were on the highway, a big water bottle filled with margaritas. The ride was fun..until she ran out of booze about an hour into the trip. Then there was no more fun conversation, all she could talk about was needing more booze ASAP. We all know exactly how that feels, I'm sure. But I gotta admit, it got old quick, and a little annoying.

Once we parked and got to the venue (a 3-level beach bar; first floor is right on the boardwalk, an upstairs indoor bar, and the rooftop where bands play) Before we could even go inside, we had to belly up to the bar. I ordered a $3 Sprite, and she got a $10 margarita. We did a walk-around, checking out the people, etc, and she had to stop to get another before we made our way upstairs. I got a good spot by the stage, and she proceeded to get trashed. I danced all night, sweat my arse off, and she was just all over the place! Upstairs, downstairs, outside, out-back smoking weed with strangers.  She was bugging people, touching people who didn't want to be touched, trying to get people to dance with her. I saw people giving her the funny looks, heard 2 guys talking about ""the saucy girl."" I love her dearly, but I was embarrassed for her.  She kept saying ""I cant help it, I'm a social butterfly!"" But to me, she seemed more like a social mosquito LOL. She did keep bringing me cups of water, which I appreciated because I was in the groove, literally dripping sweat, but didnt wanna leave my spot. Between sets, I went with her to get another drink and she introduced me to the bartender as ""This is my friend Ami. She DOESNT DRINK!"" I countered with ""That's okay, SHE drinks enough for both of us!""

The walk back to the parking garage was awful. It was several blocks of boardwalk, it should've taken us maybe 15 minutes, but I had to drag her away from every bar we passed. ""Let's just get one more drink! Come on, just one shot and we'll leave..."" I had to get tough and physically lead her away from the bars, like 3 or 4 times. Then I got the pouting, foot-stamping, ""You're no fun anymore!"" accusations, which I was honestly expecting at that point. She also kept stopping to try to talk to every random person we passed on the street, tripping on the curb, dropping her bag, etc.  I managed to convince her to get a burger instead of a shot, and got myself a large icy Pepsi. Eating the burger kept her focused on the walk and we made it back to the car.  Oh, and I had to buy the burger because she was out of money LOL

The ride home was great. Within 20 minutes, she had the seat reclined, feet on the dashboard and was snoring away. I cranked my tunes, followed the GPS and it was actually a nice relaxing ride! She texted me this morning to thank me for bringing her, she had so much fun, she's sooo hungover hehe! I got up early and got McD's breakfast with my daughter, went school-clothes shopping, and tonight we're gonna go catch a movie at the drive-in theatre. My friend made it from her bed to the couch, with no money, and literally nothing to show for it. She must've blown $100 last night. I spent $60 on band shirts and stickers, and still came home with money in my wallet. We both definitely had fun, but we had very different experiences!

In conclusion, seeing the drunk-girl I used to be, through sober eyes, has killed any idea of FOMO or temptation that could possibly rear up. I wouldn't trade places with her for anything!

This will be the longest period of time not drinking since I actually drank alcohol for the first time (14 years ago).

I already planned to stay sober in January, but I was in a bad mindset and made it only 7 days. Since I discovered this awesome subreddit some months ago, I got very inspired by all your experiences in quitting alcohol. Yes, it's my goal to quit drinking completely one day, but for now I want to stop for one whole month. 

It's not gonna be too hard for me to stay sober from Sunday to Thursday, the days I fear are Friday and Saturday. I usually drink at least on one of those 2 days, but I'm already making plans for weekend activities and rewards for myself, other than beer.

I can‚Äôt just take ‚Äúa little adderall‚Äù to help me get through a difficult work project. (I don‚Äôt have ADHD nor am I prescribed.) If I take any amount, I‚Äôm constantly convincing myself that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt really feel it‚Äù and probably need just a bit more.

Same deal with cocaine. If I‚Äôm at a show, I can‚Äôt even pay attention to the music because all I‚Äôm thinking about is getting to the bathroom for my next bump. Staff must think I either have a cocaine problem or IBS.

Shrooms? I do this thing where I convince myself I should ‚Äújust eat a couple caps/stems to have some fun while cleaning the house.‚Äù (lol) As you could probably imagine‚Ä¶ never have i ever eaten shrooms and then gone on to actually clean my house. Typically it ends up with me deciding to eat ‚Äújust a couple more‚Äùuntil all of the sudden I‚Äôm tripping fucking balls on the couch by myself on a Tuesday night. 

Xanax? Phew, I‚Äôm glad I had the wherewithal to nip that in the bud before I fell too far down the rabbit hole. During my brief Xanax stint, I would eat a QB every couple hours because I was just sure I wasn‚Äôt feeling it and I was positive it wasn‚Äôt noticeable to others. I once had a big work presentation with my company‚Äôs senior leadership and  remember feeling like I absolutely killed that shit. My boss pulled me aside afterward and asked if I had been drinking before the meeting‚Ä¶. It was 9 am.

There are obviously plenty of other substances and regardless of what it is, it‚Äôs always the same pattern. I can never even ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù whatever high it is I‚Äôm chasing because I‚Äôm obsessed with feeling it even MORE.

Couple hours later, another shot or two,  keeping the momentum going. This has been my method for the better part of 10 years. A slight buzz SEEMS to make life more interesting and I actually want to do things.

Yes, it‚Äôs the way I‚Äôve been self-medicating depression for a long time. I am on medication again now though so working on that. 

Ive had my share of bad blackout nights, that lead me to stop (luckily this attempt is of my own volition without any major fuck up to drive me here like my past posts) but usually I DO enjoy the ‚Äúkeep a slight buzz going all day and get some shit done‚Äù kind of drinking.

One of his tenants, Bobby, is an older gentleman who's retired from the USPS. Really nice guy, a talker, who lives alone. 

Well, Bobby passed away. He didn't have any family to speak of (nobody knows why), and he died alone sitting in his easy chair with piles, and I mean PILES of empty vodka bottles around him. His place was a mess as you can imagine. 

His landlord (neighbor) hadn't heard from him in several days and we went to check on him. We had to bust open the door and we found him.

This has hit me hard for several reasons: I've known him for years, we got along great, I actually saw him dead in that condition and Vodka was my drink of choice. And now I'm helping my neighbor clean the place up.

But, don't worry. I'm not tempted to drink in the least. In fact, it has furthered my resolve to stay sober. I have no doubt that if I had continued on my previous track, that I would potentially end up being a ""Bobby.""

If you have a substance abuse problem, there's a chance you are self-medicating a mental illness. For me, it was bipolar disorder. This was after years of being diagnosed only with depression (apparently a common misdiagnosis).

I was put on mood stabilizers earlier this year when my diagnosis changed. They took a while to kick in, and then it took a while longer and a disturbing dream about my dad drinking himself to death to decide to stop. 

But I didn't experience any of the cravings that I did all the other times I tried to quit. It didn't occupy my consciousness the way it had the other times. My life didn't magically get better, I'm still depressed more days than not, but at leat this one thing isn't making it worse.

I know that not everyone has access to mental health resources, and not everyone's drinking is rooted in neurological compulsion; but if you have or can get access to a psychiatrist, it might just make a big difference.

Again, not a brag, just hopefully some encouragement for the people who *can* get professional help to actually do it. It took me a while to as well.",7,0

This was immediately post rehab. My girlfriend (we're back together now) had kicked me out, I had no job, I had just left rehab, and I was living in a homeless shelter. Needless to say, staying sober was tough, but I got through it by constantly telling myself, ""I'll drink tomorrow.""

Something that had occurred to me in rehab was that, more than the physical, emotional, and mental tolls that drinking took on me, drinking was a lot of work. I had to find the money for alcohol, buy it, deal with the guilt, find a place to drink, and then deal with the hangovers and interpersonal consequences the next day. Every day of drinking just created a bunch of work for me whenever I was sober, so instead of focusing on the feeling of being drunk, I focused on the work. 

I basically weaponized my procrastination by turning the ""one day at a time"" mentality on its head. Rather than looking at it as ""I need to stay sober for today"" I just told myself that I'll TOTALLY drink, but since drinking is work, I'll do it tomorrow. I told myself that every day until I decided that I just... never wanted to do that work again. So far, it's worked for me! 

I won't drink with you all today, and the way I feel now, I think I won't drink with you tomorrow, too. :)",38,0

Coming to the daily check in was a huge part of my journey and I started coming back during my first trimester when my morning sickness reminded me of my old daily hangovers. 

For anyone that is lurking, I originally starting coming to /r/stopdrinking  in January 2018 after listening to a CBC radio story that recommended that everyone, not just people with drinking problems should take a 30 day break or at least 2 days off a week. At that time both seemed really hard for me but I was around a month away from a trip to Portugal so I used that as an excuse to try my first 30 day AF challenge. 

I lurked often on those 30 days in 2018 and I noticed so many people recommending the book 'This Naked Mind' and how they had zero desire to drink anymore. To be honest the idea of never drinking again made me avoid the book, drinking was my favourite hobby and if I couldn't drink my life would be SO boring. 

It wasnt until February 2020 that I was on another 30 day AF challenge before my winter holiday that I gave Allen Carr's book on controlling alcohol a go. I loved it and it really challenged my ideas on drinking (and boredom) but didnt stop me from drinking on my March 2020 holiday in Tenerife and then REALLY drinking once I was back in Canada, working from home and watching the news 24/7.  My anxiety was through the roof and I was miserable. 

I initially decided I would go for another 30 days AF in April 2020 and the first few days were miserable. I was in such a foul mood that I figured I would finally try Annie Graces book out. By the end of the book something clicked where I realized that if I never drank again...I would never be hungover again and then I had a realization that I had spent a lot of my mornings being hungover but blaming it on something else (sickness, tiredness, crohns, etc.) but the truth was, when I was on my my 30 day challenges I felt great in the mornings and was never 'sick'. 

In May 2020 I extended my 30 day challenge to go 365 days, but by January 2021 I found out I was pregnant, so I knew I wouldnt be drinking after the year was up. I have no desire to drink anymore but I still come back to /r/stopdrinking because I really resonate with a lot of the stories and I really enjoy giving advice when I can (lol I always recommend reading This Naked Life & Alcohol Explained).

I've been in AA for 2 months now, but on Tuesday, my desire for drinking was so loud and overwhelming. I know I have tools to deal with cravings, but that day, I just ignored all my tools, didn't reach out to my sponsor, didn't tell anyone, and drank alone in my flat. 

The next day, there were some leftover bottles in my fridge. I felt guilty about drinking, but I also didnt feel too bad because I convinced myself it could be worse. I decided to work from home, and around 2:30pm, I decided to drink one of the beers. (i'm in Germany where beers are big btw). 

I thought about dumping them in the toilet, but I figured ""whats a few again?""

And, I ended up getting completely wasted. I had a service position in AA (as a greeter) and I completely missed that. When I got a message from the chair saying that its not acceptable that I miss this meeting because its also a business meeting, I started crying and called my sponsor, telling her that he was being mean. (Of course he wasn't being mean, I was just wasted and hysterical).

She then got all 'momma-bear' and almost called him to yell at him (thank goodness she didnt), but this all made me drink more (and keep it a secret of course).

So I end up blacking out, not remembering half of the conversation I had with my sponsor. I know that I need to tell her, but i'm absolutely terrified to tell her. She probably deep down already knows, or blatantly knows since I was a blubbering idiot... but I know I need to come clean, but that makes me want to just crawl into a hole and die.

\- So I'm hoping that this reddit post is the first step to coming clean. I have a cofffee meeting with her tomorrow, and i'm hoping to have the courage to come out and say it.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning / evening, SD and welcome to the Saturday check-in. Thank you so much for the honor of hosting you this week. It has given me an even deeper appreciation for this community and I've soaked in all the sobernaut love over the past 7 days! Special thanks to my buddy u/replacementsstink for encouraging me to host. I encourage you to consider it too! If you have 30 days or more sober, let u/sainthomer know and he'll set you up with everything you need. 

&#x200B;

I want to leave you with this thought: There's not one way to be sober. I literally say this out loud when I'm being hard on myself, or when my day-to-day experience of sobriety is different from my expectation. Sometimes I wonder, why don't I feel super energetic and cheerful today? When am I going to start training for a marathon like so-and-so? It's OKAY, I tell myself. You are enough exactly how you are. So, I'm working on accepting myself for the introverted cat lady that I am. 

&#x200B;

I wish the same for all of you. If you're feeling discouraged today, I can tell you that just by being here, you are doing great. Your sobriety doesn't look like my sobriety or anyone else's and that is OKAY. And if you're celebrating today, I'll celebrate with you! Training for a marathon? I will happily cheer you on with the cat in my lap. 

&#x200B;

With that, I wish you a beautiful Saturday and will see you back in the comments next week. IWNDWYT.",349,0

The problem is that there are so many boxes up there I don‚Äôt know where to start. Everything I‚Äôve ever done is up there, all in different boxes labelled with things like ‚Äú1976 - moving to Derbyshire to look after dying Granny‚Äù, ‚Äú1981 - Mum and dad split up. Off to Doncaster to live with Nan‚Äù, ‚Äú1983 - reconciliation and another move‚Äù, ‚Äú84-90...solvent abuse, alcohol, weed, fast ones, slow ones, rebellion‚Äù. These boxes are easy to deal with. I was young and so were my parents...we were all clueless together. There‚Äôs no real weight to them and they can be shifted easily.
Everything that happened from 1991-2002 goes into the same section of loft with happy face stickers on them. These boxes are full of meeting the woman of my dreams and growing up together. Having the time of our lives and really kicking the arse out of it. 2002-2007 are boxes full of baby photos and blurred feelings of pride and happiness. The feelings aren‚Äôt clear because the thoughts were captured when I was drunk. Booze took the clarity from my childrens formative years. The boxes are heavier but I can rearrange them if I put a bit of effort into it.    

Now I start getting to the really untidy part of the loft. It‚Äôs chaos. The boxes are strewn left and right. Some upside down, others on their sides stacked higgledy piggledy. The majority are as light as a feather and upon inspection contain nothing but crumpled tins of cider, empty pill strips and wraps, wine corks and cobwebs. They can go straight into the skip (recycling the cardboard, obviously). There are some really heavy ones as well. One is labelled ‚ÄúDead Dad‚Äù - in it are memories of the man who tried his best but still failed to find peace - his upbringing putting him on a collision course with the alcoholism that would end killing up him on an operating table at 59. A lot of the heavier memories can go. I can just keep the lighter, happier ones and that will make this box easier to move. He was a gentle, funny man - he would‚Äôve loved his grandchildren as they turned into men. I can hear the banter now. Booze took my dad away from me.    

Another box with a poison sticker is nearly immovable. In that are pictures of my mum. I‚Äôll go right to the bottom and pull out some early ones. We‚Äôre laughing and shouting as she gives me a coggie on her bike. Riding through the countryside to a little pub that sold salt‚Äôn‚Äôshake crisps and lemonade bottles with straws. Another one where she‚Äôs taking me around to a bullies house to confront the mum of the offender. Incredibly joyful holidays away in Devon and Cornwall. Why is this box so heavy? Drunken screaming matches with my dad. Hideous, hateful words being shouted. Pissed up fights, smashed crockery. Drink driving accident and the following panic of potential prosecution all magnified by home brewed wine. Bad decisions that split the family up. Attempted suicide which brought us back together. Another 37 years of fear and hate brought on by daily alcohol consumption. Levelling up her selfishness and vitriol after her soul mate dies. She‚Äôs poiso‚Ä¶...hold up...there‚Äôs an important realisation to be made here. She has had an addiction for nearly 50 years. 50 years of ‚Äòthe terror‚Äô. Half a century of operating from mental and physical dependency. What kind of hell is that? Right, I‚Äôm going to take out all the bad memories caused by her addiction and see what‚Äôs left. Not much...but at least now I can move the box easily. Booze has nearly taken my mum away from me.    

I‚Äôm making progress. Order is being restored.    

‚ÄúGobshite‚Äù is the next label to catch my eye. It‚Äôs full of every drunken conversation I‚Äôve ever had. It‚Äôs a biggun. I can just throw that one away, surely. I try to lift it up and my back pops - there‚Äôs something very heavy in there. I‚Äôm sat on my eldest sons bedroom floor. I‚Äôm 2 bottles of red deep and I‚Äôm regaling him with stories of every drug I‚Äôve ever taken. He‚Äôs 14 years old. I tell myself that the motivation for this discussion is to dissuade him from following in my footsteps. What I‚Äôm actually doing is throwing down a gauntlet. Regardless of what I think of myself, my boy looks up to me. The conversation has the exact opposite effect to the one intended. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, being a pissed gobshite know-it-all. Too busy talking to bother listening. 

Behind that box is a small wooden crate, nailed shut. ‚ÄúDo not open‚Äù is written two times - once in the handwriting of a 13 year old, the other recently added. This box is the heaviest of them all. The lid comes off and contained within are two memories - one of which will stay in the box. 
It‚Äôs mid October 2018. I open the front door to my eldest boy. His eyes are half closed. His skin is pale and clammy. He‚Äôs sway-standing, drifting in and out of consciousness. I‚Äôve been on the booze all day but recognise a very obvious overdose straight away. Do I call an ambulance? No. I bundle him upstairs to his bedroom and get him settled for the night. Through mumbled answers to my questions I find out that he‚Äôs been taking xanax and valium sourced not from a chemist but from some gangster on the internet. The misplaced confidence I feel that I can deal with this situation is caused by my alcohol fuelled cockiness. I videoed him on my phone as he struggled to stay awake‚Ä¶..and then I went downstairs and drank another bottle of wine. The reason why I didn‚Äôt call an ambulance? I couldn‚Äôt be arsed with the bother. It would‚Äôve caused disruption to my planned evening of getting hammered. *'He's not that bad‚Ä¶.I‚Äôve been in worse conditions'* was what my drunken brain was saying. I did spend a little bit of time with him, everytime I went to empty my bladder. Making sure that he was still with us. 
The universe saw fit to keep my boy alive, despite my selfish attempts to ignore what was right in front of my face. 

I carried on drinking for another 16 months after this incident.

In March 2020 I was drunk on that high octane, very cheap cider that comes in 3 litre plastic bottles. I‚Äôd had a couple of them and was swigging, surreptitiously, out of the Gin and Vodka bottles in the drinks cabinet. At some point during that evening my eldest did something to annoy me - he left pee on the toilet seat. I went into his room with a bare fuse. He laughed when I asked him why he hadn‚Äôt wiped the seat and my fuse was lit. I can‚Äôt explain what happened next because I wasn‚Äôt there. No physical violence occurred but in the morning no-one would meet my eyes or speak to me. I had an inkling that I may have been slightly out of order the night before (Brit understatement), but the morning after had never been this bad. I went out into the garden and sulked, hoping that someone would come out and apologize to me.    
 
Yep, you read that right.    

I decided to make myself useful by preparing a bit of garden and planting some onion sets that had been hanging around in the shed. I didn't hold out much hope that they'd grow because they'd been there forever but I put them in anyway. During this time I started thinking about what had happened the night before, trying to remember who had said what to who - but I came up blank. The nagging feeling that *I* was the problem in this situation wouldn‚Äôt go away‚Ä¶.and then it came to me - *My* behaviour the night before was the direct result of the alcohol *I‚Äôd* consumed. It was 100% my doing. That was my ‚ÄòTon of Bricks‚Äù moment. I went into the house and apologised to my wife, youngest son and old fella in the living room - this was met with picture-no-sound (to be fair the old fella couldn't hear what I was saying), but the apology was out in the open now. I‚Äôd admitted that I had a problem with booze and I was going to get help to try and stop. I went upstairs to find my eldest lad and apologised to him with the same words. He shook his head and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that before. You just say words. You're just like Nan‚Äù.    

So that's how I got the initial injection of energy to change my ways. I stopped drinking and put out the feelers to a local group that wasn't AA. I had plenty of mis-guided preconceptions about AA at the start. The local group was shut down because of COVID-19. I could do this thing on my own, without any support.    
Holy shit! Those first couple of months were so bloody hard! My junkie brain was laughing his tits off and rubbing his hands together in glee. It was only a matter of time before I fell off the wagon in spectacular fashion. The reasons for stopping were still very raw and I was under no illusions that I wouldn't lose everything if I went back to the bottle - but I was still contemplating it. The justification of an alcoholic is a force to be reckoned with. Man!....I was so close to folding.     

""If nothing changes, nothing changes"".....every past attempt at stopping had followed the same miserable pattern. A couple of days/weeks/months of stubborn dryness, a boozy reward for doing well, the self deluded bullshit that is moderation and the inevitable walk down the path back to black out drinking. This time around I admitted to myself that I didn't have the answers. I couldn't do this on my own. I reached out for support.    
I came here in June 2020 and, during the following weeks, got involved. I read everything. I got brave enough to post and ended up having a conversation that changed my whole outlook.    
These days I'm always banging on about doing stuff and being active in sobriety but back then I was still asking ""Why am I like this?"". Luckily, a long term member with thousands of days sober took the time to explain that I was looking at it all wrong. ""What am I going to **DO** about it?"" was the question I *should've* been asking. This was a huge deal for me. It put the power firmly into my hands. All of my preconceptions were binned and every option was on the table. I *wanted* to stop drinking and I was going to try all of it on and see what fit. AA meetings helped. I went to my first one at 200 days sober. I just listened in and empathized with people all around the world who were just like me. I have absolutely no doubt that I would‚Äôve had a similar experience at any of the non-AA groups - the feeling of connection and shared experience is the river that runs through every country on the map of recovery. I read books and cherry picked passages that resonated with me. I tried meditation and mindfulness. I spoke to my doctor. I spoke to my family. I spoke to other sober people. 
There's so much stuff that I haven't tried yet, but I know it's there - and if I ever need it I'll get it.   
Out of all the things I've tried, Stop Drinking is my number one support. It works so well for me. The connections I've made with the people here have helped me no end. Being given an opportunity to help someone else by talking about things that I've experienced has ended up helping me. It's that simple. I reckon it's all about knowing where I've come from. As long as I always remember I've got a problem, I won't have a problem. That's why you'll see my 'IWNDWYT üôÇ' everyday‚Ä¶. signaling my morning/afternoon read of new posts that pour into this sub every minute.     
To all the lurkers who have landed here and got this far - I can only talk about my own experiences. I can tell you that getting involved in posts and talking from the 'I' has helped me build the longest stretch of sobriety since the age of 17. It's helped to open up my mind to new ways of thinking and allowed me to connect with an anonymous gang of superheroes who will always have time to offer listening ears, support and compassion.
Being sober hasn't fixed every broken thing in my world but it *has* made my life a much nicer place to be. My mind is blown everyday when I see evidence of my positive life improvements spreading out and affecting the reality of others. It's a reeeaaaall trip!

I know they are a heavy drinker, apologizing the mess they are with 'I do it for our company.' Meanwhile, all I have in my head are the thoughts about how far I finally got without drinking. I wouldn't be able to move up in my career without discipline and I would never be able to do my job excellently as the drunkard I was.

I knew I had a drinking problem before my father came to help me clean my pigsty of an apartment, but the concept of alcoholism never crossed my mind. And when we sat down for a Zoom session with the therapist we both see, I was at ease with her suggestion of abstaining from alcohol for a week to ""reset my relationship"" and make sure I can still enjoy drinking in a healthy, non-addictive, non-escapist way.

I gave my stash to the homeless neighbor who'd become my drinking buddy for the last couple of months and got through the week with relative ease. Instead of Gatorade bottles sneakily filled with appropriately colored alcohol, I brought lemonade to work to drink throughout the day. And when the 8th day rolled around and ended with me enjoying a nice dinner out with my incredible dad, I agreed to his request that I continue to stay away from alcohol. 

It wasn't until the 10th day that realization began to sink in and the cravings appeared. I went to my first AA meeting that day (yesterday) and found myself at peace in the cozy basement surrounded by honest people who welcomed me and cheered when I announced my day count. But I also thought before, during, and afterwards that I was some kind of imposter. That I don't really have a chemical dependency because I didn't experience withdrawal or intense cravings. And then I tried to convince myself I was making up the cravings I was now having in order to relieve that imposter syndrome.

Well, the cravings and insatiable desire to get totally fucked up only got worse today so I hit up a meeting before work and another one after. First meeting felt great, I shared for the first time and was told I was in the right place. Still managed to spend the rest of the day agonizing over whether or not I was actually an alcoholic, though. And the meeting tonight was fine, but also saw me struggling with the notion of being an alcoholic.

The taxi ride home (the meeting was near my workplace, the meetings in my neighborhood are still closed unfortunately) had me continuing to ruminate while simultaneously calculating which bodegas would still be open and how much I could drink without compromising my ability to walk my dog. And then it finally hit me.

The first 9 days were easy because I saw them solely as a means to an end. Honestly, it was a galaxy brained move on the part of my therapist because if I had thought the week without booze would end with me having to accept that this is a permanent monkey on my back, I never would've agreed to it.

I guess rock bottom for me right now looks less like blacking out and more like having to imagine the rest of my life with an illness I can't control.

I'm an alcoholic with 11 days sober and I will not drink with you today.

TL;DR Being sober for a week felt like a fucking cakewalk because I thought it would only be for a week. Now I see that I'm an alcoholic and the real work has to begin. And continue for the rest of my life.",27,0

I am so close to being a year sober. A year ago I didn't think I could ever be that person, yet here I am. It really is like they say, one day at a time.
Months 4-10 were a breeze. I've discovered NA beer (thank you O'Doules) and NA wine that always took care of my cravings. Last few weeks however it has been really hard. The world seems to just be crumbling around me. I have a lot of stress at work, family tradegy, might have to cancel my wedding because of another covid wave, the list just goes on. Lately I feel that the future, not just mine but everyone's, is so dim there is no point in trying to be your best self. Fridays are the hardest because at the end of the week I'm usually so tired of fighting. 
I did not drink today. I went to the gym, then for a walk with my dog and ate some cake. I don't really feel any better, but I know drinking would not have done any good for me either. I recognize that the feeling I'm after cannot be bought or induced by drugs. The feeling I'm after is the feeling of freedom. Freedom to do what I truly want to do. I want to travel, I want to learn a million hobbies, rescue all the animals, adopt a child, have a little farm, learn all the things the world has to offer. But I'm stuck going to a soul sucking 9-5 just to come home and finish the night with taking care of dogs, spouse, chores, and then finally zoning out on my phone. 
I know I can at the very least change my job. I am in the process and have been looking for awhile. But job posting after another it gets even more depressing. Every job application out there is for a robot that wants to work all the time and not get paid at all. I have recently asked my current company why we haven't seen pay adjustment this year due to crazy increase in price of living in my area and was told ""well it's hard for everyone now even for people that are in cheaper areas"". Okay, so now we all have to suffer? Why don't we raise pay for all? I see all executives getting millions in bonuses, how can they justify that to themselves? Anyway, that's a whole another topic.
I'm just so tired. I want that feeling of the first beer but even now I recognize that I wouldn't stop at one beer, I would get trashed and then regret it. 
I hope you all are safe out there and have someone you can talk to. I love this community and it has gotten me through dark times before, we will get through this one as well ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

Today is Day 1 Quitting Forever!","**;TLDR: Hallucinated, voices, almost went to ER, felt I was near death, hit rock bottom, tapered my alcohol intake down, and now quitting 100%.**

[First note, as per the rules, I am 100% sober writing this].

I went through a separation (and soon divorce) of a 20 year long marriage. Lost my wife, house, job, physical access to my son, and 6 pets (birds/dogs/cats), all in one instant. This was due to drug abuse (not alcohol, much harder things).

I cleaned myself up off all the drugs immediately, but the damage was already done. My way of life was destroyed, and everything I had built over 20 years of work, was gone. At more than 40 years old now, I ended up moving in with my parents, and staying in their house for the next couple of years.

I turned to alcohol to get me through the days. At first, it was just light beers, or whiteclaws. Then eventually it was Tequilla and Vodka mixed with juice of some kind.

I would eventually over the course of two years, find myself drinking all day, and all night. And over the course of the following year, drinking even more.

About two months ago, things took a turn for the worst, and I was drinking Vodka 24/7. About a shot an hour, every hour, all day, all night, and all through my sleep. I would literally wake up once an hour due to complete insomnia, take another shot, and pass out again. After 10 hours of sleeping, I'd have done 10 shots. Then continue through the day. My long distance vision, which was always sharp, suddenly was very blurry. I could see up close fine, but far away was horrible and squinting my eyes didn't help. I at the time chalked it up to old age, and didn't consider it was from the alcohol.

Then one morning, I woke up, went to get my shot of vodka, and saw something strange. There was a spider-web stuck to my arm. I swiped at it with my other hand, to get rid of it, and that's when a look of horror came across my face... There was no spider-web, I was hallucinating. For the next two weeks, in the mornings, and at night, whenever I moved my left or right arms/hands through the air, a ghostly perfect outline trail that looked like it was made of spider webs would follow my hand about 1 second delayed. There was only ONE ghostly outline trail, not many. This wasn't like trails you might see on LSD where it's your hand trailing like a snapshot or blur, no. This was a single ghostly spider-web outline of a hand trailing my hand 1 second in delay as I moved it through the air.

It was both kind of cool on a deranged level, as I didn't know the human mind could produce this kind of visual disturbance, but also it was very scary because it made me feel like something was deeply wrong.

Then, after about two weeks of this, I remember waking up in the morning, laying there with my eyes closed when suddenly my mother bursts into my room, and says ""Hey, are you ready now to go to the hospital?"". It scared the shit out of me, like in a startling way and I suddenly thought, ""what the hell, no I am not going to any hospital I am fine"", and then I sat up in bed, looked towards the door where she came in, and... Nothing. She wasn't there. She didn't come into the room. I hallucinated it completely. It was so real, and nothing like that happened to me ever before.

After some contemplation about this, I laughed it off, but now in hindsight, I could see it was some kind of higher power or deep inner knowing warning me of what was about to happen.

Another week goes by and it was time for my brother and I to take a road-trip across country so I could get some things out of storage. I proceeded to take Gatorade bottles, dump some out, then fill the rest of the empty space back up with Vodka. This was so I could drink in the car on the road-trip, and he wouldn't be any wiser. I was hiding my alcoholism from him from my sense of deep shame and embarrassment.

Then, the first night in the hotel, we each had our own room, and I over-did it. I got the bottle of Vodka out of my suitcase that I brought, and proceeded to do my shots to get to bed. The ghost trails were everywhere. It looked like spider-webs were attached to my arms and then suddenly I kept hearing people talking in the room with me. I would spin around and look, and no one was there. Then someone would call my name again behind me, of which I would spin around and no one was there.

I suddenly started having massive muscle cramps, all through my body. My legs were locked up, my kidneys hurt. A voice in my head kept saying ""You're going to die now, it is time."". I'm drenched in sweat, and I stink a foul disgusting scent as the alcohol is just permeating my skin. Eventually I pass out.

The next day, I wake up, do a few more shots, see the spiderweb trails again and I begin to finally realize, I am going to die if I don't stop drinking. So I decide I am done and didn't drink any alcohol all day on the next leg of the road-trip.

I am feeling pretty good, and that night we check into the hotel and it's about 10:30pm. I take the vodka from my suitcases and dump them down the sink. I empty the Gatorade bottles, and dump them down the sink. Then I try to get ready for bed.

As midnight approaches, I notice I am getting extremely anxious. It has been about 12 hours since my last drink and I feel like I am jumping out of my skin. I feel very dehydrated and the audio hallucinations are back. I keep hearing, ""It is time to go to the hospital"" from both inside my head and from imaginary people who aren't in the room with me. Then I realized that the hallucination of my mom coming into the room in the morning waking me up asking if I was ready to go to the hospital, wasn't just a hallucination, it was a premonition.

The voice says again, ""You're about to die, are you ready?"". I start panicking, thinking ""no, no no!!"". It's about midnight and I start packing up my room so I could go to the hospital. The whole time, this voice keeps saying ""Time for the hospital and you are going to SUFFER"". It takes me about 30 minutes and everything is ready to go, but I am frozen... I feel like I can't move. I feel incredible anxiety and like I am jumping out of my skin.

I decide to go to the bathroom, and I go to pee in the toilet and it BURNS. The pain was incredible. It felt like I was pissing straight vodka. I again panicked more. I tried to fold the toilet paper to wipe my butt and I was shaking so bad that I could barely do it. My hands were like I had Parkinson's disease. I then looked up online quitting alcohol, and that's when I learned you can't just quit cold-turkey and you can easily die if you try.

I start chugging water so that I can try to pee without it burning. And then I realized, my brother has some alcohol in his hotel room. I started banging on his door at nearly 2am, wake him up and get the alcohol from him. He hands me the beer and I go back into my room.

I decided, I either have to taper right now, or I have to go to the hospital. I decided to taper as the idea of going to the hospital in the state I was in, felt like it would be pure torture. I know this was stupid, I was risking my life.

So I set a timer on my phone, and only allowed myself 1/2 a can of beer every hour. I drank that first 1/2 can, and my anxiety and ""feeling like jumping out of my skin"" instantly subsided. I felt calm again. I then waited, an hour, and drank another half. The next morning, I broke down in the car crying and told my younger brother that I was an alcoholic. I told him about my plan to try to taper, and he lovingly supported me. Every few hours, we'd pull over and I'd have a beer, then we'd get back on the road.

Two days later, the spider-web ghost trails stopped and my long-distance vision suddenly returned. I could see again! And no more trails!

I drank less and less over the next few weeks, eventually switching to ultra-light beer, and in the last few weeks only drinking right before bed, not at all during the day.

Last night (24 hours ago) was my last time I drank 3 to 4 ultra-light beers (4.2%ABV) around 10pm through 1am or so when I went to sleep and one ultra light beer in the middle of the night. I didn't drink at all when I woke up or during the day. While my mood isn't the best during the day, it is pretty good and I don't think about alcohol all day long now.

Since I feel pretty clear headed all day, and my desire to drink is nearly gone, I am officially quitting now now. If I feel too anxious or panicky again I will re-evaulate, but I don't think that will happen.

I feel really good about being completely sober now. Tonight, I'll go to bed without drinking. I'll keep an eye on how I feel to make sure I don't get into any sense of trouble.

That was close... I am glad I didn't die, and glad I hit that rock-bottom to quit. I thank god for those voices that scared the shit out of me, for they saved my life. I am really excited to get completely sober, get all my energy back, stable mood, and my old-self of who I was prior to this 20 year marriage falling apart.

If I need it, I'll see a doctor, or go to AA. Since I've been doing so well I am going to give myself a shot here first. And if I can't do it, I'll get more help. I told my brother about my problem since then, and he's also keeping an eye on me and supporting me. I'll also let my doctor know that I went through and have him run liver-tests etc...

Aug 27th, 2021 is my first day with nothing in three+ years. It's been 24 hours since my last drink, and I feel really surprisingly great right now. Here we go, wish me luck!",96,0

Sharing numbers, etc.  Went to my first in person meeting yesterday, met a bunch of people.

Today, several of those people friended me on social media.  Various platforms.  I did not tell them my last name, so they literally sought me out.

Is this... Normal?  I thought the whole point of this was to be anonymous.

It's a huge turn off from this process.  I'm still at the stage here where I'm ashamed and trying to come to grips with needing help, I don't want to share memes yet.

I don't drink in the morning, I don't drink during the day, I don't drink and drive, I drink at home at night to avoid my home life. I drink so that I can pass the fuck out and not have to deal with my personal life.

I was on day 5 today but I drank because of whatever excuses are usual. I had a long week, I had a long day, I don't have anything to do tomorrow, I can deal with the hangover.

I haven't had a day five in probably three years. The difference was that I finally decided that I wanted to divorce my husband of almost 10 years.

My sleep got better immediately. My insomnia almost disappeared. But still here I am drinking after 5 days sober. Because I justified the fact that it's been a ridiculous week.

I wonder if anyone else has had success in moderating or quitting entirely after deciding to divorce or having the divorce finalized. I drink because I'm miserable and I want to escape my life.

I am feeling really depressed and guilty about the whole thing, like a failure, disappointed in myself, but I read something somewhere that the only thing needed for success is the willingness to suffer a thousand failures. I'm not drinking again today, I am starting over my sober clock instead of letting this justify spiraling into a bender. I am resilient and I can beat it. I won't stop quitting.

I was hospitalized twice in the Spring with issues relating to alcohol and not taking care of myself in general.

Earlier this month (8/9), I completely bombed yet another interview. (I was sober this time though!) I let myself feel shitty for a couple hours, and I tried to nap the feeling off, but when I woke back up I couldn't shake it. I went straight to the liquor store. I figured I would drink for a day or maybe two to calm my nerves and then pick myself back up into normal life. Nope, went on a 11-day binge of course. Probably 500-750mL 80¬∞ each day. Like others here, I had horrible anxiety and racing heart each day after a half week of that, and finally on 8/16 I knew I had to taper for a couple days and get my shit together. I was having another panic attack.

It's been over a week since I had my last drink, and I've made a concerted effort not only to stay stopped-drinking but also cooking at home, trying to get some outdoor time (in this heat ugh), and working on getting a doctor's follow-up appointment that I missed during my binge.

I realized that my Fitbit was going the whole time, and I figured the heart rate data would be interesting since all last week my heart was pounding. [I didn't know it would be this dramatic](https://imgur.com/a/uDD1Qcc). During the height of my binge, my *resting* heart rate was almost 90bpm, after being 65 almost the entire sober part of my summer. What blew my mind is how quickly I managed to recover, after 4 days of really shitty withdrawal symptoms. The body really is a miracle when it's treated decently.

If you're nerdy like me and love numbers, this is another small hack to stay stopped - look at the numbers. Just like my doctor tells me my cholesterol is high, so stop eating so much fast food, Fitbit tells me my heart rate is quite high, time to reconsider life choices as well. I don't need an appointment to get a liver panel done to see this; I can measure this at home.

Sometimes even though I ""know"" I'm broken and absolutely without a doubt must avoid alcohol, I need a friend like my Fitbit to remind me, it's just not worth it. Thanks also to everyone posting their stories. It helps me knowing none of us is alone. No drink will make any of this better.",11,0

So, this happened to me about 8yrs ago, but it‚Äôs always stuck with me, and now that I‚Äôm recovering, I think about it quite a lot and would appreciate any insight or help to get clarity so I can move past it.

I had an apt in nyc that I shared with 4, sometimes 5 people, depending on significant others and subletters. We were all in theater and had crazy schedules, we cooked big meals together, spent holidays together‚Äîwe were truly a family.  

One roommate, and my best friend in the entire world, Jack, was going out of town for a show and had a subletter coming in.  The subletter, Peter, was from the south, like me, so we immediately bonded.  I‚Äôd make southern food, and we‚Äôd have a grand ole time.  Now, two important things to note.  He was sober and attended AA meetings daily.  I was not, and had yet to address my propensity to binge.  I also had a boyfriend at the time, who was there most of the time during our epic meals and hangouts.

One morning I was having breakfast with Peter, when he blurted out of nowhere that he thinks he‚Äôs in love with me, and that I should really think about leaving my boyfriend and being with him.  It was totally bizarre and out of nowhere.  I laughed it off, but it was never the same.  I thought that was completely inappropriate and I had my hackles up anytime I was around him after that. 

Then, one day, I got into a major fight with my boyfriend.  I was crying and sunk my woes into the bottom of a bottle.  I finished the bottle, excused myself from the kitchen table, and went to go netflix it up until I went to sleep.  Peter knocked on my door about 20mins later waving a bottle of whiskey.  He‚Äôd gone out to a liquor store and bought more liquor. As a sober person in AA, he bought liquor.  I‚Äôm not saying sober people can‚Äôt buy liquor, but I found it odd. He was saying how he thought I could use it since my bf was a jerk, blah blah blah 

Well, my already-drunk-ass went with it.  Went back out to the kitchen table and I just remember him pouring me shot after shot, urging me to drink.  He‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúYeah, your bf was a complete dick!  Here‚Äôs a shot!‚Äù I was super sloppy already BEFORE this bottle. I don‚Äôt even remember how much I drank.  I don‚Äôt remember anything.  All I remember is at one point laying on my bed and kicking the wall.  I saw my heel imprint in it the next day.  I woke up with the worst hangover, much worse than my ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù  And I was naked.  I never accused him of anything because I just don‚Äôt know what happened. The night this happened it was only him and I in the apt.  My other two roomies were out of town camping and my bf wasn‚Äôt around because we had fought.

After that night, I basically stopped talking to Peter.  I didn‚Äôt cook anymore.  I stayed in my room until his sublet was over and Jack came back.  Peter had left two suitcases of stuff behind and was supposed to come back at some point to get it.  He found a new place to sublet.  

Then, there was a night where I was alone in the apt, and I kept getting calls from Peter.  I ignored them all.  But then Jack called me and said that Peter‚Äôs other sublet didn‚Äôt work out because the place was full of rampant weed smoking and binge-drinking and that it was too triggering for him to be there. (Really?!  *now* it‚Äôs triggering?!)

I find out he was actually *parked outside* my apt waiting for Jack  to talk me into letting him in to spend the night. 

I told Jack that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with Peter staying the night, but that he could come in briefly to get his suitcases. 

Jack was furious with me that I didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúsympathy‚Äù for him being in a triggering situation and that I was forcing Peter to have to sleep in his car in the middle of a new york winter.

Apparently he drove back to his southern state the next day and gave up on new york, and told Jack that he blames me for it.  

I told Jack about that night and he backed off on being angry with me.  

I just, I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶I have so many thoughts about this. 

Why was the other place triggering when he was perfectly okay to buy me a bottle I never asked for‚Äîand poured shots‚Äîand handed me the shots?  Why would he do that?  I could never do that to someone.  As I go through recovery, I could never purposely contribute to someone else getting absolutely shitfaced.  I was already drunk‚Äîwhy would he go out and get another bottle I never asked for?  

Here‚Äôs the thing, I have been drugged and raped, that happened in 2017, so it was after this whole thing.  But the 2017 experience is what really made me think more about this prior situation with Peter.  Like, did he go out and get a bottle, put some date rape drugs in it, and then feed me shots until I was out cold? 

I hate to admit it, but my tolerance at the time was pretty high.  So, even though I was drunk, an additional 4-5 shots wouldn‚Äôt have made me black out.  (I know, it‚Äôs nothing to be proud of, but it‚Äôs the truth.). 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking here‚Ä¶maybe just some thoughts from others who are recovering, why would he push me to drink?  What would you have done in my situation, waking up naked like that, not remembering how you got to bed, but remembering kicking the wall?",6,0

476,2021-08-27 20:05:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pczal3/my_pandemic_experience/,My pandemic experience,"I'm not sure how I would have classified my drinking before the pandemic (and I'm still not sure how I would classify it after the pandemic!). Before the pandemic I spent years as social drinker and while I always enjoyed alcohol and sometimes took it too far, the desire to drink consistently or most days and have alcohol available to me at any given time constantly was never part of my mind set or lifestyle.  But then in March 2020 the world changed and it was undoubtedly the point where my drinking took a serious turn. 

Back when all the dominos started to fall, I convinced myself to stock up on all of life necessities, including booze. I wasn't yet drinking most days of the week but I felt it would be a good thing to have on hand in case stores started closing or if booze somehow became the new toilet paper. So with my wife's blessing I went to town, literally! And I went big: 200+ cans of inexpensive beer, a case (12 bottles) of wine, half a dozen liquor bottles. I thought I might even have enough to last me the rest of 2020! (LOL, no)

It started out innocently enough. I was lucky enough to now be working from home after my office closed down. I didn't drink my stash in a week or even a month. But shit was starting to get scary *out there*, then again there was no reason it couldn't be fun *in here*. In a world that felt like it was taking a break from reality I felt like I could indulge myself, consequence free. When the world went back to normal I would do the same. I had nowhere to be at any given time, not even for work, and I always found ways to get out of early morning video calls or things I would rather not due hungover. Ah yes, the hangovers were frequent, but it's pretty easy, at least at first, to hide that from your coworkers, and you still are able to hide it from your family until after work is done for the day. Every single evening felt like a Friday or Saturday night, woo hoo!  

A few months pass by. The situation remains the same. The liquid stress relief continues to pour. One day I catch a reflection of myself in the mirror and I did a double-take: when did I develop those dark circles under my eyes? How did my face get so puffy? What happened to my eyes? Despite how exhausted I was starting to feel all the time, I had written it off as a byproduct of the pandemic. Besides, no one had even said anything to me about my appearance!

More months pass. I notice how my naturally athletic body had morphed into a genuine Dad Bod. Looking back at the time I also realize now that I was starting to develop health issues on top of merely physical ones. Not anything that warranted going to the doctor, but just a series of inconvenient stomach and digestive issues, on and off joint pain, allergy-like symptoms that I hadn't experienced as badly before. And constant frequent, seemingly incurable diarrhea, none of which I attributed to my drinking, but still enough for me to feel like I needed a break from the abuse I was throwing at my body through excessive drinking (and hangovers) and the poor diet that inevitably comes from this lifestyle.

Except I didn't take a break. COVID was still ravaging the country, the prospects of vaccines still seemed like a fever dream and there was a hotly contested election that was still being contested for some reason... long after the election. Throw in being locked in a house with young kids during a long winter and I became convinced that stress was the disease and alcohol the cure. 

Tried to do a dry January but that was over almost before it was started. I vowed to myself that I would normalize once things returned to normal for me. Except when things did (sort of) after the vaccines became available and the masks came off, I didn't. My mind started obsessively trying to calculate each day whether I had enough alcohol in the house to get me through the night. I would fixate on this while at work, often leaving work early or spending my lunch break going to the liquor store and trying to figure out how to discreetly get it back in to my house. I still knew better than to start buying liquor to get my fix (that's what alcoholics do I lied to myself) so I continued to stick with beer and wine, which I thought was ""safe"". Of course by this point I bought almost nothing but tall cans of craft or strong beer (always over 6% but the higher the better) and boxes of wine. Finally by the beginning of summer I was finding myself chugging beers and even wine in private before having to interact with other people, even other people who were drinking, because I didn't want anyone to see how much it took for me to seem like I was enjoying drinking. I knew that was a big red flag and it was almost like a siren was screeching its warning to me. Then I had a friend visit that I haven't seen in a while and in a combination of both pure joy and aided by my new habit, we went on a hard bender that ended with one of the worst hangovers I have ever had in my life.

All of this led me to this sub and my puffy eyes began to see the light. I'll save my sobriety story for another day but for now I am wondering, especially for those of you that stopped drinking in the past year or so, how was the pandemic for you?",8,10

Haven't had any crazy temptations or cravings, but my brain sometimes goes back to my ""old"" routine.  Like thinking about having a glass (or 4) of wine while I cook dinner, clean up, watch the news. It's not an issue of drinking when I feel down or bad or stressed, rather when I'm feeling great  - like now, Friday evening, it's hot outside, work is done.  

HOWEVER remembering this logic helps me:

So let's say I'm at a 95, without alcohol. Feeling pretty darn good.  So I have a glass of wine and now I'm feeling 100.  Cool! But quickly that starts to dip and now I'm at a 90, so I need another glass to get back up to 95, but then it dips to 85... so I need another glass to bring myself back up to a 90, and so on and at the end of it all, I'm actually at a 75 and wondering what was the point in all of that when I was feeling fine before the wine?

So I thought I'd make a post appreciating everything that's happened since I got sober, which most likely wouldn't have happened if I wasn't.

&#x200B;

In the past 292 days:

I married the love of my life, my crush since high school. Who stuck by me through some very dark times and never judge me, but was evidently heartbroken and fed up with my reckless self-deprecating behavior. The wedding was wonderful and we're happy as can be now. 

Bought a house. I would calculate how many hours I had to work to pay my rent and be able to buy enough booze to keep me drunk and numb. Since I wasn't drunk all the time I could work more hours and focus on side hustles to keep my mind from wandering. A few years ago I was a homeless addict, so this was huge.

That business I've been drunkenly talking about for years, I did it. Before I didn't have the motivation to shower more than once a week, let alone think about pursuing my dreams. It's not booming but it makes me happy and pays my bills.

I've seen my family more times since I've been sober than I have in the past 5 years before that combined. It's still weird and there's a lot of work to be done there, but it's nice.

I'm gonna be a dad. My wife's 8 weeks pregnant and not being passed out on the bathroom floor every night definitely helped with that. I can't even begin to express how grateful I am to be sober and I can't wait to be there for my kid at every sports game, art show, play or whatever they're into.

&#x200B;

There's a lot I've done and a lot I've changed about myself in the past 292 days and I haven't really stopped to think about all the amazing things that have happened. It's been hard and I'm constantly hanging on by a thread but I'm hanging on day by day counting the minutes.

Remembering my past brings me nothing but guilt and regret, but thinking about the future makes me hopeful. 292 days just trying to make it to 293.",88,0

My daughter is pushing my buttons and has succeeded in destroying my afternoon.  

I‚Äôm not really sure how we‚Äôre going to make it out of this.  But I know what I‚Äôm not going to do: drink.

The 10 year old girl, for lack of a better explanation, is on strike.  She‚Äôs refusing to do her homework‚Ä¶ among a multitude of other poor decisions.  

It‚Äôs Friday, and my birthday is tomorrow, and we have tentative plans to go stay at a cabin tomorrow.  This was/is contingent on her making some sort of dent into her mountain of homework.

Her mother is supporting our daughter‚Äôs terrible behavior , and , is the root cause of this predicament.  As she pulled our daughter out of school for three days.  And didn‚Äôt accomplish making sure our daughter  got caught up on her school work.

Assignment of blame does little to rectify this situation.  I accept responsibility for letting this situation unfold.  But what‚Äôs done is done, and my degree of powerlessness over this situation is all to clear at this point.


I will do my best to keep my cool, and do my best to not say mean things to my kid.  That‚Äôs about it because I can‚Äôt control her behavior and I can‚Äôt do her homework for her (And yes I‚Äôve tried to help her multiple times!).

And on top of all this, she‚Äôs been stealing my la croixs, and opening them and then not drinking them!!!  

So yeah, thanks for reading this!  The good news is that when something like this used to happen, my mind would reflexively default to alcohol, and that‚Äôs not happening.

Tonight, I will be getting my self under control, drinking la croix, and tea, and then stuffing my face with ice cream!

Being social at a bar used to be a lot easier. Well maybe I could drink socially again. I been thinking recently maybe my drinking wasn't all that bad. Just drinking socially, a few times a month to meet some people. But of course I couldn't drink with my current friends because they know I used to have a problem with it. If I think about it, I don't have that many friends here anymore, and if I break up with my boyfriend nothing is holding me here anymore really. So i might just move to a new city get a fresh start. Meet some people who don't know about my history with alcohol, where I could enjoy a few drinks without worrying about being seen by others.
I couldn't really lie to my mum though if I talked to her on the phone, and if she would come visit, she knows about my drinking she would be devastated if I drank again. Maybe getting a fresh start means cutting contact with family. Maybe it would be time not to talk to my mum anymore.

I've got a handle on it (or so I think), but the fact is that the latest discussion was prompted by my urge to drink while in a liquor store acquiring said N/A beer. An article was associating this risk factor with ""euphoric recall,"" of remembering the warmth and fun of the relevant substance but not its lows. Even in the liquor store I was quick to remember why I'm staying sober, but it no longer carries the urgency it did in the first few days, *so she's probably right*. I'm going to get some juices and soda this afternoon, see if I can substitute *it* further, leave the N/A beer for future occasions when the appearance of social drinking is necessary.

And if you ask me why, I'll probably lie and say I'm not sure why I don't like to talk about it, when I know exactly why I don't like to talk about it.

I'm ashamed of how much I like alcohol. I'm ashamed of what I've done drunk, and I'm ashamed that those hideous things didn't keep me sober. I'm ashamed that I'm years into trying to recover and still relapsing. I'm ashamed of the sneaky behaviour I adapted to abuse alcohol, hiding the usage, the amounts,  the hangovers. A lot of my self esteem hinges on identifying as a good person, because when I was a child, that was my only tangible aspiration in life. Can you be an alcoholic, dishonest, emotionally neurotic, sneaky, and stubborn, and still be a good person?

And when I have cravings, I'm ashamed. When I'm alone it occurs to me that I could relapse. And I don't want to talk about it because maybe you'll convince me not to relapse. In that moment, when I'm weighing it up, I don't want to be convinced either way. I know you don't have an alternative at hand to soothe me like alcohol does. In that moment, I feel it's a choice between unhappy or drunk. In reality, it's actually a choice between unhappy now, or extremely unhappy later. 

Anyone who claims sobriety should necessarily make you happier is talking shit. Sober people may be just as miserable as active alcoholics. However, they are substantially less likely to sabotage their relationships, their homes, and their jobs. They are more capable of coherently asking for help. But if you don't want to talk about it (I, personally, do not) they are more coherent to seek healthy coping mechanisms. It's easier to be hygienic, it's easier to remember your mistakes, it's easier to stay alive. It's not necessarily happier. But, in the long term, it's easier. 

Currently, I have no choice but to talk it through with my therapist. I have to talk about it if I want to get better. I should probably also keep posting here.

So we all went out to a pub. Everybody had already pregamed and that too in front of me. They offered I rejected. I had a red bull with them tho. After that they ordered pitchers and buckets and towers and shots and bombs. I stood tall. I ordered a milk shake, an espresso and even a mint ice tea. Nobody else was interested in food over drinks so I became the guy who ordered for everyone. I started chaperoning people who needed to go freshen up or to puke as they weren't able to handle themselves.

I felt so good. I still am, I am proud of myself. I really wanted to test myself and I did. This feeling is amazing. 

Lastly, one of my friends had waaaay too many jager bombs, and was completely blacked out, he was burning, had a severe headache, constantly puking, sweating and couldn't even walk 2 steps, he kept stumbling anf slurring, couldn't talk straight. I know he will have a killer hangover tomorrow and I feel bad for him.

BUT I FEEL GREAT FOR MYSELF, I know seeing him like this should not be a good thing, and I might be a bad person for this, but it made me glad I didn't drink and would be totally fresh tomorrow morning. Otherwise I'm pretty sure I would've been exactly in his situation. Waking up with the worst hangovers everyday. 

I loved that I didn't drink, although felt tempted at times, but my will power didn't give in. I will remember this night for a long time (because it was memorable, and the fact that I can remeber it - ie. Not being blackout drunk)

Have had only a few drinks this entire year and every time the situation has turned out worse than if I had never touched a drink.

On days where I do not drink I wake up clear headed and ready to plan the day, and take care of things on list of to dos.

On days where I do drink, I feel groggy and tired. I don't sleep well and I wake up still hung over from the previous night. Often times I will have done something the previous night to not benefit myself with how I look in the eyes of others. This will include doing things that make me slur or set a bad impression. Maybe I will say something that won't be the best. I have worked tirelessly to get to where I have in my life, and by having a drink and ruining a night I will often feel like I set myself back to start over again. Building back up.

I have been sober for close to two weeks now. A few weeks ago I had something to drink and didn't end up having a good night. In fact, it was a horrible night. I have been sober since and was sober for close to six months before that night, so feel confident in my ability to stay sober. It was a strong reminder for myself why I should pace myself or not drink at all.

For now, I don't think drinking is something that I will be able to have in my future. And with the way the nights have gone every time I have had a drink, I don't know if this is something I want to keep in my life at all. Quitting drinking long term looks to be the best approach, and something I know that I am easily capable of doing given I have gone stretches of time without drinking or thinking of having a drink at all.

I will be staying sober from here on out, good luck to anyone who reads this as well!",10,0

I hope you are well.

TL/DR: self indulgent post about where it started (a bad place), and how it's going (an OK place), but how I just need a few words of support / advice.

Sorry if this is a bit of an essay, I am looking for, I don't know? Someone to tell me to buck up, or that they have been there too, or that 3 months is something to be proud of, or just someone to tell me I can do this.

Or more honestly some advice as to how I keep doing this. I have read so many great stories (you guys are awesome) but also stories of people relapsing after years of sobriety, and I am scared of making obvious mistakes and relapsing. So, because action makes me feel like I have a semblance of control, I come here to ask you for advice / tips. I am sure the FAQ is full of them. But let's be even more honest here, I want to talk to someone that might understand. I want to know that my thoughts aren't just mine. That others wondered if they could stay true? And also, how you celebrate something when it's a secret to the world and/ or it's something everyone else is able to do easily? 

I've descended this far into self indulgence, so here's a bit of my back story. I have always drunk too much. From when I started when I was a teenager, I was always the friend that didn't know their limits, I was THE MOST fun for probably a couple of hours, then THE LEAST fun for the rest of the night. Through Uni and my 20s I gravitated to fellow big drinkers, and I figured I was just young, so I drank heavily. Black outs, bad decisions, so many many bad decisions. It niggled at me but not enough. 
In my 30s I started to change my life and become a ""grown up""; I moved closer to family, met my husband, had a baby, and I had a good, even great, career. 
Friends joked about my drinking, but overall it was accepted, we all drank! (Not when I was pregnant I want to add). But the truth is, I drank more than I needed to, I drank to escape me, to escape my anxiety, my inner demons, man I drank just to escape thinking about what I did the night before. 
I just want to add, before I go on, that my drinking existed before my marriage and it was always my decision to pick up a drink. If anything I say sounds like I blame my husband, I don't.
When I met my husband, I felt like I met my soulmate, he enjoyed a drink too, he was the lovable drunk one in his friend group. We had many, many nights based around drinking. And I married my drinking buddy. But my drinking got worse, exasperated by the wedding, I was a mess. I fell asleep once in the toilet at a wedding of one of his friends and woke up after everyone had gone home, I was a horrible, horrible drunk. And having to look after me triggered his anger. First, the rage, then the silent treatment, then name calling, and the odd threat of violence. All of this stupidly made me drink more, I drank to escape my feelings of shame and his anger. 

I tried to ""control my drinking"" many times, usually under the guise of a diet. Cut back. Learn moderation. Be a normal drinker. 

It never worked. 

Then Covid hit, the societal expectations in regard to sobriety got blurred (they didn't, I just could hide behind the stress of Covid to drink more). I started drinking in the morning, I blamed getting up every morning with my son as my excuse. Bollocks. I started drinking at my laptop at home, you can't smell the vodka on a video call. I swear it's a miracle I kept my job. 
And the silence got worse, what was 3 days once every couple of months, became almost every week. And the aggressive silence for 72 hours constantly every week did nothing to stop me. Nor did the name calling. He didn't know how to stop me, so he thought punishment would help. I don't blame him, who knows how to cope with an alcoholic they can't escape?! 

I woke up every night at 4am knowing I had to stop, wondering if death would end the cycle, but unwilling to do that to my child. And tbh too scared, still a glimmer of hope that I could control the drink. That I could find a way to still drink, but not to the point of oblivion. Because there was no way a life without alcohol was worth living. Even a life where my hands shook, my voice slurred, my mind drudged through the sludge of existence. 

I tell you this, dear reader, because it was bad. Even if I still can't say the word there is no denying what I was, what I am. 

Then one day, 3 months ago, something clicked. A friend calmly said I was an alcoholic, they they didn't say it with anger but with understanding. They didn't do anything. But almost by them lifting the veil, that I wasn't as good as hiding it as I thought, it was the trigger to make me stop. 

And I drank the day that they told me, with my husband. 

And then I stopped. I changed my thinking. I stopped trying to control the drinking. I accepted that I had had my last drink. That the only control I have is over the first drink, to have it or not, once I choose to have it then the drink is in control. I started reading people's stories on here, I even posted once on my main account, but I need this account to be raw. I needed to be honest, even if no one reads this. I needed to write it.

So here we are, 94 sober days behind me, I ate a lot of sweets at first! I think about the idea of alcohol, but I can't remember what I missed exactly. I am sad when I think of the idea of a holiday with a glass of wine in the sun. But, so far, it's been ok. It's been OK. I've even been to the pub a couple of times with a friend and not drank. But I am so so so frigging scared of getting complacent and because it's been OK then I will relapse. I don't believe I will ever be able to get back on the wagon if I fall off. So I ask you, kind reader, what tripped you up? How can I avoid them? How do I stay strong? For me and for my son. 

Also, because it's been OK, is it still OK to feel really really proud of getting this far? Because some days I think it is, and other days I am like, yeah but... I just don't drink anymore. I didn't run a marathon or save a life, I just didn't pick up a glass of wine for 94 days! 

Anyway, this has helped. I don't want a drink. So thank you Internet void. I have poured out my heart instead of a glass of wine! And I feel a bit better. 

Stay strong folk - I think you are all amazing, wherever you are on your journey! IWNDWYT",9,2

It hurts to admit parental stress is a trigger for me. Today the kid across the street knocked my 6.5 year olds tooth out while I was on a conference call. This is after weeks of door knocks, doorbell rings, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hot outsides‚Äù, and my kids giving away expensive bottled beverages. You know, to find them half drank and left in the lawn while they run between properties incessantly asking to go in or out or do something with themselves. 

I talk myself off the rage ledge every time through gritted teeth and go through the expected boundaries. No indoor play, if you‚Äôre hot come in, don‚Äôt give your friends drinks, clean up after your guests. Punishments and everything else and of course they‚Äôre 6.5 and 9 and improve but only so much. The annoyance continues. 

Yeah I know I chose to have kids so fuck off people who think of that clever response. Everyone has rose colored glasses about parenting and having kids. I never really considered the 24/7 indentured slavery feel.

I was diagnosed with PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), and was prescribed three HEAVY doses of meds that I would take twice a day for two weeks. 

These meds would cause me to projectile vomit/shit myself if I had the slightest bit of alcohol. I couldn't even have cold medicine. So I gave myself a night to have my last beers, and quit cold turkey the following day. 

It wasn't *terrible* the first couple of days, but on days 3 and 4, I struggled SO. HARD. I couldn't stop thinking about it, I had to repetitively talk myself down from drinking, and then it devolved into self pity, overwhelming suicidal thoughts, self hate, and hopelessness. That day I downloaded a couple sober apps that have helped a little, but now that I'm on my first day off the antibiotics, I'm struggling to stop myself from opening a beer. 

I want a healthy relationship with alcohol. Whether that means becoming sober or limiting the intake, I have no idea. I have a feeling it's going to have to be sobriety, but I'm trying to take my time with my journey. 

In the moments where I'm thinking about drinking, I struggle to see the reasons why I want to stop. There's this weird part of my brain that keeps trying to convince me to drink because it's totally fine, I love it, I can moderate it, etc. Obviously I don't trust it, it's just sometimes that part of my brain is so loud, I can't hear or think about anything else. 

I guess I just don't really know how to continue this journey if it's not medically prescribed/forced. Any encouragement/help/advice would be so amazing.

***

There are two days in every week about which we should not worry, two days which should be kept free from fear and apprehension. 

One of these days is Yesterday with all its mistakes and cares,
its faults and blunders, its aches and pains. 

Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control.
All the money in the world cannot bring back Yesterday. 

We cannot undo a single act we performed;
we cannot erase a single word we said.
Yesterday is gone forever. 

The other day we should not worry about is Tomorrow
with all its possible adversities, its burdens,
its large promise and its poor performance;
Tomorrow is also beyond our immediate control. 

Tomorrow's sun will rise, 
either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds, but it will rise.
Until it does, we have no stake in Tomorrow,
for it is yet to be born. 

This leaves only one day, Today.
Any person can fight the battle of just one day.
It is when you and I add the burdens of those two awful eternities Yesterday and Tomorrow that we break down. 

It is not the experience of Today that drives a person mad,
it is the remorse or bitterness of something which happened Yesterday and the dread of what Tomorrow may bring. 

Let us, therefore, Live but one day at a time.

I'm in my late twenties, but still like to envision myself as a formerly-fit kid who's just let himself go. While I may not be obese, by any measure, I cringe whenever I pass by a mirror topless, seeing love-handles and the sort of nascent man-breasts that'd make a sixth-grade girl jealous. 

I wrestled, fenced, and hiked when I was younger. Then, in university, I got a part-time job working in the office of a Russian friend. 

My boss had a bit of an alcohol problem, too--we'd often get drunk in the office, ordering two large pizzas to share between us, day after day, week after week. 

This went on for months--and I really packed on the pounds. I went from being a skeletal stick-man to getting comments on my Facebook saying, *Looks like you've been eating a lot of pizza in the office, bro, haha.* 

For a very long time, a small part of me blamed the office: how else could I have gotten so big so fast? I shouldn't have kept eating all the free food. 

Now, in hindsight, I realize those years--between 2014 and 2015--were the years I first fell into drink. I'd recently turned 21, only to the lose the one friend I'd had throughout childhood to a heroin addiction I didn't even know he had. I got drunk almost every day, after class, after work, when I should have been studying for exams or using the gym membership I'd bought. 

I packed on the pounds, drunk-driving my motorcycle to McDonald's instead of cooking healthy. 

I let alcohol carry me away, to places I'd never imagined and never had much desire to see. And here I am, in 2021, scarcely two week sober and just making sense of something that should've never been much of a mystery. 

Now, in hindsight, it's no wonder how I put on such noticeable weight in the course of a summer--and, I suppose, no small miracle that my stupid, drunk-motorcycle-driving self never woke up in the I.C.U., or worse. 

I might be surrounded by a table's worth of cheesecake, chips, and pizza--but there's no alcohol to be seen, and none closer than, perhaps, my next-door neighbor's apartment. I've been trying to eat healthier, and have--with the exception of last night's slip-up--largely succeeded. I've lost 10 pounds in the past month, and have plans to go back to the gym and rejoin martial arts once I'm back home in America. 

I feel good, even if I've yet to feel normal. 

So I'd like to apologize to the Russians I've spent years kind-of, sort-of blaming for the body I still think I only recently lost, just to realize it's been some six years since I was happy with my own reflection.

Not drinking hasn't been easy. But I've fewer cravings each day. I can picture my life without alcohol, in a way that isn't quite comfortable but seems a much better alternative than the life led with it.

Waking up disoriented without having changed out of my clothes and makeup and without having used my CPAP or having taken my nightly meds just...  Ugh.  It was a valuable reminder of why I can't drink and that I cannot moderate my drinking.

I'd love to have someone to chat with who understands the struggle.  I would love some suggestions of what to drink instead of alcohol or things to do wen I really start craving it.

Question:  I don't get triggered when I see the massive alcohol selection at my local stores, it's usuall when I watch something that involves alcohol.  DAE get triggered in a similar way?

Just want to call out how amazing this community is. I'm a daily reader and upvoter (when appropriate) and occasional commenter. This is my first time posting here. Long story short: I'm in a tough spot and don't know what to do. I'm not here for sympathy - just empathy, camaraderie and helpful advice. TL;DR at the bottom.

*Alcohol context*‚Ä¶ I am 36 days sober from alcohol. I've got new found energy and have lost 6 pounds. Have had some mental clarity. And that is worth celebrating! Hell yes! Worth noting that I have been a daily bourbon drinker for the better part of 2 years (with a history of frequent binge drinking off and on for many, many years before that). And when I say daily, I mean 3-to-4 heavy pours per day. Working with a psychiatrist who prescribed acamprosate and is helping with anxiety/depression with prozac. And yes - I'm also in talk therapy. 

*Life context*‚Ä¶ My life has been a depressing shit show for a while now. My wife has lost 2 sisters in 3 years - they were my family, too, and I miss them. The 2nd of which passed away 2 months after we started chemotherapy for my 15 year old daughter who has a brain tumor (and she will be in chemo until at least next March). Yeah‚Ä¶ and all of this is during a fuggin global pandemic. Oh, and did I mention that my half-sister died 2 weeks ago in a car crash? WTF! 

*Fast forward to last week*‚Ä¶ my 10 year old son had been back to physical school for the first time in over 1.5 years for only 5 days - and he caught COVID. And gave it to my wife. Despite her being vaccinated, she has been down for the count for over a week and is only just now getting better. In the stress of keeping the 2 of them healthy, keeping my immunocompromised daughter isolated and safe (also vaccinated btw), I have only BARELY been hanging on. Didn't catch COVID, but in my desperation I discovered a new brand of hemp THC products. Gummies, vapes, etc. 

*Now we arrive at the present*‚Ä¶ I have gotten high AF every day this week. I actually took a sick day yesterday simply so I could get high and stay high all day. And I did. And I managed to hide it from everyone (well, once the kids were in bed my wife knew I vaped and didn't care‚Ä¶ but she had no idea I was blitzed all damn day). Not going to lie - the absolute oblivion and escape of getting high has been magical. Until it isn't. During a 3 hour period where I was in bed mentally drifting (and maybe sometimes sleeping?) I kept thinking to myself, ""what the fuck are you doing? You've come so far this past month. All you are doing is trading one addiction for another!"" 

**Has anyone else been in a positive place with quitting alcohol only to find themselves picking up another bad habit? Has anyone quit alcohol and been able to have a HEALTHY relationship with weed/THC? Any advice is appreciated.**

Thank you for reading this far. I appreciate each and every one of you and the unique struggles you are experiencing. Much love from me to all of you. Today, like the last 36 IWNDWYT.

Not to the point where I'm drinking every day, or even every week.  For me, it was binging at parties, events, or occasionally on a Wednesday night after a couple long weeks.  I found myself drinking my first 2 beers within a matter of a minute.  Then I'd drink a 12 pack like it was nothing.  I'd get in to arguments, confrontations, and have to make up and apologize in the next few days after the party/event.  I finally reached my breaking point at a airbnb football draft.  Fell over and broke a table, and my name wasn't on the airbnb agreement.  So my friend took the hit (I paid for the table) - but that was the last straw.  I was embarrassed, I was remorseful, and full of regret.  Not to mention I made a complete ass of myself.  This was about a month ago, and since then I've had a single scotch on a date night with my wife.  I new goal I have for myself is to enjoy a drink every now and again, but no more getting drunk.  It's perfectly acceptable to enjoy a beer or a spirit, as long as I remain in control and that my end-all goal - to maintain control without binging.

EDIT: I should also add I have terrible anxiety, so my Dr put me on Lexapro.  The Lexapro and the alcohol make me even more emotional (angry/confrontational) when I binge(d).",2,0

I did a quiz then spoke to a chatbot that referred me to a phone line which referred me to a local service to deal with addiction. I have an appointment booked with them for mid-September. Weird thing is I don't know what to do til then. They told me it would be dangerous for me to quit straight away and instead to keep a drink diary but now I know I have this appointment coming up I feel like I want to quit cold turkey or something (I realise I probably only feel this cos it's mid afternoon and will feel differently come evening when the hangovers gone). 

For context I'm 27f and have drunk heavily daily for four or so years now - 4-8 cans a night or 1-2 bottles of wine. It got worse recently due to messed up family stuff. Like many others in this sub I'm high functioning, hold down a job etc and my friends see my heavy drinking as a ""quirk"". I feel weirdly dramatic and self-conscious announcing I  an alcoholic and will never drink again or whatever and also a party pooper. We have a leaving do for someone tomorrow night too. I'm in the UK so drinking is very much a part of our culture. 

I'm confused because the advisor said to keep drinking til our appointment but then it would feel weird to tell my friends while I am still drinking. Was anyone else in a similar situation and has advice for these early stages?

I just have one question which I couldn't quite find the answer to here, not to any satisfactory degree.
 
The question is, do I necessarily need actual help from others to quit?
 
I moved countries to join the army at age 18. I have always been alone even though I do have a loving family, I am so disgusted by myself and its hard for me to keep up appearances with them so it's actually really difficult when i visit them and I usually drink every day and feel ashamed anyway.
 
I cannot take support. I don't even feel comfortable getting help from my friends. I really always believed that I could accomplish anything alone. I have a good job which I'm not taking seriously enough, good friends that I'm slowly losing, and good health which... Well its only a matter of time.
 
If one person tells me it's possible to climb this mountain alone and stay there then maybe I can develop the hope to do it. Has anyone succeeded without interventions and rehabs and programs and support groups? I cannot stomach the thought of it and feel so unwelcome and ashamed of myself in every situation. I feel like asking for sympathy makes me seem fake and pathetic. I don't know why.
 
I don't want to be alone forever, I want to eventually feel happy about myself. But I would rather be able to conquer myself without help.
  
And yes I do realize the irony of being here on reddit, asking for help. 
 
Good luck to you all out there today and much respect to those staying strong and supporting others.",12,0

551,2021-08-27 07:51:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pclscn/what_does_the_fear_mean_to_you/,What does 'the fear' mean to you?,"I remember in the book/movie Fear and Loathing in the Las Vegas they alluded to ""I think I'm getting the fear."" I've also seen others on reddit mention it as well. Does this term simply mean a sudden wave of anxiety? Or is there some over meaning?

Regardless, here I sit on day 7 and while I've been a bit better I am still disgusted my own behavior a week ago and the awful things I said. I do find some peace in that quitting drinking has probably saved my life and will prevent further manic episodes. It's not my fault I'm bipolar. It's not my fault I survived CSA and act out very inappropriately when manic, but it IS my fault for continuing to imbibe something that I have a checkered history with. I said those things, so I can really excuse my own behavior? At least, I'll lose that pesky 30 lbs or whatever (I rarely weigh myself) and work towards a better light. However, here I am facing some of the same issues that cause me drink in the first place: I'm chronically alone, not a lot of friends left. I took a long weekend but then it's like what I am going to do exactly? It's just so empty in the house. Yesterday, once my work day ended I started to feel anxious, though I think I might've forgotten to take my meds in the AM as I was getting the brain zaps all of sudden. That's not normal unless I miss a dose. I'm trying to be good to myself though. I felt like death for a number of days, then, I got a text from someone I thought I had offended months before in response to my apology. She was never mad at me apparently, evidently just taken aback by my overly blunt comments expressing my attraction to her, lol. She forgave me nonetheless and it's nice to know I do have friends even if it doesn't feel like it sometime. There's also a bit of a fight or flight within me for sure. Even before this recent event I felt I was stagnating. I like my town and love my house, but most people I know have needed a change of scenery. It made me wonder if maybe moving somewhere where there are MORE single people might be a good option. Or am I simply running away from my problems and I'll be running for the rest of my life?!?

Anyways, this sub has helped me tremendously I can't even describe. I consider it a big part of my recovery and support system. I do need local meetings too but I like the wider audience here. I love you all!

EDIT: I meant literally when people use the expression ""the fear"" what does it mean? Like, an incoming anxiety/panic attack. I've seen it here in SD. ""I started to get the fear.""  Not the fear of heights or spiders. Just 'the fear.' I like the thoughts in your post though I just wanted to make sure I explained my question accurately.

It has been a troubling time for me for the last 2 months or so. From moving back to an old environment which has had its fair share of demons that have reared their heads. Bringing my own demons a 4 month binge that progressively got worse and worse. My ex wife's family getting covid and a few passing away due to it. Being 9000 miles away from my daughter that I haven't seen physically since 2017 and the tragic loss of my son in 2010. To a home where I first started my alcohol adventure of destruction and with my nana succumbing to dementia, the slow tearing apart of my family and losing a girl whom I really care about we are in the early stages of let's be friends.

Doom and nothing but gloom has been my mind set for 41 days and I'll say it was the latter part of the opening that 'broke the camels back'. However there is a silver lining of all of it in that I have not been drunk or even had any desire to drink for 41 days. It is an accomplishment regardless how many days you are in. Especially during the difficult times or even at the best of times, if we hold on to the notion that alcohol is not our cure or our escape but rather and in the words of Commander Ackbar, ""ITS A TRAP"" we can get through our days with just one less thing to worry about. 

It would be far to easy to pick up the bottle!

I'm going to start being kind to myself and just for today I will not drink with you.",12,1

This last week I went to a wedding and completely embarrassed myself and my wife in front of all her family. This wasn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve done something like this. In fact it‚Äôs the only thing we ever really fight about since we‚Äôve been together. I start off thinking I can have a few drinks and be social and by the next morning, people are telling me what I did/said and I have no recollection. I seem to always convince myself and others that I don‚Äôt have a problem because I don‚Äôt have any dependency issues. I don‚Äôt drink during the week and keep physically active. Sometimes I do only have a couple and make it out ‚Äúsober‚Äù. But by most Friday‚Äôs at 1am I‚Äôm completely black out drunk just screwing around in my garage or playing video games. When I drink alone, no one seems to care, because I play off hangovers and handle responsibilities. I‚Äôm dragging ass on Monday, but everything gets done. If I‚Äôm out socially though there‚Äôs a good chance I will wind up embarrassing myself. 

My immediate reaction is to just call it off and quit. I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about embarrassing social situations or fighting with my wife about being drunk ever again. 

My second thought is that that would be damn near impossible. So many work events I go to include drinking. Every social event I go to with friends revolves around drinking. I‚Äôm supposed to go on a guys party trip next month and I have no idea how I could go about telling all them I quit or even just not having one drink on the entire trip. 

I want to be a social drinker and have a few beers, but I‚Äôm seriously doubting my ability to do that. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some words of encouragement or advice on how to handle all the alcohol type events going forward or how to make this make sense in my brain. I am finally admitting to myself though, that something needs to change.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning / evening, SD! 

&#x200B;

It's Friday morning over here and I'm looking forward to peaceful weekend. In the first few weeks / months of sobriety, I dreaded weekends! The weekdays offered enough structure and work responsibilities to stay on the sober path, but weekends felt like a wilderness of temptation, and frankly I was angry and resentful. I felt like I was being punished and deprived of my right to have fun, I was irritated by other people enjoying their glasses of wine in restaurants, and I saw no point in doing any activity that didn't involve alcohol. 

&#x200B;

I'm thankful that my views on life and fun have changed over time! I slowly woke up to how good it can feel to live free of poison and. But in those early days, I needed a lot of help and ideas from r/stopdrinking. I'll share some of the ideas I've picked up and invite you to share as well!  

* Take a long hike away from my usual surroundings
* A hot bath
* Stay in bed with a book (I finally started reading Tana French -- can't put her down!)
* Phone a friend
* Read quit lit / listen to a sober podcast
* Do a guided meditation (I like Tara Brach on youtube)
* Go to an in-person or zoom meeting
* Go to the zoo or aquarium 
* Work out (preferably out of the house)
* Put on loud music and dance around my living room
* Stock my fridge with lots of fizzy water and tasty non-alcoholic beverages
* Check in here or pop into the live chat (see sidebar for #stopdrinking IRC chat)
* Write in my journal 

Wishing everyone a beautiful Friday and thanks for sticking with me as my week of hosting the DCI winds down. I can't express how rewarding it has been for me to come here each morning. If you have 30 days or more sober and would like to host the DCI, give u/SaintHomer a shout!

Happy and sober.,"I've been flying along the ""I'm gonna quit"" plan for awhile, but I never truly committed to it in my soul. Now I'm ready.

Last Thursday, my hearing started to go, I couldn't see and my arm had the most wild convulsion. I had been three days into a dry period when the most severe and scary withdrawals of my life hit - and I still wanted to hide it. 

Then I snapped out of it. I told my family. I begged to be taken to the ER. The doctors saw me coming, pulling me to a bed even though several with COVID were waiting in the lobby. I was in bad shape. I wouldn't even make it through the week without ""escaping"" the first hospital. Luckily, they got ahold of my family and my brother was able to find me. The DT's had convinced me I was three states away on a reality game show. I have no idea where that idea came from. I was finally taken to the county hospital where the staff took care of me and got me over the hump.

I never want to drink again. This stuff is too powerful. I am nothing compared to the power of the universe it took to keep me alive this past week. People saved me. God saved me. The drink just wanted to kill me.

Now I'm home, happy and sober. I know this feeling will wear off as I start to perhaps think about some of my regrets. Where do I go from here? I'm ready to listen. I'm ready to learn. I'm ready to cast aside my ego and cast aside the monster inside me that craves the first drink.

The first 20'ish days I was in a bit of a funk. Feeling sorry for myself, depressed, full of anxiety, dealing with frequent headaches and generally foggy and frustrated. My relationship with my wife and son, not great. Around day 23 or so, I started to come out of my funk. I was walking nightly, drinking a ton of water, and realized what it felt like to wake up normal every morning. I was also rapidly losing weight I didn't have to lose and still had no appetite. I used to only eat once a day, and it wasn't uncommon to not eat at all. Still my energy was coming on strong. I was starting to feel like a person again. Somewhere around day 55 I confronted my wife about our relationship, i knew she wasn't happy. We actually talked about things for the first time in what seems like forever.

Kinds of drugs that I approve of from the Earth, and kinds that I dont approve of that are manmade.  Haven't done that in years, despite many bouts of heavy drinking, along with many attempts to quit.  Woke up the next day with cuts on my foot/ankle, a bowl of food in the oven that was still on, wondering if I pissed off any of my neighbors that I sometime would drink with, or pissed off the community I live in, and feeling drained of any dopamine, yet unable to sleep it off since mushrooms, acid, and amphetamines don't really let you sleep.  Vowing again to quit, I've made it 6 days and feel much better.  

&#x200B;

Although the cuts turned into blisters the next day, I popped them, only for monday to come around and me feel tired, hurt, and sick, when I thought I had made it through the worst.  Tuesday night the cuts are worse, my lymph nodes were swollen, my foot is swollen, pain all over, sleeping on monday when I already slept all weekend.  I've already dealt with so much heavy drinking that after sleeping it off for a day and a half, that I cant really sleep much for the next few days.  One, cause I already slept so much, and two, cause I dont sleep well for a few days after binge drinking for a few days.  I knew something was wrong, and I hit all the symptoms for necrotizing fasciitis, which is a fast moving (sometimes kills in 12-24 hours) bacteria, so I went to the ER and was diagnosed with cellulitis, which is also life threatening but just takes a little longer.  

&#x200B;

Anyways, I've made it this far.  Already options are opening up for going back to school, job offers, and who knows what else.  This happens everytime a I quit for a few days.  Things just get better.  Yet, I have thrown it away 234890234 times.  I dont like AA.  But I do need to do something different this time.  Possibly actual psychedelic therapy?  Posting here more?  Actually making it though the books I bought?  (This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained).  I'm not sure yet.  I dont know that this post will help anyone, but I guess it's my attempt to at least do something trying to hold myself accountable.  I have a good job coming up and don't want to spoil it from binge drinking, let alone just be stupid and hurt my life period.

So I told him that I would both love to and could afford to pay for half of it and he could think of it as an anniversary gift. His response was that he might just buy it himself and consider it a gift from me, for me. An idea that I was fully in support of.

And it made me laugh, because just by changing the way he saw it, it changed what he decided to do.

And I use that kind of mental trickery, that change of perspective, everyday in many ways, especially in my recovery journey. 

I will have a thought such as ""I really want the oblivion of drinking right now"". I may even think of all the so-called good things it would provide. And looking at it from that perspective makes me want to do it all the more. 

However when I stop and think about it more, I see all the negative things it gives me. And looking at it from that perspective, allows me to change my mind and say ""You know what? I actually don't want to drink at all"". 

The actual urge to drink did not change but my perspective on it changed everything. Pretty cool.",13,0

Everyone‚Äôs journey is different. I didn‚Äôt drink on weekdays or by myself, I was a social drinker. So for me, it was a concert I went to recently, as I‚Äôd usually have a few drinks before to put myself in a good mood and have a few drinks whilst there to feel confident. It was like I‚Äôd trained my brain use alcohol as a short-cut to feeling happy and confident, so stopping has been a blessing, because it forced me to look elsewhere for those things‚Ä¶  


**My Biggest Win**

I have a renewed love for fitness, nature and creative hobbies like playing the guitar - I just had to clean the dust out of it first! I used to pick gaming over keeping fit or being creative, because it took less effort, not because I genuinely preferred it. It is fun, so I still game on the odd occasion, but I feel more motivated since I stopped drinking, so took the time to cultivate new hobbies and feel happier for it. As for confidence, there have been challenges, but the more I put myself outside of my comfort zone, the more I started to feel as confident sober, as I would have felt previously after drinking.  


I used to think it would be impossible to give up alcohol and now I don‚Äôt miss it at all. So if anyone reading this wants to stop drinking or make any positive life changes, the next time you‚Äôre about to tell yourself ‚ÄòI should be doing better‚Äô or ‚ÄòI suck at his‚Äô, consider using positive self talk instead, like ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing the best I can‚Äô or ‚ÄòI can do this‚Äô.",94,0

I am just super proud of myself. Two years ago today, I was at my parents, 130 miles away, and getting packed to go to rehab the next day. I was so conflicted, scared and unhappy. Terrified really. 

After 30 years of drinking, my life had fallen apart finally. I lost my job, of 15 years, 6 months before, my paid for car a year before and I was about to lose my apartment. 

But I had my ""moment"". I finally confronted that I could not continue the way I was. Some one would die. And so I told on myself, to my family, to my mate. Reached out for help. And my best friend, both sets of parents and my mate reached back. 

My parents were shocked mostly, I had hidden it well, but not surprised, so not that well I guess lol. More about how extensive the problem was more than the fact that I had one. My bestie knew and was just super proud that I was doing something about it. 

But my mate's response was one I will never, ever forget. Because he is in recovery himself. And he knew that I would hear nothing about it until I was ready. So he never pushed, just quietly supported me. I never knew how much it cost him to see me that way until much later. Nor how close I came to losing him because of it. 

My moment was coming to in a sketchy sitch and no memories. I called him and after I told him where I was and what happened, I told him I couldn't do this anymore, that I needed help. He said ""First of all, I am so glad you are okay. I had faith that you would get to this point and I am so glad you are here."" I admitted that I didn't know what to do. And, very gently, he said ""I think you need to go to rehab."" 

The mere thought of that terrified me utterly. 

""How...?"" 
""I will help you baby.""

And so he did. And after some work, I found the rehab I wanted and called. They said that they had no beds but they could put me on a waiting list. I would, however, need to call daily for a ""bed check"" to stay on the list. So I did. After a month, I had to give up my apartment and my mom and stepdad came, helped me pack, paid for a storage unit for my stuff, helped me clean the apartment and took me home with them, 130 miles away.

After another month of calling, I finally got a bed and was told to report in a few days, Aug 27th 2019. I thought ""But... That's the day after our anniversary! I am not going to be able to see him!"" And I was crushed. 

I reported to my inpatient rehab, where you are put on a 6 week communication lock down. Nothing but letters allowed. It was the first time we hadn't spoken for longer than 24 hours. It was so damned hard. I missed him terribly, but it was necessary. I reminded myself that it (rehab and everything thing related to it) was worth it because I was working on becoming the person he always saw in me, the one I lost sight of years ago.

I finished rehab and moved back to my parents so that I could learn to live sober and start putting a new life, a sober life, together for myself. 

It's taken a while. And it is still a work in progress. But I have reached the point that I can now move back to my area, get a place and a job. Little disheartened after starting to look, but that is okay, I will keep pushing.

Over the last 2 years, I have only gotten to see my mate a handful of times. And that has been rough. This was not supposed to be a LDR.

But it is only a chapter in our book. And I can do anything for a little while.

So the fact that my sobriety date is the day after our anniversary is now a great joy to me.

It's all a matter of perspective.

Have a great day my friends.

Eta: I was always pretty good at not *seeming* drunk, even in blackouts apparently. I usually didn't slur or stagger or get sloppy. After a while he could figure out from just my phrasing that I was impaired. And it still upsets me that my mate has cherished memories from the first 2 years that I don't. And it is always so shameful to me when I have to admit that I don't remember what he is reminiscing so fondly about. But we both deal with it, because we know that I will never forget things like that again because I was drunk.",12,0

Im living in a place where it's been happening so serverely that the gov has put the whole city in a lockdown with extreme measures. I mean, I am not allowed to go out to even buy the stuff myself. And due to this very hard situation the shops can't deliver me beers which I forgot (or did not bother) to stock before.  

Me? More than 10 years of continuous drinking every single day. 

Now? 5 days without drinking.

The amazing thing I want you to know? I FORGOT THAT IM A DRUNK FROM THE FIRST DAY. That's it. From the first day, the thought of ""shit, I forgot my beer, anyway cant buy it now, impossible"" put me in the mental state that I didnt need to think about the beers because they could not be reached. And with it, I went to bed the first day without even reminding myself that I need the beers.

And guess what happened? I slept very well since the 1st day. And up to the 4th day did I realize for the first time that I'm a drunk I need the beers, but then ""nah, can't get them anyway"" again stops me from thinking. This is from a decade long alcoholic man. 

I realized that I actually can sleep very easily without drinking, not even the reducing method that everyone uses. And I can actually spend the 24hours a day not thinking about the next serve. At all. Mind blown.

So guys, the deep reason relies on the fact that you and I, normally we can reach the alcohol too easily. So we trick our own brain into thinking that we need them to be stable, to forget, to sleep, to act normal. It's not true. You tried to not drinking, but it does not work because deep inside you know it's still there and you can buy or get it anytime you want, it's what ignites your thirst to drink, not because it will solve anything.",54,2

He was a huge man who had the biggest heart I have ever seen. I try to be like him every day. 

Last night I got a phone call from her asking if I could look at her computer this week when I brought the kids over. So I was off today brought the kids over. I also brought my tool box because I know she will never ask me but there‚Äôs always little tasks to be done. 

I cleaned out the dust under her fridge fixed her laptop fixed a ceiling fan and mowed her grass so my dad wouldn‚Äôt have to.

We sat in her living room and talked for an hour and I had known her mom and dad were alcoholics and she really opened up about it today when she asked how I was doing.

I stopped drinking about a week and a half ago and I have had some very intense mood swings. I usually chalk them up to hormones, but these are happening much more frequently than just the designated day or two - a few days here, then I'm good, then a few days later I'm melting down again. 

I should also preface this with the fact that I'm starting classes again (in person) and I took a new job that also meets in person. I woke up today with a sore throat and massive anxiety, likely due to these incredible changes. (FWIW I just took a Covid test, just to be safe.) 

In the past, I would go out to eat, have a few drinks and relax with my partner & everything would be fine. This option no longer exists for me because I am too afraid to be in a setting where I am so used to drinking and I'm not ready to put myself in that position yet. 

Instead, I have been throwing myself into my studies and my job, meal prepping and filling my schedule until it bursts at the seams. I am so exhausted by the end of the day (or by mid-morning, honestly) that all I want to do is be alone to relax, but because my SO is still working from home, there's nowhere for me to go to be truly alone. We have a very small apartment and I feel incredibly guilty for asking him to stay in one room while I work on things OR when I close myself off in a room - I feel guilty for not paying attention to him. (This is all due to childhood co-dependency issues that I am ALSO working through - life, amirite?) 

I guess I am just wondering... does it get better? I stopped drinking because I knew that I was using it as a way to not deal with my issues. I didn't realize HOW much I depended on it to get me through, though. It was always there, at the end of the day, and if I could make it to the end of the day I would reward myself... now, it's just me, myself and I, trying to power through.

My original goal was to abstain from alcohol for 30 days.

Today marks 123 days without alcohol, the longest I have gone in 14 years (since I turned legal drinking age and could buy alcohol for myself.)

It feels extremely stupid and self-pandering to say, but I'm proud of that number and myself for reaching it.

I've struggled with alcohol abuse for many years. It was a compulsion to drink; the real reason being self-loathing and boredom.

Things aren't magically better today than they were before, but they are marginally better and more importantly I have a different paradigm regarding alcohol:

I dont ""feel"" like having a drink again.

I'm very familiar with the rush, the stupor and the aftermath that accompanies drinking. Honestly, I'll pass. I realize I was using alcohol as a way to kill myself painfully, and I dont want to do that anymore.

I look at alcohol now as an expensive poison, and while I'm certainly not against others drinking and enjoying it. I genuinely dont want to partake and start walking that path again.

I view a life without alcohol as a different chapter/act in my life. It's not a loss or a viewpoint of ""having to go without"" but instead ""let's see what I'm capable of at my peak"". If that makes sense.

I guess I just wanted to share with someone, anyone. I've never told another human being about my alcohol problems before this post.

I told my grandmother this morning and she congratulated me -- then said I should buy a bottle of wine to celebrate now that I'm over it.

I dont think I'm over it. I think I'm a recovering alcoholic who is beginning to find meaning and I dont want to throw that away for an overly romanticized cultural  gesture.

So, I'm not going to tell anyone else. I'll just shout it to the void online.

My wife and her family don‚Äôt see a problem with their fathers behavior, ever! They are constantly making excuses for him being a dick.  So I generally feel rather alone in all this. 

This brings us to the present, father in law comes to visit all happy that he has a grand child, just acting like he doesn‚Äôt have a care in the world and he‚Äôs the best grandfather in the universe and has so much love in his heart, fucking whatever.  He has been around since Monday, thankfully he is staying somewhere else.  But he never calls before he comes over and you know, sometimes my wife or I have something going on, cause you know, unbeknownst to him we have lives that don‚Äôt always involve him.  I have some work meetings that I have to attend virtually this week and my wife said to just carry on and do what I need to do as if her father wasn‚Äôt there, üëåI can do that.  He comes over sure as shit, right when I have a really important meeting, I‚Äôm trying to eat and put the baby down before hopping on so I‚Äôm a little flustered.  I run into my office, put headphones on and do my meeting. When I come out a couple hours later my father in law gives me a ‚Äúlook‚Äù and leaves.  My wife tells me that I was rude to him and I am like totally shocked that somehow in all of this I‚Äôm the one that comes out as the bad guy‚Ä¶. üò™

I‚Äôm so fucking frustrated by all of this.  He is supposed to come over later today and I‚Äôm just like ‚Äúfuck this‚Äù, dealing with him feels impossible and I am over it.  Plus my wife is pissed, I‚Äôve talked to her about how frustrated I am, and she just doesn‚Äôt get it.  

What‚Äôs really bad is that I‚Äôve been having these little day dreams that I tell my doctor how stressed I am and he writes me some Xanax.  I have an appointment next week, and the addict part of me knows that I could probably play up how traumatic my kids birth was and chances are doc would give me Xanax, he gave me some last year because boo hoo teaching during the pandemic is hard poor me.  In my little fantasy I think ‚Äúit would be so convenient to take a Xanax when I need to get some rest, I could handle just taking one, no problem‚Äù.   I know this is a terrible idea, but I‚Äôm having a hard time telling myself ‚Äúbad idea, my friend‚Äù instead I‚Äôm like ‚Äújust play it by ear and see what you feel like doing in the moment‚Äù

I was not an alcoholic, just a casual weekend drinker, sometimes having too much poison inside of my body. 

This summer has been amazing. I travelled a lot, hang out with my friends, family, worked towards my personal goals and noticed some big improvements in mind-body connection.

For as long as I have known him, Eric has been dependent on alcohol. Four years ago when we were 22, I mistook his binge drinking as typical for our age.

Fast forward 2 years, Eric is 24-25 at this point and I notice that his drinking habits are becoming more frequent. I also notice that when he would drink, he would become mean and belligerent. He was sneaking drinks at this point, and he also ended up being arrested for DUI. After saying some hurtful stuff to me while he was drunk, and because I was having a hard time watching him destroy himself - I decided that it was time to lovingly cut him off. I set my boundary with him. In short‚Ä¶ I cannot allow myself to be berated by you. I think that you have a drinking problem. I hope that you find peace and get help. I‚Äôll be there for you when you make that decision. 

Eric and I don‚Äôt speak for another year and a half or so. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. Eric reaches out to say that he started going to therapy. Admitted that he wasn‚Äôt entirely sober, but that he drinks much less than he did before. He apologized for the way he treated me, and it felt genuine. So I asked if he would like to meet up. He agreed. 

A few days later, I go to pick Eric up and he‚Äôs wasted. He talks to me about how he can‚Äôt handle the emotions that had been coming up in therapy, so he quit going. He shares a lot of his past traumas with me. He also shares that he has been working with a recruiter to join the military. He believes that the structure will be good for him.

Over the course of a couple of months, I have been doing some ‚Äúcounseling‚Äù with Eric (my career is in the social work field). He admits to having an alcohol dependency, admits that it has ruined his life. He says that he‚Äôs banking on the military because he thinks it will help him - but he even agreed to go to treatment IF he isn‚Äôt accepted into the military. His alternative prior to this conversation was suicide. He said he would kill himself if he was not accepted into the military.

He was accepted- after apparently trying to get in for about a year. He had to jump through some hoops due to his previous alcohol related arrests. He swore in today. 

He called me a few hours later crying and talking about his past traumas and not being able to handle the stress of it all anymore. I ask him where he is, and I go to pick him up at that location. I show up to a gas station and I find him blacked out behind the building. I pick him up, put him in my car, and drive him to the hospital. At the hospital I explain that I believe he is a danger to himself and I sign the paperwork to have him involuntarily committed for mental health evaluation. 

He is furious with me, would not even look at me as he was being committed, and asked me to leave. I did.

Tomorrow I will attend a hearing for the court to determine Eric‚Äôs next steps. They could mandate inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, etc. 

I‚Äôm writing all of this because I feel like I did the wrong thing. I fear that I ruined Eric‚Äôs possible military career, and I fear that he will never forgive me. I have also read that addicts who are involuntarily committed have a slimmer chance at recovery than those who admit themselves.

Does anyone have experience with involuntary commitment? Are Eric‚Äôs chances at recovery slim? Did I do the wrong thing? Will he resent me now? Did I betray his trust?

Thank you to all in advance.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Like many, I really struggled through the early days of sobriety. I didn't know how to make it through my first Friday night, first social event, etc. One of the things I learned here at r/stopdrinking that helped me was that I needed to put my sobriety first, to make the decision not to drink my number one priority, and to protect it no matter what. This gave me the freedom to stop worrying about things that truly did not matter. Would I gain weight from eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's before bed? Doesn't matter, I didn't drink. Would I disappoint people by not showing up at happy hour? Doesn't matter, I didn't drink. 

&#x200B;

Over time, this practice of putting my sobriety first has evolved into a deeper understanding of letting go of things that no longer serve me. For me, this includes People-Pleasing. I still worry about what people will think or say about me, which gives me the opportunity to ask myself, ""why does it matter to me so much what this person thinks?"" or ""Am I really so important that I believe this person is thinking about everything I do? Does the world revolve around me?"" Sometimes I have to laugh at myself! Of course, I am still responsible for my actions and I work hard to not cause pain to others. But overall, I'm working on letting go of this fixation on chasing approval from other people. Because it doesn't matter, I didn't drink.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Hey everyone! It‚Äôs a very simple one this week. I‚Äôm grateful to have a job. It‚Äôs been a tough time for many people with a lot of us affected by redundancy or furlough - so I want to take the time to reflect on my gratitude for the fact that I‚Äôve maintained my job despite all the uncertainty brought about by COVID-19.

Before I applied to this role at the end of 2017, I was a mess. I took the role at the beginning of 2018 and it was both junior level and part-time; it was daunting because it was a step down on the career ladder. I was previously working at a more senior level at the previous job, but my drinking was getting out of hand and I needed to take a less demanding part-time thing to get my head right and get sober. It felt scary at the time, but I absolutely had to prioritise getting well. By a stroke of luck, by October that year I‚Äôd been bumped up to full time and I also took a promotion. I could not be more grateful for this to have been the case as it aligned with a time where I felt stronger in my sobriety and ready to take on the extra work. The extra money helped me pay off my debts.

At work, I‚Äôm fairly open about being sober. When I hit one year, one of my colleagues gave me a card that had been signed by the team. I was so touched and surprised. So I‚Äôm also very grateful for the supportive culture at my workplace.

That‚Äôs it from me. Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share whatever you‚Äôre appreciating, big or small.

Pretty chuffed about it and not something I thought I could achieve ever. Have not made very good life choices and despite that have managed to build a career and a home. Dysfunctional high functioning individual was my self image for a long time - daily drinking and smoking, staying up to the wee hours and waking up in the early afternoon. Rinse and repeat for 4 years (in my mid 30s). 

Started getting water retention in my calves towards the end of last year which I thought to be liver damage. Had an epiphany and decided to get my life in order. Found it easier to give it all up at once and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve made it so long. 

Biggest upside is the neurological changes I‚Äôm seeing - prioritising serotonin for long term well-being vs short term highs with dopamine. Overall a lot less anxious and ‚Äòexplosive‚Äô. And feels great to go to bed at 10pm, not set an alarm, and wake up naturally at 6ish, to have a few hours for yourself before work.

I started my own business and recently transitioned from a sole proprietorship to a corporation.  I met and married the most amazing woman.  I've learned to dance, and I mean really dance.

2- started to enjoy the ritual of planning meals, buying groceries and preparing new recipes 

3- woke up with my fianc√© and drank coffee every morning together before he headed out to work 

4- I am truly enjoying motherhood, it‚Äôs not always perfect but I have far more moments of connection and love with my daughter. She just turned 1, and she‚Äôs learning to give me kisses!

5- guilt free indulgences. I make chocolate chip cookies when I crave them, I order a Shirley temple when I want to be extra, I splurge on Amazon sometimes. And I truly enjoy spoiling myself in these small ways. 

6- I had an alcohol free vacation. I got way more vacation out of my vacation! No hangovers = longer days. No booze = more MONEY to spend on better shit. No buzz on the airplane = no landing at my destination feeling like shit. 

7- my self esteem is so much higher now that I know I‚Äôm capable of having and being fun without wine! And actually feel now I‚Äôm truly better without it. 

8- improved my relationship times a million. I‚Äôm nicer to my partner, I recognize and show appreciation when he deserves it. And when  we fight, I don‚Äôt wake up wondering if we would have had that argument ‚Äúhad I just been sober‚Äù. I make choices I know I can stand by even after a nights rest. 

9- libido UP, and orgasms more intense 

10- actually looking forward to the future for the first time in a long time. I could really only look forward to whenever I‚Äôd have alcohol next when I was drinking, and it didn‚Äôt matter what event was happening around the booze. Now I can truly live in the moment and feel excited for new experiences.

The first time someone pointed out I had unhealthy drinking habits was 2017. That's four fucking years ago. Two days ago, my girlfriend shook me awake in the bathtub because she thought I was dead. The toilet and floor were covered in vomit and I was passed out in the full bathtub. I blacked out and have no idea how I got there or remember vomiting. Honestly, I feel like I'm lucky I didn't die. I've blacked out before, but never like this. I've drank at work; in secret from bottles I had stashed around the house; and have not told my girlfriend how bad it's gotten. At all. 

I've been to addictions counselling, but the counsellor made me feel so awful. I've been prescribed Naltrexone, but that didn't help either. I've seen my neighbour and how alcohol has just taken over her life. I've seen my parent's friend lose everything. My life is pretty good, and I don't want to lose her, or my career. I'm terrified.

 I'm nearly 2 days in to being sober. It's hard, and I need to do this.

I hate going to the dentist. The small talk, the sitting in a chair with a bright light in your face, a stranger picking at your teeth. You know, the usual crap. Luckily today was better. It felt like a worthwhile dental appointment.

The hygienist seemed to fly through scraping the plaque off my teeth and mentioned they looked pretty good compared to last my last visit six months prior. I said, ""Well, I quit drinking a few months ago, so maybe that helped my teeth a bit.""

""OH IT CERTAINLY DOES! I'm really proud of you, what made you stop?""

""Idk. Just felt like I couldn't do it anymore. Something clicked in my head and I knew I had to stop.""

""Good for you, my son quit in May. We had to have an intervention for him and luckily he realized he should stop. I was there for his detox and was supportive of him the whole time. I could tell it was rough on him.""

We talked quite a bit about drinking. The liver and heart always gets all the attention but sobriety really does improve everything, even dental health. I'm sure we all know those days we didn‚Äôt brush because we're too nauseous to move a toothbrush properly! And the sugar and alcohol feeding bacteria in our mouths. The constant dry mouth. All the utter trash you eat before passing out: none of it helps your teeth and I guess that kinda hit me today. She stressed that it did help everything health-wise and of course it would help your teeth.

Told her how my mood improved and she understood that sobriety doesn't fix everything but does make your more able to actually face your problems. Told her I totally agreed and that I've been feeling pretty good. Like life sucks but I face things directly now instead of avoiding everything with a six/12/30 pack of beer from the gas station. My anxiety is actually manageable now. I feel alive now, all the good and the bad, and not like I'm in some hazy dream/nightmare all the time.

She asked if I went to AA -- said no, I did it solo -- but did namedrop this sub. A great place for those generally scared of people and groups but want a place to post/lurk and find those in the same situation that you're in.

I left and said, ""Well, tell your son that some random guy at the dentist office said 'good job' on his sobriety."" Is it weird to feel some kinship towards this stranger? Dude is 32, I'm 35, and he sobered up in April. I think mine is May. It's like this guy I don't even know is probably in the same place I am. Hell, his drink of choice was cheap gas station beer and vodka just like mine was! We were frugal drunks! 
 Now he's probably finally seeing the light after months of sobriety like I am. Finally realizing that things do actually get better and it wasn't all a lie. Knowing that he can function in life as fully aware, maybe even more aware, as everyone else. Still don't know the guy, probably never will, but damn I wish him (and everyone else) good luck going forward.

So yeah, pretty good visit to the dentist! A bit more deeper conversation than I'm used to but damn was it uplifting.",59,0

Only my former boss knows about my addiction struggles and sobriety.

During the dinner one of the girls, who is now a manager, talked about how her job has a mandatory ""stand down"" where once a month at 3pm all the managers go out to eat and get drunk. One of the other girls got a margarita and while I eyed it for a second (it looked pretty and I love liquor, especially mixed drinks) I lifted my eyes and focused on the conversation and the alcohol became less relevant as we continued to talk about work and our lives.

It helped to know I had the silent support of my former boss. She could have gotten a drink, I don't force my sobriety on anyone, but she didn't even look at the alcohol menu. Everyone else did or talked about alcohol, but my former boss did not. Before I resigned in July, we had a heart to heart where we both talked about our volatile relationships with our parents, our fathers' addiction struggles, and some of our mental health issues and treatments we've done... It just meant a lot that someone knew I was sober and was supporting me in a small way.

I am proud of myself. I was already nervous about going to a restaurant in a pandemic but did because I wanted to see my old coworkers and catch up. My determination to not drink even when I had people around me and at my table drinking, well, it was a big win in my book!

Well today I went by after my dad got off but mom had been off most of the day , so dad was OK but mom was a little tipsy ..nothing unusual that was my childhood .

We have a decent hour or so and  in the meantime dad slams a couple high abv beers while we are talking and things are OK still for a bit ..and then it happens . They start repeating everything we had talked about when I first got there . Normally I'm ok but tonight it just sat wrong and I had to get up and excuse myself home . Dad looked a bit sad and mom was extra clingy but I made my farewells anyway . 

I have learned to listen to my emotions and know that I have to set some boundaries.  Tonight as much as I wanted to hang out , hanging out longer would have been bad for my mental well being so I left and came home. I sent them a text explaining that I was sorry for leaving suddenly but it was because I felt my anxiety getting worse.  

They know that when they drink I don't like it and I know it is their choice so I don't harsh on them anymore.  Especially since I understand how hard it is to stop from my own struggles. All I can do is be open and honest about my feeling so they don't worry about me and I don't worry as much about them .

The headaches have been intense and the insomnia & anxiety is no fucking joke. These first few days have been so hard mentally. The second day I had a panic attack. Feeling my feelings suuucks and I've been bursting into tears randomly and often. Cravings have been non-stop and I've had to take it hour by hour. Usually after work around this time is when I would open my evening wine or beer but I've been guzzling LaCroix instead lately and been mostly doing good with that. Today LaCroix just didn't sound good enough and then those sneaky thoughts of ""just one beer won't hurt"" came and it takes so much energy to push them away. I'm not drinking but I'm also not getting anything else done around my house that I need to because I'm so mentally drained. I'm trying to give myself grace to just be lazy if that's what it takes to stay sober.

I attended my first AA meeting yesterday (online) and scoping out different groups to go in person but haven't worked up the courage yet. I've been listening to recovery lectures on YouTube every morning to set my daily intention that I won't drink. I've found some really inspiring channels on YouTube and I'm grateful to have a job that allows me to listen to what I want while I work. I've started to practice yoga, sometimes twice a day, and meditating. Having to keep sobriety #1 in my head and reminding myself that I can do this.

I am struggling so hard right now after a new move and new job. I did good in cutting off people around me that only want drinking buddies rather than friends, but the loneliness is really digging in. 

I‚Äôve taken 6 months off before, but then the longest friends I had, one went to jail over a shitty and unfair situation, another went too far with what I saw him doing in relation to drinking and drugs both, and my family is not even willing to entrain conversations other than ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a sinner‚Äù.

But the loneliness and childhood issues are hitting harder than ever. I know drinking isn‚Äôt getting me anywhere close to happy, but I need to find a community to help.

I have damaged so many relationships with alcohol. My romantic relationships and friendships are the ones that stand out but I‚Äôve also hurt my family many times. I know they will never give up on me but I know they respect me less for some of my behaviour. It‚Äôs awful. 

One of the relationships I lost was my first love. I know I was just an immature, confused teenager but it‚Äôs stil affects  me to this day. When we met up years later, he said he thinks we would have gotten married and even though I have gone on to have so much love and learning afterwards, I can‚Äôt help but wonder on that life that I missed out on. 

My husband had anger issues and so I divorced him but I hate reflecting on our marriage and thinking that my addictive behaviours were even 1% responsible for the breakdown of our relationship.

One of my friends also dumped me recently. He said that I invite trouble and it hurt so bad because it‚Äôs true.

On a positive note, when I don‚Äôt drink I feel wise and steady and I have so much more to give to those that I love.

So on that note, **hello everyone**, and thank you to the countless people who have posted their daily insights, struggles and successes.  I reach for certain posts over and over again with the hope that today will be the day that I just ""get it"".  And not some inner plea to get it, **actually and really** **get it**...**permanently**.

I have been struggling with AUD for about a decade (I am 37F for reference).  There was never really a moment in time where I normalized my relationship with alcohol, it's always been on my radar as extremely problematic behaviour and it's always been clear to me that I use it to self medicate.  I have ADHD and struggle with impulse control, and alcohol is one of a few main avenues for temporary relief of my over active brain (food and shopping being the other two).  I absolutely berate myself over my AUD and other challenges with impulse control, a product of the condition itself but also my crippling perfectionism that disables me from accepting even the tiniest flaw.  As you can imagine, my inner talk track is violent, often to the point of terrorizing myself in a way that I would not wish on my worst enemy.

I have had periods of sobriety, more so in recent months as I embark down a more serious journey towards freedom.  Without question in these periods of not drinking I am so much happier and I know this.  Not having to worry about filling liquor bottles with water to hide how much I am drinking, empties that I hide in the garbage, in my closet, in my drawers, in our basement storage pile that I hope will never be organize.  EXHAUSTING.  I don't have a desire to drink, but my cravings keep sucking me back in and I feel like a hamster on a wheel.  This feeling is so infuriating, to want so badly to be rid of something, but to be caught in its unrelenting grip.  Day after day the same actions, the same end result.  Rinse repeat.  This is the definition of crazy, so naturally crazy is what I feel that I have become.

I have read ALL the books on this, from The Big Book, to Naked Mind, to EasyWay...and loads more.  They all make sense to me, the logical part of me who longs to align my actions with my knowledge that alcohol is an insidious poison that is robbing me of everything good and that freedom is just around the corner.  The understanding and inner negotiation that I am choosing ethanol over my life.  It's painful in a way I know all of you understand.

Anyways, I am going to try again tonight.  I keep telling myself to be kind, and that I am making progress...if I compare to a year ago, I am drinking much less.  But it's so hard not to feel like there really is no way out from this, even though I know clearly that there is.

For anyone else struggling, just know that you are not alone, far from it.  For every person that creates a post, there are so many more just like me who haven't posted frequently or at all but are suffering and getting up the courage or even motivating to post.   Despite everything I have said above, I have not lost hope and I refuse to.  I know there is light at the end of this extremely dark tunnel.

Went out for dinner for the first time since day 0,"I should probably write this in a private journal. :P There is just something that makes it more satisfying to post and share on SD.

My buddy and I decided to go out to a restaurant for a change, and I was pretty confident. I have read posts on here before of people's first accounts back in a restaurant or pub since they have been sober; However, going through it myself being over two weeks dry was quite a challenge, to be honest. It was like my brain wanted to jump out of my skull and grab the closest drink it could find - This was scary for me.

To make matters worse, I had to get up and clumsily ask for anything non-alcoholic. I felt highly embarrassed, and my buddy noticed how awkward I was trying to casually order a NA drink while his first pint was almost finished. I managed to get NA beer, and now the barman is up to speed with my preference (just like probably half of the f\*\*ing restaurant), and I start to regain some lost confidence. Now my friend is on his 2nd pint, and like so many on SD have shared, he was noticeably drunk after one and a half pints, being very jolly and talkative. He asked if we can stay for just one more, and I agreed, but I think he noticed that I increasingly did not want to be there anymore. After the third pint, I am ready to grab the nearest waiter to pay the damn bill and run. He then asked if I am ready or can we stay for the last one, and I just had to say, ""sorry, I need to go.""

At least I made it home still sober and sipping on a nice cup of tea. I did not think it would be so difficult for me and my brain played the worst kind of tricks on me. I will have to figure something out because this will hurt my social life at some point, and I know it does not have to be this way.",18,0

I'll preface this post with a bit of background; I have been drinking too much for too long, with sober spurts here and there (2 sober pregnancies included). I started drinking when I was 14 y/o and am 34 now. I rationalized in high school as being rebellious and trying to fit in. In college, it was being young and stupid. As it progressed, it was just too much. I didn't hide it. I can't have one drink, it's always seeking the next one and counting down the seconds until the end of the work day. About a year ago I started hiding it, as my husband was concerned. The shame of collecting my hidden vessels on trash day morning...overwhelming. A tale as I've read on this sub many, many times while lurking the last couple of years.

Saturday night started out innocent enough. Made an excuse to go out, citing the severe increase in stress at work and the development of panic attacks and anxiety in the recent months (Hindsight: could have helped being sober dealing with it...) Anyway, I went to a brewery with a friend, had one beer. We decided it would be so fun to blow off steam and to go to the casino (where I have a rich history of drinking to excess, but never driving home). With that clue, you can guess - I was pulled over and arrested for DUI. Gross misdemeanor, blowing a .23.

I got out of county jail on Monday afternoon and have been getting my affairs in order ever since. I am so lucky that my husband is compassionate and supportive, and I need to be 100% prioritizing my family, no matter what my brain is telling me. I am fortunate to be able to take a leave from my job while I get everything sorted, get in to an IOP, and start up with meetings. I see my therapist today and my psychiatrist tomorrow.

It is mortifying. I am so ashamed. Silver lining: I can't help but feel that this is the wake-up call I've been ""waiting"" for. I have tried so hard to give myself wake-up calls, talk myself out of drinking again, ""today is the last day."" There is always another excuse to drink. Always.  

I need to do this for myself; my health, my family, my mental well-being. I plan on hanging around in this sub a lot; much inspiration and support to be found.

Anyway, this is me at Day 3. IWNDWYT.",36,0

Last night, after drinking an absurd amount of high alc content beer, I spent multiple thousands of dollars in a span of two minutes. I got up from my computer desk and put on my motorcycle helmet and walked outside to my bike. Upon lifting the kickstand to move the kickstand puck/platform, I knocked the stand to the right a bit. When placing the bike back down, it collapsed onto the ground, marring the plastic fairings and bending the handlebars. Enraged, I pulled the emergency release on my helmet and chucked it across the street then proceeded to lift my bike back in place. Since I park my motorcycle behind my car on nights I plan to ride it the next day, I overcompensated and pushed the bike into my trunk and created a dent with heavy gouging and scratches that exposed the metal beneath. 

I was furious. I went inside and proceeded to punch my weight bench extensively (my go-to since it's soft) then went on to punching my door frame. Now, as I type this I'm rearranging the ice pack I had to bring to work and lie about. I said, ""I accidentally stripped a bolt on my motorcycle and the wrench slipped causing me to bash my hand into the engine."" My Arai Corsair X that I have only had for a year was cracked and marred rending it unusable and unsafe to ride with. My nearly $1000 helmet is in the trash can. I ordered $800 worth of plastic parts, a new handlebar, and a mirror to replace on my bike. I don't know how much it would cost to fix the massive dent in the trunk of my car, but I'm sure it's not cheap. As for my hand, I'm going to the doctor's tomorrow. Thankfully, I have insurance. Thankfully, I live alone and no one had to experience my temper tantrum. 

I never really considered myself a heavy drinker or alcoholic until I realized that I hadn't spent a full week not drinking one or multiple days over the last 6 years. I usually hid my drinking because my old roommate and his girlfriend called me out and said I was annoyingly loud and obnoxious to live with. Looking back, I most certainly was. I eventually only drank on the weekends, heavily, getting close to backing out or just collapsing at my desk altogether. My roommate, who was also my closest friend, left for Poland last year to work and that is when my increased isolation and no oversight caused me to begin drinking every other day. I gained 45lbs since then and have put myself into dangerous situations many times. I would drive buzzed to 7/11 to get more alcohol or food, I destroy things like the many computer peripherals I go through, and last night I believe I have hit rock bottom. 

I don't really know where to proceed from here. Tonight, I was invited to go out to eat with my coworker and a few of his friends. Should I go? How do I explain that I'm an alcoholic when I get water/tea when everyone else orders drinks? I normally get pretty hammered during the scant few times I am able to socialize. If you take the time to read this I sincerely thank you, I am ultimately confused about what my next step should be. I am moving out of the country to the UK in September, so unfortunately joining a group or meeting with AA here isn't feasible. I also don't feel if I would belong in such places since I do not drink as heavily as others. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",29,0

The first time I attempted to quit drinking about a year ago the anxiety was so bad I could not focus for work. I felt a constant sense of impending doom that made living a normal life feel near impossible. I went to my doctor and was prescribed a low dose anti depressant SSRI which pretty much fixed all my anxiety issues. My anxiety was so much better, but some of the side effects from this medication (and apparently most SSRI's) was decreased (basically non existent) libido and inability to orgasm (I did warn you about the TMI). After a year with a non existent libido I asked my doctor for help. Apparently it is too much to ask to remain alcohol free, not have anxiety and to have some ""drive"". We agreed to take me off of the medication and for me to just deal with the anxiety. And here I am, 5 days off meds, 30+ days alcohol free, in a state of panic and unable to focus. Will this ever go away? Are there any tips or tricks you all have used to get through/lessen the anxiety?",19,0

Not anymore! :-),"Yesterday marked day 40 of my emotional sobriety detox. I am new to this thread, however, if you read my first post you'll note I decided to embark on a no drinking detox. I would be lying if I said I did not struggle or slip up the first week. I definitely did. I never thought I had an issue with drinking nor that I was so dependent on it until I intentionally stopped. Drinking has been such a natural part of my life. I never saw it as something that negatively impacted me as I would not drink daily and I was rarely ever hungover. I saw myself as a social drinker, someone who would only drink on weekends.

What made me stop? after deciding to dive into a deep healing journey with my new soulmate therapist, I realized my emotional turmoil was magnified when I would drink. My toxic traits & behaviors would emerge most when drinking. Dealing with heartbreak, insecurities, lack of self-worth, drinking was a coping mechanism. I realized I would want to drink most when triggered, stressed, or when I felt most inadequate or not good enough. Drinking would give me courage, help me loosen up, give me confidence, or so I thought. Maybe it did for a moment but it was short-lived once I would come home to myself and my thoughts. It was only numbing and distracting me from truly feeling what I needed to feel. Learning more about myself, observing myself and my own emotional toxicity is showing me how much I am capable of change. Not drinking has brought forth so much clarity.

Placing myself in situations where I used to feel like I had to drink to thrive in the environment, i.e. salsa dancing, concerts, music festivals, family parties, etc.,  and choosing not to has been a game-changer!  I feel so powerful, unstoppable, and most importantly self-aware of my presence & magnetism. People gravitate towards me and my energy. I believe drinking used to fog my brain from truly seeing this. I do not need alcohol to have a great time, I am fun regardless! The only difference now is I truly believe it because I am proving it more and more to myself with each day I stay consistent with my sobriety. Not every day is easy, some days are harder than others. For instance, last night I was really close to buying one drink at the bar before dancing. I purposely left cash and my credit card in the car so I could not purchase any alcohol. The thought of walking back to my car to quickly grab my money so I could buy a drink did occur, however, I did not do it. As uncomfortable as I felt, I stayed and started dancing with anyone and everyone who asked me to dance. I danced the night away filling my soul and connecting to my body sober. It was amazing! No matter how tempted I become and or how badly I want a drink, each day that I continue to not drink makes me feel elated on a different level. It's a high I can't quite explain. All I know is that I feel powerful, unstoppable and I am here to share my journey. Day 40 and counting...",21,0

I have been dealing with family issues for over a year now (mom who's a narcissist, dad who supports her, a sister who wants to be an aunt to my boys and still a daughter to my estranged parents especially since she still has to rely on them, and a wife who has been blamed for everyone else's issues, even though the issues were there long before they met her).  It has been a real Rollercoaster, dealing with the random texts and not knowing if someone is sucking up to make it all go away, or if it's an outright attack against my wife (only one physical threat, but the rest were verbal).  Through all of this, including the messages today that has had me on the edge all morning, I realized how much worse all of this would have been had I still been drinking.  I would have absolutely wallowed in self pity and a bottle, ignoring how it was hurting my wife, and impacting my kids.  Part of what has made all of this so hard has been the fact that I have been sober, I have had to face my emotions and figure out why I was angry all the time.  But it finally hit me today, that's because that is what you are supposed to do.  Hiding from issues, hoping they fix theirself or go away, or at least don't matter anymore.  Setting boundaries and working through what you can handle, that is what I have and still am learning how to do for the first time in my life.  And it all started with that first boundary of ""I will not drink today"".  All of that to say, if you think life sucks, remember that when you are drinking through it, at least the way I was, you typically are only ""skipping"" from problem to problem, and you may be missing the good things in between.  The things that help you remember why it's worth it.  Because otherwise, if you are only skipping from crappy moment to crappy moment, it really isn't worth it.  It is worth it to face the issues you can handle and work through them. They don't just go away, they build up, and there is most definitely compound interest too.

It has to be wine, most likely sparkling. The birthday is for my parents' business partner who we are friendly with but not super close so I really dont want to offend him. 

I wanted to know what you all thought of my plan: accept the first drink graciously and participate in the toast. When it comes to drink it, pretend to sip but with my lips pressed closed - no one will be looking closely at my mouth on the rim of the wine glass. Then, later in the meal, reiterate that I dont enjoy the taste of alcohol (especially wine) which the group have already heard from me on a different occasion. Leave the wine glass undrunk or pass it off to my mum or dad. 

What do you all think? That would still be maintaining sobriety right, because I'm not actually taking any in? 

I'm not too concerned about actually being tempted by drinking during the event. In the instance of socialising with people I dont really know and want to impress, adding the stress of relapsing is the furthest from my mind. It's just the toast that's a bit of a snag.

You turned a poison into an enemy. You made it something you need control over, like something you need to tame or defeat. You point at it relapse after relapse, hangover after hangover, shaking your fist, claiming ""you won't get me next time!"" 

And in there lies the trap. 

You cannot tame a poison. You cannot tame a substance that in real-time messes with your brain chemistry. You are human, vulnerable and neurologically malleable. You cannot hurt alcohol - its ethanol. Your relationship with it only leaves you hurt - because it's supposed to. 

Let it humble you, like a large fire or a deep cold sea. Respect this chemical - you can't overcome being engulfed in flames nor drowning by the sea. Every shot of alcohol only does damage because that's what it's suppose to do! Ethanol doesn't care it's killing your neurons, but your brain cares that ethanol is killing it. 

Don't be cautious. Stop worrying about relapsing -it only laughs at your face when you do. Your caution about relapsing stems from your fear that you may never get over this, this is what the alcohol industry wants you to feel! 

Raise your white flag and see alcohol for what it is. You are powerless over it because YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. 

Take a deep breath, stop counting your relapses or sobriety days, and let come what may. It is only in absolute submission and humble defeat that you can truly taper away from this lifestyle.

I'd quit drugs a few months before I quit drinking, but both needed to happen. Heavy drinking and heroin don't lead to a long life... I'd nearly died a few times before anything stuck.

There's been a lot of life in the past 16 years. I wouldn't have been around for the good things had I still be drinking/using. Given some of the really heavy bad stuff, I'm not sure I would have made it out alive during some of the really bad things. I always evaluate things at the end of a year, and I'm hoping to be 17 next year at this time.

I've learned over the years that support is key. Drinking dreams, stress, and bad times in life still happen sometimes (thankfully a lot less than in the first few years). Dealing with some of the mental health stuff that led me into drinking helped A LOT. I tend to lean on friends and my faith community during the hard times (and stay connected in good times). Most of my relapses early on probably wouldn't have happened if I'd have had friends consistently in my life, a connection to faith, and resources to deal with traumatic and grief stuff.

The main character loses his job and marriage due to his alcoholism. After being let go from his job he finds all his belongings on his house's front lawn, realizing that he has lost his wife as well. For most of the rest of the movie he drinks 500ml can beers - he sits on a couch on his front lawn with a bar fridge next to him stacked with beer. The following day I bought 2 sixpacks 500ml cans of beer. The movie didn't make me think about how alcohol can mess up a person's life, it just gave me a crazy craving for beer, resulting in a relapse.",12,0

After spending time in this sub, the term 'myth of moderation' seems to be thrown around quite a lot. The meaning I've derived from this is you're either a full blown alcoholic or stone cold sober and there can't possibly be any middle ground to drink responsibly. I understand that the 'what the hell, I'll just have one beer' attitude can be a slippery slope for some people but there are many people who are able to drink responsibly and keep their shit together; may this be an occasional glass of wine with dinner, a cocktail while on holiday or a beer or two on a Friday night.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't had a drink since my first post on this sub and I'm not looking for an excuse to start drinking again. But is there really no way for anyone to enjoy alcohol responsibly and in moderation? I understand that drinking is bad for you, but so are plenty of other things. I'm sure many of you have devoured a takeaway pizza, played poker with friends, treated yourself to a shopping trip or stayed at home to binge watch Netflix. Just like drinking, excessive participation in these activities can lead to some serious problems (obesity, debt, antisocial behaviour and inactivity),  but once in a while is generally accepted to be okay. Why is alcohol the exception?

I'm sure a lot of people reading this probably have, or have had a problem with drinking and I am in no way trying to justify picking up the bottle again. Are some people just wired differently that they can control their drinking more effectively? Does the myth of moderation apply to everyone or just people with addictive tendencies?",26,0

The night before started like most. Go out for 1 drink, have 10. Promise myself not to drive, drive home blacked out. Eat way too much Taco Bell. Wake up half way through the night terrified. Talk myself out of killing myself.   


So, like many times before, I told myself I was done with alcohol but I was scared I would fail again. So what would make this time different?  


First, admitting that I was not only an alcoholic but a drug addict. I had trouble with this because, I mean was I worthy of claiming such lofty afflictions? I never drank in the morning, I didn't even drink everyday. I didn't dabble in hard drugs. I had a good job, I had friends. Surely I didn't fit the mold. So what made me an addict? The binge drinking, the daily weed smoking, the hunger for escape and willingness to grab a bag of coke, tab of acid, bumps of molly whenever they presented themselves. It was always feeling the need to be high on whatever, and a feeling that my life wouldn't be interesting if I wasn't. That my identity was who I was on these substances.  


How did I overcome this? By fundamentally reshaping my subconsciousness' relationship with these substances. A reshaping of a belief system of I had developed where drugs/alcohol make life more fun, manageable. In fact, coming to realize that they do the opposite.  


What has changed in a year? An incredible amount.  
\- Lost a ton of friends, found true friendships  
\- Stopped being a passenger in my own life and took control   
\- Confidence  
\- Read everyday  
\- Exercise everyday  
\- Maintain a healthy weight/diet  
\- Closer with my family  
\- More reliable  
\- Anxiety and depression are manageable  
\- Not wasting beautiful days  
\- Developed as a songwriter and guitarist  


The list goes on and as I spontaneously typed that out I was happy to see more positives than negatives. Truth is though, I've become much lonelier. I am naturally an introvert, loner even. I think in the beginning, latching on to alcohol and drugs was my solution for this because I saw it as negative. But its who I am, and It is better to be that than faking it as someone else. I truly believe in the power of future connections I will make, not relationships with people to get something from them (drugs, sex, cheap companionship).  


My big take away is this  


My life went from one of doubt and deception to one of hope and promise.   


Keep going guys, its worth it.

&nbsp;

I had about a month of sobriety under my belt, first time trying it in earnest. During that time, I discussed it with friends and family who all said the same thing: ""You don't seem to have a problem."" ""You could probably just watch yourself and be fine."" etc. I agreed with them and went back to having a few drinks. Here is my progression:

&nbsp;

* Day 1: 2 beers
* Day 2: Nothing (See? I'm fine.)
* Day 3: 3 beers (one in secret to avoid judgement)
* Day 4: 1 hard seltzer, 3 beers, unknown amount of gin out of the bottle alone in the basement
* Day 5: Nothing again (freaked myself out)
* Day 6: Bottle of wine, 8 beers, opened a second bottle of wine but never got to it before I passed out

&nbsp;

That was about 5 days ago. It scared me, but it showed me very clearly that I can't have just 1 or 2. Thanks to this community, I was able to see the signs pretty quickly and get off the slope. A cautionary tale, and hopefully a learning experience that pushes me forward. IWNDWYT.",79,0

(and yes, this is being written because upcoming anniversaries tend to make me reflective.)

I also had to get over the ""it wasn't so bad"" thoughts I'd get when I had a week sober - get over the rationalization of, 'If I drink tonight it will still be an 85% reduction', ultimately being told I couldn't drink, even if it was by myself, was the part I rebelled against the most.  In part because I still told my self there was some good to drinking....

My middle name is ""don't tell me what to do""  never on my report cards was ""follows directions well"" ever checked.  In a lot of ways I was a spoiled brat.  That's easy to say now, back then I would have copped an attitude for a week over that idea.

I had to stop thinking I was special, that there was a loophole with my name on it.  I had to realize that my best thinking was not getting me to places where I wanted to be.

**None of this was easy. Especially since I was undergoing physical changes and it was a warped self-esteem that had gotten me into this in the first place.**  It was also difficult because I was having to switch the blame for my ""failures"" from circumstances to me.

I could not do it alone and, to my utter amazement, found that AA worked for me despite my anti social suspicious nature, my agnostic understandings, and again, being told what to do.  But it was, for the first time in my life, a place where I felt people  understood me, where I was accepted for who I was, not what I was pretending to be.  That was huge.  And the people were amazing, and diverse, and I heard other people saying things I'd thought I was the only person to think or do.  Suddenly I was not so alone...and believe me I had been SO ALONE for quite a while.

I had to come to terms with the fact that drinking was not my problem so much as a symptom of my problems.  I also had to grow up and not expect my life to become wonderful in the first week or two.  I had debris to clear not the least of which was the self esteem I'd twisted into knots over the years.

As for something good being taken from me.  That was a lie.  My drinking was no longer fun. I was not the guy on the stone terrace looking out over the harbor at Monaco chatting with a Contessa who would offer me the use of her estate in Tuscany while I finished my novel. no.  I was the guy who scuttled in and out of the liquor store, or drank in dingy bars where you were glad nobody started talking to you.  

The good news is it was all worth it.  And then some.  The short version is; I am happy.  I am comfortable in my own skin. I have everything I need and then some. There are imperfections in my life, some significant, but I don't have to let them control it.",241,0

It was depressing me everyday drinking. I was getting tired of this shit. That late evening on the 24, it hit me.

For context, I am a guy turning 29 next week. 

In the last 6 months, in order of events, the following has happened in my life: my fiance's little brother passed away, we got married, my (now) wife finished graduate school, I finished graduate school, and we bought a house, which closes in 3 weeks.

The unexpected passing of my BIL was undoubtedly one of the hardest experiences my wife's family and I have ever been through. This happened about 4 weeks into my sobriety. I am thankful I was able to be 100% for my wife and her family during this time, as turning to the bottle would have been easy way to escape. As a family, we are still working through these feelings and loss of a family member, but it is still very difficult to return to normal. 

The rest of the events in my life are generally considered happy experiences, but my generalized anxiety makes these big life changes difficult at times. I am grateful that I was sober for my wedding, as it was always a fear of mine that I would send it too far on my big day, make a fool of myself, disappoint my wife, and feel the subsequent shame.

I had been lurking this community for a few years prior to my sobriety. I knew I had an issue and I wasn't reaching my full potential as a person or a spouse. No major event happened that made me stop, I just decided to try a week off the booze. I made it a week and thought I'd tried two. Then lent was coming up and was a convenient reason to not be drinking and a test to see if I could make it. Slowly but surely the ball kept rolling onward to this 6 month mark.

I made two weeks. Two weeks for the first time I think in two years other than my brief quarantine period last March, and I finally got through physical WD symptoms.. but life hasn't really let up, yknow? In the past two weeks I've spent almost every night staring at the ceiling begging for something to interest me or cure my boredom, distract myself from infinitely spinning thoughts and clearly, clearly alcohol is the way to go, right? its the easiest way, at least. 

Two weeks dry. I am extremely proud, but I still fucked up. i still justified drinking again. I justified drinking on the 14th day because my friends came by and brought some craft beer. I'm a sucker for that. It was okay, because I only drank a fifth of a standard beer, right? I had to because it was a fancy watermelon ale, it was too good to pass up, this wont affect my sobriety! However, they asked me to come over again the next day for a new sour ale- my favorite type of beer, so it was ok- yeah? I'm just there to taste the craft drinks, not to get drunk! One beer turned into two that night. It was still ok, because I stopped at two- an alcoholic would never stop at just two, im cured!

Then my partner had some leftover drinks in his fridge- it would be ok if I had one to loosen up and enjoy my show a bit, right? Well very clearly this fell into a slippery slope and Ive slipped three days so far, each day leading to more drinking than the last. 

I'm really upset I lost that two week streak. But now I'm on day 3 again, and feeling good. Time to be serious. I cant believe I so quickly forgot how much fucking fear I was in just a few weeks ago. What the fuck is wrong with me?

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Today, I'm going to focus on putting down my phone and noticing the moments of beauty around me. The neighborhood cats on my morning walk, the sunflowers towering over me in the sidewalk gardens, the beautifully played piano music that accompanies my dance classes. It was so much harder to appreciate these moments when I was drinking. On a walk, I would be obsessed with what bar I could stop at, and who needs dance class when there's wine? It's the sad irony of drinking to feel alive, when in fact, I missed out on so much of the life happening around me.

So i'm on my 30th day. Something I haven't reached in decades so I just wanted to share an update on what 30 days means to me so far.

I now have an amazing relationship with my kids and spend HUGE amounts of time playing and hanging out with them. When my wife an I separated I was so worried about how it would affect the kids I ended up drinking more and more to cope with my depression, which as we all know only makes things worse. My proudest moments on this journey are when my sons come to stay. The first thing they ask is ""have you had any beer daddy?"" and when I reply ""no"" they always respond with ""we are really proud of you daddy"". That in itself means the world to me.

As for direct impacts on myself, I look like a typical overweight beer drinker, late forties and 240lbs. Since I stopped drinking I've embraced how good everything/myself feels. Rather than boozing every night until the wee hours and waking up hungover to attempt work, I try to finish most jobs around the home nice and early. Cook a healthy meal (I used to eat a big meal and then get McDonalds at midnight when drinking), exercise, watch a show and relax, drink a herbal tea, hot bath, melatonin and then read in bed to then wake up at 5:30am for boot camp exercise. I NEVER could have done this a month ago.

It's amazing just how good each day feels and how productive we can be with the time that was taken up by drinking.

For some stats, I'm on my 30th day and so far I have:

Freed up 145 hours of drinking/memory loss time to use more productively with the kids and on myself

Saved myself from 70,000 alcoholic calories (and burnt a whole lot more now that I exercise)

Saved myself $1200 USD usually spent on alcohol and drunk junk food

Lost 11 pounds, mostly just from cutting the booze and diet as exercise has only been the last 4 days.

I still have moments of panic and fear when I crave a cold beer. I worry that I won't always be strong, even though my sober mind knows I don't need that beer. I really don't and I'm happy without it.

All I can do at the moment is focus on each day.

My brain will think well if I don't drink tonight I'm not going to have a fun night, and it's back to work in the morning. 

It seems very obvious, but it dawned on me lately that while alcohol may seem to give me a fun night, it gives me an awful nights sleep and an absolutely dreadful morning the next day. 

I realized that the only way I can assure that I will have a good time in the future is to make my mornings as good as possible by not waking up hungover. Even if I have a rather uneventful night, it's instantly made up for if I can wake up feeling refreshed with no regret.",20,0

I just wanted to type out how I'm feeling so I'm sorry if it's not interesting. Basically I've been sober a little over six months, my goal was to make it to a year and then reevaluate everything after a year but in reality I don't ever want to go back to drinking the way I was. Even thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach and I can feel pre sober me's anxiety and dread. 99% of the time I'm totally cool and proud to not be drinking and I cherish my sobriety and the changes its brought me. Getting sober though has sobered me up to a lot of things that are unpleasant too. Such as my relationship. It's complicated and I will spare you the details. I'm not happy in it and I want to leave but like everything else in life it's much easier said than done :/ 


Anyway, my friend wants to hang out and asked me if I wanted to have a couple drinks and I really really want to but I know where that path will lead me and it isn't good. I feel the reason I want to is because I want to self sabotage. I don't feel in control of my life right now and I want to screw what little I do have control over up. Self sabotaging is so weird. I'm glad I can now at least see it for what it is now but damn, it's really hard to seperate what "" I really want "" and what my inner self is lying to me about. Tug of war. But I have to believe my true inner self would not want to self sabotage. But at the same time I don't want to stay home.  Staying in the relationship makes me want to drink but also I know if I go through the emotional turmoil of leaving and the crazy amount of stress that would cause would also make me want to drink. Catch 22. But I do know that being sober helps both of those things as drinking would only amplify the shit. Ugh. Just needed to write all this out. 

I love you all üíû

So I've got a couple days no drinking under my belt, and I've had many stretches of time in the past but whenever I'm sober I feel lonely.

I'm 30, I live by myself, I work from home and I'm single. I try to have a pretty active social life but there are just days where all my friends are busy. Sometimes many days. I'm pretty much always alone at bed time unless I stay at a friends. I wake up alone. 

When I go to bed drunk I don't feel lonely. I might not feel ""good"", but not lonely. And when I wake up  kind of hungover I'm blurry, not lonely. 

I have issues dating because of my trauma history and autism. I haven't been in a serious relationship since I was like 23. I honestly don't know if I'm ever going to find anyone and most of the time I'm okay with that cause I have other kinds of love but...

Tonight I am anxious and sad and I would feel better if I could just be next to someone but no one is here. When I have a bottle of wine in me I don't lay in bed lamenting, I just bring one more glass with me to bed and fuck around on my phone until I pass out.  

I do not want to do that anymore but I also do not want to feel this way. I'm in therapy and on medications, but unfortunately no one has invented a pill or therapy modality that cures lonliness yet so I don't know what to do.

Last year was really hard, like for many others, with covid shut downs, losing my job, and losing a fur baby. I somehow got the strength to get myself together. 

I take many walks, journal, read books, read this sub reddit, and hit the gym. I also got a new job this year and that's been going really well.

I stopped drinking May 25, 2020 and became a non-drinker May 25, 2021. I say it this way because originally stopping drinking was only a test for myself  - we were in Shelter in Place and I had started drinking more at home than before. Previously, drinking and socializing went hand in hand - it was my way of justifying heavy drinking (‚Äújust one more‚Äù). However Zoom happy hours lost their charm incredibly quickly causing me to try testing myself by stopping drinking until Shelter in Place lifted. Well, one month turned into two. Two into three. Three into six. It then became a game for me: could I make it to one year?

As I approached one year I really started thinking about all the benefits that I had achieved from not drinking. I‚Äôd gotten back to a healthy weight, was running 30 miles a week, didn‚Äôt have to plan ahead for hangovers or if we had enough alcohol on hand. I even found my memory gradually improving (not just morning after memory but just in general). I was also surprised I didn‚Äôt have the social pressure that I always felt like I‚Äôd get for not drinking - in fact, no one seemed to really care I wasn‚Äôt drinking and even appreciated it when I could drive them around as sober driver! So, instead of celebrating one year sober by drinking I instead decided that being a non-drinker really worked for me. 

Well, today is my birthday and 15 months since my last drink. Upon reflection, sobriety is the greatest gift I‚Äôve ever given myself. I feel incredibly grateful for this feeling and for escaping the the downward spiral drinking was leading me down.

Anyway, no real purpose for this post - just wanted to share it with someone!

I'm happy I did.,"I'll be honest: I was incredibly bored. When my friend messaged me to come over, I figured it'd beat sitting at home and playing video games.

So off I went, and no sooner did I step through the door than my friend handed me a beer--even after I told him that I was taking a break from booze. I tore off the lid, put it on the table, and tried to catch up.

Of course, it being 3am, everyone was about as drunk as I'd expected. My friend was very desperately trying to convince two women to stay just a little longer. When they declined, he drunk-called a mutual acquaintance--a former classmate--no fewer than two-dozen times in the space of some twenty minutes. I almost died from second-hand embarrassment, all while reflecting on how often I'd done the exact same thing.

I'm not here to laugh at my friend, or put him down: I've been in his shoes, dozens--if not hundreds--of times. While I've been in a relationship for some years, I've certainly harassed my comparably-sober buddies more times than I'd care to admit.

But being there, dead-sober, and seeing someone else do what I'd done put things in a very fresh perspective. Is this how I came across, on so many nights, in so many places, in front of so many friends and strangers?

I've no doubt.

And I've no doubt now that I never want to go back to being the guy who wakes up with a hangover, afraid of who he may have called, texted, or hurt the night before. While it might be 5 o'clock in the morning, I get to go to sleep with a clear conscience, assured that I won't start the day with a headache or any half-remembered regrets.

I won't say that's a privilege, because so many people don't take drinking to the level I always did. But it's a privilege for me, and one I'll aspire to keep.

Even more grandchildren and even some great-grandkids. Bought a plane with a work buddy and became a civil pilot. Graduated Purdue in Electrical Engineering while raising those kids.

When my dad kicked me out 6 years ago and I was staying with him, he expressed his concern about my drinking. I wish I had listened and understood then. 6 years on, I've likely got health problems from the hard drinking I've done.

I have to be sober. I don't know how much time he has, but I have to be sober. When his wife, my grandma, suddenly died 5 years ago, I had a beer before we even left to go to the hospital. At her wake (very Irish Catholic), I drank a lot. To the point my closest cousin pulled me aside and talked to me about how he felt I was dishonoring her. And yet I still didn't stop.

Anyways, I guess I‚Äôm posting to say I won‚Äôt drink more this week. I‚Äôm out of alcohol, yay. I WANT to buy more, but I won‚Äôt. I absolutely hate how I feel right now emotionally/mentally but drinking will not solve my problems. I *need* to deal with my crap sober.

It included things like alcoholism running in my family, frequent and intense hangovers, black outs (not super often but honestly just 1 is too many,) making regretful ""romantic"" choices with people I didn't even like...it went on for several more points. But the other half of me didn't want to quit at all, I loved drinking and being drunk, the way it allowed me to forget a lot of my problems for a night and make me feel fun. It seemed essential to my social life and was the way I had met every partner in my 20s. Luckily, my rational brain won out and I haven't had a drink since the night I made that list. I was almost 29 then and am now coming up on 31. There have been many ups and downs, but I can honestly say that I've only had 1 or 2 cravings in the past 12 months. 99% of my days, I am so happy to be a non-drinker who deals with the joys and sorrows of life head-on. A non-drinker who prioritizes my mental and physical health. Who was lucky enough to match with another non-drinker over a year ago and be in the happiest relationship of my life. The quitting alone will not solve all your problems, but it is a great first step.

I thought I'd write down a few things I'm looking forward to as I stop drinking, so that I could remind myself why I need to do this.

First and foremost I look forward to waking up rested, no hangovers, no miserable nights in the bathroom, accompanied by guilt and shame. 

Being able to eat and enjoy food once more. Since my drinking went out of hand, I've been unable to properly swallow food and often choke a lot. Everytime I decrease my drinking, it fades away. Will likely seek a doctor for it soon anyways. 

Being able to remember everything I have said and done, without feeling guilty about it. It occurred to me I begin to forget more and more what I've done the night prior. I'm losing precious moments of my life, moments with friends and family, simply because I'm unable to recall entire events that occurred. I need to an end to it.

 Feeling and looking healthy. Since things went out of hand, I have looked the worst I have in... ever. Recently I had found a folder on my old computer, with pictures of me prior to alcohol. I realized how much happier and healthier I looked. No sickly complexion and sandpaper-like skin. No unexplained bruises. No white hairs, which I've gotten rather quickly and out of nowhere, which people often point out and it sucks. I felt like a husk of that person on the photos. Alcohol had really stripped me of whatever passion for life I had.

And lastly for now, finally being able to once again enjoy my hobbies. Books, art, cooking... A lot of things I loved doing, I had replaced by mindless drinking instead. I just want my passion for it all back. 

If you've made it this far, thank you kindly for reading. It's a lot but I will start small from tomorrow, setting up small goals... maybe cook some pasta.

If nothing else, it is a good reminder (for me) to know my limits. Don't go overboard. Don't let it become an every day thing. It's too late to regret it now, but it is not too late to learn from it.

As I sipped it, I reminisced on a week of sobriety. And that week of sobriety is so, so much more powerful than the minor happiness that this drink could bring me.

I could get drunk and let anxiety, depression and panic overwhelm me. I could suffer through the resulting insomnia, the stomachaches and withdrawals and vomiting and tingling and loss of feeling and muscle fatigue. I could go back to literally having panic attacks on the road when I have to go over an overpass (I have a crippling fear of heights and of driving, but when I'm sober, it's not a big deal. When dealing with withdrawals, hooooooly shit it's bad)

Or, I can do what I've done the last week, impress my boyfriend by keeping the apartment clean, noticing little things that I know are pet peeves of his and correcting them, being able to go into the studio today and handle cameras and microphones and hosts and hostesses and conduct interviews with people halfway across the country with a sober mind. I even had a very well-known network broadcast anchor tell me today while I was working with her, ""I was listening to you and your partner talk, and you both have excellent voices, I could totally imagine the two of you on the radio.""

Which is something I have been told before, but definitely not while I was drinking a lot, and definitely not by this well-known news anchor.

I don't know why I decided to have a drink. Oh wait, it's because I'm an alcoholic. Duh.

But, it's interesting. I had one. And I'm fine with that. I don't want any more. I know that's a trap that my brain is laying for me.

But why bother drinking more when I have to be at the studio again in the morning, training to be essentially my boss's right hand man, and (if or when) she leaves, be in a prime spot to take over the studio?

Fuck alcohol, the potential to take over her job is waaaaaaay more enticing.

For myself, I have drank in a way that everyone would call ""alcoholic"" for more than 20 years.

Look at what's happened to me
I can't believe it myself
Suddenly I'm up on top of the world
It should have been somebody else
Believe it or not, I'm walkin' on air
I never thought I could feel so free
Flyin' away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not it's just me
Just like the light of a new day
It hit me from out of the blue
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true

No more and no less. It's not complete sobriety yet, but it makes me believe that sobriety or a break is possible. Don't have the urge to drink more EXCEPT for when me and my boyfriend fight.

Today we argued because we were running late to an appointment our 3 y/o son had. Bf had decided to put off taking a shower until the last minute, and took out the trash etc when we were already late. So he comes out, gets in with us (me and son were waiting in the car), looks at the clock and said there's no way we were gonna make it- and there's no point in trying. 
I asked if I could call and ask if being 5-10 minutes late would be ok. He kept saying there was no point, then starts saying it was all my fault we were running late since he was doing all of the things I should have done this morning. Even though I got our son dressed/fed/out the door while he was still in the shower. I told him he had a quitters mentality and the logical thing to do was just call them and ask if we could be a little late. He thinks I'm wasting time at this point and I'm getting frustrated too. 

So I try calling the place, while the bf keeps talking over our now crying kid. So I told him to shut up and that I couldn't hear what he was saying when he's talking over the crying. He then yells at me to shut up and called me a dumb bitch for the first time in our 5 year relationship!

After that I didn't say anything. I hung up the phone, took our son inside to his room to tried calming down. I was seeing red. Heard boyfriend open the fridge and a bottle of champagne and go to our room closing the door. He was hoping to have a big day of work today but obviously that's fucked now. Later he'll probably say that's my fault too. 

Now I'm in a bad mood, angry that bf gets to hide away and drink while I take care of our son like normal. Part of me just wants to do what my boyfriend is doing- hide away alone with a bottle of champagne and phone and throw the day away. I want to be the bigger person but the anger makes that hard. I haven't drank today and want my son to at least have a good day and turn mine around too. I just can't seem to shake the anger though. 

Overall emotions have been so intense since I dropped heavy drinking  Does anyone else face the same thing? How you guys handle getting rid of the urge to drink when angry? Like the shaking with rage kind of anger? It seems to be my absolute worst, most intense trigger.

Edit: My boyfriend is not a big drinker or anything but does have a pattern of drinking when he gets stressed. Then from there it's a 50/50 chance if he'll be jovial or turn into an asshole when he gets a bottle of wine in him.",8,0

I'm off the straight and narrow and I need to figure out how to get backing into a groove again. 

A few months ago I wound up in the ER from a terrible hangover that had me thinking my heart was skipping beats. That was the biggest reality shock I've had when it came to my drinking. (more so than showing up to work drunk and also having my drinking jeopardize my career and marriage) I went on a 70 day streak, my longest ever and it felt amazing. Then one day I convinced myself that ""one"" wouldn't hurt. Now I can't go more than a day without drinking. I've started stopping at the liquor store on my way home and drinking in my driveway so my wife doesn't know. I figured out all of the hiding places in the house where I can stash my empties and she won't find them.

I have been going to a therapist that has been helping but my insurance only covers 12 sessions per year and I used all of those up in 3 months and now I can't afford the $60 she charges to get help. Nothing I think of is giving me the motivation to quit again. Not my wife, my health, my job, my family, my friends, nothing. I hated AA when I went cause I don't believe in god and they pushed that hard it seemed to me. I feel awful even if I have one beer but that feeling is nothing to the rush I get after that first sip at the end of a long day.

I've tried to read this sub everyday and do the ""one day at a time"" thing and I just can't find myself sticking to it. Are there any resources out there for me? Something like AA where I can talk to real people or have some kind of support group? I'm on my hands and knees here hoping this post reaches the right set of eyes. I can't use my coworkers or my wife as a therapist anyone as I feel like I'm causing more problems than good.",8,0

Last year my 11 yo asked me to stop drinking and instead of listening I dismissed him, my ex ended up taking me to court over it and I agreed to an alcoholic evaluation and to do Sober link level one which is a breathalyzer 24 hours prior too parenting time and every day of parenting time.  The evaluation is purely subjective and I was able to ""pass"" it and have a recommendation of eight hours substance abuse education.  Well, I figured out that the sober link only detects alcohol up to 13 hours after consumption and adjusted what time I tested to allow for me to still drink and not have it show up.  One night though, I went on one hell of a bender, mySO was so pissed he left and stayed at a hotel.  The next day I tested at 9 am and I was .025...my first failed test.  Fast forward a week or so and around 6 pm I realize I forgot to test that day, but I couldn't test then because I had already started drinking.  Next morning I purposely went into work to be able to tell my ex that I couldn't test because I wasnt at home.  A missed test is a failed test.  My ex did a supplemental assessment on me, and while he did lie a bit, he painted a different picture to the evaluator.  So now, I'm doing soberlink level two which is testing every day three times a day with no way to cheat the system. My son means everything to me and I will not compromise my time with him so I am committed to not drinking the next six months and testing everyday.  I admit I didn't like the way my body felt, the bloated face, the digestive issues, the foggy brain.....but the vodka always seemed to win out every night.  Here I am on day 2 and i hope that when these six months are done I continue the sober life because I know i was poisoning myself and it was not sustainable.

My name is Misty. I have worked 911 (als) ambulance for almost 21 years.  Over the last 5 years I started drinking a little at a time. First it was just to help me sleep, then to give me some sort of energy to clean and take care of 5 kids.  Then it was to help me to relax when my husband and I fought constantly and was accused of cheating constantly. Even though I never did. I have been injured several times very badly on 911 calls. I have had multiple surgeries and so forth. Back in the second week of January I contracted covid, and right then and there I gave up alcohol because I was so sick. I remained alcohol free for a few days shy of 3 months. Then due to severe stress I started drinking again. I have stopped drinking several different times since then for 3 to 4 days. Always to start drinking again... I know that I have major ptsd from work due to all the insane traumas ect that I have encountered for sooo long... Have mothers throw their deceased baby into my arms and screaming and crying for me to do something or anything for them, and knowing there was nothing I could do. I have seen things that no human being should ever have to see. I got hurt again on another 911 call on the end of Novenber of 2020. Since I have been off all of this time minus that I quit in January of 2021 for just shy of 3 months, I have been drinking more than ever before.. I am up to drinking over 700 mls of vodka daily... My abdomen is distended, as well as I can feel my liver and pancreas hurt daily... not to mention to what it's doing to my family... I also know that my ptsd is playing a role in my day to day bad mental health. I can't even go into my dr.. to get ptsd help until I can quit drinking. I also can not afford to go to any rehab for 30 days or longer because of my kids. I was using some amazing drops that were truly helping me to quit, and then the fda forced the company to discontinue them... I wake up super sick every morning, trying to get my kids breakfast make their lunches and get them to school. about 1030-1100 every morning I start shaking my heart races and I start sweating and soak anything I am wearing. My girls ask me constantly why I am shaking and it breaks my heart to make up stories to them. I do have a husband who works in the same field I do, but He became a diabetic and he quit alcohol right then and there. He knows I am really struggling however he is a marine and says well if you don't want to drink then dont... he acts like it's no big deal. He may have quit drinking but he put his addiction into video games and locks himself in his game room 24/7 when he is home, and leaves me to deal with everything else. I guess my whole reason to me sending out atleast part of my story is to see if any one here can help me, give me suggestions or anything that has helped with them to detoxs... I am so sorry for such a long post, however I can feel my body dying, and I don't want to die, I can't leave my children, and I have no support or anywhere else I can turn too... The irony is that I have dedicated my entire life to helping any and everyone else, but in retrospect I can't even help myself... I am the one now that needs help, but I don't have it. For those Of you that have read through my whole story I thank you. even if you dont have any advise for me.

Right now I don't have any desire to drink. Now that I can look back I did not enjoy it. I was unhappy. I didn't think it was possible to be happy without drugs or drinking. I didn't think I could ever be happy. I was very unhappy only I didn't know it. 

Today I am completely content with my life. I feel healthier and have accomplished so many goals in such a short time.

I am able to go and see friends and go to get togethers with drinking around me and not drink. I feel liberated completely and now when I see people drink I don't miss it at all. No thank you to being completely hung over and wasting a day.

I am on my day three of no drinking, and I'm, naturally scared and unsure of what lies ahead of me.

I am a co-owner of a pub, and my spree of drinking spanned two, if not three years. 

Sometimes it was just a few beers, sometimes I'd get very drunk, but - I was drinking every day. Part of the job, I used to say.

However, during that period my anxiety and depression became somewhat severe and I was arguing with and fighting many people, including my partner. Sometimes I'd feel incredibly brave, motivated and such, and other times I'd just drop into the pits of depression, almost on the verge of suicide, because ""nothing matters"". I have more money than I need and still - I'd feel absolutely nothing. I'd leave enourmous tips for everyone because nothing mattered to me.

This is not who I am. This is not who I used to be. 

Three days ago I got very drunk and came home at 10am. During that time I was saying my own personal secrets and I was so stupidly depressing that I disgusted myself once I woke up. This is when I said: ""No more.""

And here I am, three days later.

Your posts have been incredibly helpful, but I'm still afraid of the road that lies ahead. Especially because of my work.

We have live music often, and I work the second shift often as well and I'd spend all of them drinking, whether I was working or just being there to see everything is in order.

This is all I know. 

I'm an outgoing person, I dislike the idea of spending my evenings home, watching Netflix or playing games. So is it possible to even have fun at live events just chugging sodas and energy drinks? 

Rock'n'roll and metal music, which is a MASSIVE part of my life, are surrounded by, at the very least, beer. Not to mention other liqours.

It's impossible for me to imagine going to a rock show and just chug sodas. Any advice?",23,0

I didn't deserve what happened to me, yet part of me is punishing myself for what did happen; that's pretty common among children who suffer systematic trauma and don't have it soothed by parental figures.   


All this trauma is still informing my decisions into my 40s. I never drink on consecutive days (I simply cannot stand to look at or god forbid smell alcohol the next day), but that isn't the point. I'm scared a lot. I'm taking medications (and deliberately not taking Xanax when I drink; interesting that I don't have a medication-abuse problem. Probably because if I did the medications would run out and I'd require an Rx, whereas alcohol is just a trip to the store) that would work a lot better if I stopped drinking.   


I hate that it's one day at a time. I know it MUST be one day at a time, and I've spent months trying to accept this. I see people post who have 6 months or 5 years or whatever under their belts and I'm like I WANT THAT and at the same time I find myself very resentful (this is no offense to anyone who has such milestones; this is about me, not you) because I don't think I'll ever get there.   


My brain, body, and LIFE need me to stop. So today I'm hydrating just as much as yesterday, and I'm going to fix myself the heart-body-mind healthy food I'd been eating before I bought the junk food: salmon and whole grain rice, or steamed veggies with kidney beans, that type of thing.   


I want to feel good again. There was a time not hugely long ago when I didn't drink. I didn't get drunk until I was 27. Ever since I moved to my current place before the 2016 elections I've been medicating more due to politics, but now I'm not looking forward to having to isolate again due to COVID. I'm vaccinated, I take ample mask precautions. But I want to LOVE MYSELF. I want to believe I'm worth LOVE.   


I'm working with my therapist on this; we created a list of positive traits I can read in the mirror. I've done that a few times but need to do it more. (Note: this was inspired by a stopdrinking user whose name I can't remember, but thank you soooo much for it).   


Ok I'm going to need to cry now. Maybe I'll do it in the mirror. I have therapy tomorrow and I feel terrible, so I'm not drinking tonight.   


Thanks for reading. I don't really want advice. I just want people who get it to hear me.",13,2

I decided to take a new road. I don't even remember how I got to this site, or heard about ""QuitLit"" books like This Naked Mind, I just know that after 40+ years of drinking, I was either going to end up dead, in jail, alone, or homeless if I didn't make some changes.

I don't post a lot here, but I read your stories and see so much of myself in you and your struggles. Those that touch me the most are the ones who don't believe they can ever change, and come here in need of words of encouragement. You've had it and you're never going to drink again, but a few hours later, you're drunk and you think you're a lost cause. I'm here to tell you, you're not a lost cause and you can win.

I was like that too. I quit so many times, I told myself so many lies. I had so many workarounds and  creative ways of counting drinks to make it sound like less. The sneaking, the planning... it was exhausting!

Worst of all was the deep down feeling that I would always be that way. My family was drunks, my first wife was a drunk, my friends were drunks, and I outdrank them all. Until one year ago, when I saved my own life.

How you choose to do it isn't as important as just doing it. I know what worked for me was educating myself by reading, and avoiding the killer boredom by doing anything other than drinking. Eating, sleeping, watching movies, exercising, reading some more. The boredom almost won at first, but that gets better within a couple months. It made me realize one of the reasons I drank, and those kinds of realizations teach you about yourself and the world. You become stronger and smarter and you understand the complex evil of the alcohol industry.

Tl;dr: If I did it, you can too!!

However, I'm going through some life changes at the moment - soon to move house, get married and try for a baby. This is very exciting and I'm thrilled but I am seeing the effects of my changes socially already. 

For years I've been in a social group of largely single, 30-50 year olds who are local . Already from being in a relationship my place within this group had naturally shifted - less available for spontaneous drinks/adventures etc. Not drinking has added an extra level of distance socially, and couple with upcoming move and potential baby I'm feeling this group soon won't be mine at all and I'm starting to mourn it a bit. 

The upshot is that I've started to blame not drinking a bit - after all, moving forward in my life is normal and good but if I could just get drunk and silly with them again I'd still have that last fun connection.

To be clear, my alcohol use disorder comes in the form of binge drinking on the weekends and will occasionally drink during the week but not as much. I went on a trip with my fianc√© and his family to an area where the local beer is well known. The first night out to eat, everyone drank so I snuck in my NA IPA and ordered water and a ginger ale. The night was great, I noticed I was still funny and social without the booze. I woke up the next day feeling proud of myself. The next night out to eat I ordered an IPA. Why? I drank 2 beers and I was able to stop. I felt okay with this although I was not happy. Last night, we went out to eat and again I ordered 2 beers. When we got home I drank 2 more. Those 2 extra beers got me craving a former addiction of mine, cigarettes, so I smoked 2 of those. I haven‚Äôt smoked a cigarette in a while, wtf?! Although I only had 4 beers over the span of 3-4 hours, I was able to stay ‚Äúin control‚Äù but still that was not my goal. I felt GOOD not drinking in the first place, why did I choose to give in?

It's hard to think how deep I got myself into (hiding alcohol in all my drawers, sneaking white claws from the fridge to my room, drinking vodka bottles and buying more vodka to fill the bottle up with). I was at heaviest in my life, 210-215 lbs, dragging my feet with the last few classes I needed to graduate, and in a relationship I didn't really want to be in. August 2019 - went to the ER with kidney stones and found I had elevated liver enzymes. I knew alcohol was effecting my health.... everyone knows how going to the bathroom is when you're an alcoholic..... Well quitting drinking caused my ex boyfriend to dump me after 2 years (blessing in disguise)

Here I am almost 7 months later, fifty pounds lighter, and a college graduate. I recently got flown out, across the country, for a once in a lifetime job opportunity where I actually might get the job?

The drugs and alcohol were like a soft-focus lens that allowed me to live with the harsh reality of my upbringing, endure abuse from my own mother, men, and ""friends"", and continue living the lie that my family forced on me as the family scapegoat. Through therapy, I have realized that my mom had Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and for many years into my adulthood, gave me pills that kept me dependent on her and made me sick. Realizing this has been horrifying. I had to cut ties with her and my entire family who've enabled her because ""she just loves you so much, you're her little baby"" (I'm 39).

I hate AA. I hate the emphasis on ""that sounds like a YOU problem"" and ""it's not always ABOUT YOU"". This is word for word what my mom always said to me when I told her I needed help when it didn't benefit her (she was only ever interested in being the martyr/""perfect angel mother"" when other people were around to see it, otherwise my medical needs went untreated), or expressed even the slightest bit of desire for independence from her. To an abused or neglected person who has tried to get help and always heard that it's selfish to assert even the most basic of needs, ""it's not always about you"" is very triggering. Please don't tell me ""just find another meeting"". I hate the crusty old white macho man culture of AA and support groups in general, and there is only one meeting in the country where I live. I do not care to check out women's groups because the problem is in the texts, the framing; it's embedded in the philosophy of the program itself. Using Zoom makes me feel more alone.

I stopped drinking and doing drugs and that was just the beginning. I went back to therapy and while it's been helpful for me to identify abusive patterns with partners/ex-husbands and ""friends"", and to see my family for what it is, I don't have any support outside of it. Almost all of my relationships were abusive or codependent. The few people I decided I wanted to hang onto through sobriety and empowerment/lucidity in therapy were the same few who decided they didn't want to be a friend to someone who suddenly had boundaries or standards.

I have no job. I am living off the last of my savings. When I run out of money, I will have no family, no friend, no nothing to catch me. I honestly wish I could go back in time and stick with the plan, the occasional merriment, the shitty ups and downs of being in a relationship with alcohol and other people. This sterile aloneness, this overly therapeutized, scapegoated new me, this aging loser, this isolated freak: I hate it. At least the old me was fun and flirty and open. So what if guys who were into me were assholes? I've done both and I have to say: being with them was better than being alone. ""I'd rather be alone and meditate and cook!"" was cool for the first 3 - 6 months of sobriety, but now seeing that it's going to be the rest of my life, it fucking sucks.",23,0

I became concerned when the opposite happened.  Then I realized that the world my kids were growing up in was so much more booze soaked than the world I grew up in.  Between their adult role models and societal messaging, alcohol must seem like the most amazing thing in the world.  Given my own struggles despite a booze free childhood, that wasn't going to end up well for them.  I decided to quit both for my health and theirs.  Countless day 1's.  I got so down on myself.  Why couldn't I just stop!   It was not until I found this community that things changed.  I got smarter about alcohol and what was going on.  ""Naked Mind"" was a good resource.  Alcohol was not my fun friend I liked to hang out with and relax with at HH, it was highly addictive poison and it was ruining my life.  I kept unsuccessfully trying to quit, but I was learning what worked for me in all of those failures even as I got more depressed and frustrated.  I came to this community daily both to learn and to give and receive encouragement.  

One year ago today when I sat down to write ""I'm quitting"" for the umpteenth time in my journal it felt different.  I was determined in a way I never had been and also prepared thanks to all those failed day 1's.  It was me or the booze this time and I was all in.  It was really hard, but now here I am one year later and I am proud of myself and happy with the life I am building alcohol free.  It is MUCH easier now.    

For those of you lurking and wondering if you have a problem, you do.  Trust me you do and recognition is the first essential step.  Don't be fooled into focusing on what you are giving up, the important things are what you are gaining.  Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - an alcoholic gives up all of those things for a buzz, a beat up body, depleted bank account, broken family, and an awful hangover.  Makes no sense, and the further into sobriety I get the more ridiculous it all seems.  For those in the fight, the struggle is worth it.  Celebrate every little win along the way and when you fail blame alcohol not yourself.  Learn to hate alcohol, not love it, and if you really think about it there is so much to hate about booze.  So long as you don't give up on yourself you can do it.  IWNDWYT",58,0

Instead of thinking about my vices as problems to be solved, I began looking at them as symptoms of something deeper. 

It also made me more curious about my mental well-being. Because of this, last week I found out how much I have normalized my issues. I then decided to reach out to a psychiatrist, for guidance. Today I had my first visit and I was prescribed a treatment for depression.

This shift in perspective would be the biggest change I felt so far. I am still feeling down on most days, and I am fully reaping what I sowed during all those years of self-medication.

The Friday before last. I had been isolated for a while and honestly, I just didn't want to feel anything for one evening. Hoo boy, did I make up for that luxury the next morning - that lack of feeling - by feeling like I'd been run over by a fucking truck. I was horrifically ill and alone.

And I recovered like you'd expect, physically, but mentally this one relapse has really taken a toll on me. I've suffered from severe anxiety ever since. My boyfriend's absense makes me feel more vulnerable. I struggle to trust that I'll have my best interests at heart when I'm alone. And why wouldn't I struggle with that? Look at what I've just done.

But then, also... Look at what I've just done:

- started off 315lbs in March 2020, currently 228lbs
- dropped out of university in June 2018 due to suicidal ideation and alcoholism, now over two years into a part-time engineering degree with amazing grades
- achieved many months of sobriety (all strung together with failures to moderate)
- ended a very toxic relationship early last year, and now approaching the first anniversary of a wholesome and supportive one

I remember after dropping out of university, waking up hungover one morning and realising that it would be difficult for me to find alcohol to continue drinking. I was terrified. I was terrified of getting sober and having to face the world uninhibited. I couldn't look other people in the eye. I felt like I couldn't breathe.

But I'm here now. I'm not managing perfectly, and although it absolutely feels like that's not okay, I know it is. I'm under no obligation from anyone to be perfect. I just need to try to be better.

I don't know how to handle this situation and I am truly desperate. I am thankful for everyone who reads this and does not judge me. 

For me going out with friends is either going home at 11 being slightly tipsy or not drinking at all or it is a evening with way too much alcohol and me missing some parts.
 
Last Saturday, I was out with friends after more than a year. I had some really good conversations with old friends and in general it was a great evening, until it wasn't and that's when it went from tipsy to full oversharing to crying. I can't remember the last hour of this night, but I can remember that I cried because I hate myself and my dating life is a disaster.

 When I am drunk I am afraid of someone taking advantage of me or doing anything slightly sexual (there was sexual abuse in my childhood). Since I do not live in my hometown I needed a place to sleep and asked one of my friends which said yes. Unfortunately, the person left when their taxi arrived and they did not wait for me (they told me the next day). I then had to stay at another friend's home, which made me a little bit uncomfortable as I was in a bad state. A few things I can remember is that I told him and his gf (which wasn't at the party but at home - so a full stranger) what happened to me as a child, the things that were wrong in my family. They were both fully understanding, offered me help if I ever needed to talk and there was nothing wrong with me talking about it.

Because I am missing some parts of the evening, the next day I asked my friends if everything was okay. And everyone reassured me that everything was fine. But for me it isn't fine. I fill blank spaces with situations in which I act horribly or do stuff which gets me straight to jail, although I was with my friends all the time. My mind is constantly telling me that everyone knows about my childhood trauma, when I only told my friend and his gf. I feel so ashamed for drinking so much and being a total mess. I am ashamed that I drove with a friend of mine, who definitely was not allowed to drive a car at this moment. I am ashamed that I didn't stop him from doing it because I myself was way to wasted. I am ashamed for being a total wreck. 

I know that I need to stop drinking. I can't further justify it with being in college and young. I can't further justify my drinking by having people around me, who also blackout at a certain time of the evening. I know this.

It is the third day of me not being able to eat, get up, shower or do anything. I am panicking. I had clinical depression last year, I am better now but still in therapy. I was alright until this saturday, where I thought I was able to ""moderate"". I judge myself so hard and I am afraid of telling my therapist about this evening. I don't want to bother my friends anymore. I want to be better, but there is such a massive guilt and shame above my head, I am constantly telling myself what a horrible failure I am. 

So my question is. How do you forgive yourself? How do you get out of this guilt, shame and anxiety? How do I move forward? What if this was the final evening from which I can never mentally recover?

A relapse is a relapse of course but mitigating the damage is somewhat helpful and info on how to do so would have been immensely useful at that time.

So I guess this post is to ask anyone‚Äôs experience and advice on calling it quits before you end up in a detox or blacked out, etc. 

For me, I was able to stop by reading essays and articles about recovery and listening to some music I love, but any other tips would be helpful to put in my pocket and hopefully help others. I hope if someone has the wherewithal to search for solutions to stop the slide they can at least find some info or words of encouragement.

I had tons of fun, I didn‚Äôt have to work for 9 months, I got to spend tons of time with friends and family, but I turned into a person I didn‚Äôt recognize. I was angry all the time. I‚Äôd pick fights then cry myself to sleep on a regular basis. I gained an insane amount of weight. Drinking became my main priority and what I planned my days around.

That continued on and off for months. Sure I‚Äôd take a week off, but I gave in every time. I felt great when I was sober for 2 months and I so wanted to get to that point again, but I didn‚Äôt. No particular reason why. A drink just always sounds nice and I always tell myself ‚Äúonce a week is ok‚Äù. It never stops at once a week. About 1.5 months ago I wanted to get serious about it again. I almost made it 3 weeks, but I then I drank. I‚Äôve been drinking since.

Not sure where I‚Äôm going with this rant. I just know I want it to stick this time and I want to be free of this. I like who I am when I‚Äôm sober. I like how I look when I‚Äôm sober. I accomplish more when I‚Äôm sober. So yeah, that‚Äôs it. I didn‚Äôt drink today and this time I‚Äôm going to give it all I‚Äôve got.

Now 3 years later we have a daughter, I am not drinking, not riding the anxiety wave, and all my friends and loved ones know that. I even got some alcohol free beer as a gift and special ordered some hop tea :) excited for 33!

It's been rough, between that and the detoxing, although I think I might finally be over the hump. At least I'm not mad at everything anymore. I'm trying to quit smoking and drinking at the same time, that's a blast, I tells ya.

I tested myself tonight by going to one of my usual haunts, but you know what? It was actually easier than I thought to say no, and a Shirley Temple (hey, its a tasty mocktail) cut down the compulsion that normally gin or whiskey solve. So I'm proud of myself for this much, at least.

I can't say I'm sleeping better, due to other reasons, but my head is clearer, I'm waking up easier, I have more energy, I'm not tired all the time. I'm joining a gym Wednesday. Holy cow I still have money after the weekend. What the hell have I been doing all this time? Not sure where the road leads, but at least I feel like I have some kinda direction. I hope I can fix what I screwed up last weekend, but I won't let it define me going forward. I'm going to continue doing better. I will be better.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Tuesday morning / evening, SD! I‚Äôm getting the DCI up early today because I‚Äôm on my way to a doctor‚Äôs appointment to ask for help with my depression, something I have been putting off for far too long. Despite all the times I‚Äôve advised friends and family to see a doctor or seek help in various forms, I am absolutely terrible at taking my own advice. I will put it off and do absolutely anything else to avoid asking for -- or even accepting -- help. 

&#x200B;

I was like this in my drinking as well. I was high-functioning and my drinking never resulted in an external consequence that was bad enough for someone to force me to stop. So, I struggled in silence and isolation, banging my head against all kinds of other ways to bring ‚Äúwellness‚Äù and ‚Äúbalance‚Äù into my life, without facing the obvious truth that I wanted to stop drinking, I didn‚Äôt know how to do it, and I needed help. 

&#x200B;

This is something I‚Äôm actively working on now: to move past my fear, to set aside my pride, to get out of my self-centered thinking, and to ask for and accept help. One of the small steps I‚Äôm taking is to be aware of the ways that help appears, or is offered to me. It could be a friend showing up at my house with cupcakes, a colleague offering to assist with a difficult project, a kind word from an acquaintance, or even hearing just the right words in a podcast when I need encouragement. I think of them as little gifts, and they appear more frequently than I had thought! Even better, sometimes WE are the gift to someone else and we might not even know it. 

&#x200B;

So I share this with you today with the hope that if you need it, that you can find the strength and courage to ask for help, or to receive it, in whatever form it appears. And no matter what, IWNDWYT.",289,0

Four days ago, I hit the 6 month sober mark. I'm not one to quote models, but Naomi Campbell was on target when she said simply, ""Not drinking makes me a lot happier."" I feel more like a kid again, lighter, and more like myself.  

Quitting alcohol has brought numerous positives to my life. I've lost weight (20lbs) and gained mental clarity and stability. I have better skin, deeper sleep and improved digestion. With stronger boundaries, I engage in less self-loathing, and have an improved my connection with my husband.

I'm 38 and for most of my adult life, I drank every day. I drank to numb discomfort and it stunted my emotional growth - making me distant, shrunken, distorted, weak, alone. In February, after an especially bad blackout and tantrum, I made the change. 

I have work to do on myself and relationships to strengthen. I started running to get out stress and joined a hiking club. I read more, and nurture my curiosity. ¬†I will continue to uncover and work through the things I buried with alcohol. 

It may be cheesy, but I think going into the AF journey with as much positivity and focus as possible will help you get to the other end.

But recently, it's gotten worse. Anyway, that car trouble from this past Saturday that triggered me to drink occurred again tonight. I was out, walking around my small town playing Pokemon Go, when my dad texted me about car problems. I told him to let me know if I needed to get him. Kept walking around, distracting myself and getting some much-needed exercise (that's for another post). 

Finally, he gave up on it, got it to slowly crawl somewhere safe out of traffic, and called me. I was already back home because I had a feeling he'd need my help. So sure enough, there's the call. And I could confidently hop in the car and go get him.

There's three people in this house. We're now down to 2 working vehicles, and one may not hold up much longer. Money is a HUUUUGE stressor for my family, and therefore, myself.

Anyway, the reason I'm posting this is because I need to talk to people. I almost drank earlier today, and had the intent to do so. But I journaled and posted/commented here, went for a couple walks, and because of that, I could help my dad. 

I post here because I don't have a therapist yet, and my friends are either asleep like normal people or they don't get it. But you all do.

This goes for both my relationship with alcohol as well as a toxic relationship I had with an ex.  I had a bad heart break earlier this year and haven't spoken to him in 7 months. I randomly decided to reach out to him - to make peace, break the ice, etc. But now I feel bad about myself, regret reaching out and am playing out the history all over again.

The same goes for alcohol. I romanticize the fun times I had but truly it was a toxic relationship and **took from me way more than it gave**. 

On the plus side, I do not feel like drinking. But why does my mind want to go back to what wasn't good for me?

My life is so different than one year ago. Well, I guess the whole world is different. But for me personally so many things are finally going in the right direction. I doubled my pay, found a new career and a company that I love, and am so much closer to my wife and children than ever before. 

No more stomach issues. No hangovers in the morning. No regrets for whatever stupid or overly emotional thing I said or did the night before. No arguments! No 3AM fast food runs for 2500 calories of grease. Over $5,000 post-tax money saved.

For now I‚Äôm just questioning what happens when I continue with sobriety long enough and feel like I can moderate in the future. What if I learn to do that and learned from my mistakes?

Additionally, he‚Äôs very supportive of my sobriety, never judges me for my past mistakes, and is very empathetic and emotionally supportive when I‚Äôm feeling guilt, shame, or just generally upset about my past struggles with alcohol. 

The not-so-great aspect is that every once in a while I feel this crushing feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough for him, I don‚Äôt deserve him‚Äù because he is such a sweet angel and I somehow feel like my past makes me unworthy of someone so amazing. I know he doesn‚Äôt care about my past but I‚Äôve been a bad girlfriend to my exes: cheated, lied, spent nights out getting fucked up and not coming home, slept around, etc all partly due to my alcohol abuse.

I took a break from drinking last month after a really bad day (drank 4 pints and 6 shots of whiskey along with a pot of coffee or so over the course of the day) that ended up turning into a panic attack that was so bad I thought it was a heart attack. 

It's been stressful as fuck. I'm managing there are times when I just want bourbon or a good beer and it's... hard. I run a small business and am raising a 2 year old and even finding time to go to a Smart Recovery meeting or hang out IRL with friends is like an Olympic-level task.

Realizing that I have terrible impulse control with alcohol and that I can't drink again until I can control it. I love the fuck out of ice cream but I don't run for second or third helpings after I have some. I like coffee but I'm not going to drink shot after shot of espresso. I like watching bad sci-fi movies but after watching one I wanna do something around the house, not do a marathon.

But something's broken with my impulse control with alcohol. If I have a beer I need another beer and another beer with it, whether I'm with myself or hanging out with friends or with my family. That's a really bad situation and honestly has a whole fucking lot with how I'm 300 lbs now. Did lose 6 pounds so far this month from not drinking though, so that's good.

But I'm currently on holiday with my family - the first booze free family holiday.

I want to reassure anybody worrying that holidays will be dull or boring that that's not the case at all.

We're only staying with family quite close to home, but we've had such a wonderful day today. We went to a beach town my wife and I used to go to as kids, taking our own children there for the first time.

I don't even know where to start with all the moments I'll remember forever:

\- Starting the day early and fresh, getting to our destination *before we planned to (not late and hungover!)* \- and getting all that extra family time.

\- Feeling like a kid on fairground rides, rather than an overweight middle aged guy who can't deal with spinny things when hungover.

\- Being SO present with the children, who rewarded our positive vibes with impeccable behaviour. We had five extremely happy and excited young children between three adults, and there was no stress and no need for a single telling off!

\- Drinking iced lattes instead of beers, and not having to keep stopping to use toilets!

\- Everybody telling me how well / slim I looked.

\- Lying in bed with my wife afterwards chatting, remembering EVERY funny and special moment, and all the witty things our friends and family said.

\- Losing count of all the unprompted ""I love yous"" and ""you're the bests"" from my children.

\- Having massive guilt free burgers delivered afterwards, knowing that I'd not spent all day consuming empty calories.

\- Lying in bed typing this knowing I will wake up hangover free again tomorrow.

I was never somebody who would have *spoiled* a day like today by being smashed. But there could well have been a hangover, a late arrival, a trip to a pub that we painted as fun for the kids but was really so we could have one or two to ""take the edge off.""

This was SO much better. And I could have made the above list many times longer.

I made my way through the mountain of paperwork and got admitted into my first choice program in April, ranked #4 out of 160 accepted students. I had my first fundamentals of nursing class this morning and I cried big sloppy tears both to and from the campus. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever been so happy, so content, so damn optimistic. The feeling is approximately 10,000 times better than alcohol EVER made me feel. THIS is the feeling I want to chase for the rest of my life, not alcohol-induced oblivion. 

839 days from that first day of sobriety to the first day of the rest of my life. It is both the longest and shortest time period of my life, and it was worth every painful moment. 

I‚Äôm going to be a nurse, and it‚Äôs all thanks to sobriety. Stay the course, my sober friends. I promise, the rewards are more than worth the effort. Peace.

I read an interview with Katie Crutchfield in Billboard magazine where she talks about getting sober and going through recovery, it seems to be a theme that runs throughout this record.  

Do you have any songs dealing with recovery that move you?  Maybe if we get a few we can put together a nice little mix.

My gut bacteria is all out of whack as a result of abusing alcohol for so long and has caused horrible physical and mental ailments. 

Abstinence from alcohol, strong probiotics, digestive enzymes, and clean eating are shining a little light at the end of my tunnel. It‚Äôs giving me hope. 

33 days without a drop and I feel a smidgen better everyday. Perhaps a new theory of why alcohol wrecks your brain and mentality so much is because what it is doing to your gut microbiome and digestion?? A lot of scientists are now calling the gut your second brain. Could I be on to something?

6 years ago today was the worst day of my life, and it was the best day of my life. I feel like us kinds of people know that feeling very well.

My drinking had led me to some dark places, and eventually it let to other substance abuse issues. I ended up getting rid of those after a couple of years and thought I'd be okay if I just drank and smoked a little pot.

Well, that turned into a DUI. A few months after that I fell while drunk and injured myself in a not serious but pretty obvious way. Then a few months later I got into an argument with my then girlfriend. Of course I was drunk. I remember very little about why we argued but I do remember some of it had to do with drinking. I also remember threatening to commit suicide, though of course I was too chicken to do it.

The next day she seemed oddly at ease, and we talked a lot. I promised her I'd quit drinking for good and she asked if I was going to an AA meeting. I told her I would. That evening I went to a meeting and it was the first time I'd been to a meeting sober. I introduced myself by saying ""My name is _____ and I'm an alcoholic"". It felt strange to say that. It wasn't a memorable meeting by any means.

When I got home I saw a note on the door that read - ""I'm sorry, I can't do this""

I walk in to our apartment and notice almost everything that belonged to my then girlfriend was gone. Gone in only 2 and a half hours.

This was a girl that I had been with for 6 years. We were talking about getting married. I bought the ring she wanted. All gone, just like all the empty beer cans.

I remember howling. I remember crying on the floor. I remember thinking there's no way I could go on living like this. I called her several times, no answer. I get a text message later that night that says ""I'm safe, please do not contact me anymore""

We reconnected some time later so she could pick up the rest of her stuff. She told me ""If you get one year with being free of alcohol we can discuss possibly dating again.""

It worked, we started talking more frequently, dating, and even resumed some talks about getting married, but we never lived together again. Eventually we went our separate ways. 

Since then I've had 2 big career changes, and met a woman who also does not drink. We got married this past May.

I was told when I first sobered up that as long as I followed some direction I would have a life beyond my wildest dreams. I thought that was bullshit because I had some wild dreams. But today, I can say I have that life, because in my wildest dreams I never thought I'd be happy with being myself.

If a dummy like me can do it, you can too.

I am on Day 2. My boyfriend and I had another loud fight after binge drinking. It happens often these days when we drink. We both had VERY rough pasts and drink to numb the pain I guess. I've been binge drinking for about 20 years now. It seemed to have gotten a lot worse since y husband committed suicide in our home, in march 2019. Before that time, my kids didnt really see me drunk.. sloppy... crying. BUt after that, all hell broke loose. It got better then worse then better and now we are back at worse. My kids hate that I drink and want me to stop. Before they never really noticed, because I wasnt a mess. 

After our fight on Saturday, my BFs daughter called her mom crying because she was scared because we were fighting. So now her mom is involved. I wish I could explain to people my reasons for drinking. Not that its OK but just so people could understand me a little better. I made a fool of myself in front of friends and my kids (AGAIN). 

My question to yall is, will the kids and friends eventually forget? Or forgive? I have vowed from that moment on, that neither of us will touch a drop again. We can't moderate and enough is enough. I tend to be an angry or emotional drunk and I get blackout and don't remember.. and the next morning is torture. :-/

Right now, I just want to go into hiding for a month or two.. So this all calms down. Is that normal? Do yall withdraw and go into hiding? I dont want to see friends or go out or do anything.

I like SMART recovery but the meeting I attended was one of the only ones in my city and was not facilitated well, people would go on tangents talking about non recovery related stuff and some would be visibly drunk or under the influence.

I tried lifering and had a bad experience there too. It was just me and 6 older men and it was awkward because I am a young woman and they kept apologising saying usually there‚Äôs more of a mix. The 6 men spent the meeting lamenting the loss of alcohol in their lives and I drank straight after. 

I desperately need support and I just want to find what works and somewhere I can fit in, because I can‚Äôt get sober alone. I‚Äôve tried, and I just can‚Äôt.

I'm mostly a lurker. I'd been drinking about 6-pack/day since April 2020 shortly after the pandemic started, after having over 2 years sobriety prior to that. It finally got to the point last week where after a bender Wednesday, I woke up Thursday feeling like absolute garbage, shaking, unable to consume anything other than water, and dry heaving, occasionally with blood coming up. Also fell down my stairs so I have huge bruises and scabbing on my left arm and hip. Called in sick, then again on Friday when I wasn't feeling any better. Friday night I struggled to sleep (had not drank since Wednesday night), and was sweating and hearing voices and crashing sounds, and seeing things moving on the walls that weren't there. That scared the shit out of me , so the next morning I went to urgent care and told them I'd been drinking heavily for a long time and was experiencing withdrawals. They gave me a saline IV and something to calm the anxiety, and did an EKG to make sure my racing heart and chest pain weren't something cardiac related. Then they inexplicably transported me to another hospital via ambulance, where their ER did more of the same (EKG, etc.), then sent me home with some valium after the doctor had determined my withdrawals weren't likely to be fatal. So that was my weekend.

Today I feel mostly better, valium has helped with the anxiety, and I haven't drank since last Wednesday. I'm not looking forward to the upcoming medical bills. I'm looking into joining an IOP (again), and going back to SMART meetings, and seeing a new therapist since I recently moved too  far away to see my old one. 

I only post this drunkalogue so that those of you who may be on the fence about quitting, this is where you can end up (or worse). At least I'm alive, and IWNDWYT.

But I realize I am triggered. I get tempted and I drink with him (like 10-15 drinks a week). BUT It makes my body feel like shit. I honestly think I‚Äôm a little allergic. An old eating disorder also gets triggered when I eat late night crappy food.  Such a cycle!! 

I need a big break from it!  I want him to stop with me for a while, but don‚Äôt want to demand he changes. Thoughts to frame the conversation?",4,0

 I'm in a cornhole league that's held at a brewery, normally I have a couple drinks there, head to a bar afterwards and continue to drink. This time though I held strong and just had water. I'll be honest, I came real close to caving,  it was tough but I'm proud I didn't cave. Normally, when I'm not playing, I wonder around and chat with a bunch of people but the other night. I just sat by my team and chilled. I was a bit bummed that I wasn't so social but overall I felt fine, felt pretty good. 

However, I had a couple people ask me if I was ok. You're not drinking?  Did I miss something? What's wrong? Like shit, chill out, I'm having water tonight. But I guess  for everyone that knows me, I never do that. I never NOT drink. So I can see  why they would have thought something is wrong. Which I guess technically yes, something is wrong. I drink too much. But damn, that hurt a  bit.

Thankfully, there's only one week left, don't know how many more weeks I could have gone and not caved. Got invited to go to another brewery yesterday, said I would pass.  Didn't want to tempt it.

I have read this naked mind by Annie grace and listened to her podcasts. And what a revelation!
 I no longer blame myself, because I now realise I didnt have a choice and my brain was rewired to behave like it was. That helped me a lot. The shame and blame was definitely a trigger and a vicious cycle of shameful behaviour and feelings. Leading to more drinking..... 

I have also come to terms with what I did and what I've lost. moving forward is easier.  Even enjoyable. I could of gone off a cliff and thought ""fuck it! I'm done!"" 
But I'm getting back to my old self. I'm more motivated. I've joined a gym, met new people and made connections. 
We made it official today when I went to her house to sign some documents to remove me from the rental agreement. I thought it would be heartbreaking, but it wasn't. I know what I put her through, and I know what my drinking has cost me.  Now I've just got to get on with my life and move forward. Without her but also without the poison that soured everything I held dear.

I couldn't live the way I had been living anymore. It was either drink or die. I chose to live and go back to my home group/sponsor for help. Working the program for real has helped tremendously. At 4 months my mom was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. Being sober has helped me be there for her and to be a better mom to my 14 year old son. Life doesn't get less ""lifey"" but I have tools to help now and to feel my feelings rather than avoiding them with the drink. 
I won't say it's easy. I still think/dream about drinking. I still wish I could drink like a normal person. But I never drank like a normal person. I drank to feel the effects and gain confidence, happiness, for ""fun"" - until it wasn't. It was just me and the booze too ashamed to leave the house. I couldn't go out in public and drink the way I wanted to. Friends learned long ago that they couldn't take me with them for drinks because I would end up the drunkest the fastest.

I've been an alcoholic for more than 20 years, with numerous small breaks of sobriety throughout. I woke up last Monday and decided it was time to put an end to it once and for all. The first day was really rough, complete with shakes, dry heaves, and extreme paranoia/panic attacks. Day two was a little bit better, but my nights were still spent with little sleep and lots of times waking up soaked in sweat to the point of having to change my shirt in the middle of the night. 

&#x200B;

Things DID improve, though. This morning, I actually woke up dry and feeling fully rested. I know from experience that it's still going to take a while to rewire my brain to a new sober life, but I also know how much better I will feel once I make it to the other side. I'm done trying to convince myself I can moderate or that I will ever be able to allow myself a ""cheat day"". That may work for some people, but for me it's just another trap door to get caught in.

Am a little over 100 days right now. Last time I decided to quit I went to my one and only AA meeting a few days later, it was men only, not sure if that's relevant. 

Did not really have any rock bottom event any time recently and that seemed to be called into question during the meeting. They asked why I was there and I was like ‚Äúbecause I drink way too much and way too often‚Äù and that seemed unacceptable to them and they started talking about probably the most fucked up things that ever happened to them which made them join AA. 


One dude asked what I drink and I said mostly beer but recently switched to seltzers because I was getting chubby (which led me to drinking a lot more because they go down so easy and did NOT help me lose weight at all) and the dudes there were laughing/scoffing about the seltzers, as if to say ‚Äúalcoholics drink straight gin, not seltzer‚Äù 


Some dude there said something funny and I laughed and was told ‚Äúwe‚Äôre laughing now, but none of us were laughing on our first day here‚Äù as if I should be in a state of shame and regret. 


One of the dudes was discussing open VS closed meetings and said ‚Äúclosed is for alcoholics‚Ä¶ or people who THINK they‚Äôre alcoholics‚Äù which was clearly directed toward me. 


They also seemed surprised that I have a family, job, house etc‚Ä¶ 


All in all it was very clear that these guys did not think I‚Äôm a hardcore enough drinker to be in the club. There were some other things too, but don‚Äôt remember it all.  Despite that: they were very nice, they had some book reading they were doing and changed the format of the meeting since it was my first one.  


So I did not really like the AA meeting at all, however it was actually helpful as when I left I was like ‚Äúhmm, I guess I‚Äôm not that fucked up after all. Not drinking should be no sweat‚Äù 


And off topic but the leader or whatever was telling some story about some guy who used to come to meetings and would have a water bottle full of gin or vodka and they all thought that was hilarious. I thought that was funny too, but was surprised that it was not more frowned upon. That didn‚Äôt really affect my impression like the other things above, but I thought it was weird.",103,0

A few months ago, I decided to get in shape and give myself a real chance to stop drinking. I was thinking that if I was paying attention to what I eat and do some sport, it would encourage me to keep on with sobriety. And it's true for the most part, it does help. But lately I've been succumbing to thoughts like ""well, you're doing exercise, it will compensate for the drinks you'll be having tonight"", ""the next run will erase those few beers"" or  ""hey, you're not running tomorrow so you don't have to wake up early, you can have a few drinks"".

So instead of getting better while being sober, my mind has learned a way to keep drinking without missing my running sessions so it looks like there's no harm done. I thought sport would be the solution, but it turns out that it's only a fraction of the solution. I still need the strength to look into myself and accept that I can't drink moderately. I know that from the start, I just need to stop tricking myself into thinking I can fit alcohol in my life without destroying myself.

I am Fabrizio, an Italian guy currently working in Germany. I have travelled across Europe for work, and when I have lived in Ireland I think my ""difficult"" relationship with alcohol started. It is not a mistery, that, drinking and being wasted on weekend is socially accepted. I barely got wasted, but definitely started to drink beer too often there. The fact I was unhappy at my job for the last year definitely didn't help.  


We've moved to Germany, and, pandemic happened, so wine was almost everyday, sometimes even 2 bottles (between me and my partner), lack of movement, sadness (you name it).  


Last couple of weeks I started to read a book, by David Nutt, it is one of the most recent book about the scientific findings of alcohol effect on brain and body. I was shocked, so, after 1st chapter we decided to stop drinking and one week passed already",31,1

I've had past stints where I quit for a month or so but 6 days ago a very scary situation happened to someone I care about (alcohol related, luckily everything is fine) that made me realize that I truly wanted to quit. 

I wanted to share my  early findings, as I think those of you stuck under a week in will find it helpful:

1. Waking up energized. By far the number 1 greatest thing ever.  I feel so refreshed and ready to hit the gym. 

2. Skin looks clearer/more colorful.  Hard to describe but I look healthier

3. Brain fog/anxiety gone.  I used to get anxiety (from drinking) and brain fog from it as well.  I used to just drink again the next day to ""fix it"" but we all know that doesnt work.  

4. You CAN be social.  This was a big one.  I had people over, a few were drinking and we were all just hanging out.   Things I used to attribute to drinking (good conversation, enjoying music or joking around) are all things I STILL DID and enjoyed sans booze.  Feels so great to know that I can still enjoy these things without the booze. 

5.  Responsibility.  If someone gets too hammered, you can drive them.  I actually did this over the weekend and knowing they got home safe, not the drunken ""Call me when the uber drops you off at home so I know you're okay"" felt amazing


I really believe I'm done with this for good and to those of you new like myself, hopefully this can help.

I been having very vivid weird dreams i dunno if thats due to my medication i take. Im bipolar and am medicated or because im not passing out drunk currently. But i been thinking what has caused my drinking to get out of control. I was dating a pretty bad alcoholic he drank a pint of vodka before he went to work everyday. He lived with me for a few months before i had to kick him out due to his drinking. I seen myself starting to show some signs that i was turning like him and thats what made me want to stop. I mean not as bad as drinking vodka before work but u get it. I also worked at a alcohol wholesale for 4 years so i was surrounded by alcohol all the time which didnt help.  I now have a new job. Addiction runs in my family so its very easy for me to fall into addiction and i have to be careful. I think when i was younger i was slowly becoming an alcoholic and those things where the last things that pushed me into drinking daily and larger amounts. I really dont want to become like my ex though. An alcoholic at 30 and needing a hip replacement at 30 due to liquor. Its sad to say but thats one of the things thats drives me to stop.,4,0

1158,2021-08-23 05:16:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p9w3t1/story_time/,Story time!,"Hi everyone, and thanks for all. A while ago I made a post where I said I should tell yo my story. I think the time has come.

So I'm a 22 French student who works to pay his studies, which means I don't live near my parents' (who are divorced) and I'm pretty independent (what a pleasure).
I've always liked partying, having fun, singing (well maybe just shouting), etc. I think you understand where I'm going, as I also began to like alcohol a bit too much.
On my mother side, who is married again, we often took the aperitive - 1 or 2 glasses and that was all. I think it was enough to make me normalize a regular consumption.

I first tasted whisky-coke when I was like 15 or 16, and I disliked it so when we took the aperitive I stayed on coke. But one day my step-father made me taste (and I don't blame him nor my family) Ricard, which I really loved.

I've always been a bon vivant, in fact.

And then I began to have parties with alcohol. Not big parties, only for 3 to 6-7 friends, so a pretty safe environment. And I began to drink in parties and I realized that I really like the taste, but also the feeling lf getting drunk. 

Then I left my parents' to study, and kept the habit of the aperitive, once a week, on sundays : three glasses. It was a real pleasure.

Then after a couple months I had my first party and I drunk a ridiculous amount of alcohol, I felt I couldn't stop. This is still my worst hangover. After a while, I began to party and get drunk every weekend. At the time it was only on weekends or when there were occasions to party because I like to party. After a moment I thought that I might stop taking aperitives by myself as I had occasions to drink.

I've always known that I could become an alcoholic, so I've always been careful about this, I always wanted to remain in control. But I noticed that I got close to lose control.

Between my 20 ans 21 I drank a lot, and often, and I didn't realize that it was a (bad) coping mechanism. I liked to party, on the moment I was having fun, and I liked to get back home walking and drinking by myself, with music in my earphones. These moments also were moments where I felt sad and depressed, with dark thoughts etc. That was a hint.

Some days, when I woke still drunk from the night, I drank to maintain it and on monday morning it occured more than once that I came to college still drunk from saturday night. 

During the first quarantine I often drank alone. I was seeking for drunkness, but I barely got that feeling so I continued to drink all night long and got to bed with frustration. I tried to do it not more than once a week, but it was difficult. And then with the summer it is easy to find friends to drink with. But I had realized that I had a real problem with it.

In September 2020 I had a blood test which stated that I should reduce my alcohol consumption. It was like slap in my face. I knew it, but then it became ""official"". In October, I remained sober. I wanted to take control again before alcohol takes control over me. I found it actually not that hard. I made another sober month in April I think, I forgot but the idea is that I also did a sober month in 2021.

But I still drank a lot and too much, it was self destructive, and I event hurt myself (which I hated).

And now I realized than since the end of July I don't want to get drunk anymore. I think I tend to naturally stop drinking, and it feels strange to say it. I have seen friends, some without drinking, some others drinking just a couple glasses, and it felt so good. Didn't have dark thougts etc.

Now, I don't want to destroy myself. I still have problems to deal, still have dark thoughts, but I don't want to run away from them, I want to overcome them. If I drink, I will surely hurt myself. I want to be healthy and happy. I don't need to hate myself more than this. Now, it's self care time! No self destructive mechanisms. It's time to respect my body and my heart.

I know I have been pretty lucky in this journey, but I also know that this journey isn't finished. I'll just try to take care of myself.

So I think I Will Not Drink With You Tonight, and for once I am not sorry.

Thank you so much.

Edit: I forgot a point!
I also noticed that my emotions are fucked up and I just get overwhelmed and don't know how to deal with them and I think that alcohol has a role in this. What do you think?",8,1

This 100 days have been a learning experience. I thought I'd share some of that here:

- I can still have fun without booze (more fun even)
- I am strong enough to manage my emotions without alcohol. 
- I am a better spouse and parent when I'm sober. 
- Other people are sober too and my friends respect my choices. 
- non alcoholic beer is just as good.
- I am much stronger, braver and smarter than I was while drinking. 

And the best bit is I've filled that 'drinking time' in the evenings and managed my cravings by getting more into gardening. 100 days of work and my garden looks beautiful. I've got a real passion for it and it's brought me so much joy. I might even change career!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Wow, I loved reading the check-ins yesterday. So much inspiration, encouragement, and most of all - community. u/ginger_sprout said it so well: ""On my own I got drunk, but together we stay sober."" 

&#x200B;

For a long time, I didn't talk to anyone about my drinking or sobriety. This sub was the only place I felt comfortable sharing. More recently, I've started building a community within Recovery Dharma, telling my close friends and family, and connecting with other sober people through social media. As my day count continues to grow, I'm looking forward to going deeper and strengthening the sense of community around me.

How about you? What role does community play in your sobriety? Where do you feel it most strongly?

I quit smoking and quit drinking on the same day. I didn't even realize I was going to quit for those first three days. I had a bad hangover, a massive amount of embarrassing and desperate texts sent to my ex ( who I do no care for and didn't at the time ) and a broken bathroom door covered in my blood. I laid in bed for the next 16 hours watching people speedrun video games and only got out of bed to make a burger and refill my empty gatorade bottle with water.

I skipped work the next day and turned my phone off. I didn't turn it back on until an hour before my next shift after that. I finally worked up the courage to go outside and smoke a cigarette. Not knowing at the time it would be the last cigarette I would smoke ( probably ). It was 4 am at this point. I still felt sick and couldn't quite comprehend what I was doing with my life. I went back inside, locked my door and went back too sleep.

I finally went to work, no one knew that I even missed a day, it was a volunteer shift go figure. I realized I was never gonna get past that 3 day hump of not smoking and not drinking again, because not doing anything all 3 days was hell. I felt like I couldn't drink without smoking and vise versa so I just said fuck it to both. 

Boom. I had quit just like that. I started looking at my finances, I had no savings. I started putting 100 a week into an account. Just like that. I wasn't sure what to do after that I was killing it I had a new car I had money coming in, instead of going out. Then I looked in the mirror for a long time, realized how fat I was and decided it was time to fix that too. I was obese. 5'4 at 230 pounds. I didn't want to go to the gym because of covid, so I just decided to buy a treadmill. I got the cheapest piece of shit I could find figuring I wouldn't need it long so it was ok if it broke. Did you guys know best choice makes treadmills? I laughed. Here I am today sitting at 163.4 pounds, overweight but so close to that coveted ""normal"". So far this is my progress [https://imgur.com/gallery/HDOsO3E](https://imgur.com/gallery/HDOsO3E)

I start going back to school tomorrow, I'm really excited that I don't manage a fast food restaurant anymore and I am looking forward to the next step. I had spent ten years living so I could die, instead of living to experience life. I will never fall into that trap again for the rest of my years and it feels so good to say IWNDWYT.

I have a lot of inner work to do, but Antabuse has been my saving grace for this month. I have just now really started to ‚Äúdo the work‚Äù as they say by sitting and down and examining why I used alcohol to cope for so long. I used to avoid thinking about this because it‚Äôs a bummer, but I know it‚Äôs the only way I will be able to heal. I have an appointment with a therapist soon who can hopefully help me sort it all out. No point to this post really just had a really good day and wanted to share. Love you all",25,0

Sadly, one of them is my very elderly mother. I only have to care for her on Saturdays but I hate it. I was her least favorite child. Rebellious, I left home in my teens because I couldn't stand life with her and my alcoholic abusive dad. Just walking into that house makes me feel like drinking. 

I manage her finances and other personal matters. She is very upset with me today because I was reeling drunk at her house yesterday and failed to hide it like I usually do because it's getting worse. She never drank in her life. Constant disapproval, complaints, bossiness, creating chaos and expecting someone else to fix her messes, then griping about how you fixed it. All she does is read the Bible and pray with church people on tge phone because she's so pious and perfect, ya know. Now I get why dad drank himself to death. I feel out of control like I did when I left home.

I just feel so guilty for not being able to be comfortable around her. I can't not go over there Saturdays. She is too old to be left alone. None of her favorites do anything for her. I am the retired one so  I ""have the time."" I can't stand those useless losers either. I worked hard all my life and planned my retirement. This is my reward?

As of today, it‚Äôs been 2 weeks since I last consumed alcohol. I had stopped drinking on weeknights during the couple weeks before that and had maybe the equivalent of a 6 pack over the course of each of the 2 prior weekends.

At the urging of my primary care provider and therapist, I agreed to speak to a nurse practitioner in a clinic that specializes in addiction. My liver enzymes had been elevated for years. At this point, the attempts I made to reduce or stop drinking in the years before only lasted a few days before I returned to the intake that would get me properly drunk and hazed out every night. Luckily, I was able to space out my drinking from my full-time job to where it wasn‚Äôt generally affected, aside from going in some mornings not feeling the greatest.

I was prescribed a medication that is supposed to reduce cravings, and it‚Äôs worked wonderfully for me. So far, I haven‚Äôt had any negative side effects. I had another appointment with my primary earlier this week where labs were drawn again and my liver enzyme levels are still elevated but have reduced significantly. It‚Äôs likely they‚Äôll be back in the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù range by my next appointment with her in October. I‚Äôve developed the sweet tooth that seems so common. Earlier this evening I made a batch of cookies from a bagged mix. While I‚Äôm packing most of them up to bring into work to share tomorrow, I helped myself to a number of them tonight.

I‚Äôve been been trying to find ways to occupy my time more in the evenings. I subscribed to one of those services that you pay a flat monthly fee for a library of games that can be downloaded and played on a computer. I‚Äôve been working on doing some deep cleaning and organizing of my home. I‚Äôve taken advantage of my local library‚Äôs digital collection of books, audio books, and magazines and have added at least half an hour of reading to my schedule every evening.

Something that I didn‚Äôt expect is an increased desire for intimacy. The thought has crossed my mind to set up an online dating profile, but I think I need to wait a little while longer. I think the shame that I carried of drinking heavily every night kept me from feeling worthy of being in any sort of relationship.  I‚Äôm feeling a little better these days but still have some things to work through.

 I'm slowly building a new daily routine. It's awkward right now, but I have hope. I'm looking to start waking up earlier to do some cardio/light training. I've always had a great metabolism so I haven't ever felt the need to get ""in shape."" But seeing as I am supposedly entering into my ""prime"" as a 32 y/o male, I figure I should dive head-first into creating some new physical habits NOW- as much as I'm dreading it, as opposed to later, when it will be even more difficult.

Anyways, does anyone have any good recommendations of some morning routines that would be a good place to start for someone like me, who has little to NO experience in this area? Any subreddits I should be aware of that might help me really get started?

No sleep for two nights - mild hallucinations and pretty bad anxiety the first night and stress about Mom the second night. Day 2 she came home and I was better though extremely tired. Day 3 today, still tired, still brain fog. Able to eat and hydrate (and sleep) again. Still crampy stomach and bathroom has not returned to normal. Sweaty and cold at the same time.


Coming off a 5 day extreme binge relapse (probably at least 18-24 beers a day - I know I can't handle hard alcohol or wine, but like any alcoholic I had to try beer because I thought I could). Had 97 days prior to relapsing, but was home alone and am gearing up to start a new job post Covid and aside from working with my therapist, had kind of taken my sobriety for granted since I'd had no real cravings before that.

Started having problems 2012-2015. I've gone to 5 different rehabs. Sober from 2015-2018, got an amazing job, built a really awesome life! Got in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic who kept relapsing and it took me out. Spent 2018 to present losing my job, moving home after my 2nd DUI (30 jail, 90 house arrest), on a cycle of 30-60-90 days sober followed by severe 2-5 day binges. Luckily my mom and others will not let me keep going, because I should be dead many times over. Hospital at least 15x, jail twice, homeless, ICU twice. I'm a 34 year old female and would regularly drink a half gallon a day.

I guess I just wanted to write that out. I built good habits during my last 97 days and look forward to feeling good again, running, starting new job. Examining what went wrong and what I can do in the future to prevent relapse. Will be meeting with my therapist next week and returned to this community. If I keep going I will die and I don't want that. So for today I am resting and hydrating and trying to be patient on feeling better. And IWNDWYT :)",6,2

_""Or, again, watch people at a gay [happy] evening. All come determined to be happy, with the kind of grim resolve with which one determines not to make a fuss at the dentist‚Äôs. It is held that drink and petting are the gateways to joy, so people get drunk quickly, and try not to notice how much their partners disgust them. After a sufficient amount of drink, men begin to weep, and to lament how unworthy they are, morally, of the devotion of their mothers. All that alcohol does for them is to liberate the sense of sin, which reason suppresses in saner moments.""_

_""*Drunkenness, for example, is temporary suicide*; the happiness that it brings is merely negative, a momentary cessation of unhappiness. The narcissist and the megalomaniac believe that happiness is possible, though they may adopt mistaken means of achieving it; but the man who seeks intoxication, in whatever form, has given up hope except in oblivion.""_
 
_""I do not of course deny that a man may be broken by sorrow, but I do say that everyman should do his utmost to escape this fate, and should seek any distraction, however trivial, provided it is not in itself harmful or degrading. Among those that I regard as harmful and degrading I include such things as drunkenness and drugs, of which the purpose is to destroy thought, at least for the time being...""_

Upon recommendation of my psychologist, I'm currently reading Bertrand Russell's book on his quest (and success) of finding happiness. It is written in an extremely accessible and pragmatic manner and deals with many of the facets of life which lead to unhappiness (and how to overcome them). Naturally, there are a ton of self-help books on the matter, but with respect to other authors, I believe that the words of Russell hold a bit more weight as his life's work was founded upon analytical philosophy, not to mention the fact that he was highly influential on 20th century intellectual giants - but I digress.

What struck me is that within the first few pages he makes mention of the fact that alcohol is a source of profound unhappiness. In fact, he even writes that _""drunkenness is temporary suicide""_ and the topic is discussed about a dozen times in the book, along with beautifully written logic on why _happy people_ don't need it.

I thoroughly urge anyone reading this post to get a copy of the book. It is only 194 pages and contains so many actionable suggestions on how to increase one's happiness in just about every facet of one's life - work, home, social settings, solitary moments, in jealous situations, family matters, and love.

I'm a little over a week sober at this point, and physically and mentally I feel great. I've been listening to This Naked Mind on audiobook, replacing drinking with healthy habits, and sharing my journey with my spouse and my closest friend. I haven't really felt the urge to drink, but I feel very tender about recognizing my addiction with others.

&#x200B;

I could use some advice. Every Sunday, we visit my in-laws for dinner. FIL is a heavy drinker and really, *really* likes company while drinking. He shows affection with food and drink, and since I don't eat meat (his favorite thing to make), beer and tequila used to be our connection. He also is really snotty when people say no to drinking. I opted out of visiting them this Sunday because I wasn't prepared for this conversation, but I know realistically I will be visiting with them in the future in situations with a lot of alcohol.

&#x200B;

I don't feel safe enough around my in-laws to share that I am sober. While MIL is a teetotaler, she doesn't really see a problem with drinking. FIL and SIL both drink heavily. The family has lost two members to alcoholism, but doesn't really discuss that. They joke a lot about drinking and are weirdly condescending about people who don't drink, like my husband and MIL. Last time I said no to a drink, my FIL ribbed me the whole night (for context, I said it was too hot to drink since it was about 107F/41C. He mentioned that sarcastically a few times throughout the night).

Another shitty Monday as the least productive member of my work team. You know how it goes. 

I made it about two weeks completely sober (my badge isn't completely accurate), with no intentions to drink, and then I kind of ruined it for myself. Out boating with friends, and I thought aloud - ""Man, a cold beer would be good right now"" - nobody was drinking and I figured there wasn't any booze about, till my body reached into his backpack and tossed me a beer. I didn't have the heart to turn it down at that point, so I drank it but did my best not to enjoy it, haha. We then went to a taco joint and it was ""national margarita day"", so I caved and had a marg. Couldn't even taste the booze in it, so that was good. I did immediately feel how it affected me though, and I was surprised how strongly I felt the depressant effects.

Before bed that night, I figured my ""streak"" was already forfeit, so I grabbed one of my roommates IPAs and took a swig. I don't know if it was rotten or just extremely hazy, but it literally tasted like stomach acid. Took that as a sign and dumped it.

Since then it has been almost a month, and I'm very proud of how I've been able to handle some tempting situations. 

Game night with friends, one guy kept having me taste his different craft beers after cracking them. I had told them I wasn't drinking that night, but hadn't elaborated. Pleased to say I was able to taste-test the various beers without giving in.

Camping with friends. They all passed bottles around, while I stayed sober and basked in the night. Had a great time and honestly didn't even feel tempted.

And finally last night. My dad wanted to go into town and see a couple live bands at these real divey small town bars. Had some high-anxiety moments, with drunk middle-aged woman trying to chat up both me and my dad (lol). Became very aware of the incredible stench of alcohol breath, I was probably catching a buzz just listening to this gal talk. And the repetitive stories, jesus. Some stranger asked me where our cocktails were (my dad  doesn't drink) and I stumbled over my words trying to say that I wasn't drinking, without explicitly stating that I wasn't drinking. Like that's something to be ashamed of? Anyway, survived the night and went home sober from a bar at midnight, so that's a first.

I figure I'll stay sober at least till September, so I can say I've had a month sober, for the first time ever. (Also, who does sober August? lol). Will I drink after that? Eventually, probably. Or maybe not. I know I absolutely feel better on multiple fronts, not drinking. I know that I can have just as much enjoyment at events I'd normally attend inebriated, and possibly have an even better time. I know I can resist temptation. I know that I can recover from a slip up. I know that minimizing the role of alcohol in my life has a positive effect on my physical and mental health.

Bought some Taco Bell on the way home as a treat. The sun was shining. Life was feeling.... good? Hadn't really felt that feeling in a long while.

I get back home and I'm just chilling, scrolling reddit/twitter like usual. But of course, there MUST be a catch...

Pops calls. Left work early, again. Except this time the car is having issues and he needs me to bring my brother and some jumper cables. Goddamit, I'm trynna chill. Fine, be there soon.

So we spend about half an hour trying to get enough of a charge to get the couple miles home and we can't even get out of the parking lot. So we need a new battery. Fine. Also need tools to replace the battery. Fine. Get in my car and we'll go get those things. But no. Right before we decide to leave the car in the lot overnight, lil bro locks the keys in the car. Now I'm beyond frustrated.

Silent car ride home. But hey, there's football on in a bit, and some meat to grill. Cool. Except those are two of my big triggers. After an especially triggering afternoon.

Yup. I drank. I asked for just a little bourbon for while I'm grilling and then I'd switch to my NA beer. Well, that ""2-3"" shots of bourbon ended up being about 12. I regretted my decision after the first shot, but ""fuck it, you already drank that one. You'd be lying if you said you stayed sober.""

So, as usual, I awoke this morning after about 3 hours of drunken ""sleep"" to crippling anxiety and an inability to stop the thoughts long enough to sleep. But this time, it was extra spicy. On top of the alcohol-induced anxiety where I'm already worrying about my health, the side-effects of the vaccine were kicking my ass at the same time. My neck ached like I spent the night headbanging at a concert. Fever, so I could never find the comfy cool spot. Body aches randomly all over.

I developed some heart problems and took Asprin for the pain. It helped, but I was still in a dark place at the time. The reason: my drinking got out of hand and it was hurting my heart and stomach.

I woke up feeling groggy and decided to make a cup of cafe bustello and eat Dannon Yogurt for a snack before making dinner. Now, I know why I quit alcohol...I want my health back! I n fact, it was one of those ""past drunken self"" dreams that are pushing me forward to stay sober.

To all the members out there, I read a lot of instances where pancreatitis, hepatitis, and acid reflux are common due to heavy drinking.

I have to remember that the reason I drank to excess before was because I liked how it made me feel, it temporarily numbed difficult feelings and gave me confidence when I had none.  I've long since lost the urge to drink,  but those underlying feelings of self doubt and being my own worst critic are very much still there.  The feelings I was masking are very much unmasked.

It reminds me that sobriety isn't a cure all.  It won't transform your life in itself, however it is the platform on which progress can be made.

Through the past year I have had many trials and tribulations.  I was served with divorce papers less than a week after my last drunk, i have started a new position at work, i am studying to get my Business Administration degree, i have 3 children that i cant see as much as i would like, i attend my 12 step meetings 4 times a week and hit the gym 4-5. Times a week. 

While some of these issues are are hard to deal with and are time consuming,  i have created a balance between the good and bad. Bad being divorce and not seeing the kids as much as id like. Dealing with lawyers, paying child support, which is 29%, but after loans, insurance and misc, i am left with minimal cash. In the middle is school and work. School is good in the long term, but it takes lots of time and dedication. Work is good to for seeing people, not isolating, and doing something that makes a difference.  Finally going to 12 step meetings and the gym are immidiate for boosting my spirits. 

I have learned that the balance includes stimulation of the mind, body and spirit. Touching all three points as many times as possible,  greatly increase my chances of not picking up. I was sick in all three of these areas, and its still a work in progress. Spiritual progress is the key to opening up the doors to progress of the mind and body.

Usually when we'd both been out drinking on a rare night out together something would come up and we'd end up arguing. I always assumed it was me and my drinking that was causing problems.

Until just this evening my husband went out for an afternoon drinking with his friends while I stayed home and looked after our toddler. I don't mind staying home with the kiddo. In fact I quite enjoy having some time to myself when he's gone to bed and my husband's still out. I was quite looking forward to that this evening. 
Except my husband felt like he needed to rush home (I didn't even ask him to)  and order a Takeaway I didn't ask for, then complain that he'd torn himself away from his friends to be home and complain more that now he has to eat a massive Takeaway (that again I didn't ask for. I already took care of my own dinner). Then start picking an argument about how he always has to stay home with our toddler while I go to a BBQ or something at my sister's house (that he's always invited to, he's just for some reason antisocial with my family and always avoids stuff like that). And this was when he had literally just walked in the door from being out all afternoon with his mates...

I guess the point of me rambling is that it I always figured it was me being drunk and causing arguments when actually I think it's his problem. His drunken argumentative streak. His inability to see reason when he's had a few.

I'm not saying it's an excuse for me to start drinking again. I much prefer not waking up with a hangover and the satisfaction of knowing I'm not the one being an arse. And I don't think he would ever quit drinking. But is an observation I've made.",10,0

I literally woke up every day uttering the words ""I need to quit"". However, every night I would inevitably grab that first beer anyway.

I liked drinking and it was such a big part of my life that I couldn't imagine quitting entirely. At one point, going to sleep sober actually scared me since I hadn't done it in years. Because of that I have been trying to at least moderate for the past 2 years. Those efforts have failed miserably. On days where I was able to hold myself to ""only"" 4 beers, I got angry that I couldn't have more. I would always drink 2x as much the days after to celebrate my ""success"" at only drinking 4. I also really wanted to be able to have 3-4 sober days per week but I never even managed to get one sober day in, let alone 3. The good news is that my failed attempts to moderate has shown me that I simply can't do it.

The desire to quit was there, but I couldn't bring myself to actually do it for years. That is, until I started recognizing the signs that I was having alcohol withdrawal symptoms virtually every day. I tried cutting back and pacing myself, but that just meant I drank one beer an hour from 4PM till 2AM with a few extra ones thrown in there for good measure. By pacing myself, I never got to the ""happy place"" where I was drunk enough to feel the euphoric feelings, which meant I just felt deprived. I eventually drank more than if I had just gotten drunk earlier in the evening. So much for moderation.

I will have 7 full days when I go to bed tonight and I am at peace with my decision to not drink anymore. I feel like I have done this on my own terms, which is important to me because I don't feel like my wife or anyone else is forcing me to get sober. This was MY decision and I have zero regrets or resentment about it. I am already starting to get projects done and I am finally getting a full night's sleep. This feels good.

I fall asleep long before that can happen. I don't do wild and crazy things that I have intense regret over. But still, I am always disappointed in myself. That is how I feel this morning. I have to work today and yesterday I told myself that if I drank at all in the evening, I would keep it really light so I could wake up and get a workout in before I have to head into work. Well, I drank far too many high ABV beers and woke up late feeling like shit. I'm not going to have time to get a workout in before work. I feel anxious and sad that I let myself down again.

The thing is, my job is super stressful. I dread Sundays especially because there is a lot to do when I get into the office. So Saturdays I just want to drink and relax. Then on Sundays, I usually just sleep until I have to go in. I sleep because if I am awake, then I will just feel anxious all day. I hate it. Part of me wants to just quit my job and do something less stressful. I won't though, there isn't another career path for me where I can do nearly as well.

So, drinking, sleeping, and sometimes overindulging in food are the three main ways that I ""hide"" from my uncomfortable emotions. Drinking is by far the most destructive though. I like the idea of having a drink or two, but I almost always have much more than that and my weekends end up being giant wastes that I don't really enjoy. I stopped drinking for a few years and that was the best time in my life by far. 

I don't know how to stop though. I don't think I really have the motivation and I guess that's why I am here. I know if I keep drinking, it's not going to magically get better and I'll gain control one day. I think the only thing to do is quit entirely.",14,0

I‚Äôll keep it snappy!

I‚Äôm in 12 step recovery for alcohol.

Never needed anything else to feel good/calm my mind.

I drank to get drunk - both in public but mostly private - on average 3 times a week.

I was socially anxious and fearful of the world and it‚Äôs people. There was no physical or sexual child abuse for me growing up.

I was bullied I felt awful about myself. At home we never spoke honestly about feelings and emotions like I am in this post.

My dad is a narc. My mum is a codependent. Iam an alcoholic. 

Despite this being true, I believe that it is my reaction to the world and it‚Äôs people and events that was the problem. 

I started abusing alcohol from about 19. Just to calm myself and to feel ok. 

At some point I was hooked. I couldn‚Äôt stop. I tried to stop and I couldn‚Äôt. 

With the help of others, aiming to be humble, grateful, and living a life of surrender - plus helping others to get out of my own head - and lots of regular meetings, I no longer crave alcohol.


The craving for alcohol went after about 60-90 days of daily meetings and working with a sponsor. That takes faith that I can be saved and surrender to be told what to do to change. 

I‚Äôm one of the lucky ones.

As I write this I‚Äôm having an off few hours. I‚Äôm anxious. But it will pass. And it‚Äôs nothing compared to alcohol withdrawals and all the pain and suffering alcohol caused me.

I‚Äôm here to say it is possible to be free of alcohol generally feel at ease with this life.

I‚Äôm also here to say that as an alcoholic, if you take my alcohol away, I need a replacement. Mine is a 12 step programme, love understanding and connection with those that have walked the path before me.

4 months in my brother died from this deadly disease and I stood my ground and said I will not drink today!! 
And that continues to be one of my greatest motivators.

I went through a sort of mental break down for a day or week or so but I held my ground and didn't drink. It just felt like I had this enormous amount of pressure. Still happens sometimes but I have learn to try to focus on one thing at a time.

Went to my buddies Friday night beer session and didn't drink! Had a lovely time playing cards and what not, biked home and made it home safely in the wee hours of the night. 

Went to my buddies open bar wedding and didn't drink! I remember the whole night and even drove them all to their hotel at the end of the night! 

Went to a baseball game where normally I would have had at least four tall boys there but instead I didn't drink. Had a delicious ice tea while my best friends boyfriend spilt beer all around our feet so it was a sticky mess after that.

All the brain power spent trying to prove the light at the end of the tunnel was not a train was an exercise is self deception.

The debating society that worked on the nuances of ""too much"" versus ""enough"".  The cataloging of the symptoms of alcoholism I did not have - finding exceptions and loopholes to common sense.

All I did was postpone the inevitable and create more wreckage that would need be cleared as a part of the recovery process.

I don't regret it, I don't have a time machine.  Forgiveness is giving up all hope of an alternative past.  

I've been sober for a long time though it is perhaps better described as recovery.  I have today things I never dreamed I could - and perhaps tops on the list is being comfortable in my own skin.  I've got nothing to prove, no points I have to make, no need to correct others.  I am happy.  My life is far from perfect, but I accept it on its terms and don't waste energy on things I don't have. 

All of this and much more because I finally stopped trying to prove that I was right, and put down the drink, and then did the work on myself necessary to fill that black hole I was trying to fill with booze and other things.

""You don't really have a problem"", was the answer I wanted to hear.  The fact I was the only one telling myself that shoulda been a clue.  Other people at the bar agreed with me - but even I knew they were not people I should listen to - after all I was there in part so I could point to them as the ones with the real problems...

30 days to go to my year anniversary of sobriety!  


To mark it I have organized a night of celebration, a dinner, some laser tag - a trip down memory lane to watch a recording of a musical I starred in years ago before my journey into deep beer haze for nearly 9 years.  


I've invited 80 of my friends to shared this time for reflection and look to the next steps of growth in my long journey of recovery. I feel like a madman, wanting to shriek the invite to come join this celebration to the neighborhood. The problem is. I'm scared the people I want to come will make other plans. I feel like I am overcompensating my ego and giving my friends an excuse to blend into the crowd and not attend.  


I feel I have also opened myself up for examination to these people, at every experience we shared, was I drunk off my face, was our friendship fake? I know these things are rogue ideations that stand aside in due time for my spirit to soar.

Does anyone have advice on how  can protect myself, so I don't fail myself, and my friends who want to share the joy of my momentous personal achievement.

Thank you for being such a  warming community, and inspiring my daily steps through temptation. I wish I could invite many of you to share this dinner and hang with me.

I have to stop drinking. My problem is, every time I make a little progress, a neighbour wants to have a beer in the driveway or a coworker wants to get a drink after work. I always rationalize that it's ""just one,"" but then one turns into picking up a six pack and needing the buzz of liquor, so another trip to the liquor store. Suddenly, I've drunk half a 750 mls bottle and have to go to work the next day. I'm so tired of brain fog and confusion, and I'm afraid to stop drinking because it takes me several days for my sleep ability to adjust. So I further rationalize -- if I'm going to have brain fog anyway, at least I might as well feel like I slept. 

Anyway, a couple weeks back I decided to go camping for a weekend. I was going to use it as a way to reset myself. No alcohol, long hikes, cook over a fire. As I drove through the last town before the campground, you guessed it...stop at the liquor store. I bought 4 750ml bottles. 

I get to the campground, leave the liquor in the trunk, set up, and decide to take a hike before I build a fire and cook supper. Inexplicably, I pack a bottle in my backpack to go with me, reasoning that I'll just sip a little as I walk. By the time I get back, half the bottle is gone. I don't feel like I can safely build a fire so I eat baby carrots and dry cereal, then go to my tent and finish the bottle. I must have gotten up in the night to piss, or who knows what, but I woke in the morning feeling ill with the tent door flapping in the wind, wide open. 

Somehow I got some breakfast down and figured walking was better than sitting so I took off for another very long hike and, of course, took another bottle with me. I hate to admit that I drank this whole bottle on a hike. I have no idea how I was standing up, but when I got back to my site, went right into the tent and got started on my third bottle. I must have passed out at some point because it was dark when I woke and figured what the hell, so I finished the third bottle. 

The rock bottom point for me came when I woke up inside one of the camp vault toilets, naked, and covered in shit and vomit. Thankfully it was still dark, so I could stumble back to my site unseen, but it really scared me because I didn't remember going there or what I had done or where I might have gone, and I was naked. To prevent things from getting even worse, when I got back to my site I poured out the fourth bottle into the fire pit and then slept it off in my tent. I felt so bad that I called the camp office and reserved another night so I wouldn't have to pack up and drive home...there was no way I could safely drive home. Spent the day shivering in my tent despite the heat and still on Monday morning felt like garbage but I packed up and drove home. 

You'd think I'd have learned but since the trip, I'm still drinking about half a bottle a night, plus beers, and don't know how to stop. All of this started as an adult because I was pushing back against my controlling religious upbrining where drinking was a ""sin,"" and I knew better, but I guess the alcohol knew me better than my own self.

Anyway, just needing to get this out so I can write my own embarrassment and hope it's a wakeup call for me. Thank you to anyone who stuck with this drivel and actually read it.",51,0

My husband is coming home from rehab the first week in September. I am so flipping proud of him and he has been having a great and positive experience. The program (VA) does not do family involvement but we talk every day. 

Relationship-wise there was trust that was broken on his side when he was hiding his drinking and it did strain our relationship. We have been working though that and I'm working with my therapist on not going into ""work"" mode with him. I'm a nurse and sometimes it was hard to take off my nurse hat when I saw him drunk, lying about it, and knowing his medical background (advanced liver disease). 

Other than working on our trust, we're both doing well. He sees the joy in being sober (and is reading the Unexpected Joy of Being Sober a second time with way more understanding). What both makes us a little anxious is him coming out of the controlled environment. He's updating his discharge plan to make sure he has an out-patient program. 

So, any other tips for when he comes home? What helped you all out that maybe wasn't thought of or was seen as a small thing but turned into an ""oh, that little minor thing ended up making a huge difference""?",6,0

But only Day 3 of my annual cottage getaway.,"Today is Day 161 for me. In the last five months, I have turned so much in my life around. I am healthier, in a better financial position, in a happier relationship and my anxiety I'd not nearly what it used to be. My cravings have been few and far between. Things have been going well!

However, this week I went to my best friend's cottage. I go every year and it's an amazing place on an island and it can accommodate an insane amount of people. This is the 16th year in a row I have gone, and every previous time I have got wasted each time I went.

Going through it sober has been challenging. Everyone but me and one of my friends (who is pregnant) has been drinking, and a few people have been smoking pot. In the past I would have been so into that, it's quite an adjustment to put myself in a situation so heavily associated with drinking and decide not to drink. I think a few people have been doing a bit of blow, which has never really appealed to me all that much.

Honestly, I have had a pretty amazing time, but it has been challenging at moments. It's been a long time since I cared if other people were drinking, but this trip has brought back feelings of FOMO for the first time in a while. I've found myself really paying attention to what is in other people's cups and wishing I could partake. I've also kind of craved the pot people have been smoking and oddly at one point I found myself thinking it would be nice if I could have some of the blow (even though I have only ever done blow one time in my life and it wasn't here).

I want to reaffirm that I am committed to this decision and I will not be drinking (or smoking/snorting) anything this weekend. This trip might be tough but it's work that I need to do. 

The temporary euphoria would not be worth the hangover and the feeling of fitting in that I would briefly experience would not be worth the shame and anxiety in the morning. I want to feel pride at the end of this weekend, not disappointment.

And honestly, there are elements of the trip that have been amazing. I tried wakeboarding for the first time this year, and even though I was unsuccessful at it, I had fun. I would probably have been to anxious to give it a go if I had been drinking.

It's no surprise to anyone I know I decided to start transitioning. To no one except me, who was sure suffering was simply my lot in life. And every time I couldn't be me out of fear... I drank and became the worst version of me. That's what happened when I last reset my counter: I chickened out in face of overwhelming social anxiety and drank... and realized I NEVER wanted to feel like that, EVER again. 

&#x200B;

When it came to social events though, I never thought the cloud of my boozing past would lift. I never thought I'd get over my fears and doubts. I am just getting home now, sweaty and tired but sober, and it feels like finally - finally - I can trust myself around alcohol and people. Cause I did it once. With hiccups and despite not being in the best mental state. Plus I drank so much water I nearly threw up because I forgot to eat (I drink a LOT when I'm nervous). Also had to lie down three times cause the noise (tbh it wasn't that loud) and crowd was too much but no one minded and everyone at the party I knew, many of whom were there for me during the worst years of alcohol and drug abuse, after my best friend died, were all so proud and happy to see how far I'd come. Talking about the past and our memories made me very emotional. In a good way. Mostly.

&#x200B;

And of course a drunk guy tried to hit on me (yet again). It was odd seeing a reflection of the past and feeling a mix of pity and exasperation. Yep. I know what it's like and nope. You do not have a chance. Tony, I'm sure you're a good person, deep down, but you sure weren't showing it and I will not be sad to never meet you again. It struck me most how timid you were around me, as though I were a delicate wall flower.  The only thing stopping me from mercilessly abusing your intoxicated state and my good standing with my friends was pity. You creeped me the fuck out and your antics were juvenile. Good luck with the hangover and, while I didn't say it, I know your biggest fear is that you're my age with no children. And no partner. And zero stomach to face your emotional baggage. I wonder why - and I wonder how angry I could have made you by poking in the big sore wounds you randomly blabbed out. Did you even think about what you said, pretending not to be phased by your utter lack of self worth? Or were you so drunk you thought it would be a good idea to bare your belly to an utter stranger and then creep them out? Yeesh. 

&#x200B;

It then occurred to me: strangers don't know how vile I can be. They don't know my past and cannot see those sides of me alcohol used to bring out regularly.  All they see is the present. Not how I got to the version of me they witness. It's strange to realize that even though it should be self evident.

&#x200B;

My lasting impression of last night was: I have not changed fundamentally. I am socially awkward and still do not care about social conventions. I still go into social situations expecting the worst. I still for some reason suspect my friends cause I don't really trust anyone and require a looong time to adjust to a new situation. And the cruel side of me is just as present as it was. But I approach myself differently. I can chose which side of me to show. I can decide what I will do. Most of all: I know what I want beyond a shadow of a doubt. I want to continue a sober life. A life of healing and learning and baby steps towards a better future. I will always know I can be a horrible person cause booze shattered my illusion of moral superiority. But I do not need to be that person most of the time and that's a big relief.

&#x200B;

Also, drunk people are weird. Like broken records. I kept hearing people's brains cycle through patterns over and over. It's odd to watch, knowing exactly how someone feels but not sharing that state of intoxication. It's almost a relief to see that play out - alcohol never ""made me crazy"". It does the same shit to everyone. No exceptions.

&#x200B;

It took 3 years since I quit to feel real positive effects on my life. It took me 10 years after realizing I could not handle booze to quit. My life is not magical sunshine and roses due to my decision to improve. It's taken ungodly ammounts of patience and self care to coax myself out of that miserable hole. But wow am I glad I got so desperate I gave sobriety a try. So much good has come of that ond crazy decision. I wanted to share this both cause it's big to me and cause I think, maybe, someone else needs to hear that even if it takes for fricking ever to get ahead, sobriety is worth it in the long run. And even if you don't truly believe that (I sure didn't 4 years ago) then maybe, just maybe, it's worth a try just to see what happens. I mean it cannot be worse, can it?",13,0

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning / evening, SD. It is an honor to be your host this week and many thanks to u/SaintHomer for the opportunity.

&#x200B;

One of my favorite things about SD (and there are many!) is that we are united by exactly one thing: the desire to stop drinking. No matter who we are, where we live, what we've done - we share this one thing. For me, this also means that I can bring who I am TODAY to this sub. Sometimes, I feel fantastic and am eager to share that joy with others. Other times (like more recently), I feel low and need the encouraging words of my fellow sobernauts. No matter what, this sub is home and I always feel better for having spent time here.

No less than a pint. Weeks of where I wasn't sober for a second.

I couldn't do it on my own. My primary care Dr. tried to help me withdrawl with benzos. It worked...for a couple days. I went back to binging and drinking through kindling.

I finally went to an out patient treatment that had medically assisted treatment. The therapy wasn't working alone and my cravings were intense. I went for vivitrol because I didnt trust myself to take the naltrexone pills properly. After going through my medical history fully we went on. The shot didnt hurt. I felt a little weak, a bit of nausea and the common side effects. I can honestly say the vivitrol cut cravings the same day. I think about alcohol less and when I do it's very easy to switch a topic and even think ""gross"" when it happensm

On top of the vivitrol he wanted me on something for withdrawl that wasn't a benzo and I agreed. I knew about gabapentin and felt comfortable trying. I'm on 600mg three times a day. In starting I feel a little loopy walking. Somehow more focused and also a bit confused. It's very sleepy but ot helps with that. I've also found myself less anxious but a bit emotional. Also throws off my gait and walking right after each dosemI expect this to pass in time.

I'm also going to AA meetings and group meetings to help with the mental side as these meds are more for physical cravings.

All in all I'm very happy. The symptoms are bareable if you have time to rest. It's way better than a hangover. I don't feel amazing but I'm also still withdrawling. I look forward to updating my progress. IWNDWYT.",8,0

I adopted her at 4, she was currently 8. For the entire time I owned her, and for long before, I had been drinking too much to be a good parent for her.

But she was extremely depressed. And I didn‚Äôt want her to die without getting to actually experience life. It broke me. I knew I needed to change.

So I did. September 20th,2020, I stopped drinking. Since then, things are remarkably better in almost every way.

My relationships and friendships improve every day. Just tonight my mother said she loves talking to me regularly again. I can work longer hours, I go to the gym every day.

It wasn't until November of last year that I came clean about my secret drinking and ended up in the ER and spending 3 days in the hospital. 

There is a lot I think about in retrospect.

Did they not notice I was drunk? Or did they just have faith in me and take my word that I was sober? They definitely told me how betrayed they felt after they found out the truth. 

I was furloughed at the time, we got news people were being laid off, and as a supervisor I was getting 20 calls a day from people scared they would lose their jobs. I was scared I was going to lose mine. I pretended to be put together on the phone with them, but after every call I had a drink.

I relapsed right after I reached 6 months, and I remember I had still acted like I reached 8 months, 9 months, etc. all the way until October 28th when it would have been a year. And everyone believed me.

Now I'm just a bit over 9 months, I've surpassed my record, and I still have a huge support network. I'm very lucky for the people I have in my life and the support I receive.

Sorry for the long post, I just wanted to share my story (since so far I've benefited so much in hearing others' stories) and my progress.

&#x200B;

I'm a secret alcoholic with a wife and 1yo son, and it's taken this break from alcohol (currently 11 days AF) to make me realize just how insanely I've been gambling when it comes to keeping the house of cards together.

My story is a bit different from many I see here, in that I'd been very inconsistent in my drinking. I would not drink a day or two here or there (probably never more than 3 days in a row in the last 5 years however), and it was to varying degrees. 1, 2, 3 beers many nights; 5 beers and a mickey's worth of vodka or gin on many other nights. My worst and latest habit was that I often drank throughout the day, especially at work, in order to keep my anxiety at bay - especially if I had a big presentation or meeting I was nervous about. Somehow I convinced myself this was acceptable - I would quit and deal with it later I suppose.

How much I was drinking is very much a secret from everyone, particularly my wife. There are many nights where I would come upstairs plastered after drinking swigs from the bottle (to be replaced with water until I could secretly refill them later - my wife rarely drinks so I only had to worry if we were going to have company), or I would come home from work drunk. She has a bad sense of smell which probably helped me get away with it. I had wondered if deep down she had known, but in my current clarity I'm certain she doesn't.

&#x200B;

I recently decided enough was enough. It took waking up at 3:00am filled with anxiety and not having any memory whatsoever of bathing my son and putting him to bed for which I felt so ashamed.

Now what's helping to keep me going is just thinking about all the ways that this house of cards could've come falling down. Maybe I would get a DUI, maybe I'd get caught at work and suspended or fired. Maybe my wife would just plain catch me and get a divorce. Maybe the unthinkable could happen while I was in no state to be caring for my son.

The dumbest part about this gamble is that there was nothing to be won.

&#x200B;

I've decided I'm not going to tell my wife about this. When she notices I'm not drinking, I plan to simply tell her that I felt drinking wasn't doing me any favours.

Not telling her is a hard decision - it would be emotionally liberating to not have to carry this secret, but ultimately the consequences would be severe. Instead I'd rather make it up to my family by building a stable structure where this house of cards has been.

I also realize, reading the stories of others' here, that things can go plenty wrong after 11 days of no alcohol, so I need to be diligent and careful, but I'm hopeful and will use this to motivate me.

&#x200B;

Lastly, for anyone wondering about my experience of 11 days AF:

\-Going AF has done wonders for my anxiety and self esteem. I was using alcohol as a crutch and no longer believed I could deal with anxious situations without it. I'm shocked at how quickly the intensity of my anxiety has waned - I still feel anxious about things but I'm no longer immediately thinking that I need a drink.

\-I'm so glad to not be obsessing over the logistics of how I was going to buy more alcohol and sneak it into the house. I'm glad to not have to be paranoid about my wife finding my cans and bottles that I've hid until I can throw out.

\-I've naturally been more present at home and I can feel it's helping my marriage (having your 1st kid is hard on a marriage on its own)

\-I'm so thankful for the life I have. I have everything to lose - a stable career, an amazing wife and my son, the love of my life

&#x200B;

I realize I'm still in a honeymoon phase with regards to quitting drinking - it's exciting and energizing me and I know that won't always be the case. I do feel like something has clicked and I hope I can use this newfound gratitude to keep me from going to my old ways. Thanks for reading, I'm hoping committing this to writing (even anonymously) will remind me of the way I feel about things now, should that change.

Thanks for hearing me out, IWNDWYT.",31,0

I'm (M31) sat on the end of my bed, hangover from hell, the love of my life and partner of six years just left me. I lost my temper... again. But this time I smashed our new TV and threatened to smash numerous other things. I was over two hours late for work and I barely remember a thing. 

I have alcoholism run through my family (both parents sides) and I have always been conscious that I will not become that person.

Well it's dawned on me that my behaviour and relationship with alcohol is getting progressively worse. This last stunt has topped it all off.

Now, I don't think I have a dependence on alcohol, at least not yet, I can go days or even weeks without drinking. But when I do drink my decisions and emotions completely change who I am. 

I become so self absorbed that nothing else matters apart from getting another drink. I often have to be persuaded to stop drinking and always want another. 

The majority of the time I stop, though sometimes I just do not and get to the point where I get blackout drunk and cannot remember a thing. Like a switch goes and nothing can stop me. I'm becoming more confrontational, more aggressive each time. 

The scary part is I'm not a violent guy, I never have been while sober and very rarely while drunk. Except its becoming a common theme. The guilt and shame that I'm the one who's caused this, shattered her life, our life, our future, all for what? 

Sorry if this is a ramble I do not know what I expect to achieve, maybe some catharsis or advice.

But I have accepted who I am, what I am when I drink, a monster. And I need help.",21,0

One thing I didn't mention was the hospital pain killers.

I dealt with worse pain than I probably should have dealt with because I steadfast refused to take OTC pain pills for months. I went 5 months with homeopathic remedies and only caved when I couldn't sleep. I did get prescribed opioids a few weeks before my surgery but thankfully I didn't feel any pain relief with them and didn't take them.

When I was in the hospital post surgery, I didn't get pain killers until about 10 hours after my surgery (partly my fault for not wanting to the bother the nurse). I was crying by the time the nurse came in and she gave me an IV shot of pain killers instead of the pill variety. It helped and every 4 hours I'd get more.

The way it dulled the pain, I still think about it even though I'm now 4 months post-surgery. I haven't drank in over 2 years and I am really glad I don't have access to the fast IV relief of painkillers.

I am mostly pain free and am doing good with a new job, new apartment and am slowly easing back into exercising. But the fact I still think about alcohol and the instant floaty feeling of those painkillers that night in the hospital months ago is why I still see a therapist and check in daily on here.

I have everything good in life. My boyfriend is my best friend, my lover, my champion. Great job, paying me way more than I deserve given that I no longer have any enthusiasm about my job or my life. 

I don't want to get to 40 and still be feeling like this. I'm afraid I'm going to die. 

I'm angry that my Saturday is ruined because I'm hungover. Life is so short, and I'm wasting a weekend. Fuck, I hate myself. 

Anger at society:

I hate that alcohol is legal (No, I don't want Prohibition again, I know what happens).

I hate Mommy wine culture, and I'm not even a mom. I hate how much American culture is geared toward worshipping alcohol. 

But this Anger is misdirected, because truly I'm just angriest with myself. All this wasted time and opportunity. I know what my life can be without alcohol. Why is the alcohol more important?

I have already posted this on another support sub but I figured I would try and find more insight on the subject or just take in some general thoughts.

I have my first real vacation (heading to the town I grew up in) since I quit drinking. The first one where I will be without my S/O, away from home and meeting up with friends I haven't seen in 2 plus years. everyone knows of my sobriety and they all support me. I plan on going into this not wanting to drink and with a general plan of how to get myself out of the situations if they arise. Unfortunately there is still a little part of me that thinks if I end up drinking once it wont be that bad.

I have mentioned this to my group and have talked about the possibilities of where it could lead if I decide to get my toes wet. I have also been reassured that regardless of what I do, that when I go back to my group they are all there to support me, which is incredibly reassuring. I don't plan on failing, but if I do I know everyone around me that has supported me thus far will still be there.

Part of me wants to get my toes wet, because after a year its hard to remember what it was like. I look back fondly on the times I drank with my friends from home but I also see the progress I have made without drinking this past year. I feel frustrated that if I drink I know I will feel ashamed and disappointed regardless of how it turns out. I feel ever so slightly that maybe I can do it just this once. I hit my year and don't have any desire to drink in my day to day life anymore. Maybe I deserve this, maybe it will turn out to be fun, maybe it wont. Maybe it will be hell on earth. Perhaps I'll blackout and send embarrassing texts like I used to. Maybe I will be so hungover that I lose a day or two of my already short vacation or maybe I'll get drunk and cheat on partner. Maybe, maybe and more maybes of varying degrees.

What I am trying to get at is that even at this point in my sobriety my brain is still fighting with itself. The last couple of months it has been quiet, but the addict inside of my brain has decided to come out and fill my head with these thoughts. I think going into this with a well defined goal of not drinking and a plan of what to do if I start having cravings is the best I can do. I know I will be proud of myself if and when I achieve my goal. And if I don't, I know that all my sobriety does not get erased. I worked damn hard for it and no one can take that away.

My only hold up has been I am afraid that it will negatively impact my job because it revolves around alcohol. Not in the sense that I won't be able to control myself, but in the sense that I need to know what different alcohols taste like and understand their quality.

I've gained a bunch of weight from comfort eating through the harder days, but my eyes look clearer and brighter, my hair and skin are healthier, and the mental fog is gone. I'm present and alert, my work performance has improved enormously, my relationship has grown and deepened to the point that we're actively planning our future together, my friendships are thriving now that I'm not isolating myself 99% of the time, and most importantly, I'm not living in a hell of endless shame. I'm not secretly planning, hiding, sneaking, faking. I don't have to hide bottles. I don't have to cover my breath so nobody smells it on me. I don't have to keep making excuses to run to my car at work so I can sneak another swig. I don't have to worry about what I said or posted yesterday because I wasn't impaired when I said it. I don't have to throw up in the morning before work and hope my boyfriend doesn't hear. And my confidence has grown enormously with that burden gone, even with the weight gain. I know 90 days isn't far into sobriety but I'm so, so proud that I'm doing it for real, for myself, finally!!

I came onto this sub and kept reading about people saying how dangerous cold turkey is, and done some research and realised it for myself. I‚Äôve been heavy drinking for about 4 years, i‚Äôd say on average a couple of litres of vodka or gin a week, or about 8 bottles of wine a week if I was going through a wine phase.

I have serious health anxiety (I know it‚Äôs ironic but it‚Äôs almost like I suppressed the thought of how much damage this was doing to me because I was so reliant on alcohol and not ready to let it go). But today reading all these stories of different diseases related to alcoholism, along with the very dangerous process of going cold turkey, has really scared me and I‚Äôm going to a dark place with my thoughts.

How likely is it I can recover from this? I‚Äôve never felt more determined than I have now. I‚Äôd really just like some reassurance or something, or some positive stories of people who have turned their life around after years of heavy drinking.

My wife left me, my business is dead, and I‚Äôm struggling every single day. Honestly I tried my hardest to not go back to alcohol but it was all too much for me. The sheer loneliness of not having my family together almost did me in a few times. It started slow with a beer or two and quickly became a daily habit. Drinking alone proved to be a terrible idea as my negative thoughts almost became actions on numerous occasions. I don‚Äôt have many people to turn to anymore because of the divorce. I do have a few close friends and family members but they don‚Äôt know what to say to me anymore and I think they are tired of hearing about it. Because of this, I started going out to bars just so I could be around people and maybe, just maybe, be able to have a fun conversation or two. The amount of money spent was ridiculous. I did meet some new friends and even ran into a few people from my past. The hole in my heart was still there and it causes daily problems. I just feel incomplete without my wife and son living with me. I have him a few days a week but it‚Äôs not enough. Stopping drinking has to happen, not just for my son and future relationships, but also primarily for myself. I have a problem and I want to get better. My life cannot revolve around drinking again.

But I continued on my sober journey and immediately had employment lined up for myself. So no extra stress right? Nope! Wrong. Dead wrong. The place was so toxic and unprofessional. For months I stayed, I don't know why. And it just kept interfering with my sobriety. Yesterday I told my boss it was my last day and literally a weight has been lifted. I'm on day 12 now and I just can't let anything come in the way of this. It is so important to me. My mental health is more important than a job. I decided to look for something else this week and the very next day I got an email for an interview. This is a job in the field I want to work in. So a positive direction. Hooray! I have a vacation lined up in a week and a half and I get to see my best friends!! But of course, today my husband and I's vehicle shit the bed and we are left trying to figure this out. I am so grateful to be sober during this and not hungover or sleeping through it.

Excuse the length of this post, but I owe such a huge part of my success in recovery to others here who were vulnerable/brave enough to share their own stories and feel compelled to pay it forward. My honest hope is that it, or the song, or both can reach at least one person out there who's going through it. If it's you, if you're reading this, just know that it's okay and you are worth it. I promise you.

Alcohol has always been part of my life. My parents were never the ""serious"" kind of alcoholic, just heavy binge drinkers (especially dad). But alcohol was always viewed as a necessary part of life‚Äîone (or two, or ten...) of the few things we had to look forward to at the end of a long, hard day. 

I had my first binge-drinking episode in 8th grade. In high school, I started drinking more and using other drugs. I college, I blacked out almost every time I drank, which was often, but somehow I managed to keep on top of my grades and my double major. ""work hard, play hard,"" no harm no foul right? As long as it looked like I had my shit together on the outside, I was allowed to destroy myself inside (and destroy my relationship with my SO in the meantime). 

I continued drinking after graduation, and even secured a remote job so I could hide the hangovers. Started to heal things between my SO and figured ""all is forgiven now, I'm older and wiser, surely I can just moderate this,"" and I did! But as well all know that only lasts so long. For years, I would cycle through phases of getting drunk every night to ""enjoying"" a beer once or twice a week, but inevitably I always ended up in the gutter somehow, someway, and it was always so, so dark. I don't know about you all, but the way hangovers interact with my depression-prone brain was /intense/. Keep in mind that on the outside, I seemed perfectly successful and healthy and well, giving 110% to everything else so I could justify my addiction.

Finally, about 2 years ago after downing a bottle of wine and a 9% beer on a work day and getting into yet another stupid, pointless argument with my SO, I just realized it wasn't worth it.

&#x200B;

It's just. not. worth it.

&#x200B;

I was *never* closer to the person I wanted to be while I was drinking. I just *thought* I was getting closer to how I wanted to feel. 

The thing is, feelings come and go. We can't actually control them, no matter how desperately we want to. We can notice them, watch them, comfort and process them...but we can't control them, not really. 

So 2 years ago, I gave it up, and I started feeling my feelings. And I made an album about it. A whole **visual** album‚Äîsomething I never would have dreamed I could do while I was drinking/using. It has made me so much stronger and calmer, and more present to it all. I'm not afraid of my feelings anymore, I work with them and I see what they have to teach me, and I sit with the itch when it comes (which it does). 

You absolutely can do this. And if you already have/are, GOOD FUCKING JOB. It isn't easy! But it is such joyful work. I'm so incredibly grateful for my sobriety and for you fine people of this community.

But after checking in this morning I feel compelled to share something that I hope will help everyone battling with their Day 1s, or Day 4s, or their first weeks: Keep fucking trying. Never give up. Because the further I get into my sobriety journey, the easier it gets.

For context, I am a 20-year drinker. Ten years ago I realized alcohol was at the root of all my problems. About five or so years ago I casually began trying to cut back, or go extended stretches sober‚Äîit never worked, because there was always an excuse to keep drinking, or kick the can further down the road.

Two years ago I had my personal ""rock bottom"" moment. I'll spare you the gory details for now (I'm planning on writing a book about it), but let's just say that wasn't the panacea either. I kept drinking, and when the pandemic hit last year I sloshed my way through those first terrible months drinking more than I ever had before.

I know how terrifying Day 1 is. I know how real the anxiety is, because I've had dozens of Day 1s along this journey. I know how heavy the weight on your shoulders feels when you're staring down a lifetime of not drinking, ever again‚Äîthe birthday parties, the fancy dinners, the work get-togethers, the sporting events, the concerts‚Äîit all just feels impossible. But holy shit my dudes‚Äîit's possible, and it's fucking LIBERATING.

Earlier this year something clicked for me. Through some intense meditation, journalling, therapy and determination, I turned my Day 1 into 30 days free of alcohol. Then I flipped that into 55. After some field research gone awry coupled with a very bad breakup, I fell off the wagon. But the experience was valuable, because now I know how not-worth-it that is.

Last month I kicked it all again, and this time feels different‚Äîyet again. Waking up this morning, on Day 27 without alcohol, I realized I hadn't picked up my sober journal in awhile. When I first started making progress earlier this year, I was writing in it daily, documenting every craving, every setback, every win and every loss. This morning I realized I've only written one entry in the last three weeks.

Because (and this is the point I've been trying to get to with this drawn out post, I promise): It got easier. I hardly think about drinking at all anymore. I don't have any urge to go to the liquor store after work. I don't have to manage intense cravings. I don't feel sad or sorry for myself that I HAVE to give up alcohol. Now I am just over the moon that I GET to live the rest of my life free of that horrible fucking poison. I know the work isn't done, and there's always a possibility of sliding back down the slippery slope. But I've endured enough trial and error at this point to know how to navigate the darkness.

So, all of that to say, don't give up. You got this, no matter how hopeless it might feel sometimes. It might be Day 1 today, or Day 0. But every day offers a new shot at redemption, so long as you keep fighting. And you will, because you're here.

I‚Äôve been on such a rewarding journey since and figured I‚Äôd share some pointers/observations. If today is your Day 1, or the Nth time you‚Äôve tried to stop, hopefully this perspective helps.
  
**Long Term Effects**

-	**Sleep** - it‚Äôs truly amazing how much sleep improves after about the 90 day mark. I have restorative sleep almost every night unless it‚Äôs a really warm summer night. I wake up ready to go, and even though I can dread having to get up and work, I am mentally clear and can usually reflect on a vivid dream.


-	**Physical Health** - I channeled a lot of cravings and frustrations into exercise, and it‚Äôs had tremendous effects on the shape I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm in the best shape of my life now, but cutting out alcohol was the major key here. My gut health has improved so much, and GI issues that I used to think were a chronic issue have settled down now that alcohol is out of the picture. I am often told that my skin is glowing - which is a flattering/rare compliment to receive for me.


-	**Relationships/Trust** - I have been in a relationship with my partner for almost 8 years now, and some of our lowest points came from my inability to control my drinking. I would make up so many ‚Äúwhite‚Äù lies to get away with excessive drinking, and I would reconcile this with the fact that I wasn‚Äôt cheating or rude or abusive‚Ä¶and that was enough. How wrong was I. By the time I came clean with my partner, it was clear how much trust I had eroded with her due to my drinking. Now that I‚Äôve been so steadfast in my sobriety, that trust has been restored - and it‚Äôs opened our relationship up to new levels. We are SO open and vulnerable with each other now. And the feeling you get when you realize somebody out there really knows you, your flaws, everything‚Ä¶and they still love you. It‚Äôs priceless.


-	**Socializing** - I perceived socializing - and the potential damage to my social life - as the biggest challenge I‚Äôd face in my sobriety journey. In reality, it hasn‚Äôt been that bad. We underestimate how accepting people can be. And a simple and confident ‚Äúno thanks, I don‚Äôt drink‚Äù can diffuse many situations where you‚Äôre feeling indirect pressures. Now I‚Äôm a reliable friend who always has a new type of NA beverage to show off at the party. People are rarely nosy about why I decided to stop drinking - if anything they‚Äôre interested in the benefits, and love hearing your perspective. I can still get silly with friends, and ride the same energy the party has‚Ä¶just without needing alcohol. The only situation that I‚Äôm still not a fan of is bars - they can just be hit or miss. My go to is to order a tonic and lime or an NA beer if they have it, but options can be limited and sometimes bartenders can give you a hard time or ignore you after they realize you won‚Äôt be running up the tab with cocktails. 


-	**Finances** - One thing I quickly realized during my first several months sober, and during previous attempts, is that my addictive tendencies aren‚Äôt limited to just alcohol. I like small rewards; and the dopamine rush of little purchases. In my first few months, I barely saved money on not buying booze because I was replacing that with Amazon purchases, chasing new hobbies, and buying a little more sweets at the grocery store. This has definitely settled down since but I realized that all of these capricious purchases are so much better than a six pack on a Tuesday evening after work. Give yourself the time and space to find ways to fill the ‚Äúgap‚Äù sobriety brings to your life. Start a new hobby, buy some new clothes, maybe get some higher quality ingredients for your next meal. You deserve to treat yourself and your body well - especially when embarking on a journey like not drinking. Obviously, keep this in check and don‚Äôt go beyond your means, but understand that small rewards to yourself can be a great way to keep cravings away and ways to build new things in your life to replace drinking.

Anyways‚Ä¶just some thoughts on how the process has been so far. I am so thankful for this community, and I‚Äôm always happy to share more and listen if anyone needs support. We‚Äôre all in this together, and we become a family in many ways through this common enemy we fight. Sending love and positive vibes into the weekend! IWNDWYT",22,0

I've written this multiple times now, but I'm just going to keep saying it - I remember my last night of drinking so clearly, I so clearly remember crying and telling my Husband that there was no way that I was going to be able to quit drinking. I had said weeks before  that I would quit before the ball dropped, on New Year's Eve going into 2020, and a few hours before it hit me like a ton of bricks, that it was going to be time for me to make good on what I had said - I just started crying and my Husband told me to ""just try"". So I did. 

I tried that first month, and when his parents came to visit from out of town, his parents that I loved to drink with - I tried. I tried in March, when we went to Hawaii for my 40th birthday on March 6th, and for the week+ that we were on a tropical island for the first time. I tried when we got back and a pandemic struck the next week, that would render me without a job for over 2 months. I tried alone at home all day for those 2+ months, while my Husband worked, and I was stuck in an apartment with a new neighbor below us that made constant ridiculous noise from morning until night. I tried when we moved a few months later, to a state that we'd never been to, on the other side of the country where neither of us knew a single person. I tried in this new town, where I couldn't find a job for a couple more months, because of the ongoing pandemic. I tried throughout anniversaries of both of my parents deaths, on holidays, and I tried on the mundane days that weren't significant in any other way except for just testing me in their own rights. And every single one of those times - I did it. I didn't drink. And I won't today either. I want people to know that it's ok to be scared, though. I know that I was. It was worth trying, though. I'm still trying. Some days more than others. But - it does make me really proud of my almost 600 Days. 

I hope that just one single person reads this, and decides to at least try. IWNDWYT",862,2

My eyes lazily scan my surroundings to see where i‚Äôve ended up. My room. Thank god.

I then have a moment of panic and slowly stretch my arm across the width of the bed. Phew. I am the only body here. 

After asserting these two basic facts my brain starts to recount what the hell happened last night. A mental game of detective work I start to re-trace my memories. One drink. Two drinks. Shots. Shots for the whole group. Shots for the strangers/ my new best friends‚Ä¶ I groan as I picture my bank account, but I quickly push that thought to the bottom of the priority list for now. 

I roll my body over to check my almost dead phone - of course I forgot to plug it in to charge. As I roll, the fluids in my skull seem to slosh around and my brain feels like it‚Äôs constantly plummeting into the pillow from dizziness. 

My heart quickens as I prepare myself for the worst - my notifications. A breath of short sharp regret leaves my lips as I briefly sweep the list. Snapchat. Facebook. Instagram. Tinder. Text messages and finally, a facetime. 

‚ÄòTxt me when ur home plz!!‚Äô

‚ÄòHey you‚Ä¶ thanks for last night, was a blast ;)‚Äô

‚ÄòSomeone clearly had a good night. Long time no talk.‚Äô

My stomach sinks and I yearn to be consumed by my mattress, swallowed up whole and never to be seen again. The shame, guilt and embarrassment creeps in like a silent assassin. 

I attempt to escape these thoughts by sitting up which I instantly regret. Almost as soon as I sit up do I collapse again. My lurching stomach, pounding headache and vertigo are too much to bear in an upright position.

So I wither away for another few hours, drifting in and out of sleep with netflix providing a background soundscape to my hungover state. 

I make promises to never drink again. Usually the allure of next Friday night would break these promises, but this time is different.

I have posted here two times, after falling so badly into disspair due to not being able to keep myself sober. Until now I would drink 5-6 L of beer 3 times per week. 15-18 L of fucking beer every single week. And I would just quit drinking and pretend to be sober forever. Obviously I have fallen at every single try. From 15-18 L to 0 is drastic and made my time sober to be a great struggle.

So, in order to avoid that, I have cut for the last two weeks my drinking in a progressive way. From 12 jars of beer to 4. From 4 jars of beer to 2 cans. People believe that I am a different person because I have self control. But I don't want to control It but to quit It forever. I believe that if I stay enough time with a couple of cans of beer, I could downsize It to no cans. Have any of you try this method to remain sober? Or this approach could go in a bad way for me?",4,0

Lately I have been reminding myself of the big/tragic reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt drink (ie. almost dying, hurting my husband, insane hangovers). This morning I want to be thankful for the smaller things.

1. Less bruises. I would drink after work and run into things because I was too loose to notice.

2. I‚Äôm hydrated. I have been drinking soda water cans to replace the beers and I am so hydrated. I can stretch easier and my face isn‚Äôt full of blemishes.

3. Sleeping through the night. I would get up at least 2 times each night up to 6 times to go pee. Now I get up once or not at all. I‚Äôm getting better sleep because of it.

4. I‚Äôm kind. My anxiety has subsided and I am kinder and more patient as a result.

5. Money. Saving it.

So I guess these aren‚Äôt small things at all but to my alcoholic mind they seem smaller than the ‚Äúyets‚Äù (well I haven‚Äôt done that yet-used as a comparison when you hear other alcoholics stories). I‚Äôve got to be stronger than the obsession and daily reminders are helpful.

It feels like that has shifted in sobriety. In the beginning, I was sleeping more, 8+ or 9+ hours. I suspect my body was healing.

But for the past week or so, I've woken up naturally after about 6h45m. It has been pretty consistent; when 6h45m have passed since I fell asleep, I find myself completely awake with my brain and body raring to go.

At first, I found this slightly alarming, like a sign that something is off. But now I'm reflecting on the fact that I feel completely rested and haven't been getting tired until 9ish (when I go to bed). My body doesn't *feel* like it needs more sleep than this.

Is it possible that my body's baseline need is less than I thought it was when I was drinking? Has anyone else experienced something like this?

For  background, Lockdowns in Australia started me on the drinking pretty heavily mid last year. What started as a 6 pack every couple nights, has turned into 12+ beers a night, drinking at 9AM if anything is left over, sometimes even a full body of whiskey on my balcony. Basically, the other night I drank 12 beers, got super emotional, came down stairs to sad eat cool ranch Doritos, couldn't open the salsa, and passed out. It basically sent me on a spiral, realising I'm not leaving the house, I don't know how to be comfortable not drunk, and none of my clothes truly actually fit. So I've decided to stop fully for the meantime, for as long as it takes for me to get to a point where I can be comfortable without it and maybe, MAYBE Enjoy a few with friends in the future without going overboard. 

I'm now on day 4, and the withdrawals are starting to hit. I'm fidgety, cold, being not drunk for this long for the first time in over a year is starting to feel very freaking weird. I feel a large amount of stress and there's so much time left in the night that I have no urge to fill with anything but alcohol. I went on a two hour walk today, did kettlebell swings, made coffee, even sat on a bench and drank a pepsi Max. But still I can't stay distracted. 

Sorry for the longwind, but have you found non alcoholic beer to be beneficial in these times? I'm highly considering going to get a few and just listening to a podcast on my roof or something, but have seen some mixed anecdotes. Thanks for your time!",3,1

100% of the time your life will improve. I've virtually never heard someone say their life was worse off without alcohol / substance abuse.

Adversities might seem tough at first but that's only because you're finally facing your problems head on without the bottle. For some of us, maybe even the first time in our adult life. It can be challenging to deal with these issues &  feelings at first but for me, in hindsight, my choices and recovery time for dealing with my  problems are always better, faster, & less damaging than trying to run away and hide behind substance abuse.

I've spent a few years myself on this thread. I made a few desperation posts to try and convince myself to stop.

I even wrote in Sharpe across my bedroom wall my quit date a couple years ago. It was pretty sad when I started using again with that date written there lol.

I just turned 27 and I was addicted to drinking & cocaine use. I would stay up for sometimes, 3 days and blast a couple balls, pop shit, & snort weird research chemicals lol. I worked for myself so I could deal with the blast radius of derailing my week.  The first time I tried to quit was when i was 24 a week before new years.

It's a difficult transition from partying to trying to stay sober. I failed 3 times before this last quit date (which has been my longest by 7 months). 

It gets easier everytime you quit.

But everytime you go back it also gets worse. 

The last time I went back I blew through 10 grand of savings in a month and a half. Lol, I seriously dont plan on going back. 

I've mostly found joy in work and the mundane things in life. I enjoy Monday's now. I love getting up and having coffee. I love spending the remaining time I have left with my grandma. Fuck, golden girls are actually funny as hell! The little boring things become fun again. It kinda' reminds me of being a kid (idk maybe someone else can relate)

Ever remember getting those pesky morning phone calls when you havent slept yet? I do.. 

How many work calls I'd dodge blows my mind. Going to meetings without sleeping through the week. It gives me chills.

What I've really come to learn is those missed phone calls are all opportunities I lost. New deals, girls, a good buddy. Who knows. One thing leads to another, right?

Last year (on a sober saturday morning) i lent a hand to my neighbor. Said he would toss me 40 bucks for helpin him move some stuff. Drove out, dropped his stuff off & while I was there his other friend met up. Had some common interests, hit it off, & gave him my card. He called a couple days later. Seriously changed my life. All from not wasting my saturday boozed out on hey y'alls & smokin darts. I'm not the best at explaining myself but the point I'm trying to make is: stop missing opportunities.

I thought I was an emotional person before but now I'm realizing now that I'm sober is that I always scratch the surface level of my emotions before.

I'm just so upset tonight because Covid is so awful in my state am I just feel so utterly trapped and alone. I'm in Texas, and basically what's happening here is that medical system is basically collapsing in real time and no one seems to give a shit.

The first time we were in lockdown, I lived with my ex but we broke up about four months ago. So this time I'm all by myself most of the day and most of the night.

I hate it here in this stupid state. I went out, I want to go home. But I feel so trapped. My flight or fight response feels like it's in constant play.

Last Sunday was different, I woke up feeling hungover as usual but then in the afternoon my heart started racing/pounding, and I felt like I was hyperventilating, after a few hours of what I assumed was the worst panic attack of my life, I finally went to the ER.

By the time I was seen by a doctor my symptoms had mostly gone away. I mentioned drinking the night before but the doctor didn't make any connection to the alcohol.

Either way, I still keep getting these panic attacks where I feel like I can't breathe or that I'm breathing too much. Decided to drink again, only a fifth and a pint with my wife, on Wednesday. Thursday, started getting withdrawal symptoms, so we drank a fifth. Felt better today and decided to just try to keep tapering down. So my wife and I shared 2 bottles of wine instead of whiskey.

I hope I don't sound like a complete moron, but I can't handle the anxiety/panic when I start to feel like I can't breathe.. so I'm thinking that slowly tapering off over the next week might be my safest bet to quit.

I don't really like marijuana, but now my wife and I are going to get high on weed after drinking our ""prescribed"" amount. We smoked after the 2 bottles of wine today and I was so uncomfortably fucked up that I had to go lay down.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Do you believe that some things are meant to be?

I don‚Äôt. Or mostly I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt believe there was a purpose to the things I experienced in life, or even my genetic variant, that made me susceptible to alcohol, or all the things that followed from it. I don‚Äôt think events in themselves are ¬´meant to be¬ª in a cosmic or quasi-religious sense, whether it¬¥s random (mis)fortune or necessary consequence, but I do believe that I can give meaning to the things that happened and how it became.

This is a super power. I can take my hurt and inject a secret formula and zap, boom, kapow, it becomes a strenght. A shield against attacks. X-ray vision to see the truth. An outreached hand to help others. I have gone so deep that I don‚Äôt fear the dark anymore, but can go there again to pull someone up.

It wasn‚Äôt always like this. I used to think that I was trapped in misery and that I would never be able to break free. There was a time when I simply didn‚Äôt have hope, didn‚Äôt see any light. Then came sobriety, the secret formula, like the slow morning sun, and a new landscape appeared, and with it a new identity to explore and develop. And that this could even happen, well, that is because a caped crusader from the Sobernauts reached out to me and showed me the way.

Okay there is *one* thing that was simply meant to be. That is me on a whim taking a different street home yesterday, and by pure cosmic coincidence discovering [this rare artifact](https://imgur.com/a/damaqjM) in a shop window. This is my superhero to the right, and his evil twin to the left. I am SaintHomer and *I - am - sober.*

I hit several rock bottoms during the past week. Boyfriend almost left me last week after blowing my final chance (ultimatum if you will) but decided to give me ONE last chance. 

We did separate for a few days so he could have space. I stayed with my parents who were surprisingly supportive and hid all the alcohol from me. When I told them my boyfriend and I might split, they immediately asked, ""Because of your drinking?"" So it's been a well-known problem everyone was aware of except ME. I've been in denial about the pain I've been causing. I also have a soon-to-be 3-year-old daughter to think about and set a good example for. 

Then on Sunday I ended up in the hospital with a severely inflamed gallbladder and gallstones. One stone was blocking the duct so I required emergency surgery. I was hospitalized for almost 2 days and due to the new covid surge, I wasn't able to get a room nor have any visitors. So I was stuck in the E.R. with no TV or company, which was like an unofficial in-patient rehab. Me being alone with my thoughts really helped me self-reflect. 

Thankfully the surgery went well and I'm currently recovering. I was granted 2 weeks off work. The doctors gave me fluids to detox, and I had a doctor sit and chat with me about my alcohol use and told me flat-out if I keep going the way I am, I will surely have liver failure and / or liver cancer by age 40 (I'm 27). That was an eye-opener for me. I have a loving partner and amazing daughter that I want to live for, be healthy for, set a good example...drinking is just not worth it. I find myself not even craving it, which is a good start. I've tried to quit before but was always on edge waiting for the next opportunity to drink. 

My boyfriend has been supportive and keeps telling me he's proud of how strong I'm being, but I can see the doubt and fear in his eyes. I know it'll take awhile to regain his trust and respect. But it'll be all so worth it. I feel this all happened for a reason. Me deciding to quit and then being hospitalized immediately after just sealed the deal. It's not just about our relationship anymore, but my health is also on the line. We only get one life and we all get the promise of death. Whether I die tomorrow or in 60 years, I want it to be due to something that was OUT of my control. In the meantime, I want to enjoy the ride and not waste it.

Had a couple of alcohol cravings but knew it was out of the question.  Both of my close friends, who don't really know eachother, (I only have two real friends) have been struggling with some traumatic experiences of their own the last couple days. 

I haven't really had anyone to talk to or reassure me that I've got this. I've briefly felt the scary feeling of being completely alone in the world (I barely talk to my family for other complicated reasons. I live across the country from them. Also I was adopted.) This is the first time I've been single in my adult life and lived alone (I'm 25). 

I'm realizing I need to figure out how to make friends, sober, while working 60 hours a week. I can't live in solitude. I've spent 6 years completely invested in my relationships with one guy then another, I completely blockaded from the world. Intoxicated for all but 2 years. 

This is a very wierd feeling but I know that means positive change and growth is coming. The only thing that can stop that change is a drink. I'm not giving up.

I knew some specialty something or other was going to come out for everyone one to taste. 

I was poured a glass which I knew would happen. I cheered with every one. But I didn't take a sip. I didn't feel tempted. Nothing. I just put the glass down and carried one with our wonderful evening.

I made it through live music at a caf√© alcohol free. 2 weeks ago I went there on what was supposed to be my day 1 thinking they didn't serve alcohol and it was a safe option. I was wrong and day 1 became day 0 after I had a couple of beers there then stopped for a 6 pack on the way home. This time I was prepared for the temptation which is what made the difference I think and I made it through sober.

Next week I have a 4 day weekend at the beach with 2 friends. Neither are huge drinkers but I know they'll both be drinking some and they might want to go out and let loose one night. Also, sharing a small condo for that long will be hard on me as an intovert who loves her personal space, I normally use alcohol to dull that if I'm feeling overwhelmed...

 So I won't lie, I am feeling  little anxious about this weekend. For the next 5 days, I'm going to my best friend's cottage that I go to every year. It's beautiful, large and on an island... he actually held his wedding there so it can really accommodate people.

Usually I spend the whole weekend hammered. But this time I am showing up differently. I made the decision to stop drinking five months ago and this is the first real test I've experienced in a while. I'm going to rise to the challenge.

My friends will mostly be drinking but they are aware I have taken this step. I have faith they will be supportive. I have two friends that I know won't be drinking but they have never been big drinkers. I really cherish my friends and am so happy to see them.

My boyfriend will also be there and he will be drinking, but he never pressures me to drink. It would be nice if he didn't but I don't want to pressure him into making a change he doesn't want to make. I kind of doubt he will ever quit but if he does I want it to be of his own volition.

Even though I am nervous as hell, I am also excited. I get to be fully present with my friends, I get to enjoy mornings, I get to remember the whole weekend, and I get to prove to myself that I can do this.

I'll probably be checking in a lot with you all this weekend, this is just my first one. Please wish me luck!

WTF, why now?","I'm on Day 5, and it's a Friday. I've been doing good. Made it a whole 5 days and I don't plan on breaking my streak tonight. I'm going to bed early and being productive tomorrow. 

Tomorrow, my apartment complex is offering a free brunch with mimosas. They don't skimp, either. This is going to be tough on me. 

Sunday night, a random girl from a friend of a friend (who is pretty cute), asked me out on a date to a bar/brewery. 

I don't know what I am going to do. I will have FOMO for the date. I'm not nearly as worried about free mimosas. 

On the flip side, I went on a completely sober date today. Probably the first time in forever. It went pretty well, too. I've been out of the dating scene for 9 years and I feel like I am just now figuring this part out. Except for the whole drinking thing during the dates. 

I don't want to tell the girl I am not drinking. I'm not even sure if I am telling myself I am not drinking. I just like my streak and don't want to reset the clock, especially on a Saturday. If I broke the streak today, I could forgive myself as long as I didn't partake Sunday and have a shitty Monday workday. 

I'm rambling now. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I know there will be more opportunities and I am making a project out of this date. In fact, if I can't tell her I'm not interested in drinking, maybe I don't want to go on this date, anyway.

However, there is a very addictive and dangerous side to it. There are reminder signs and hotline numbers at every turn. When I go, I do not drink but did in the past. I don‚Äôt associate the two, even though there are bars all over and cocktail servers begging to give people free alcohol and if in Vegas, drunk tourists.

Today, I went to the casino with my husband for a couple hours. We played a little, had some lunch and came home. It was a beautiful day and the drive was nice.

When I got sober during the end of our relationship, everything went downhill from there. I immediately realized that I didn‚Äôt love her, but I stuck around for some reason. I stayed for the sex, for the intimacy, and I guess a big part of it was just to be in a relationship. 

Now I‚Äôm sober still, and I keep craving sex and I keep thinking about her. The breakup was abrupt and messy, and I‚Äôve been really bitter about it, too. I‚Äôve been craving alcohol for the first time since the first two months of sobriety.

All I do and all that I‚Äôve been doing is what I love, and that‚Äôs running 50-60km a week and weightlifting. But the other day I was driving home from the gym and I saw the same make model and colour car she has and I had to pull over. 

I have a sex addiction, recently diagnosed but I really didn‚Äôt need a diagnosis to realize that something was problematic. I had planned on ending things with her throughout the entire relationship because she was toxic and I felt uncomfortable being around her. I stayed for the sex, and back then I was drinking everyday. 

Now I‚Äôm sitting in this empty house fantasizing an alcoholic beverage. I honestly feel like I will never love anyone again. Dating has turned me into a savage. I‚Äôve lost pleasure in my hobbies and work. I‚Äôve been a dick to others around me without even realizing it. 

It‚Äôs bad. I got so mad yesterday that I went on a 15km run in the heat with no water. I honestly thought I was going up to the store to get a drink or something.

I say ""In my experience it's alcohol. I haven't been sad any more after quitting. When I drank I was constantly anxious or sad or both, before during and after drinking"". Then, right after this, others started: ""It's NOT alcohol. It's your bad life choices, missing someone or grief of something else. Booze is lovely, it must be something else"" and ""Alcohol only boosts feelings you had prior drinking, so it must be you"".

Almost a year ago I got out of rehab and was doing great. Was going to meetings, feeling awesome, loving life‚Ä¶for about 4 months. Then I had that first drink. Had one hard seltzer one night and then I thought, ‚ÄúOh, I can do this. I can drink like a normal person.‚Äù Well, long story short, I most definitely can not. 

Honestly, I have found that I‚Äôm even worse than I was ever was before I went to rehab. Pounding shots as soon as I wake up on the weekends, stumbling through the grocery store, can‚Äôt hold a conversation because I‚Äôm always slurring my words. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I‚Äôm 27 years old, and my boyfriend told me he doesn‚Äôt want to bury me before I‚Äôm even 30.

So, I‚Äôm trying again. I‚Äôm on day 5 of my new journey. I feel like I know how this goes‚Ä¶ and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm going to fail. This community was one of the best things when I tried getting sober last year, so I‚Äôm back again for some support. 

I feel like every day I constantly find myself thinking about being sober. Like it‚Äôs on my mind all day, every day. I go the grocery and can‚Äôt look at the wine aisle. Driving on the bypass and BAM there‚Äôs a Bud Lite billboard.. and then I‚Äôm thinking about it again. At work I‚Äôm thinking about how I have to drink water at Happy Hour. My question is will it always be like this? Will I ever stop obsessing over NOT drinking?‚Ä¶Does it ever get better?",24,0

I would often binge heavily on weekends and this is my first Friday sober. I wasn't sure what to expect but I feel like I am crawling out of my skin. I am so bored, nothing is appealing. I keep making plans for myself how to spend time but can't bring myself to start because it just doesn't seem fun and I don't have the patience. I am home alone, but we do have alcohol here because my boyfriend still drinks. Deep down I know I won't touch it but I also have no idea how to get through tonight because it's only late afternoon and I feel like it's been a week. 

Normally on Fridays I do have friends I play with online but they are busy this week, which is just bad timing and nobody's fault. 

I said to myself ""Lets hit a meeting, make dinner and then we can either play solo or take a bath with a face mask and watch movies after"".... But I... Don't want to? I mean what are games without friends and drinks and what's a spa night without some wine? 

I hope the meeting helps but I thought you all might have some advice as well. The first 4 days were challenging but nothing like this. I also need to be prepared for the fact there may be people drinking around me over the weekend and I want to be ready.",11,1

My personal top of the stairs, so far, was having my own apartment, job and car. Thru 30 years of drinking, I lost it all. I fell far down those stairs. 

Almost 2 years ago, I went to rehab. Went up a stair. Then I moved in with my parents, at 47, 140 miles away from my area, my home. No job, no car. Being supported by them. I started schooling for my alcohol and drug counselor credential. Up another few stairs. I finished the class portion in June. Another step. Now I have to move back to my area.

And I really want a place of my own, where I can have my cat. I have the money to cover rent for a few months while I find a job. But I have been struggling. With fear. With uncertainty. With doubt. And getting frozen, overwhelmed. 

And I realized, it was because I was looking too far ahead. Looking up at the top of the stairs. Wanting to just be up there or at least close. Trying to skip several steps.

And while you can sometimes skip a single step, any more than that usually leads to a fall, or at least a stop, while you devote yourself to feverishly looking for a shortcut, some way, any way at all, to get up there, blinded to the reality that the only real way is to aim lower, take the step in front of you and simply climb. 

Like many epiphanies, it all seemed so obvious in retrospect. But I was shook. And so much of my fear was put to rest by getting knocked out by the truth of it, by reality. 

I really want my own place for me and my cat, where I can have guests and decorate as I please and follow no one's rules but my own.

But all I need is a place to live. A place to shower, eat, sleep, keep my stuff and use as a home base near my area so that I can find a job. 

Then I will take the next step from there.

I think I've become so used to associating drinks with relaxtion and the weekend. Most weekends it's just a couple glasses of wine or couple gin and tonics, not enough to even have a hangover but it does make me unmotivated the next day. I had a particularly heavy day of drinking two weeks ago with family that left me with a lot of anxiety the next morning and so I decided I wasn't going to drink for two weeks after to detox. As soon as the next Friday hit though, I was drinking again. I feel like that kind of shows I have a bit of a problem, the fact I couldn't resist the cravings and had to drink even though I said I wouldn't. 

Is there any tips to distract yourself from drinking? My weekends are kind of boring so that doesn't help. It's just me and my boyfriend at home, we don't generally see anyone because of covid.

I just poured out all my alcohol (again).,"I've been drinking since high school, and I'm now 33 years old. I feel like most of my adult life has centered around alcohol. The first time I got drunk in high school, one of the guys camping with us died... It was a horrific experience, and probably would have turned many people off from drinking, yet here I am 15 years later drinking every day and most the time NOT in moderation. Drinking in moderation has been my goal for a while now, as I am wildly uncomfortable with the idea of being with with friends, family, or whoever and not being able to just casually have a drink or two, because in my mind it generally enhances the experience and let's me relax and be myself. This is a byproduct of fairly intense (social) anxiety, I think!

I have lied to myself for years that I will control the amount of alcohol I consume. Time and time again I have proven that I cannot. Last night I went to a co-worker's open mic comedy show hosted at a local brewery. I told myself I would have 3 beers and then head home. I had my 3 at the brewery, but then after the show another girl with us wanted to have an after-party. We went to another bar to play volleyball, where I rationalized with myself that another drink or 2 wouldn't kill me. I ended up having 4-5 more drinks, then driving home. Today I don't feel great - not so much from a hangover but mostly because I wasn't true to myself. This always leads to mentally beating myself up - I'm a failure for not being able to stand by my word, I'm weak, my willpower is shit, etc.

This has happened probably a cool 500 times to me over the past 5 years. I'm a father of an 8 year old boy who is obviously extremely impressionable, and I want to set a good example for him. I wish that example could be moderation, but apparently I can't do that.

The times in the past that I have tried to give up alcohol entirely have led me right back to drinking within a month, but more often than not, a couple of days. I mostly cave into boredom, requests with friends to go out, feelings of existential dread, irritation, and/or my brain rationalizing that 'a few drinks won't kill me, and this time around I'll keep it in moderation.'

I don't like that this has to be an ""all or nothing"" journey for me, but I'm out of options. I didn't plan on pouring out my booze today, but I came across this subreddit and am feeling like this is the right direction to go. Wish me luck, and thanks for letting me vent.",29,0

I am so proud of myself and the healing journey I am on. Does anyone have experience with ADDING things to their lives as they cut things out? I am an active runner, yogi, and consumer of news. But I feel nervous right now about adding things to my life that might replace the instant dopamine of the things I cut out. I feel like my brain is in a state of truly regrowing right now, and I want to help it become emotionally intelligent, confident, and willing to wait for longer rewards. I don't have much in terms of attention span right now. I know that that is a thing that I can ""practice"". I've also recently started meditating which will help with my spiritual journey and attention span. 

I wake up on my days off, though, and actually don't know what to do with all of my time.

I visited my sister and her husband recently, who I haven't seen since my sobriety started. He has gotten into making mead, and we had good conversations about different yeasts and other brewing stuff(I've made a few batches of wine, peach and grape, and still have a cider spiced with cloves and raisins that is just sitting in a five gallon carboy at my house I should just dump out or give away). 

Of course I *had* to try the new mead. The first night I got away with just saying that I was taking a brake from booze. The conversation came again the second night. I though what the heck, I'll swish it get the flavor and spit it into the sink. It was in the evening so I used the excuse that I didn't want it to affect my sleep. 

The regular mead had a slight aftertaste, but he had made a hibiscus style mead that was very smooth. I was worried that tasting alcohol would give me that sensation of relaxation that I used to get after the first drink, the moment that my brain realizes what is about to come. I didn't. Instead, my mouth felt dry after spitting the alcohol into the sink after each sip, and it only remind me of the extremely parched feeling in my mouth in the morning after drinking too much the night before. Success. My brain is recognizing alcohol for what it is. 

I don't have the balls to tell anyone that I'm never drinking again, partly because this addiction is strong, and I don't know that I can stave off forever. But today, I'm not drinking. Thanks for your support. I couldn't have done it without this sub and finding solidarity in all of you.

I‚Äôm a grown woman and I had an event I internally called ‚ÄúMy Special Sober Night.‚Äù And it fucking worked.

Picture if you will an exhausted woman in professional attire, heels clicking on the linoleum floor of a busy Target, angrily filling a cart with items appropriate for a child‚Äôs birthday party. Candy, chips, a coloring book, soda, a pink plastic serving bowl, etc. She then marches up to the cash register, loads it onto the conveyor, charges it to a credit card, and stuffs it all in her car while looking like she‚Äôd rather drive off a cliff. That was me. The cravings hit while I was in the car (a familiar feeling from when I quit smoking which made them easy to recognize) but no stopping at the liquor store, it‚Äôs party time!

I changed into my pajamas, made myself a beautiful mocktail with lime and sugar on the rim, filled the pink bowl with chips and a little dish of salsa in the center, and settled in to‚Ä¶not drink. I watched videos, I ate a ridiculous number of chips and half a bag of peach gummies, at one point I made myself an egg sandwich out of pure boredom. All evening I watched for whispers of my alcoholism like a monster under the bed, deliberately keeping my mind on snacks and games. At 8:30 I took some melatonin, magnesium, and half a Benadryl to slowly convince my body to get tired, and somehow by 10:00pm I decided to turn off the tv and close my eyes.

I woke up in the dark and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of crushing chest pain and tried to get back to sleep. I tossed and turned as usual, but after about 20 minutes I heard something: my alarm clock. My alarm clock? WHAT?! You‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs not 2:00am?! I slept an entire night! I don‚Äôt feel like puking, I‚Äôm not violently thirsty, and I slept until 5:45am. Holy shit.

I took a shower and went to work feeling like I just woke up with secret superpowers a la Peter Parker. Do normal people feel like this all the time? Lucky bastards. Look at them,  ungrateful for the miracle of sleep bestowed upon them each night. Well I‚Äôm going to join the land of the living now, so watch out! The best is yet to come!

And that‚Äôs the story of how I got my first night of sobriety in years by treating myself like an 11-year-old girl.

That I'll be quieter, and less engaged while my anxiety takes the wheel. You see, when I was younger I was pretty damn socially awkward and it wasn't until my very late teens and when I discovered alcohol that I found I could loosen up enough to socialize with (a bit more) ease. So what if I go to a thing stone cold sober and stand there all awkward like I did when I was a kid?

One catch is that I do very little socializing now (as in, next to none) so the risk here is minimal - at least in the near term. Another is that I'm not in any way who I was when I was that awkward kid. My brain wasn't at all done cooking.  

The biggest catch: While I fear this somehow inferior me I fail to focus on the fact that I may benefit greatly (read: I definitely will) by not being sloshed at these mixers. I mean, am I really a better version of myself when I'm loud and obnoxious? When I'm argumentative and slurring and confused? If all I needed was one drink to loosen up and was able to put the brakes on that'd be one thing, but how often do I stick to one drink? Ummm...never?   

So what the hell am I afraid of? NOT being (as much of) an asshole?

Hopefully my ramblings go somewhere this time.  Anyways, here we go.  Three years seem to have gone by quickly, but if I take the time and really think about it, many new memories, friendships, and activities have changed during that time.  I've redefined myself.  That was never my intention but that has happened.  New people I meet see me as a person that loves to take on new challenges, learn new skills, explore this great world.  Friends and family that knew me before this change have also adapted to this person I've molded into.  In the same way alcohol made me this one guy, removing it made me another.  So I know this probably reads as the typical, ""I quit drinking and now everything is great, I'm running double marathons and climbing Mount Everest, all thanks to dropping the poison"", but I'm trying to say that that naturally happened for me without forcing it.  Granted in the first year, I was forcing myself to find happiness without it.  Adopting things like coffee and candy as my new escape.  Going for a walk to achieve the high that alcohol gave.  Playing the guitar or taking an intense fitness class to reward my brain the same way the tall juicebomb ipa used to.  But a funny thing happened during this time.   The reason I know that 3 years is a long time.  Eventually these things I was doing to maintain happiness started to become me.  I became that guy.  It wasn't forced.  It wasn't an escape, it was simply me just trying to be me.  I've giving this serious thought thru these 3 years and I realize for me, that when you don't have the immediate escape that alcohol provides, the immediate reward, I needed to find my own.  That thrill seeking which exist in everyday life that doesn't come in a bottle or can, is out there for me and I know now what it takes to go find it.  I'm a busy guy.  Father of 3, kids are crazy and they take so much of your time, but without alcohol I've found that there is more time in the week I just need to make it.  Making time starts to add up, and before I knew it, I have accumulated 3 years of alcohol free memories.  Positive happy memories that exist in reality and are not romanticized chemical fantasies.

I thought that my hardest day was behind me when I lost my mom. I thought that my family would rebuild after losing the ""glue"" that kept us all hanging out. I really thought after I got through my mom's passing, the only court date I've ever had, and a really ugly breakup, that I could handle anything. I have 5 months under my belt as of yesterday, and I want to drink so fucking bad today, even just one as a libation to my dad, but I know I don't have that ability.

Background:
Wonderful, loving childhood. But my mom is a recovering (what I now identify as a) functioning alcoholic. Older brother is an alcoholic, sister is also an alcoholic. Other sister is off i her own world. Other other sister only drinks on occasion. Dad drinks every night, plentiful. (but no abuse in the home at all). 

I HATED seeing my mum drunk when I was little. Even though she was being 'fun and friendly'. To me as a little kid it was weird. And that is why she stopped. She hated hurting us. She's relapsed a few times but still 95% of the time as far as I know is teetotal. I've witnessed my alcoholic brother and sister attempt suicide between them both well over 5 times.

I hated it so much I never touched alcohol at my family home and could never bear becoming one of them.

However, I've found myself relying on alcohol more and more. I look forward to go to sleep so I can wake up and around midday open the bottle of wine. I will easily drink 2 bottles of wine through the afternoon and then drink bottles of beer and still have a coherent conversation with my partner (who rarely rarely drinks). I will happily miss any meals as I don't have hunger when I've had just 2 drinks.

I've become so content with the label ""functioning alcoholic"" that I just wasn't seeing the issue with the fact I can easily consume 3 bottles of wine, missing 2 meals or just going a full day without eating and not caring. I will still go to work at 6.30am no problem (probably drink driving). I dont act aggressively/embarrassingly which is almost worse. I feel like those around me think it's kinda OK cause there's no repuecussions.

I want a life without waiting for my next drink. I want to wake up and not have alcohol dictate my life. Any advice on changes I can make to ensure I don't fall into the same trap as my siblings and mom?

Feel free to ask questions about other aspects of my life.

I quit drinking in May after a series of events that just fell short of ruining my life. Sobriety was pretty easy, especially because I decided to become a homebody and change my lifestyle. On top of that, I was terrified of drinking again. What if, in that vulnerable state, I nearly ruined my life (again)?

Cue last weekend. It had been 100 days that I was sober. I thought that I could have a few drinks and see how I felt - I didn't want to be terrified of alcohol, after all, just someone who didn't drink.

One bottle of wine turned into two, which turned into cocktails and tequila. I blacked out before 6pm.

Luckily, my partner brought me home, but what happened when I woke up is a huge reminder why sobriety is the only option for me.

Around 5am, I woke up with the worst headache of my life. I thought my head was gonna explode. I tried to sleep it off, but my heart was racing; anxiety, skyrocketing. I then became uncontrollably nauseous and spent the next half an hour throwing up. It was the worst hangover I've ever had.

I still felt rough three days later.

Although I regret ""caving"" so much, I'm glad it happened when it did, as my birthday approaches, I know I'll be enjoying it 100% sober. Maybe alcohol is for some people, but it will never be for me.

Socialising worries me.. I do drink alone, but I also drink with others. I drink to fit in... I always drank to fit in... And I never liked it. I wanted to do other things, but I was too attached to my party girl image. 

Now, the party girl is tired. Her dress is torn, her makeup is running, her lip is split and one of her heels has broken.

Party girl wants to be someone else.. party girl wants to be plant girl, beach girl, beautiful girl, peaceful girl, cat mum.

But alcohol, simultaneously her greatest friend and worst enemy, won't let her go.

I haven't been posting much here because I've been doing really well and not really thinking about drinking all that much. I've been very happy in my sobriety. I wanted to let you all know that I'm thinking about you.

I wanted to share my biggest takeaways from the first 90 days sober

First of all, I never thought I could do this. I never been sober for longer than maybe 2 weeks at most. I can't believe I've made it to 90 days and I can't believe it that I don't think about drinking constantly anymore. Being sober has made me realize how obsessed I was without alcohol. Now I have days where maybe I think about it once or twice in passing.

Second, I learned some really tough lessons in the first three months. I ended friendships with two people, which was really hard. They were both basically my drinking buddies and stayed friends with my ex. I realized that them bringing out my ex wasn't allowing me to move on from the relationship.

However, the more time I spent away from these friends, the more I realized that alcohol was what brought us together most of the time. I started spending time with other friends, and realized that friendships don't have to involve a ton of drinking. To be honest, I don't have a single sober friend but I do have friends that either drink very infrequently or have only one drink. I didn't realize how much I normalized alcohol, and going out and having three or four drinks. That is not normal!

Third, I miss the pink cloud! Early sobriety was such a joy and I found that it's kind of worn off a little bit. Like in the first two months, I had so much energy and was exercising all the time and now I'm often tired and just doing chores. I feel slightly less excited, but my city is also going through a covid wave so I've been mostly just staying inside and anyway. I'm using this time to pack up my apartment and move soon!

Lastly, some of you mentioned that you don't use social media. After sometime thinking about it, I decided to delete my Instagram. I found it created a sense of calm within me though I definitely spend more time on Reddit! I found that on social once I got sober, I noticed that I was living my life to be seen somehow. Now I find that I can get quiet, think about what I really want and know the answer really quick. I'm thinking about making a big life change of moving next year. I don't feel the need to talk it out with a bunch of internet friends. I don't feel the need to tell anyone what I want to do, it's great having the freedom to just think

Okay, well I wasn't expecting this to be so long. I hope everyone is doing well and I promise to keep checking in.",40,1

I‚Äôm stuck in what many people know is a vicious cycle - drinking due to anxiety while aware that alcohol is fueling the anxiety to a great extent.

1632,2021-08-20 02:48:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p7wumo/only_drink_around_people/,Only drink around people.,"Dear Reddit. This is my 5th day without alcohol. I have been struggling with it for about 4 years now. Been drinking almost daily and lately, heavily. I understood one thing : I  only need to drink when I am around people. For example, each day I will call someone or meet someone who I consider to be my friend , but I am willing to have contact with them only when I have alcohol ( including phone calls with them and I feel bad about it). I feel that without alcohol my friends are not really my friends but only people I like to talk to when I am tipsy. 

Also, I noticed that I only smoke when drinking so quitting the booze will automatically make me quit smoking, as well.

With this being said, I am starting to also see my life in another perspective and ask myself various questions : am i really inloved with my boyfriend or is it just the booze? Do I really like the people around me or is it just the alcohol? Do I hate mornings or is it just the hangovers?

What mindset do I need to approach in order to rediscover myself, let go of the poison completely and rethink my life? I feel like the 'friends thing"" is affecting me the most, because I really have a good time while on alcohol with them, but without it, I just want to spend time alone and I don't think this is healthy long-term. Without alcohol I realize that I am not what I think I am and this thought is messing with me.",3,0

My old ways included frequently blacking out, getting myself into trouble, and feeling like absolute garbo the next day. And repeating this four days a week. 

I‚Äôm extremely unproductive when I‚Äôm drinking (and after drinking) and I want to make school a priority this year. My binge drinking from last year made it extremely difficult for me to keep up with my studies. 

I don‚Äôt want to commit to not drinking when I go back to school because I‚Äôm afraid of the self-loathing I would feel if I started drinking again. Additionally, I don‚Äôt want to tell anyone because I‚Äôm afraid of the judgement I would receive if I started drinking again. But I also don‚Äôt want to drink because of all of the negative impacts it has on my life. Cognitive dissonance is just so tiring. 

I feel like moderation isn‚Äôt really an option. When I drink, I DRINK so I think steering clear of the liquid poison is my best option. Does anyone have recommendations of how to enjoy myself at football games, tailgates, parties, etc. without drinking? I am involved in Greek life and I love the friends I have made, and I don‚Äôt want to lose them because I‚Äôm unable to enjoy myself around them when they‚Äôre intoxicated at the events we attend. 

If I find myself too bored or introverted at parties, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to start drinking. Also, nothing wrong with being introverted, I definitely am, but I am much more extroverted when I‚Äôm drinking and parties usually cater to the extroverted.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Watching the Check In unfold is a humbling experience. I wrote about it in the anniversary post, and to quote, well, myself;

> As the sun rises in the East the first early check-ins appear, along with a few late night wrap ups. Then as the sun slowly rolls across the globe hundreds of voices chime in, with reports of last night¬¥s sleep, and of getting kids to school, and walking dogs, sharing hopes and fears and struggles and victories. It¬¥s life itself unfolding, with hundreds of people setting out to meet it sober. It¬¥s humbling and awe-inspiring.

It truly is. So is the honesty and openness that you guys bring to the table. Internet strangers acting like - *being!* - family! Chatting away over the breakfast table, or dinner table, or grabbing a snack on the way from here to there. Pretty neat. In this chatter across the table, I keep returning to the fears and struggles part - somewhat ironic, since the Check In is full of hopes and victories. I need to remind myself that today is a day for hope.

Today is sunny and warm. I hope to take in as much as possible of that warmth. So, fam, what is your hope for today?

I will not drink with you today!

Do you want to host the check in for a week? Holler! Or whisper. You¬¥ll get all the info you need, and there are no expectations as to how eloquent it has to be. *‚ÄúWhy waste time say lot word when few word do trick‚Äù -Kevin Malone*

Recently I made the decision to stop drinking all together. Just in the last couple of days I have told a couple of friends that I am not drinking (I sort of left out ""ever again"") and the first thing they asked was ""until when?"" and ""well when you're back on the booze we have to go out.""

I met a new mom from my kids' school and she says ""id love to have you over for cocktails!""

The foundation that I am on is having a back to school cocktail party. 

The baptism of my best friend's baby was a beautiful lunch with endless bottles of wine. 

These are by no means out of control, wild events. Just normal events, normal get togethers. And yes of course there are non-alcoholic drinks available. 

My point is that alcohol just goes with the territory, always. And we celebrate it because it's social and wine is delicious and and craft brews and fancy cocktails. 

Alcohol is addictive and it's my personal belief that there are no ""normal drinkers"" and ""non-normal drinkers."" Just because alcohol is such a huge, tolerated and celebrated part of society doesn't change the fact that it is an addictive toxin. 

That's all.",6,0

So I know the big book says one needn't drink copious amounts to be an alcoholic (for example, women retain less water or something so they get a high BAC with less). But is AA really for me (30M)? With people talking about drinking an absolute fuckton in AA meetings, and people really struggling with that outside of AA (I'm pretty sure I saw a DTer in the store today)... what would you guys think in a meeting if I actually opened up about my own lightweight struggles, where my teeth are destroyed and I drink to get drunk every single day?

So first, I don't work tomorrow, so technically it's my ""Friday"". Starting the weekend, I would always have a drink to cheers a solid work week. This has been eating at me all day. I knew the night would come and my brain would start trying to convince me towards the booze. But I won't do it. I promised this community and I'm not going back on that. 

Anyways, to the more tempting events of the last 24 hours: my SO knows I'm going through this, and decided to go and have a few too many last night, sending me drunken texts, snapchats and whatnot. This really irritates me because I was fairly clear on not being associated with drinking (meaning I don't want to see it, hear about it, etc), though apparently this didn't resonate with SO from the drunk texts. Doesn't make it any easier. 

That being said, my SO had a pretty rough day today, and seems to be taking it out on me. I won't go into details, but it's definitely not helping me from staying away from the bottle. 

Anyone have advise for dealing with people who are hurting your progress towards sobriety? I don't want to hurt anyone, and I know they mean well, but I also know I have to look after myself first, and it's okay to be selfish here. Just not entirely clear on how to discuss this with people.

I've tried so many times over the past few years and haven't had much success, but somehow this sub truly helped. Reading about the successes and struggles of others here sparked something new. I realized I wasn't alone, there were so many posts that I felt like I could have written myself, word for word. Just knowing there are so many folks out there in the world battling this thing day to day, just like me, although it's really heartbreaking, it was also somehow motivating.

The first few weeks were tough, but after about a month something changed. I wasn't thinking about alcohol much at all any more. I didn't feel like I needed to read posts or do daily check-ins here. For the first time I can remember, I felt like I'd managed to beat it. I was able to keep this up for about 2 more months. But right around the 3 month mark I drank again. There was no reason in particular that I can recall. I just bought some alcohol while grocery shopping. I remember contemplating pouring it out when I got home. That was the moment of truth for me, and I drank it instead. That was 2 weeks ago. My first drink was follow by day after day of telling myself I'd stop again tomorrow. I'm feeling absolutely miserable after 2 weeks of continuous drinking and I've decided that I'm sticking to my promise today, resetting my counter and giving it another shot.

I think a major reasons I fell back into my old routine was because I replaced alcohol with really unhealthy eating habits. I'd justify eating a bunch of junk food in the evenings because at least it wasn't as bad as drinking. I feel like I've got to figure out how to stop drinking but also not replace the alcohol with something else.

I'm originally from a country where drinking every day at lunch is socially accepted, and actually not doing it excludes you. I don't have any friends from there who don't drink regularly and have some sort of alcohol disorder- getting wasted during the week, driving while drinking, etc.

A few months ago I had to take antibiotics, and this time, I didn't drink while taking them, basically because of an enormous throat infection and I realized how dependent I was on alcohol...it was a nightmare.

Finally, 3 months ago I took the decision of quitting, and to be honest, the first days/weeks were horrible, not only for dependence also for the peer pressure. But now, when I think of that Sunday morning when I took that decision, I think of that day as **one of the happiest days in my life.**  I don't regret it, I won't drink again.

""No man knows how bad he is till he has tried very hard to be good. A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of a wind by trying to walk against it, not by lying down. We all want progress, but if you're on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.""

I usually hype myself up a lot and have fun the entire birthday week, indulging myself and feeling important.  But I told myself a week ago, just make it to your birthday sober.  I did that.  Then my favorite music group came on livestream and saw my comment and said happy birthday to me... I had a fit of excitement (literally shaking and excited for an hour straight).  I messaged everyone who knows about my intense love for that group about that birthday shoutout.  Then I had pizza and lava cake with my family.  I video called my sister and told her about how I thought maybe I would smoke a few molecules of weed because it was my birthday, but I didn't even feel like doing that because I don't want to feel ANY anxiety.  She knows I'm counting my sober days, but when I had told her, she had asked me, ""Why, are you drinking that much that you actively have to cut back?"" And I had explained it away saying that I wanted to lose weight, and since I sucked at exercising or dieting, this would be an easy way to cut back on calories.

Then around 3 am, I suddenly had the very real urge, for the first time since quitting, to try and have just one drink.  I pushed that urge down with a slice of pizza, some sprite, and reading some smutty fanfiction.  I'm proud that I got through the urge, but for a little while there, I was really forgetting why I was even strictly restricting myself, why didn't I go through the experiment of drinking JUST ONE DRINK, because it's my birthday and to prove I could just have one.  I literally started sweating as I contemplated doing that, and started panic googling articles about this particular train of thought regarding just one drink, and went on the chat for this subreddit.

The reason I came up with was:  because I didn't want to reset my badge on here.  I never back down from a challenge, but I had never seriously challenged myself before to QUIT DRINKING ENTIRELY.  Now I'm competing against my sloppy drunk dumbass demon self, and I JUST starting getting an edge against that embarassing bitch.  

I had previously just thought I wanted to break out of my current dependence, go through withdrawal, spend some time sober, and then be a normal person who can just have a few drinks.  I also promised myself I wouldn't drink alone (which in my situation is the same as never drinking because I don't have many opportunities to drink with someone, living in a conservative country with my family). Meanwhile my dad drinks whiskey every day, going through too many bottles a week, to which I contributed GREATLY, thinking I was beibg sneaky sometimes, and other times not giving a fuck. So I'm sure even he has noticed recently that not even a sip disappears from his bottle, while before I would disappear half the bottle overnight because I stopped caring about him knowing I was partaking of the devil's piss.  We don't talk about it, because we never talk about anything.  Up until today I would look at his whiskey bottle every night while I cleaned the kitchen, and say to it, ""FUCK YOU, HA HA!""  Just 25 days ago, that nighttime cleaning routine would be my time to get absolutely plastered from that same bottle.  

I'm SUPER glad I don't have panic attacks anymore (maybe some anxious episodes, but no debilitating entire days gone down the drain).  I'm getting #tasks done every day, and my mom is super relieved that no alcohol is going missing; I even turned down a beer the other day when my mom decided to have one for the first time in MONTHS.  She looked impressed, and I gave her the same excuse about wanting to lose weight.

Another reason is because Namjoon and Jin from BTS said happy birthday to me and they also talk every day about loving myself goddammit, and I'm gonna do that.

I remember my mom brining me a cake on my 18th birthday & all I could do was cry. I know birthdays are a gift in and of themselves. & I know I'm fortunate to see 38 as there are countless others who never made it this far. Even still, I'm tearing up thinking about having to get through the day tomorrow. All I want to do is call off work & lay in bed until it's August 21st. But I won't because too many people count on me... when I call off it directly affects multiple families. Previously I would celebrate/ get over my birthday blues by drinking until I could be sure I wouldn't remember anything the following day. I have people who would happily celebrate my birthday with me sans alcohol that's not the issue,  the issue is I don't want to celebrate sans alcohol ( but I also don't want to drink).

Also...I feel like the 1st half of my sobriety has been fairly easy and now the real test of strength begins with my birthday... then there'll be Halloween (my fav), a vacation in Mexico, Thanksgiving,  NYE... a whole lot of sober 1st & I can't say I'm excited for any of it & that makes me sad. 

Anyway... thanks for reading & iwndwyt

Edit to update:

So I survived... but more than that I actually enjoyed it. We ordered my favorite pizza & watched The Jungle Cruise with all 3 of my kiddos and my heart was so content. And since I didn't drink I was able to wake up early & go to a hot yoga class. Hot Yoga has really been one of the best tools in getting/ staying sober as it elevates my mood & makes me feel strong. I'm going to try not to let myself fret too much about future sober firsts & just tackle them with my head clear & held high when the time comes. &&& I look forward to spending many more future birthday nights with my babies cuddled up by my side.",5,0
1686,2021-08-19 19:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p7pv7o/one_year_sober/,One year sober!,"I started this journey about 3 years ago without even realising it. I would take 2-3 month breaks from drinking in order to get my tolerance back down then go on a bender and it would all unravel for a few weeks, then I'd be back to my breaks. I could do the breaks relatively easily because I thought I was capable of moderation and knew I could go back to the alcohol afterwards. The real progress didn't start until around 14 months ago when it occurred to me that even under perfect conditions with my best friends, my favourite drinks and my favourite bars, I would still wake up anxious, suicidal and ill the next day. I couldn't take the hangovers anymore, hangovers that seemed to go on for days.

So I just stopped. First it was going to be a month, then a month turned into two, and then I just felt like it would be silly at that point to ruin my streak. I downloaded a sober counter onto my phone which helped massively and gave me the strength to stay sober.

Don't get me wrong, I had troubling moments. House parties, pubs, clubbing etc. But the doubts I had would wash away just a few hours later when I realised how drunk everyone else was and how depressing it looked. My decisions were validated by the fact I could wake up the next day with all of my money and know exactly what I did the night before.

Throughout this year, I have shared parts of my journey with others around me and have been amazed at how many people have told me they want to cut down. It's so easy to see people drinking, having a good time and assume that they're the lucky ones. It turns out a lot of my friends want to stop, they just don't know how.

A defining moment was when I was in a night club, dancing and drinking lemonade. My friend told me that night that she saw how much fun I was having sober and decided to have just one drink at the bar, not the 4 shots she thought she needed to be confident. She called me an inspiration that night and I beamed with pride. I won't push any of my friends to take my path, but if they want to know more, I am so happy to help them.

Stopping drinking wasn't the answer, not wanting to drink was the true answer. The smell of alcohol alone makes me want to puke now. I genuinely think that this time, is the time I will be sober for good. I have retrained my brain, mostly through the fantastic community here and 'This Naked Mind' and now I feel like I've been set free.

I don't post much here but I visit every week and continue to listen and reflect on the stories shared here. Thank you all for helping me through this.

I need y'all's help. Is there some sort of tea or drink or snack that can help me calm down? Maybe a chill game to play or some activity to do? I'm also still worried about not being able to sleep. Please, any advice helps. I want this to be my last first day.

Been thinking today about how this shouldn‚Äôt be called stop drinking because (sure you have to stop) but the path to stopping is what you start. 

I also used to think big problems needed big solutions (the real meaning of David vs Goliath) but it‚Äôs actually the small things i did that helped me stop. 

So often people ask how to stop‚Ä¶.

I stopped by starting:

* stress reduction - baths, swims, walks, music, journaling, positive mantras, loving kindness. Headspace meditation. Guided body scans on YouTube with Jon kabat zinn or Michael sealey

* distraction (all that free time) - books, tv shows, podcasts, audiobooks (good for insomnia if you‚Äôve read it before so it doesn‚Äôt keep you awake)

* fun - comedies, call friends. Lighten up! Have fun. 

*reading - Annie grace. I liked the audiobook. Or else I read Comforting crap. 

* SD - coming here. Responding to the new posts so everyone gets a response. My way of paying it forward

*support - I had to pay a therapist to listen to me waffle on once a week and tell me how clever I am because no one in my life does that for me. 

* alternatives - fizzy drinks in fancy glasses, (controversial) non alcoholic drinks (life saver for me. Stopped them after about 6 months. Now I take one if we visit friends and everyone else is drinking)

* avoidance - especially the first few months not forever - watching tv if that‚Äôs your trigger, going to bars (meet for a walk or coffee), dinners out (do lunch)

* put yourself first - again not forever but for a few months try putting your sobriety before everyone and everything

*hope - when Pandora opened the box and unleashed all the horrors there was also hope in that box. This story has lasted because hope is so important to us humans. 

These are the things I tried. While I was just trying to stop, I couldn‚Äôt. I had to start stuff. I was surprised how effective small things are.

I‚Äôve (33f) been dating this wonderful person (35m). We‚Äôve been dating for 3+ months and
I really adore him. 

For the first time I can see a potential future with someone‚Ä¶ getting married, having kids, growing old and living a overall happy life. I‚Äôve never felt that before so it‚Äôs been really nice to finally know what that feels like and be in that place with someone.

He‚Äôs successful, intelligent, funny, has a huge social group, and isn‚Äôt anything I would have ever associated with being an alcoholic. 

He recently admitted to me that he has a problem with alcohol. He himself said he was an alcoholic. Not that he drinks all the time but sometimes when he starts he can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôve seen him do this a hand full of time. One night in particular has stuck with me and the memory keeps bubbling up. He drank a TON‚Ä¶ to a point that he eventually got a glazed over expression and it‚Äôs like he wasn‚Äôt even there anymore. 

I called his name and this zombie of a person slowly looked at me and I just had this urge to get out of his space. I was supposed to spend the night but I don‚Äôt know how to describe it‚Ä¶ I felt incredibly uncomfortable, the look felt hostile, and just knew I had to leave. 

I honestly didn‚Äôt think too much of it‚Ä¶ I just chalked it up to him getting too drunk. I‚Äôve never known an alcoholic and I have no idea what to look out for. My very close friend is married to an alcoholic tho and her life has (very long story short) been hell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen what what he‚Äôs put her through and when I first met him he wasn‚Äôt that way. I‚Äôm starting to realize he started out the way my SO is now. Sometimes just goes too hard and drinks way too much.

My question is‚Ä¶ is it possible for someone to realize their an alcoholic super early and put a stop to it before it develops into a huge problem? If he does catch it early‚Ä¶ can he still have a relationship with alcoholic and just learn to not lose control? Or does it have to be all or nothing? Like he has to quit drinking completely?

I‚Äôve been trying to research but haven‚Äôt found anything on this at all. Any guidance would be  very much appreciated.

*UPDATE*

Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond and share your advice and stories. It‚Äôs been incredibly helpful to get advice from both this group and the friends and family support group. I now have a much better understanding of what I‚Äôm up against and can make an education decision on what‚Äôs best for me moving forward. 

I also uncovered a lot more dark things from him leaving his phone here. His best friend is also an alcoholic (this I knew) and they have an incredibly unhealthy enabling relationship (this I didn‚Äôt know). My SO alcoholism is a much bigger problem then he‚Äôs alluded to and they actively talk about that as well as when they are going to go get drunk together.

His best friend also has no morals and is actively bragging about cheating on his girlfriend‚Ä¶ while they were at a Bachelor weekend earlier this month they got black out drunk, left the house they were at, and spent hours finding hookers. So he cheated on me‚Ä¶ during the honeymoon phase of our relationship with a hooker and never told me about it.

For the past year and a half, I have started to separate myself from drinking culture. Thanks to this sub, I am now officially 1 week sober!","I am probably much younger than most of you - to be completely honest, I am not even of legal drinking age yet. That being said, alcohol has been available in my life since I was 15 years old. I grew up attending high school parties where kids would consume high volumes of cheap alcohol and it was a staple of living on Fridays and Saturdays. I was very much apart of that crowd and when I graduated I moved on to attend a big name university where the party culture was on a completely new level.

As a young, 18 year old. I spent every single Friday attending class until 2pm and then immediately starting to drink vodka with my friends at the time. Honestly, I preferred smoking weed to drinking but I still continued to drink because it felt like that was the only way I could fit in at the time. After a night of blacking out, I would wake up around 1-2pm on Saturday only to eat and start the process all over again. Honestly, if I did not have a camera in my pocket at all times, I would have 0 memories of my social experiences that year because it all revolved around drinking.

A couple of months later, my friends decide that we should all join a fraternity together. I wanted to impress the older guys there, so I showed up hammered to most of the initial events until I was extended an invitation to join them. Looking back, this was a massive mistake because I was creating friends who liked how I acted when I was under the influence and not friends who liked me for me.

When lockdown started in March 2020, I was taken out of the college environment and the urge to drink depleted almost entirely. From an outside view, it looked like a complete 180 because I went from partying and drinking 3 nights a week to not even having a sip with dinner. But internally, I was thankful that I could start doing what I enjoy without feeling the need to drink to fit in.

A couple months later, I stumbled upon this subreddit. I binged through it for hours reading stories of people who lost loved ones, people with serious medical conditions, and people who were just desperate to get their life back. This hit me like a brick wall because there is no one my age who goes through struggles with alcohol like the people in this sub. It really opened my eyes to the path that me and most of my friends were going down, and I started making subtle changes to my life that would lead to me being happier and healthier.

It has taken some time, but I now feel comfortable in my sober lifestyle and I am officially 1 week sober! (I am sure that I have gone longer than this without drinking, but it was never intentional.) I get a decent amount of shit talking from my friends and hear just about every insult you can think about for my decision, but at the end of the day I am doing it for me and not them. As a matter of fact, I had a friend tell me a couple days ago that ""my life looked sad so I should grab a beer"". That phrase alone has stuck with me the past few days and kind of inspired me to write this post.

So yeah. I turn 21 in a couple of weeks and I assure you I will not have the classic 'black-out-for-your-21st' birthday. Instead, I will be hiking with my girlfriend and feeling great that I do not let alcohol control my life.

Obviously I will always have guilt for the wrong things I did while drunk, but I can simply look back at them now as lessons.

I was wondering if anyone wanted to share some dark moments from their drinking days to make us all feel less alone. 

I've been thinking about one in particular. It's not necessarily dark but rather alarming and quite sad that I didn't notice how not normal it was at the time.

I had purchased a bottle of wine - just one, because I was trying to ""cut back"" - and I figured if I drank it all within a couple minutes, I would feel drunk enough. It was already late and the liquor stores were closed, so my plan had to work or else I'd have wasted a ""fun"" night of drinking.

Well, I chugged it and felt absolutely nothing. I started to panic, searching in the fridge and cabinets for anything to drink, but I had no alcohol in the house. 

But there was one thing, pushed far back in the fridge.... A bottle of cooking wine.

I was so desperate to feel a buzz that I literally drank salty, old cooking wine. 

I didn't get drunk. I just felt really shitty. And I didn't even quit drinking until long after that night.

I went to my first AA meeting via Zoom earlier this week. I've been sober for 11 months but am socially isolated and wanted to make some sober connections. One person in the meeting was talking about how magical and wonderful alcohol was the first time they drank, and describing it in these really detailed terms that sounded like a seductive advertisement. It was really jarring. When I stopped, I followed Annie Grace's This Naked Mind and Alan Carr and changed my thinking about what alcohol was. I read extensively about what alcohol actually does to the body, and came to the conclusion that it's disgusting. I have felt emotionally labile and depressed at points over these past 11 months, but I have not been tempted to drink. Thinking about drinking can sometimes make me gag. 

This AA meeting seemed to have a different approach. Alcohol is this mystical, dangerous elixir that told you it would solve all your problems but took you to hell. I just don't see it that way. I never had that relationship with it. I'm a polysubstance abuser, and if anything, I had that sort of romantic idealization of harder drugs. Alcohol was a secondary addiction; it was a substitute or an accelerant. 

I really liked the people in the meeting and I personally really love the spiritual component. But after the meeting I went out to dinner and there were people at different tables drinking beer. For the first time in almost a year, the beers looked seductive. I had my first relapse dream this morning. It was so terrifyingly real. 

I was just really confused by it. People at the AA meeting said that people who don't go to AA meetings always relapse. And now I have this little seed of doubt planted in my head. 

Anyone else have a similar reaction to AA meetings?",68,0

While I‚Äôm down on myself for drinking last night I realized this morning that I‚Äôve been sober more days this week than I‚Äôve been drunk! This hasn‚Äôt happened in a long time. I even strung three days together. Now it‚Äôs partly because of a huge drunken fuck up earlier in the week but, I‚Äôm still counting it. I need to not discount the small successes because discounting it just leads to shifty self talk which leads to negative emotions which leads to drinking. 

On the other hand though, the last few drinking nights have gone from I got it, to let‚Äôs drink more, to let‚Äôs go out and then go home and drink more and then add weed and then contemplate adding more meds on top of that. This slide happened fast. It‚Äôs worrisome and yet more proof that moderation is a myth for me. I‚Äôm usually such an all or nothing person and yet with this I keep trying to find the gray. That‚Äôs a bit ironic. 

My work life has been stressful and that stress just got kicked up to eleven. I‚Äôm trying to move in the midst of all of this. Most of my friends are on a rad vacation and I‚Äôm at home. My moving help basically is non existent. This time of year is very triggering for me and it seems like there are just more and more triggers piling on. It‚Äôs overwhelming, to say the least. Being sober means lots of emotions flying around and it‚Äôs daunting. But I can do this. I just need to commit to it. Which has been challenging. 

With those few sober days I felt so much less bloated. I felt spry! Haha. I dropped pounds. I ate better. I didn‚Äôt sleep the greatest, I stayed up watching TV, but the sleep I got was better. I‚Äôve known this month was going to be hard and it‚Äôs just getting harder. I‚Äôd wanted to be sober for all of it but I‚Äôve failed at that. BUT I don‚Äôt have to let that bring me down or have that be the story for the rest of this month. I have an opportunity to step up and step in and make a change. I‚Äôm scared, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready but here we are.

Just wanted to post a reflection. Coming up on 3 years and my life has shifted dramatically since.

3 years ago I was broke, depressed on the verge of suicide, and about to lose my job. I was an office manager with no idea what I wanted to do with my life anymore. Since stopping I've found I have a huge heart for homeless people and have committed the last year or so working with them to help them on housing and working full time in a shelter. I'm working on an LADC and hopefully starting a masters in social work next year. I think I've found the woman I want to marry. I'm estatic but NONE of this would be possible if I never quit.

Some things I found important:

Stopping doesn't make everything better, but you have to stop to get better

You need to work on yourself, AA is great if it works for you (it wasn't my thing) but you need to find SOMETHING as a practice to maintain sobriety 

You'll have really bad days, that's life you need to keep fighting

Early sobriety is going to fuck with you especially when reflecting on your drinking. This was the hardest for me, forgive yourself and move on. You can build a better you.

My chronic insomnia has, if anything, worsened. I haven't lost any weight even though I'm exercising more, I'm exhausted every evening and, without the happy hour cocktail switch to flip, the life stress is accumulating despite my efforts to mitigate it through outdoor exercise, yoga, meditation, etc. Last night the urge to drink hit hard ‚Äì¬†getting through the evening was a real white-knuckler ‚Äì and when I turned to my usual places of reinforcement, reading all the ""Everything is better now!"" posts and books made me cranky and envious, two emotions that had the opposite effect of what I was looking for. 

I realize this might make me sound like a real jerk ‚Äì I know I need to shift my perspective and that the voice telling me sobriety isn't making enough of a difference to continue is one I should not listen to, that at the very least, fewer negative experiences is a good enough reason to keep going.

I‚Äôm trying to give up alcohol as I‚Äôve had enough of the side-effects: brain fog, tiredness, degradation in physical appearance, negative mood, etc.

I‚Äôm also ‚Äòof a certain age‚Äô with 2 small kids and I want to grow old with a clear mind and as many personal ambitions fulfilled as I can.

Part of my problem is I think ahead to social situations, where even imagining not drinking is extremely difficult, and I lose the resolve to give up.

On Saturday, for instance, I‚Äôm going to visit a friend whose house I haven‚Äôt been round to since the pandemic hit. He‚Äôs a big wine guy and he‚Äôs been saying ‚Äòwe‚Äôll have some great wine when you come over‚Äô for quite a while now. So, in my limited way of thinking I give up and accept that I will have to drink.

Then I think about visiting my brother who is living abroad. He‚Äôs a big drinker. I feel like I‚Äôd spoil the trip if I didn‚Äôt drink; that if I didn‚Äôt drink I would, somehow, let him down.

Having people over is another situation where it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine not drinking.

Social drinking isn‚Äôt the only drinking I do. I drink alone too, so the powerlessness I feel related to social drinking isn‚Äôt my only obstacle ‚Äì but it is stopping me from having the self-belief to move forward.

Can anyone relate?

When I was younger, this was very very common in my social group so I just assumed it would be something I'd ""grow out of"". 

Now I'm in my mid thirties. It happens much less often now, but largely because I go out less. I've never thought it was a problem because I have no problem NOT drinking and will often go weeks at a time without drinking, I can have one and stop if I'm driving etc, and I didnt drink (and didnt mind at all) while I was pregnant. 

I've lost counts of the times over the years I've woken up ashamed, embarassed, missing my phone/purse/keys or whatever, but I've always justified it to myself that ""everyone does it"" and found stories online of how people have fucked up much worse than me, to make myself feel better. 

Last weekend I fucked up. 

I have a 9 month old baby. My husband and I went to a party near my parents house so we decided we'd stay with them, my husband would leave the party to put the baby to bed, and then my parents would babysit until we got home. 

I woke around 6.30am as usual, fed the baby and put him back in his cot. I was very hungover and once again didn't remember going to bed, but as I said - not unusual for me, so I didnt think too much of it. 

My Mum was icy with me when I got up, but we were in a rush to get home so I just assumed she'd seen me come home drunk, and she really really doesnt like drunk people (understandable). 

When we were alone, my husband told me that infact, what had happened is that I'd got blackout drunk at the party and passed out, a couple of people helped me back to the house. The baby woke up a couple of hours later, and somehow my Mum-radar still went off even in that state so I got up to see to him, picked him up and passed out on the spare bed with him in my lap. My husband and Mum heard the baby screaming, came in and took him off me and I went back to bed, still totally out of it. I have NO memory of this whatsoever. 

I feel like the worst person, the worst Mother in the world. I just cannot stop crying and I feel like I have completely failed him and I keep getting flashes of how badly it could have turned out. 

I don't want to be this person. I never thought I had a drinking problem, but now I realise that not knowing when to stop is a BIG problem

I know the booze is taking a toll on my health and my doctor told me to quit six months ago which I did for a while but eventually relapsed. I kind of have two parts to my post here for all of you.  I work in a kitchen at a restaurant with a bar that has liberally available booze and was wondering if anyone has specific experience quitting while working at a place where the liquor is seemingly part of the job. Also I am traveling home in a few weeks to see my family and friends for the first time in two years. When I moved drinking had been firmly established as an integral part of my relationships back home. Part of why I caved last week was because I knew I would probably drink when I got home so I didn‚Äôt have a good reason not too. Also airplanes and airports were always a chance to binge over the last five years. So yeah basically anyone have tips about a sober vacation?

""Man, this would be so much more fun with some drinks, it has almost been a year now... I have self-control!"" but I held off. I just don't trust myself. I have a hard time thinking that I will NEVER be able to touch an alcoholic beverage again. I talk about it with my girlfriend non-stop. A lot of La Croix and Red-bull along the way has helped. I may make another post on my actual sobriety date listing more details that may help others.

The positives: I feel No more hangovers. No more hangover-induced panic attacks and anxiety (I have a SEVERE panic disorder that has been hard to overcome even with medicine, alcohol was also my medicine). More clarity in my decisions. Feeling healthier and not like death from the constant drinking. My liver enzymes are normal, and my liver is doing WAY better. I LOVE computers, building them (PCmasterrace), and programming - and am diving more into that field now that alcohol is not interfering. I am not an arrogant ""Know it all"" (As much, haha) on topics and discussions.

The negatives I feel: I am 28 and do NOT feel like I have made it where I want to be, and do not like my current position in life (Gratitude can be hard). Sometimes I just lay down in the bed because I feel overwhelmed. I don't like that I cannot have a couple of drinks on the weekend/at a restaurant/with a friend/etc. - and call it that. All of my emotions and feelings sometimes go full force now. I feel like certain friends do not contact me/talk to me/etc. just because I do not drink anymore nor am I ""As fun"" as someone I went to school with put it when they invited me over, only to find out I don't drink anymore... Will I ever be able to drink alcohol like I want to?

If anyone needs (Or has) some support, tips, help - Let them fly. I will try my best! This turned into a bigger rambling than I wanted it to be, and isn't very well organized or grammatically correct as I would want it. My good old perfectionist coming out.",729,0

**Thankful Thursday is a weekly thread where we share and discuss our gratitude. Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

‚Äî‚Äî

Hey everyone! Recently I‚Äôve been thinking about how grateful I am to be open and able to implement changes. Before I stopped drinking, life was a much bleaker version of Groundhog Day and I experienced 8 years of arrested development. Alcohol was absolutely in the driving seat.

Quitting drinking had me return to being an active participant in my own life and it‚Äôs begotten so many changes, big and small. Some of the smaller things include switching up my style/hair or diet (I went veggie in January), other things have been bigger, such as moving cities and choosing to work actively on my mental health and personal development (I‚Äôm looking at YOU, shitty boundaries and codependent behaviours). I have even started to develop long-term career dreams that I‚Äôm not quite ready to try and implement just yet, but sobriety has given me a sense of hope about everything that has me feeling optimistic about life. That all kinds of changes ARE possible. The prospect of change used to fill me with dread, but now I have hope and feelings of excitement about the infinite possibility of it all. There is a little bit of fear that comes with change, but I think that‚Äôs normal and even a bit of a good sign; growth isn‚Äôt always comfortable.

I am grateful of the sense of empowerment in having reclaimed ownership of my life and its direction. I operated so much like a leaf on the breeze ‚Äì it was so passive, and I did not at all feel in control of my journey, nor did I care. These days I actively check in with myself to ask, ‚Äòwhat do I want?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat do I need to make x happen?‚Äô and I think about how to make those changes. It‚Äôs always baby steps ‚Äì I am in no way moving mountains ‚Äì but it‚Äôs progress in the right direction, nonetheless. I got a frigging treadmill last week, guys. This time four years ago (and 40lbs ago) I‚Äôd almost puke every time I bent over to lace up my boots. Never thought I‚Äôd be a treadmill person, but that‚Äôs change for ya. I continue to surprise myself.

I thought this excerpt from The Great Gatsby was a nice way to close:

*‚ÄúFor what it‚Äôs worth: it‚Äôs never too late or too early to be whoever you want to be. There‚Äôs no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you‚Äôre proud of. If you find that you‚Äôre not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.‚Äù*

Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share what you‚Äôre grateful for today - whether that‚Äôs your own reflections on changes or whatever you‚Äôre appreciating right now.

Have a good day! Alex",50,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It¬¥s Thursday, the day that slowly changed my thinking. How? Why, because of Thankful Thursday, of course! *Disclaimer: The following text contains soppy instant poetry that might make you choke on your breakfast bagel!*

Around the time I stopped drinking, I was turning into a bitter grape. I didn¬¥t see much light, or hope, or meaning, and kept going mostly because of my family. I read the Thankful Thursday post, and sitting there by my window with my coffee I thought, I have lost everything, I have *nothing* to be thankful for. *Nothing.*

Nothing, I thought, and took a sip of coffee. Nothing, as I held my cup, warming my aching fingers.

See what¬¥s happening here?

So I said, alright then, I¬¥m thankful for my cup of coffee.

Later I was thankful for my window. Then my wool socks. Then my fireplace.

These gratitudes were like the tiniest specks of gold shining in the night. By noticing them, one by one, I could see more, and following this trail I began to see a sky full of stars.

Noticing the little things in life changed how I looked at life itself. It shifted my focus from lying there, staring at my pile of misery, to get up and go looking for the little nice things. Sure, sometimes I still faceplant into misery, but when I do, I try to take a breath, roll over and look at the stars. It¬¥s so much better.

Oh and I even look forward to Winter, because I have coffee, wool socks and a fireplace.

What are your gratitudes for today? [Check out the Thankful Thursday post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p79wp1/thankful_thursday_chchchanges/) and share there, or here, or even better - on both!

I will not drink with you today!

When hes drunk he talks about wanting to hurt himself. And its so hard because my AA brain wants to stay and help a fellow alcoholic but when is enough enough u kno? And he geta very mean and verbally abusive when he is drunk. Wont hit me but acts like hes going to. So i walk on eggshells constantly.

I'm in a long-distance relationship. This past weekend I had been drinking after work, went to hang on VR with my significant other and some of her friends. Apparently I was drunker than I realized, was a huge ass, made her and her friend cry, the works. I didn't even realize I had upset and embarrassed her. Hell, I thought I'd been poking at her a little and we'd all mostly had a good time and been joking around. but apparently I was just an absolute massive douche. 

We kinda talked the next day, and, well. I may have lost the love of my life and my best friend, for good. It's happened before, though not often, where I've come off as callous or an ass when I'd been drinking a bit, but I always put the sauce down and left it alone until I'd thought I was able to handle it again in moderation.

Overworked, stressed, and an unhappy home life (with my roommates, not my other half) had me slipping back into bad habits I was too blind to realize how deep I had gotten again. I was absolute shite, and I realize this, and I'm ashamed of it. She's tired of being heartbroken and worrying about me, her confidence in my.love for her has been shaken, and she's afraid I won't change.

Now I'm utterly terrified that I've fucked up beyond repair this time. I want to prove I can do better, that I will be better. I don't know if it's going to be enough, but I've got to do it. 

It has been a challenge not to fall back in. I've not had a drink since Sunday night, when everything happened. Lord knows I want one, if nothing else but to help me sleep. I'm not going to though. 

I apologize for the rambling, even if it may be a bit cathartic. 

Tldr; my drinking habits and a random mean streak from being too drunk may have ended the best thing I've ever had going for me. Not the wakeup call I wanted, but a definite slap in the face to stop. I will be better.",7,0

My intrusive thoughts that want me to drink are always saying that she wont know that I too some shots of the bottles and she won't notice a six pack missing, also she goes to sleep at 9 so I have all night to drink.
This was the case before, but before I let my alcoholism take control, now im trying to get it under control. Also I need to leave before the weekend, because the urge to drink gets heavier on saturday and sunday and i dont think im strong enough to also be on the beach those days.

Alcohol was my way of numbing it and skipping over laying in bed not sleeping because I'm thinking about my personal problems; the only time when I'm completely alone with my thoughts.

I've been drinking more and more, until now most mornings I wake up not even remembering how I got to bed, or just waking up in a chair.

I've gained over 120lbs, and started having serious medical issues because of the drinking.

I've still got a lot to deal with and work through, but I don't want alcohol to be my crutch anymore, as at this point it's literally leading me to an early grave. I'm 28.

I got on the wagon for a few months a long time ago, but fell back off when shit got heavy again.

Today is going to be the first day in at least 4 years that I'm going to not drink, and will go to bed sober. I want to break this cycle.

I don't want anyone to feel like I'm looking for attention or telling a sob-story. I just want to put it out there that I'm making a commitment to stop, since none of the few people in my life know about my problem, as I've been too ashamed to admit I have it.

Today I stop relying on alcohol to make myself sleep/forget my problems.

I knew I was going to have high blood pressure, and sure enough I was 138 over 104, so yeah...stage 2 hypertension. At 34...5' 11"" and 195lbs. The doctor mentioned that all my previous times taking my blood pressure would have been just like this one, amidst withdrawals and so we really don't know if I truly have high blood pressure or if it just related to the alcohol withdrawal. Never thought about that before. 

We discussed my anxiety, my true amount of drinking that goes on each week (about 5-10 drinks a night probably 5-6 nights a week), and what I wanted out of life moving forward. She was awesome! I got prescribed a couple of things for anxiety, a drug to help with inflammation in my esophagus (caused by the excessive drinking, and the pain in my sternum is often the beginning source of my anxiety attacks), and then told me that if I wanted to know my true blood pressure, come back in two weeks with now drinking in between. I thought to myself, ""Yes! A tangible goal!"".

I'm from Germany, known for their beer culture. I have been an alcoholic for most of my life (around 18 to 30) and have been sober for 216 days. I went almost every year to detox at a psychiatric ward and did a 3 months rehab in March this year.

I tried to quit many many times and never succeeded, drank around 5-6 liters (1.1-1.3 gallons) of beer a day, every day. I was absolutely miserable, lied to others and myself, fucked up about anything in my 20 just because of alcohol.

But in January this year it finally clicked and I dumped my beers in the sink at 11 am and went to friends to get a clear head. I don't know why my mentality changed so much but my desire to stay abstinent is the biggest strength I have in life.

  


Well, for the title: it has been actually easy since I stopped. Never thought ""maybe have just one drink"" or something like that. No desire to drink, and I know what you will think, this could be just a phase, but I am absolutely cold to the act of drinking. Have been going out with friends that drank, no problem at all. It's almost like I never had a problem.

I am very VERY cautious though because getting sloppy with those things can get you drunk real quick. I think I managed to get every positive thought about alcohol up and just despise it so much that it gives me strength. The random moments of euphoria are worth the stress of enduring tense emotional situations in sobriety. The way people talk to me, enjoy my presence, admire my dedication is also helpful

  


But most importantly I am fucking proud of myself for kicken this shit just for myself and enjoying every bit of it. It's nice to hear kind words but I do this because I think I am an absolute awesome person and (in a way because of suicidal attempts) a survivor ofy own build misery.

I guess therapy and rehab worked this time and my will was exactly on the spot.

But tonight, the in-laws were here to take the kids school shopping, so I was home alone when he came to get rid of the rest of them. After he did his thing, he came to the door and asked me to come out and let him show me what he did. I quickly went out to the deck and peaked at the space that he worked on, I gave my approval and was ready to send him on his way when I noticed the AA triangle logo tattooed on his arm. As we moved away from the bees, I asked him about it, and he said he was sober for 5 years after spending much of his 20s trying to get clean and sober (he's now 32). We had quite the conversation about our respective journeys to sobriety and he gave me his cell phone number in case I ever needed anyone to talk to.

Hey, the title pretty much says it all. I (36m) have been with my partner (46f) for almost 10 years. I have been told by friends, family, bosses, doctors, psychologist you name it that the relationship is toxic.

I feel like every time I take a step forward she pulls me back. She has been abusive both physically and emotionally. She has no accountability and everything is my fault.

I have lost friends and lost jobs because of her. There has been days without food, petrol and not being able to pay bills due to her actions. She regularly takes off to another state (Australia) to get a break for her ""happiness"" and leaves me with the mess she has created.

My family have all passed away, no real support network. I have abandonment issues and attachment issues which stems from my childhood.

Other attractive well grounded ladies that work like me and have tried to initiate things. I feel trapped and I can't let go.

I feel so stupid because I know this relationship is doomed but I hold on.

I should also add I have quit drinking which we both agreed to do. Mainly she was saying alcohol is bad. So I stopped for her, meanwhile she is getting wasted daily and calling me in the middle of the night hurling insults. She refuses to even give me a timeframe on when she plans on coming back. So far it's been 3 weeks, we have a house, dogs, she has work but can't tell me when she is coming back and when I ask she tells me ""when I'm fucking ready"" we are at risk of eviction with her not working.

Socialising and drinking, at least with my friends, are inextricably entwined. The 90's and early 2000's were a macho time when getting wasted and being jack the lad, a geezer, the life and soul, the boy etc., were considered desirable.  Thank god things have changed.  Social media has its ills, but it can  get people out of their goldfish bowl.  I for one used to live in a bubble in which going out with mates on the lash was absurdly important.

I will try harder, I need to get it out of my life.  It has taken so much and now when I need it most ( a broke, unemployed 42 year old with no partner or kids) it offers nothing in return.

1864,2021-08-18 16:44:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p6ztln/reflecting_on_6_months/,Reflecting on 6 months.,"There's been more than a few times I've wanted to give in and ""join the party"". I play in a band so I've had to learn how to enjoy parties and bars without the help of alcohol, I've learned just how much I would rely on it to be social. My thought process would literally be ""oh no, I have to talk to people. Better have a drink to make myself funny and relaxed."" 

Anyway, just this last weekend was a pretty full on gig. Big hostel party vibes, everyone was staying at the venue so it was a younger, more rowdy, drink til you pass out kinda crowd. It was the hardest I've had to try to stay ""relatively"" sober (I still consume weed edibles, but no alcohol or anything harder). 

Parties have always been my main trigger, ever since I moved out of home at 17. Impromptu gatherings where always on the cards and I needed to be drinking because I didn't want to be the only sober one. Instead I was usually the only drunk one, but that would never stop me.

Well anyway what kept me going straight was thinking about this community, thinking that I'm not the only one not drinking or going through this and thinking how much progress I've made even being able to go out and socialise or perform without the bottle holding my hand.

And... I ended up having a great time! I was a little anxious but didn't stay up stupidly late drinking everything I could find and was able to wake up feeling fine, enjoy the hike back to the car and drive us home while most of the band was hungover.

So thanks everyone for sharing your stories and experiences on this crazy journey, I would not have made it this far without your support and knowledge that I'm not alone. Stay strong folks! It's always worth it to not drink and I will see you in another 6 months! IWNDWYT!!",10,0

Hi guys, I am 127 sober today.  Alchohol had previously pushed me to the point where I lost myself. At first it was vodka.  Liquid fire that would burn so good going down and let me forget my stress, make conversations with people I didn't want to, and helped me sleep.  And then two shots a night quickly became a third of a handle a day.  I'm not even sure how much time lapsed between the progression from two shots to 15(?) shots. I would go to Costco and do my weekly shopping of four bottles of Kirkland vodka.  That ended me up in the hospital in June 2020, when I was hallucinating due to the high levels of amonia in my body.  The ""reality"" i was experiencing was so vivid and upsetting.  I would start screaming that someone was in my house, there were people in the bakyard... and I could SEE them.  Menacing faces watching me. Taunting me.  They were there and there was nothing i could do to stop them from breaking into my home or camping in my backyard.  I sobered up while in the hospital, tried to start treatment but ultimately I wasn't ready.  I had a couple of inconvenient interactions with the program staff and decided it wasn't going to work for me.

My genius idea was that what the real issue was that I just needed to switch to beer!  Vodka was just too much, too fast, but beer was like a slow burn that got me blacked out just like vodka, plus I wasn't ever hungry!  I stopped eating food.  I would wake up in the morning, puke in the shower, and then start drinking beer.  The monks drank beer as a meal, right?  I discovered Amazon Prime would deliver my imperial IPAs and now I didn't have to go anywhere!  The thought of food made me so sick.  I would frequently vomit when I started to feel that way, then follow with a beer to take advantage of the fact I wasn't nauseous for a minute.  I worked from home so i would drink all day then pass out before my husband and kids got home.  I didn't do anything with or for them.  Not on weeknights because I was done for the night already, or weekends (when I needed to ""nap"").  I didn't do back to school shopping, Christmas shopping, laundry, grocery shopping, cleaning...I just let it all go.  I missed back to school nights, baseball games, family events, dr appointments, school awards...My poor husband was left to be parents for both of us.

There is almost a year of pictures of my family that do not involve me.  Except for one from Christmas.  Where I stand in front of the tree with my husband and you can see my scalp through my hair.  So much of it had fallen out due to malnutrition.  My face is bloated and my eyes are yellow. I look ill.  Like my grandpa looked when he died of liver cancer when I was a kid.  I skipped Mother's Day, Father's Day, even my 5 years old's birthday party.  All because I was too busy slowly killing myself and abandoning my husband and children.

In April of 2021 I called my husband at work around 10.  ""I'm puking blood.  Bright red blood.""  My husband sighed and told me to call an ambulance.  That is how done he was.  I begged him to come take me to the hospital because I was so.embarassed and he conceded.  He picked me up, dropped me in the ER and left.  Told me that I needed to figure this out and I couldn't keep doing this to our family.  He set his boundary.  And I was so angry at the time, but I respect him for doing it. COVID patients took priority so I sat in that ER alone for 4 hours until they took me back.  Just spitting up small specs of blood.

When they took me back it was a blur.  I was so out of it and they also sedated me for all of the emergency procedures I needed.  Did an emergency endoscopy to close the tears in my esophagus which were causing the bleeding.  

After stopping the bleeding by putting rubber bands around the tears, they began to drain the enormous amount of liquid from my torso.  I had looked like I was 9 months pregnant and through tubes they inserted about 4 inches under each armpit,  they drained over 2 liters of fluid out of my abdomen.  This fluid collection was a sign of advanced liver disease.  My liver was dying.  I later learned the dr had to call my husband and ask if I had a Do Not Resuscitate order on file.  I was 38.

When I came around I spent the next 5 days in the ICU, and was then transferred to another unit.  After a week I was begging to go home. I had had enough.  I felt like shit and the drs could not give me anything to help due to how diseased my liver was.  

When I got home I didn't know what to tell my kids.  I ended up telling them I had pneumonia, but I made a commitment to stop drinking.  I got into treatment which was a godsend, met some really lovely people, including my counselor, and am here 127 days later in what feels like a new world.  

I don't miss alcohol.  I don't miss the shakes, the needing a drink to ""settle"" me in the morning and help me focus, the coming to and wondering what I did/said before I passed out, wondering how much my kids are noticing and how this will affect them in the future, the panic when my beers started to run low, the anxiety I would feel on recycle day when the emptying of our cans announced to the neighborhood,  with the erratic hair-pulling symphony of clinking glass, that I was an alcoholic.  I don't miss any of it. I think of how lonely, defeated and angry my husband must have been the whole time.  Hurting him that way is a shame I will always carry. I know I cannot have a single drop of alcohol because there is no ""just one"" for me.  I would quickly be right back where I started.  And for me it will never be worth it to risk having a drink if it means taking me and my family back to that place. 

Here is where I start to have trouble though (I know, total drunk/addict talk).  I do miss smoking weed.  I only ever did it occasionally at night when at home after the kids went to bed.  I hate being high around people besides my husband.  But when I smoke with him I just feel silly and then super ready to get him into bed.  I recently smoked.  Three times over the last two weeks, the most recent being last night.  Today I was asked to go get tested by my program, which I still participate in weekly.  I don't want to lie to my therapist, or take a test I know I will fail.  I'm OK with my choice, but I am super worried to let down my therapist and get ""kicked out"" of my program.  I also do not want to reset my sobriety date.  I'm proud of it, and although my Healthcare provider classifies my smoking as a relapse, I disagree.  Alchohol was going to (and still wants to) kill me and I will not allow that to happen.  I cannot burden my family that way ever again.

I wanted to get any feedback or opinions from you all out there.  Should I go get tested and then call my counselor?  Or should I just bow out of the program and thank them for all the help they have given me?  And in your experience has smoking marijuana been acceptable for you in your post-alcohol days?

I appreciate all of you and your collective knowledge and wisdom.  Take care of yourselves!",15,1

So, when I was younger i remember my dad drinking only on weekends or birthdays etc. But a few years ago it escalated. He started drinking on weekdays too and soon this was normal. His friends visit him and they also drink much. He comes home, [sometimes screams at my mom accusing her of cheating] eats, goes on the sofa and falls asleep almost immediately. Sometimes he doesn't eat because he goes straight to the tv and falls asleep. (I thought he was exhausted from work and felt sorry. But my older sibling harshly corrected this to me and explained it's from his drinking)

when someone (mom, sibling,I) meantions anything about his drinking he gets really mad. I almost never talk with him about, this since I'm scared and hate confrontations. and to get screamed at or even chased out of our apartment. I'm having a hard time reading his emotions sice i don't know if he means  stuff sarcastic or not. If i read it wrong he'll get very mad and sometimes throwing things around..

He doesn't get angry when anyone Else mentions it but later at home he'll be very mad and scream at us. 

He also gained lots of weight and isn't the youngest. His doctor's told him to loose weight but he doesn't listen.. I'm really worried about his health. 

Sometimes he also drives when drunk, not far maybe 5 minutes drives, but still does. I hate it because a friend of mine got killed by a drunk driver. Because of this i made a vow to myself to never drink and drive ( i barely drink because I'm scared to be like my dad)

Once i was brought into the hospital do to appendicitis. My parents where called and he couldn't help and get my car since he was drunk...

There has always been a time and place where I would indulge myself with a nice cold beer, the occasion would usually arise just after work or on my days off. Over the past 32 days I have managed to curb the neccessity ""we would believe that it is necessary to drink"". By taking breaks from train of thought or embracing the train of thought so much it would take my mind completely off the act of drinking. 

These breaks are a time to reflect on what could have been in the present and then being grateful for my current state. Acknowledging my past, know that I can't do anything about it but can make my brighter future today. I still have a long way to go but, it is as simple as one day at a time down to a second if need be of these little breaks that can help. Each second turns to minutes then to hours and so on..

I think just because you tackled the big demon (drinking) doesn‚Äôt mean the war is over.

I‚Äôm finding myself saying in my head ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to level this up again‚Äù 

Not to discredit any efforts or progress, but there‚Äôs also something to be said about complacency. It‚Äôs never good enough, there‚Äôs always more. Sure I‚Äôve lost weight, sure I feel more equip for what life throws at me, but there is still more work, more difficulty, more challenges to be sorted through. In the life category that is. Time to invest my saved money (from not drinking) into some equipment to take care of my body and be able to workout at home. Time to level up my professional life and work to become more financially capable. 25 years old and finding more and more ways to be introspective and get the results I want from life. Going inward really is a power if you can get through the traumas or shame or guilt of your past. I wish everyone on here the clarity to change there lives for the better and do the hard thing. 

I read a quote that was something along the lines of ‚Äúleaning into the discomfort of growth‚Äù and in applying that to life I can only say that it‚Äôs netted me positive results. Think it has something to do with not being ‚Äúone foot in one foot out‚Äù and just leaning in. I could go on and on but I think my point is made. Thank you for your time. Hope it was well spent.

Not only was I nervous because I didn‚Äôt know anyone but because of covid there wasn‚Äôt much socializing going on. So on my last night there, I was walking by and saw a bar that had a lot of people on the deck. I was drawn in by the laughter, the music and overall vibe. So I went in and had a few drinks. There, I finally spoke to a few locals, took lots of pictures, and even did karaoke. I did meet some great people there. 
The next morning was rough. The usual symptoms that comes with a night of drinking. Headache, brain fog, nausea. Luckily, I was able to get through it.

I saw this place mentioned on another sub and thought I'd have a little peek. It got my attention because I have been considering going teetotal myself. I'm not an alcoholic but I have a bit of a history with binge drinking. 

I took a break from alcohol at the start of the year and honestly I felt better for it somehow. I started drinking again on a social basis when the UK began to ease lockdown restrictions once more in the spring, but I tried to make sure I kept it in moderation. However there was one occasion quite recently I went out with a friend and got so drunk (not intentionally) that I woke up the next morning with no recollection of anything. Apparently I was in quite a state the night before. Now this was my first time getting drunk in quite a while, although that's largely owing to the lockdowns and restrictions we've been living under this last year and a half, however I have found in the past it can easily become a habit. 

I don't like getting to the point where I lose all control and leave myself vulnerable, not to mention causing myself to vomit, blackout etc. I used to enjoy getting drunk but now not so much. 

Going teetotal is becoming more appealing to me. I have found that I get carried away too easily so I'm thinking I am better off not drinking. It's not that I can't drink sensibly, but I have let my guard down all too often. 

Anyway, good to have somewhere I can talk about this with others who have either given up or are in the process of giving up. I would like to wish anyone who is in the recovery stage all the best with their journey.",25,2

Alcohol was a big part of my life (for more than 20 years!) and my best friend. How could I give it up!

But this time (I‚Äôd ‚Äúquit‚Äù a hundred times before), I was ready. I was tired of headaches and diarrhea, tired of my hubby and kids avoiding me, tired of seeing that bloated hag in the mirror. Tired of sneaking to buy vodka or wine, tired of hiding the empties until I could throw them out at a gas station, doubled bagged so nobody could tell. 

I won‚Äôt lie, the first few months were *very* hard. I had insomnia, I was depressed one minute then anxious the next. I was angry at everyone and everything. Because I quit alcohol damnit!  Why do I still feel bad!  A little research and I realized I had Post Addiction Withdrawal Syndrome. PAWS messed with me for months, but I‚Äôm a stubborn girl, and I gritted my teeth and kept going. I consoled myself with chocolate, and gained a few pounds. But I didn‚Äôt drink. 

About six months sober, I realized I was sleeping better, and not feeling depressed and anxious anymore. I rarely felt angry unless there was a reason. I could hardly believe it - I felt like a normal person!

It‚Äôs only gotten better since then. I‚Äôve been watching my carbs (I don‚Äôt crave sugar much anymore) and I‚Äôve lost some of the weight. That bloated hag is gone from the mirror and I see a middle aged woman with decent skin and clear eyes. And I see contentment - I hadn‚Äôt seen that in probably 25 years. I feel proud of winning the battle, and grateful for the support from this sub and my family. And I can‚Äôt forget God. He was with me the whole time, ready to help me when I got serious about quitting. Sometimes in the early days I felt tempted because I‚Äôd put down the bottle and still felt awful. But every single time, I‚Äôd hear from an old friend, or hubby would bring me flowers, or a dragonfly would follow  me during my daily walk. It was just a small boost to push me past the temptations. But I paid attention and gratefully battled on. 

There‚Äôs not much new to tell since I passed one year sober. But that in itself is a miracle. I‚Äôm normal!  Life is good, and I‚Äôm grateful. Every day when I wake up, I vow ‚ÄúI will not drink drink today!‚Äù And I won‚Äôt!

TLDR: I wanted to tell the newly sober folks to grit your teeth, stiffen your spine, and get past those hard first months. It is SOOOO worth it to be free, to be boringly, amazingly normal.

I have just under 6 months continuous sobriety, and had 5 months before that before a brief slip in February. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with and treated for depression and anxiety since I was a child, with many, many antidepressants, years of therapy, and most recently TMS. A couple questions for those of you that have gotten sober and have adhd:

- Did you find any difference in your feelings towards alcohol or desire to drink when taking medication?

- Did you decide on stimulant or non-stimulant meds, and how has that worked for you? 

(My doc is comfortable with me taking stimulants, particularly since I‚Äôm already on one of the non stimulant meds, Wellbutrin/bupropion, and still having symptoms. I‚Äôm trying to decide between discontinuing the bupropion in favor of trying a stimulant or first switching out the Cymbalta that I also take for strattera. My only worry with this is that both cymbalta and strattera are SNRIs, so am I going to see enough of a difference?)

- if you did opt for stimulants, how have you coped with the potential for addiction?

- did you have any issues with anxiety or sleep from your medication? How did you deal with it?

- for those of you with other diagnoses like mdd and gad, do you think you do have those as well or do you feel like you were misdiagnosed and your symptoms are from the adhd?

- if you‚Äôve had TMS, do you feel like it‚Äôs had any affect on your adhd or drinking? It‚Äôs made me feel a million times better depression wise. Understanding how it works by creating more neural pathways in your prefrontal cortex I feel like theoretically it could have some impact on those conditions as well.

- I‚Äôm now having these thoughts of am I really an alcoholic, or was I just self medicating my brain‚Äôs lack of dopamine? This worries me because there‚Äôs part of me that wants to try drinking again after my adhd is treated to see if it‚Äôs different, even though I know that‚Äôs a terrible idea. How have you dealt with thoughts like these?

- any other general suggestions for coping? I‚Äôm basically trying to just come up with ways to outsmart myself for when I inevitably forget things. For example- I forgot to put the lockbox out for my pet sitter after clearly thinking to myself that I needed to do that before I left. Thankfully, I already have a backup lockbox out back for situations like this so she could get in. Need more stuff like this to adhd proof my life.

There's a trade event in town and we have been juggling a sick baby and doing all the events, work stuff, selling, meetings the whole time.

The kid was sick yesterday so we didn't bring him to daycare. I got back at my usual daycare pickup time and tagged my BM out so she could work.

This is a quaint and positive arrangement because I don't have a place suitable for a kid, and we are kind of being adults about the whole thing. It's new.

I got sober a month and two days ago. And I feel like it's my super power. She is not there yet. And that's fine. Maybe she'll never get there.

The point of this story is not to throw BM under the bus, but to give an example of what alcohol takes from some of us. 

She was supposed to be home by midnight so she can wake up with the kid in the morning and get him ready for school. I would go home at midnight and get enough rest for hustling at the trade show all day.

It didn't work out like that... Because of alcohol.

As they say, one is too many, two is not enough. This was clearly the case as 1am rolls around and I start to get worried. At 3am I hear from her and she is blaming me for getting upset. I was upset.  I am upset.

The baby wakes up at 7, it's 3am.  A shocking rule pilots have is '8 hours from bottle to throttle'. I dont know about yall, but it often times took me more than a nights rest to sober up. To drive a car. Or to hold, feed, and take care of a baby.

So I'm angry, it's 4am...foir hours to baby showtime. I'm sleeping on a hard couch not meant to be slept on, in yesterday's clothes....

GRATEFUL.

Grateful for being reliable, trustworthy, present, and semi functional even on two hours of sleep. Our cave person bodies were just not meant for Liquor. Grateful I don't have to apologize for what I did last night. Grateful I remember it. While not totally proud of myself (I definitely asserted my Assesment of the situation), I was able to at least understand her (flawed) rationalization before I lit her up like the fourth of July. 

For my BM, I sent her some choice words in anger. That I regret, because the more I learn about sobriety and recovery, the more I understand the cycle of addiction. It starts and ends with pain. And by using angry words I'm not helping her, or myself. Or our son.

I thought I'd share this little story and lesson I learned today. Thanks for reading.

It's 7am on the east coast and the kid isn't awake yet, BM isn't home yet, but she's at least apologized and taken ownership. So that's something.

1972,2021-08-18 04:50:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p6nat4/my_snowball_effect_changes/,My snowball effect changes.,"Hi all! I would like to share a short story with you all. How misfortune and some lies helped change my life.

I started drinking alcohol at the age of 14-15 when my parents and extended family started throwing us (teenagers) beer and vodka at family gatherings. They had kind of laugh that they are ""the cool ones"" and it turned out every uncle wanted to be cool and bring us some alcohol in secrecy.

Couple of years forward, I had many hangovers and parties to be a regular drinker (not like every day but the beer was very regular).

When I started working after university, I drank fairly regularly, mostly wine in the evening or a couple of beers. Still when I attended family parties or company parties they were full of whisky and vodka. I always ended with a hangover.

Here I am almost 15 years later. I had knee surgery 1,5 months ago and the doctor forbids me from drinking for 6 weeks. I used this as an excuse to not drink again. I told my friend and family that it takes about a year to heal completely for a knee (which is true) and I shouldn't drink for this time (which isn't true xD). So I bought myself a year without nagging me to drink. I would like to use it to accustom others to my new state and never drink again.

&#x200B;

About the title: Since I had a surgery, despite being handicapped for some time I managed to do so much in my life. I bought an apartment, I'm on time with my work, I'm sleeping at least 8 hours every night, I eat less processed food :).",10,0
1973,2021-08-18 04:45:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p6n8x3/a_few_thoughts/,A few thoughts,"There may be a couple of unpopular thoughs but:

1) I don't think I'm alcoholic (although there are times were functionally I was). I was and have been and hopefully will not be again a problem drinker. I had a bad relationship with alcohol, drinking too often and not stopping and has effected my life. I think this distinction is important because in order to confront my issues with alcohol I need to be honest about what they are and that's why I don't care for the idea that you have to admit you're alcoholic and powerless over alcohol. Certainly I felt a lot more able to confront the issue when I realised that I was not simply in a dichotomy of fine or alcoholic. I admitted I have a poor relationship with alcohol and I have a problem, now I'm working on it.

2) It's hard to face the idea that you'll never drink again and I don't really know why. I mean I've tasted wine and it's nice but so is lobster and I don't get freaked out by the idea that I might not eat it again (crab on the other hand). I do find it easier to think of giving up for six months and recalibrating my relationship with alcohol (abd if that includes not drinking again that's fine). Not really looking for advise there just a thought.

3) Inspite of what I've said above I do feel strong empathy for everyone here who has a truely savage relationship with alcohol and suffers from addiction worse that myself because mate, I've swam in the shallows of that swamp and like anyone who deals with alcohol I know full well I came/could come to drowning. I'm glad so many people come here to try and take control and I draw a lot of strength from everyone here.

4) Life is better when you acknowledge that you have a problem with drink. It's easier to take responsibility and though initially it feels shameful it's better to contront that demon and step past it.

5) Alcohol has not ruined my recent life but in many ways it has defined it. Putting my life in a broader context I think I'm ready to do something else.

6) Lurking here helps. I came here months ago and lurked for a while then one morning (5 days ago) I realised that I was done with booze. Now I'm here multiple times a day engaging with the community. I don't know why but it helps so much to hear from people at all stages and just not deal with this alone and yet also away from all other areas of my life. (I have discussed this with my wife though).

I hope you have a pleasant day. Coffee, tea and squash.",3,0

Reality hitting,"All this time I thought my drinking problem was contained to just the last several years. If anything I remember months it wasn't a problem but wasn't it? Was it normal to sneak drinks and hide gin in water bottles because I wasn't 'being problematic' or hurting anyone? I was. I was hurting myself. Was it normal that I would tell my friends to go on without me on trip so I can rest and by rest order 3 or 4 glasses of wine before dinner?

The truth is this issue of mine whether it was heightened or softened by my ability in the earlier years to keep it hidden has been around for thirteen years. Yes. Thirteen years.

Even when it wasn't obvious to me I had a problem it was clear I always drank faster, drank more than most around me. I was bount to land here. So much could have been avoided had I just seen that being seen as a fun drunk, having my personality buffer the truth evaded me from the truth which was I wasn't well. I have lost so much time medicating my depression, putting on a smile while I have been crying inside. 
Thirteen years of avoiding myself. Day 11 today and I hope the next thirteen years will allow me to know myself, all of it and give me the platform to rise above everything I tried to avoid and deal with it.

It¬¥s life itself unfolding, with hundreds of people setting out to meet it sober. It¬¥s humbling and awe-inspiring.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Some Wednesday thoughts on mourning

It‚Äôs a very common perception that when you get sober, you‚Äôll automagically have the Pink Cloud Experience^TM and enjoy Bliss^TM and newfound Happiness^TM . And yeah, maybe. But this sub is full of people who just don‚Äôt share that experience.

I felt pretty miserable when I was drinking. When I got sober, I had to feel all the feels, only without the numbness and relief, and for safe measure a lot of feels that I had tried to drown came floating back. I had forgotten them, they had obviously not forgotten me. Hm.

When I‚Äôm existentially tired, I mourn the life I didn‚Äôt get. I mourn the dreams, the missed opportunities, the what ifs. Being fortyish and with a few complicating factors in my life I still work on that, but I suspect that quite a few what ifs would have been there regardless of my drinking.

Quitting drinking was like breaking up with the love of my life. An abusive, selfish, careless lover, but nonetheless - we had a lot of fun, and I could always count on her soothing me, or kicking me in the head, for that matter. I realized that I had to mourn even that. Weird, huh.

But today, I mourn a little, and I celebrate a lot. The future I got is so much more than the past I lost. I will not drink with you today!

I'm currently looking for full-time employment while working on a side project.

No cloudy memories, no racing heart at 3am, no wondering if it was obvious I drank more than anyone else. 

A few weeks into sobriety I felt like I was living in harmony externally with who I felt like I was internally, and I didn‚Äôt feel the urge to handicap my personality with alcohol anymore. Drunk me was not an enhanced me! What a fucking realization. I like who I am unaltered. I like proving to myself that I‚Äôm still dorky, funny and relaxed without a buzz. I like learning new things about myself, like the fact that I‚Äôm a morning person and that I‚Äôm very generous when my energy isn‚Äôt spent on nursing hangovers. I like going to bed early, I like ordering Shirley temples. 

I‚Äôm finished with what I used to call fun, the fleeting excitement of what may happen on one night..followed by alcohol
Withdrawal and hazy memories. I‚Äôm living for the girl I wake up in the mornings and like being, I am finally happy.",29,0

There was a power outage after work.
I only buy enough beer for that night but I was so worried that I couldn't get alcohol on the way home. 
I blew family and friends off. I wanted to sit and watch TV while avoiding anything unpleasant, chilled beer in hand slowly fading away.
Just checking the clock to try to stay awake till around 9 and I could finally get a ""good night's rest"" which was anything but I digress.

But this time I'm almost off my job and the power is out and I can't get liquor. 
I can't listen to music and have beer I can't go for a walk and have beer I can't talk with friends and have beer but if I don't have beer the soul of what I am doing is empty.
I am empty. I look at my sober friends and they like movies and walks and conversation with friends but if I'm not buzzed I can't be human. 

I am not even comfortable with beer in my hand. There is no calm in the present I don't even feel at rest. As soon as I've finished my beer I have to make some BS excuse about how nice of a night it is and I'm an ""active"" guy so I am just going for the walk. But maybe I'll end up at the liquor store. 

I'm a sentimental type and I grew up (like all of you) with teeny bop movies of over drinking being related to good night's but when the music died down and those nights are getting far and few in between. I am wrestling with the reality that I am spending every single moment wishing I was in another moment. When I am at work I want to be at home buzzed or drunk. When I am drunk I want more, when I have more I want to be in bed unconscious. I never want to be here. 


Today marks my third week of being sober. I'm sitting reading books on alcohol and how to quit it and I am comfortable. I don't have to rush out to the liquor store or check the time that I'm drinking early enough that my buzz has to last and be worth it. I'm not making sure I'm staying up late enough so I can have piss poor sleep. 
I'm drinking tea and reading a book and being at peace with present more than I have in a long time. 
The heart of the moment is here with me and I don't have to drink another beer to keep it with me. 
It's not fleeting. It's not always one more beer away.
I'm excited for sleep tonight. I'm going to have a good sleep.

Also, is there anything that others do to show support or check in on you that you find helpful? I feel bad that I can't offer as much face to face support as if she lived close to me, but I also don't want her to feel as if I'm trying to babysit or control her",5,0

I found this subreddit today and I'm posting in hopes writing it down i can hold myself accountable and truly commit to stop drinking.


For years I have been unable to cut myself off and I drink to the point of blacking out the majority of the time. I wake up with hardly any recollection of the previous evening, sometimes with bruises and scraps on my body I'm too embarrassed to ask what happened. I arrive late to work, sometimes miss it, because my car is at a bar somewhere. My friends got tired of constantly driving me and I don't blame them. 


I'm tired of constantly feeling like shit, waking up and not knowing what I said or did the night before. Did I embarrass myself? Did I hurt anyone? Was I an ass? Before I could brush it off because I was a happy, loud drunk. I had fun and didn't hurt anyone. Lately, I've become aggressive and emotional, and I can ignore it no longer. I do not want to be a burden on my friends.

My only fear is that I will become boring to the people I hang around. I'll become quite and less confident (yes, I used alcohol for that ""liquid courage""). Everyone knows me as the one to go to the bar on the evenings, always love to go out drinking, and get trashed. We hang out a lot at breweries, bars, cookouts. All have alcohol. Will I be able to handle it? I guess there's only one way to find out. I just hope it is not too late and that my friends will understand.

I think what's really pushing me is weight gain. At first it was just the pandemic stopping me from leaving the house but the liquor started adding up as I became more dependent. I did some math and I've been averaging at least 600 calories a day of liquor. Ouch... and that's not even counting all the nighttime snacks or hangover cravings that I always regret immediately.

So today I went 4 miles on the elliptical machine, counted every calorie I ate, and even though I'm sleeping even worse, I feel really good about things. Hopeful about having the energy to really pursue my health and career goals. I'm not adding any liquor to this app (or my mouth) tonight.",4,1

Little things like this are a stark contrast to drinking times. Forget moisturizing before bed- many times I never even took off my makeup.

And then, just like that, here we are.

There have been so many points where I have had opportunities and clearance to drink, and no one except myself to hold me accountable, but I haven't given into any of them. It used to be a conscious choice I had to make to not drink, now it's almost second nature. I understand myself just that much better, to be able to know that if I start drinking, I won't be able to stop. It has helped me garner self control and responsibility for my actions. It has led me to examine other addictions in my life and I have started to root them out too.

When the urge to drink comes back, and it does from time to time I imagine it never fully goes, it hits as hard as it did on Day 1. But that urge comes less and less often now, and it actually is easier to say no to it, because I have the reinforcement from so many other times I've said no backing up my decision. A single no was all it took to start the journey.

So, to those out there restarting Day 1 with a foggy hangover looming over their head, IWNDWYT. For all those Day 7s, detoxing and feeling like they are going out of their minds, IWNDWYT. For all the Day 14,593s who have infinitely more knowledge than myself but may still need to hear it, IWNDWYT. The last year would not have been possible for me without any of you.

Yesterday marked the longest I've been sober in the last 6 years. 2 weeks and 1 day.,"I was never the type of person that thought I needed to give up drinking. I'd have stints of 4 or 5 months at a time of drinking more than half a bottle of vodka a night. But as long as I could give it up for 2 weeks, a week, maybe a few days at a time, I could easily convince myself that I wasn't an alcoholic. Because alcoholics are only people that can't function without it. People whose social lives and work lives are dramatically shifted and disintegrated. People who blackout regularly and can never get home from a party. Right? 

Turns out, that was me lying to myself and turning on my brain's airplane mode so I didn't get notifications of what I was actually doing to myself. 

Sure. I'm not as bad as some people. I don't get the shakes when I stop. I don't get headaches. I don't get sick. I'd get a bit irritable but that was just par for the course. 

The problem was, I was using the people that have it the worst as a metric to determine when I've gone too far. Like I was going to wait until it's gotten so bad that I could see the issue from the outside and force myself to change. But I already wasn't doing that. Letting my future deal with the past. 

The moment I had really noticed that I was heading down a steep slope, was when I realized that my prize for not drinking for 2 weeks, a week or a few days, was a drink. 2 drinks. 10. My prize for doing tasks I had been putting off was alcohol. My prize for going to social events I didn't want to attend was alcohol. My prize for going to work? You guessed it. Alcohol. 

When I came around to realize that I had a real problem, I started becoming more vocal about it. Some people told me it wasn't that bad. Some people suggested I try to develop a more healthy relationship with it. Only drinking a day or two a week. But I can't do that. It's all or nothing. Either I drink every day. Or not at all. 2 weeks and 2 days ago was the moment I decided that ""not at all"" was the right choice. 

I'm gonna wrap this up so it doesn't get too lengthy. The hardest part about about quitting anything, for me at the very least, is the idea of never doing it again. But even harder than that was thinking about getting a girlfriend, getting married, having kids and wondering how I was going to hide this part of myself from people that don't even love me yet. 

I don't want to give myself to anyone else with a caveat. 

I don't want to live my life with a caveat. 

When I told my roommate and long time friend that I had quit drinking, he hugged me and told me he was proud of me. 

And if you just quit drinking or are really trying to make that turning point in your life, then I'm proud of you too. 

Don't wait for the moment it's gone too far. Give yourself a you you can be proud of. You deserve it.

Probably to do with the meds I'm on, but even when I mitigate blacking out, there's still this spiral of observations concerning why we all drink so much and why it's so socially acceptable and why I seem to be the only one of my friends having a hard time with it. At times, I have these ""red pill"" moments where I see drinking and alcohol as these ridiculous constructs I've just accepted and inherited and stumbled around under for a while with my fellow sheeple. But then other times, I think to myself, well it's not thaaaaaat big a deal to just have it in moderation.  Plus, it's fun! That's the problem though: I can only really exist in either extreme, making moderation feel like a less viable option. And then there's the main problem: I just don't want to give it up. How do you even take that first step? I don't want to have to wait to hit rock bottom in order to change/redefine my relationship with drinking.

I don't think AA will help me do any of this while instead of going to the gym or checking out a special interest group I feel guilty cause I ""should be at a meeting"" or something. 

I don't like that they made reset my sobriety date because I wanted to try to use medical cannabis. (Not here to argue about medical cannabis.) 

I haven't drank since August 10, 2019 and for that I am thankful. 

I got a great job this year. But several of my coworkers and CEO go the homegroup meeting that my sponsor and sponsorship family started going go recently. 

My coworker broke my anonymity infront of another Co worker on Friday asking if I went to that meeting. (Which I did not, I really needed to go home and rest after work)

I dont think he did it on purpose but it didn't make me feel very good as I prefer to be discrete. 

I would really like to invest time in the gym, schooling, and other spiritual groups than go to AA and deal with all the things I don't agree with. I'm just trying to get a degree and move out of my parents house and spending all my time in AA won't help that. 

But I'm afraid to leave because I'm afraid that my coworkers will say I relapsed or that my sponsor will think I relapsed and nasty rumors or social/professional consequences will ensue if I leave.

If i did drink, I wouldn‚Äôt do anything different than what I‚Äôm doing now, but my brain is telling me that it would be ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù, and I would ‚Äúrelax‚Äù. I‚Äôm using the play-it-forward thought process that I see posted a lot. 

If I did drink I would probably over eat. I would get too many calories from the alcohol. I would worry about forgetting things my husband said to me, and probably actually forget things he would say to me. I would worry if I said or did something annoying or embarrassing. I would snore and keep my husband awake. I would probably be hungover in the morning and sit on my bed too long and be late for work. I would feel crappy and dehydrated all morning. I would have to reset my counter on my sobriety app which would be, and is, disappointing to see. 

None of that is good, and all for what?? Having ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù while watching tiktoks???

Hey new user here, willing to share a story..

I'm 25 and have been very drunk at least 5 times every months since turning 16-17.. 

Although I'm a big guy, I am a light weight and always the first one to fall asleep or the only one that falls over and injures themselves...in fact a couple years ago I ended up in hospital 3 times within 10 months due to accidental/deliberate injuries under the influence. 

I did Sober October last year and felt great (relied on AF beers every weekend though). Only reason I drank again was as I set myself a target to not drink until Halloween as we had a party planned with some old friends...

Fast forward another few months and I find myself binge drinking regularly, as it would often start with hair of a dog following a heavy Friday night...I even started drinking half tumblers of spirits (in some way thinking this was a 'sophisticated' way to drink). 

I tried moderation a few months ago as my issues with alcohol are regarding the spending of money, health (long term and short term) and also not being able to control my limits and ending up sleeping on the floor somewhere (which occurs like 1/4 of the time)...For over a month I did really well drinking 4-5 drinks a week (1-2 each day over the weekend). In hindsight this whole ""hipster"" way of drinking craft beer and believing I was some kind of ""beer taster"" was a mask for my dependency on alcohol..  Sometime after though I went back to my old ways and carried on getting wasted...

Hit rock bottom 1 month ago when after another morning of waking up on the floor my fiancee of 4 years said for the millionth time ""I'm going to break up with you if you carry on. You are an embarrassment and an alcoholic. Everyone laughs at you and not with you"". Dont know why but that particular hit me really hard and I nearly cried. I promised to her and myself that I would stop after our 2 week holiday and music (Bloodstock) festival as I knew I wouldn't be able to do it and so I didn't want to give false promises.

Anyway, came back from the festival yesterday and I'm excited for the future and to really make her and more importantly myself, proud of my ability to refuse alcohol. I'm not saying I'm definitely quitting but definitely taking an indefinite hiatus with alcohol and will not force myself to drink on special occasions or when it's ""socially acceptable"" to do so. I'm hoping that if I do not completely stop then at least I will have more respectful, mature relationship with alcohol, whenever that time comes.. but if I find myself failing at moderation then that will really prove to me that ""our relationship"" has no place in my life.

Roll on the future as only good will come out of this :)",6,1

It's still crazy to think of it like that. The last few weeks have certainly been interesting.  I'm seeing how much I let alcohol hold me back over many years: it's impact on a past marriage, performance at past jobs, lost opportunities and thousands of dollars frivolously spent. I even once walked away from a ""dream job"" because I just couldn't handle it. That one is still tough to swallow.  I'm incredibly glad I've reached this milestone, I intend to keep this going and I'm hopeful for the future and my personal growth.  But, damn, I'm also left with a heavy heart as I look back and think of what my life could have been, where I could be now and a part of me just wishes I could go back and make it right.  But, I know dwelling on that is not productive, so I'm trying to shift my mind to focus on what I can learn from it all and how I can move forward. I'm also seeing how much fear has dominated my life since a very young age and how I latched on to alcohol to self medicate my anxiety and part of me forgives my younger self for just trying to get by. I'm now addressing the monster that's loomed over my shoulder most of my life through more positive avenues and am hopeful to find ways to live my life without letting anxiety have control over me.  I'm no spring chicken and I feel as though I'm looking at my life almost with new eyes, thinking about what I want for myself, rather than settling for what gets me by.  It's a strange place to be, especially at my age, and it feels both exciting and uncomfortable at the same time.

My toxic relationship with alcohol started  two years ago when I was pressured by my then bf to abort. I did that and I have never been the same since. I am a recovering  drug addict and I did relapse after the procedure. But I'm proud to say I'm a year clean from drugs right now and also I am 16 days sober from alcohol. Okay my point is I used alcohol as a crutch after I knew that relapsing is not an option anymore and will never be. I thought to myself "" I can drink but I can't use"" . So my alcohol use became out of control. Yesterday my ex boyfriend came over unannounced and I was forced to let him sleep over (on the floor also because it was too late for him to take a taxi and he was intoxicated) . I used to drink with him a lot. I remember at some point we bought 4 bottles of wine , 2 bottles of whisky and 24 pack of cider and we finished all of that in a weekend. He is definitely my biggest trigger. Leaving alcohol 16 days ago was also a matter of us breaking up. My16 day sobriety was also possible in his absence. Yesterday he was begging me to take him back and I had already made up my mind. I am on meds (quietipine 100mg) I fell dead asleep in the night and he  took my phone and texted a guy that I'm currently pursuing . He told him to back off and I woke up alone (he left in the wee hours of the morning) and to multiple confused texts from my new admirer. I was so tempted to drink as my step dad is an alcoholic and always has beer and spirits in the house. As I was cooking, stressed out and heartbroken I was so tempted to pick up the bottle and fix myself a drink and I did not. I remembered that it won't be easy and my current goal is to make it to 30 days sober. I decided not to drink and I just went on here to check how other colleagues are doing.

He has some undiagnosed mental health issues as well as a diagnosed one that he takes a medication for (not that he cares, but the label on the pills says DO NOT MIX WITH ALCOHOL). Every time he drinks, he turns into a completely different person. The last time he got abusive, I told him it was his very last chance. Well, guess what happened last night. I told him that if he drove his car intoxicated I would call the police, and he LOST IT. He called me somethings that I don't even want to repeat. I kicked him out and he left in an Uber to go talk shit with his friend Dave. Fortunately, I am safe, and I am sober.

I think we are done. I can't do this anymore. I won't let alcohol ruin my life anymore, especially when I have worked so fucking hard to stop. I will never go back to that bottle because all it wants to do is kill me. I just wish that Jim would see that the booze doesn't love him back, it just wants him sick and dependent on it. I love this man so much, when he's sober he's the nicest, sweetest, most loving partner I could ever hope for, but when he's drunk he is a monster.

It hurts to blink. He shirked his responsibilities for today and dumped them all on me so that he could go party. Not like I have a full work week and he's got a week off or anything!! /s

I have to enforce the boundaries that I put in place. It's so fucking hard but I have to do it or he will never take anything that I say seriously ever again. I would never have gotten married if I thought that it would end like this.

Not perfect but you don't have a fucking mountain to overcome every time you have a problem.  You just have the problem.  I feel really secure in my sobriety but that doesn't erase the fear of knowing how easy it is to slip up and lose it.

To the people just starting their journey: I am so proud of you. The first 6 months were incredibly difficult for me and that is when you really have to work. Constant maintenance of new habits can be exhausting and if you slip up don't beat yourself up. You've already laid ground work for starting again.

I first started to get sober in February or early March (time and dates were a bit fuzzy then) and I mark Sept 1 as my sober date; so you can see there was a bit of starting and stopping and starting again.

Truth be told drinking was not working back in the winter, hadn't been for quite a while I later understood.  The slips I allowed myself were not really much fun, and in fact I spent much of them beating myself up for drinking, but I couldn't, it seemed, go all the way through the doorway into a new sober life.

Was I afraid of success?      
Did the debris I was going to have to face scare me?        
Did the rut I had spent so much time digging and furnishing still seem safer than the emotions I was feeling in my sober streaks?      

Yes.  And I am sure there was more.

And in that limbo I was miserable.  I went to AA meetings and felt like a failure.  Thing is that feeling like a failure was something I had been doing for so long I was comfortable in it.  It was a piece of furniture in my rut.

I allowed myself to drink - a reaction to 'don't tell me what to do' being my middle name.  And a postponing of what I knew to be the inevitable.

But this time felt different.  I had proven I could not moderate too many times to count - not with this, not with that, not with switching to weed, I always ended up over doing it - and feeling shitty about myself. (I am exceedingly lucky I got away with as much as I did)

So here I am 34 years later still wondering why it took so long to ""get it"" to allow myself to start living a much better life, to start feeling better about myself and then reading the posts of those still struggling - and I remember.  

Keep coming back, that's the only thing I can say.  One of these times it will get easier.  One of these times the lies we tell ourselves will not get believed.  One of these times can be the start of something so much better (not that there won't still be work) but it will all be worth it.",17,0

I've been reading through This Naked Mind and I really do think that's been helping a lot - paints a great perspective of how alcohol is poisoning you in many ways and avoiding that can only improve your life. My stomach is still getting back on track. I'm drinking a lot more water, switched over to sugar-free sodas and ginger beer, and I've been pounding the seltzer water. I still often feel bloated, so I'm hoping that goes away soon. Sleeps have been more restful, and when my mind isn't racing I fall asleep much faster. I'm down a couple pounds just from cutting the extra garbage nighttime calories, and I've been slowly ramping up more frequent exercise by walking at least a mile every other day. My resting heart rate has come down about 10bpm already from all those positive changes.

Things are getting way tougher this week due to some big and miserable changes in my life. I have to say goodbye to my dog today. Knew it was coming for a while and that she'll be better off not struggling through each day anymore, but I'm still not prepared. I've been fighting back tears constantly the last two days - it just flat out sucks, and I'm worried about having to adjust to not having a dog for the first time in my life. I'm gonna miss my friend. It just hurts so much.

I also recently learned that one of my grandparents is now going through late-stage organ failure. Fought through cancer and complications years ago, and now will be fighting through more medical battles going forward.

So, clearly I'm going through it today. I'm stressed and crying. I didn't sleep well at all last night and woke up today with a headache. My stomach is bothering me even more - swallowing all the tears and sniffles probably doesn't help. But I don't feel like drinking. I don't feel like anything right now. I haven't had to deal with loss and change like this in a very long time and I'm having a hard time processing it all.

I'll make sure I try to eat today and drink more water. I still just want the bloating to go away and start feeling even more back to normal even sooner after all of this. Drinking is the least of my concerns right now. I know I have a great support system of all my friends to try and get me through the changes right now, and I know I could use more support and reassurance here from my Reddit friends.",10,0

I went out with a big group for dinner, wine started flowing, and I had one, thinking that hey, I haven't been to a big dinner like this in forever. I successfully stopped drinking at home by myself. I've got this. I'll try this as an experiment.

I finished the night with 3 glasses. It might have been fun if I was never a problem drinker. I guess it was kinda fun, but just because it was a fun, boisterous dinner. And boy, after 2, I was loaded. Time without drinking changed me and I can really see why tolerance is a bad thing.

Where has the time gone??,"I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs been 40 days since my last drink. It just seems like it‚Äôs gone by so quickly. At first, I was really concerned about my ability to stay sober. I‚Äôve been making excuses for years. But I just kept repeating to myself out loud that I am an alcoholic. Actually admitting it to myself really was the first step here. Just as I‚Äôve always heard. And it‚Äôs funny, because my friends and family (and even my own husband) don‚Äôt think I have a problem and don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm attempting to stick with this long-term. But it‚Äôs likely because most of my friends and family drink about the same amount of wine as I do. And I know the quantity doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs not a contest - but the massive anxiety that came along with it just wasn‚Äôt worth it. Was the tingling I‚Äôve noticed neuropathy or was it related to my chronic health anxiety? Probably anxiety, as my tests and scans have all been fine so I doubt it‚Äôs physical. But it was enough to scare me straight. At least for now. Because I‚Äôll never say that I‚Äôm going to be sober forever. I don‚Äôt like living with limitations and I feel like that is why I avoided this sober journey for so long. So the key to success does really seem to be one day at a time. I can‚Äôt believe how clich√© I used to think these things were, because something has finally clicked and I see that it really was this simple all along. I feel like I have the life back in me and my eyes are so clear it‚Äôs almost shocking when I look at myself in the mirror. But I am immensely grateful for each day that I wake up sober.

I realized this morning, as my head is throbbing, that I need outside accountability. 

I am a high functioning alcoholic and I‚Äôve known that for years. I‚Äôve tried moderation management, went to AA for a few months about six years ago, was prescribed naltrexone (which was amazing while it worked but then I swear it stopped working), read so much quit lit, am in therapy, journal and exercise daily, etc. All that to say: nothing has worked. I cannot control this addiction. 

About two months ago, my ten year relationship fell apart. My fianc√© moved out and I now find myself alone (feel very utterly alone many times throughout the day!) for the first time in my life. I have never not been in a long term relationship. Never lived alone as an adult. And I‚Äôm using alcohol now to cope. This is a bad situation because now no one sees my drinking. I can hide it completely. I might feel shame but it‚Äôs only me who sees it, and my brain now knows that the only way to get rid of shame is to numb it. I‚Äôm stuck deep in the drink-shame-drink cycle.  I very much want a change. 

So, some questions: how do you communicate your recovery to others? I work in a very drink heavy environment and all my friends are also colleagues. They don‚Äôt know about my inner demons. And how do you wrap your mind around the idea of not drinking for the rest of your life? That gets my anxiety amped up and, well, I‚Äôm sure many of you know from experience that the best (really worst) medicine for anxiety comes in liquid form.

A reflection and some lessons I've learned,"This last year has been unlike any other. Well, it might be like a lot of others, but I actually remember most of it for a change.

I spent way too many years believing that I didn't have a problem with alcohol because I could go a day or two without it and didn't get the shakes. I thought that an alcohol problem meant pure addiction like I have experienced with nicotine. It took me being sober for almost 6 months to actually see how unhealthy the world and my view of alcohol had become. 

I find myself surprised and saddened by one of the most common reactions I get when someone finds out that I have stopped drinking: ""I wish I could do that,"" is said to me far more frequently than I ever could imagine. I hear pain in their voices and stories. Like me they hate alcohol but have found a place where they believe it has to live in their lives and they can't make it go away. It is one of the worst lies that we have fallen for. 

I've learned that the people I was most afraid to see or tell are those that don't want to face their own unhealthy relationship with alcohol, and most importantly I've learned how to spot that and handle it. 

I've learned from my experience that it can take a lot of attempts before actually getting sober. I've learned from you all that a year or two or five of sobriety doesn't make you invincible to screwing it up and thinking it's ok to drink again. But most importantly I've learned that this is a safe place to come back to even after making a mistake. 

I haven't been too vocal here, but I've been here almost every single day for the last year and I attribute much of my success to this group. Keep at it. Keep coming back when you make a mistake. Keep trying. One day at a time. Today, on day 365, I Will Not Drink With You Today!",213,0

I've just realized in the past month that the alcohol and drugs were masking the reality of the household I grew up in, the abuse I sustained, and the hatred I internalized. It's really bad. I really bought their message that I was uniquely horrible and deserving of the treatment I got. Now I see it all for what it was. It's really different to remember those things in the 1000-watt clarity of sobriety. Drinking really dulled it and made it easier to deny. I was easy to manipulate and guilt trip as an alcoholic, so I have been in touch with my family, and go to most of their events. There's no way to un-see these things now though, or pretend it's not real.

I'm reaching out here as a new effort to see if it helps me clear a month. This struggle has been going on for too long and I want to end the misery. I have a podcast saved on my phone about quitting and plan on using it. If anyone has any other ideas or tricks to crush the cravings I'd sure like to hear about them. Thanks,8,0

Nothing awful, just another little bit of hope dashed from my life. I applied for my dream job the other week, a particularly rare role that probably won't come up again for at least another few years, and I didn't even get to the first round of interviews. I really was amped up by the prospect of having a job where I would actually be excited to go into work each day, unlike the current daily grind. It wasn't crazily out of my league either, I would have been very capable of doing the job.

For the most part, I don't feel like I have much to be hopeful about, and when I do get excited for the possibility of things, I do my best to not get my hopes up too much, because the outcome is usually the same. I have a terrible habit of getting ahead of myself with the possibilities of ideas, and this inevitably leads to disappointment. It is something I'm actively working on, and so far it's been a tough balancing act. Not having anything to hope for is a clear path back to daily drinking, but crushing defeats will send me back there as well.

Anyway, right now I'm feeling the hit of this latest defeat and I'd like to have a couple of beers, sit on the couch and forget about life for a while, maybe watch a baseball game or something. So the question I have to ask myself at the moment is whether I should cave to this moment of weakness and get back on the horse tomorrow, or just push through this bad time and try to find something else to be happy about?

There is clearly a right and wrong answer here, but that doesn't really make it easier to decide which one to choose, if that makes any sense...",6,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Johnny Cash taught me that I can¬¥t drink.

Not in person, obviously, but at the beginning of his autobiography (1997), the aging man gives the following gratitude:

""Finally, I¬¥m thankful, very thankful, that at this moment I have absolutely no craving for any kind of drug. I¬¥ve been up almost three hours today, and this is the first time I¬¥ve thought about it, and even then it¬¥s in the spirit of gratitude. So my disease isn¬¥t active. Last night I saw a bottle of wine passed around the table, and I never once thought about taking even a sip of it. (So why am I thinking about it now? Watch it, Cash! Gotta never be complacent. Never take anything for granted. Don¬¥t forget, great prices have been paid and will be paid again if you get too smug, too egotistical and self-assured.)""

It¬¥s been many years since I first read this, but it still sticks. It was the first time someone spoke into my life about drinking, and it changed my entire view on it. Cash struggled with addiction his whole life, but he also proved that you can go to hell and back. We are a whole lot of people on the road back.

I will not drink with you fine people today!",209,0

I have been playing procrastination this summer - giving myself an ""out"" to keep drinking, partying, ""get it out of my system"" one last time before I behave like an adult and quit drinking for good. Im 37, have 4 kids, recently separated, also recovering from the worst heart break (not the ex husband) and so I let myself continue to cope and escape in an unhealthy way - by drinking.  I have tried to cut back in the past, but it seems every time I take a break, there is a social event, a girl's weekend, a vacation, a birthday party, even just having family over for dinner - all heavily fueled by alcohol. This last week I went on a quick getaway with a friend and it was my last ""hurrah.""  Well it sure was, we drank way more than I have in recent memory, I hooked up with 2 random guys and there are bits and pieces of the week I can't recall. My girlfriend and I laughed at some of our ridiculous stories but the truth is I don't like that version of myself. 

I read in an old thread that someone thought they had anxiety and depression but they were really just in constant alcohol withdrawal and I think that is exactly where I am.  I don't want to deal with my emotions / feelings and it's an escape to party and have the mindset ""i'll deal with those problems tomorrow.""  I think i have been heartbroken for the last 2 years, and I now realize I am the one who keeps breaking my own heart. 

Im very curious about spontaneous sobriety.  I read this from Annie Grace - they key to spontaneous sobriety is 

1. The Lotus of Control: the belief that I can do this
2. Take the shame and blame out: Accept that ups and downs are part of the process
3. New non-stigmatized Identity (of a non drinker)

""Living by default to living by Design."" 

So the cringe worthy memories of being wasted, and the knowledge that the alcohol may be the exact cause of my anxiety is fuel enough for me to stop. 

The biggest motivation is purely selfish - I'll never heal my broken heart if I keep trying to numb it with alcohol. 

Thanks for reading.  

PS i am cautiously optimist about having a new identity - as a non drinker.  That one has probably been the biggest challenges. I never knew how to address that in social situations or with family / friends, so I would always just drink with them. But kind of excited about it.",24,0

Life has been insane and stressful and emotionally triggering lately. And my coping mechanism of drinking has kicked into high gear.

The thing is, I really dont want to relapse. But I *do* want to relapse. But the idea of relapsing makes me want to cry. Giving up my hard won progress, back to day 1, becoming a liar and hypocrite once again, is really really not what I want. But I *still* want to relapse.

I'm so angry and frustrated with myself! 

I've finally been walking the talk, living my life much more on par with how I want to; exercising, eating better, doing my hobbies, not withdrawing into my room and cutting off my family.

Why cant I just stick to what I know is right? Why do I always have to fight with my own better judgement and make everything harder for myself? 

I'm just sick of it, and I cant see a way out. If I give into temptation, then I'm back in the grip of addiction. If I hold out, I'm still stuck craving and denying and waiting for it to get better with no real evidence that it will. I need a third option and I have no idea how to find it.

I knew I needed to quit way back then but thought ""nah man, I ain't one of THOSE types. I can control it."" Then I had a huge dose of reality hit me like a truck. I was stupid lucky. Never got caught or got into trouble from the law for my past drinking. Figured all was well, you know? I didn't need to worry because I was good at drinking alone at home or not getting caught on the rare occasion I did go out.

The wake up call for me was my girlfriend of 7 years who I love unconditionally telling me she wants to separate. That was hard to take...however, it was even harder to take when she told me that she's been feeling this way for over 2 years because of my bad drinking habits. I didn't realize, despite her multiple warnings, how serious she was about how bad my drinking habits hurt her. I got too comfortable and thought things were good since I only binged one day a week, rarely two. 

The complicated part is that she's found someone else she can confide it that helped show her how unhappy she was with me. It wasn't right how she went about it but who am I to blame her when I didn't heed her calls to quit drinking and see a therapist. 

I'm currently 28 days sober. Never thought I'd be able to say that. The first two weeks were very difficult but it has gotten so much easier. I started off doing this for her but I finally came to the realization that it's the most important thing for me personally. Drinking has made my anxiety worse, my health worse, my friendships worse, and now obviously cost me a relationship with a woman that I love so dearly. What made quitting easier was reading posts from this subreddit and seeing many people that I could easily relate to over the past few years. It helped get me to the point that I am now where I can accept it.

Things are still rough right now but at least I am able to think clearly and live with my own thoughts instead of having to ""drown"" them out. It wasn't easy but it most certainly is getting easier.",11,0

Just looking for some tips on how to combat the loneliness that seems to come with being sober. I‚Äôm VERY happy to be sober - just over 6 months now - and I wouldn‚Äôt trade waking up every day sober and the ability to finally enjoy life for anything. I got my dream job (that I lost once about 6 years ago due to my severe drinking problem), I have a wonderful supportive family and great friends. I like to think I‚Äôm funny, have a big heart and am low-key and drama free.  I am single, have my 15 year old son half of the time (Friday - Monday usually) and once he‚Äôs gone I have this‚Ä¶void. I don‚Äôt have anywhere to go or anyone to do things with. All of my friends drink, and it took A LOT at first to stay sober when around them. Now I don‚Äôt even notice that I‚Äôm the only one not drinking. I live in a small-ish town that doesn‚Äôt ever have a whole lot going on. Back in the day, if I was feeling lonely or bored, I‚Äôd saddle up to the bar and pick up a conversation with someone. 

I‚Äôm not huge on AA, but I‚Äôm to the point where I want to find people to relate to or do things with so badly that I‚Äôm considering going, just for that purpose. 

I am 40 now and started drinking when I was about 19. In all those years, i have seriously quit drinking about 6 times. I only ever made it just under 9 months sober, then would let my guard down and talk myself into having ‚Äújust a couple‚Äù ‚Ä¶ well we all know how well that works out. 

I feel like my next couple months, and how I handle this lonely feeling, are going to be crucial to my continued sobriety. I am not looking to get in to a relationship, but definitely would like a pal.

How have you handled these feelings? Can anyone who has been here, done this, relate? #IWNDWYT",43,0

Bonus was the two kg weight loss (once I‚Äôd got over the initial carb cravings).

At the risk of exposing identity I‚Äôll try to keep some details to a minimum.

Covid hit me hard, y‚Äôall. I gave birth to our first baby all alone (after struggling with infertility) and spent ~a year by myself raising my perfect angel baby (military reasons). Well, I survived that and my spouse is finally home with us and we‚Äôve started to rebuild our lives (some martial issues from our time spent apart but we are in counseling). Before, I had what‚Äôs called kratom available to me and I didn‚Äôt drink at all. But now we are overseas and all I have available is alcohol to help me deal with my stress and anxiety. I shouldn‚Äôt need a substance to help cope, I know. Maybe that‚Äôs my addictive personality? I really don‚Äôt know but that makes me sad to think about.

The problem is now I feel like I need to drink to feel happy and get through my day while my spouse is at work. I don‚Äôt know how this addiction developed but it‚Äôs here. I drink probably a bottle of vodka every 2-3 days. I had bloodwork done and my liver enzymes are for shit and my LDL is through the roof. I hide my bottles from my spouse for risk of starting an argument. My problem is starting to spiral and I need to stop it before it gets worse but I don‚Äôt even know the first steps. I need to be a better person for our baby and I‚Äôm scared. 

Tell me how you you started to stop? What methods have worked for you?

Meditation hasn‚Äôt worked, I work out somewhat regularly, and I eat fairly well (though some days I don‚Äôt even have an appetite which is most certainly from the drinking).",8,1
2166,2021-08-16 19:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p5s5is/need_your_help/,Need your help!,"Hello Reddit community. I've been struggling with alcohol pretty heavily for the last almost 5 years. Right after my divorce is when I started drinking again after years of being sober. Over the last 5 years I've had periods of sobriety sometimes upwards of 6 months. This last drinking stretch has lasted almost 2 years of not being able to stop... Or I should say choose to not being able to stop. I just don't understand why I can't put the drink down. I live in a town where I don't have any friends or family and so I'm practically alone almost 100% of the time. I get my kids every other weekend and those are the times where I don't drink. At this point I'm considering AA or celebrate recovery primarily just because I'm missing the community aspect or just having someone to talk to. A little while ago I had two weeks of not drinking when I was visiting family and as soon as I came back to my home, I started drinking again. I feel like part of me wants to do something drastic like move to a new town to get a fresh start. What advice can you guys give me to help me take steps towards fixing this problem. I will say I know some of the underlying issues are loneliness, mild depression, a bit of a midlife crisis, and just not sure where I see my life going. As many of you know, alcohol fixes the problem right in the moment but it creates more problems in the morning.

First: Last night was a train wreck. I slept for probably 3 hours, then woke up and could not get my mind to calm down. It was almost as if I took WAY too many shrooms and just stared at the ceiling. One thought after another, without any control on where my mind went. 

Is this normal? Anyone have any tips for better sleep? I've read melatonin is a bad idea due to dual dependencies, but curious what this community thinks. 

Second: body itches and muscle twitches seem to worsen. Nothing that's unbearable, but definitely seems more sensitive than usual. Mostly the twitching. Just laying in bed, and moving a muscle in the slightest way will cause a twitch. Some more sever than others, but I've noticed my legs seem to twitch more aggressively than any other muscle. 

One thing I've noticed that's really strange with the itches is, one part of my leg seems to itches magnitudes more than anything else. My arms, face, and back get a little itchy here and there, but this one spot on my leg never stops. I've tried washing it multiple times, even anti-itch cream does nothing. 

Has anyone ever noticed this? Any advise on how to make it stop?

Third: I think my face forgot how to relax (lol). When I'm just relaxing, winding down and start to close my eyes, my facial muscles seem to slowly clench and tense up, like I'm trying to squint with my eyes closed. My neck also seems to tense up, but if I roll around enough, I eventually find the right spot, but my tensed facial muscles still persist. This makes it incredibly difficult to fall asleep. 

I assume muscle relaxers are not a good substitute here, so wondering if anyone else has heard of this, or know of any remedies. 

Fourth, and lastly: the ""need"" for a drink hasn't hit yet, so I'm guessing that's a good sign, but still feeling lower, less motivated / enthusiastic about everything. My plan is to just ride it out until I start sleeping normal again. Maybe take my dog on an extra walk or something. But I'm convinced I need rest more than anything, so laying low and reading a book sounds like a good path forward. Let me know if you have any other suggestions.

&#x200B;

I've been lucky in that I've had a partner who's been super supportive and has really made the difference between making it, and not.

&#x200B;

I'm exercising heaps (which is a PITA as we're in lockdown where I am), but walk or run I do at least 5k's a day.  

&#x200B;

I'm in regular AA zooms.  I'm not finding zoom as good as the real thing (I've tried before, years ago), but it's better than nothing.  There's few excuses not to attend when all I have to do is fire up zoom.

I'm focused on gratitude.  I have to work on that, but it's honestly helping.

&#x200B;

I'm sleeping better, first few days were a little rough.  Weird nightmares and the like.  Sleeping tablets helped, but I'm off them now, had a few valium to start with.  Off them too.  I still wake up at 4:30 most days... but that's not a huge problem, I just find things to do.

&#x200B;

The longer I go, the easier it is.  Although I recognise that's just with the 'initial day-to-day' of not taking a drink.  To properly recover and not ever need to drink again is going to be some serious work... I'll prob try and address that through AA, but for now I'm just doing 'one day at a time'.  

&#x200B;

I'm really enjoying some of the differences. The exercise is great, I look forward to a 5k walk.  I have HEAPS less anxiety.  I still worry, but it's more manageable.    I can see a better version of me coming.  Three weeks in the changes are only small from the outside, but I can see big changes coming if I can keep the little incremental ones on the daily.

I abused both alcohol and cocaine for the better part of a decade. I‚Äôve had  breaks here and there that have lasted anywhere from 1 day to 2 years. I‚Äôm really giving it my all this time. But in this moment I‚Äôm having a really hard time to not get up and head to the liquor store. I‚Äôm hoping posting here may help deter me ft doing so. Maybe if I can get through the next couple hours when the store closes the feeling will pass and I won‚Äôt search out a bootlegger. 
I‚Äôve been an emotional,self-sabotaging alcoholic for as long as I can remember. My relationships have suffered greatly over it too. Each and every one of them to be exact. 
I‚Äôve been single for 4 years. My 1st sons father was murdered when I was 8 months pregnant with my second son. The loss of my first love put a huge wedge between my then relationship with the father of my second son. Obviously I was sober when it happened and I stayed sober up until the next year when it was the 1st anniversary of his death. That night I drank and I did coke. I‚Äôve struggled with it ever since. I have made attempts to get clean. And I never used to the point that my kids weren‚Äôt ever taken care of. I do work. My second sons father is not in the picture at all, his ass is in prison now. 
I‚Äôve been a binge drinker for a long time tho. I let things piss me off to a point where I will look at my situation as a reason to drink. The reason I brought being single before my rant was because I‚Äôve often used the men on my life as my main reason to go get drunk. He pissed me off, better get a bottle. He‚Äôs ignoring me, better make that 2. He‚Äôs mad at me now, better drunk text that guy who‚Äôs been talking to himself in my inbox. You get the point. 
So today, the guy I‚Äôve been casually messing around with was busy. Immediately I went into a toxic rage of jealously and I let my past and trust issues take over. I did my toxic idiotic start to my binge behaviour. This is why I stay single. I‚Äôm just not ready. I admitted that. Mind you , he and I have known each other our whole lives. We grew up in the same town. We have been close friends for years. We have told one another that we love each other. I‚Äôm currently sitting at phase 2 where I‚Äôm being ignored. But no I didn‚Äôt go get a bottle.  
I need a healthy replacement behaviour so I don‚Äôt go searching for  booze 
I quit this time because I‚Äôm sick of hangovers, I‚Äôm tired of losing days to being sick. I black out sometimes. I can drink like the best of em, and when I drink it‚Äôs never enough. I want more. But sometimes when I‚Äôm sitting in my own toxic bullshit it‚Äôs hard to remember those things. The alcoholic voice inside wins a lot of the time. Lately it‚Äôs been a hard go past the 1 month mark. I‚Äôm trying but I‚Äôm in such a terrible mood of my own makings. I am fucking miserable to begin with. I just don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing but I‚Äôm trying to stay sober at the end of this day. Just have to make it through this day.

And that's all true. I never black out, I never miss work even if hungover, I don't day drink, I'm a good high functioning alcoholic, but over the pandemic and last 18 months my drinking increased from 3 or 4 drinks, 3 or 4x a week to 6 to 8 drinks 5x a week. I'm a heavy drinker now and I've noted its gradual effects on my health

I've gained 15 lbs, I sleep worse, I'm generally grumpier with my family. My wife started getting me beer themed presents. Okay but I've got it under control. I'm okay. Right? Then about two weeks ago after a night I had 8 or so drinks I woke up woke up with tingling down my arm into my fingertips. After about 6 hours it went away. Maybe I pinched a nerve while I slept. I was pretty drunk when I went to bed so I probably just had a dead arm and didn't move or something. Felt fine the next day. I didn't drink all week though and I had no more tingling. I got to researching this and learned about alcoholic neuropathy. That was concerning but it couldn't be me. I don't drink that much. I'm not really an alcoholic

Thursday I had 4 and was fine. Friday I had 8, woke up with slight tingling throughout my body that faded by evening, so naturally I had 8 more. Sunday I woke up with pins and needles in my fingers and toes and minor tingling sensations throughout my limbs. 

I didn't drink that night. This morning it feels significantly better but minor tingling still there. I'm literally killing the neurons which make up the core of who I am. From everything I read this is a progressive problem and it only gets worse as we continue drinking. I'm young enough that I don't need to lose function in my limbs to a stupid habit. Not even a fun one just one that makes me isolate, suck at my video games and gain weight

I'm done with this poison. I need a better way to relax at night.

It has been about 42 hours since my last drink. I feel okay but I need to make that drink 42 hours ago be the last one ever",28,1

Lately as a planned exercised, I tried some \*very\* moderate drinking, and you know what? To be honest, it worked for a month and I rather enjoyed it for wat it was. Took a lot of notes about what I was feeling/experiencing before, during and after drinking.

*Then*...I had three nights where I went full tilt, didn't have a limit, and as all of you would already know it was a mistake. I knew it too--I wanted to do some field research and that's what I got.

It's not what I wanted, and wasn't the path I wanted to go down again. I came clean with my wife, and she was very supportive and proud that I stopped soon. This was huge (not only her support--but it made me realize \*I\* wanted a better life for myself, too.)

I began to to taper, and truly believe I could have finished the taper (I know some don't have that control and I understand) but the closer I got to the end I became really fearful the WDs would cause a seizure, and I really wanted to avoid that, particularly because I current take a RX that can increase the rate of seizures.

Even thought I was actually in a pretty good place, I decided to go to the ER and get some Avitan . I've been on it about 24 hours and let me tell you it's a walk in the park compared to the past 4 days of tapering town and my first serious withdrawal almost two years ago.

I don't present any of this as medical advice; do what you need to do in your situation. I was humbled to go in to the ER, but in the end, it was incredibly easier than tapering down and withdrawing on my own. I do feel a little sheepish as this means I haven't really ""paid the price"" for my mistakes...but honestly, it confirms to me that due to my past behavior, Alcohol and I (especially in large quantitates) just don't mix. It's like an allergy has formed based on my past abuse, and that's just a fact.

Finally, I haven't felt as bad as I have in the last two years as I have in the last few days. I had tasted the sweet life of sobriety, control, weight loss, clear eyes, happiness, contentment, healthy stress relief, great sleep, being dependable for my wife and kids, and so much more. It's been a painful reminder (for sure), but the clear takeaway for me is that my life truly is better without alcohol.

As a young woman I never drank much at all maybe once or twice a month. Then 6 years ago I had weight loss surgery; it's common for folks after that surgery to have ""transfer addiction"", because you can't overeat and get your food addiction anymore..and a common thing to turn to is alcohol.

That will never happen to me, I thought.

But as time went on, I started drinking more; first it was two glasses of wine on the weekend nights, then it was a couple times a week, then I was drinking every night. But never more than 2 glasses so I thought I was in control.

The last two years have really sucked for me: I'm a runner and I injured my back, wound up with sciatica for 9 months and had 2 back surgeries. Long and short of it: I became dependent on the opioids I was taking for post operative pain (hey, nerve pain? You can suck it), and was put on suboxone for 6 months. I did well, no relapsing, but alcohol was still there...in moderation, or so I thought.

2020 was a terrible year for a lot of people, but for me it was especially shit:

1. Pandemic
2. Two friends passed away unexpectedly
3. My dad was diagnosed with bone cancer in August and he died 6 weeks later

After he died, I returned home and decided to taper off the suboxone...and despite my doctor's supervision and instructions I went through withdrawals that suuuuuucked. I had to go back on a very low dose so I could get through travelling and Dad's funeral.

Once that was done, I managed to very slowly taper off and I was OK.

In June, my family took a trip out to Dad's home state to visit his family and see the sights; this included stopping at his grave. I think all of this hit me harder than I thought it would, plus I was dealing with my mother (narcissistic tendencies with her own alcohol issues). When I got home, the drinking increased.

I tried abstaining on weekdays; that lasted about a week before I went off.

My mind has been in turmoil, bargaining, arguing about ""it can't be that bad"".

Then I decided to try only drinking on weekends again, so my last drink was Saturday night.

Yesterday I felt mostly OK (I'd done a 16 mile run, so I was exhausted anyway); but towards the end of the day I noticed I was feeling flashes of heat all over, like being hot and then cold. I thought I was just a bit dehydrated.

This morning I woke up at 5:30AM and I was craving a drink. At 5:30AM! This had \*never\* happened to me before. I'm like WTF is wrong with me? I work at home, and I was feeling really tired, mild headache, stomach cramps/borderline nausea

I did not drink. I called my psychiatrist and he was awesome. He said it sounds like mild withdrawals, let's try managing it at home. He prescribed 3 days of timed doses of Valium and gave specific directions on how to take them. I am now on that schedule.

TLDR: I don't know if I'll have to give up drinking forever or just for awhile, but I've heard very positive things about this sub and I thought I'd reach out for encouragement :)",15,1

It just never seems to actually click with me when I think it has. I mess up and feel terrible for days, do okay for a few weeks to a month, trick myself into thinking I won‚Äôt go overboard and slowly allow myself to start drinking again. I had been doing ‚Äúokay for the past few weekends going out with friends, definitely drank more than I should have but nothing crazy happened. Which I think actually gives me false confidence that I can drink when I know I can‚Äôt. 
Fast forward to this past Saturday night. I had dinner planned with friends at a nice restaurant and decided before hand I didn‚Äôt want to drink to give my body a restful weekend. Ofcourse at dinner I immediately caved when the table wanted to split a bottle of wine and after that first sip I was in for the night. We ended up going to a few pubs after dinner bar hopping a bit and I knew from there I should have just gone home, but I didn‚Äôt... we ended up going to do some gambling at a casino and of course having some more drinks that I didn‚Äôt need. ( when I get into a drunk enough state I don‚Äôt have an off switch there‚Äôs nothing in my body telling me that I‚Äôve had enough) 
Near the end of the evening I went to the bathroom with a friend and when I got to the sink to wash my hands I noticed my phone was missing. I panicked and started looking in the stalls (there‚Äôs a ton of them in this bathroom) and couldn‚Äôt find it. A lady had just come into the bathroom as I realized I lost my phone and went into a stall. Because I couldn‚Äôt find it I thought maybe it‚Äôs in her stall so I asked through the door if there was a phone in there and she replied with a quick no. I frantically looked in the stalls again with no luck so in a panic when the lady came out of the stall I again asked her if she was sure my phone wasn‚Äôt there since I had just had it and now it‚Äôs missing. (I have had a phone stolen like this before a few years back in a bathroom, I set it down turned around, turned back and it was gone. There was a lady there that I asked if she saw it and she said no and took off. The police later caught up with her and she did have my phone.) this is where my paranoia comes from because it‚Äôs happened to me in the past. So the lady again told me no but in my drunken dumbness I said to her please if you didn‚Äôt take it can you just open your bag so I can see. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have asked that. She was obviously very offended, but opened her bag showed me and then stormed away. I tried to say sorry and explain to her why I had this paranoia from a past incident and wasn‚Äôt trying to single her out but she didn‚Äôt  want to listen which I understand. anyways we ended up finding my phone in one of the stalls, it was just flipped weird so it blended in. I felt so bad so I immediately tried to find this lady so I could give her a real apology. I found her but when I approached she immediately just yelled for security and I couldn‚Äôt say a word. I spoke to security and explained all that had happened and how sorry I was towards her. They were actually really nice and understood but said because  I had made her uncomfortable that I had to leave. I understood ofcourse as that was never my intention so I left. It‚Äôs hard because I wish she wouldn‚Äôt have given me a chance to say sorry. It‚Äôs eating me alive, that‚Äôs not who I am , that‚Äôs not my character. I should have gone home 6 drinks prior, or stuck to my guns and had dinner and went home. What is wrong with me? I knew people there that night too so I have such bad anxiety wondering if anyone saw what happened. Anyways I‚Äôm just an anxious mess that can‚Äôt eat or sleep and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to move on this time. I hate myself.

Looking for advice from people who stopped drinking in their twenties.,"I'm twenty four going on twenty five and I'm starting to think I should quit the drink. I'm not an alcoholic, it's not like I drink every day, but I am a binge drinker - ball park I would say I drink once or twice a week, but when I do I'm usually completely wasted, like blackout drunk. I just can't seem to drink responsibly or in moderation, I've tried but it always ends up the same. I'm not the most reasonable person with a drink in me at times either, and often end up doing things I wished I hadn't.

I'm sick of the hangovers for a start, sick of waking up feeling like a prick all the time, and I think it's starting to affect my mental health long term because I'm starting to feel increasingly shitty when I don't have a drink in me. I don't particularly like the thought of dying from liver cirrhosis by the time I get to middle age either.

The problem is, well, I love drinking at the time, with a few too many drinks in me I feel top of the world, fucking invincible, and my whole social life revolves around it - it seems that every aspect of social life for a twenty something year old involves a bar or a club. It's even part of my identity, I have a reputation amongst everyone I know, friends, family, even colleagues, for being ""that guy"" at parties, wild, a lot of fun, always takes it too far. I'm nervous about how my friends etc will react if I quit, I don't know what I would do with my free time anymore and the thing is the way my life is just now the drink is the thing I look forward to - it gets me through the week and I'm not sure how I feel about the thought of it being gone.

I'd like to hear from anyone who quit drinking at around my age and what it was like, how people reacted and how it was for you. Is it worth it? Do people treat you like you're lame or boring etc? Just, I don't know, anything anyone has to say I think I might benefit from hearing.",14,0

I went to a job recruitment agency last week and today they got me a job starting at $17 with lots of promotion opportunities! And in an industry I was actually interested in working in, in optometry! As someone who is completely blind without glasses, I am into these job perks lmao. Full time, regular working hours with occasional 8-12 on Saturdays, no big deal. Y'all, I am so excited to finally have a job that doesn't worry my parents like when I was a server.

I never would have even felt capable of taking on a position like this, with lots of technical training, when I was a drunk. I was so afraid to leave waitressing because I felt completely incapable of learning and retaining any other kind of job training. But I'm now the kind of person who made a job recruiter tear up from one of my interview answers (they asked me what my values are, and I could immediately answer with 'authenticity, vulnerability, and integrity,' after watching [this TedTalk](https://youtu.be/UUnRKf2CemA) over a dozen times, I highly recommend it if you are also on the job hunt). I am capable of providing a valuable and thriving lifestyle for myself, as long as I have the confidence and belief in myself, and stay as diligent to being a better person every day as I have these last 420+ days. It took me a long time to feel confident in myself again, it didn't come back immediately. But it did come back, with lots of hard, uncomfortable, but incredibly fulfilling work.

To everyone out there struggling, personally and professionally, I understand how hard it all is and how heavy it weighs. I told someone I was interviewing with on Friday about my struggles with alcohol dependency and how I achieved sobriety, and it was the scariest thing I've ever said in an interview, even though I wasn't super interested in the position. Just today I got the call from them that they also want to hire me. Please never be afraid to be authentic and tell the story of your life. I've found that my sobriety is now my competitive edge. If they don't want to hire you because you were able to do one of the hardest things in the world, that is their loss and indicative of what an uncomfortable work environment that could have potentially been.

Thank you so much for your endless support, SD. I don't think I would be here at all today if it weren't for the unconditional love and understanding I have received here.

I had another cousin stay with me for about six months and we would have wine almost every night.  It was so much fun!  The long talks, lots of laughs, and good company.  A year later we went on a tropical getaway, and again lots of drinking.  One night, I went to order more rum.  She stopped dead in her tracks and with a serious face said ‚Äúyou just drank a ‚Öï by yourself‚Äù.  I shrugged, ordered more and she just stared at me.  

Team Happy Hour at work.  The bartender did his job and said ‚Äúyou have drunk a total of 12oz in all the cocktails you have ordered, I‚Äôm cutting you off‚Äù.  I was mortified.

I‚Äôve had countless group phone conversations with my brother and his wife that started with me sober and ended up with me focusing on not slurring.

Date with a man I had been seeing.  I had already been drinking but it was not obvious.  The 2 glasses of wine I had with him took me over the threshold. I don‚Äôt remember why, but I wanted to stress to him that I was not okay with cheating.  I decided to illustrate that to him by telling him a story that I made up in the moment.  Something about me hacking into my ex‚Äôs laptop, finding out he was cheating, and the subsequent steps I took to get revenge. Never happened.

It was well past my previous record this past Jan of 21 days (I tried to do dry Jan and once I got to 21 days felt I had proved to myself I wasn't an alcoholic and proceeded to become worse. Alcoholic logic lol). 

I was at 38 days and then I had one night of drinking this past Thursday night. It was a perfect storm of a day and I drank. So I rest my counter. Fri was back to day 1. 

But it wasn't like all my other numerous day 1s. It was tough and full of guilt but I immediately started to apply the hard won skills I learned those previous 38 days. Day 2 I was mentally firm in my resolve and not willing to use as an excuse to get in ""a little"" drinking before restarting. 

And I didn't struggle to stay dry this past weekend 

I'm going STRONG. I had my appt with my Addiction Counselor this morning and we talked it through. Before the appt I had already figured out the triggers and had a plan in place for the next perfect storm of a day (doing the work!). I was explaining that I reset my ""days"" but didn't feel like I was at the beginning.  I have learned so much in the last 6 weeks. She mentioned that resetting is a 12 step thing and if I really didn't feel like I was back at the beginning and if it was important to me l should keep those days in my count. 

I earned those days the hard way so I not letting them go! I'm reclaiming them!

So this means I'm at 42 days! I would have been 43 but I drank one night and that's ok because holy shit, I got right back on this dry ride! I am so very proud of myself. This shit is hard.

Then I Relapsed AGAIN,"I relapsed 2 weeks ago and regretted it.  Then I relapsed AGAIN last night, even though I KNEW I would regret it (spoiler: I do regret it).

&#x200B;

I quit drinking in April for the second time.  I had tried two years prior, and managed to stay away for 3ish months before falling off the wagon pretty spectacularly.  I'd been a binge drinker for 16 years, and my problem moments are when I'm alone but want to get out of the house and socialize, so I'd go out and drink with strangers.

&#x200B;

The first time I quit, it was just to show myself I could do it.  This second time, I quit because I'm more aware of how awful alcohol is for my health, and I wanted to start a family with my partner.  I know booze wrecks your reproductive system, and I wanted to be in the peak of health to give babies the best chance. Plus I want to be a sober parent.

My partner and I have separated, but still live together until I can move out in a month, so having kids with him isn't a thing anymore. Now we just tip toe around each other in a 2 bedroom and haven't spoken in a month.

&#x200B;

I've relapsed twice in the last 3 weeks.  Both times it was when I just had to get out of the house to avoid my now ex.  I justified to myself that ""it was just an experiment"" to remind myself that drinking doesn't actually improve the situation, and that regardless of my future as a bio-mom, sobriety is the way to go. I went to a concert alone, had three beers, got a headache after a couple hours and went home early because I felt tired and terrible.  ""Experiment"" determined that alcohol, indeed, did not make life more fun.

So you'd think last night, when I went to the movies alone, I'd pass by the theatre bar and not get a giant glass of wine because I would only feel sick and terrible and it would only lessen my enjoyment (Free Guy is a delightful film, fwiw).  But no, I got that humungous cup of pinot grigio and started my journey towards a headache that is still living rent free behind my eyeballs now 14 hours later. 

Just arrrg.  I know I'm going through a rough time and I forgive myself for trying to take comfort in old habits.  But this old habit isn't providing any comfort, and I really don't need to be making life any harder than it already is. IWNDWYT",2,0

It's time for another club meeting of the SPGSD club. For the uninitiated, several months ago I went for a walk at around 6:30 am with my dogs. This was a thing that Drunk Me would never have done because Drunk Me was too hungover at 6:30 am every morning to consider such a thing. While I was out for my walk, I noticed so many Fellow Sober People doing Sober Things, like walking their dogs, going for runs, driving cars, et cetera. I joked that it was like joining a secret club (the Sober People Getting Shit Done Club) and rushed back to SD to invite you all to join the secret club.

As I'm sure many of you have noticed, alcohol is a major drain on time and motivation. Drunk Me was doing the bare minimum to survive most of the time. Sober Me is still kind of a layabout sometimes, but she still manages to GSD. And tries to post a thread about it a couple of times a month so that we can all crow about the Sober Things we are doing and motivate each other to stay sober and do more Sober Things. 

Rules of membership for the Secret SPGSD club:

1) Do a Thing
2) Be sober while doing it
3) Tell us about it.

My submission: I cleaned the hell out of my bedroom and bathroom yesterday and did about a zillion loads of laundry including folding them and putting them away. Like a Sober Boss. I also cooked a Coq au Vin (with cooking wine from the baking aisle of the grocery store which I don't consider to be real wine and therefore am not tempted to drink it) and it was just marvelous and am I the next Sober Julia Child? I mean, maybe? üòÇ

Okay my Fellow Sober People, tell us all about it. What Sober Things have you been up to?

ETA: Oh my goodness! Thank you all for sharing all of the wonderful and inspiring things that you all have been up to. I'm sorry that I didn't get a chance to reply to everyone, but whether I replied or not, I read every word and you all are GOALS. Truly inspirational, all of you. ‚ù§Ô∏è",933,0

I'm a 37 year old woman and have been drinking since I was 18. I have always been a weekend drinker and I'd say I'm in the group that doesn't seem to know moderation. 

Over the last few years I've come to recognise that I think I have a problem with alcohol. 

I've tried quitting many times but usually only made it maybe three or four weeks before starting again. My most recent sober stint lasted seven-ish months with the help of lockdown (I guess one good thing that came out of this pandemic). I felt so proud of myself. I was healthier, my skin looked great, I was enjoying life (even crazy early mornings with my toddler) but as soon as pubs opened again, I was straight back on it. Going out at least twice a week and coming home trashed. The familiar feeling of guilt when I would roll on hours later than I said I would. Feeling that awful feeling when my alarm went off at 6:30am the next morning and I'd have to get up with my toddler. Desperately counting down the hours until his nap time so I could squeeze in an extra couple of hours sleeping on the sofa. Hours that I should be enjoying to the fullest (the grow up so fast!) instead of just trying to get through them.  Looking at my face in the morning, puffy cheeks, red eyes and grey eyebags. No more I'd tell myself but I'd always do it again the next week. 

I really want this one to be the one that sticks. I don't have high hopes. If there's one thing I'm great at, it's buckling to peer pressure and every single person I know drinks (most quite heavily) and tries to encourage drinking. When I've tried to stop before my biggest problem wasn't the drink, it was other people! I've decided if I want this one to be the one, I have to be honest with them and tell them I'm not drinking. Instead of just making excuse after excuse.

I‚Äôll go for a walk to clear my head and find myself sobbing and hyperventilating. I feel not only my own  pain caused by alcohol abuse, but the pain of my family members who suffer because they took that first sip and never stopped. I feel it from this eternally deep part in the area between my stomach and my chest. It‚Äôs that area that I know is my center, where the universe exists and all that matters starts and stops there. Its that part of me where I find the truth and the truth is I feel a ton of pain and sadness simultaneously. It‚Äôs a sense of loss and sorrow and utter defeat.

When I go through these emotional bursts, I feel so exhausted afterward. These are the moments that make it clear to me I am actually fighting a battle. That analogy is true. There are times when I‚Äôm walking through life doing fine, but the moment alcohol and all it‚Äôs issues enters my mind, the battle begins. Over and over again. It‚Äôs tortuous. 

By drinking, I continue to carry the pain of my bloodline, which ends up becoming my own pain. When we talk about alcohol use disorder, we are not just talking about a basic habit that has gone awry. We are talking about a very complex existence where there is a story in the middle that reveals everything and nothing about us. Every time you see me take a sip of alcohol, I‚Äôm not having fun, I‚Äôm expressing years of self harm. Every time you see me taking a sip of alcohol, you are not seeing me, you are seeing that ancient version of me that took that first sip generations ago and is trying so hard to stay alive. 

The good thing: I don‚Äôt have to be defined by the same old story of how alcohol use disorder slipped into my life. We don‚Äôt even have to rewrite our stories, all we have to do is add a happy ending. I still wish I was one of those people who never took that first sip, but I did. I might even read my own story one day, happy ending and all, and think ‚Äúyou know, this is actually pretty interesting. I like this person.‚Äù",30,0

It's amazing how quickly it sneaks up on you. A sip of a friend's beer, a tiny poor at a family event until it's a lot more than that and the hangover comes to wreck you. I miss the social aspect of it most of all and it still sometimes feels weird sipping on sparkling water. 

But rather than feeling bad that I messed up my streak, a couple of bad days don't negate all the days and weeks I was sober. I don't feel bad about it.

The first month was about hard recovery, but with each passing day I got better and started to find joy in life again. I got back into things I had felt I had no time for when really, my energy was spent on drinking, working to afford drinking on top of my other habits and responsibilities and trying to appear fine.

Fast forward to today and I have been paying off debt, have a better relationship with my partner, making new friendships and connections. We haven't had to buy produce at the store for over a month now since I have dedicated a lot of time to a garden. I have been working on a business plan and will be leaving my job as a restaurant manager in another 1.5 years (worth the wait).

Well for the last year and a half I have been drinking a 15 pack per day and about three weeks ago I decided I was tired (again)  of being sick and tired so I stopped that cold turkey. No problems at all except two or three days of bad sleep and really bad dreams, other than that no problems at all going cold turkey. For me drinking had become a really, really, really bad habit.

I feel better, I like the fact that my face / skin is looking better and my brain fog is gone, thats good cause I started a new job on my first day of no drinking.

I like the new sober me better, not sure (and I don't blame her) that my wife trusts me yet cause of the years of drinking, but I was fully functional with no problems with the law or job all the years of drinking.

With luck that‚Äôs two less moments of temptation in my future.

&#x200B;

Then I slipped into my protective equipment that I bought together with my new MTB - protective equipment which would need to be 1-2 sizes larger, had I not stopped drinking. Not to mention the fact that I wouldn't be wide awake and fresh 9am on a sunday morning, but hungover.

I went on a nice ride on a perfect morning, clear and sunny weather but not too hot.

&#x200B;

Then I returned home and cleaned up, finishing just in time for my sister and nieces to arrive. Together we prepared food, the boyfriend of one of my nieces took over the grill, we ate and had a Nerf-Gun-War after. I also showed my collection of plants (my nieces BF is a Gardener in training).

&#x200B;

Not once did I have a drink. I admit I wished for a moment that I had an alcohol-free beer to mix with some lemonade, a summer drink I always enjoyed before quitting. But I decided against it; it was a great day the way it was, drinking a beer - even without alcohol - would just reinforce the connection between having good times and having beer.

&#x200B;

But I can have good times without alcohol, or any particular drink. This day proved it. It even proved to me that I can be a nice human being that people enjoy having around, and decently funny (mostly), even sober.

I got so drunk I became unable to control my body and I got psychotic, believing imaginary things were real.","I don't understand how life can be like this. I was at a party, and things were going well. I decided a little bit of drinking wouldn't hurt. 7 hours go by, and I've drunk myself into oblivion. I've danced around in the living room, being annoying as hell, people laughing and filming me. After that, *they* opened a new bottle of my favorite wine. I got so drunk I could hardly control myself. My body was a wobbly mess. I'm afraid what I've talked to people about, because I remember believing things that weren't real. I couldn't distinguish between my own life and the Netflix series I've been watching. My fear is to destroy my life, ruining everything. It's not that I don't have regard for people, it's that I actually forget who I am. I've made a giant fool of myself and people are probably mad at me for acting like a disturbed child. I've written an apology for the hosts and I'm left on seen. I barely even remember. I've taken some anti-psychotics now, and they sometimes help with the circling thoughts of terror and agony. I just want to fit in, have fun, belong, and I end up doing the opposite.

TW::: the problem with alcohol to me:


I get euphoric. I get perfect. I feel a deep sense of well-being. Nothing can touch me. I feel funny, beautiful, sexy, normal, okay, like I can concur the world. I lose all fear. In my normal life, I'm completely controlled by fear. That's why it's so dangerous. I never want it to stop. I just want to be the most perfect and most normal and most belonging forever. But its a curse. Afterwards, I feel like the worst sack of shit. I just want to die. I threw up, violently, in the room next the the party before leaving. On the way home, I kept having to get down on all fours, puking. I was not ok. I don't remember the last time I even threw up during a party. I feel so terrible. I could barely walk. Why do I get to be like this? Why doesn't the others experience the same? I don't see myself doing anything differently, but I get completely messed up. It's so embarrassing.

I feel the darkness overwhelm me. I feel pain as if someone is stabbing a knife into my heart. It hurts so bad. I'm a terrible person. I was too much, I was dumb acting like I could dance. I tried to be sexy and ended up like a disgusting vulgar piece of trash, I hope I didn't burn any real bridges. I hope I didn't say a thing that has destroyed something real. I hope the others were drunk too.. I hate it, I'm dying, I cannot handle this. What do you guys do? How can I feel better? I love the warm, lovely sunshine Sunday mornings. They are much better than the wasted days. I'm gonna try again. But right now, I have to survive.",50,0

While crossing a square I met a woman walking together with a boy, about ten years old I'd say. The woman was well dressed and gave a neat appearance overall. She was perhaps not beautiful, but not bad looking. She wore no mask, and when I saw her face I immediately felt something was wrong. I was shocked with myself when I realized that what I was thinking was that ""she is an alcoholic.""

I might have been completely wrong, and this may just be the way she looks, or perhaps she has some other skin condition or reaction. But soon I was asking myself whether strangers, friends and colleagues think the same way when they see me. ""There goes an alcoholic.""

I know I drink too much. I've been working from home during the pandemic, and I drink daily. Not enough to have hangovers, and I stop in time not to wake up sweaty at 3 am. I might have a beer when I'm done working, and I'll open a bottle of wine when I start preparing dinner. My partner will have a glass or two during dinner, and I quickly finish what's left of the bottle. I might grab a beer or two later. Sometimes we open a second bottle of wine, but seldom finish it the same day. On weekends, we drink wine with lunch as well, and there are always good reasons to celebrate something with champagne.

I don't think I can stop drinking altogether, but I am sure I have to stop drinking the way I do now. It is now Monday, and I last drank on Tuesday. So, today and tomorrow and it is a week! I've been feeling depressed and I had splitting headaches the first two days. I haven't been able to sleep, but last night was not that bad, so I am now quite hopeful.

I'm not addicted/have a issue with alcohol - i can easily go for weeks without a drop, but i do enjoy a beer or two on a big social occasion/meal etc. But in the last 6 months we've had an incredible amount of social occasions (mainly due to the catching up over the lockdown), including weddings, big event birthdays etc etc.

I've kept it fairly sensible throughout all these occasions, so nothing actually to worry/feel guilty about. But somehow the hangover still gives me shocking anxiety/worry. Its only happened in my late 20s and its seriously taking the fun out of drinking for me.

Bar culture sober sucks in my opinion. Sitting a table late at night without an alcoholic drink is tiring and I often feel isolated because of it. but dancing is energizing!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I am rarely ever content. I always want more. Not things, generally there¬¥s way too much things in the world, but there is this driving force within me that seems to never quit, that¬¥s part FOMO (fear of missing out), part feeling of never being good enough, part general anxiety, and I suppose just a generous dash of unresolved issues, difficult emotions and all things discontent.

I spent a decade trying to drink this away. Spoiler alert; it didn¬¥t work. It eased my nerves, but only temporarily.

On this sub, I got the first helpful tools to handle those nerves. I knew enough about anxiety, mindfulness and whatnot, but I couldn¬¥t apply it. It didn¬¥t connect with me until I began to explore those inner workings that I had neglected. Alcohol had seeped in through all the cracks and numbed the nerves; now I had to work my way through to repair, rebuild, relearn. I still do.

But, today it actually makes sense to *inhale grace, exhale gratitude*. It makes sense to make a single cup of coffee by hand, just for me. It makes sense to let things go. It makes sense to say, ""I will not drink with you today"", and rather [go exploring](https://imgur.com/a/KOEBqOK). The world is full of magnificent little miracles that I can only see and appreciate with sober eyes. Who knew.

I'll just say that alcohol started as a way to deal with various griefs. Over the course of a few years it became the answer to more, and more questions. My entire peer group are heavy drinkers as well.

I lost my dog about a year ago. I spent a month basically trying to kill myself with whiskey. It hit me that I wasn't honoring the memory of my best friend. I found a breeder that had puppies. Put down a deposit. Stopped drinking.

What I want people to know is that it took more than a month for me to stop having massive anxiety attacks, and almost two months to start sleeping properly again. It's a difficult process.

At a year, I can say that the benefits of giving up alcohol have been significant. I don't believe alcohol is poison, or that it has some insidious grip on me. I may have a drink again one day if I ever actually want one, but I've enjoyed the benefits of sobriety far more than I've ever enjoyed a drunk.

I want to open a new chapter, hell, a new book and start living. I‚Äôm 22 and graduate with my bachelors in 4 months. I have so much ahead of me If I will just choose to enjoy it.

This was an absolute ramble but I felt I have taken so much in only a few hours of reading through all these posts and needed to say something.

I am starting today! I will wake up every day and choose not to drink. 

I had a talk with my husband, I asked what I can do to make this lifestyle change easier for both of us. (Although I greatly explained I am not asking him to stop drinking. However, I do not enjoy being sober while he is drunk and will not pretend I do.)

If anyone has any advice for stopping drinking in a marriage where your SO isn‚Äôt, please give me some words. I feel guilty although He has not made me feel this way. 

Also if I said anything the wrong way, please tell me so I can do better. :)",4,0

I remember asking my boss a question about a project once, she tilted her head and looked at me as if to say ‚Äúthere is something wrong with you‚Äù. That happened a lot.  I would forget full conversations and ask questions that had already been answered.  Or I would tell stories that I would forget, had already been  told.  

I was working full time, going to school full time, dealing with some heavy family stuff while spending most of my nights at home drinking alone.  I was no longer myself, and had become socially awkward.  Drinking anxiety took over and I felt myself becoming off balanced and I no longer trusted my own judgement.  People picked up on that and marginalized me because I became this nervous, indecisive, sloppy, shaky, creature.  They sense something is wrong even if they are unable to identify what.

I‚Äôm performing below expectations at work making tons of mistakes, I have isolated myself from people so my only friend is alcohol.  My shattered self esteem starts telling me that nobody is going to love me in this condition because I had nothing to offer. The alcohol is plunging me into an even deeper depression that I can‚Äôt crawl out of.  I start having suicidal thoughts that I fight off because deep inside my rational mind is telling me that it is the alcohol.  

So what happens at that juncture? I knew I had become pathetic and water finds its own level right, and that‚Äôs how we alcoholics get stuck.  I lost a decade.",19,0

It's because any one of us can only do a little that what each of does matters. It adds up.

Let's say, as is often the case, someone posts here in a crisis. They have many people pushing them towards drinking IRL, even though those people may not even intend to do that. It's a critical co-worker, a frustrating person on television, a bad neighbor, a friend who eggs them on. They may have relatively few people and things right now pulling them to sobriety. Any one of our voices is not enough to overcome this, any more than a water bottle on a house fire. 

But all of us together can make a difference. Not just all of us here but the things we link people to, the resources we share that help us. Any programs that exist in their area. Any positive forces in their life. Together, all of it can pull people the right direction when they are in limbo and ambivalence.

The humility of realizing that any one comment is small here is the realization that we are all small in a way in our own sobriety. We cannot do it alone. We need interests and hobbies. We need people, both in sobriety oriented settings and just good influences in general. And the most important decision any of us can make is to get together all the ingredients for the recipe - yes, at the end of the day it is IWNDWYT - but part of making that concrete is to recognize our needs as human beings and get as much help as is possible to fulfill them without alcohol or other substances.",25,0

It‚Äôs got a STRONG smell. 

Finally found something I like (vodka) and have been on and off for the past 15 years. My longest break was about 2 months but that was 8ish years ago. I am now perpetually drunk 24/7 and my only break is when I‚Äôm sleeping. (I used to keep a bottle next to my bed so I didn‚Äôt wake up with the shakes). I don‚Äôt do that anymore but it‚Äôs gotten worse the last few years while I‚Äôm awake. Like it‚Äôs the first thing I do when I wake up. Sometimes even before I take my morning piss. 

Has anyone ever seen trailer park boys? Yeah, I‚Äôm Mr. Lehey. 

I drink the best tasting cheap stuff I can find, about $12 a handle, keep the whole thing in the freezer and drink straight from the bottle all day long. I buy cases at a time to make sure I never run out, it‚Äôs a horrible feeling being low. I drink about a liter a day (I buy handles and they last me almost 2 days). 

I can physically feel my brain deteriorating. Idk how to explain it, but I can‚Äôt remember names, I stutter now, I use random-ass words to describe everyday items and goings-ons because I literally can‚Äôt think of the words I‚Äôm looking for. 

I have 3 kids (oldest is turning 7 next month) and I‚Äôm sick of living this way. Even drinking so much I cannot even pass out at night I feel so anxiety ridden and guilty. I don‚Äôt want to die before my kids grow up. I don‚Äôt want them to see this as my normal. I love them, I love them so much. I‚Äôm failing them.

*""Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going""*

My morning habit was taking a swig of gin at 8AM before work and then sneakily throughout the day to maintain some level of perceived normality to those on the outside while I was literally killing myself.

My morning habit now consists of:  
\- 5.30am - Wake Up + 10 Minute Morning Meditation  
\- 6:00am - **Write down on a diary** specific goals and tasks of the day   
\- 6:30 - 7:30 - Stretch Routine and Exercise Routine (All Free on YouTube)   
\- 7:30 - Shower + Get Ready for Work

Make sure you have a highlighter handy, and then by 8AM, you've achieved 4 or 5 mini goals and you're on a role. Highlight those tasks as done, and you have visibility on your progress even on the most minute wins. It's a great way of keeping yourself accountable to goals you've set out yourself, and most importantly you're structuring your day.

One of the greatest challenges to sobriety is boredom, and I've found this as a great way to structure your day to avoid boredom and keep improving yourself.

The only thing I remember different about this time from the hundreds of others is that I noticed after a week of not drinking that I felt great compared.

With football season coming up, I know everyone will be getting together for games and drinking and I‚Äôm getting a little sad about not being able to do the same. I also have a gay bff in Florida and our favorite past time has been drinking wine, smoking cigarettes and gossiping. 

I guess I‚Äôm just sad about the little things like that. I‚Äôm not even really upset over the big things like weddings, events and such because those always ended up the worst nights for me. I‚Äôm just needing advice on how to feel better about it all.

I haven‚Äôt even told my two best friends that I am done drinking yet because I don‚Äôt even know what to say. Nobody knows the extent of how rocky my marriage got.

Also, beginning in summer 2020, I began substituting weed for alcohol.

Since then, I have drank 5 or 6 times, and it started out pretty tame but quickly started ramping back up into overindulging on beer and wine like I used to.  Its fun when I am doing it, but i'm a lightweight now and trying to drink like I used to, which is a disaster.

I had my car scratched letting a friend drive my car on the way home one night leaving a parking garage.  He suggested i was too drunk to drive, so I let him.   And he turned out to be more buzzed.  And then this last weekend went on a date with someone i had been waiting years to go on a date with only to end it at a bar.  Which he didnt mind, but I really wanted to get to know him sober and present my best self.  So fail there.  


So these are all just little reminders of why I quit.  I may have to start again, but I want to go back to not drinking.  Life was easier and I didnt have all these issues.   I had a couple of slip ups, but I dont think thats bad in the big picture.  My default is still not to drink, which is good.  


My main issue is breaking up with my drinking identity.  Im sad that I cant anymore.  And I know I feel better when I dont.  But Im still really sad that I am in the boat that cant and trying to accept that.  So back to work on all this, and if anyone has any advice on what to do after a lapse and not feel guilty im all ears.",7,1

I've been using a budget app for over 2 years, and I just checked out my [spending graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/p4yqgs/i_quit_drinking_this_month/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). The drop in spending already is incredible! Even though I'm good about managing my money nowadays, it still caught me off guard.

It made me realize that it's not just the cost of the alcohol itself. It's also how much impulse food I would drunkenly order off of Doordash, often just so I wouldn't be sick. I actually have the motivation to use and cook all the food in my pantry and fridge, meaning my grocery bills are lower and I'm wasting less food as well.

Everything is connected, and drinking throws a big wrench into the gears, causing issues in all areas of life. Looking at my spending graph now, I see freedom.",13,0

Sometimes with some success but never for very long. Looking back now, I can honestly say that over the 30 + years of my chronic alcoholism, there isn't much I haven't tried to get free from it.

That being said, in my early 50's I went through kind of a personality change. It's quite a normal thing at that point to gain a much broader perspective on life and in the process, let go of petty stuff that never really mattered. It isn't unusual to let go of your competitive edge when you realize that your own opinion is the only one that matters. Also when it becomes obvious that the only person you need to do better than, is the old you that you might be trying to change for some reason or another.  Life just begins to look different from many angles but mainly from a position of knowing that you have paid your dues and have earned your place in the world. 

In any case, this exponential broadening of horizons happened to me, gradually over a period of about three years between the ages of 49 and 52. My competitive edge may have disintegrated but so did all my weird compulsions and obsessions. Unhealthy coping mechanisms and anything habitual faded in my personality until they didn't exist. And then....so did my habit of drinking, I was astounded.

I'd spent decades in a love/hate relationship with booze. The highs were higher than I could ever be sober and lows had been lower than anything I could ever put into words. And then one day, without even trying, I was out. Liberated if you will. Somehow I'd survived all those years of alcoholic abuse and for the first time since the 80's, I noticed how blue the sky really is.

I guess the take away on this if there is one is that not much in the grand scheme of life is anything so bad or so important that you should legitimately be concerned about it enough to drink. I know that sounds wild but it's actually true.",15,0

So I am 22 yo but I'd say that I never had alcohol problems. I recently started drinking 1-2 beers every few days and never ever I felt really alive and solid the day after vs when I do not drink at all. 2 days ago I had met up with friends and drank 3 beers and perhaps 6oz of vodka. Today is the 2nd day and I'm simply not feeing myself, anxiety levels are elevated and I feel simply groggy/tired nearly always. Terrible performance at the gym last two days two.

Around a year ago I had decided to stop completely because I drank a lot and felt very anxious for many days to come (3-5 days). I am normally not anxious at all. Not to mention the tiredness which I had.

Why cannot I ever get used to it? Or is it simply that bad and will always stay like this? I mean I have friends and they don't report effects the next days even after heaving drinking, while I am self aware and feel the effects the day after even just after 1 beer.

Drinking alcohol is on par with voluntarily torturing me.

Over the course of the past 11 months, I've let those relationships go. Others I thought would always be there have let me go.

I have been successful at removing toxic substances and relationships from my life, but I do not yet have much to replace them with. I have a therapist and a meditation teacher, but I have very few other connections and for someone who was once very social, this is crushing.

I thought of myself as the type of person who could make friends anywhere they went, who everyone liked. But I guess I'm not like that, or that people no longer want me around.

Spent some time in the hospital not being able to eat or even drink for almost 2 weeks, went off to a treatment center in the middle of nowhere where people with similar problems told me about theirs and listened to mine and knew ways to help me. When I got out I was terrified. I had to live a life without booze? Seemed impossible to me. I went the route of AA, went to meetings almost everyday for a year. Never found a god but learned how to listen and used advice that I was given to figure myself out. I couldn't live with myself sober so that's why I drank. My mind was not a fun place to hang out in before I started working on myself. I haven't been to a meeting now in a few years now but will listen to the occasional meeting via podcast as a reminder of how I used to be.


Now I have a life, a wife, a couple cats, and a different attitude. From what I've learned I can only change myself and my actions. As much as everyone else in the world can suck sometimes there is nothing I can do about it. Also most people don't care about you and probably won't remember you so why hold onto stupid things from the past? Do I slip into my old ways of thinking sometimes? Yes but I know how to get out of them now. 

Being sober is the best life I could have ever imagined for myself and there are tons of ways to get there if you want it. Do it for yourself, it's amazing. Ask for help, it's out there.

Realizing I need an actual vacation.,"I'm 26 and burnt out as hell. I haven't ""stopped"" since college. I drunk texted a buddy last night about all the things going on in my head and what not. He was super patient but basically explained to me that I need a vacation. 

All of college I worked 2+ jobs, one being full time. I liked to stay busy. I also sprinkled in internships where possible. Wasn't really to pay for anything, I just liked my job and friends at best buy, and the night shift at the airport had a promising promotion going for it once I got out of college. 

After that I got hired by a sales company. Performed at either number 1 or number 2 on every single motion I was put on. Never took a day off, cause that would harm my numbers. I would take work home with me in a very literal sense, in that I would get calls from clients wayyyy after hours (sometimes as late as 2am), would have to write any solutions I sold to them, and then update the records upon getting in the office again. 

This is really when life strated to slow down, I started drinking heavily, and eventually just have up on the job. I remember that feeling relieving in a way. Really didn't like what I was doing, I just liked being good at it. Couple weeks into me literally doing nothing but clocking in and out, they gave me the call and let me go. I was drunk while on the call I got fired on. 

2 weeks I was unemployed. Got a call from the tech company across the street from the sales company I had worked at. They said someone within the company recommended me, still don't know who, and that they wanted to interview me. I accepted, got the job, and had a mountain of stuff to learn. 

I had a lot of catching up to do. Most of these guys had already worked in this field to get this job. I'm just good with computers, but mostly my computer. So there's was a lot of fake it till you make it in my first month or so with this company. 

And that takes us here. Realization time. My life is just a story of where Ive worked, how long I worked there, and how well I performed. I don't remember the last time I've just had me time. Probably early high school? Maybe that's normal, but I'm guessing it's not. And if it is, I don't think it should be. 

Anyways, making today the day I give everything another go. Well see how that goes. I got no plans at the moment but staying in bed, but I know idle hands will get me no where. Going to have to figure out something to do on this gloomy, rainy Sunday.",4,0

The first one was a free day time party at a little spot, some chill music from some local DJ's we're friends with. This party was kind of fun, enjoyed seeing people I hadn't seen since the pandemic started, was ***way*** too hot outside so sticking to water was the easiest decision of all time. We left there after about 3 hours as we had a friends birthday party to go to. This is where the realization hit.

When we got there it was the normal type of adult social function I'd grown accustomed to. People all hanging out, sharing some beers and light mixed drinks, smoking cigs & weed, nothing out of the ordinary. I was still comfortable because it was early so nobody was really hammered or starting to lack function. Then the shots started and the harder liquor came out. After about 3-4 hours, people had drank enough, and they started mixing in other drugs. Coke, ketamine, someone had a nitrous tank and balloons. The first one I was used to seeing, its pretty common honestly and when people do it moderately in a night, you really don't notice they're on it. Unfortunately, nobody was doing anything moderately. Within the final half hour I was there, you went from being able to have conversations with people to everybody being incoherent and out of it. The combination of the drinking becoming more excessive mixed with the other drugs made me feel really uncomfortable. It gave me a realization that ***this*** was what I used to consider ""normal"" or ""acceptable"" to be around. This time, seeing it through the eyes of someone with complete mental clarity, I couldn't be around it. I was watching the baseball game they had on TV, and as soon as it ended, found my best friend, told him I was going home, thanked and said good bye to the person who's birthday it was, and drove home. 

My friend texted me and asked if I was okay and I honestly told him that I felt uncomfortable and that seeing everybody do the things they were doing made me uncomfortable to stay there, and that I had a great time for most of it but once things escalated I didn't want surrounded by people in that state. He said he didn't understand(he was reasonably drunk, he had been drinking since our first stop of the day, but just drinking and smoking fortunately), and I told him no worries and to make sure he got home safe and enjoy the rest of his night.

I'm assuming there are other people here who have experienced similar where they try and keep their normal socializations they had before they stopped drinking, only to realize its extremely difficult. I'm not sure if I want to ask how did you manage it or how do you manage to establish new ones when it feels like all of your old ones revolved around drinking/partying?

At least at the end of the night, I was able to drive myself home safe and sound because I did not, and will continue to not, drink.

It started off calmly enough. Some craft brews on the weekend, a mixed drink out at dinner. I was in control, or at least my addiction told me I was. I'm sure many of you can fill in the rest... those innocent drinks turned into drinking every day. Drives to the liquor store just before close out of desperation. Hiding nips at the bottom of the garbage. Buying a 12 pack for the weekend and downing it in hours.

Someone stole ALL the clothes I brought with me. Everything but what I'm currently wearing. I gave a bag full of my dirty laundry to staff on Thursday and someone managed to steal it after cleaning. I'm furious, it feels like an incredible blow to my dignity to be honest. 

I was really down yesterday but it made me realize that for 20 years I've been drinking my problems instead of dealing with them. So I have this incredible backlog of stuff I never emotionally dealt with and now that I'm sober all that stuff is still there...

So that was a bit of an epiphany for me, being sober is not just about withdrawal, cravings and whatnot. It's about finally dealing with everything I've been repressing for almost 20 years, and the  stuff I tried to forget from my childhood. And oh man it feels like a lot to carry around. But luckily I have support, and luckily I have you guys, and thank God I've managed to stay sober and can think clearly.

I'm in a homeless shelter.
No money, turns out meds are expensive. 
Emotional rollercoaster .
Rampant theft.
Shared a room with a still using junkie my first couple days.
My roommate snores Loudly and talks too much.
I broke my favorite headphones. 

The good:
I've got a roof, a bed and meals.
I'm finally starting to understand and deal with my emotions.
I'm getting a bit of clothes today from my cousin.
The speed/meth guy was finally kicked out after 2 horrible sleepless nights, and now I know who to avoid here since I saw everyone he was dealing to in the shelter.
I said no multiple times when he offered me some, which made me feel stronger.
My current roommate is friendly at least and likes me.
No more hangovers!
I'm doing better.

And I owe it to not just my wife but also my best childhood friend for basically saving my life","So I'd been a regular drinker pretty much since I was in my 20's. Just about every day I had a drink in my hand when I would get home from work. I could maybe go a work week (Monday-Friday) without having a drink. But to go any longer would result in me getting agitated and desperate. When I was 26, that's when I started seeing the woman who would one day become my wife. We actually were from the same neighborhood and went to school together but I had a different girlfriend at the time. We met on Tinder and things just kind of went from there. We clicked almost immediately and had a great thing going.

But even she could keep quiet on my drinking for so long before she stepped up and said something. Of course I blew her off over and over, as an alcoholic would. But my drinking would actually become even worse when my mom passed away when I was 29. It got so bad that me and her took some time apart from each other, which just sent me down a hole even further. And one night, I got a call from one of my closest friends who invited me over to his place for his own birthday party. I for some reason thought it was a good idea to walk there since he only lived about five minutes from my house but I was already plastered. It was about midnight, so I already missed his party, and I knocked on his front door before collapsing and falling asleep outside. His kid was the one who found me like that.

Yep. That was my lowest point probably. He apparently dragged me inside and got me on the couch where I slept for the night. If you've ever seen the ""A Star Is Born"" movie with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, he essentially was like Dave Chappelles' character in every way and our talk the following morning was like their scene together. When I got up, we sat outside and he said ""I don't know whether I should feel bad for you for where you at or punch you for making my kid see you like that. Or both"".

He really laid into me about how ""You've got a beautiful thing going and look what you're doing to it"" and ""I always hoped you were gonna make something of yourself and love that you have"", among other things. Then, about five minutes later, my then girlfriend shows up and she looks at me with anger like I'd never seen before (my friend's wife called her when I got up btw) and my friend goes back inside saying ""I'll leave y'all to it"". Literally before I can say anything, she slaps me on the side of my head and berates me before I break down crying a little bit. And all I can think to say is ""I miss her so much"", referencing my mom. Well she gives me an ultimatum and says if I don't stop drinking, she'll leave. Simple as that.

Well, here I am today. My friend would end up being my best man at my wedding and me and her are now proud parents. Adoptive parents, that is. To two beautiful girls. I do still think about drinking sometimes, but that thought goes away quickly. I remember when I first got to the point where I wasn't addicted anymore how well rested I felt and how amazing sleeping was. Now I get to wake up next to her every morning and hear our kids' voices as well. It's been worth every second.",252,0

He's #2 at his company and must likely to own it soon. I've been out of work for almost 18 months.

I quit drinking last spring/summer for good and thank ya'll here for your support. I do get a beer when I visit and we go out but it's mostly for appearance. He drinks from wake to bed unless at work. I have been using uppers cause I like doing stuff and it beats depression which keeps me grounded on the couch. Last night I told him I wanted to see a doctor because I think there's got to be a legal medical way for me to ""fill the gaps"" of drugs. He was genuinely surprised and happpy to hear which made me believe he was hiding his feelings on smtg related. I told him if he has thoughts or opinions about my life and is afraid to say anything because you don't want my feelings hurt, I say a real friend especially speaks up on things that concern him about his friend and fuck his feelings, dead people don't feel. So, he meekly said he'd like to see if I'd try to quit my addictions cause he'd hire me in a heartbeat if I could. I'd be allowed to move into his home and I'd have work, home and a friend! (Currently living on the fam biz course where we have 4 homes and one was empty so I was asked to move back and take it over. But everyone hates me so I'm alone and miserable and I've tried since November to do right but no one cares)

So, it seems like a no brainer, yeah, quit all the shit forever no problem (I do get med marijuana for my back-if I could keep this for emergencies I think I'd be great) get this job and move in.

The fear is his amount of drinking. The fear of slowly going back... I think since I know my triggers now I can identify and seek help before it's too late but this is me covering my doubts...

I wish I could go back to yesterday and slap the can out of my hand.  I had woken up feeling amazing, knowing the weather was supposed to be perfect, I went for a great run.  Spent most of the day out with the kiddo just enjoying life.  Came home and did a bit of weight training, a few chores, and felt pretty darn proud of myself.

What could top off a good day like that?  Why, a beer while making dinner of course!

I don't remember how many I had or when I got to bed.  I type this now feeling like shit, praying the ramen/egg breakfast helps me salvage at least some of my Sunday.  Bonus, anyone who has gotten hammered after a workout can tell you that nothing recovers.

Weather is perfect again, but I don't even have a fraction of the motivation that existed yesterday and everything hurts.  It's this stark contrast that infuriates me.  Today could have been as good as yesterday, the only tiny difference is that I drank.

I suppose if we‚Äôre going to make it personal, I reckon it‚Äôs the difference between ‚Äúsomeone who has a drink‚Äù and a ‚Äúdrinker,‚Äù and over the years (and especially over this past year) I went from the former to the latter. 

‚ÄúNot drinking‚Äù has resulted revising my evening routines. A LOT of warm tea- I like the ritual and appreciate the comfort. A LOT of sparkling waters as well- I think the bubbles keep it from being a passive experience.  I still fall asleep on the couch once in a while, but waking up on it is far less disorienting.

I‚Äôve lost a few pounds. Maybe it‚Äôs the lack of the empty calories, maybe it‚Äôs the lack of drunken fridge-raiding. Maybe it‚Äôs drinking all that water.

Ultimately, I feel like it‚Äôs kept me present and afforded me more options. I‚Äôm very interested in what more sobriety has to reveal. 

TL;DR: This is the longest I have intentionally gone without drinking and it has been rewarding.",21,0

I'm 42M, and I've drank just about every day since I was 21.  Right now, it feels like a 21 year ramp up to undeniable alcoholism.  I've been a ""4 or 5 gin & tonics in the evening"" drinker for easily a decade, with beers during the day here and there.  I've been (in my own mind) the picture of a ""functioning alcoholic"" for so long that alcohol is practically interwoven into reputation with friends and family, but I always felt like I just barely kept on the ""safe"" side of that line.  I had, if not *normalized* the couple of times I pissed the bed or had my wife wake me up in a stupor pissing on the carpet, at least written them off as uncharacteristic flights too close to the sun.

That changed in the last year.  I started drinking more, and found my ability to NOT drink a battle I was losing earlier and earlier each day.  And then I found myself lying to my wife about when I drank and how much.  I knew the spectre of necessary sobriety was lurking, but I was in denial about it.

6 months ago I tried to ""see how long I could go"" just to give myself plausible deniability, and made it 6 weeks without drinking.  I see now that it gave me a false sense of accomplishment, because I was engaged in an endurance contest with no stakes.  Every day I got a ""win"" by not drinking, but I knew that I was going to reward myself at the end of it by drinking again, just ""more responsibly"".  Predictably, all it succeeded in doing was giving me a pass to resume drinking more heavily, because ""I did 6 weeks once, I can do it again.""

I now find myself with a wife of 15 years that is supportive, loving and my best friend who is DONE with worrying about me all the time.  We talked through a plan for me to not drink for a year, because I couldn't deal with the thought of forever- to eliminate the ""see how far I can go"" and instead set a benchmark for how far I **will** go.  21 days in, and I'm realizing that not only do I believe that I can make it a year, I'm beginning to understand that ""forever"" might not be so scary.

My therapist told me that nothing bad ever happened from NOT drinking.  I feel hopeful for the future.

I'm very happy to have found this group.  Thank you.

There were tons of other benefits - more productive days, socially I was present, less anxious, working out more etc. There was a lot of consistency in terms of actions toward all the other facets of my life.

Anyway on Friday evening, right after a very difficult conversation with someone I'm seeing, I was an emotional rollercoaster. I have a history of mental illness - been diagnosed with mild depression and also show signs of being bi-polar. My brother and work-mates were having a little get together and there were some lovely women as well. In the end I figured why not one drink to lighten/loosen up. It ended in me having several drinks and hooking up with a stranger. I spent the next day in bed, not able to do anything and I was regretting my decisions from the night before. Especially hooking up with someone else. Although me and the girl I'm seeing aren't exclusive. 

Anyway, its Sunday, I'm at work and not beating up myself about my poor decision making. I am more committed to my new lifestyle of not drinking. Those 27 days off sobriety were amazing! I was able to achieve in one month, things I was unable to do over 2-3 months.Taking it one day at a time!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Sunday, fellow sobernauts!

When I was struggling to stay sober for more than two weeks I found tremendous support in reading and commenting. I did good, but then I slipped, and was too ashamed to post and comment. That was a mistake.

There's a rule about not posting while drinking, but the only rule against posting while struggling, or feeling like a mess and a failure, is in my own mind.

My self-imposed exile made me miss out on the finest community I know, the only people that understood me. I was pretty close to leaving, like, for real, but realized that commenting and cheering on my fellow SD‚Äôers gave me strenght too.

Some of us wander off, delete accounts, go off the grid when we fall. But isn‚Äôt that when we need the community the most?

I love it when I see people with a reset badge cheer on their fellow fighters. We stumble and fall, but we don‚Äôt give up, and if we see someone struggling, we try to help.

To me, leaving SD would mean to accept that I am hopeless. But that‚Äôs not true! I‚Äôm not, and neither are you! Fall a hundred times, get up a hundred and one.

A couple of weeks ago, my best friend admitted to me that he was frightened because he was rapidly losing vision.  He said he had drank and used drugs in the dark and it wasn't fun.  I attributed it to what I assume is a near universal fear of blindness.

With the help of a mutual friend who he cannot refuse, I convinced him to see a doctor, ASAP.  He found out he has bleeding ulcers on one of his retinas and that the condition usually affects both eyes.  He is even more terrified, now, but refuses to stop abusing alcohol and meth.  I totally get that: quitting meth has been much harder for me than quitting drinking.  The doctor isn't aware of my friend's substance abuse problems but did mention alcohol and caffeine as frequent causes of his condition.

Last night, he asked what I would do if he left me a substantial sum of money.  I asked him if he was planning on killing himself and he said he wasnt.  Later, he asked which of his swords I wanted him to leave me.

I asked him, again, if he was considering suicide.  He denied it.  I asked him if he was planning on killing himself when he began losing his vision in his other eye and he yelled about how that could be years or decades away and changed the subject.

I told my brother all this this and he's going to my buddy's parents and telling them everything, tomorrow.  I know it's the right thing but...

A couple years ago, my friend's girlfriend dumped him and, just to hurt him more, pretended to be friends with me and then to be romantically interested in me.  She had me wrapped around her finger and had me doing and saying terrible things to my friend.  We didn't speak for over six months, until the woman was well out of the picture.  

I credit my friend's loyalty with the survival of our friendship.  He accepted my apology and it's like it never happened.  Our friendship is even stronger for what we went through with her but...

I'm really worried that he will see this as a betrayal and our friendship will suffer.  Even though my brother is the one going to his parents, he's going to know I was the source of the information.

I used to drink a lot like three days a week, and I would often visit or get visited by friends and we would binge drink a lot. 

We decided that it was time to get healthier habits, so it's been great doing this journey with somebody, but I noticed that I'm kind of craving some things to compensate the alcohol that I don't consume anymore, like sweet drinks and some candies here and there.

People at work have been doing this crabs in a bucket thing where I can tell they‚Äôre acting out because they feel some weird way about me trying to improve my life. Friends don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm not around and ghost. I basically don‚Äôt have time to date for a few months. I‚Äôm having to stay out a lot because my home situation sucks.

I was tired tonight and I almost went to a pool hall where a lot of bikers and tough guys go. I used to go there years ago when I was feeling down, like I could just absorb the street cred those guys had and be accepted by them. And I thought that would just make everyone think I was the baddest. Instead, I‚Äôd usually get wasted alone and a couple times, almost got in a bar fight. Then, I‚Äôd wander down the littered, run down street outside, past the bums and feel sorry for myself.

I got a haircut and drove by, half curious if I‚Äôd see anything that would pull me in, the kind of stuff I thought was cool when I was 25, like a dude with a full face tattoo. I was undecided if I‚Äôd drink or try to be a ‚Äúcool‚Äù sober person.

Nothing. All there were were aging, unhealthy people in their 50s and 60s looking pitiful going into the bar.

I sat there a moment thinking about what to do. I remembered there was an Indian market down the street I‚Äôd always been curious about.  I‚Äôd dabbled in making Indian food for a while because I was interested in Yoga and Indian philosophy for a while. Recently, I‚Äôd been re-reading the Yoga Sutras, some books on Sikhism and the Bhagavad Gita after a relapse to try to get re-centered in my life.

I went in and saw it wasn‚Äôt just a market but also had a restaurant with a full buffet with Covid precautions (not self-serve.) Everyone there was Indian - I stood 6‚Äô2‚Äù, 225 lbs towering over everyone in a faux gang style attire (wife beater, high socks, etc.) And I sat down and ate to my hearts delight all kinds of Indian food I‚Äôd always wanted to try!

The cashier was a Sikh and the restaurant was filled with information on Sikh local events. I was a little embarrassed to ask but I‚Äôd always wanted to visit a Sikh Gurdwara but hadn‚Äôt been able to reach one because the local one‚Äôs website was down. I told him I‚Äôd studied some Sikh literature as a child but was embarrassed to say I‚Äôd never spoken to a Sikh in real life. He gave me all kinds of information and was really nice.

The store in the front had not just Indian food but religious and yogic items. I took this as a sign, too. A Yoga guru I‚Äôd wanted to study with but was too far away with Covid had told me a set of items I should consider getting for my practice. There was talk we could probably meet up with the re-opening in about a month. All the items were there and for literally 10% of their cost online.

I left into the night elated. I sat in my car chanting a round of a mantra on my new mala beads, as the still suffering victims of addiction wandered the boulevard outside. I drove past  a storefront local AA groups started renting a few months ago a couple lights away. I could see the meetings going there in one of the windows and reflected on how though I‚Äôm very much a literal agnostic in many ways, I felt so protected from the bad influences and the close calls of life tonight. Tonight, I will keep working towards my future, meditate and I feel safe I won‚Äôt feel any urge to drink. Something else is here with me, whether you want to call it a Higher Power, Grace or just the goodness of people around you pulling you in to good influences.",16,2

He didn't seem too concerned even though I included a decent-sized list of worsening symptoms that have made it hard to work. He ordered a blood panel to check my liver levels and everything else, and told me to eat right and exercise, keep not drinking yada yada yada. This isn't the first time I've been in because I feel like something is really going on and gotten brushed off. I live in the US, if I'm going to the Dr and it's not just a med follow up I'm there because I really think I need help.

The results came in online early Thursday morning. It's Saturday and doctor still hasn't looked at my blood test results, so my friend in the medical field offered to look at them. 

My liver is better than it was but it's still high. Not critically high, I can reverse it. My white blood cells and platelets are high because they are fighting damage in my body.

And guess what? Last time I got a blood panel (in May) the doctor said ""your liver levels are a little high but nothing too bad they will go down"". Well, going through the results what they should have said was ""you have mild alcoholic hepatitis so let's get you a nutritionist so you can be guided back to a healthy liver"", but of course diseases are only profitable when they aren't prevented. 

Luckily this friend is a clinical nutritionist and is helping me for free since we go way back (like kindergarten back). We are having a video call soon and making a plan. 

Btw she can't OFFICIALLY diagnose people, but she knows what she is talking about. When the doctor finally calls I'm going to try to press the subject.

I'm glad i figured out a reason behind feeling like shit. And I am B E Y O N D grateful that I quit when I did and didn't go past the point of no return of alcoholic hepatitis, but now I get to deal with all of these gross, flu-like symptoms until I get better and it's going to take a lot of work to get there. 

And all this in addition to the nuerological issues I dealt with in the beginning of my sobriety.

I really regret all of the damage I did to myself. And why did I do it? There is no good reason. There is NO good reason to drink poison. Please take care of yourselves, guys. You are precious.

I finally realized that, deep within me, lay the power to never feel this way again. I just had to step off the ledge into the unknown and put the bottle down. 

Tonight, as I sip an Non-alcoholic beer by the campfire and reflect on 5 months without an actual drink, I am so thankful that I took that leap. My life revolved around drinking for so so long that I wasn't sure what I'd do without it. 

The answer has been literally everything!! I have done so much that I otherwise wouldn't have. I'm living my best, most fulfilling life and the thought of trading it in for booze doesn't seem remotely worth it.

I‚Äôve commented on different posts and on the daily check up, but I figured I should write my first post to celebrate two weeks.

I‚Äôm rounding third base into 30 years of life and I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs finally time I manage my drinking. I have new priorities in life, including a professional career, the best dog a man could ask for, and an incredible and supportive SO. In all aspects of life, I need to be at my best. Alcohol just doesn‚Äôt fit that equation.

I‚Äôve tried to find sobriety a few times since 25, when my drinking hit its peak. I was drinking 6, 12, sometimes 18 beers a night, or an entire fifth of bourbon, or more. I was in graduate school, away from my family, fresh off a breakup, and my father had recently passed. I used alcohol as an excuse to self isolate and tune out of my surroundings. I missed out on friendships, experiences, and self growth.

At my lowest, I had a panic attack in public. I knew it was time for a change. I moved back home, saw a doctor, and started therapy.  What were my blood results? I was too afraid to look. At an early session, my therapist asked me if I had any ‚Äúbad habits‚Äù that might be affecting my disposition. I answered squarely: ‚Äúno.‚Äù In my mind, alcohol wasn‚Äôt the problem‚Äîit was my self defeating need for perfection and the lingering emotions associated with the passing of my father. 

I eventually had the all too familiar ‚Äúincident‚Äù that forced me to consider the impact of my drinking. As I‚Äôm sure many will relate, it involved embarrassing myself in front of friends and strangers while shit faced (‚Äúbut I‚Äôm drinking mezcal, and that‚Äôs classy. I can‚Äôt have a problem!‚Äù). 

I had my first 30 day stint of sobriety as a much needed break. With 30 days under my belt, I figured: ‚Äúproblem solved!‚Äù 

Old habits quickly redevelop, I learned. For three years I‚Äôve had long spells of regulating (even giving up 98 days of sobriety for a drink with a fling I was only half interested in), eventually crescendoing into days, weeks, or months of heavy drinking.  Ive managed to scrape by in law school, in relationships, and in life, but things always seem to be at a precipice. 


With major life changes on the horizon, I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs time to leave alcohol behind for good. Thank you to this community for your kind words of encouragement, even if they‚Äôre not directed at me. I‚Äôll do my best to be as supportive and kind.

I'm already out on bail for an assault charge that happened when I was blackout drunk. Now I've got a court date that i I plan on and this could complicate my other pending trial. I was doing good for months. Been dieting and hitting the gym 6 days a week. Honestly I've always fucking hated drinking but it's the socially acceptable way of unwinding in my country. I can't smoke weed anymore because they drug test me. I've lost relationships and jobs because of my drinking and I've caused my family and friends so much pain.

2479,2021-08-14 19:54:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p4ixoa/difficult_transition/,Difficult Transition,"Hello Friends,

I (26, M) am writing this from my hotel room on a Saturday night when I feel like I should be out enjoying the nightlife of the city I am in.  For the past 195 days I have been free from Alcohol.  I would be lying if I said that this was an easy change for me, as the better part of the last 10 years revolved around drinking.  Every social event that I attended was accompanied by an excessive focus on drinking.  Bars, parties, brunch, sporting events, family outings, vacations.  You name the event, I was usually drinking.

Drinking eventually became a bigger problem for me and was the cause of much pain in my life.  At the beginning of 2021, I decided that I was going to give not drinking a chance, something that my family members have been insisting for years.  It is not like I cannot cope without drinking, it's just that it has been something I have used to help me ease into social situations (which usually completely backfired as I would drink too much,) and I feel that I am very lost and feel very lonely at the point I am at now. 

I am not writing this to complain, or to find a silver bullet as I know there isn't one.  I have always had a fear of coming across as weak and timid, so even writing this is uncomfortable for me.  I am just writing this to get this off my chest, that I feel like I am missing out on so much and that my life has become completely lame since I quit drinking.  I no longer enjoy going to bars, I view it as a waste of my time.  I find myself avoiding friends and social situations due to me having to explain my non drinking.  I am at a work conference this weekend in a different city and the happy hours and partying are a big part of the conference.  I would usually be the first one at the bar and the last one to leave.  Now, I don't even feel like going at all.  

Maybe this is a normal part of the transition to a life of not drinking and I am overthinking it.  But I do truly worry about my ability to socialize and meet people and hang out with people my age as I am not participating in what should be such a fun time in my life.  Maybe writing this will help me think my way through these feelings, but I am having a hard time.  I worry that the best years of my life are going to pass me by while I sit on the sidelines and wallow in self pity, not drinking has begun to feel like a curse rather than a blessing.  

To whoever is reading this, thank you for taking the time, maybe there are others out there who are feeling the same way.",12,0

It became normal to me to be sober after about a year or so in.

Here‚Äôs what I did:

1) Read This Naked Mind.

2) Got a (good) therapist.

3) Pounded seltzer w a splash of cranberry juice every evening.

4) Started attending Recovery Dharma meetings.

5) Got super into hiking/walking/just moving my body every day.

6) ADDRESSED UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WITH MEDICATION. This one is controversial to some AA people but I think it‚Äôs super dangerous to consider yourself ‚Äúnot sober‚Äù if you‚Äôre on anti-depressants. That istoxic and dangerous thinking. Address your underlying mental health issues. It‚Äôs why most of us started drinking to begin with.

If you‚Äôre thinking about quitting and not ready, please just keep coming back here and reading posts. It‚Äôs how I got started anyway. And if you recently stopped, keep going. Try your very hardest to get through one day at a time. It got better for me and it can for you, too.

Lastly, quitting drinking is a catalyst for change. Let yourself be transformed. Keep evolving. Face yourself, your emotions, your fears. Living a sober life is the way. ‚úåÔ∏è",417,0

It was a splendid time, I got to enjoy Christmas with my girlfriend and her children sober, started looking after my mental health, physical health, anxiety and panic attacks went from being common occurrences to almost non existent. 

I started drinking when I would visit my family cabin to get away from the girlfriend and kids, just for one day when I got there, and I would go every month and a half for a week. Then I started drinking for 2 days while there, then 3. 

Fast forward to today. I had to leave my beautiful girlfriend as I could not handle the stress of her youngest child who has severe ADHD and an ex husband who is in denial of the child‚Äôs illness and promotes negative behaviour. The stress was making me resentful and I had to leave. I knew this would take a huge toll on me as I love her and her kids and I decided to take a leave of absence from work for a couple months to get myself together. 

I maintained sobriety for a portion of the leave time but slowly allowed alcohol to gain a savage foothold into my life. Last night I drank a 15 pack of Pilsner then no idea how many free poured whisky ginger ales. My loneliness and self esteem are at all time lows and my life is becoming a never ending panic attack. 

So here is day 1, where I recognize and accept that there can be no amount of alcohol that is safe for me. The first drink is the most dangerous of them all for people like me and I‚Äôve allowed that innocent first drink to completely pry open my nice little box of health and sanity I had built.

I know I have a lot of trauma and I know I have to work through it. But sometimes it just seems overwhelming. 

I'm still having very vivid dreams most nights... all sorts of bizarre stories my wonderful brain can conjure. The other night I was being chased around an insane asylum by some kind of young jack Nicholson charecter from the shining. (Great movie) not so great when you are the one living it Haha. 

I'm grateful to be sober and life is much better but I see a lot of ""oh God everything is amazing now"" posts. And it makes me wonder if I'm missing something...

Is that actually the truth or are people just ignoring the ever crushing reality of existence? 

I guess I've always felt this way under all the substances. Most likely why I tried to escape in the first place. 

Anyone else get sober only to discover they have underlying mental health issues to deal with? What helped you?

Cut to: A lot of doctor visits and a lot of elevated numbers in my blood work and Liver specialists and a Hematologist and now I'm figuring out what damage is done. 
I'm 46. A bit overweight, but nothing crazy. 
Two months ago, I was putting away 8-20 drinks a night. It varied, but every night. For the last decade...and plenty more before then, just not as much...which doesn't really matter in the scheme of things. 


Over the last three months, I've tapered down on a schedule and I'm actually at an AirBnB right now for the last week of it, for absolute focus, and I had my last beer last night and am going free today. I really didn't want the beer last night, but wanted to stick to my tapering schedule for safety (my GP is aware and has been part of the conversation and planning).

I got my Liver MRI results while I'm here, and they're not good. Not the worst, but not by any means okay. I'll leave it at that. I'm doing and will do everything I am asked to do by my care team. And I'm really happy to be done with Alcohol. 

I hate it. I hate what it's done. What I've let it do. 

I have everything to live for. An incredible wife, so supportive, she's watching our wonderful 5 year old by herself while I detox this last stretch. I have no words for how patient she's been and supportive. Not being able to hold either one when I'm so scared and alone right now is horrible. I love them so much I can't stop crying today at the thought that I may have pushed my health beyond the point of return and leave my son without me. Much less the love of my life.  

Don't get me wrong. I will not give up. I will fight. I haven't been given a mortal sentence, but certainly everything I've read isn't great in terms of outcome. There's a lot of paths to an early end from where I'm at, and only a few to a longer life. I've joined SMART recovery and am starting my first meeting today. 

I love my son. I love my wife. I love my live. So much. 

I am excited to live with no shadow of alcohol between us or over us, and I hope to god and science that I can do it for a long, long, time. 

I've lurked a long time on here, quietly upvoting and drawing strength and courage from posts while I knew I would soon be in this place of being done. I'm posting now, because I'm ready.

I paced through my house for half an hour, randomly cleaning up and organizing as I contemplate the idea that ‚Äújust a six pack‚Äù couldn‚Äôt hurt and would ‚Äúhelp with the loneliness‚Äù.

I called BS on myself.

I‚Äôm proud of myself for not drinking. And although I‚Äôm trying to lose weight and eat healthier, I gave myself a treat of takeout instead. Then a treat of instant ramen (guilty pleasure from back in college).

Well‚Ä¶ waking up on the weekends without a hangover is amazing but today didn‚Äôt do that for me because I honestly felt hungover from all the crap I ate. 

The good news? Food hangovers typically last me half an hour. I already feel normal again. Had it been alcohol, I wouldn‚Äôt actually have a hangover because of the severity of my problem, I‚Äôd have withdrawals that would last for days.

I'm on day 2 today with the librium taper. I barely slept a wink last night, was kind of restless and anxious, and sweat profusely all night.

I just got back from taking my dog on a 1.5 mile hike in the woods which makes me happy since she didn't get much exercise during my bender.

It was 363 days ago. While intaking my daily 4-6 glasses of wine over the evening hours, I got upset by something ridiculous and had another crying jag in front of my family - my fed-up husband, my terrified son. These episodes were rock bottom for me - they were infrequent but inevitable, sometimes explosive. All the despair, fear, isolation, and rage caused by years of heavy drinking would build up inside of me and erupt into crying, yelling, sometimes object throwing. These episodes would fester in our home for weeks afterward. 

And yet it wasn‚Äôt glaringly obvious to me that these crying jags were caused by the alcohol. My brain never called out a possible connection between my constant anxiety and the 1-2 bottles of wine I drank every day. Even the physical affects ‚Äî the poor sleep, dehydration, bloating ‚Äî I never outright told myself ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because of the alcohol. If you stopped drinking that would go away. Problem solved‚Äù

The beginning of the pandemic, I know something had to be done about my drinking because the first drink was getting earlier and earlier now that I was working from home and no longer had to drive my son anywhere. I hid bottles of wine in my home office. I started at 4pm. I worried it could get earlier. I also worried excessively about procuring wine during covid shutdowns because the thought of life without wine made me panicky.

I began to read blogs of women who had quit drinking. It took me months to get used to the idea, to slowly convince myself that this was something I needed to do. I read about the amount of drinking that could cause liver disease and cancer. I knew I was creating irreparable family trauma.

How did my drinking get to the point where I needed to stop forever to save my life? I started out such a casual drinker. I‚Äôd drink a glass to make myself witty and merry, to create a warm feeling with friends and lovers, to immerse myself in a fancy restaurant or wine tasting experience. But it‚Äôs had been years since wine has done that for me. 

If you‚Äôve gotten this far, Internet Stranger, I‚Äôd like to thank everyone on r/stopdrinking who has ever posted, commented, upvoted, or lurked. It was my only ‚Äúsupport‚Äù resource other than a bunch of quit lit and I still check in almost daily. There‚Äôs a lot in my life that I still have to work on, and sometimes I do fall into an emotional dark hole, but the crying jags have disappeared and I am a much better place with my family.

I would get one when they got one, but then I went to the bathroom once or twice, got beers in the way back, the other girl was late and I finished one with my food and went to get another one as I got us all a round for when she arrived, I took a work call, grabbed another one on the way back to the table, over all, I counted - somehow I had 8 beers to their two wines.

I'm only 25, been drinking since I was 15 but heavier/daily consumption has crept in over the last 4-5 years. It may seem ridiculous given my age and the length of time I've been drinking at any serious kind of level, but I feel so done. I've had so many blackouts that haunt my thoughts (""what happened?"" ""did I do something bad?"" ""was something bad done to me?""). Memories from the nights I *do* remember aren't exactly much better. I'm a messy drunk. I struggle with my mental health anyway, so after a few - especially when I'm out - you can guarantee I'll be ugly-crying on the floor, or trying to kiss someone I absolutely shouldn't, or just generally making terrible decisions.

I've had sprained ankles and not remembered how I got them. I've been told I hit my housemate (I don't remember doing it as I was fully blacked out, but that's no excuse whatsoever). I've cracked my head open on the pavement. Not remembered how I got home. Peed in places you ain't meant to pee. Embarrassed myself in front of people I was attracted to, people I worked with, people I wanted to impress, people who might have previously thought I was someone worth spending time with. And that's not to mention all the times I've embarrassed myself in front of complete strangers.

This substance is so toxic. Literally, of course, it's an actual toxin that completely ravages your body from the inside. But also, in terms of how it can destroy everything in your life and leave you with so many regrets, so many ruined relationships, so many gaps in your memory that you're left to fill with the most awful things imaginable.

Over lockdown, like a lot of people, I've been drinking alone at home a lot more. The positive of this being that it reduces the risk of most of the things above, but it's also just so pointless. It's easy for me to say that now, I know, while I'm in this ""I don't want to drink anymore"" mindset. But it really is. Here's my routine:
Get a craving for booze. 
Go to the shop. Spend anywhere from ¬£5 to ¬£20 on booze (for one night). 
Drink the booze, while watching a few episodes of a TV show (that I'll likely need to rewatch anyway, as I'll forget important details). 
Maybe listen to some music.
Feel lonely, miserable, tired... not very ""merry"" at all. 
Binge on some shitty food. 
Pass out to sleep. 
Feel awful the next morning. Oversleep, possibly puke, swallow some pills for the headache/nausea.
Eat some more shitty food. 
Repeat. 

What is the point in any of this? Why the hell is this a daily routine? Even if I still watched TV and listened to music and ate junk every evening and didn't add in anything productive, just removing the alcohol itself would save me so much money, time and calories, and reduce next-day discomfort considerably. 

Recently, I've started feeling nauseous from just a few drinks, and it begins while I'm actually drinking rather than the next day. I feel like it's my body's way of rejecting alcohol, of telling me to stop putting this shit in my body. Whether there's anything more serious going on with my stomach or liver, I don't know. That's probably unlikely due to my age, but alcohol hasn't been my only drug of choice over the years, and I've done some other pretty careless things to my body (long-term restrictive eating, suicide attempts by overdose, etc.)

All I need to do is stop. The more I think about it, the more I realise there are so so many negatives to drinking, and very few positives. It's expensive, ridiculously harmful to your body, leads to blackouts, worsens mental health issues, makes you an insufferable person to be around (generally speaking, at least. I guess ""fun drunks"" do exist, but I'm certainly not one of them), ruins relationships, causes hangovers, nutrient deficiencies, accidents, injuries... I could go on, but I'm in the stopdrinking subreddit after all, so I don't need to. You guys already know what's up. 

It's weird to think that I might go fully sober at 25. I'm confident that it's what I need to do, as I've tried moderation before and it hasn't worked, but as a concept it's pretty weird. I'm a gig-goer, and drinking is so normalised in that scene. In fact, a lot of the social scenes that 25-year-olds tend to be in, involve or revolve around drinking. But weird doesn't have to mean impossible. Weird doesn't even have to mean difficult. I have a work colleague/friend who is a year older than me, used to have a problem with alcohol, and is now several years sober. He seems to be doing great. He can still be around others while they drink, can go to the pub with his husband and get an alcohol-free cider, heck he even goes out to clubs. But he's never the one in the gutter at the end of the night. He'll *never* be the one in that gutter, ever again. And maybe I won't be either.",26,1

I know what I ‚Äúshould‚Äù do but I‚Äôm feeling really confused on what I actually want to do. 
Even worse, a party is being held at my house that night for me by my best friend and where there‚Äôs a party, alcohol will follow.

I got hung up on stepping on the scales until a nutritionist told me to stop focusing on the numbers. Either way, I've toned up a bit in this time. 

I don't miss drinking alcohol or coffee. I visited a friend a couple of weekends ago in Brisbane, Queensland. My friend promised he would not drink while I was visiting as I was an inspiration to him. Then another lockdown was brought in while I was there. My friend immediately purchased wine to sooth himself. I did not lecture or pass comment. He kept his composure while drinking...mostly. The point here is that I was not tempted to join him in drinking at all. I was happy to stick to black and green tea. 

That's all I have to report. I hope that you're all getting on as best you can.

I got sober 33 days ago now. 
The two first weeks were hard but I was extremely motivated (and got the precious support from Reddit!). 

Since the beginning of week 3, I started to think more and more about alcohol. I can feel my motivation decreasing and my cravings taking more headspace everyday. Yesterday was the first time in 33 days I actually considered having a drink. I am having an extremely stressful time and one of the most important deadline of my life coming up at the end of next week (my last school assignment, that will allow me or not to get my Master‚Äôs).
I could hear myself thinking how one drink would help my relax and get through this stressful week.
In the end, I didn‚Äôt drink, mostly because I know I have to stay focused for my assignment and I can‚Äôt afford to be anything else than 200% productive each day if I want to meet the deadline.

But I am extremely worried about what will happen after I completed my assignment. I will be on holiday, with no responsibilities at all and I can already hear the thoughts ‚Äòyou deserve it now‚Äô, ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt matter anymore‚Äô, ‚Äòtake a break‚Äô...

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out **trying** not to drink, we make a conscious decision **not to drink**. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

 **What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

&#x200B;

Good morning SD.  Many thanks for your kindness and patience this week as I took you on a meandering tour of random topics on my mind.  Before I pass the baton on today, I want to talk about the importance of community.

r/StopDrinking is the one place I share my story; it is where I seek guidance and non-judgmental support. As I read through the thousands of pledges and comments in the DCI this week, I was struck by how much common experience we share, this global community of anonymous strangers. Whatever the topic, there were sobernauts sharing their hard-earned wisdom. Others freely offered empathy, practical advice, or boisterous encouragement, whatever was needed. And every single person made the same pledge, strengthening each other‚Äôs resolve: I will not drink with you today.  So, and at risk of being embarrassingly cheesy (believe me, I know that ship‚Äôs long since sailed), I hope the one thing you can take away from this is, even if you have no-one to talk to in the real world: 

**You are not alone.**

To wrap up, I wanted to highlight that if you collated the shared wisdom of the SD community, you would have the greatest self-help book in the world. Don‚Äôt believe me?  Here‚Äôs a tiny fraction of what you wrote in the DCI just this week.

**On self-compassion: -**

‚Ä¢	I look myself in the eyes once in a while and remind myself I love me, flaws, mistakes, good times and the bad ‚Äì u/brown-eyed-wolf

‚Ä¢	You can't hate yourself into a better life ‚Äì u/strength-kindness

‚Ä¢	Sober me thinks about and takes care of future me; drunk me did not ‚Äì u/soberguitar

‚Ä¢	Everyone always came first‚Ä¶Now I know that I need time for me. You can't pour from an empty cup. u/endlessdrop

**On routines and intentions**

‚Ä¢	Self-discipline (not self-esteem) is the key to happiness. u/iwilldrinkurseltzer

‚Ä¢	If you make your bed every morning you will have accomplished the first task of the day. - u/ihiwidid

‚Ä¢	I use guided meditation to fall asleep ... If I fall asleep, great. If I don't, I've just spent time meditating. u/soberingthought

‚Ä¢	Make big tasks smaller‚Ä¶ One piece at a time, five minutes at a time. If I cannot do anything about it at this very instant, I stop worrying about it - u/gswitonper

**On happiness, service and helping others: -**

‚Ä¢	Happiness is not a destination or an end goal. It is a path and a way of traveling that we can choose. u/gravi-tea

‚Ä¢	My sobriety is an act of service to my loved ones but also to myself. u/soberpineapple

‚Ä¢	The instantly gratifying action of using a chemical to change my reality is selfish and the investment return is bullshit. Being mindful, loving and sober is gratifying in a different way. Everyone benefits. ‚Äì u/hairytubes

‚Ä¢	I've never seen a happy person who is only in it for themselves ‚Äì u/countingpossums

**On resilience and resisting temptation: -**

‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs important to draw the line between resilience and ignoring your feelings. It‚Äôs ok to not be resilient sometimes, to have a good cry ‚Äì u/redkd

‚Ä¢	When I practice gratitude, I experience more positive emotions, feel more alive, sleep better, express more compassion and kindness, and even have a stronger immune system ‚Äì u/infinitedreamsawaken

‚Ä¢	Friends can be a great temptation, but only if you let them. Set your intention before you meet them and stay strong. You will enjoy their company even without a drink ‚Äì u/danielbird193

‚Ä¢	This ‚Äúfinal‚Äù attempt at sobriety has to work...Of course if not, I just get back up and try again. u/colekillian

**Welcoming a new sobernaut: -**

‚Ä¢	Guilt. Shame. Remorse. We've been there. Day 1 is hard. Day 2 is hard. For me, it got easier as the days passed, and I came to this sub for support and inspiration. The stories here are amazing. Although some are sad, most are hopeful and positive ‚Äì u/igottaknow

Take a bow, you wonderful, inspirational, smart, compassionate people!

Have a great weekend, and I look forward to being back to making my normal pledges and getting to read the next host‚Äôs posts.  I have no prompt today, please share whatever is on your mind.

My wife and I both work from home but she used to get booked quite frequently to do events before the pandemic.  Things have been slowly coming back, and today she told me that she got booked on an event tonight that goes from 10:30pm till around 1am.  I was already mentally prepared to not drink on my first Friday night, but now I'm gonna be alone with the store right down the street and dozens of stores on my way back from dropping her off.  

I wasn't expecting to be alone and left to my own devices on my first Friday not drinking, but I'm still gonna stay strong, give my self stuff to do, maybe take a bath, do the dumb ""clean the house cause the cleaners are coming tomorrow"" thing.  All I want is to be able to pick her up from work, whereas normally I would drop her off and then she would Lyft home.  Usually she'd come home to me 4-5 cocktails in, having deep cleaned the entire apartment so it was never an issue but I'm sure she'll appreciate being picked up by a sober husband more.  That right there is a core issue I've figured out recently.  My drinking has never been an issue for anyone else, it's never upset anyone or caused any problems with anyone other than myself, so I don't think I saw it as a big issue.  I have fun with my friends, don't do anything embarrassing, and when I'm left alone at night I'll get hammered and go to town cleaning baseboards or re-organize the kitchen cabinets or putting together that thing that's been sitting in it's box.  But tonight I'm realizing the problems I'm causing myself by filling my free time with cocktails, and I can still do all those things and more with some sparkling water and maybe some takeout.

I‚Äôm 48 and have been drinking since I was 14. When life got stressful, I would drink more. When around others that drank heavily, I would keep up with their pace. As a very petite person, this was not a good plan and frequently led to blackouts in my mid twenties. I always figured I didn‚Äôt have a problem because my drinking didn‚Äôt interfere with work, I never hid the amount I drank and whenever I decided to ‚Äútake a break‚Äù I could.

As I got older I noticed I was shaking every morning after drinking the night before. When I would take days off, the shaking went away. If  a friend suggested I ease off the alcohol, I got super defensive and said I DESERVED a way to unwind, wtf was their problem? So what if I drank to blackout occasionally. Nbd. 

28 days ago I was hanging out with a friend. When I‚Äôm with her we drink and drink a lot. We started drinking mid morning and kept going pretty steady all throughout the day. I don‚Äôt remember the late afternoon or evening. I do remember the night. Vomiting, uncontrollable shaking and sheer misery. I had to lie to work and call out saying I had food poisoning. I have no recollection of what I said or did for about a 5 hour span. I let down my work team and I scared the shit out of myself. 

The following day I woke up shaky, nauseous and feeling ashamed. That was my rock bottom. I came home (white knuckling the drive praying I didn‚Äôt puke again) and started searching for literature on sobriety. I found ‚ÄúThe Unexpected Joy of Being Sober‚Äù and started reading. I started looking for resources to help me stop using alcohol to buffer my emotions. In that search, I found this group. 

Thanks to this group‚Äôs wisdom and unflagging support I am now doing things I haven‚Äôt done consistently in years:
- Waking up clear headed
- Remembering everything from the day before
- Running
- Enjoying reading
- Knitting
- Taking care of my health by seeing doctors
My next adventure is to find a recovery group I can attend. I am nervous but excited to connect with other sober people. I have found such inspiration in this group. 

I am grateful every day to wake up, come here and state my intention to not drink. Because I‚Äôm human, I know I‚Äôll fuck up and make mistakes. But for today, I can honestly commit to this intention: IWNDWYT ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",71,0

I can get sober for like 10 20 and even 50 day(my record) but then I go back to it and it's the same bullshit.
How can I find the strength to recognize that I can't drink anymore?

Fitting that it falls on Friday the 13th. Nothing bad happened though. Just another beautiful day with it's ups and downs. 

Somehow, I didn't lose my teaching job while I was drinking. Somehow, I didn't seriously hurt someone or myself (aside from the 3 ER visits last summer because my body couldn't handle the constant funneling of poison into my body). Somehow, I decided I'd had enough after telling myself I was ok with dying at the age of 30. I did it for myself. I'm doing it for myself. And the people directly involved with me are reaping the benefits of my sobriety after convincing myself for years I was worthless. 

I've had the chance to reflect on what it was like the first few weeks and how I could imagine in my head chucking an axe at the dude who kept telling me, ""it gets easier"". And now I find myself wanting to say the same thing to people in their first days/weeks. Because it does. One day at a time. 

Anyway, I had cake and tacos with my family tonight. I snuggled with my two year old and watched Bluey. Gave him a bath and kissed him goodnight. And now I say thank you to this sub. For letting me talk and letting me listen. Without judgement and reminding me I'm not alone even though my default desire is isolation and quiet.

It was over a year ago when I got isolated with my dad because he got COVID and I manifested symptoms myself. Back then I was going through quite a lot. I just got broken up with after 4 years, I was starting Med school, and my mental health was in shambles. But I didn't let the situation drown me further into my drinking habits.

See, although I never got to confirm it with a doctor, my lab tests showed I had fatty liver, and it was only a matter of time before it got worse. This happened to be the result of years of drinking uninhibited. Whenever I would be offered a drink, I'd take it, even if I didn't feel like it. Alcohol was just something that I loved putting in my system. When the dust settled and realized my current situation, I decided to take the opportunity in isolation to stop my drinking habits and gravitate into a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle. 

During this time, I was able to workout more, meditate more, read more, and basically just work more since I was busy with med school. One day when my brother offered me a beer, for the first time since 16, I turned it down. Didn't take me long to realize that I was starting to feel healthier. I was sleeping better, I don't feel tired all the time, I didn't feel like shit.

Eventually I started to notice drastic changes within me. My peripheral edema was subsiding, I was losing weight, my face thinned out. My mental health was improving, along with my emotional health. Needless to say, quitting alcohol was easily one of the best decisions I have ever made.

And my quitting not only improved my relationship with myself, it also improved my relationship with others. A year ago, I had almost nothing, I had no purpose, no will to carry on, and all that. This year I have everything I need. I have a new relationship with an amazing woman who's very supportive, I'm in my second year of medical school, I've grown even closer with my family, and I've managed to inspire a few friends along the way (at least that's what they say). 

Quitting alcohol won't solve all your problems, but it sure as hell will help you take that big leap into a better life. So for those who are still struggling, you'll get there, it will be very difficult, but you'll get there. One day at a time my friend, don't give up.",64,1

During my relapse during covid which I am finally coming out of (I haven't looked at my counter but I think I have about 2 weeks which is the longest I've strung together by far since covid) I told myself that yeah I'm sad and anxious but I was sad and anxious before I fell off the wagon. I told myself that I am a grumpier , more uptight mom when I am sober. I told myself that I was a frigid lover when I was sober. I told myself that there were no benefits to sobriety except making everyone else more comfortable.

And I want to say now, so I can look at it later, that is complete and utter bullshit.

Yes I was sad and anxious before I fell off the wagon, but drinking made me more sad and more anxious and more ashamed and more tired and more paranoid and more everything yucky.

And sober me isn't an uptight mom, I'm a responsible mom. I act my age and allow my children to act theirs. I'm a consistent mom. I'm a predictable mom.

And sober me isn't frigid. Sober me says no when I don't want to and yes when I do want to. Sober me is authentic.

And yes, other people are more comfortable when I am sober, but so am I. Sober me is unashamed and unhidden.

Telling myself the bad things about drinking is easy. Anyone who has gone as far down the path as I have knows that there's only trouble. But believing the good things about sobriety takes effort on my part. And I'm feeling really grateful that after months of trying to climb out of this relapse I am ready to put the effort in.",28,2

When I knew I wanted to stop drinking I told myself I would try no alcohol for 3 months - but only because saying a year or even forever was too scary and impossible sounding, then I stretched it to 6 months but I knew I really wanted to make it to a year. One day at a time I managed 14 months and then I fell off the wagon on a visit to in-laws that I knew would be a real test. I decided to go out for a drink with my husband whilst we were away. Part of my reasoning was that we are the most useless communicators and we haven‚Äôt had a conversation in the last 14 months about anything meaningful and things have been distant between us. We have only ever aired things that needed discussing when we‚Äôve drank alcohol together. The night was fine, nothing awful happened. I did still want to drink lots and fast so that was interesting ... no moderating after a long break there!
I had told myself I would go out for one night and then be straight back to no alcohol. But that‚Äôs not what happened. I had a pint of Guinness one day, a glass of wine the next and then another family event which I drank at in the evening. I was most upset with myself about the last occasion because I had told myself I wasn‚Äôt going to drink that day and I started out not drinking but caved after finding it socially difficult. (Everyone is super shy in the family until they drink!).
I was feeling very down with myself after the last occasion, I woke up at 4am and decided to try a bit of journaling and some self-compassion, not an approach I would have previously taken. I wrote down everything I was proud of. I made it to 400 days. Out of a 12 day really difficult test I managed 8 days (other people around me drank every day). 

I really didn‚Äôt want to reset but those 400 days aren‚Äôt gone, they are still amazing progress, the work I am putting in to learn to be kind to myself hasn‚Äôt gone. Getting drunk made me remember the horrible anxious feeling I get after drinking and how life is much better without that. I now know that I need to put more supports in place for myself next time I visit them (some journaling before, re-reading some stop drinking books, visiting r/stopdrinking more, buying nice non-alcoholic drinks, planning things to do every morning) and some more general things - learning better communication all round!

To get myself ready to reset I just read a few posts here about resetting and someone had suggested viewing it like 400 +1, 400+2, 400+3. So thank you for sharing that idea.

Thought I‚Äôd just share here in case anyone else  might need a reminder to be kind to themselves today.

It's taken me this long to learn that the short term ""reward"" of a drink only lasts for 20 minutes before it goes downhill. That the long-term benefits of good sleep, high energy, and a clear mind are worth gold. That this time isn't going to be different. When I am drinking, hangovers are a problem for Future Me.

I am sure when I do my Steps I will be able to share a bit of it here.  For right now: here is just the last few months that have brought me back into the rooms.

It feels a bit like cheating.  I can see where this is all going, so I am walking back in before my behaviors have repercussions.

Winter of 2020: I get a DUI.  I thought I was way to smart to ever, EVER drive drunk again.  HAHAHA.  Spring of 2020: I go to rehab to deal with anxiety and mental health problems: I wonder if they could possibly come from the drinking that I was still doing?  

Covid pushes my court case back, and back, and back, until the Summer of 2020.  My sentence gets reduced to Reckless Driving.

Here is what has happened since then:

\*I started drinking ""normally"" again immediately after getting the interlock device out of my car.

\*I was still drinking while I had the interlock device.  I just chose to grab hard seltzers from the store, bring them back home at night, and drink them behind my wife's back.  Very healthy for a marriage.  If she ever suspected anything, she didn't say anything.

\*I lost my online ESL job one month before I was due to have my contract renewed in June (worked there five months) because I kept sleeping in past 6 and missing classes.  I managed to not drink the nights prior to classes, but I suspect that drinking on nights I wasn't teaching the next day probably wasn't great for keeping me on a schedule.

\*Starting random fights with my wife so that I could storm off and WALK down the street to buy alcohol.  While I had the interlock device.

\*Drinking the night before when I had to have my interlock device maintained the next day.  I managed to squeak by, the alcohol leaving my system before I had to blow into the device the next day.  But I can't believe I missed the mark by anything more than an hour or so.

\*Drinking during my probation several times.  Technically there is nothing in my probation document that says I can't drink during the probation.  But still, it doesn't show much maturity does it?

Let's jump to the last few weeks:

\*Drinking during breaks at work.

\*Leaving the store during my paid 15 minute break (which we are never supposed to do) to run to the store to get alcohol.

\*Drinking that alcohol IN THE CAR

\*Drinking while driving AGAIN!!!  I've done this more than a handful of times.

\*Getting caught by the Store Manager (the top dog, the boss of my bosses) drinking in the car during a 15 minute break.  I don't know if he chose to be lenient, or whether he didn't have enough evidence to fire me on the spot.  But he didn't.  I still work there.

And my favorite, the one that scared me half to death:

\*Two cops seeing me drink a wine cooler (one of two, but they didn't see the other one) in my car, while parked in the parking lot of the lowes I work at.  They then drove into the parking lot.  Squatted there for some reason.  I have no idea why they didn't arrest me on the spot.  Maybe they wanted me to drive away so they could get me for a higher sentence.  I then got my vest and went back into the store, taking the bottles, ""the evidence"" (I am so cunning), with me to the trash can.  I went back to work.  I then waited for about 15 minutes or so, and could see them from the register I was at, for them to finally decide I worked there and they should leave.

I could have been arrested that day, sent to jail AGAIN, gotten a second DUI, and lost my wife and kid forever.

But I'm not an alcoholic.  Not at all.  I've got this under control.

I'm glad I am back, that I didn't end up getting caught for any of the many stupid things I did.  I will not be leaving AA again.  No amount of personal pride is worth me experimenting with self control.",8,1

I got a good week sober then back to my old shit again. Then my mom died. She was sick for over a year and a half. Completely incapacitated, on a ventilator unable to speak, move, or eat for this amount of time. I was with her almost all day the day she died,  held her hands while they injected her with morphine and Ativan, and eventually pulled the plug and I watched her take her last breath. Watched her turn blue, joints stiffened. I laid with her for a couple hours while she was dead. It was the worst thing in the world. I didn't get to hear her last words. All I saw was her terrified eyes and her holding on to my hands so so so tight. 

So, I began drinking more than ever, if thats even possible. Finally last weekend I had enough. I couldn't even properly grieve or process her death. So I'm 6 days sober and this has been the hardest time I've ever had. Trying to feel all of these emotions and not escape. Everything hurts. I'm exhausted. I think of any memory and break down. 

I try to join Facebook groups but they're all so toxic. Also, is it just me or even hearing sober people talk about how amazing sober life is triggering.. like I'm in the stage right now where I feel like there's no way life will ever be fun again without alcohol. But people are sitting here bragging about their mocktails and having so much fun at a wedding without drinking. It just seems so fake to me. But logically I know they probably are very happy. I think its my alcoholic brain feeding me these lies.

Me, My husband, toddler, and my husband's best friend are going camping tomorrow. I'm happy to get out and have no cell service.  But also dreading it. My husband and his friend drink a shit ton and although.my husband doesn't want me to binge drink, he can't seem to accept I'm an actual alcoholic and thinks I should be perfectly content just watching everyone else drink. Camping is always a time where I have several IPAs by the fire. I'm going to miss that so much. I just literally can't drink anymore. There's no point in drinking 1, 2 , or 3 beers right now.

I have been using alcohol, and sometimes benzos to escape reality for almost 10 years.

I decided enough is enough, since I noticed I no longer could keep a job, especially when your living in a foreign country alone.

I quit the beer and benzos and got myself a grand mal 
seizure. When I woke up, after feeling like i was hit by a train, I just didnt want to drink anymore. I for the first time REALLY feared for my life. I went almost 2 months sober, but falling back to that one beer that led to me blacking out almost a week, and loosing my work computer. Thank the good lord I kept my job. I've been sober for 6 days soon, and am thankfully feeling better than expected. I will not go back to the booze!!!

Please, to those who have relapsed in the past, do you have any tips to strengthen my willpower. It's more stupidity than anything. I managed that long, and started to see the benefits of how it was to be younger. I'm 29, but feel like 50.

Thank you all. I have been reading so many posts in here that have helped me along the way. I'm so grateful for you guys on Reddit. You really make a difference.

My longest dry streak was almost 40 days after not making it past 5 after countless attempts.

My heart is so exhausted from this cycle.

I black out at night, wake up in the morning and try to remember when I went to bed/what I did the last couple hours/how much I drank.

Then I workout, try to do some cardio to help get this poison feeling out of my body.

I eat breakfast to try to get something in my stomach to help absorb whatever shit is in there, listen to an audiobook or podcast & try to get into a better mindset.

I tell myself, I DO NOT WANT THIS. I don't want THIS to be my life.

I am so unhealthy. I have gained 40lbs over the last three years and I know a good half of that is from all of the booze & mixers. My mental health has been a mess. My relationships are suffering. And I am terrified that I can't beat this. I have the most amazing man in my life and I want to have a beautiful life together. My kids see me drink, cry and check out in the evenings and I don't want them to remember me as this. I want to be happy for them. I want them to know that I loved them and I was so thrilled to be their mother. 

Once noon hits, the idea of a drink starts creeping back into my mind.

And the promise that I made myself to get over this, asks ""but why?"" because I still feel like I am looking forward to that drink.

3:00 hits and I am having a shot or two.

4:30 I realize I have already drank too much and slow down til 6.

6-8 I ramp up again & by 8 I'm tired but sometimes I am still up drinking until I make it to bed.

&#x200B;

I haven't barely any entirely sober days this year. 

There have been a few times the past month where I drank, but went to bed sober because when  I reached to drink the first glass--my head said this is not serving me. And so I drank, felt it, and said this is not serving me. Had a glass or two of water, sobered up and went to bed feeling so much better.

The thing is I cannot stop myself consciously after I have drank. I know that. 

I have to stop myself from having the first one and it's so fucking hard.

So recently I posted that my 1 year of no drinking challenge was complete and how excited I was, especially with my newfound mindset around drinking. I set the challenge for myself when COVID drinking was getting out of control and I was using it as an excuse to avoid working on other areas of my life.

Fast forward to tonight and I have plans to meet a couple girlfriends for drinks. I feel very conflicted. I want to go out and fill up my girl time tank with them, yet I also feel anxious after not having had a drink in over a year. When I‚Äôd hangout with them sober I‚Äôd usually leave after 1 mocktail and they were onto their second drinks (because I was tired, didn‚Äôt want to go to the next bar, etc.) so sometimes I felt like my time was cut short. Sure we‚Äôd do sober things, but sometimes I felt FOMO about the nights out.

I‚Äôm a bit of a perfectionist and can be really hard on myself, so I feel like I need to keep the streak of 365+ days going since I‚Äôm here already. My bf thinks I put too much pressure on myself and he‚Äôs not wrong. On the flip side I feel like I‚Äôve developed a new mindset around drinking and I could go out and be very mindful/stay curious about how it‚Äôs effecting me and witness if I‚Äôm actually enjoying myself. Like an experiment I guess. I do think I‚Äôd have the willpower to not go over board and stop at 2-3 max, and if I was staying out later than usual end it with some bubbly sodas and lime. I enjoy a good nights rest too much now lol.

I don‚Äôt know, I guess I‚Äôm overthinking like I always do and my perfectionist pressures are making it hard for me to break the 365+ day streak. Sorry for the rambles. Any insight or any feedback from someone who has been through something similar would be really appreciated!",53,1

I don‚Äôt typically get blackout drunk, or even full-on drunk for that matter. Just as bad, however, I would be perpetually buzzed. I‚Äôd start around 9am with a vodka/water to ‚Äúhelp deal‚Äù with work anxiety. Then another in the late morning and a couple in the afternoon. Then, I‚Äôd switch to wine in the evening. This was almost every day for about 8 years.

10 days in and I‚Äôm sleeping better, getting shit done and feeling far more alert. The 3am anxiety attacks have subsided despite having the same amount of shit to cope with. And not to mention no longer having to hide bottles, worry about booze breath, lying to my spouse, or having to drive to different liquor stores so the staff don‚Äôt see me there two days in a row.

Thank you to this sub, and to the incredible courage of everyone who posts, reads, comments or lurks. We got this!

Never ruined my life, never got violent, didn't get regularly black-out drunk, never hit that fabled ""rock bottom"". But who am I trying to kid?


I've gotten drunk every single week for the past 3 maybe 4 years. I've gone from being a pretty fit good looking guy to an obese mess. For the first time in my life I am heavier than my father. Did I say that I've never been violent? I once pushed my step-mother to the ground because I was drunk and she made me angry. 

I thought I regulated pretty well. Only 6 beers. Yeah, *only* 3 liters - just a measly 1500 calories that costs me unimaginable amounts of money in a month and ruins the days that follow. 

Sure, I don't do anything stupid, I tell myself. Except all the negative angry arguments I seek out online. Spending my last bit of money when the month isn't even a third up. Then there's the time I wandered outside in complete delirium searching for my girlfriend who was in the bathroom. She came out looking for me and we had to break back into our home. 

I made my brother cry when I was rambling drunk. He sobbed for the entire night and I couldn't even remember what it was that I said. 

Yeah... no rock bottom. There is no bottom if you keep digging, you'll continually find new depths and make up justifications for them. 

I went to a school reunion and an old friend was shocked at the state of me. When I looked at the pictures I didn't recognize myself. If I don't allow this to be my rock bottom then I shudder to think what may otherwise come. 

Fuck drinking, fuck this pervasive perverse culture that promotes alcohol everywhere you turn. I'm not buying it anymore. I deserve better. I owe myself better. Getting drunk is not worth feeling miserable, hurting my loved ones, feeling grossed out at my own body, being perpetually poor, feeling physically sick, and worrying about dying prematurely.

My boyfriend of 2 years who has raised my soon-to-be 3-year-old since before she could walk or talk (her bio dad isn't in the picture) - has told me he's over it. I can't get better.

I'll go 2 - 3 weeks without a drink then relapse. He's given me ample warning. I was sneaking alcohol behind his back (i.e. vodkas in water bottles). He caught on and he felt so betrayed, and we almost broke up then and there. But he decided to give me another chance - long story short, it's been months and I haven't improved. I haven't been picking up after myself, picking up my share of the household chores, and worst off have been deferring almost 100% of the parenting to him. He works crazy hours from home (11 pm to 8 am) and I've been very unfair to him.

Yesterday was the last straw - I had ordered vodka behind his back and accidentally put it on his credit card like a dummy. He kept quiet about it for like a week hoping I'd fess up (needless to say, I never did).

He told me yesterday he feels like he is a full-time single dad because whenever I'm drinking or hungover, I'm not doing my part to parent. He feels like he's taking care of TWO babies. He said he loves us both, but he's miserable and just can't do it anymore. He offered to put some money away in a savings or trust for my toddler - he said he still wants to be there and support us. I have temporarily moved my work from home station to my parents' house and the daughter and I have been staying here. He actually insisted we stay in the apartment until the end of the month (lots of tears were shed between the both of us) , but I told him I felt I should give him space and time to think. I've let him know after talking with several family members who all agree I have a major problem that I may check myself into an inpatient program.

I know I screwed up and I know trust is extremely hard to build once it's been tore down. But how do I let him know I'm serious this time? Is it too late? Have I screwed up one too many times? He is the love of my life - he saved me from a toxic situation and really helped build me up and want to do better for myself. The alcohol only happened because I experienced a loss in the family in October 2020 that I haven't been able to recover from. I really don't want to lose this man - when I'm sober, we never fight and he's such a great daddy to my toddler. She was crying the whole way to my parents' house for him, like she knew there was something very wrong.

I am a mess. I can't eat, I can't sleep...I feel like I had a great life. We were a happy little family. And I ruined it by putting alcohol above everything else.",10,0

The husband has been teaching remotely since September of last year. One of the requirements is no delay in service due to power outages, so in order to keep up with his students from all over the world, we bought a generator. We live in the boonies and are on a well and septic system. Up until two days ago, we didn't have an issue with the power. However, prior to this, I begged and pleaded with him to do a test run with the generator after our friend redid our fuse box to accommodate it. ""Nah, we're good, we never lose power!"" 

Cue storms, cue flat line winds, cue no power. 

Cut to trying to find the generator instruction book in the dark garage. 

Cut to trying to put oil in the generator in the dark and spilling it all over the floor. 

Cut to finding out that our friend put the wrong plug end on the cord. 

Cut to me doing my best not to murder him with my gardening equipment as he deals with all this. 

Had I been drinking, I'd most likely would have been in the car securing ice and beer for whatever was coming post storm. Can't let that beer get warm!

Had I been drinking, I'd most likely be hungover and even crabbier that I was yesterday. I said a few things (natch) and there was a verbal tussle, but in the end, we got the power back on with the generator. 

Of course, it's almost 90 degrees, and we can't run the AC, but I am doing okay. Yesterday was a test for sure, but I passed it and didn't drink.

We received a gift from my in-laws, who happen to be my oldest son's godparents. It was a godson plaque and it brought up some painful memories from his baptism visit. Overall, the weekend was a success but I was drunk through the entire thing. I had a bottle of wine to get me through the church service and continued to drink once we got back for a party at the house. I didn't do anything stupid or major but I feel guilty when I think about not being present for a big moment for my son. My in-laws are very difficult people and I struggled with the decision for them to be the godparents but we had little options in the way of catholic people we felt close enough to ask. Unfortunately, my husband's relationship with them has deteriorated since the baptism and we are keeping our distance for now. I have been struggling because I feel incredibly guilty that we are not sharing more of our lives with our sons with them but I'm respecting my husband's boundaries at this time.

There were times when I thought I achieved each and both of them. But why was I so miserable?

My idea of moderation was essentially to drink all that I could get away with.  At what point should I go to bed so I can still make it into work tomorrow?  I got pretty good at it.  This led to me being ""functional"".

Functional - I was never fired, arrested, evicted, not any of the neon signposts.  But as I comment here often - functional was like having a car that is stuck in first gear.  I got there, often late with a lot of drama and people pissed off at me on the way, sometimes smoke coming out from underneath, and with a great deal of wear and tear.

I've been to thousands of AA meetings over the years.  I've heard my story repeated with minor variations too many times to count. And what it all boils down to is, I was not nearly as unique as I wanted to think I was.  All this ""successful"" drinking kept me in a rut of misery until I was 39.  I got out in time, but it was a close call.  5,10, even fifteen years sooner would have made a big difference in my life.  If you have the opportunity of sobriety now - consider taking it.

And here's the thing I'm not complaining - life without alcohol is wonderful.  Life without alcohol allowed me to work on the ""reasons"" I had to drink.  Today I am comfortable in my own skin.  I really can't ask for anything more.

Just wondering if anyone got through it alone in a few days? I'm so scared to go to work tomorrow.

First time posting here on my throwaway account.

I've been starting to think a lot more about my drinking habits as I'm a daily drinker. I usually have two beers a night (440 ml cans / 5%) and this is enough to help me relax and unwind in the evenings. This has been going on for 5 - 6 years and my partner is worried that I may be an alcoholic. I feel like I'm in the denial phase as I never wake up with a hangover, my personality doesn't change whilst drinking and I can always perform my job well the following day. My health is fine and I can't say that I've had any adverse effects from drinking.

I've asked myself the following questions and these are my honest answers:

Do I want to give up drinking? No.

Could you go 30 days without alcohol? I think so, but it would be difficult.

What do I think would happen if I gave up drinking? Trouble sleeping, more irritable.

Do I ever feel a compulsion to drink more? Not really.

Idk folks, at most I'd class myself as a functional alcoholic but I'm not sure if this is my brains way to try and justify my drinking. Personally I don't feel it's a problem as it's not negatively impacting my life but I do feel like I need a beer or two to properly unwind which is a classic sign of dependency.

What do you guys think? Have any of you been in a similar position and what happened? I'm 26 / M is anyone is wondering.",6,0

I was so excited for this job and I had networked like crazy for months in order to just get an interview. I had made it to the last round.

I took the day of the interview off from my existing job so I could just focus on that.  The interview was at 11:30am the next day, so I knew that I would be able to sleep in.  I also knew how much I could drink a night in order to be able to function the next day.  However, because my interview was at 11:30am I would be able to sleep in a little, so I felt safe to drink more than my nightly measure.

The next day, I had an extra hangover but I pushed through.  Got some coffee in me and I felt better.  As I got to the tech campus, I started feeling bad, really bad.

The first interview started and I had mind fog, I heard myself answering questions and not being concise.  I was babbling.  The second and last interview was even worse.  Now I had to puke.  My focus was on not puking.  I remember when I thought it was going to happen.  I put my hand over my mouth kinda nonchalantly like I was actively listening to the interviewer.  I also did a quick scan of the room and I saw a garbage can.  I decided that if I had to puke, that would be the vessel I would use.  In that split second, I also decided that if I did puke, I would explain it away by telling her I was pregnant.  I knew before the interview was over that I was not getting the job.

It gets better.  As I left and was walking back to my car, once again I was concentrating on not throwing up.  Get in my car and I‚Äôm barely holding it together.  I emptied out my purse (fortunately not an expensive one) in order to throw up in it if I had to.

I‚Äôm still at the tech campus, the stop light is red and the ‚Äúwalk‚Äù light activates for tech type pedestrians to cross the street.  I‚Äôm the first car next to the cross walk and people are crossing the street in front of me.  It came quickly, too quickly, I  threw the car door open and projectile vomited.  I closed the door and I stared straight ahead looking through the group of pedestrians that had stopped to look at me.  I acted like they were not there and avoided direct eye contact. 

Went home and slept. Opportunity blown.",17,0

This mental health spiral has triggered some next level drinking and this next level drinking has triggered a mental health spiral. I keep sliding further and further down. I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a mask and barely holding onto any semblance of existence. I‚Äôm really struggling. 

Last night I got extremely drunk at a friends house (ex, of years ago) and was apparently almost fall down drunk. I left, drove on a highway, went to get food at Safeway, drove to a park, went swimming in the water, and drove myself home. And lost my keys in the process. The number of just inexcusable fuck ups in one night is appalling. I wish I could say I made better choices usually, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs right. I spent the better part of today trying to piece together my evening. By the grace of something I found my keys via Facebook and they were in one piece. As am I. As is my car. 

Blackouts are terrifying. The level of functionality I have while blacked out is also scary. I‚Äôll have very coherent conversations. Walk around. I don‚Äôt even know. They‚Äôre more and more common. But so is my drinking. I also think some of my meds contribute. 

I was in this space a few years back. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt sit still and just be so I just keep running from everything and drinking to aid in the escapism. I‚Äôm scared. And yet I fear, like many times before, this holy fuck will fade and I‚Äôll be right back at it. 

I don‚Äôt even want to leave the house tomorrow. I‚Äôm worried about what I might‚Äôve said or done. Or how I might have seemed. It‚Äôs a small place I‚Äôm in and I‚Äôm trashing my reputation.

Remember when you had that convo? You spilled beer there. Those are the crumbs from last night. That‚Äôs the beer car you tossed.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Friday 13th, SD! I‚Äôm nearing the end of my run as the daily check in host, and it has been my absolute pleasure and privilege this week to share with you some of my challenges and some of the resources I‚Äôm using in pursuit of a happier and healthier life.  

Earlier this week I mentioned a book called Think Like a Monk, and in that the author claimed to know the secret of a happy life.  I‚Äôm not going to lie; I was sceptical when he said that it was **‚Äòto live a life of service‚Äô**, but now I‚Äôve thought about it for a while, I‚Äôm not sure if he was onto something. 

Cast your minds back to the early months of the pandemic when many of us hunkered down at home while essential workers put themselves at risk.  We clapped our gratitude for our health workers, but many other professions provided a vital service.  Our streets would have been a stinking, rat-infested nightmare in no time at all without the brave workers who collected our household waste every week. Any work you do that helps other people can be a life of service.

In the first lockdown, store delivery services were overwhelmed, so I did grocery shopping and medicine runs for my parents and my elderly neighbour who were all ‚Äúshielding‚Äù at home. I joined a rapidly established neighbourhood network to offer help to anyone else in need, as did huge numbers of my neighbours ‚Äì it seemed everybody wanted to help if they could. Research has shown that when we help and serve other people, we have better health, and less depression. And it truly helped me in those scary times to focus on the needs of my community, rather than on my own worries. It‚Äôs strange to say but my small way of being of service during a crisis made me happy, it gave me purpose that I guess I was lacking.  We are hard-wired to find life-satisfaction in unselfish actions, and the pandemic brought that into focus.

So, what do you think?  Is helping others the secret of a happy life?  Or have you found a different secret to happiness?

And while we are on the topic of service, what better way to give back to the DCI community than to host the daily check in?  If you have 30 days sober and would like to offer your service, chat to our beloved patron saint of the DCI, u/SaintHomer ‚Äì it will make you happier and healthier, science says so!

I caught up on some shows, and I didn't need booze to enjoy them. 

I don't come from a family of alcoholics, but both my parents did, so they're completely abstinent. Me? I drank in college and just caught the habit from there. I was worried I might turn out like my grandparents and die of jaundice, but this experience has taught me that I just need to be disciplined for like 3 days, because after that, my cravings largely go away. I just need to keep myself busy for 3 days, that's all. 

I'm planning on staying abstinent, minus some *very* light social drinking, for the foreseeable future, cause honestly, without the cravings, it's just a headache that I'm choosing to have. Thanks for all the support, everyone!

I just don‚Äôt really know how to fill the days sometimes. My life is kinda boring. I work from home in a steady but not at all stimulating job, I‚Äôve never been a person with any sort of athletic or artistic passions, and where I live things are still kind of iffy in terms of covid safety for activities/social engagement. So I go to Sephora or H&M or whatever and spend 100$, and that‚Äôs fine and I feel fulfilled for a while, but it‚Äôs not setting myself up for a healthy financial future and I‚Äôm currently in a position I should be saving way more than I am.

Please don't read if it is too triggering to you, if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and it will give you anxiety, or if you are fragile in your sobriety and this might make you want to drink. It's ok to just pass this over, I completely understand.


I have had a long relationship with alcohol, and I never successfully quit for longer than a few months. That is, until I was cleared to start trying to have a baby at 31 (I have health issues that were preventing me). I quit drinking immediately. I knew I never wanted to chance any damage to a baby, even though they say it's ok to ""drink until it's pink"". I'd never been able to quit, but then suddenly it was easy.

I got pregnant within 3 months of trying. With my health condition I was warned it might take longer than normal, but it didn't. Alcohol was not only easy not to drink at that point, it sounded downright disgusting.

As I got further and further along in my pregnancy, I got so determined to continue my sobriety. I knew I wouldn't want to drink while breastfeeding. I knew I wouldn't want to have any hazy memories or be snippy and hungover with my sweet boy. I loved him so much.

But my baby died at 31 weeks plus 4 days. Worst yet, it was completely preventable, entirely due to medical negligence. My baby should be thriving in a NICU right now, but instead I'm recovering from birthing my dead baby.

What I went through was heartbreaking and traumatic. What I go through now is intense grief. I've never felt anything like this, I truly wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

All my plans and dreams revolved around my baby boy and they are all dead. So is my resolve to stay sober.

I type sober today. We are doing an assisted cremation tomorrow morning to cremate my baby boy, and I know I don't want to be hungover for that. But the first thing I want to do afterwards is drink. I want to shut my mind off, I don't want to feel afterwards.

How have you gotten through grief sober? How do you feel motivated to be sober when your dreams are dead? I try to think about honoring my son, but then some days I am just too sad to care or do anything.

Both my mother and father are children of alcoholics. All of my grandparents, on both sides, are as well.  I am too.  As expected, everyone in my family is an alcoholic of some sort.  Either been dry for 20+ years, or currently a functional alcoholic.  There are zero people related to me that drink in moderation.  I'm lucky.  As far as I can tell, I'm the only person in my family in three generations to be born without the alcoholic gene.

But I still used it for the wrong reasons, and that's why I stopped.  I'm currently 24, and generally, I drank because I was lonely, and because I believed that alcohol solved most of the problems I had with myself.  

I have monstrous hangovers.  One night in college, I had 3 beers and spent the entire next day puking my guts out.  I missed class, and I almost failed that class because of it.  When I was 22, I had three drinks the night before thanksgiving.  I didnt make it to thanksgiving the next day.  

Then I graduated college, was unemployed for about 6 months because I was too depressed to look for jobs.  Alcohol made me feel a little better.  Eventually I found a job. It wasn't a particularly great job, but it paid the bills.  I moved somewhere I had never been, knowing nobody.  Then my girlfriend broke up with me, and alcohol made me feel a little better.

And then one day, a year ago, I got angry.  I realized that I was only using alcohol as an escape.  I decided that if I'm going to be lonely, I would not run from it anymore.  I'll just have to go out and make friends the hard way.  So I quit.  I lumped weed in there too, though I was never much of a user in my adult life.  No drugs, except coffee.  It was hard.  I craved it for a while.  I dreamed about it sometimes, and still do.  Waking up feeling guilty over a dream is odd.

And that brings us to today.  I did end up making friends, the hard way.  Without any involvement of alcohol on my part.  I have better relationships with my friends, and better relationships with good people in my family, than I ever have.  I realized I hated my job, and I got a different one.  One I really like, and I'm good at.  I realized I hated myself, so I got a therapist.  And they helped me understand myself, set goals, and achieve them.  I know I'm happy now, and I know that my vision is clear.

Thank you for the support these past couple years.  Just the random people out there, living your lives without alcohol.  That's what kept me going through the parties, through the alcohol fueled family events, through thanksgiving and christmas dinner and easter, my birthday, the 4th of july, vacation and halloween.  Every one of those days, I thought about drinking, and all of them I said no.  I would just check here, and I would know that I was going to make it.

It's really hard to believe. I spent a lot of years hanging out in bars, working in bars, drinking with friends, drinking with strangers, drinking to celebrate, drinking to mourn. This was not an easy lifestyle adjustment for me. It actually helped in some crazy way that I chose to try out sobriety during the ""quarantine years"" 2020 and 2021. I never go anywhere and I haven't been tempted or tested by anyone but myself. Turns out, being sober is pretty cool.

I also made a [personal vlog](https://youtu.be/u6wuQg2ZJcU) of how I spent all my newfound time in the last year since I wasn't drinking. Mostly, it was a lot of self-care, hugging my cats, reading, spending time in nature, and being insanely productive. Lots of hot tea and sparkling water as well.

It's honestly been great. I feel so much more present than I did a year ago. I could tell my stories about all the horrible consequences I had from drinking that spurred the change in my life a year ago, but today I'm focusing on the positive. 367 days sober AF!

How the fuck is somebody supposed to take the necessary steps to be happy for the first time in their life if they don't enjoy being happy? I'm literally just fucked and there's no way around that. That's why suicide/violence toward others becomes an increasingly appealing option over time.

The thoughts always come back and tbh their strong right now

The ones that remind me I'm 26 and a virgin, that my younger sister just got accepted to grad school (and make no mistake I'm proud of her) while I'm struggling to get my degree at 26 and won't have my bachelors till I'm about 29 or 30 if I haven't killed myself by then. The ones that remind me that I'm going to die alone, the one that tells me no matter what I do it doesn't matter and I'll never have the kind of life I want, and the ones that tell me I should drink or kill myself because at then it wouldn't hurt so much all the damn time.

I'm so tired of these thoughts, I'm so tired of struggling everyday with depression, I'm tired of going to bed every night and wishing I wouldn't wake up in the morning knowing that at least didn't happen when i used to drink myself to sleep.

After years of living like this, losing hope that I‚Äôd ever be able to drink or be around alcohol like a normal person, I stumbled upon some information that actually made me feel like there might be a light at the end of the tunnel! I just learned about medical treatments for alcohol cravings, and found a substance abuse clinic that specializes in these kind of therapies at a renowned women‚Äôs hospital near me.

I have been researching this clinic for days, reading up on their work and the experiences of people who have tried these treatments. I worked up the nerve to call today!

Well. The receptionist was so fucking rude to me that now I don‚Äôt want to go. She kept telling me I had to come through their walk-in service because it would be weeks for an appointment - the walk in operates three days a week for two hours in the morning. When I explained I couldn‚Äôt come those days for the next few weeks because of my job she *could not comprehend* this - she kept asking why I couldn‚Äôt come. I am a shift worker and I know my schedule months in advance, but she clearly couldn‚Äôt believe anyone accessing their clinic would have any actual obligations.

The rest of the conversation was so off-putting. She was abrupt and rude, argumentative even. I asked for a virtual appointment if possible, which she didn‚Äôt respond to. She confirmed an appointment for me in a few weeks, and when I asked if that was in person or virtual she snapped ‚Äúyou just told me you wanted a phone appointment‚Äù.

At this point I‚Äôd been on the phone for ten fucking minutes trying to negotiate an appointment, and I just started bawling. I told her that this was such a difficult phone call to make and she was being so rude to me. She softened slightly due to my UNCONTROLLABLE SOBBING, but damn, I don‚Äôt want to go now.

How is this ok for the first point of access to care for this shit? I can only imagine how many vulnerable individuals just hang up. I have a ton of supports and had done days of research, and I still wanted to hang up. Some people shouldn‚Äôt work in healthcare. I really don‚Äôt want to go to this clinic now and am thinking of cancelling and trying another. So bummed to have lost that hopeful feeling because of this interaction. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to my venting. Needed to get this feeling of being a loser off my chest, and not ready to tell my friends about this yet.",250,0

It also intimidates me that this is going to become an every day part of my life from here on out.

I always thought I'd be missing out on fun if I stopped drinking but then realized that the drinking had become anything but fun. I started drinking seriously  in college (about 20 years ago) and was able to keep things relatively I check until some personal challenges a few years ago resulted in me drinking more than I had been comfortable with in the past. When the pandemic hit, I began drinking every night and woke up everyday with a tidal wave of anxiety, depression, and rage looming over me. I didn't connect it to the drinking at the time and convinced myself that I HAD to drink as an escape from all the overwhelming sadness and anger. It wasn't until my wife left and took our 3yo son that I woke up. Actually, it was a month after she left and I had been drinking the most I ever had before when I had an epiphany that I was modeling to my son the same cycle of addiction and anger that has plagued and alienated the men in my family for generations - the same behaviors and emotional responses as I was shown by my own father.   The future of my marriage is still . . . uncertain, but no matter what happens on that front, I'm steady and committed to being a better human and father than what I thought was possible when I was drinking.

I just found out (the hard way) that it can be really dangerous to be on it while going through alcohol withdrawal,"A couple months ago I experienced really bad physical withdrawal symptoms for the first time. It had been about 12 hours since my last drink -- I wasn't even trying to quit, I just woke up in the morning and was out of alcohol! I was running some errands when my eyelid started to twitch uncontrollably and my vision suddenly went blurry. I got this intense rushing feeling that started in my stomach and went upwards. My right hand started to tingle and go numb as well. I made it home and had a drink and everything was fine, but the experience really scared me. After that point, I realized I couldn't go more than a couple hours without a drink, unless I wanted to experience that weird rushing feeling. It was almost like vertigo, and made me scared to walk around because it felt like I might fall over. I was especially worried about having a tonic clonic seizure. I'm pretty sure now that they were partial seizures.

Anyway, this went on for several weeks  before I talked to my psychiatrist about it (I know... I should have brought it up sooner...). He mentioned that I should stop taking my Wellbutrin if I was going through withdrawal, since it could increase the risk of seizures. I did -- and bam, the weird seizure-like symptoms stopped. It made cutting down my alcohol intake a thousand times easier, and also a lot less dangerous.

I just wanted to throw my own experience out there in case someone else finds themselves experiencing something similar. If you're on Wellbutrin and thinking about quitting drinking, talk to your doctor about it!",17,0

It has been 4 days since my last drink. I haven't gone without alcohol for longer than 4 days since January. Because I didn't *want* to. But finally, I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

Sleep has been completely disrupted. Day 1 napped throughout the day, obviously hungover. Had no motivation to do anything other than shower and cook dinner. That evening however I was able to pass out earlier than my usual bedtime.

Wake up the next day 9 hours and 45 minutes later! Way too much sleep! Again, sleep has been completely disrupted. Had more energy however but not over all good. Realizing I must still be hungover (withdrawal). I muster up the energy to get what I needed done around the house like cleaning and laundry, even got some sun in the backyard and did my nails. But finally had to lay down around 3:30 pm exhausted. Took a nap. Why?! I got plenty of sleep! I don't question it, just listen to my body. Big mistake! I toss and turn last night wanting to go to sleep but can't. See the pattern? In my 19 days not drinking my sleep has been incredible. I've always battled insomnia only learning that was a result of my constant drinking. One night of drinking was all it took and here I was suffering the consequences. I finally pass out around 3am but shortly before I had a really bad episode of heart palpations. 3 huge pumps and the anxiety kicked in. My hands started to go numb. Impending doom. I mustered up the courage to not go with it. I convinced myself I was ok.

This morning I wake up about 7 hours later and feel A LOT better. I think I got through the worst of it. Still feel a little anxiety and shakey but overall the physical changes I noticed from that one night of drinking has passed. 

I have these last few days to hold onto the next time I want to drink. I just wanted to share for anyone going through the same. We are all trying to kick this horrible monkey off our back and this is a reminder that it is not worth it! Hearing other stories has helped me tremendously and I hope this helps as a reminder to anyone out there. This absolutely disrupts your body's natural way of being and thinking one night won't do much but this has been proof to me that it absolutely does and further motivates me and proves to me that I need to brake up with alcohol once and for all.

When I woke up today, I realized how this may have been accomplished:

I am partners in a national high ticket sales organization and the CEO does not drink and does not attend AA, but he runs the company using spiritual principals that are also taught in 12 step programs.

Additionally, the company primary mission is to HELP OTHERS and the side effect of that is an exponential return back.

As I said, I just realized that could be the primary reason I have been able to stay sober without going to AA, however, I first noticed during our weekly ""motivation"" meetings with the sales team, the CEO was continuously utilizing phrases and telling stories directly from the literature, and was kind of embarrassed that it would be obvious to many that this was AA speak, but ended up just accepting it and nobody ever mentioned it to me, until today, realizing that this messaging is what people needed to hear including me. Now I am embracing that and ready to share the message more myself.

Examples include: 

1). Take what you like and leave the rest

2). On testimonials, share where you were, what happened and where you are now

3). Encouragement of prayer during difficult times

4). Help others get what they want and you will end up with a life beyond your wildest dreams (the Promises)

So...I also just found this group this morning and totally agree there are many ways folks can find to help them stay sober and grow spiritually, but don't discount the possibility of finding employment or a business opportunity where your fellows are walking together on the road to happy destiny.",13,0

Some goals I've set:

* Workout more
* I planned a fitness-related photoshoot at the end of September
* I hired a nutritionist to help count my macros and drop 5 to 10 lbs of sludge. I'm sure the wine wasn't helping this
* DBT (for mental health issues and substance abuse) weekly

The only thing I'm a bit nervous about is I planned a girls weekend getaway to Miami with a friend I haven't seen in a couple of years. She is very healthy and mentioned we don't have to drink but I kind of wonder if a glass of wine at dinner would be ok? My idea was to stop Antabuse and go on Naltrexone for 10 days..but now I'm thinking if I continue the Antabuse I just won't be able to do that and that would be helpful.

I decided about 10 weeks ago that I would give up drinking just to see how my body would feel without the empty calories found in the craft beers I love so much. At first I didn't really see or feel any tangible results other than the loss of couple pounds, which I fully expected. In hindsight I understand that I set expectations that were entirely unrealistic. I thought I would be able to train harder and more frequently without consequence because my diet was near perfect and the only liquid I was consuming was water or my home made smoothies. Well needless to say my assumption of newfound invincibility led to a pulled hamstring and then to a calf strain more recently. I stayed true during the rehab of the hamstrings, a bachelor party,  and even a a good friends wedding! I was killing it.

 Unfortunately, and fortunately,  the calf injury got to me and this past weekend my streak came to an unceremonious end.  I had two beers, and my first thought was that I could allow myself a small treat once a week in this form. Fast forward to the morning after and my head was a cloudy, my stomach felt like a hot mess and I felt as if I'd been awake for days without sleep despite getting a full 8 hours. I suffered through my worst day at work in weeks I was as useless as tits on a bull. I longed for the day to end. I was a complete and total mess from what used to be a casual nights consumption! 

By now you might be wondering why I said that my streak coming to and end was fortunate. Had I not cracked those two beers that led to that horrible morning of despair I would still be waiting for the tangible results of sobriety that were never going to arrive. The expectations I had set were so high, so unrealistic, and had such a stranglehold on my thoughts that I was blind to all the benefits I should have been enjoying. I look back and understand why my stomach didn't ache constantly, how much my energy levels were much improved, why my thought process had become quick, clear and focused and most importantly that I was getting truly restful sleep. 

TL;DR I gave up drinking as an experiment and didn't understand the benefits I was experiencing because my expectations were too high. A small lapse in my objective painted a picture so clear that now I don't want to drink again.

I (23f) just had a break up of a long term relationship. We were together since 2013. I have no friends and no one to talk to. During the relationship I would drink a lot by myself on the weekends anyway because I felt very lonely, and I‚Äôm just struggling because I don‚Äôt want that to continue. I‚Äôve been wanting it to stop for a very long time. I managed to go two months at the start of the year, but then wedding season hit and it was a downward spiral from there. I did the two month sobriety while being very isolated from everyone, and that may have helped but it was very mentally rough. I‚Äôve been drinking heavily since 18, and by 19 it turned into a 4-5 day a week thing which got even worse last year because of covid. After the two months at the start of the year I‚Äôve gotten it down to 1-2 days a week but even those 1-2 days are a lapse of control because I don‚Äôt want it and always start out the week with the intent not to.

3) I've saved at least $2000. 
4) I've finally been able to forgive myself for some of my drunk fuckery from back in the day. Sobriety is me taking responsibility for my mistakes and making sure they never happen again.
5) while my mental health isn't perfect, I've been able to deal with mental health crisis with a clear head, which I am SO grateful for. I'd much rather be sober and freaking out than DRUNK and freaking out ya know.",991,0

Wanted to share that I ‚Äúsurvived‚Äù my first company work trip in about 18 months and to Vegas no less!

What a great way to roll into my 2-year mark!

At times, being the only one at a table of 10+ who isn‚Äôt drinking can seem tough - in practice, what I‚Äôve noticed is that you‚Äôre thinking about what other people are thinking about you WAY more than they actually are.

There‚Äôs a certain level of confidence and even dare I say ‚Äúswagger‚Äù that comes with ordering a club soda with lime and not being phased by the standard ‚Äúoh shit! You don‚Äôt drink?‚Äù From my coworkers who I met in person for the first time.

What I can tell you is I was the most rested, productive and relaxed participant here.

Thinking back there was so much to give up and in contrast so little to gain by trying to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù.

I like this new life I built, this subreddit community and I wouldn‚Äôt trade any of this to pretend like I had a ‚Äúfun‚Äù night.

I hope that those early on in their journey are able to find the same peace I have recently.

Thanks for reading friends",19,0

**Thankful Thursday is a weekly thread where we share and discuss our gratitude. Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Hey everyone, hope you‚Äôre all doing okay today!
I never thought I‚Äôd say so, but these days I am grateful for my emotions. ALL of them.
I was drawn to alcohol in part because it disconnected me from painful feelings, and unfortunately this disconnect also meant that I closed the door on my ability to truly experience positive emotions. Alcohol felt like the emotional equivalent of listening to white noise on headphones.

When I wasn‚Äôt actively drinking, anxiety and low mood were generally the only two emotions that would escape from the hangover/withdrawal fog during the day. Experiencing such a narrow and negative spectrum of feeling impacted me profoundly because it gave me no sense of direction, or ambition, or hope, or any of the kind of feelings that might allow me to grow and lead a fulfilling life. Numbing and disconnecting through alcohol stopped me from facing and dealing with pain and it prevented me from achieving any kind of growth or peace. I stagnated.

When I quit drinking, the only way I can describe my mind was that it was completely ‚Äònaked‚Äô, just like the name of Annie Grace‚Äôs book. EVERYTHING WAS DIALLED UP TO 11. Without alcohol I felt vulnerable and things were feeling so raw. It was hard to deal with and it remains possibly the most challenging part of recovery. Navigating this new onslaught of emotions felt like sailing through a rough storm in a tiny boat that was always at risk of capsizing. During the first few months I also experienced the opposite situation - anhedonia, where I felt no sadness, joy or interest in anything at all.

I‚Äôve learned over time how to better manage and live with the emotional ups and downs of regular life. Accepting my full emotional spectrum has not only helped me heal but it‚Äôs initiated pretty much all positive changes - it‚Äôs truly been the foundation of my sobriety. These days I feel like I‚Äôm in a decently built yacht sailing on some slightly smoother waters. The negative emotions are helpful signals to me and I‚Äôm learning to sit with those. I know they‚Äôll pass. With the positive feelings, my favourite feeling is peace because it‚Äôs the absence of pain. I‚Äôm always incredibly grateful to feel peace because it‚Äôs an emotion I can access even when life is otherwise unexciting.

*‚ÄòGotta have opposites, light and dark and dark and light, in painting. It‚Äôs like in life. Gotta have a little sadness once in a while so you know when the good times come‚Äô* - Bob Ross

 Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share what you‚Äôre grateful for today - whether that‚Äôs your own reflections on riding emotional waves, or whatever you‚Äôre appreciating right now ‚Äì no matter how big or small. Sometimes it really is just the small things.

Take care! Alex",33,0

Even on days I couldn't keep water down not 8 hours prior. Between one with dinner or a whole bottle of gut rot vodka, I have done unforgivable things. 

But something changed. One day it just started to feel like an obligation. It was work. To sneak around, to find the money for it, to even do minor daily tasks. It was a job. Then I had an amazing date with someone who has been sober 15 months. I was shocked by how uneasy I was. Whether it's a shot before the date or we go out for drinks, there is always that mind altering substance. 

After the date I got the same gnawing feeling to drink. So I did. A lot. I ended up spilling boiling hot water on my chest. Second degree burns and probably permanent scarring. I have hospital bills, broken relationships, and scars all from drinking. It has never served me. I am only on day 3. But I no longer crave it. I pray I can keep this momentum going.",53,0

Now I'm ready to try again.","(Oncoming venting ahead so grab your ""oh shit handle"" lol). 

Hello to the nicest sub on reddit! I'm on day 4 and I am miserable (but starting to feel better). Not just because I can't drink but because people around me that I love are going through horrible stuff and I'm trying to help as much as possible, and not drinking is of course harder when I'm stressed out and worried. I really accepted in these fucked up times of stress that I have the ability to help so much more if I stay sober (especially if I don't have fucking hangovers). And I also have a lot of personal shit to deal with. Sorry I will be swearing, I really need to vent, here is a non-comprehensive list.

My mother in law and little sis in law are sick with Covid for over 10 days. We got vaxxed, they didn't because they trust science and are serious about covid but don't trust the government. They got sick from playing with a neighbors little kid.

My sister and her kids have now been living in a camper I helped them buy in a church parking lot for a whole year. She still hasn't paid me back because she can't do her taxes because her identity got stolen when her wallet fell out of her pocket on the way back from buying booze.

My already disabled mom was just diagnosed with cataracts on top of her partial blindness anyway.

My good friend is going through HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS CALL BATMAN AND A THERAPIST AND THE POLICE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT LEVEL SHIT. Her life is on fire now on top of her 10 year old kid trying to commit suicide because of bullying a couple months ago. So so much there, just damn.

My other good friend's aunt just died so she flew down to Cali yesterday during this delta variant wave for the funeral. I am currently babysitting her sweet disabled dog who was rescued from the meat market in South Korea after she was stepped on as a puppy and her pelvis was shattered (hence her disability).

One of my brother in laws is on the street shooting meth and heroine into his veins.

One of my other brother in laws is destroying his life and health with chronic SEVERE alcoholism. He's so mean to me and it's so sad because I love him.

One of my other other brother in laws has serious mental health issues that he needs to be hospitalized for but refuses treatment.

One of my other good friends is super mad at me for being drunk and calling him out in a rude way when he wouldn't leave my house for 6 fucking days.

My dog is 15, blind, deaf, dementia, arthritis, subluxated patellas, and muscle spasms but damn he still has sooo much energy it's amazing. He got bitten on the butt by a mosquito or something so I have to medicate his butthole because it is swollen and will get infected if I don't. Because of course he's allergic to everything. Love him so much though lol

Speaking of dementia, I reconnected with a few of my older friends since I was vaccinated a couple months ago and it took him several minutes to remember me. We've known each other for 9 years. I literally helped him walk again because of my profession (before covid).

Oh yeah I've been unemployed this whole covid time, a blessing and a curse. 

My dad died when I was young and I have another older man in my life that I consider like a father. He's going through an insane amount of stuff with his kids and also deaths in the family. The stuff with kids involve sexual abuse in their childhood from their bio dad and other hard stuff too.

My kitchen sink and dishwasher started spewing grey water into my garage so that's been fun.

Took in my car for a tune up a couple days ago and will get it back tomorrow with a $700 bill. Oof. 

I haven't smoked cannabis in about 10 days because it's been giving me intrusive thoughts and anxiety about the past, present, and future. Wish I could enjoy it again a couple nights a week like I used to but whatever.

I've gained 10 pounds of beer weight since covid but hey at least my boobs look great lol.

I have a phone consultation with a lawyer tomorrow to see if civil suit statute of limitations are up because I was raped 4 years ago. I told myself I would never be raped as an adult but guess what? I was, and alcohol was involved. I was such a lightweight back then. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckity. Fuck.

I have been an alcoholic for 4 years now, the sexual assault was definitely part of it and if I want to stay sober I NEED to deal with it in some way.

Oh gosh I'm pretty sure I missed a few things but this is turning into a novel. 

Anyway, I'm sitting outside chainsmoking and working on my 4th non-alcoholic beer in 4 hours right now at 11:25pm in 80 degree weather. Jeez. Luckily, we just got a little AC yesterday! Yay! 

My partner of 10 years (anniversary is this month) is going to go on the sober journey with me. I am so thankful. We are both going back to school as adults in September.  I am going to become the scientist I always wanted to be since I was a little girl. I either wanted to be President, an assassin, a contortionist, or a scientist. So I'm going with environmental scientist. Because if we don't turn this world around right quick then we are all fucked forever and being an alcoholic or not won't even matter if we can't make real changes. To help bettermake those changes, I need to be sober.

For me, a little alcohol takes the edge off, a lot of alcohol inflames conflicts and trauma diarrheas out of my heart and mouth. Blegh. I hate the taste.

One is too many, a thousand isn't enough.

Thank you so so much for anyone out there that reads this from the bottom of my big sad loving heart.

I will not drink with you today.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

Good morning, SD.  Ok sobernauts, let‚Äôs take stock of where we are.  After implementing all the great tips we‚Äôve been sharing this week I know you are now leaping out of bed in the morning with a positive mental attitude, and at night, you are sleeping in a sea of merit, basking in the golden glow of knowing you have had a perfect day.  What do you mean, ‚ÄúWhat planet are you on, Neverwhere?‚Äù

Wow, what a bunch of losers, could you be any lazier? Hang on, hang on ‚Äì get your sticky little fingers off the downvote button, I‚Äôm just making a point.  I would never talk to another person like that, but I‚Äôve called myself a loser, a failure, and much nastier things more times than I can recall.  That inner voice nags me and belittles me in a way I‚Äôd never dream of doing to a friend.  I‚Äôm not alone in this.  Cast a casual eye over StopDrinking any day of the week, and you‚Äôll see sobernauts putting themselves down for not matching up to some imaginary ideal. It‚Äôs a testament to this fantastic community that you will usually see other SDers immediate rallying to object to the put-down and instead provide compassionate support.

What was your immediate reaction to my nasty words at the start of the last paragraph? Did you feel angry, hurt, defensive? Perhaps you recoiled from the screen ever so slightly? What would it do to you if you had to deal with nasty little put-downs, day after day, for your whole adult life?  

Yes, I‚Äôm talking today about self-compassion, a topic that crops up a lot in these parts because it‚Äôs such an essential tool in recovery. Since joining SD, I‚Äôve adopted the mantra ‚ÄúBe kind to yourself‚Äù. My personal interpretation of this is:

1.	Treat yourself gently and compassionately, as you would a friend

2.	Regularly check in with yourself. If you feel stressed, exhausted or in pain, then give yourself whatever you need to recuperate.  

3.	It‚Äôs ok to be sad, or angry, or unsure what to do. It‚Äôs ok to not be ok.

4.	Don‚Äôt compare yourself to other people, your journey is your own

5.	The goal is progress not perfection ‚Äì celebrate even the tiniest win 

If this is a topic that speaks to you, you can find lots of useful resources at [self-compassion.org](https://self-compassion.org) including an extensive reading list and a quiz to assess your level of self-compassion (I scored low, but that‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs early days yet ‚Äì see what I did there?).

If you feel like sharing, how do you practice self-compassion?",261,0

last week my partner and i split.  we had been together since i sobered up.  a couple months after i cleaned my life up we met and had been together ever since.  i will spare everyone the details and sum it up by saying i miss her a lot.  i probably shouldnt, but i do.  i dont have anyone to talk to with about it, which is also hard.  but even if i did, they wouldnt get it.  i have a clear conscience because i know the whole truth about the way things were between us, but that doesnt actually make it hurt any less.  i lost my best friend, im sure most if not all of you can relate.  it just hurts man, for a lot of reasons it just hurts.  i constantly want to reach out, but i will keep resisting.  
  
so there it is.  my entire little support system, gone.  poof.  when it rains it pours eh.  death, grief, sadness, loss, loneliness.. these things are the real lows of the human experience.  me 1000 days ago would have drank these feelings away.  i wanted to post this to share with you guys that im not doing that this time.  im allowing myself to feel them, and i of course remain fully committed to my sobriety above all else.  its really hard, and it hurts a lot.  it makes sense that alcohol is a common crutch.  but that path is one i am incapable of taking responsibly, so instead i am choosing to have faith that the pain will, as it has in the past, dull on its own with time.   
   
whatever youre going through, think about tomorrow.  and the next day, and next month and next year.  where do you want to be?  these past 4 weeks have been some of the most emotionally challenging of my adult life.  but i dont want to be dead next year.  so for that guy, and the guy who has to look himself in the mirror tomorrow, and for the new puppy i get next week, and for the new woman i meet next month.. i choose to stay sober now.  i actually have to, there is no other real choice.  all those things disappear if i dont.  
  
anyway this post was mostly for me, i have very little in the way of outlets and i suppose i just wanted to say some of these things.  nevertheless thanks for reading, and be well",35,0

But I keep coming back to loneliness which is the main reason why I keep drinking. I've been able to get one sober day in per week for the last month, but it's been really hard because I'm about to turn 30 and I don't have any plans for the day, and that's really bringing me down.

I've really been trying, I put myself out there, and I've got some acquaintances now. However, I'm still at a place where I'm putting in the majority of the work trying to build the friendship and plan events, which just leaves me depressed because I'm constantly throwing myself into new things while getting almost nothing in return.

I was on a real streak for the last couple weeks, but the closer I get to the day of reckoning the more I feel compelled. I've cut down on the amount of time-traveling, though, so that's progress. For a while I was time-traveling each night, now, my drinking nights are often 3-4 drinks max and I almost always remember going to bed. 

I get that achieving lasting sobriety will make this process of building a social circle easier, but it's just so fucking depressingly hard, and it feels like it's just going to be this unending slog of ultimately unengaging social connections. I get that I just need to be stronger, take it one day at a time, whatever, but it just gets so exhausting and getting blotto was always a way to short circuit that. Of course, I've recently hit the point where getting blackout isn't even a way out anymore, my mood tends to really plummet.

I get it, I'm going to keep trying. I'm just tired of the stoicism and the endless frustration of constantly just toughing through another day. More than anything, I wish I had someone to lean on for once. I feel like I had so many great opportunities, and now we're just stuck in this unending nightmare world of COVID variants and cancellations and online-only events. More than anything, I want to just sit around a campfire or something with someone else and just stay up until dawn talking, and be 100% present and feel everything together.",3,1

We all have, it normally starts with a bloody mary in the am and goes all day. I tried not to think too much about the trip and how I'd manage to be sober. 

Today we've been walking around to different casinos and gambling and even went to 2 breweries.... and they've all been drinking pretty heavily. The booze is mostly free, so it's flowing pretty good. I've almost completed my first day here and am 100% sober which is interesting, to say the least. They're all hammered and I'm partaking in the conversation and ""fun"" but not the drinking. It's SO different to watch everyone and have this year be so different than other years. I'm over 6 months sober and want to keep going..... it's not worth messing up this streak.

Back in 2019 I lost my job and worked  any calls I could get from the entertainment industry. I put my heart and soul into it for 8 years, but it perpetuated a lot of my bad drinking habits. The hours were never consistent, you spent all your time chasing calls and making yourself available. Your a slave to the system but if you know how to work it the money can be good. Call it a labor of love if you will. As things slowed down I knew I needed a job full time and health insurance for a surgery. I took a job I hated but one that got me the surgery I had desperately needed for 7 years. With the pandemic, the industry had no work and stopped calling me but I kept working all through it.

I switched jobs back in November and I've been working more in HR now doing wfh. It's ok pay but it's consistent pay, hours, and health insurance. I've been here for 10 months and have been studying up a Scrum Master certification to take by the end of the year and start working as a Project Manager by 2022. Lately the entertainment industry just got back to work and I've turned down a couple calls because I can't just call off of work randomly, I took a PTO day to work something I knew I'd get called for but I still have these pangs of guilt. Did I chose the wrong path after all this time? I know my drinking was at its worst when I was working in that industry but I was so passionate about it. I like my work now too and can see myself Project Managing, I know I can do that. I'm much more well adjusted now too with a routine schedule and 2 solid years of therapy to help with my drinking problem. I don't know why I want to go back to the very thing that hurt me and yet here I am just wanting to numb this feeling. Everyone in my old industry keeps guilt tripping me and asking when I'm gonna quit the 9 to 5 and just come back. They keep telling me how I'm missing out on the ""money"" and it feels like that but I remember before everything paused it wasn't consistent and the numbers were never enough even though I'm paid less now.

Right now its been 6 days and 14 hours since my last drink. The first few nights i couldn't sleep at all and i was experiencing these really awful hallucinations. At the ER all I was given was nausea medication, which did help a lot after the second day, but I was up all night tossing in bed with my boyfriend, every time I closed my eyes I was feeling phantom touches and hearing people speak to me and being transported into a weird situation, in which id open my eyes and realize only three minutes passed. 

During this time I was talking to my mom every now and then, shes currently in our home country overseas and has a shitty connection, along with the time difference being 8 hours. I told her everything in a message which she responded to later offering her support and it wasn't until the fourth day that we could video chat.

She's vaccinated, but lost all taste and smell and has the flu; same with all of my family there. They won't get tested as the nearest site is over an hour drive for them, but since my mom is fully vaccinated, i think she has the delta variant? I dont know much about it, all I know is i am terrified for her life and the life of all of my baby cousins and aunts and uncles. I'm so scared. I dont want anything to happen to them. 

My mom won't take it seriously. Shes a very ""death will come when it's meant to"" type of person, and since shes been feeling better lately from being sick, she doesn't really care and is going out to the market this week once she feels better even without taste or smell. I yelled at her, so frustrated she won't even isolate and nor will my family; all they care about is how they lost their taste and can't eat food anymore. One of my neices is really ill too..

When I heard this I was in my bfs kitchen which is filled with liquor, including some of my own alcohol i gave to him, and all I wanted was to chug chug chug and cry. My mom is thousands of km away. I dont know what to do. I'm getting kicked out of my home in three weeks with no job or future apartment. I finished most of my organizing of my belongings today, I just need to put them in boxes, but I have nowhere to go besides my bfs.

Now starting an out-patient program.,I finally admitted to myself I need therapy for an array of issues. One of those being alcohol. I tried to control my drinking and for a week was doing well but then it wasn't fine. Many years of drinking and being in some not so great situations. I called the mental health services and the psychologist explained an out-patient 3 week program they offer for people whom need it urgently. I figured I was 'messed up in the head' but didn't realize to what extent. I'm mainly admitting this to myself for my son and don't want the same childhood for him I had. I guess trying to break the family trauma cycle so to speak. Hopefully 3 weeks for 9-12 hours a week will be enough. Not really sure what to expect but willing to try it.,5,0

I'm trying to get physically sober but my body is resisting & revolting the changes. I made it 7 days, and my body treated me like I was killing myself.. I know thats withdrawal. I don't want to be physically sober only 7 days at a time.

What happened was I quit alcohol cold turkey. I went to the gym, I ate fruits and veggies, took my multivitamins and for the first 3 days my body had a tantrum. Everything ran through me. I staved off cravings but by day 5\~6, I could feel my body was flipping me the double bird.. like ""ok if you aren't going to give me what I want - watch this""... day 6-7, I started retaining water like crazy, stomach distended, face looked round as a moon, and it was really uncomfortable. Not painful like a hangover when I was drinking but it started to make me really pissed off. Here I was doing everything right and my body was fighting against me. Day 7, I couldn't take it anymore, I was so uncomfortable. I had a few drinks (because I know alcohol is a diuretic) and guess what... I urinated out 2 lbs! My stomach was flat again...

How do I do this? Who has gone before me on this. How do I get my body to physically accept no-more. I'm back to day 1 and thats ok, I did it before I can do it again.. but how do I get past this point. QUESTION: how do I get my body to not react the way it did.. or how long does it take for your body to accept the change if this is something I just need to push through?

Please no 12-step answers, I'm looking for how to make a physical change.

Thanks everyone.",4,0

Today I've decided to stop drinking. 

I started drinking at 15, being a dumb high schooler going to parties or drinking in secret with friends. 

Nothing really consistent and honestly I think it was normal for most kids that age. I remember really looking up to upper classmen I was friends with who drank consistently every weekend. 

I wanted to be popular/cool lol. My family drinks a lot on both sides and I just thought that was a way to be a man. 

My father was never really in my life, and I always wanted male acceptance. 

Got a fake ID at 20 (dumb right?) and continued to drink consistently at bars with friends, where I experienced 30-40 lbs of weight gain since then (booze/bad food for hangovers). 

Drinking has given me severe anxiety/depressive thoughts the next day, and sometimes even the day after. 

Knowing my familial history with mental illness and how my father is (alcoholic), it's time for me to stop. 

I always take it too far; one drink turns into 5+, feeling super groggy at work the next day and barely able to focus or get anything done. 

I've said some very mean things to people, done even meaner things, and see no upside to drinking. 

I've gotten lucky quite a few times.

I'm finally at a point in my life where I'm financially stable, growing in my career, and drinking can derail all of that - I have so much to lose. 

I actively go to therapy and have had tremendous growth - for the first time in my life I told myself ""I love myself"" last month. 

I love myself enough to be present in this life, and I don't want to miss a thing. 

I've been a long time lurker and finally found the strength to post on here. You're all an inspiration.",5,0

Case and point a friend I consider a really good one. His drinking has gone up drastically over the past several years. I‚Äôm talking 6 strong drinks on the rocks snd is able to wake at 6 am and workout the next day. 

I consider this person dear friend but is flaky. There‚Äôs always an excuse why we make plans and cancels. ‚ÄúI was exposed to covid, I have to work, etc.‚Äù. 

I get it. Plans change. I Adapt. I‚Äôve had to cancel too. 

But once friend found out I‚Äôm not drinking for a while (indefinite time) he ghosted me. Then texts me the am of our brunch date and says he‚Äôs been exposed to covid and he didn‚Äôt want to expose me and my family. I cannot argue with that. 

I later see him posting drinking said hard drinks at a restaurant on social with another friend. 

I‚Äôm hurt and feel as if friend doesn‚Äôt value relationship , and he picked a better offer where drinking was involved. I also get friend will always pick booze over anything.

Is it time to let go of there friendships with Chronic drinkers on my path to quitting?

The weed aspect is fine, weed would make me aggressive if I didn‚Äôt smoke the next day. Alcohol yeah I‚Äôd get hangovers but only if I drank a lot.

Anyways, I miss drinking, I hate abstaining at parties or social gatherings where I can‚Äôt even enjoy a beer.

Now I'm 17 days sober and I am looking at the big picture here, the one I couldn't see before, or maybe this is just me, idk. I can see how ridiculous it is drink every single week just because there's live music and other people hanging out. Maybe if it was only a drink or two, some food and then go home but everyone always ends up getting sloshed, staying for hours, and staying into the wee hours. 

Drunk people are so fucking annoying to be around when you're sober and doing it at least once a week, sometimes more if there's more going on on the weekends, is getting old fast.

To cut a long story short, he was a lifelong alcoholic and chain smoker who died of a cancer that was made infinitely more likely to happen because of these two things. 

Anyway, due to waiting for covid restrictions to be lifted in my country + other reasons, it's taken til now to have a proper memorial/wake for him which is this weekend. A lot of the people who are going to be there will be his drinking buddies, his drinking buddy girlfriend, his equally drink heavy siblings etc, none of whom I've actually met up with since I made the choice to not drink. It doesn't help that my brother and mother have made their decisions not to go (and frankly I don't blame either of them) so it's kinda just me vs them if that makes any sense.

Every time I think about this event, I want to vomit. I'm stressed about the pressure I'm going to have to face when I tell all these people that, no, I'm not drinking, or listen to them ramble on about how great he was after they themselves have gotten drunk. (and spoiler, he wasn't a great man, he was incredibly abusive to my mother to the point that when they eventually divorced he fully threatened to murder her. He's also about 70% responsible for every drop of self doubt and feelings I'll never be anything in life). 

I'm scared I'm going to just crack and end up having a drink just to get them all to get off my back or to stop me having a massive panic attack. Rationally, I know I'm stronger than that, but there's just a voice in my head telling me that the only way to last longer than 10 minutes in the place (which is a pub, which just feels so...ironic but also apt given the whole situation) and it's driving me mad.

If anyone has any advice on how I can prepare myself enough to stay on the straight and narrow, or how to explain the situation of not drinking without having to be horrible about it (I don't think just pointing at the urn when anyone asks will be a....conducive way to do this somehow) I'd really appreciate it.

I've had the same counselor since the pandemic, which is roughly the day I gave up drinking. And we were talking about reasons people get excessively drunk. This got me thinking about my own experience with alcohol, which is unique to me, but perhaps many of you will relate.

My style of drinking was multiple days of no alcohol, followed by a longer stretch of maintenance-style drinking all throughout the day with the occasional real binge. Sometimes purposeful, other times accidental. I am intrigued by these accidental incidents because sometimes, during one of these maintenance-style drinking benders, I would get so excessively drunk but somehow have the wherewith-all to think to myself ""how the fuck did this happen I can barely stand up"" . It was really weird, because it was as if my tolerance was high enough to allow me to still be conscious even though I couldn't walk or talk right (geeze that sounds bad). 

Anyway, my conclusion is that there is essentially an objective drunk and a subjective drunk. Objective drunk is directly related to your BAC and the state says it occurs around .08. Subjective drunk, on the other hand, is that feeling that we chase. That warmness. The confidence, and the illusory clarity. When you're young and drinking is more novel, this 'subjective drunk' occurs quickly and easily, often before the 'objective drunk'. So we just think that alcohol = that feeling. Often for years. This creates a very strong neural network in the brain. As we continue chasing the dragon, the sea-saw eventually flips, to where it takes so much alcohol to satisfy our brains that our bodies cannot keep up. More and more alcohol for an increasingly fleeting reward. What an awful situation to be in: a brain that needs something that the body cannot take. You see it often; continued drinking despite failing health.

This is the best way I can describe what happened to me, many times. By understanding my behaviors like this more clearly, I feel better positioned to defend temptation. It offers insight into my brain compulsions and illuminates patterns that I still exhibit to this day. I hope that some of you feel the same, and that this helps someone not drink today.",9,1

The good feelings lasted for about two hours. And now I'm coming down and starting to feel sick. Better keep drinking. In my fantasy I thought I could have a few and my wife wouldn't know, but that's not going to work because I reek of booze. So that will be a fun conversation. And now it's the next day and I have 24 hours of hangover ahead of me. And now I'm craving alcohol again. And now it's a struggle to not do it again every single day. 

In conclusion, I think I'll just ignore my thinking today. It's a beautiful day to be sober. Cheers.",95,0

I was a bit skeptical at first, and as I wouldn't consider myself a huge drinker, I always kept the same desire to drink. So after reading through this book I started to feel great, like it was truly changing my perspective on drinking. Now that it is all said and done, it's been about a month since my last drink, and truly don't want to. Even times were I normally would, like after a long day of work, or out on the golf course, the thought crosses my mind and then quickly goes away due to thinking about all the negatives. 

  
So my question to anyone who has read the book, does this feeling stay with you? Will I soon be whisked away by another drink after another month, or even after a full year? As of right now I have written down a few reasons why I believe I won't, and I am not necessarily nervous that I will start to drink again, but just wonder if this is my new normal? Going to work functions/family gatherings almost excites me now to think that I don't have to worry about all the problems that associate with alcohol. I will say however the one thing I do worry about is learning how to socialize...Haha that was always much easier to do with a bit of impaired judgement, but I am up for the challenge!",12,0

Last Thursday we were visiting my parents and I got so drunk I don't remember going to bed. I basically stole a bunch of wine from my mom, acted like a total asshole in front of my kids, really bothering my oldest daughter, and woke up the next morning still noticeably drunk.

Later in the afternoon we were on our way out to our campsite to set up and meet up with our friends. On the way I was so upset and disgusted with myself I had unbuckled my seatbelt and popped the passenger side door intending to just jump out on the highway. My wife stopped me. I was going to do this in front of all 3 of my kids. It's the lowest I'd ever been.

Move to today and my wife is asking me to change my depression meds, but I know that they are not the problem. My alcoholism is a major component of my mental and emotional issues, so I told her what I really need to do is quit fucking drinking once and for all. She then told me that if I buy any beer this week/weekend she is done with me. 

I don't have any money until Friday so I'm good until then, but I really hope that when Friday comes I will be able make the proper choice and not give in again like I always do. This time I could lose my entire family, and I still can't say for sure I won't choose beer over them when the time comes. I feel like a lost cause, I feel like a failure.

 If you've never been to a homeless shelter or the like take my advice: do everything in your power to prevent that NOW, even if you have everything sorted in your life. Have a back up plan, a back up pay if you manage it, do fucking ANYTHING to stay out of this situation.

Last year on August 11th I was down in the dumps trying to rebuild my life. 
Today on August 11th I look back and how much I've grown in a year and how much I have accomplished the unexpected. 
I don't plan to necessarily go forever without drinking, but I still don't really plan on drinking in the future.

Irony is I kind of forgot that today was my one year and someone had to tell me to remind me.

That's how long it's been, how little power it holds, and how far gone alcohol has left my mind, at least on a day-to-day basis. 

Sometimes it's hard to socialize without drinking still today and sometimes I drink non alcoholic beers to blend in, but the important part is that I did it. 
I went a whole year without drinking alcohol.

It wasn't as bad as I thought, I learned a lot about myself, I met sober friends, rediscovered passions, saved a lot of money, and now if I ever decide I wanted drink again, I think I can do it with much more control. 

Having said that, I don't really see the need to continue drinking now. It's hard to put hard fast rules on yourself like I'm never going to do x or y, but doing so at least for a little bit of time helps you see what's worth cutting out and what you can live without.

Wherever you're at in your journey, I hope you are doing well. 

I don't plan on drinking today to ""celebrate."" I thought I would when I hit one year , but it really isn't that important now.

Tomorrow may be different, and thats ok, it's a daily choice to not drink. There may be a time when I decide I do want to but at least it's not coming from an addictive habit, it'll probably come from curiosity to which I'll be sorely disappointed if I ever do again I bet...

I don't know where to begin, I'm a little all over the place so whoever is willing to read this and give me their opinion I genuinely appreciate it.

I'm having a big conflict recently with my drinking habits. I've always been a happy positive person, I'm a bright, altruistic person. I don't use alcohol to cope with sadness, or am an angry drunk, my evenings usually end with really enjoying a typically healthy dinner in a slightly drunken state and singing songs, playing a few games I like, and hopping into bed. I don't always remember getting in bed, but really even recently I think I've been better about my drinking than I did in the past, cause I've been trying to get an understanding of it all with my recent concerns.

I really started drinking to help me sleep, I don't think about alcohol during the day, I don't like day drinking, brunch mimosas, or getting drunk at bars, embarrass myself in public, like at BBQ's nothing. I can very much control my drinking in social situations. I just like to come home, and right around the time I am winding down for the day I drink heavily, anywhere from 7-10 shots of tequila within a two hour time frame, give or take, and spend the last few hours of my evening just goofing around. I'd like to add that I do this before having dinner. My tolerance I think is the problem. I've always had a high tolerance, but the consumption is worrying me. Am I addicted? My mind says it doesn't know. But maybe my body does. I don't see the ways that people typically say there are signs of a problem. I can be hung over here and there like any normal person but ultimately I'm doing really well right now in my life and I'm happy. I drink a TON of water before bed and throughout the day I make sure I'm in good health. Although I do have moderately high blood pressure that I'm sure alcohol is contributing to, but no concerns otherwise. I do probably yawn more than normal and feel a bit tired sometimes, but my mind is very active and sharp. With Covid I decided to start  therapy last year and still do and feel like its done wonders for me.  I do come from a troubled childhood, my mother always drank heavily, and it wasn't easy growing up. However, I get along with everyone, I'm doing great with my job, I'm a good partner to my spouse, aside from being tucked into bed when I'm too tired because I tend to obviously drink too much but I also push myself very hard so sometimes I'm mentally and physically exhausted and the alcohol just exacerbates that, I work out (not in perfect shape but I exercise is my point), I have goals that I achieve them, I work hard, I'm very supportive to all my friends and family (which are all going through a lot of heavy stuff right now), etc... I'm really happy and enjoying life right now. That also say that they know I drink a lot because I'm open about it, but don't worry or think I have a huge problem, but could probably cut back.

However, there's the drinking. That worry in the back of my mind that I am hurting my body or what if I can't stop. I read all the time how unhealthy this is.  And I want to stop, but I don't want to stop.  I quit for about a week last year, and before hand I was REALLY anxious about the idea of not drinking, ultimately it just resulted in a week of boring nights and going to bed early. I know it seems I'm trying to justify my drinking, which in turn should be a clear sign that I do have a problem. I don't mean to trigger anyone and maybe this is not the subreddit to be posting this in. I'm just grappling with it all. People say before you know it, you're drinking a bottle a day. Or you'll be drunk at work. And I can't imagine myself getting to that point. But I'm also struggling to feel that maybe I don't have as much control as I think I do. Because I tell myself during the day like, Oh I'll just have a wine tonight, or, I just wanna lay in bed and not drink at all. Especially lately, the last week or two, I'm testing myself, I've been really thinking about it and realizing I'm not sticking to the drinking goals I set for myself.

I worry that without control can't get it back. My tolerance is too high, getting higher even. Do I need rehab? I tend to be a dramatic, worry wart. Am I just overthinking all of this and just need to not give this fear so much power and just cut back and live my life and be happy? Or, fuck it. Maybe it's as simple as (as I said I drink mainly to wind down and sleep) and take a melatonin. I had a sleep medication once before but that made me feel more fucked up than the alcohol did. But ultimately, I just like the drunk feeling. I'm highly functioning. I like the feeling of not focusing on the world, my life, and everyone else's. I am acutely aware of everything around me when I'm sober, its exhausting sometimes. It's maybe become almost meditative. I don't know. I wonder if it's because the pandemic? I don't know.

To wrap it all up. I'm a little scared. I'm scared to post this, to be judged, to be honest. I'm scared to feel misunderstood or say something wrong, or be offensive, or triggering. I keep to myself. I just would like a break from the way I think about my drinking. It makes me feel like a bad person. When I know I'm not. I feel I wrote way too much, but also have so much more to say. I appreciate the feedback, and any advise. I'm really at a point where I desperately need it.",7,2

In my experience addiction tricked me into thinking it was just a very effective self-prescribed medicine I needed a little bit of every day. I hid some in my room in case I needed a little extra. Life kept happening, never getting less stressful, and my coping mechanism started to have some negative side effects. I continued to drink for years. Why? That‚Äôs where addiction tricked me. It is a symptom of untreated addiction to continue a behavior that I don‚Äôt like. Everything else I hate, I quit. So why do I hate/love alcohol, what is this feeling?

The first month of aches and pains. The second month of almost turning back to alcohol. The deep depression, the suppressed anger, guilt and anxiety rising up and daring me to face them head on.

It‚Äôs not easy, and for good reason. The issues that I had brushed under the carpet rose up and I faced them one by one. The evenings that I used to spend pouring myself a glass after glass; I spent pouring tears- tears of healing, tears of understanding, tears of forgiveness. 

I am still working on it, it did get easier, friends understood, the dynamics of our meet-ups changed from late nights to sober brunches. 

I understood my triggers and worked on them. I am working on building broken relationships in the family, I am working to make amends. The guilt of alcohol induced madness will always remain, but I shall work through that as well.

One year ago, I admitted myself into a rehab, not knowing how to get a grip on my life then. A year later, I am in my dream job, with fulfilling friendships and the hope for renewed familial relationship.. and a newer, kinder relationship with me.

Am I happy, maybe not. Am I more peaceful? Yes. Less anxious? Yes. Less angry? yes. More grateful ? Yes. Willing to stay alive? Yes yes and Oh yes.!

Beautiful scenery and fun events, marred only by the extra-large focused-in shot of the beer/drink/bloody mary I was drinking.  Picture after picture, of drinks and people with drinks. There was no event that didn't involve drinking, no day that wasn't cut short by heading back to the room to drink, no destination that wasn't ignored over looking for a bar.  

It's not regret that I feel, really--it's like when you've been really sick and then you really appreciate feeling good afterward.  I know what I know, I do not crave or think back on those days with anything other than the delicious realization of knowing my life has opened up now. Days are long and full, where they were once abbreviated to make room for the drinking hours.  I don't watch the clock, I don't rearrange my schedule, I don't turn away opportunities to make room for drinking.  That gnawing, unscratchable itch...is gone.  Its memory keeps me on the path I'm on.

I am celebrating the fact that it has been 150 days without getting drunk! I cannot believe how much faster the last 50 days have gone by than when I was in the double digits. I think my mind is focused on other things than the fact that I'm not drinking so the days feel shorter.

I won't lie, there is a small part of me that feels like maybe my 150 days aren't 100% legit. I had a non-alcoholic beer during that time but it actually had 0.3% alcohol in it. And occasionally I have to take a tiny sip at work to know what a feature cocktail or new draft beer tastes like so I can provide feedback and better describe it to interested customers (I work in a restaurant setting). I always try to take the smallest taste possible so that I taste it but don't feel any sort of buzz. So even though I can't say that I have never had a sip in 150 days, I can say I have spent the last 150 days with a sober and clear mind.

I am down almost 30 pounds, up $3000, in a better work place, and much happier in general. I have a big challenge coming up in the next week - my first vacation, but I'm so motivated that I know I'll succeed at sticking to my goals. I know I'll be posting plenty here duriong that time.

To be honest I'm glad something finally pushed me over the edge because it was going to happen eventually.  It's nice to be freed of a curse after dealing with it for 10 years.  I won't say the first 10 years of drinking wasn't relatively enjoyable, until I discovered the magic cure for a hangover was a shot or two.  The next 10 years was the curse.

I'm so much healthier, happier and present now.  I'm still nowhere close to serenity, but every day I do seem to get a little closer.  Most importantly, everyone in my house is doing better.  Amazing the difference having two parents instead of three kids in the house.",14,1

My friend finally decided to quit drinking. He is currently in the hospital doing a detox. The only reason I managed to get him to go was because he started hearing voices.

Originally he was checked into a mental health facility, but he eloped from there and was taken to the hospital after they found him and he was having very bad physical symptoms. We are all hoping it is just from quitting booze (he drank 2-3 pints a day for about 3 years.)

 I'm just hoping to find more information on the subject than what I'm finding on google... I guess more informed and personal experiences.

Maybe someone else would be comfortable with a comfortable relationship but I guess I see now that he isn't the man I thought he was. He is a good man but we are two ships passing in the dark and that won't change because who he is, it won't change. I tried so long but I see now all my trying was for naught. 

So the point is here, these feelings are the ones I'd drink away. I was giving my child a bath and wasn't really present in that the crushing loneliness held me and I was looking out of the door and thinking was this it? I did everything I could to just sit in those feelings and shortly after, the feeling albeit here is slightly less and the desire to drink and drown them, gone.

In the manner of a true alcoholic, I even quit more than once in a day sometimes. But I could quit for longer too. I could take a week off, or a month. I took six months off one time, because I had a stressful piece of contract work, and I needed to be sharp.

I quit a *lot*. I did it to feel like I had control over my drinking. *Obviously* it doesn't control me, right? I can take a month off starting right now, see? And I'd do it. I could leave a half a pint on the bar, and quit for a month, just right on the spot.

And then 30 days later I'd start drinking again, and in a week I'd be drinking every day, generally starting at noon. 

Never quite got dysfunctional. Kept my job, my family. I'd quit to diet sometimes, so I didn't even gain that much weight.

And I really thought that meant I was on top of it, that I *controlled* it. 

But in my head I was always a person who drank. I may not have been drinking right then but I was just waiting until I could drink again, and I knew exactly when that would be. I mean, I'd be more likely to forget my birthday than I would to forget the day when I could start drinking again.

So I quit again, a couple months ago. Summer was gearing up, and I was just tired of drinking. Just tired right down to the bottom.

I did all the usual things: I avoided the drinking people, I avoided the places where I drank, I picked up the exercise, put time into the hobbies. All the distract-y stuff. Worked fine, as it usually does, but there is always that dangerous moment when you relax, and go back to one of your haunts.

Last week, I went to this local Mexican place. One of those places where I'd go for ""lunch"", and be there for a few hours? You know the place.

And I went there for lunch, sat at the bar, ordered iced tea, and I just ate lunch. And the only regret I had was that I ate too much.

And I was walking afterward, and I realized that I was actually thinking of myself as a person who doesn't drink. Not as a person who isn't drinking *right now*. Not a person who is ""taking a break"". I'm not quitting for a month, or until I've lost weight, or until I've finished a project, or whatever. I'm just done.

I don‚Äôt drink every day, at worst I would drink every other day. Usually once on a Friday and then again on Sunday, unless something comes up like a birthday or Christmas and then who knows. But when I do drink it‚Äôs to get so drunk that I have to pass out, usually black out.

I don‚Äôt black out all the time but when I do the next day my wife tells me about something I‚Äôve done it attempted to do. I might have got irrationally angry, or tried to pee in the bedroom. It‚Äôs so embarrassing. I am hating the hangovers, I‚Äôm useless, nothing gets done, even worse if I drank on a school night or a Sunday because then working from home, nothing got done. Then the fear came, do my colleagues notice I‚Äôm doing nothing. Does my wife secretly hate me. 

My wife never told me not to drink, she‚Äôs the sweetest, but sometimes if I said I was nipping out to ‚Äúget a few beers‚Äù I could see the disappointment in her eyes. If I asked her if she minded she would say no, I knew really she did though. 

Nearly 10 days ago I was scrolling Reddit, so hungover and I can across a post from here, talking about ‚Äúhey you, lurking with a hangover‚Äù it felt like it was just specifically written for me.

Since then I've developed a lot and can operate much better in the world. My problems are still there but they can be dealt with and addressed now where it all just seemed so helpless before. I'm more productive at work. My finances are better. Old hobbies are engaging again, and I'm in a relationship now after years of being single. Anxiety is still an issue, but it's generally lower and easier to handle. Socially, it hasn't been such a big deal, although COVID might help with that.

It took a while to get educated and for a few concepts and tools to gel in my mind. Reading generally, including this sub, helps‚Äîboth the sage advice from old hands and the disastrous tales that serve as grim reminders. If you can stomach it, learning from medical sources can be a wakeup call. And every failed attempt is an opportunity for education. It was frustrating to fail at first, but in hindsight it was unrealistic to expect a sudden switch in such an ingrained behaviour.

The most useful tools for me were taking it one day at a time, playing the tape forward when tempted, identifying and avoiding triggers, and especially really internalising that *moderation doesn't work*. Being aware of the pink cloud was also useful, as well as just accepting that different people have different responses to alcohol.

I am newly sober and started The Alcohol Experiment by Annie Grace. The first piece of homework is to write out all the reasons why you drank and then write out all the reasons why you want to quit. The objective (as I understand it) is to begin a process of changing your subconscious view of alcohol. And holy cow it‚Äôs sobering.

Firstly, my list of reasons to quit was about 3 times longer. But perhaps more importantly the reasons to drink were at complete odds with why I want to quit. E.g. ‚ÄòI have more fun when I drink‚Äô vs ‚Äòit increases my suicidal thoughts‚Äô‚Ä¶.

CLEARLY I am not having more fun when I drink if that is one of the reasons I want to stop. It sounds obvious but getting it down on paper really helped me put motivation into perspective.

I am listening to the audiobook and there are some videos as well. Found it in the wiki of this awesome sub. 

Hope this helps any newly or OG sober folks out there.

But the relief I felt when I woke and saw it was a nightmare rekindled my need to stay on this path irrespective of how hard everything feels right now.

I'm struggling in a lonely marriage, in a career I am trying to ignite and a baby that I love but still adds to daily stress. I have a pretty bad relationship with my family so can't rely on them for help or rather I would prefer not to as don't want them coloring my baby with negativity.

So wasn't my intention to set out all grim sounding but I want to be honest. It's not easy. As I worked today I had a vague notion that it would be so much easier if I drank and dealt with my problems later but I can't keep kicking the bucket and hoping tomorrow spells a better day.

If I go to the break room, everyone is talking about their kids. I have no kids. Everyone is complaining about their relationships. I'm happily engaged.

I never was physically addicted but I would have a 6 pack more-or-less around 3 times a week (and several years ago I would binge). I decided 3 weeks ago I'm done after several ""sober <month>"" challenges. It was taking more to get the good feeling, waking up foggy (rarely hungover) sucked, losing time to do things I enjoy sucked, etc. I'd like to clean up my diet and improve my lipid panel so I decided now's a good time to stop while I am young before I end up doing permanent damage (or, more accurately, more than I may have already done and just not been bad enough to show symptoms). I've been charting my mental state carefully. Aside from some mildly elevated lipids my bloodwork (which runs in my family anyway, unfortunately) has been normal. It's time to optimize.

I noticed the first week the psychological addiction was strong but tolerable. I didn't need it, but I certainly wanted it. I live in a house with drinkers and I can't expect them to bend to my needs so I also got the opportunity to say *no* enough times I reinforced it in my head. 

Second week was ironically the easiest. Not a single craving all week. Woke up every day and spent it lucid. An incredible feeling. I was able to do things I couldn't do before! I went for night walks, drives out late at night, and was able to even work on somethings that took more brain power than youtube videos. 

But now, sitting at the third week the psychological addiction has come back even stronger. I attribute this to training my brain's pleasure receptors and they're in their begging stage of denial trying to convince to take one more sip. Like a demon walking behind you gently prodding you to see how far it can get. I'm not concerned I will slip, but I am annoyed at the level of effort it is taking to push the thought of drinking out of my head. I walk by my roommate's bottles of booze, see their booze in the fridge, etc and there isn't a single temptation. But the nagging feeling continues. I'm attributing this to not only the pleasure receptors getting used to being without the easy dopamine of booze, but also increased social pressure and exposure (a sort of pavlovian response to seeing it). Commercials with booze have started to grate me. This reinforces to me that despite not having a physical addiction the real demon is the psychology. At the end of the day you can pull the bottle away but you still need to deal with your demons to be successful. I feel so much better and so much more energetic. I've already lost a few pounds, I'm better hydrated, and am getting more done. This has been such a net good for me it makes me angry I even started.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy hump day, SD!  Yesterday we discussed how contingency plans can help keep your good intentions on track, and today I‚Äôd like to talk some more about how we can avoid being derailed by the unexpected.  Sometimes bad things happen, and it often finds us unprepared. Brace yourselves, we are heading into choppy waters.

A few years ago, I had my entire world turned upside down in a single, devastating conversation.  I was traumatised and completely unprepared to deal with the ensuing uphill struggle to rebuild my life. I already had an unhealthy attachment to alcohol, but as I turned to it more and more as a coping mechanism, my life slowly spiraled into chaos. Since regaining a level of control, I‚Äôve tried to become more resilient, and in searching through the vast resources available on this topic, I came across a moving and powerful Ted Talk from Lucy Hone called The Three Secrets of Resilient People.  Lucy is a resilience expert, and she has suffered the sudden, tragic loss of a child, so her talk is from the heart.  If you have 20 minutes and are feeling emotionally robust, check it out on YouTube.  Here is a quick summary:

1.	Bad stuff happens

‚Ä¢	Life is hard, and disaster can strike at any time, but it‚Äôs the same for all of us. Resilient people accept that pain and loss are a normal part of life, and don‚Äôt take it as a personal attack from the universe.

2.	Tune into the good in your world

‚Ä¢	Resilient people develop the skill of focusing their attention where it will serve them best.  They don‚Äôt spend all their time obsessing over things that can‚Äôt be changed, but look for the good things, or the things that can be made better. They regularly practice gratitude and are healthier and less depressed as a result.

3.	Ask ‚ÄúIs this helping or harming me?‚Äù

‚Ä¢	Resilient people learn to examine their behaviours and ask if what they are doing is helpful or harmful.  They take control of their decision making with this simple question, reduce harmful behaviours (such as wallowing in dark thoughts) and are kind to themselves.

On my birthday, which is Thursday!, I will hit 83 days sober! I imagine what the date would look like, what it would feel like. I have to say, it lived up to my expectations! I know I'm not quite there yet but I'm sure my birthday I will be busy and not be on Reddit lol

When  I got sober, It was the end of May so pretty much the beginning of summer here in Texas. I couldn't imagine then going the whole summer without drinking and even though I still have a month to go before summer is over, it no longer feels like a pipe dream so to speak.

Even though I see many more Summers of not drinking, I know that I need to take it one day at a time and not focus on a day from now, a month from now or even 5 years from now! All I could do is control what I do today and hopefully that will make tomorrow better.

Unfortunately, Coronavirus hasn't heard about my birthday So I'm afraid it will be a bit scaled back. I'm planning on doing take out with a friend and just hanging out and talking.

As soon as the call was over a class mate called me and asked me if I wanted to talk, he said he was there for me.  I said thank you but I was fine.  He hesitated and said, ok but you are in my thoughts and I will be praying for you tonight.  I realized that at minimum, 1 person understood that I was not right. They probably discussed me behind my back, embarrassing.

Oh yeah, one day I woke up & was getting really for work feeling like shit.  I looked in the mirror & it looked like every blood vessel in my left eye had exploded.  30 minutes later, I ran into somebody I had not seen in a long while.  I'm vain and take really good care of myself (besides the drinking).  She looked at me and I saw a fleeting change in her expression. I got it.  She was taking in the bags under my eyes, the puffiness of my face, and was shocked at my appearance.

The night at a friends house, they are light mostly non drinkers. I drank a lot and it hit me in the bathroom when I stood up from the toilet.  I was doing that drunken sway and I reeled back and fell into their bath tub making a big bang and even more noise as I attempted to get up. The bathroom was at the other end of the house so I don't think they heard. I composed myself, focused on acting sober & said my goodbyes while I still had it semi together. They ghosted me.

The time I ran out of booze at home, I knew I could not drive.  I walked to the liquor store late at night in a sketchy neighborhood to get more alcohol.  I was shit faced concentrating on NOT weaving.  I remember a car full of men driving by and looking at me.  Then they did another slower drive by on that desolate street but I was not yet at an easy place where I could easily be scooped up, there was this fence that was a barrier.  I few more steps and I would have cleared that and been easy prey.  The street required the drivers to drive all the way down the hill before turning around to catch up to me.  I cleared that fence area and ran the half a block to my house.

Since then I have relapsed several times, but each time got back on the bandwagon for a week or so. I have an incredibly supportive home group and sponsor. Regardless, I continue to drink. 
I made a really great friend that I absolutely adored, but one thing we kept doing together was drinking. Two nights ago I over drank to the point to where he left me (and took my dog with him) in the city by myself at 2-3 AM. I was black out, lost my purse but luckily still had my phone. All I remember is him texting that he was going to take my dog to an animal hospital and he never wants to see me again. Now that I write it like that, I don't know why I continue to mourn the loss of this friendship. I am more embarassed that I was wondering around the neighborhood screaming my dogs name so late. I lost my purse that had my wallet and keys. I had to take an Uber home, break into my apartment building just to realize I locked my door. Luckily there are a few ladders in our garage so I had to climb a ladder into my apartment.

I know that where I am now is the consequences of my actions over the course of those 10+ years, however, I can't say I didn't have my own fair share of hardships and difficult times - the same as anyone else, however, I believe I have achieved a new level of rock bottom.

Over the years I have aliened many people due to my drinking; friends, communities, and now, even my family. We had a ""tradition"" in my family where we'd go out for dinner on birthdays and my birthday three weeks ago was not met with food and family but an email from my mother saying my entire family wants nothing to do with me more. 

I always thought if things got to this point, I wouldn't care, and yet, I find myself disappointed in myself, annoyed and even a little jealous that my entire family has disowned me and have instead focused solely on my sister and her new baby. 

So here I find myself; $1400 behind on rent - about to be $2400 (which will likely lead to eviction), in an argument with my mobile phone company about a payment and my service disconnected in the mean time, zero money and four packages of instant noodles as my only source of food for the foreseeable future. 

What's even more frustrating is despite my efforts, I've yet to find a job. McDonald's didn't even hire me. Not that getting a job interview would do much for me at this point since I can't even afford bus fare and (as silly as this sounds) my belt broke so I can't even wear proper pants to an interview. I've started trying to sell my furniture to play catch up on everything and was met with nothing but scams so far... which only fuels annoyance and frustration.

One of the few positives in this situation is I am ten days sober now. I am sleeping better and things are starting to feel more clear and focused. I'm not really sure what's going to happen in coming days and weeks, however, I imagine that all my pent up emotion is going to come out in one way or another - I just hope it's in a more productive way and not an alcohol consumption way.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Being able to have a community to vent to people who understand really helps. I hope everyone else is doing okay and staying sober.",49,0

I've been idealizing taking ""just a day off"" from sobriety to ""let loose and relax"" with alcohol and weed (I've been quitting both this year). 

And its got me thinking, what do I need to switch off from? Using a substance isnt going to magically make my problems and responsibilities disappear, it's not going to make my life easier to handle in the external sense. What it will do is numb and shut down my mind. 

So, if turning off the brain-wheel is the goal, why not try and find a method that doesnt involve poison? 

This is my plan: 
 - Curb the social media. Sorry reddit, but having all these different stories and voices in my head is tiring me out.
 - Plan a chill out day. No workout. No work. No chores. Just videogames, tv, and doing whatever the hell I want (which doesnt include relapsing, I dont actually want that)
 - Start meditating in the mornings. I already do yoga and meditate every evening (thanks sobriety for that my most cherished habit) and feel remarkable better afterwards. So starting my day with that too should yield benefits to the waking life.
 - Remember this could be PAWS and my brain is still healing. Cut myself some slack. Dont feel like I need to be hitting it every day, or advancing every day, or learning something every day. I'm enough as i am. I'm whole. Unclench, baby girl.

So what are your thoughts, sobernaughts? (He he that rhymes) What do you do to fill the 'need an off switch' void left by no longer numbing ourselves with alcohol? Have you noticed that is related to your cravings?

I only recently discovered this community and I cannot believe how much it has helped. I keep falling off the wagon, but have learned from you all to just dust myself off and get back on it! No shame and all the gain (to be had sober of course). 

I am posting this right now because I just have finished the last of my cigarettes, weed, and drank last night . I'm almost in a mini-panic, afraid of the upcoming work, buried emotions resurfacing, and the clarity that comes with sobriety. 

I know this board, community, is for us to help share our stories and to get us to stop drinking. We all seem to share commonalities with one another regarding our imbibery . 

I have a **question** to ask of you all:

Are you only quitting alcohol? Do you have more than one vice? 

If so, are you 'cold-turkeying' all of it at once?  Or choosing to eliminate each vice one-by-one?

I am finding that the *trifecta* is more of a *troika.* Each one nudges me to the impluse of the other. What is booze without the cigarrettes? Now your just missing the THC... Well, I am tired of being a slave to old, old habits. Wake'n Bake, choke on more Nicotine, counting the hours down, wishing for the sunset to mark the end of the day. This is no life. There is more to it. I should be, we should be out there extracting all the joy and magnifying it for ourselves so we can redistribute one day to others. Loving ourselves first, finally, so we can share that love with others.  

So I say, ""Hello World! I am coming for you"" -- I won't beat myself up too badly if I keep tripping and stumbling, but lord Almighty, or Castle Greyskull, give me the strength (I'll take whatever power from whatever positive deity there is at this point). Fark the Devil and his Drink.

I am 27 now and have been through various attempts at quitting at the behest of my wonderful wife, none of which were successful and many of which were doomed to failure from the start because I was in denial of having an issue. I just enjoyed having a few drinks, every single night. In the last year I have gained back 60lbs and stumbled my way down a bad path. I started hiding my drinking because of my wife's unhappiness with it. I also started smoking again and drinking a lot of beer to cover the smell of the whiskey and to provide what I thought was a suitable excuse for my ""light buzz"" (what I tried to tell my wife when she would accuse me, rightly, of drinking again).

She told me repeatedly that she was worried for my health, and that I should consider the immediate and long term effects it was having on me, my relationship with her, and my ability to be a good dad. I wrestled with this internally for months, and would run to the warmth and understanding of the whiskey to escape it. I knew it was doing seriously bad things to me; in addition to the heavy drinking I was also eating enormous quantities of terrible food, and frequently ordering Uber Eats etc, spending even more money we didn't have on slowly killing myself.

A week ago I finally opened up to my wife. I admitted that I am an alcoholic and that I am depressed and that I don't know what is wrong with me but I can't seem to beat this thing, even though I know how bad it is. She was so understanding. I don't know what I expected, but she showed up in a big way. I slipped a few times the last few day ones, but I am on the tail end of day two and feeling at peace with my decision to stop drinking. Fortunately, after years of about a pint of whiskey and two to four beers a night I am not experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, just the occasional serious craving. Cravings I know lead to nothing but shame, disappointment, physical and emotional pain. I am enjoying dinner and a cartoon with my kids; my wife is getting ready to run to Target for a few things before we go to bed, and I am excited to snuggle her while SOBER. I am excited to wake up at 3AM again tomorrow and have plenty of time to make breakfast and get ready before I head to work, clear headed and with a settled stomach like I enjoyed today. My wife sends me texts throughout the day encouraging me, telling me I can do this and that I am capable and how proud she is of me. It is so encouraging and it helps more than words can explain. I finally want to make her proud, make my kids proud, and make ME proud. I am ready to quit. Yes, I am quitting for them too, but I am quitting for myself as well, and I think that's a big part of why it hasn't stuck in the past. I'm happy, I'm supported, I'm loved, and I'm CONFIDENT. I don't want to drink. I don't want to sneak a beer or a shot or a sip of wine. I want to be sober and feel my feelings and share them with my wife and hold my kids and remember going to bed every night. I want to experience life, not just let it happen around me. I can do this, I will do this. IWNDWYT.",10,0

* cooked using my favorite wine and DID NOT DRINK A DROP!!!
* started listening to all my favorite music again and actually enjoyed it again
* went to the beach (huge drinking time for me in the past)
* got presented with an incredible business opportunity that would be a lot of changes for me
* was asked to represent my company at a business meeting tomorrow completely alone and unprepared (dont worry, Ive been prepping myself all day and Im excited for the challenge and chance to show my worth)
* started exercising and cut out my carbs

It's even pretty difficult to put into words now that I'm actually trying despite the thoughts flying through my head a million miles a minute. The important thing though, is stating again.

Back in high school, I was part of an improv club. Two phrases that came up often were ""Today is Tuesday, today is the day that something *happens*"" and ""kill the vampire"". These two things are meant to remind players that instead of talking about a thing happening or constant build up to a premise, you just dive in and do it. Common parlance would be ""s**** or get off the pot."" So that is what I'm doing now. Today *is* Tuesday (interestingly I happened to choose this name but wait 5 days to post to see if I could get some time) and I'm going to kill this vampire that has been draining my life of substance and richness for years. 

It wasn't until recently that all of the other aphorisms here finally clicked and made sense to me on a visceral level. I finally *am* sick and tired of being sick and tired. It really has become true that one is too much and a case is never enough. I can sacrifice everything for one thing or one thing for everything. These all felt like hollow clich√©s, until now.

Gah, this sucks to write, only because it's true. I went to my bachelor party at the end of July. Just some friends all hanging out for a weekend, nothing extravagant. Just some beer and bourbon, low key. On the last night I blacked out and during that time, after what had been an incredible time, I tried to grope my friend. I still don't know exactly what happened because now I've broken trust with all my grooms people and the wedding is right around the corner.

I already knew, going in to the weekend that I needed to slow down, pace myself, moderate. But that's about as useful as putting up a speed limit sign next to an F1 track. I failed. Again.

The worst part is that I did something to someone else. That was the wake up call to end all wake up calls. Waking up in a flower bed? Cool. Passing out and pissing myself on the couch? I'll just get some stain remover. Tripping down the stairs and busting my eyebrow open? Nothing some gauze can't handle. Being self destructive is one thing. Being abusive is something else.

It's absolutely disgusting me to my core and one of the only people I would go to when feeling this way is the person that now doesn't want to talk to me at all, and for a darn good reason. I don't make friends really, to such a degree that the wedding party consists of some of the only people I think are really my friends, especially while I'm drinking. The rest are people that are friendly, but I think are really just tolerating me.

I've had my own struggles outside of alcohol, and it only exacerbated them. Feelings of inadequacy, social ideation, imposter syndrome, depression, anxiety, panic attacks. What kicked things into overdrive was getting a promotion at work that I was working toward for years thinking ""this will fix things"" (hint: it never does). So I retreated. For the past 3-4 years I don't think I've gone to bed sober for more than a couple nights in a row, even if out and about with family and then coming home to the vodka hidden in the closet, or the garage, or the filling cabinet, or the flask in the jacket liner.

I don't really care what happens to me, but I worry for my bride, who deserves her magical day to be unsullied by my mistakes and being an awful human. I honestly never thought of even make it to where I am today in terms of everything I have. I always thought I'd just be alone forever. Now I'm worried that I may have screwed things up before they even started. Right now I'm feeling pretty F.I.N.E.

But today is Tuesday. Today is the day I kill the vampire... And the next day, and the one after that, for as long as I can.",9,0

Some reflections...,"I can't believe its been 4 weeks since I started thinking I might have a problem. Now I know I do (or did!?). That first Monday I spent the entire day watching TV instead of working, after a weekend of drinking that ended with me finishing an entire bottle of red wine by myself on the couch. That day I decided to stop drinking, and to do dry July (or what was left of it!).

Now I can not say I am the most productive person on the planet. But I have noticed improvements at work and on my personal life! Ive noticed I have a bit more energy, and less tendency to feel despair when I face a difficult task at work. I hope one day I will finally stop procrastinating, I think I am getting better at it.

I have also noticed what my triggers are and have learned to deal with them. I've discovered peach lemonade, sparkling water, and AF beer. I've realized I can also enjoy dinner without wine.

My sleep hasn't changed much, except that now there are more nights when I don't wake up several times.

I've mostly been reflecting on a lot of bad things that happened to me in my life, especially when I was younger, that I now know where a result of me putting myself in bad situations because of alcohol. Back then it was normal to drink, was expected for my age and I never realized it was not ""mandatory"". Now I look back and realize I lost control of a lot of things because I was drunk, I'm surprised I'm alive and nothing worse happened. I wish I could go back and protect my younger self and tell me not to go out partying or drinking so much. But the past is the past and I'm leaving it there. I'm now older and wiser, and sober! 

As these weeks have gone by I've now decided to keep it going and do dry August as well. 

I take it one day at the time and I am super thankful for this community,  thank you all who are always there with support and kind words to share. I'm really happy I can come here every day!

I‚Äôm grateful for all the nice words and affirmations. I do want to say though, I‚Äôm lucky and privileged to have been blessed with such an amazing support system of family and friends, and that this journey was much less difficult for me than I know it would have been and is for so many who do not have this in place. I don‚Äôt mean to say it has been a walk in the park; rather, I don‚Äôt feel I can take full credit for my success. My parents, my sister, my close friends and so many others have been a huge contribution to my achievement in this. 

I am not anti-alcohol, but I have realized that I, personally, am better without it. Some cool things I‚Äôd like to share that I‚Äôve noticed since quitting completely:

-My GERD is virtually gone.
-My clarity of thought, emotion stability, reliability and self esteem have seen dramatic improvements 
-I‚Äôve lost 30+ pounds just by stopping. Not implementing any kind of diet or exercise. Just cutting out the source of empty calories I was taking in.
-I can tolerate caffeine again, because my anxiety is so much more manageable now because I‚Äôm not depleting my ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù neurotransmitters all the time.

Things that I‚Äôm still working on are:
-Figuring out how to socialize and what my social life looks like without alcohol. Realizing how alcohol-centered so many of our social interactions are with one another has been eye opening.
-Using my extra time productively. I do often feel bored and/or boring, but to quote something I read, ‚ÄúWhat is more boring than having to stay in bed all day because you‚Äôre too hungover to do anything?‚Äù 

I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound preachy. I wanted to share my feelings to instill hope and encouragement in others who may be where I was a year ago.

This got really long, if anyone has the time to read my thoughts I do appreciate it. It is a lot of venting, so feel free to keep scrolling","I posted daily up to 12 days AF a couple months ago, but I have fallen off. Life has thrown me a lot of unexpected curveballs. I miss fighting for sobriety, but I find myself failing. A lot of stress has been added to my life, in such a way that I don't feel that I have the room to focus on sobriety like I was doing.

I apologize if this next part is inappropriate for this sub, I just started venting I guess. I will edit or delete if necessary.

My ex came back into my life after a 2-month separation (my kickstarter to sobriety was because of that breakup) the day he got into a motorcycle accident in front of me and almost died. That was early July. We're still navigating treatment as he has serious concussion symptoms and is basically unable to work. Initially, after the accident, we spent a few weeks figuring out if we were going to try and make this work again. We decided to. His health has deteriorated since then and I am doing my best to be supportive and help him navigate this traumatic experience.

But since then, I haven't been able to get a true handle on my sobriety. I'm still not drinking EVERY day, but it's becoming a few shots after work again more often than I'd like. But the thing is, when I'm not at work, my time is spent on not myself. It's on him, his needs, his medical needs outside of regular emotional needs, household needs, his daughter (my stepdaughter) and I love this child with all of my heart but she requires CONSTANT attention and he just plays video games for 10 hours a day and let's her do what she wants. What she wants is to be up my ass every second that I am home from work. And make huge messes while I'm at work and he's not paying attention, like clogging our sink with sand and throwing beads everywhere and painting on the walls and other things. He doesn't really discipline her, and this was a problem BEFORE the concussion but it's just so much worse now and I am trying so hard.

She has a large, loving support system but not enough individual attention between our households. I understand her acting out but I am getting increasingly frustrated with the absolute lack of parenting from him. She's starting school soon, which will be good for her I think.

I apologize from the depths of my soul if this sounds petty. I feel like I am being petty, and I don't like it. I'm about to share my petty thoughts for the day that led me, once again, to grab a couple of shots. I'm typing this before I drink them. Please don't judge me too harshly.

I wake up for work at 4 am. I work 48-56 hours every week. I have been paying most of the bills to the point where I am almost destitute. We are almost destitute.

Today, I used vacation time again to drive him to a doctor's appointment (that I had to schedule because he seems utterly uninterested in his own health and recovery), which took a couple hours, and then when we got home, he immediately fell asleep (which I know he needs for recovery, but he also makes the CHOICE to stare at a screen gaming, getting high, while having splitting headaches and blurred vision and then not be able to sleep until 6 am), and I spent a couple hours on the phone scheduling his next brain scans, while my stepdaughter pestered me, yelled at me, made messes, and just in general will not stop screaming my name and needing constant attention and telling me she hates me. 

I'm trying so hard to do everything I can, to make sure his health is being taken care of, to make sure the 5-year-old is taken care of... I spent hours yesterday dealing with her school enrollment paperwork, that he had organized over a week ago but just didn't scan the proper documents and go online to fill it all out officially, even though he told me he had it handled...  I spent a couple hours today AFTER getting off the phone with his insurance and MRI scan stuff just hanging out with her, making homemade popsicles, and I just asked for a couple minutes upstairs to cool off in the AC before walking our dog and she just came in and started screaming at me again and she's in time-out at this point, and I'm just staring at these shots now.

It's crazy to me that just 2 months ago, I was devastated but planning my life without them because of our breakup. I was facing myself and working on myself in a real way. I don't want life without them, I love them will all of my heart, but I am so stressed out by all of this that I can't focus on the main thing I need for my own success - sobriety.

I've been having migraines again for the first time in years. I am incredibly stressed out. I get maybe 5 hours of sleep, work 10-hour shifts starting at 5 am (except friday which is 8 hours), and have no energy to deal with anything for myself.

I was being really good about diet and going to the gym for about 6 weeks - but I haven't been able to go to the gym in 10 days because I've had 3 migraines in that time period.

I was journaling again, I've stopped that. I guess this is a kind of journaling.

I am exhausted mentally, emotionally, spiritually. And I've found myself going back to that quick relief, that slippery slope, and I know in my soul that I don't want to be that person again.

It's a lot all at once. I've been grabbing those after work shots nearly every day. Just to deal with my mental/emotional exhaustion, the demands placed upon me, and just the emotional gymnastics these last couple of months have been.

Thank you for reading if you did. I just needed to type this all out, I think. Life throws unexpected things at you. I just know I would be able to handle this better with a significant amount of sobriety under my belt. But I don't feel I have the chance or space to actually do that for myself, and it's bringing me down real hard.

Stay strong, all of you beautiful people. I will continue lurking (maybe posting again) because your success stories are all inspirational. Praying to the universe I will be with you one day <3",8,0

And then he gets really loud and in your face any normal person would of been terrified but I could see it, the confusion and how scared he was with his behaviour this is a ploy by my mother.

It's really unfair she's done this to us, she's won! I'm on my own ok!? Now just leave me alone I'm going through alot!!!

My brother has now too disowned me and the reason for this post is these events happened a little over 3 hours ago and well... I haven't stopped crying! I'm 31, I'm use to having my ass kicked by the universe daily, I'm use to being alone! Everytime I think I'm done I could literally say hello to a stranger and my voice cracks and the tears flood by! Why is this happening?? Why won't it stop!!

I need the universe to give my string of severely bad luck a tiny shred of a break! My names Christopher Lawis I live in South England and I'm honestly asking my brothers and sisters here to... I know its cheeky but include me in your prayers tonight! Just ask him to go easy on me a lil bit for like a week to get myself together as I'm having a huge breakdown involuntary of how I think or feel so I think I'm at that final point of being overwhelmed! If there was ever a time I'd ""slip up"" surely this would be it but it's nowhere near my process right now! I feel heart broken and hurt but 8 thought I was thicker skinned then this! My left eye lid is literally red! Lol! I love you all and thank you all so much for the support you've given me! As always and happily IWNDWYT <3 <3",9,0

We were almost done with the day when using a trimmer (weed eater) I flicked a rock into a sliding glass window and shattered it. I'm stupid, but not dumb so I finished up what I was doing and went and told my boss. Obviously he wasn't happy with it. I knew I fucked up, I owned it, and I'm proud of that, but regardless I was told that was essentially my last warning, if I fuck up again I'm gone. I'm hard worker and reliable and my boss recognizes that, but it's not my first mistake since I started in May and I've cost some money to his business.

  


Driving back to his house to get my car was a long damn ride, I feel terrible because I know I'm costing him money and putting him in a hard position. And that's when it hit, I just wanted to get fucked up. It wasn't even a thought to just drink a beer or something, I wanted to get completely blacked out and just not have to worry about it. I drove home in almost a daze because of that feeling.

  


I didn't go and get a drink, I'm not going to even, but I wanted to put it out there that the temptation was even there. For accountability and also to show that even after months of not ever being tempted, something goes slightly wrong and boom, the urge to drink is there.

I‚Äôm 16 days sober today- my longest streak since I started drinking in my senior year of high school. I just turned 32 this past weekend. My problem really developed in college, I went to a big football school and partying Thursday-Sunday was the norm. Or at least in my circle of friends it was. I‚Äôm a weekend binge drinker, and it is extremely difficult for me to just have one or two. Once I start its like I can‚Äôt turn off the switch. My hangovers have been unbearable in recent months, and I tend to make extremely poor decisions after a day or night of drinking. I‚Äôm so fortunate to have maintained a good job and have never gotten a DUI or anything along those lines. I know my only choice is to quit all together, and that moderation would not be possible for me, no matter how badly I wish it that is was.  

Anyways, I am going on a five day vacation to a resort/lodge in the Smokey mountains with my boyfriend next week, and I am nervous I will give in and drink. We typically binge drink together when we go out or go on trips like this. We went to the beach at the beginning of summer and I was either drunk or hungover the entire time. 

Can anyone offer advice or tips on how to fight the temptation during vacation? Or share success stories of vacations where drinking wasn‚Äôt involved? I don‚Äôt know what a vacation is like without alcohol. My cravings have been pretty bad recently and I just know the bar at the lodge and the ones in town will look so appealing. 

Thanks in advance, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be posting again when football season starts!

The title pretty much says it all.  I am currently changing careers (I've gone from museums/nonprofits to being an ESL teacher, and now making plans to start my own small business), I am happily married, although a DUI in early 2020 has put strain on our marriage, and wife and I have a bouncy 2 year old.  I am very happy with my home life, but I hate my job.  I currently work as a cashier at Lowes, and what started as an okay job has turned into a job I hate.  Upper management are okay, but seem clueless as to how to actually bring people into the store.  Lower management (our supervisors) don't care at all, have huge egos, and are often incompetent.  The store is also massively understaffed, so customers almost never receive help in the store, and the work culture is just bad.  I practice the Freedom Model to quit problem drinking [https://www.thefreedommodel.org/](https://www.thefreedommodel.org/), having started but never finished their book.  I also have done meditation off and on and want to get back into that.  I have fallen back into bad habits and started drinking during my shift on breaks to deal with the boredom and tedium of work (I work afternoon to closing shifts so that I can spend time with the toddler in the morning).  I worry that working this job has started me back down the bad path that got me to a DUI.  I do drink to drunkeness, but rationalize this because I am sober by the time I get home again.  Yes, I have been drinking behind my wife's back and I do feel bad about this.  My shifts end at 10:30, so the toddler is already sound asleep in bed by the time I get home.  I often just watch tv with wife until we both go to bed at around 12.  I do not want to see myself go farther down this path, but mindfulness has not seemed to help when you can't exactly meditate when dealing with a nasty customer or an incompetent supervisor.  I don't have any practical solutions or strategies to deal with this and would like some suggestions.  I have done the first few steps from the Freedom Model.  I no longer value drinking or want to do it.  I no longer see the partying I used to do years ago as something of value or something worth doing.  I no longer like drinking.  I feel like I am only doing it to get through a shift.  I would like to be sober for many reasons, but particularly to have greater integrity, to not be hiding anything from my wife, to be able to wake up early so that I actually have time to enjoy my mornings before the toddler wakes up, doing healthy things like yoga, reading a good book, or even doing some MOOC classes.

Even on comic con i went to i had 2 bottles on top of many shots; wild. Anyway i quit dancing in 2019 to get away from the party life but unfortunately i was a bartender and began drinking 3-5 drinks a day with more on the weekend and lots of coke from a friend of mine, around march 2020 when i got laid off i decided to quit drinking since I was at home due to covid so i said why not. Well it was going great and i was feeling much better, healthier and happier than ive been for many years and i also quit coke, those 73 days were beautiful until my brother was killed in front of me and i drunk so much that night and the day afterwards i was throwing up blood, they told me my pancreas levels were elevated but they weren't concerned because i drunk alot that day and previous night. I stopped drinking again but slowly began drinking 1-2 drinks every other day than in October i had a horrible cramps after eating a meatball sub. Found it was gastritis however my lipase was 190, the doctor explained that i was halfway from getting acute pancreatitis so i went on a low fat diet of only 35 grams of fat pre day and tried to stop drinking however i would drink every 2 weeks while hanging out with my than FWB. The last time i got my lipase levels were only 100 and in the normal range but every since i have been drinking again almost 2-3 drinks a day and some times heavier if i go to parties.

I'm down 8 lbs (I know it's probably just flushing out my swollen liver or something but it's still encouraging).  When I was drinking I was rarely able to eat more than a few bites of anything at a time, and forget about eating in the morning and keeping it down - I ate an entire plate of eggs benedict with hash browns the other day!  

It feels SO good to be able to wake up without the shakes, talk to people without blasting them with vodka breath and it seeping out my pores, knowing that if I were to drive and get pulled over I'd blow a 0.00.  

The best and most surprising part is that I have zero desire to drink.  I still have 2 bottles of wine, a bottle of champagne, half a box of Franzia (the big one), 2 handles of vodka, and 3 crowlers of my favorite specialty beer.  They're all just sitting there in the middle of the kitchen, and I don't even think about them - I plan on giving the wine/champagne and beer away to friends.  I went to the liquor store to ask if I could return the two handles (they're unopened obviously) and he said no.  That was a little disappointing because I want my $26 back, but oh well.  While I was there I asked if they had anything non-alcoholic and he said no, so I really have no need to go in there at all anymore.

It is such a relief to be free of this weight that's been holding me down for years.  I saw a post the other day that said ""sobriety isn't that I don't GET to drink, it's that I don't HAVE to drink.""  I loved that and it really resonated with me.

I chose not give in to the temptation or the idea of drinking, I didn't get blackout drunk and wake up with a nasty hangover that would have put me in a sour mood all day.. so with that being said,

Sober for 8 months now. The past 8 months have been the best of my life so I have a lot of motivation to not pick up and drink again.

However, sometimes I do feel lonely. I think I am a likeable person, and people do seem to gravitate towards me sometimes, but sometimes I feel like I have a lot of emotion and feelings that are hard to express and that I don't really know anyone to share these feelings with. I feel like no one else has them, and I have a lot in my past that I carry around with me. The depression, loneliness, traumatic stuff like getting sexually assaulted, bullied and beaten up, roommates dying of overdoses,  etc. (I am a 28 y/o man)

I feel like I carry it around but I can't tell anyone about it, not because I can't, but that other people may not understand.

I've told myself for nearly a year but never anyone else. Well, last night for the first time in I don't  know how long, I didn't drink 2 bottles of wine. In fact, I didn't even drink 1! Yes, I had about 3 glasses but I was much more mindful about each sip. Usually I can down a bottle in 2 -3 hours but 3 glasses took 5. I even managed to have a bath, which is a rarity because I'm either too tired or tipsy - don't get me wrong, I do shower lol - but it was lovely to use some luxury products, lay back and relax whilst watching tv on my tablet. I went to bed feeing totally sober but I didn't sleep much though, to be expected and I'm tired today but I'm happy to be tired through sober insomnia than feeling wiped from alcohol induced sleep and the shakes! I even got up and put make up on this morning which I haven't done for ages. My question is, any tips or tricks to hold onto this good feeling so that when the inevitable 'I'll be fine' feeling kicks in later I can ride it out? I haven't made myself a promise not to drink ever again but I am fully committed to reigning it right back with the intention of eventually having 3 or 4 alcohol free days in  the week and not bingeing on the other days.

While scrolling through another app, I heard someone say that, ""The best sleep is sober sleep."" After waking up hungover today, those words 100% hit home. 

After being on this sub tonight, and seeing people post about their labs being off, or worse, I got my labs out from the last time I went to the MD. Except for my sugar and triglycerides being high, everything else in the CMP (comprehensive metabolic pannel) is normal except one blood value (MCV) which is slightly elevated (4pts from normal). I looked up what would cause that, and wouldn't you know that one of the causes is heavy drinking. I know my high triglycerides are also most likely due to drinking, as well as high blood sugar. I consider myself lucky that's all that is abnormal in my labs. 

I have a big test coming up this weekend in the form of a concert I am going to (fully vaxed). Normally, that would mean beer o'clock from the time I get there to last call. I know I can, and will, attend this concert sober.  It will be the first concert/event that I have attended sober since I turned 21 many moons ago. 

And the next day, I will feel f'ing fantastic because I won't be hungover and I will actually remember the concert, for once!

\*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning, SD! Our wonderful DCI community has shared some fantastic suggestions on establishing healthy routines this week. But how do you turn good intentions into a permanent change of habit?

My life is littered with the debris of abandoned resolutions and it can bruise my self-esteem, what with dodging the dusty yoga mat and avoiding the abandoned bicycle. Recently I‚Äôve been reading about the Intention-Behavior gap, which is just the difference between what people say they are going to do (intention), and what they actually do (behavior). Every evening I go to sleep with the intention of getting up as soon as the morning alarm goes off, but when the gentle chiming starts at 5:45am, I hit snooze. Why? Who is running this show anyway??? I‚Äôm not alone in my flakiness - research suggests that only 50% of intentions get converted into action. Here are a few suggestions I‚Äôve found from behavioral scientists researching the Intention-Behavior gap that might help:

1. Set a realistic, clear, and firm intention

¬∑ Look at the Daily Check In 24-hour pledge above for a great example of a well-worded intention. For my snooze issue, I might say ‚ÄúI commit to getting up and making the bed as soon as the alarm goes off every day for the rest of this week‚Äù.

2. Remember to act

¬∑ A lot of good intentions fail because we just forget about them after a while or get distracted by other things. Oops, I was meant to be getting up, yet here I am messing about on Reddit! Tracking how you are doing helps you stay the course and adapt where needed, like checking your sober counter, or marking your wins on a calendar.

3. Prepare contingency plans

¬∑ Life happens but having if/then contingency plans decided up front means you need to rely less on limited willpower stores in the heat of the moment when something crops up. **If** I‚Äôm struggling to sleep, **then** I will try a guided meditation. **If** my workmates ask me to go with them to the pub at lunch, **then** I will‚Ä¶.?

If you‚Äôd like to share, what do you do to turn your intentions into reality?

3119,2021-08-10 01:32:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p1ixvv/help_me_come_clean_to_my_girlfriend/,Help me come clean to my girlfriend.,"My girlfriend is a wonderful woman that I met online playing video games online. Prior to this, I was sober for about 2 years. During the time I got to know her I was sober, and throughout the months before I moved I started to drink more and more due to peer pressure (as well as my inability to maintain self-control). So, here I am living with my girlfriend. We've been together for about seven months, and in that time I've been drinking more and more. When she sleeps I drink as much as posssible.  


it's also important to note that I'm on 20mg escitalopram (Lexapro) and during these times I've blamed my sadness/depression/anxiety on the increased dosage. I'm scared to face her, and tell her that I've fallen back into my old ways of alcoholism. I hate waking up early for work, and I view the option of death so much more appealing, yet I love her so much that I would never do that to her. I feel that alcohol is making me feel this severe depression, but I'm too scared to confide in her for fear of her leaving me. (I'm quite drunk right now),   


I don't know what to do. I've been able to identify that alcohol is a problem for me (AA is not my scene), and I've been able to quit in the past, but right now I feel so tied together with it that I'm having trouble not only quitting, but I feel so guilty lying to my girlfriend.  


If possible I'd like some people who have had similar experiences to comment and advise me. I'm very lost and scared on where to go from now.  My depressed brain is telling me to make her my beneficiary, and go so far off the deep end that nothing else would matter, but that's selfish, and could only hurt her.",4,0

I had a year and then I tried to drink in moderation.  We all know how that works.  Went really heavy for over a year and last Sunday I made a decision to be better.  I‚Äôm doing pretty good and for some reason I haven‚Äôt really been feeling the urge to drink.  I‚Äôve had small things like beer commercials or a buddy asking if I wanted to grab a drink, but nothing like last time.  I just try and remind my self that I will talk my self into another drink if I open that door. I hope this keeps up.  

  It‚Äôs just been 8 days but I already am starting to feel like myself again.  I‚Äôm waking up early and working with my pup.  He‚Äôs becoming an incredible dog and if I keep it up we will be in a duck blind together later this year.  I went through the house and threw away bags full of old clothes and clutter I held onto because I was to drunk to give a shit.  I had old boxers from like 8 years ago and old pants and shirts from 30 lbs ago.  Went to my gym I‚Äôve been paying for over a year and a half but only been twice up till now.  Detailed my truck and sold the other that‚Äôs been parked and neglected.  I‚Äôm getting shit done and it feels good.  I know it‚Äôs because of my clear head.  

   I‚Äôve been making it a point to get out of the house and into nature anytime I start to feel bored or idle.  After that I‚Äôve just been at home and throwing things away or cleaning. It‚Äôs really insane the amount of useless rubbish a drunk can collect.  Not like hoarder status, but just a sheer amount of needles stuff.  Projects everywhere that I got drunk and started but got drunk the next day and forgot about when I started the new project.  Multiply that by years.  It‚Äôs also insane the amount of money I‚Äôve saved just in a week.  Every night I was spending $30 on drink, $10 on smokes, and probably $20 for what ever fast food bullshit I was eating when I did eat.  Throw in the miscellaneous impulse internet shopping I‚Äôd do for the thing I needed to make me happy that night.  I‚Äôm probably up 3-400 dollars this week.  I‚Äôve also only smoked 3 times throughout the week.  It‚Äôs a real eye opener.  This rant is more for myself to look back on and reflect when the inevitable hard times come.  Don‚Äôt forget man.

I‚Äôm trying to stay humble, striving for humility, and working on checking my ego. I‚Äôm ‚Äúgraduated‚Äù to phase two of the IOP I‚Äôm in and still going to four AA meetings a week. That‚Äôs the plan for the foreseeable future. AA very likely has a place in my life forever.

I'm just wrapping up reading of the lengthy and fascinating Alexander the Great bio by Peter Green. I mentioned last week that he wasn't much of a drinker. He does become a very heavy drinker when he gets a bit older and Green mentions several times that the drinking very much went hand in hand with his descent into tyranny and megalomania. Someone asked last week ""didn't he kill his best friend in a drunken rage?"" and I said I hadn't gotten to it yet if he did. Well it was not his best friend, but it was one of his oldest and most trusted officers, who had made the mistake of suggesting that Alexander's father, Philip (who he'd also served under) was as good a commander as Alexander during some drunken teasing that was happening at one of Alexander's by-then-nightly parties. Alexander's drunken fragile ego couldn't take it and he speared him right at the table. This is regarded by most historians as the turning point in his temperament and his career. We could never know how his life would have turned out had he not become an alcoholic, but he did, and all his greatness went down hill. His death followed his slamming a huge cup of unmixed wine, which may have been poisoned. He was already drunk when he drank it so would have been off guard. Green describes him as firmly in the grip of late stage alcoholism by then. And he was only 32 years old.

But that didn't stop me. The guilt/shame of becoming dependent on my dad again, after just having moved out for the year. The guilt and shame I still see in his eyes today, because he's just given up. Neither stopped me. 

The fights with my brother and him because I'd steal from them to get my fix and rid myself of the shakes and crippling anxiety. The fear of consequences didn't stop me. Shit, my life is ruled by fear and anxiety these days. I hate leaving the house or going too far or doing anything unfamiliar.

Tired of being the poor influence on my family. See, they can justify (irrationally, but you know) their drinking intake because I can handle entirely too much liquor and still walk around functioning. 

Tolerance way too high after drinking basically the same cheap vodka every day for the last 3 or so years. No one should be able to go through 3 handles of that shit in a week, with the biggest symptom of a hangover being a zombie and needing more sleep. I'll admit I'm probably fortunate that I'm still young and hadn't been ultra super mega heavy drinking for as long as some stories I've read.

But here's the deal. We're going broke. My dad's health is questionable and he's missing work, adding to being broke. The stress of being broke is adding to his health issues. 

And now my brother is drinking like a fish, and I'm worried about him because I see the same ""nah, I'm young and I have control."" No, lil dude. I wish I could tell him that, but I'd be lying. He's already drinking straight liquor daily and using it as a crutch for girl problems. In fact, had it not been for a Christmas gift from my friends a few years ago, I couldn't have breathalyzed him to prevent him from driving to work the next morning, still drunk. He's only had his license a couple years (he's legal age to drink, he just had no desire to get a license til he had a car), and not very confident behind the wheel. 

That same night, I had to wrangle my drunk dad into bed because he was stumbling, slurring, and missed the toilet when he went to take a leak. And I did it all after about a fifth of 80 proof poison.

Those events were just a week ago. Everything seems to be coming to a head, and it seems to be up to me to take the first step towards the better life I had dreamed of, long before I realized I'd been taken by this disease.

TL;DR Five years ago I was seeing a therapist, and upon learning I had been fired from my job due to drinking, I was placed in an IOP for recovery. And I was stubborn and didn't take it seriously and felt like I was the victim. But it was there that the group leader said that to me. 

""You're the Trailblazer of your family."" 

I didn't get it then. But I get it now.

Thank you, Jeanette.",11,0

I think if I could get a few weeks momentum under my belt, it would help a lot, but getting over the first ‚Äúhump‚Äù always just destroys me. Anyone have any tips/advice? The country I live in has no community support groups, and I‚Äôm not much of a people person, so I‚Äôm pretty much on my own. I will be starting a new online course at the end of the month in addition to my 50-60 hour a week job, so I‚Äôm hoping that I‚Äôll just be too busy to drink.

Just checking in for the first time since just leaving inpatient. Hit 90 days and feel fucking amazing. All the time. Even when I'm just sitting around doing menial tasks, I just feel good! As clich√© as it sounds, I totally understand the feeling when now when people would say that their worst day sober is better than their best day drinking. 

I shared my achievement with my sober friends, my family, my coworkers, everyone I could think to tell :)

Just wanted to gush about it some more and I knew this was the place to do it! 

I  feel like I get to re-experience everything from the last 7 years or so and the opportunity to do so is soooo appreciated and not lost on me! There's still so much I want to work on, but with a clearer head,  I feel so much more capable and less like I'm in a constant personal growth deficit if that makes any sense. 

Please share this moment with me those of you here who are further along in their recovery! And to those of you who aren't as far along, keep going! 

One last thing: Someone DM'd me after my post-treatment post and I shared a bit more of my experience with them as they were thinking of starting the journey themselves.

I write this sober, as I have been since April 16th. Since that date not a lot has happened and that‚Äôs not always bad. 

The most exciting thing is that I no longer get butterflies when I go to a gas station or grocery store and walk past the alcohol section. 

I‚Äôve managed to go on dates and stay sober. 

I‚Äôve had friends and family over and stay sober for that. 

My family resents me deciding to quit drinking not because they drink a ton, but because it leads them to believe it‚Äôs a problem. I‚Äôve never told them I had a problem but me quitting and turning down beer gets them worried. I just say it‚Äôs for my health and it‚Äôs my choice. 

I dump out any beer, wine, or liquor left at my home from family and friends. They all know now that it‚Äôs BYOB and Take Your Own Beer when they leave. 

My health has increased and I‚Äôm down 31 pounds. I finally have my old belt buckle notch back again. 

I‚Äôve come to the realization that sometimes these supreme posts about miraculous recovery and life about-faces are not always a result from stopping alcohol. While beautiful and encouraging, they are the motivation for some to quit but not the reality most of us face. The reality I‚Äôve faced is that I‚Äôve returned to normalcy. I can go home and do what I want without having to worry about if I have enough beer in the fridge. I can leave anytime I want because I know I‚Äôm sober. 

I‚Äôm no longer a prisoner to a bottle or can. I‚Äôm my own normal person with my incredibly average life and I‚Äôm damn proud to have made a return to normalcy. 

I write a post from time to time not to ask for pats on the back or words of affirmation. I write them because I have nobody else to air this out to and I know that one person out here will read this and go, ‚Äúwow, FormerStuff is now a former alcoholic. Good for them‚Äù.

I started off trying to drink La Croix and other seltzer‚Äôs but they just didn‚Äôt do it for me. Then recently I came across an old trick of drinking soda water with bitters. It‚Äôs the perfect drink to give me that feeling like I am enjoying a nice drink. And if you are a cocktail drinker like me, you probably have some bitters lying around somewhere.

Keep in mind, some types and brands of bitters contain alcohol in them. The one I use does have alcohol in it but I only add 4 dashes to 12 oz‚Äôs of water so I don‚Äôt count it as drinking but you might, so just be mindful.",25,0

WARNING TO ALL DRINKERS.","I was a functional alcoholic for about 7 years...but don't be fooled, I could really drink!  Late 40's female, wife, mother and working.

Stayed sober for 14 years. However, deep down I knew I was going to drink again. I'd look at drinkers with envy and knew I wasn't really free of alcohol. Finally retired 4 years ago. Found myself very bored. I was sure I could moderate my drinking since I had totally abstained for so long. This lasted about 3-4 months when I found myself as bad off..if not worse than before. Went to inpatient for a spell (couldn't wait to get home and start drinking again). Then outpatient off and on for a year. Then Covid hit. I had no support and once again I was doing a fantastic job of hiding the drinking. Finally, one morning...almost exactly 1 year ago, it was 10am and I was on the couch, drunk,  super depressed and physically a wreck. I came to the brilliant conclusion that it doesn't have to be this way. I gave up drinking, began exercising and eating well. I decided I wanted to enter my ""senior years"" in good health. I no longer have any urge to drink and look at alcohol as poison. It doesn't bother me if someone else is drinking. I want no part of it. I really learned my lesson.

Plan your night out, and picture yourself going home proud and think about all the things you won't be ashamed of the next day. Remind yourself how good it will feel to wake up sober and not hungover, 
Tell your self ""you will be home in bed tonight, not doing something that you'll feel embarrassed about tomorrow, no shame, no regrets or fights"".

The alcohol would either numb the pain, loneliness, or whatever I was feeling, or it would be enough to act as a kind of 'mental block' or 'limiter' for my brain, where it would just shut my mind down and stop it from being able to think about things for a while. Eventually it would also help by sending me to sleep. Just over a couple of months ago I had a mental breakdown, drank heavily to try and cope with it, and the short version is the state I was in ended up costing me the friendship of my closest friend, the most important person in my life. Since then I forced myself to quit, partially because I of how drinking had ended up in me emotionally hurting someone I care deeply about, and partially as a way for me to try and change, hoping it might help toward redemption and a chance at earning back my friends forgiveness and friendship. 

I successfully managed to cut off cold (a horrid week of withdrawals), and have managed to stay off ever since. However it's all feeling in vain and I'm losing hope, it seems the change is too little too late, and the thought and worry that I can't ever save or repair the friendship is adding more and more to my depression. Each day I'm struggling more and more to cope with my thoughts and pain, without drinking I no longer have any 'block/limiter' to numb my pain or stop my thoughts. The whole day my mind is full of thoughts over what happened, regret, pain of loss, worry over what will happen, and in the last few weeks suicidal thoughts (not immeditate, but a feeling that it's only a matter of time if I can't save the friendship). It feels like my mind is under a constant migrane being crushed with all thoughts constantly swirling around in there at the same time. Sometimes I can barely walk or stand as it just overwhelms my head and I can't function, a few times I've ended up dropping to my knees. At work I've had to go out back as I've just mentally frozen or broken down, and when getting back home I've just collapsed on the bed not able to move as the thoughts get too much. I've barely been able to sleep, the thoughts constantly keeping me awake or waking me up in the form of nightmares over what happened.

I'm starting to think that if stopping drinking wasn't enough of a change and it's never going to help me earn back that friendship then what the hell is the point? Why don't I just drown my sorrows away to at least stop the pain and depression I've been suffering? But then I remember I stopped it because it contriubted to the state I was in that night when I emotionally hurt my friend, and that thought keeps me off of it. I'm doing it for her, even if she never realises it or even cares about it. I just don't know what else to use instead of alcohol, I need something to stop my thoughts, numb me, and shut down my mind, I'm going insane and I don't think I can keeping going on for much longer. I've tried forcing myself with distractions, TV, games etc, but I can't get into anything anymore (a lot reminds me of my friend which is why), I've tried herbal teas, legal botanical narcotics (smoking blue lotus etc), natural & OTC aids (Kalms etc), anti-depressants (perscribed), I'm in therapy, I've tried crisis lines / online support, and none of it is helping, I continue to get worse each day. The only thing I've found that's helpful have been some strong sleeping tablets, however I can't use them everyday as I get resistant to them, so I only end up able to use them for about 1-2 nights per week. I just have no idea what to do or how to cope, there doesn't seem to be anything that works in the way alcohol did. I'm so tempted to turn back to it, more so each day, but I can't, I feel I still owe it to my friend to stay off of it.",9,0

When I left the army I drank even more and did less excercise. Now I have an enlarged fatty liver, gained 60 lbs and my marriage is tense.

I tried cutting back for a while and it escalated to the point last week I drank almost the entire week, resulting in some bad fights with my family. 

Felt like shit yesterday. Just guilty anxious and depressed. I finally feel like something has changed. The wool has been lifted. 

I've realized that i spend way too much on alcohol, both money and time. I was delusional and thought we must be bleeding money somewhere else. It couldn't be my drinking. I got hormones tested because drinking couldn't be the cause of my weight gain and lethargy. I looked into medication because weekly binges couldn't be causing my emotional breakdowns. 

Well now I see the truth. The sneaky bastard had me believing he was my friend and helped me relax, when in reality, it was him that was the cause of most of the problems in my life.

I've never been honest with anyone about my drinking, especially not myself. I'm hoping that posting all this will help keep me focused and keep the delusional fog away.

Last week my wife left me, for one of my closest friends and I‚Äôm utterly destroyed. A lot of it was due to alcohol and all of the problems that surround it. Until today I basically spent every waking moment absolutely smashed. This morning I woke up on my dads couch and went to pour a drink, and looked at the time. It was 730am. I had a little bit of a come to Jesus break down and poured it down the sink and searched for AA meetings. I went to one earlier today and couldn‚Äôt even make it through my first sentence before I had to get up and leave because I could tell I was going to be way too open and start crying in front of everyone. 


I‚Äôve been a problem drinker for many years, but I never had any negative consequences from it, I think this may be the rock bottom I always heard about and judged people thinking ‚ÄúThat would never happen to me‚Äù. I‚Äôm just not sure where to go from here. I‚Äôve tried AA a couple times before and it didn‚Äôt take at all, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in a mental space to share in person yet. I‚Äôve tried to find a therapist and met with one 3 times before I gave up at him kind of being a moron. 


A couple other things that I‚Äôm using as excuses, I had a failed back surgery 2 years ago and I‚Äôm in constant pain. Some days I can‚Äôt even stand up straight until I‚Äôm 6-7 mixed drinks in. 

My friends have been trying to cheer me up and keep me busy, but the only activities we do are all drinking based. So I‚Äôm looking at giving up drinking versus sitting at my dads while I find somewhere else to live  and torturing myself in my head.

The overall ""fun"" of drinking is not actually fun at all.  You get a rush for like 20 mins then you just consume empty calories and make an ass out of yourself.  I know Im there because 4 years ago I quit smoking and felt very similar.  

If its your 1st or 1001st day, Im with it today.  Lets get it",12,0

I woke up feeling more ashamed and gross and horrible than I ever had after a night of drinking. I also started a new antidepressant and was told that abusing substances makes it harder to tell if the medication is working or not (makes sense, especially for depression meds.) I decided I was going to use that awful feeling as a motivator to quit. Anytime I felt craving I would remind myself of that place and how I felt and that I never wanted to go through that ever again. Even if there was only a small chance of it happening, it wasn't worth it. I lasted a week. Seven days before I totally forgot that feeling and was able to convince myself that it wasn't that bad and even if it was, it'd be worth going through again if I got to drink just one more night. It's always like this. I'm so determined and I get rid of everything in my house that has to do with alcohol or anything that could trigger me. I change my routine and even avoid the room in my house where I go to drink and I feel good, I get through day 5 which is always the hardest, and I feel good about it, and then I convince myself sobriety isn't worth it and isn't fun and I'd rather be drunk. Over and over again. And I know it's wrong! And I know I'll regret it!

I forgot how once you get into double digits the day count goes from resistance (ugh, day one, never gonna make this happen) to support (I AM NOT MESSING UP, I HAVE TWO WEEKS!), and I'm pleased to be back in this moment where I want to stake out boundaries and defend my sobriety, even if the convo I have to have to do so is difficult. 

I need to be honest with my wife about how I'm doing with Alcohol, and what I need from her, and am terrified about having this conversation due to my own Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria and the general fear that any conversation about alcohol is going to be taken as a value judgement on her because this is a trick alcohol plays on all of us. But I'm not criticizing her, I'm criticizing alcohol, which is a harmful behavior altering addictive substance. She is not the one unique person who alcohol doesn't have these effects upon. 

I relapsed in June / July pretty heavily during some incredibly stressful work stuff, and I hid this drinking from her. I need to come clean about this because without doing that, I'm always going to be hiding *something* and she's not going to know the depth of the struggle I'm in. There's two major aspects of my alcohol related anxiety: 1) the macro, long term danger 2) the day to day hyper vigilance. I haven't brought this up yet out of guilt and shame, but I'm ready to. 

I have anxiety about the long term health effects of alcohol. It's one of the main reasons I'm trying to be alcohol free. The issue is that her steady, regular drinking has caused that anxiety to be transferred to her. Instead of worrying about my own health I'm worried about hers. She's my wife after all, and I'm worried about her well-being, both physically and mentally.

My wife struggles with depression and anxiety and is thinking about increasing her prozac dosage. This is alarming to me because it's completely ignoring the fact that she's drinking a depressant every night which lowering her mood's ""floor,"" and could be contraindicating the prozac. So to increase the anti-depressant without addressing the depressant seems... misguided and to be honest it scares me. 

I don't want to make any ultimatums because as we all know, lasting things happen internally. All I can do is tell her my perspective and how it's affecting me. 

Her drinking really only bothers me when it's in our house, as part of the regular night to night fabric of our life together. The issue is that's every night. There are no nights off at home, and when we go out, she drinks as well (but this bothers me less). So I have no nights where my wife is joining me in the act of ""not drinking,"" and that makes me feel isolated and alone.  

Alcohol bothers me in the house because, due to my own struggles, it's something I have to be on guard against, my therapist used the word ""hyper vigilance"" and ""fight or flight,"" and to be dealing with that in my own home, every night, is very taxing. I have to expend a lot of energy to deal with that. 

It also becomes hard for me to connect due to the hypervigiliant state I'm in, and it's not ideal for me to be hanging out with someone who gets buzzed every night. If there's something serious I want to bring up, or if I need support to stay alcohol free, I hesitate to do that when she's had drinks.

I think about the phrase of the subreddit, ‚ÄúI will Not Drink With You Tonight,‚Äù I read it as ""I will *NOT DRINK* with you tonight,"" in that ""not drinking"" is an active state, an activity in itself, and I need that support from my wife. I need her to *not drink* *with* me. 

She went on vacation recently and while I was lonely, I was also able to relax much more fully because there was no alcohol in the house while she was gone. Out of Sight, Out of Mind, is incredibly real and powerful for me. If I was allergic to cats, or peanuts, we wouldn‚Äôt get a smaller cat, or have a cat every other day, or PBJ only on weekends. We just wouldn't get a cat, or eat PBJ. Ideally there would be no alcohol in the house. 

I don't want to bring this up to make her feel bad, even though that might happen. She's been noticing moments when I'm struggling with the fight or flight response, noticing when I reposition on the couch so I'm farther away from her wine so I don't have to smell the wine. Asking what's wrong and I deflect. So it's having effects and I feel like I need to bring it up. 

I need something to change, and I don't want to police her drinking because that plays into the hyper vigilance and makes me a villain whose taking something away from her.

I want her to see how much I'm hurting and want her to help and support me because she loves me. She's asked me repeatedly ""How do we get Carefree Mo back"" and I need to tell her. 

All advice/support is welcome. I specifically don't want to make any ultimatums because that kinda thing is doomed to fail in my experience, but I have to tell her, in a fair manner, where I am at and how her relationship with alcohol is affecting me. And I'm terrified of doing this.",5,0

My son story begins like so many I've read here. I started partying in college, back then it was cute to be the drunkest girl at the party

Then i started drinking beer every day after work-- because you know-- i earned it.

I ignored my childhood trauma, got into an abusive relationships with a violent drunk.
I finally had the courage to leave, i moved to a new city and fell in with a broken group of people. We were all in the midst of chaos so we trauma bonded over-- you guessed it-- alcohol.

But after a while it got calm. I met a wonderful human being and i slowed my roll. I even had sober weeks, months even. I didn't think i had a problem.

But all of the trauma on the back burner caught up with me. And my old friend booze was back. I ruined a four year relationship and broke the most tender heart i ever got to hold.

Then my family had a life changing emergency, followed shortly by Covid. I lost the business I had started and decided to grab my cat-- the only thing i cared about anymore-- and move back across the ocean.

The anxiety was constant and the only thing that seemed to make me not think about the void and also help me sleep was booze. 

I had been working on getting my shit together and get out of the situation i was living in (that's a long story-- this post is already way longer than i intended)

Well I got a job in the city I'd wanted to live in. But it is extremely difficult to find housing here-- and i struggle with the bureaucracy in this country. My cat, my only comfort is still with my family 600 km away.

After Not interacting with humans for a year and a half-- i am completely socially drained. Being in a new city alone is so lonely. 

But i can't fight my demons with demons anymore.

Today is day one. I got a massage and went to a cafe that doesn't serve booze (so i wouldn't be tempted) by myself.

I bought some herbal tea and sleep supplements. It's a long journey, but i believe in myself this time.

If you read all of this, thank you. I think i just needed to write it down somewhere",15,1

I called in sick today, not because of the hangover (I've learned to work through those), but because I need a mental health day. I drank too much last night and did something stupid. Now I'm feeling very guilty, depressed, and like a failure. 

I am seeing a Dr. today to discuss options for me. I don't drink enough to need to detox, but I'm 28 and haven't been sober more than 2 weeks since I was 21. I don't know how to have fun, feel confident, or enjoy much without alcohol. I usually drink about 6-10 beers 4 or 5 nights a week. I know that's not a staggering amount, but it has taken it's toll on my body and mental health. 

I'm scared. I don't know how to ask for help and I'm nervous about having that conversation - even with a physician. I'm scared that my friends won't enjoy spending time me anymore. I'm scared that gaming nights with my brother won't be as fun. I'm scared that camping with my friends won't be the same by not partaking in the bottle being passed around the campfire. I'm scared that everything won't be as exciting. I almost feel as if I'm not ready to it up just yet.

But I want to experience the enjoyment of these things without it. I see other people living life happily sober. I've always had a crutch. The time in my 20's that I drank the least was when I had a nasty kratom habit. Now more than ever, I want to go back to it to replace alcohol. 

I want to remember what it's like to feel confident and energetic without a buzz. I want to be fit and feel good about my body. I don't want to dread about going to work hungover the next day. I want to have a healthy sex life. I feel as if my sexual fantasies are getting wilder and bolder the more I drink. Sex feels less about the intimacy and connection, and more about satisfying those kinks. Pornography is easy for me to resist sober. Drunk me doesn't care and will go on a binge and wake up the next day feeling gross. 

I also want to kick my nicotine habit and quit vaping, but that's a battle that might have to wait until I get this under control.

Addiction, dependency, whatever you want to call it, is difficult to undue after years of bad habits. But my God, it is frustrating to look back and see how preventable it is. 

I'm well passed the ""drink responsibly"" stage. One or two drinks just doesn't sound appealing to me.

The first time I got drunk was when I was 12 with my best friend. From my 20s to my mid 50s I probably got drunk 3-4 times in a year. I got drunk on camping trips or vacations. When I was home, I would typically only drink on the weekends. I was working and doing my best to be a good husband and dad to my 4 kids. 

I semi-retired 6 years ago and that is when my drinking increased substantially. I've changed from a person who could have 2-3 drinks to someone who cannot stop. In the last 12 months I've probably got drunk 50 times which is a dramatic increase. I don't know why this happened. It seems to run in my family - my mom almost never drank until she was in her 60s and then she became a binge drinker. I'd love to have a few drinks socially, but that does not appear to be an option for me.

I'm writing this because there are probably a lot of people in my shoes. They drank responsibly for years and then something changed and they went off the rails.

Stopped drinking on Thursday morning of last week, so a solid 4 days in, after a Wednesday night bender with friends, I felt like such utter crap on Thursday morning that I decided that I was going to take a very long break and focus on my health and unfinished projects.

Day 2 (Saturday) and 3 (Sunday) were remarkably productive, I got so much work done, more than I could have if I had been casually drinking beers like I usually would have. I felt amazing and had huge hope and motivation for the future.

Day 4 (today), I hit a wall of anxiety, slept like crap the night before, woke up a few times, especially at 3:00 (just like if it were a drinking night), and had this crazy anxiety. I feel overwhelmed with everything that needs to be done at home, so much so I just feel like locking the doors and just driving to a different state and starting over (not going to do that, but you get the idea).

Were my first 2 days the ""pink cloud"" that I keep hearing about? Did it wear off already?  
I just want this anxiety to go away, the anxiety is something fairly new to me, I never had anxiety up until about a few years ago after a traumatizing event in my life (lost a relationship with my best friend), but now, any unfinished project, messy room, dirty dishes, and major things like a bathroom remodel, just throws me for a loop until I can muster enough energy to get it done.

It seems like sobriety for me would mean isolating myself but the urge to drink when I'm lonely is so strong. I wish I could meet some sober friends who can show me the way of socializing and having fun without a beer in my hand. I hate how normalized drinking is in our society. I can't seem to think of a single activity I could do with friends that wouldn't eventually end up with drinking!

I was so deep in a rut that I had furnished it. I was resigned to having a shitty life.  Maybe even thought it was what I 'deserved' on some level.

I hated it, but it gave me more reasons to drink. And dig the rut deeper.

I wish I could say that stopping drinking magically transported me to a better life.  It improved some things, but the rut was still there.

It took time, and working on the core issues - the short version is a self esteem that had been warped, cracked and stretched too thin by fear and anger.  

For me the rut was impossible to escape so long as I was still drinking.  Period.  Drinking was a self medication of symptoms rather than the root cause - also drinking, and the things it gave me license to do, gave me good reasons to have low self esteem.

Once I was sober for a bit and began to realize that my life was not going to get better by itself.  The promotion at work, the toxic marriage, the view of the world as seen from under a rock were not going to change just because I did not have a hangover and a few dollars in my pocket.

And yes, on some levels, I was afraid of moving on.  Moving forward, moving up.  I don't think I knew how.

I used the tools provided in AA (there are many alternatives, try one try em all) and they worked something to my surprise because I had all the issues (agnostic and my middle name is 'don't tell me what to do')  

It took time. It took taking risks.  It took putting myself out there to other people in ways I was not comfortable with.  But I am here to tell you that it was worth it.

I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I am in the right place, but maybe I could use some advice. I have been drinking nearly every day for the last 2 years because I can‚Äôt really live with my feelings when I am sober.

My problem is that I am still continuing to do my life shit quite well even though so much of the time I am drunk. I am studying full time and getting incredibly good marks. I also work and am able to do my job well and get up at 5.30am to go to work. This makes it hard to have motivation to stop because I can justify to myself that it isn‚Äôt really a problem.

Every time I try to stop it might last for 1-2 weeks and I think it‚Äôs done but I just go right back to where I was before. And it‚Äôs not like all of the time. I don‚Äôt drink before/at work but afterwards I almost always go home and drink. I don‚Äôt get super blackout drunk it‚Äôs more like just drinking a 6 pack everyday until I don‚Äôt care.

My devil is in a bottle.,"Was sober again for about a month or two until I got a new job in a field with heavy alcohol use. Its been a half year since the 4th or 5th fall off the wagon. Ive even started having two beers or even three before my morning commute; my commute is an hour and a half so I‚Äôll be sober by the time work starts right? Im so unwell.

Im 27 and if I keep drinking like this, I legitimately fear for my health. My blood pressure fucking sucks. I get palpitations all the time which have started to hurt a bit after a big night of drinking, and I‚Äôm gaining weight. My muscles and joints ache and sometimes there is blood in my stool.

I got a ride recently from my sister after another night out with coworkers and I got so mad at her for checking in on me. If she didnt pick me up even while I was yelling at her, I think I would have driven and seriously put the lives of others at risk. I also yelled at my wonderful girlfriend Thursday evening when I was wasted for no good reason at all. I an an absolute mess and I know deep down that the reason is alcohol.

I am so incredibly ashamed of myself and reading these stories of people succeeding in their sobriety is making me cry on the train on the way to work.

The most I have ever gone without drinking in the past 6 years is 4 months. I fell back into drinking to try to deal with stress and anxiety. Alcohol undoubtedly just makes my life worse.

I was going to post yesterday but hangover regret isnt as real as real, sober regret. 

I am terrified I am going to fail again but my health and the relationships I have cannot handle the continued drinking. I need help. I need people to tell me that I cannot regulate my drinking and it is not okay to return to alcohol in hopes of moderation.

I want kids. I want to learn guitar. I want to run a 5k. I cant bring children into this world when their father would be an uncontrolled alcoholic. I cant support a family like this.

It's a really cute photo.

It also doesn't show how I shamefully woke up in a very wet spot after wetting the bed. I'm sure we had consumed amounts that could have killed someone who doesn't abuse alcohol.

Nobody who saw that photo would have realized any of this and may have even envied us if they had struggled with their own alcohol problems.

I was still drinking at the time, heavy drinking, seven days a week drinking, so this may have clouded my perception of the show.

For whatever reason, we stopped mid-series and last night started watching it again. If you haven't seen it, it's a 20 minute sketch comedy about a town in Canada and its residents. Wicked funny and sharp as a tack humor. Jared Keeso (Wayne, the lead, and one of the show's writers) is my secret husband. Neither he or my husband know this... but soon, SOON!

Back to the show: HOLY SHIT THEY DRINK A LOT!

Seriously. Each and every show involves either a bar, drinking at home, drinking at a party, drinking at a hockey game, drinking to fight, whatever. 

There is always alcohol! 

We watched the ""Christmas Special"" episode last night, and like what I've done in the past, there was special booze hauled out for the holiday. Shit that no one in their right mind drinks, but for whatever reason was passed around as ""tradition"" and yes, everyone got wasted and sick. In another episode they are at a pre-wedding party and shot after shot are poured to increasingly wasted guests. The camera speed slowed down as the pouring continued and captured the booze not hitting the shot glasses and splashing everywhere. I've been there at our times camping and over-indulging in the woods... 

I actually felt kind of uncomfortable watching all this, but like alcohol, the show is addicting, so I'll probably be back to finish out the series. Is anyone else out there a Letterkenny fan?

Hell: Our stuffed animals could NOT be thrown or treated roughly! Those were REAL, dammit! They had FEELINGS!!!

\*\*\*

I've long had this theory that we got into drugs and alcohol because we lost the magic ... THAT magic. We can no longer sit in dirt and carve little roads for our tiny Hot Wheels or make Barbie create a kick-ass date for Ken in her sick-ass house.

....

Somehow, we became adults. 

...

And some of us missed that so much, that we turned to the booze to create the ""get away, real world!"" feeling. We could live half-assed fantasies on the internet or at bars or parties, but always had this bullshit price to pay.

\*\*\*

Some of us, as teens, let chat rooms and online friends/mystery buddies/crushes take the place of Teddy, Barbie, Hot Wheels, etc etc.

\*\*\*

I'm here to tell you ... that there's a new magic and it's kept me off the sauce and ACTUALLY FUCKING MOVING AROUND instead of being hung over and depressed all goddamn day.

I took the money my sad ass has been saving from not drinking (and it's been shitty, omg) and I bought an Oculus Quest. It sounds SO fuckin' corny and it makes you look like a fresh turd, too. #iDontCare

A buddy walked in on me playing putt putt golf with a nine-year-old who was KICKING MY ASS and watched me laugh and point my ""club"" at him while saying stupid shit, ""Oh yeah? You wait! This next one is MINE, you monster, you!""

He watched, but broke after a few minutes (according to him) because he'd never seen me being so goofy and ""kiddish.""  


VR has not only gotten me off the couch/outta bed, but it's also created new worlds for me that aren't tainted with alcohol triggers.

Facebook? Booze trigger. TV? Same. Insta? Same. Reddit? Ehh. Being around other people? Same. 

With VR, I can hang out with MY inner kid while removing myself from reality so much that I actually FORGET about the adult version of me who likes to drink.  


I've played video games all my life off and on and blah blah yeah yeah yeah. They're cool and all. But to put on a headset that turns your living room into a Tokyo sidestreet that you're walking through while looking for robots who are imitating us? Holding cool guns while protecting citizens they might harm?!

Omg ... it's unreal. You spin ... you look up ... you step to the side ... and all of it has the physics to LITERALLY trick your brain into being in another place, another time, a crisis ... a haunted house ... 

.... .... that patch of dirt we were able to sit in and lose ourselves in as kids.  


I found it in VR.

I sound SO corny, but it's taken me a long time to find something to cure the anhedonia (the inability to feel joy). I still get grumpy, right? But then I put the damn thing over my eyes and something in my brain switches on.

I'd love to see an fMRI of someone playing with one of these. I bet there's something to it.  


I'd put money on it.

I thought it would get better, but honestly lately it's been getting harder and harder.

Every time I go out now, I am absolutely bored out of my brains. I'm not shy or antisocial, I'm a very talkative guy. I talk to everyone. But I just find myself so extremely bored that it's making me depressed. I absolutely can't stand going to Weddings, Bars, Clubs, Birthday Parties, Catching up with friends. It all involves drinking. 90% of the people at these occasions are drinking. I have a lot of friends so I get invited to these things all the time. All I can think of when I'm there is how much FUN I would be having if I was drunk like everyone else. 

I'm honestly pretending that I'm having fun. Trying to trick myself into creating fun by chatting with people. I'm not sad, I've just got the complete LACK of fun. It's as if my brain doesn't make ""fun"" or feel good chemicals at all without alcohol. It's getting so bad to the point where I dread going out at all, I'd rather stay home and watch movies or play games, at least something that is giving my brain a dopamine release.

When I'm out at these kind of events, it's no fun at all, just a complete lack of fun and being extremely bored. The reason I quit drinking in the first place is because I end up binge drinking and can't stop myself, I end up getting out of control and blacking out, which to me still seems better than the latter, being bored and depressed.

My first sober week for a long time is now behind. I have been binge drinking for 3-7 days for a long time. I tried to quit a few months ago and failed miserably. I drank much more this summer than before and gained at least 10 kg in the process. One week ago I was exhausted and wanted to just lie in the bed hoping and fearing for death...

I have learnt a lot from this week. Here goes:

Pros:

* I feel much better physically
* I feel better mentally
* I don't fear waking up in the morning anymore
* I am really happy that I don't lose days to hangover --> drinking
* I've learnt a lot about myself and my thoughts
* I now believe that I can be sober
* **I want to be sober**

Cons:

* My sleep is all messed up and I have trouble falling asleep
* I realise that my physical fitness is crap and it depresses me
* Cravings are kicking in every day (I'm using AF drinks in response to craving, so far so good)
* I remember how I felt 25 years ago (I'm 42 now) when I hadn't started drinking and now I fear I'm never going to get that feeling again
* I look back and feel so bad about the ""wasted years"" and my DUI sentence

However...

There are two cornestones that I rely on:

1. I can't change the past. I can change the future. I **will** change my future. Even if my brains feed me negative thoughts, I just acknowledge them and let go. That I learnt from Cognitive behavioral therapy and it works! 
2. I am building a routine to come to SD and check-in every day. When I do the pledge, I promise not only to myself, but to all of you that I will not drink with you today.  This has saved me three times last week. When I was at the store reaching to buy a sixpack, I remembered that I promised not to drink today. BOOM! A collision between my integrity and desire. Integrity 3 - desire 0. Accountability really works, guys.

So everyone struggling with the first week, just hang on there and keep going. It's going to get better every day. The first week is just the beginning. Let's not drink one day at a time.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello SD.  Yesterday, you shared some brilliant examples of how to kick your day off right. Take a bow, folks of SD, you have got your morning game sorted!  Today, I‚Äôd like to talk about nighttime routines, as poor sleep is something a lot of us sobernauts are plagued with.  We all know that good sleep is vital for health and mental wellbeing, but why is it so damn elusive? ‚ÄúNeverwhere, does that Buddhist monk you were telling us about have any more great insights for us?‚Äù you are no doubt asking.  Why, yes! Yes he does, thank you for asking!

Sleep is no laughing matter for Buddhist monks.  They sleep less, and with a lot less comfort than non-monks.  There was famously a group of Scottish Buddhists who spent 4 years (!) on a retreat sleeping upright in chairs from 11pm to 3:45am only. Seems like masochism, but it was done to free up more time for meditation. When you have such rigidly controlled schedules, it‚Äôs important that you sleep when you are supposed to.  Here are a few things the monks do that most of us mortals don‚Äôt:

1. They only eat breakfast and lunch, and then fast until the next day.  One reason is because they sit around for most of the day doing all that meditating and chanting stuff, which doesn‚Äôt require a lot of calories. But another reason is that if you eat in the evening, your body is still digesting food at bedtime and that interferes with sleep. 
2. Their bedrooms perform one function, and that is to sleep in.  They don‚Äôt use their bedroom to watch TV, eat food, read, play with devices, or indulge in extra- curricular activities.  They don‚Äôt train their brains to expect anything other than sleep when they are in the bedroom. 
3. They sleep in a sea of merit.  That wonderful phrase simply means before they sleep they think about the good things they have done that day, or that week, or that year, because the last thing you think about before you sleep is usually the first thing you think about when you wake up.

 I can‚Äôt say that living a monk‚Äôs life appeals, but perhaps there are some solid ideas here that could be easy enough to implement in pursuit of a good night‚Äôs sleep  - don‚Äôt eat late, remove unnecessary distractions from the bedroom, don‚Äôt ruminate on perceived failings before sleep, but think happy thoughts.

If you feel like sharing, do you have a routine that helps you sleep like a baby?

I‚Äôve heard stories for decades; wild, exhilarating, terrible tales of intoxication and chaos passed down and shared like heirlooms. Generations of bar fights and wired jaws. Rolled pick ups and sham marriages. Barricaded doors and brandished pistols. I was given my first sip when I was 6 years old. I‚Äôve grown old and watched as the new kids were given their first sips. I have not set foot more than an hour sober in my childhood home since I was 14. Despite the tremendous cost alcohol has extracted from my family, both emotionally and physically, alcohol and alcoholism are a sacred ritual and tradition. 

My older cousin visited the big city this weekend, and I had the opportunity to meet him and his son for dinner. I have literally not exchanged sober words with him since 1995. I ordered an iced tea. It took him less than 10 minutes to ask me why I wasn‚Äôt ordering beer, insist that I did, and refuse to accept no for an answer when I told him I didn‚Äôt feel like drinking. He assumed I was just to hung over from the night before. I spilled the beans on recovery. Didn‚Äôt want to, necessarily, but there it is. 

He had 6 with dinner, and 3 the next day at lunch. I drank too much sweet tea and felt like crap, but still probably better than I would have. 

Thing is, I wasn‚Äôt really tempted to drink. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have a better time. But it was hard to handle the look of sadness and disappointment in his eyes when I told him I wouldn‚Äôt toast with him. We were very close when young, and have both seen this whole thing go to shit. I guess I‚Äôm just done contributing to it.

Did I do anything to grow it from a cell to a child, or from child to an adult? No. It needs very little help from me, food and water. It‚Äôs doing it all for me.

Now its full-grown. What to do with a masterful instrument? Before it started to play its song I ran to pour a poison in it. A depressant. Substance that makes me think there‚Äôs sense of purpose in it. In a poison? What is this poison? Where did it come from? It‚Äôs the faeces of another living thing, yeast.

It‚Äôs twisting and turning all the strings of the instrument, making it out of tune. I start to believe I‚Äôm like this, weak and out of tune. I‚Äôm not, it‚Äôs just the instrument smeared with this poison.

It didn‚Äôt need a lot of my help to grow up to be an adult. It doesn‚Äôt need a lot of my help to grow out of this. I stop pouring in the poison, the instrument starts to tune itself right away.

I start to see that I‚Äôm changing, different. My core beliefs about myself change. I am not what I thought I was, neither is the world. Now the way this instrument plays fits in this world. It has its place in it. The thousand strings of the instrument are not out of tune anymore. The song is playing and it only keeps getting better.

The purpose of this instrument is not to be drowned in poison, smeared with the faeces of yeast. Its purpose is to play its song and it plays it well, in tune by itself. That‚Äôs when it shines.

TLDR: The person I am when I'm drunk is the person I've tried so hard not to be. I hurt the love of my life on more than one occasion and lost him. I will not be that person again.

-

I had a nasty temper growing up and would often get into arguments with the people I was close to and I was very abusive towards my younger brother. My mother shares my temper and we have worked together for 10+ years to control our emotions. My brother and I have reconciled and we're close again. Today I can happily say that I am a calmer, nicer person. Until I get drunk.

September 2020 I got blackout drunk and got into a screaming match with my ex-partner of 3 years. I don't remember it happening but I shoved him. 

The next day I woke up at my mother's house with the worst hangover I'd ever had and I made the decision to stop drinking. I never wanted to lose control or hurt someone I love like that again. I gave all my alcohol to a friend, started attending zoom meetings, and started talking about my emotions instead of hiding behind the bottle. I relapsed a couple times but I got back on that wagon every time.

7 months after I decided to stop drinking my ex and I got in a fight and he went to his friends house to get drunk. I decided if he could drink, so could I. So I planned on him being out of the house and went to the liquor store. I blacked out, he came home early, and there was a screaming match. Again, I don't remember it happening but I put my hands on him. He dumped me, rightfully so. 

I lost the love of my life, my home, and the friends that I met through him. Because I chose to drink when I knew what would happen. That was my rock bottom. 

Currently I'm living with my mom and brother, looking to move in with my current boyfriend. These people love me and I will not fuck up another relationship. I will continue to be the stable, happy person I've worked so hard to be.

I had a great time sober! In fact, the big theme I‚Äôve noticed throughout all of these environments I‚Äôve returned to sober is that drinking always made things worse, not better. I am not at that stage of my life where I need alcohol to feel comfortable in social situations. And it never really made me feel comfortable per se, it just inebriated me to the point I couldn‚Äôt think about my anxiety. As usual, I got compliments for being the most energetic person on this dance floor (and this time I was less likely to accidentally step on someone). I felt nice and hydrated drinking water throughout the night. 

At the end of the night I noticed how several people who were drinking a lot in really rough shape and looking miserable. My feet felt a little sore and I was tired, but I felt fantastic not being inebriated and being fully present for the most important day of a dear friend‚Äôs life.

(Can I get a wahoo?) But I'm finding that these 'relapse planning' thoughts have started coming up stronger and stronger. Things like ""one night off"" or ""a break without ruining the progess"" usually offset to the end of the month (when I'll have some time off). And they're getting more and more convincing, especially emotionally. 

But the thing is, I dont want to relapse. I'm still really committed to doing these 6 months sober and then beyond, and giving my brain time to heal from the dopamine rollercoaster I've put it on. This is causing considerable cognitive dissonance and kind of has me stuck.

Most of all, I'm worried the desire to relapse will continue to grow and my will to remain sober will waver and I'll lose my hard won progress. 

So what are your tricks, sobernaughts? How to squash the relapse planning/idealising/day dreaming monster? Even better, how did you get the bastard to shut up for good?

I've been going to the gym (30 minute workouts) three days a week, have lost weight and look and feel younger.

My plan going forward is to set reasonable goals - sober through Thanksgiving, then through Christmas, then through the first of the year. Little goals are easier to achieve.

Not drinking is still far preferable to knowing how I would feel if I started again.

Taking xanax in the morning didn‚Äôt help at all either. Anyways my girlfriends brother got married yesterday and I was worried about all the drinking going on around me and if it would even be fun.

The last few times I've been out with friends I've been left with the most horrible hangover anxiety. Feeling so terrible mentally the next day soils my memories of the experience, and I'm left with misery and self-loathing instead of happy recollections. I know I need to cut back. Until tonight I can't remember the last time I had a day off, yet the idea is scary because I've come to rely on drinking in the evening (a few triple gins and four/five cans of beer) to make me feel better. 

My reasons to cut back are so much stronger than my reasons to continue:
*I'm an active person but I've gained weight recently and don't feel that I'm making the progress I should in my overall fitness/weight loss journey because of booze. I worry about longterm damage if I continue as I am.
* I don't like the person that I am when I'm drunk.
*It worries me how hard I find it to go without. I don't want to rely on alcohol to make me 'feel better'/ less stressed.
*I'm supposed to be moving country soon. I know I will find this stressful and isolating. I worry that if I continue with my current habits they'll spiral out of control in a more stressful situation. 

My worries for the coming weeks are that:
* I live with my parents who drink a lot every evening on a daily basis. I know being around this will make it harder for me to stick to. 
*I'm going to a music festival, where drinking heavily is the norm. I don't want to feel excluded but don't want to ruin my experience by getting terrible hangover anxiety either.
*I'll be meeting with friends and I don't know how to manage the social anxiety aspect without drinking.

But today has been SO hard. The cravings have been insane. My wife (who is super supportive) asked if I was going to continue not drinking forever, because she feels bad asking me to buy her wine if I'm not drinking. My alcoholic ass Twists that into a rational reason to drink. I should drink because she wants to and she won't because I'm not. This isn't true... And I know this. But it's there.

I've also struggled with a sense of identity in the last few days. Has anyone else experienced this? Going through shirts, looking for something to wear and realizing how many shirts I have that are alcohol-related. A shirt that says 'drinks well with others' . A shirt  this says  'boozed and Confused' . A shirt that says Santa's Little Helper with a picture of Santa Claus holding a bottle of Jack Daniels.

I started drinking when I was 13 (an adult boyfriend, yay) and the most I'd gone before was just a couple months.

Now I'm 27 and it's 1 freaking year sober. 

But here goes what's on my mind right now. It was easier in the very beginning when I decided to quit. I made a promise and the next day I was done with alcohol for good. It was so exciting to change my life like that, start to regularly take meds, start taking care of myself... However, the longer I go without alcohol the weirder it feels. Like, I hit that milestone so it means I can go back to drinking, right? Relapses happen, so it may happen to me now, too. So many things are not going my way, so that's a good excuse to grab that bottle of wine, right?

Drinking was always something to do when life was tough, and there were bonus points it numbed my emotions. I used to be addicted to other things like sex or shopping, but alcohol seems to have the biggest control over my life. Still. Even after a year sober.

So I was just wondering. Were your thoughts similar to mine? I hit a milestone, cool, I proved that I can do it and it's time to come back to my old ways? I keep reminding myself of how horrible I was feeling drunk and god, the hangovers... How do you deal with those cravings? Are they normal? Do they ever go away?

I'm just so confused right now, I'd love to hear your perspective.

Two weeks ago she sent the cops over again. The reason they were here is because I asked when I could see my kids. So my life has been difficult to say the least.

She wants me to sign off on her having full custody in order to be able to see my children.¬† Obviously using the children as leverage. My lawyers fees are mounting and I still haven't been able to have visits with my kids.

Oh. And I found out that my ex has been cheating on me and my second child may not be mine. So that's pretty great. 

I'm sorry I'm not sure how to make this post positive in any way. But I'll give it a try. So it's been 3 months without a drink. Almost as long without smoking weed. I have my wits about me at all times. Mostly so I can defend myself against false allegations. I look less bloated. I have lost about 10 pounds.I've been doing 10 k walks on Saturday and Sunday. Sometimes I exercise before work too. I completed an online parenting class and was thinking of signing up for another one. I've read 3 parenting books. 3 books on alcohol and sobriety. 4 law and divorce books. As well as more than a few self help books. Last weekend I finished 3 books. I was proud of myself.¬† I'm doing therapy including anger management. 

When I was drinking I was not the easiest person to get along with. I was always thinking of my next drink or shaking a hang over. I would have never have described myself as an angry person but I must have sure come across that way. I saved all my anger for at home. For the people that I loved the most. My relationship with the ex wasn't the greatest. Part of that was on me that's for sure. I ruminated in negative thoughts so often. I was depressed. The alcohol helped to keep me down.¬† Maybe if I hadn't been drinking so much I would have given more thought to how I was treating those around me. As well as how I was treating myself.  Alcohol is not an excuse for me to be a jerk but I guess it was part of the reason. 

I've lost a lot. I've learned almost as much. I think I have matured more as a person in these past few months than I have in the past few years. Alcohol had put my life on pause and stumped my growth.¬† I hope my story will be a warning to those of you out there who are still struggling. This sub is here for you just like they have been for me. I've made some good friends on here that I still talk to regularly. They were there for me in the darkest times. I owe them so much.

Then my business closed and my husband had a mental health crisis and now I've just had to fire my lying/narcissistic manager a few weeks ago. I have had a really hard couple of years and now it seems I've lost control of my drinking and I do it pretty much every day. I've gained 30 lbs and I'm only 5'2.
I am writing this because I am quitting today, at least for a little while. I'm scared because I am running from a lot of big, scary emotions surrounding all of these things I mentioned. I have been to therapy, but I had to stop seeing this last one. It's a lot and wine seems to be my only savior right now. But I know I'm letting it get out of control so I have to stop.

My biggest fear was brain, liver, kidney and fertility damage but i kept going and convincing myself that i could cut myself off at one glass. The last time i drank was August 4th, so yeah it hasn't even been a week of sobriety but i know this is how i want to live the rest of my life. I've never felt such conviction about moving forward. It's been hard as hell to balance my sleep schedule but i vie to be normal again. It's been a very very very long process and the feelings i had before when ""quitting"" aren't there. The desire to feel death on my lips has completely gone from me and my will to live has returned. I've done so much soul searching and gained self awareness throughout the process of ""quitting"" that has brought me to this moment. I've had a lot of fucked up things happen in my early adulthood. It's like i wanted to wallow in that pain but i finally found the strength to let that person go. To move on. I was truly heartbroken over what i had done to myself and began the grieving steps. I had to let part of me die so i could LIVE happily and i really hope everyone here can do the same. Don't punish yourself, you deserve happiness and i know those hangovers hurt like a bitch. Even if you continue to drink, please try to look within yourself and find that root reason as to why. What are you trying to escape? 

I sound selfish but i could never find reason in quitting for people i care about. Yes, i had regrets about hurting them but i could always push them away with my anger and be left alone like i thought i deserved to be. My overwhelming fear of failure/success brought me to believe i wasn't capable of much anyway....so why would anyone see worth in being around me? I really had to learn self worth and self love all over again. I had to tie up loose ends to start a new string of life.

 On August 5th i looked in the mirror for the longest time i ever have in a long time and just completely broke down. Who the hell was i? What am i doing? Why am I self harming in such a detrimental way?  I just screamed that ""I'm sick of this"". Not waking up on time for work. Embarrassing myself in front of people. Having my partner question their future with me. Running up my credit card. Not being a great dog owner. Not being good to myself in general. I don't hate me anymore and tbh....i don't think i ever could. It wasn't hard decision anymore and i chose me.

A little background:

I think unlearning social pressures really made me feel more fulfilled in life. I'm 25, with a fianc√© and no kids. Abortion forced onto me by my mom when i was 16. Kicked out of the house at 17. Got pregnant again at 19 while living out of my car and gave her up for adoption to my ex's aunt since she couldn't have children. The entire relationship with him was toxic but i know we've both experienced trauma from not only losing one, but two children due to irresponsibility. My entire family condemned me and made me feel as if I made a terrible decision and it often made me question myself but deep down i always knew i did the right thing. I saw photos of her just a few days before my last drink and i hadn't seen her since she was 1. She looked so happy, well taken care of and at peace. I finally felt justified. I never felt like i made good decisions but i ignore just about every big and small success that comes my way. I felt clarity for the first time. That closure was the last bit i needed to finally feel worthy of anything.

If you made it this far, thanks for letting me express my journey. I didn't get too much into detail about the sex trafficking I've been through or homelessness because seeing my daughter was the last and most sensitive piece of me that healed. It was a positive note to come into for my sobriety. I really hope you all here in this sub can forgive yourself because you deserve it. Guilt is was dragged me down for so many years and it lead me to binge drinking for almost 2 years straight. Forgiveness isn't forgetfulness, it's letting unneeded weight off your shoulders so you can rise again.",67,0

(First seizure was sometime in 2012/13, though I have now got a year plus all clear from a grand malignant one)

Sometimes I would be expecting them, would fit then just spend the next day or two really delirious, shaking and overall not to ""sharp"".

Then they continued, I eventually learnt that if I was on anything less than 70mg Valium a seizure ""could"" occur. Started drinking around 2016/17 when I realised that drink could substitute the Valium. Being short acting though, I went from sporadic, to having a seizure at least a few times a week.

The amount of drugs I needed to just stay level and sustain the drunken state not to seize was immense.

I never saw anything, never imagined anything BUT I would forget/remember almost anything and say/do almost anything. (It was not uncommon to find myself surrounded by strangers, having took a fit on the street, talking in ""tongues"" and barbling/garbling sentences, sometimes coherent, mostly just completely non sensical)

In the 300 days since I have stopped drinking, for the first 150 days I still had absent seizures (just stare of into space), though this is on my own doing nothing. What scares me is if I start getting busy, I will just a have a return to episodes of seizures.

I startled awake to a commotion from my husband's side of the bed. Apparently he was having a very vivid dream in which he took a flying leap off the front steps of a house, trying to nab some thieves who were in the process of breaking in. Back in the real world, he took a dive off the bed and smashed his face on his nightstand on the way down. He had a laceration across the bridge of his nose, and more concerning, another laceration and a few abrasions along the lower rim of his left eye. His vision was fuzzy from the blood filling his eye, and there was no way he could wear his glasses. (And without his glasses, he is super nearsighted - as in, as far as he can tell, I have no face until he puts his glasses on in the morning.) I grabbed him an ice pack and a handtowel, threw on some clothes, and drove him to the ER. Fortunately, there doesn't seem to be any damage to his eye that might permanently threaten his vision. The doc used some crazy glue (cyanoacrylate) to close up the cut below the eye, and told us to apply antibiotic ointment to the other cuts until they heal. Tomorrow, I'm going to work from home and hopefully bring my husband to see an opthalmologist, just to be on the safe side (the ER doc was pretty confident that the eye is fine, but he thought it would be good to get an expert, specialist opinion). 

Anyway, getting to my point...I am INCREDIBLY grateful that I was sober and not hungover so that my husband could rely on me to get him to the ER and help keep him comfortable and safe after his mishap. If I had passed out in a drunken stupor Saturday night and woken up too sick to get dressed and drive anywhere, we would have had to call an ambulance, or at least a taxi, and the ordeal would have been even more miserable for my husband. I'm glad that he has been able to rest today, confident that I will be here, sober and ready to help in whatever way he needs, when he wakes up. Obviously, it would be best if the accident hadn't happened at all, but being someone that my husband can rely on at a time like this really highlights what a gift it is to be sober. Thank you all for helping me get to this point!

Currently doing a dry month and feeling good, but there are a few activities that are harder for me than others. Specifically:

Cooking--got into the habit of cooking with a glass of wine (more accurately...at least a bottle of wine). 

Meeting up with people--I'm fortunate that my friends are all either sober, light drinkers or not pushy about drinking, but now that things where I live are starting to open up & I'm fully vaccinated I'm trying to meet new people and go on dates. It's hard to shake the mindset that I would be more fun, the date would be less awkward or people would just like me more if I had a buzz.

Talking to my mom on the phone--Not to turn this into a therapy session, I love my mom and we have a good relationship, but talking to her is frustrating. I definitely built up the habit of calling her when I had a glass of wine in hand--our conversations were better, longer and the wine blunted a lot my frustrations. (She's never given any indication that she's noticed.) Now that I'm not drinking, our conversations are shorter, it's harder for me to not snap at her when she does thinks like interrupt or says things that make it clear she hasn't been listening.

So...anyone have similar habits or triggers? Any tips or techniques that helped you?

One minute, I said to myself ‚Äúthis is just part of the addiction. You‚Äôre going to have these cravings. Remember the hangovers!‚Äù The next minute, I said ‚Äú Nope, I‚Äôm just going to drink.

I'm 31, and struggled with binge drinking to cope with anxiety and depression for over 10 years. Blackouts were common. Health was starting to fail, like liquid poops and constant vomiting. 

I finally broke down and realized i couldn't wean myself down. I have an all or nothing with alcohol. I cannot do it. I fessed up to my partner about how bad it really was. He was 100% supportive and felt bad he hadn't realized exactly how bad it was. I hid my drinking from as many as I could. I was ashamed but felt like it was outside of my control. 

For 2 months after i stopped drinking I would shake, randomly and violently. Not seizures! Drop what i was holding, legs unable to hold me up, but i was not having seizures. 2 weeks into sobriety they were so bad we went to an er. When they brought a wheelchair for me and declared me an emergent case i broke down crying apologizing to my partner. In my mind, it was my fault for drinking. My fault we were going through all this. ER's are expensive, and i don't have health insurance. He and the nurses just reassured me I was exactly where i needed to be. 

Turns out, the shakes were repressed anxiety. I was drinking so much to combat the level of anxiety i felt. Between that and the addiction i was rapidly spiraling down. 

But here i am now, almost a year later, standing strong, having lost weight, deepened my relationships, making better choices and having SO much more fun being *present* in my life. 

Kicking the addiction sucks *ass* those first few months. It took a lot of support. My partner would remind me that this sucks, but it would suck having to do it *again and again*. And that kept me going a lot of the time. I have no regrets. And navigating the world of social drinking is becoming easier for me to politely decline.

Moments later, my husband showed up and took me to the hospital. While there, I lied to the nurses and doctors and told them I must have had some sort of neurological event.

3368,2021-08-08 09:40:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/p0eu7x/my_story/,My story...,"  

Hello everyone,

long story short, I am an alcoholic. At this point 28M.

I'm writing this down as it may help someone but main, I'm writing this down so I can go through it when I'll be on the edge again. Most of the story doesn't involve drinking but it helps me to see the points in my life that throw me over the edge.

When I went through the Saturday Shares, I noticed a lot of people had rough childhood or for some reason started drinking at a young age. My childhood was quite hood it's hard to compare. I can't remember my first drink but sometimes my parents let me taste a bit of champagne on New Year‚Äôs or beer during the grilling parties or during visits to some of their friends or family.

I started ""truly"" drink during high school. By the word truly I mean I was 18 and could order or buy drinks by myself but still, alcohol wasn't a big part of my life. When we went to a pub or bar, I sometimes drank a lot but I puke only once as far as I remember and most of the time, I didn't do anything to truly embarrass myself. But as I said visits to a pub were usually on monthly basis very rarely more frequent and usually, I drank ""responsively"" for that age (4-5 beers at most).

As I think about it, the biggest mistake was when I went to university. I don't want to sound conceited but I was top of my class and I rarely need to study at home as I understood it from the class. Maybe because of that I wanted and ultimately went to university in a different city as it presented itself as more prestigious, I wanted to try to live on my own and the city in question is the most student city in my country.

None of my friends wanted to leave my home city as they saw it wasn't worth it to study harder for the same academic title (engineer in IT). I was sad about this because I am introverted and I am unsure how to make friends. During high school, it was easier as we saw each other every day. I consider my high school years as the best part of my life based on the group of friends I had and the no worries about classes or work. Don't worry I am still in touch with them, two of them are now my coworkers. So, I didn't let them go completely.

But still, I went. I think this was the first big mistake a made. The first semester was easy as I knew most of it from high school which was technically focused. Still, I tried my best, I lived on the campus but my roommate dropped out after the first semester. Each year I got a different roommate but when you live with someone 24/7 you see a thing that annoys you and because of that, I didn't stay in touch when they moved out. I made friends in classes but because of a high volume of drops out and each class was something like an elective with different people it was hard for me to stay in touch with them (there weren't any clubs or groups like people can see in American movies so this wasn't truly an option). So, I joined the student's union as I thought it will have a more stable group of people. I was correct in that part but it didn't feel the same as with my friends from high school. I think it was a mistake on my part to expect it to feel the same.

During this time, I started to spend more time in my room usually do some of my classwork. As the first semester was easy for me, I got lazy and had a hard time the next and the next. Uni involved a lot of what I would call ""do it alone"". To be honest I can't recall most of this time but mainly as I tried to focus on classes and finish my degree. Still, I wasn‚Äôt drinking much. Maybe once a week with my student union group but event there it was like 3 beers during the evening. I think a lot of students drunk more but this is my story.

I finished my bachelor's degree, had to extend my studies from 3 years to 4 years, and almost got kicked out during last semester (because of my grades) but I finished it. Now the second big mistake: I decided to stay at the same university for my master's degree. I truly don't know why I did it. I didn't enjoy the city; the classes were hard and I did not enjoy them and if I went back to my home city it would be less stressful for the same degree and I would be with my friends.

During my first year of the master's, I realized I need a change. So, I quit my student unions work and sign up for the Erasmus program (something like an exchange program for students in the EU). I went to Wales for a year. I was in the UK on several occasions before (even for work for a month) and I truly loved it. I thought I'll do a bit of traveling find some friends and who knows maybe I'll stay there.

Once again classes were easy as I knew them from my university (I sign up for a program designed for people without any programming experience). The professors were awesome, my classmates were awesome. On the contrary to my university back home which involves 300-600 students in Wales, we were a tight group of 10 people. Unfortunately, all of them were out of town and drove to campus and the area where I lived only once or twice a week.

But I didn't want to make the same mistake again. In the UK there are clubs and groups. So, I join several of them. I also started playing Pokemon Go with the local group so I could explore more and have something to force me to go for a walk.

Here is where it went truly downhill for me. When we had a night with my classmates it involved drinking. Cider and J√§germeister with Red Bull. The clubs‚Äô meetings were mostly the same. We did some activity and afterward, we went to a pub. My housemates were ok, but because of different believes and interests, I didn't spend much time with them. Usually, I just say ""Hi"" and went to my room.

A few weeks later when I was returning from a Pokemon GO meeting I stopped at Tesco for some ciders. Another few weeks and this was my daily routine, go for a short walk and buy 4-8 cans of cider on the walk back. I stopped attending clubs meeting. I still went to classes but as I said, most of it I already knew so this wasn't a problem. I think I realized I had a problem when I waited till the shops open so I can buy more ciders and continue my drinking. But I thought this is something like a vacation, when I get back, I will stop.

I finished my courses and went back. During the summer I drank a few beers my parents had at home. I usually went to a store during the day to buy 2-3 if they needed them but ultimately drank them in the evening.

Then I went back to university for what was supposed to be my last year of master's. In my country, the Master's program is 2 years but I extended it to 3 years because of my year in Wales. And there I drunk. I really did not enjoy my classes and was stressed about them so I drunk to forget. Usually, a bottle of wine a night usually alone in my room.

I remember going to my parents and telling them I will be dropping out and them saying ""But you are so close"", ""If you drop out now you will regret it afterward"". I hate letting them down so I stayed. When my deadline for my master's thesis was coming up, I went to a doctor and honestly say that I am miserable, sad and stress from classes because of that I drink much more than I should. Together we decided I should interrupt my studies if I can, focus on my health, and consider if I want to finish my degree next year. Meanwhile, I was sent to psychiatry and on liver tests.

I finished my exams and people from the university agreed with my request to interrupted my studies as only my master thesis and final master exam were left. I was glad for this but I realized that now it would be even harder to drop out as I am really close to finishing it. I did get checked on my livers and I had elevated AST and ALT (I think these are the correct) so I was sent to another test with the result: Enlarged livers.

My psychiatrist said these results are usually found if you are an alcoholic. This is the time I wasn‚Äôt completely honest with my doctors and as a result, now I am worried about my health. I brushed it off as not a big deal. Yes, I drunk more than I should because of classes but now when I don't have them everything will be alright. She advised me to stop drinking for at least several months and prescribed me so mild antidepressants as I was saying nothing makes me happy. In retrospect, the drinking is the true cause (or at least I thought so).

Through my friend from high school, a got a job with truly wonderful colleagues. I limited my drinking during that summer for ""only"" a couple of beers a night sometimes I went without them. But during the fall a went back to a bottle of wine a night and during that time I would say I was a functional alcoholic. A bottle of wine in the evening, fall asleep, wake up go to work, and repeat.

At the begging of 2020 the pandemic hit. As I work in the IT field, I was able to work from home but that means my access to alcohol was more limited. As I have limited access to a car and there is only one shop in the walking distance. I didn't want to be seen as an alcoholic in their eyes. And because of being a soberer with clearer thoughts and with pressure from my parents, I decided I'll try to finish my degree.

I finished my thesis; my supervisor wasn't completely happy with it but it was possible. Then I took a holiday at work so I can study. During this holiday I didn't drink but I was so stressed I don‚Äôt know I manage it. And then the day of the exam. I passed with my thesis but almost didn't pass my ""knowledge"" exam as I had trouble expressing myself. Luckily for me, one professor realized what‚Äôs going on and helped.

So, I got my degree everything should be alright now, right? No, I celebrated with a drink. And then I drunk more as I return to work. At the end of 2020, I knew I need to do something as I wasn‚Äôt happy and I only lived on a day-to-day basis. I also started to get some pain on the right side of the chest and this really scared me. Also, my finger in my left arm was constantly tingling so I also probably damaged my nerves with my drinking.

At some point, I came across this subreddit and manage to make a plan. Stop drinking for at least a month, then go to the doctor and check up on my liver. Hopefully, it wasn‚Äôt be permanently damaged. I started strong a made it to 24 days in February. But of course, then I slipped. Had one-day bender bud got right back on track and made it to 10 days. The next two weeks involved heavy drinking until once again a felt the liver pain. So, I stopped for 37 days (not sure why I didn't go to a doctor at the time).

From then it's mostly the same pattern. I made it through 2 weeks then have 3-5 days of heavy drinking (including day drinking). As I still can work from home, I could hide it from collages. I usually work during the weekend afterward just to make it up for the drunk time. So far nobody has made a comment about this.

But this time it was different. My parents found out. When I was in bed this Friday, I made a decision. I tried to stop by myself but clearly, I cannot do this. So, this time a will tell to all people which are important to me. Yesterday (Saturday) a told my parent ""I have a drinking problem but please can we talk about it tomorrow as I can't think at this moment"". Then I spend all day reading through posts here, mostly in Saturday Shares, and decided I need to write this down for my own sake.

At this moment I am at 45 hours. Yes, I am at the point where I need to count every hour. Had about 3 hours of sleep but mostly a was shaking, sweating, and freezing during the night. At this point, I am very tired, have the shakes a little, still cannot think clearly (maybe it is recognizable from this post), I am very anxious and my skin is peeling off from the dehydration. Yesterday I knew I need to eat something to help me get my stomach to shape and I drunk 4/5 of days‚Äô worth of drink that should be able to replace a normal meal. I knew I would be able to keep down any solid food and slowly drinking this help me. As of right now, I don‚Äôt feel nauseous.

But my main worry is my liver, it hurts again. That is the main reason I need to stop. Still hoping there is no permanent damage.

Right now, I need to get my thoughts together, hopefully, I will be able to work tomorrow, and hopefully, I still have a job. I already had a small talk with my parents but I need to tell my friends but the most important is to have an honest talk with my doctor, hope everything is still reversible and follow his advice.

If you read this far, thank you.

Thank you all for your post, I will check on you and try to contribute to my journey. We can do this together.

It was a night out in ""town"" with all my younger cousins, sibling and our partners for a 21'st birthday. I honestly thought that would be the night I caved and said oh well, its been a month, you can have a drink. But I knew if I did I would regret it! So I drove, drank soda, conversed and had a really nice night. Admittedly I didn't dance as much as everyone else but I saved over ¬£100 quid on EXPENSIVE drinks. (Doubles were about ¬£7,  I wouldn't have been on singles and drinking at lease two to everyone else's one, probably sneaked a hipflask, plus extra pints... you know the drill) I didn't look a crazy sweaty mess though, still had a kebab and don't have a hangover today :-)

I'm really proud of myself and it just proves you can do it with no regrets, infact the only time I felt some mixed feeling was when I drove passed a pub and saw a could of blokes outside enjoying a pint. I miss some of the old (drinking) friendships I had over my years. However, deep down I know that situation would have likely ended up with me in a right state at god knows what in the morning, so it soon passed :-)

Moral of the story is, at 41, I really am too old to dance the night away. Plus, friends and family will respect you more for making a stand in your own beliefs. Good luck on your journey through a better life friends. iWNDWYT",11,0

I swam in the lake because my trainer pushed me and I had mentioned I swam as a kid. 

I have a trainer because after years of working out alone and sabotaging myself while drinking, i got sober and I believed in myself enough financially and physically to hire one. 

I felt strong enough to share a goal with my trainer because I wasn‚Äôt drinking, alcohol wasn‚Äôt stealing my confidence anymore. 

I was brave enough to try because sobriety has taken away the anxiety that stole everything from me, crippled me and made me convinced I would fail, at everything (except drinking of course). 

I was able to meet him at 10am on a Saturday without worry because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be drinking the night before. I can‚Äôt stress how much I dreaded weekend plans when I was drinking. Literal anger at people trying to monopolize my drinking time!!! 

Honestly, it was really hard and a little demoralizing (I am so slow lord have mercy) but i did it!! I‚Äôm headed to the pool now to practice again. 

It‚Äôs hard to express how this is so closely linked to my sobriety but it is. It so is. Before I stopped I was so SO scared all the time. Scared of what I had done the night before. Scared for my mental health. Scared of failing. Scared of the cravings. Scared of 3am. Scared of waking up. Scared of who I had become. SCARED that there was no way out. 

I‚Äôm still scared (of something touching my leg while swimming üòÇüòÇ)but I‚Äôm so so happy. I never thought I had this quality of life within me.

Rocky Recovery Journey,"I've been lurking for months, but decided to post finally because I want to join in and not just lurk. I drank for years and then became a heavy drinker after my divorce and throughout the pandemic. I've been in a recovery program for a few months building skills but not always sober or committing to my own recovery. 

I've done all the stupid shit that addicts do, jeopardized myself, my children, my job. I have scars from falling, burning myself while drinking and cooking, and who knows what else. I don't remember most nights from the past few years. 

A few weeks ago my partner left me because I chose alcohol over him and he was done. It was a horrible reality that I've had to face because he is also my best friend and took very good care of me. We still talk and have seen each other a few times, but it's different; it has to be. While losing him is tough, it's probably the best thing that has happened to me because I've had to be with myself, to learn to take care of myself, and acknowledge my addiction and its consequences in new ways. I have had to accept accountability for myself, my life, and my choices. 

I'm working on daily self care and keeping my journal close. I've had long streaks of sobriety but wasn't ready or interested in dealing with the past and the WHY behind my addiction. It's hard, but over the last few weeks I feel like I've been more honest with myself than I have in the last 10 years.

It will be two weeks on Monday from my last relapse. Currently I am looking through the window on a pleasant Sunday morning, enjoying my coffee and thinking how many mornings like this I have missed throughout the years. 

In my last few attempts I have noticed that I can go for a few days or even weeks sober with relative ease, but then as easy as that felt, I suddenly hit a wall somewhere and drink again. And I think I have finally figured out that, as long as I don't address whatever underlying motives push me towards drinking, I'm not going to succeed in this. I'm quite good at developing practical strategies that keep me away from drinking, but those ""practical solutions"" don't involve any profound or meaningful change in the ways I relate and connect to the world. They are simple guidelines to maximize my chances of staying sober when I get triggered. But they are not foolproof and when they fail I get back to square one. I can't figure out a pattern; sometimes I feel I have built an impregnable stronghold to protect myself against the urge and sometimes, just like that, all the defenses disappear quantum-leap-magic-style and I am completely vulnerable and naked, fighting the dragon with a rotten stick and a watermelon helmet. It's tiresome. But if I indulge on self-pity I will eventually drink again.

Up til now things were going smoothly and I was feeling better for having quit. I lost 12 pounds, my anxiety seemed better, and I felt like my mood had improved.

Cue where it starts to go wrong.

When I told my husband how much weight I had lost, instead of a ""congratulations"" I was met with a ton of anxiety from him about how ""that's not normal"" and he's worried about my health. For perspective, I'm about 125-130 pounds normally. When I originally quit drinking I was pushing 140. I'm back down to 128 now. I can understand how he could be concerned, especially since I wasn't actively TRYING to lose weight, and I agreed to talk with our doctor about it.

A fight ensued, because he felt like I wasn't taking his concerns seriously enough, and I felt like there was nothing I could do to immediately solve the problem, so I would keep an eye on it and talk to a doctor when their office opened. I told him I didn't want to continue to focus on it, because I would easily panic and spiral from there.

Then we had a fight about communication, because he still felt like I was brushing him off and I felt like he wasn't wanting to believe me when I said I understood his concerns. He also brought up how he felt like my anxiety has been ""through the roof"" the past couple weeks. I was growing increasingly frustrated and panicked because I felt like there was literally nothing I could do or say that would convince him I'm hearing him, and he just kept saying we're not communicating well and that I'm not being receptive to all the issues he feels like I'm having. 

I have autism so sometimes I say things in a tone that I don't intend, or misread a tone of someone else's, but I really felt like I was understanding things in this particular instance. I got so frustrated because I felt like just because I wasn't saying whatever magic words he wanted me to say, I was somehow in the wrong and not understanding.

He's just stormed out to go to the store, and I know he's going to be cold and distant when he gets back. I don't know what I did or how I can even attempt to fix it, and honestly it feels like all my progress just doesn't matter. I'm so frustrated and I just want to go back to sleep for the day and try again tomorrow.

Good new is: I don't even have any desire to drink. I don't particularly have any desire to be awake and feeling anything right now, but IWNDWYT.

Anyway, there's a large chance no one will read this but I needed to just vent before mentally checking out for the day. Thanks to those of you who listened. I'm going to bed (it's 8 in the morning and I literally just woke up before this all happened) and trying again tomorrow

EDIT: thanks you for all the kind words and support. I wasn't expecting this post to get as much attention as it did but I'm grateful for all the words of wisdom and support. For context, my husband has never really been a drinker, and he stopped completely the same time I did. He's been incredibly supportive this whole time; this is literally the first big fight we've had since I quit drinking, which I think is why it upset me so much.

I have a history of losing too much weight/obsessing about my body image and I think his reaction was definitely coming from a place of concern, I just didn't know how to alleviate his worries. Some of you suggested giving him some space and then bringing it up again- I think that's the right idea. He was mad for a little bit when he got back from the store but after a couple hours he stopped acting mad and we just kinda dropped it. I think the best way, like some of you said, that I can ease his stress level is by talking with my doctor about the weight loss. He'll feel better if the doctor says it's normal. If the doc says it's abnormal weight loss, well... We'll go from there but at least we'll know.

&#x200B;

What brought me here:

&#x200B;

72 hours ago, I (20M) woke up in the middle of the night after a 2 day bender in which I drank almost 2L of vodka, absolutely desperate for the woozy head-empty that being drunk as hell gives me so I can ignore racing thoughts and how awful it is to be alone with myself.

4 hours later, head spinning as i lay on my yoga mat desperately praying for my boyfriend to come back home after he went to spend a a night or two with his friends, suddenly I'm puking green bile all over my floor and ran as fast as i could to my trashcan. I couldnt keep any food or liquid down for another twelve hours straight, and was continuously forcefully vomiting and shitting up a storm. I thought I could get over it myself and after some time it would be better, oh I just need to wait a few days to reset myself and not go as hard, until I started vomiting blood and the pain got continuously worse. 

My boyfriend came back to my home, with my roommates mom was listening to me cry about all of the ways ive been destroying myself these past years and how I didn't want to die like this.

He sped me to the ER and thankfully by that point the vomiting had almost subsided and that was that. The doctor didn't really take me as seriously as they should have, as I was given fluids and various anti nausea medicine with a reccomendation to seek further help. 

And now I'm here after 3 days of only sleeping 3 hours, all three of which filled with night terrors that left me waking up crying.

&#x200B;

Some background about myself:

&#x200B;

I have been suffering from some severe sexual abuse that continued through my childhood and its affected my entire life thus far. This, along with awful bullying, low mental health (bipolar 1 and ADHD), etc.. It led to low life satisfaction and eventually I turned to substances. 

I didn't drink consistently until I was a bit older, specifically 18, but before that it was marijuana at 14, opiates at 16, and a constant attempt to get alcohol but not being able to. I thankfully was never addicted to opiates and as soon as I no longer had access to them I didn't want to obtain any more. 

All my life I also watched my father fall over and over again to his many addictions and ruin not only his life but my life as well, as I was the target of all of his anger and hatred. I really thought I would never drink but when I started drinking with friends I justified it was okay because I was happier drunk while my father was angry and violent. 

I started couch-hopping a bit in highschool and decided to absolutely fuck off across the country and go to uni in Japan.

In uni I was hesitant at first to go to my first bar, it was anxiety inducing to be in an environment like that when I had only drank a handful of times previously. Immediately I was hooked by the laughter and the rush of also being in a place that I knew my family would hate and everyone back home would be so awed by.. and I loved being drunk with my friends in such a vibrant city where alcoholism really is the norm. At home I smoked plenty, so I didnt think about drinking, but there every other substance is incredibly restricted. Hell, I was hardly able to get paperwork for some of my medications, and wasn't able to approve for adderall either.

People in trains in the morning with beers, 200yen tall boys less than a block away from my dorm- I was never carded there. 

I became first the college kid going out to the bar on a Friday after a week of studying hard to reward myself with my friends, but still getting all of my work done to my best ability. 

Then I became the one drinking with my friends a bit more often, because I got my work done beforehand so it was fine! No problem. Got a job and then it was two tall boys after work because holy shit did my  body hurt from being in school full time and working as a dishwasher at a bar after classes every day for another 8-10 hours. 

Then I realized I could easily buy liquor at grocery stores, and it became a few drinks during my study time. COVID hit, and these drinks became during my last classes, during my easy classes- I had nothing better to do at home at all by this time. I had two severe manic episodes, followed by extreme depression.  Drinking myself to death as I couldnt afford my summer semester and therefore had to leave the country and then later drop out completely due to financial difficulties and no familial support.

I had to fly home, quarantine to get immediately kicked out of my house and went to live with my best friend and her family. There, they didn't care what I did- I was actually an adult to them! Marijuana use in the house, liquor, anything- they didn't mind as long as I worked hard and continued to pursue my future. 

So I did. I worked full time overnight, did community college part time, and all the while with consistent smoking (which actually hasnt caused any problems for me) and occasional drinking, as I had a hospital scare in Japan. I didn't learn though and it became shots upon shots every time I had the chance for some free time. 

I used to be an artist. I used to sew, knit, sculpt, paint, read books for hours upon hours on end.. I love history, video games, baking, cooking, films, puzzles, writing, philosophy... my boyfriend says its that I'm a walking encyclopedia that had him hooked on me immediately even though he never thought he would even become close with me to begin with. And I threw that away to sit in my room cross-faded and watch tv or do nothing really. I dont want this anymore. I'm tired of it. I hurt him so badly and he still hasnt done anything but be the most supportive and understanding person I've ever met in my life. Reassures me he loves me no matter any of my flaws and wants to see me excited for self improvement. 

I'm ready for change! I want this. I have to move out in 3 weeks, my room in shambles, I quit my job due to harassment issues and need to find a new one, along with proper treatment for my various illnesses.. So I'm done. I always want to be away from myself though. Its really difficult, to not just consume something  quick and easy thatll make me feel better. But its not, it just hurts more. 

My eyes are finally getting heavy. I'm exhausted. The night sweats and sleep paralysis are debilitating for me right now. However I  have the love of my life by my side constantly to distract me. I'll be moving into his home most likely while I seek partial hospitalization because that has helped before. 

But for now, I will just push through and pick up the pieces of my life.",16,2

It takes place at an expensive resort so there's lots of drinking. In fact, there is an addiction arc involving the hotel manager. Anyway, I was watching a scene in which a character played by Jennifer Coolidge is being helped into bed after drinking all day. The character is dressed up, hair and make-up slightly out of place, too drowsy to move so another character arranges her on the bed and tells her she'll be fine in the morning. 

Suddenly it occurred to me how many times I've seen simulations of drunkenness on TV - so many that it's become totally normalized, something like a comic bit: _ha ha, can relate, humans are so silly, bet she'll feel crummy in the morning_ etc. 

Then I remembered that Coolidge was just pretending. She still had her character's makeup on, looked healthy and attractive. Even if she'd thrown up, it probably would have been framed in a comical way. 

The next day, reading a David Sedaris story about his mum's alcohol disorder, I looked up the show ""Intervention,"" which somehow I'd never heard of. I watched a few clips of people addicted to alcohol and boy did it break my heart. Puffy, bloated faces. Stilted, stiff movements. That raw, pinched looked. Easy to anger, paranoid, unreasonable accusations and defensiveness. True incapacitation. It was impossible not to see immediately who the addicted person was since everyone else looked normal and capable. The afflicted people looked like walking pain. 

Not everyone who has problems with alcohol looks like this, although I'm sure many do, at least some of the time (I sure did). What broke my heart too was how much I'd normalized representations of ingesting poison, albeit without these changes to appearance and personality. What they show in the movies as alcoholic drinking is only rarely remotely faithful to the actual experience. It seems obvious now, but the contrast with what I saw on ""Intervention"" was eye-opening.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello SD, I hope you are all well on this fine Sunday morning.  Like many of my fellow sobernauts, I have been working on figuring out happier and healthier ways of living.  I‚Äôve been researching different viewpoints and recently listened to a talk from a Buddhist monk on how your daily habits can profoundly influence your whole life.  For  example,  the way you make your bed in the morning can say a great deal about the type of person you are.  ‚ÄúWhat on earth are you waffling on about, Neverwhere?‚Äù, you might be asking right about now, but bear with me.

Say you get up and make your bed perfectly neatly as soon as the alarm goes off, you are going to be more disciplined in the way you organise the rest of your day, because you are giving yourself a daily lesson that reinforces self-discipline. You will do things in the proper sequence, completing one task before moving onto the next, instilling order.   You will be calm, efficient, organised and reliable.

But if you press snooze, mess with your phone for 10 minutes, then shower, get dressed, have breakfast, and hurriedly make the bed just before you head out for the day, the daily lesson you are teaching yourself is that it is ok to put things off until the last minute.  You are teaching yourself to procrastinate, to become a person who misses work deadlines, turns up late when meeting friends, and is permanently stressed by poor time management.

And if you don‚Äôt make the bed at all?  Well, I‚Äôll let you work that one out for yourself.

I am a chronic procrastinator, and I‚Äôve always pressed snooze, but I think the Buddhists are right about the importance of daily habits, so I‚Äôm doing my best to reprogram my morning routine  now.

If you would like to share, what morning routines set you up right for the day?

I went to my (wonderful, supportive, but drinking) parents' house for a get-together we have yearly. It's one of my favorite times of the year, and always ALWAYS involves booze. Lots. I come from a tiny town replete with drinkers, and it's just baked into the culture. I wasn't even planning on going this year since I knew I'd be fighting like hell to stay sober, but I figured it would be a smaller, more toned-down celebration than usual this year after COVID.

I let my parents know beforehand that I wasn't drinking. Like I said, they were very supportive and proud of me. However, my mom has always walked the edge of normal person drinking, and she didn't elect to abstain with me as I had secretly hoped ( my dad doesn't really drink). I don't think she realized how hard it was going to be for me.

Luckily, my twin brother was there, also not drinking for different reasons (medical-related), which was also out-of-character for him. He knew about my choice and the reasons behind it, so I was able to talk to him and commiserate. That really saved me today. Because after I got there and the fridge was full of beer, and my older brother showed up and offered my husband a beer, and asked why I wasn't drinking, and... it was just all the exact things I was hoping to avoid. Not to imply these are terrible, enabling people. They just didn't know about the extent of my issues with it right now, and don't have the same problems with booze that I have.

Today I had a friend's birthday. Everyone was drinking, I had a slight twinge of nostalgia for the ""I dont know anyone here"" beer. You know, the one that would give me something to do with my hands and help ingratiate myself into an unfamiliar crowd. I aknowledged it and kept it moving.

Another faint twinge for the nice glass of wine to accompany my meal. It too, was fleeting.

After dinner, they all left to go to the bar and I drove home. Totally sober, not talking myself into stopping off at the liquor store for a ""couple"" more to keep my buzz going at home. I had a nice little evening. At this stage, it really is getting so much more simple. Drinking = negative outcomes, not drinking = positive outcomes. 

I also got word that my kid was accepted into an amazing school. The program has a 7am start, so I spent a good part of my day writing out schedules. You see, I no longer have to build my day around drinking so although it'll be tough going into a busy school year, it's just part of life. In addition to school for my kid, extracurriculars and club teams, I'm registered for my last semester of college. 4 classes was too much when I was drinking... I'm ""me"" again at work, I look forward to challenging projects and again, being in control there is amazing. I'm not overwhelmed by rough mornings or hurrying my work to leave to get a drink or ten.

It's such a quiet, less chaotic life. Tonight at bedtime, looking at my kid with clear eyes and knowing my kiddo is secure in the fact that mom will be there to read a book without slurring or worse, passing out. That mom will be awake and making coffee instead of asleep and yelling for quiet because her head hurts. I'm just filled with so much gratitude that I've committed to sticking it out through hard days. Every ugly sob early in was with it. Every blow up from being overwhelmed at being newly sober and *feeling* things. Every moment of gritting my teeth and talking myself down from just one drink to take the edge off. I understand that sobriety isn't linear and the path is different for everyone but this really is the point where I'm getting really comfortable with myself.

When we get together, there's usually some point when which we reminisce about the younger days and how stupid and clueless we were, where things went dark, and then out the other end.

Today we both came to a point where we realized the only thing that we can imagine worse than a full relapse into drinking, where it's cheap handles of Russian vodka straight out of the bottle; the only thing worse would be... moderate drinking.

To some that are reading, this may sound perplexing; as a full relapse is certainly a worst case scenario... Agony, suffering, darkness, despair. It is the hell we know.

But a seat with Satan himself would have to be at a bar that serves three light beers a day. A taste of the real thing, yet not the full body. A mere glimpse of the intoxication, yet really just an urge to sneeze that fades away painfully. Yes, a life of drinking just three beers a day would be unending, unwavering, perpetual torture.

Enough extra calories to keep the weight on. Enough alcohol to disrupt your sleep. Enough to cause health problems. Enough to keep it on your mind, every day, as you sip down your muted pilsner. Every day, for the rest of your life.

This, I assert, would be the ultimate torture.

This is for anyone reading who may be very early in on your journey, or perhaps considering that first step: Do not allow yourself to be tempted to take the road of ""moderation."" There is no joy, fulfillment, or reality in ""moderating""your alcohol. It is just a deeper level of hell, and then it's back ""up"" to a full relapse before you reach sobriety again. 

They say there is not enough booze in the universe to truly satisfy even one single alcoholic. Yet **exactly none** is just right. So, please: Enjoy a clear mind. A full heart. A healthy body. A fulfilled life. 

Do not drink with me tonight.",210,0

It turns out I don't have to drink or sleep to get that feeling. It's like an eight-year relapse just masked the idiot I was becoming.

TLDR- I may have wrongly accused someone and ruined the relationship. Soberly.

There was an old friend gently pushing me to chase a dream of mine. A first love, really. And it felt nice to talk to someone who had known who I used to be. Before all of the things I messed up. And I felt like taking steps towards that dream could be a great way to occupy the time and keep my eyes on the prize.

They asked an innocent question, and I brought up old drinking/drugging stuff that was paining me when it should have died ages ago. And what's more, the friend is sure they didn't do what I said they did. And I assured them that's what I told my friends at the time. And I think about it from time to time and it is always the same memory.

And now that they say it wasn't them...I'm doubting myself. Was I blaming the wrong person all these years? And have I just pushed away the person who was being my best champion right now? And without that gentle push from someone who cares, I don't think I have the courage to keep chasing the dream. I'm not going to drink this feeling away no matter how bad I want to. I just hope it doesn't last as long the others have. I can sit with it a day maybe two. I really don't want to reset that clock again.",7,1

In the past 365 I‚Äôve survived covid, solo-parented a toddler, worked full-time in healthcare even when daycare closed, lost some weight, lost two pets, adopted a new dog, grew and successfully killed a lawn, survived a major corporate merger, a boss from hell, going on my first date in years (on my four year soberversary no less) only to have it interrupted with news my best-friend of 20 years died in a car wreck that wasn‚Äôt his fault. 

But I didn‚Äôt drink.

My house is a wreck. I hate my job. I got unfit. 

But I didn‚Äôt drink.

Yes, there is more to sobriety than not drinking. 

Also- life is fucking hard. And not leaning on a poison for salvation is INCREDIBLY hard.

So if you relapsed recently. Get up. IWNDWYT

I got put on some beta blockers and they were all but sorted out for several years. After a few years out of college, I basically ended up being a binge drinker drinking a bottle of wine and a couple shots \~2 - 3 times per week for the first 2 years, then upping it to 2 bottles per night \~4 times a week for the last 2 years. If I had an evening event that had me out all evening, I would go to the event sober, stop by the liquor store on the way home and basically shotgun a bottle before derping out on stupid youtube videos for an hour, having a whiz, and going to bed.  


I really began my sobriety journey right around July 1. I've had a grand total of 6 beers scattered across August over a meal, but am thinking to stop even that. My heart was chugging away just like normal up until I quit drinking (it's actually the primary reason I quit). After a 4-day binge, my heart felt suuuuper freaky the sober day after. It felt like the beat intensity was bouncing up and down, I was missing heart beats, it felt like he sensation you get riiiight before a muscle starts cramping, etc. I went to the ER - perfectly normal everything. They sent me home with a squeaky clean bill of health and advised me to check with a cardiologist.  


A month after I (mostly) quit and my heart beat intensity is a LOT more stable (a little bit of fluctuation yet, but not much) and the sensation of a 'pre-cramp' is gone. However, I still feel like I'll skip a beat a time or two every night while going to sleep (haven't been able to catch it on my 'mini-EKG' thing though). I also get just a couple seconds of arrhythmia maybe 2 times a week or so, which is new. Previously, my arrhythmia would be for several minutes during some intense exercise/activity. A couple weeks ago, I had, what seemed like, very low blood sugar if i hadn't eaten for a while. Arrhythmia that lasted for a minute or two, light headed, shaking, confusion, etc.... That would have been about 3 weeks after I quit, so doubting it was directly withdrawals, but more just my body trying to figure out what the heck to do without all of the sugar I used to dump into it. I'm taking it cautious, but I believe that's behind me now.  


I do have a cardiologist scheduled for later this month, so I'm looking forward to that. What are anyone else's stories like regarding heart issues and getting sober?",5,0

Once we started talking it made it so clear how his mental health had taken a toll on him and facilitated his drinking. He wasn‚Äôt drunk when we talked but definitely hungover and just looked like hell. Our conversation was a surreal experience for me because I was fortunate to be living with my parents when I had the worst of my addiction. We discussed some treatment options since I am a therapist and know a lot of places nearby (I didn‚Äôt give him my agency for ethical reasons) and gave him options.

This disease takes us to dark places. And it‚Äôs not the drinking itself. That‚Äôs such a small part of it IMO.

One of you asked how I‚Äôve done it, I figured it might be best to put it in the edit. 

1. I relapsed after a little less than 3 months in 2018. An absolutely shit 2ish years followed.

2. When I got sober-curious again at the beginning of 2020, I wasn‚Äôt ready to stop drinking yet, but I was starting to fear for my health because I was spiraling hard. I had heard about a book called Quit Like a Woman (by Holly Whitaker); I bought the audiobook. That made me *want* to quit, I was so inspired by the author. I bought more audiobooks, including Russell Brand‚Äôs *Recovery*. I listened to sober stories every day, every commute, every time I was in the car. Find your sober heroes!

3. I started following all kinds of sober accounts on IG. 

4. I said ‚Äúpoison‚Äù to myself every time I saw liquor for like‚Ä¶a while. This actually really helped me change my perception of alcohol. I don‚Äôt allow myself to romanticize it; it‚Äôs fucking poison. It‚Äôs a lot less attractive that way. When I learned about how glorified alcohol is in media/our culture and how it actually makes depression/anxiety worse, it was much easier to avoid it.

5. I always have fizzy beverages around - I love super spicy ginger beers, fruit juices, kombucha, and sparkling waters. San Pellegrino‚Äôs limonata soda is sooo good, super tart :)

6. Tea, tea, tea. 

7. Therapy, once a week. 

8. I took up crochet, put cute stickers in my planner, doodled, and wrote. One reason I drank was to dull my hyperactivity. Having something to do with my hands is really important for me!

9. I avoided events with alcohol, and people that are heavy drinkers. Yeah, my friends were bummed that I didn‚Äôt come out as much, but real friends will understand and support you. 

10. One day at a time. One hour, one breath at a time. 


I‚Äôm sure there will be hard times ahead on this journey but I‚Äôm just gonna keep doing what works :)

I have been thinking lately about my alcohol usage and how it is slightly increasing. I never drank as a teenager and was very introverted, this was fine for me. I was alone most of the time on my computer doing my own thing.

I like being extroverted and having energy for things, but I do not like the fact that I am getting this only from drinking. So my question is, do you guys have any tips for getting energy from more healthier and natural sources?

I used to be a heavy drinker for 12-15 years, not consistently but it got worse as the years passed. 

Anyway last June I reached a low point and decided it was time to get help so I went to rehab.. I stayed sober (and still am) but due to work I could'nt make it to the rehab as often and eventually they didn't give me appointments. I continued my sobriety on my own and I am doing pretty good.. Finally doing something with my life. 

 I still get urges to drink from time to time but nothing I couldn't handle. Problem is ever since quiting I ve cut out all my friends and only go out with my gf. A friend of mine asked me to go to a bar to hang out but I am scared of relapsing so I refused. 

Does this get better and will I be able to handle bars without drinking or is it something I should avoid completely just to be safe? 

Also since I didn't manage my sobriety in a rehab program do you think I should still go to one so I can get the knowledge (what to avoid etc) to keep sober long-term?

It's a bit of a long vent, I'm hurt and angry...

Tl;Dr: My friend/accountabilibuddy went rogue on me and is now drunkenly picking at my resolve. I'm not falling for it, but it's already difficult without this garbage.



I am (was) an every day drinker, and am so sick of the side effects of my habit/addiction. All the time and money wasted, all the dumb decisions, etc. I had actually forgotten what waking up without a hangover feels like....

My friend and I agreed to do a sober August (which I personally hope to continue well beyond August), and both started on the first. From the get-go, she's been looking for any excuse to have ""a beer"" almost every day since. 

I've been fine with the one-sidedness of support (even though it drags me down into temptation) until this morning when she mentions she's going to have drinks at our old regular bar with a friend. My response boiled down to: ""Whatever. I thought we were supposed to be in this together, but you're a grown-ass woman. I'm seeing this through regardless. You can always have any non-alcoholic beverage at the bar"".

So of course, she tries to flip it on me that I'm being a judgy dick, when in reality I just called her out for breaking our promise, without resorting to anger, name-calling, etc.

About a half hour ago, she proceeded to drunk dial me from the bar and starts slurring the words: ""Even though you disrespected me---"" and I immediately ended the call. The absolute gall of that statement had my anger peaking.

Since then, she's been texting me that her friend needs help, so-and-so from the bar says they miss me, and various messages about why women drink.

I don't feel angry anymore. I'm honestly close to being in tears and feel pathetic. The person who was supposed to support me is just taking jabs and trying to drag me back to where I'm struggling to stay away from. Going from drinking every single day to not at all hasn't been easy, I don't need this shit in my life.

To end on a positive note, [I have finally gone back to the gym yesterday](https://youtu.be/uYR7O1pGZmA), and am riding my bike around town. I already feel a lot healthier, and it's only been less than a week. I'm seeing this through and getting my life back in control.

My original intention and post (https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ozexy3/day_05/) was to cut back and eventually get sober. Looking back now, I see what I did! (without even realizing it at the time). I was trying to get an OK from someone that it was ok to just cut back and continue drinking instead of putting the work in and dealing with my issues. The funny things we do without even knowing. So thank you all for pushing me to go all in and never give me the confirmation that it's ok to just cut back (because we all know where that leads). To avoid any future complications I also poured out all my liquor as I've been know to go some benders. 

Last night was pretty tough. Friday and Saturday nights have always been my reward for making it through the week. These were MY nights, MY nights to drink as much as I wanted and stay up as late as I wanted (Great father material huh) and not worry about watching the kids the following day or even give any thought how they might feel that their dad just sleeps all day every Saturday and Sunday and is grumpy all the time etc (the fun stuff that comes along with being hung over) - As a background my wife works on the weekend.

My ""routine"" is so engraved, if I wander from it I feel off. My old routine was to head to the liquor store and pick up 8-12 beers, put them in the freezer at 8PM and then starting gaming and pounding beers around 9 PM ending my night around 1 or 2.
So last night after work I went to the grocery store instead (trying to keep the routine but swap out items that don't include alcohol). I picked up some food for the weekend, a huge chocolate cake slice (as a reward for making it this far) and 2 12 packs of my favorite Seltzer water flavors; AKA good with booze. (On my next trip I am going to grab different flavors that I haven't had) Ate my cake when I got home and felt great and empowered that I actually can do this. 8PM rolls around and I stick 6 cans in the freezer. 9PM rolls around and I get out my trusty old pint glass and grab 2 cans and put the rest in the fridge. (note to everyone Seltzer water freezes much faster than beer). I fire up League of Legends (video game) and pour my slushy Lime Bubbly! water.

As expected it was not the same. After 4 waters down, I just felt full and bored of the game. Decided to call it a night around 1130 or so I thought. Since I've been honest about everything I might as well continue the trend. Last night was weird. I was in a place I've never been to and ever expected to be in. It was an emotional roller coaster, I had all these feelings of despair, failure and impending doom; really wrestling with my demons. If I had not poured out the Vodka and Gin earlier in the day I definitely would have drank. It was really bizarre. I am not a crier, but last night I was a crier. At some point I was asking for help from deceased grandparents for the strength to do this.

Around 1 or 2 AM I was finally able to take a step back and really process my thoughts and feelings. I heard the train departing this place and gladly jumped aboard. I started to realize these painful emotions and feelings were here to help me grow and potentially just part of the process. (Hoping I don't any other mental illness that were masked by my alcoholism). I spent the rest of the early morning reading through all the posts here finding comfort in that there is hope. So many of you have shared your truths, failures and stories.

I am not sure what today and tonight will bring, but I am hoping it will be easier then yesterday. I've spent the past few hours processing last night (and my life) and I am going to make it. I do not want to go back to that place or have to think about the what ""if's"" moving forward.

For context, I quit drinking at 27 and moved to another city. I lasted an amazing two years and decided I should try drinking responsibly. It didn't work obviously and there was a hectic three year stretch where I quit for several months a few times but ended up going through heavy anxiety and ended up at rock bottom. The past two years has been amazing and my life has never been better. Unfortunately my mental health has been at a breaking point over the past month and I almost slipped into a mental breakdown. These breakdowns basically mean days of heavy anxiety that are crippling.   


For more context: I am a musician and it has been my dream to pursue a life of performing. It's the only thing I've found that I truly love doing in terms of making money. All of my jobs have been in the service industry or self contracting gig jobs like Uber/Uber Eats.   


I fully quit playing music before getting sober, convincing myself that the pursuit was pointless and ending up pawning my guitar for money. The week I decided to get sober again, I received a message from someone I had not spoken with in several years to come out and play music. Through that I met my SO and learned bass guitar to create more opportunities. The gigs have been going really well and I'm having more work than ever, but lately my mental health has taken a turn for the worse.  


It took several weeks of high stress/anxiety to realize that I was not focusing on my own health. I thought that because I spent so much time unable to be a part of the music scene, that I needed to be out on the town on a nightly basis to meet other musicians and find opportunities. As you may expect the lifestyle is fully intertwined with alcoholism and drug use. On top of all of that, my friends are very selective of the music they like to go see, and many times I'm out at a show by myself around heavy drinking. Other times I would take my SO out or meet her in the tourist area of town with total chaos in terms of binge drinking.   


I went through a breakdown a few years ago and never got help. When I came out of it, I turned to alcohol and hit rock bottom. Like many of you, I masked a lifetime of anxiety and depression with alcoholism. While going through the past few weeks of heavy anxiety, I finally made the choice to get help.  


I reached out to an advocacy group to find a therapist and I have a screening on Monday. This will be my first time trying therapy and I can't wait to have someone to help me on a weekly basis. I also reached out to a friend to take me to my first AA meeting. I got on meet up . com and signed up for some sober events to try and meet other people like me. MOST IMPORTANTLY I've decided that the bar scene is not for me anymore. I will go perform and come home after, but I need a much needed break from the nightlife scene.   


The choice to focus on myself and get help as done wonders to ease my anxiety. Just seeing a future of support is such a relief. I'm ready to do this right because I will not be drinking anymore period. I love this community and read your posts daily to stay sober. IWNDWYT.",30,1

So I (27F) was raised in a cult. I was abused. A lot. By my parents, my general family, the run of the mill abuse from cult life. You get it.  If any of this stuff is triggering for you, stop reading for your mental health.

My father and I have done a lot to work through our issues. He has learned to respect my boundaries and is now a regular part of my life and lives a mile away. My mother, on the other hand...I mean, she doesn't hit me anymore. But I don't live with her, so ya know. She lives a little over an hour away. We talk mostly through Facebook messenger and video calls. She has untreated mental illness: Bipolar with delusions and paranoia, and buckets of anxiety and unresolved trauma. The works.

My mother is still in the cult. My dad was kind of just a bystander to the cult life, and they divorced 16 years ago, so he's pretty apathetic to religion in general. Cult is very doomsday, the government is trying to kill you, weird rules, control tactics, fear mongering, etc etc. So she's fallen into a medical and government conspiracy rabbit hole. 

I've responded to her TikTok videos regarding human takeover imminent doom it's a trap shenanigans with credible links that disprove it and a little personal narrative to help explain what the studies mean. I'm not super educated. I've just taken a few years of science focused college courses and learned how to find and understand primary sources and research papers and stuff for school. Super easy after writing thousands and thousands of words. 

Then she brought up my brother nearly dying about 23 years ago from a super deadly disease and insisting it was caused by a vaccine he'd gotten like four years prior. So I did the usual, found credible sources to show actual causes of the disease and protective measures to lower the risk of becoming infected with it. Then I acknowledged her trauma from being blamed by doctors for my brother getting sick and told her it was in no way her fault, and they were full of it.

You may have put it together at this point that I've been heavily parentified (mostly by my mother), and I have a strong impulse for ""helper/caretaker"" behaviors. I am allowing my mother to violate my boundaries repeatedly with discussion of both her culty stuff and medical propaganda that can be easily disproven. Most of the stuff about the disease that almost killed him, I knew at like 10 years of age immediately after he fell ill when I decided to write a paper about it in 5th grade to work through the trauma of seeing my baby brother almost die. The disease, if you're wondering is meningococcemia (commonly known as bacterial meningitis).

SO now we get to the real point of this whole post. After I expended all of this mental and emotional energy in talking to my mother that I should have placed elsewhere, I began completely sobbing. Loudly. Nearly vomiting from my nose clogging up so intensely. Then I began typing out a message to her about my boundaries, the abuse she's caused me to suffer, the fact that she's never been a mother to me, and what I need her to do and stop doing in order to remain in my life.

Y'all, I just couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't get pulled into my mother's delusions and lack of respect for my boundaries and my trauma. And before anyone says, ""Oh, be nice to her. She's your mother, and she's obviously sick blkajsdgpoiyWHEPO;TKLGHAS;LIFDGJ."" I know she's sick. I know. I lived with it. I have tried so many times to get her to get help. My husband works in mental health, and I'm now studying psychology. Like, I know. You can't force someone into treatment. And please don't tell me that from what I've shared that you see no abuse. Please. Like, It would take putting freaking screenshots up to show the sophistication of gaslighting and emotional abuse that she utilizes when she's lucid enough to mask coherent thought.

I'm just so tired. I feel like I've never had a mom. And now I'm navigating sobriety, and my trauma isn't being drowned in alcohol, so I can feel it. I'm having to work through all of the things I've been through, and the things people have done to me. And I'm getting a hysterectomy in less than two weeks. And it's so much. 

My husband and kids are amazing and so helpful and supportive, but I wish a had a mom. I wish someone would come hold me and make me feel better. But I've got this person instead that just kinda looks like me  and  fed me sometimes and hurts me and doesn't care enough about me to do anything to stop it.

I'm hurting so badly right now, but IWNWYT.",40,3

There have been plenty of ups followed with plenty of downs. I had a bit of of an epiphany yesterday in that this familiar pain/sadness started to take up space in my mind and body. I almost immediately had the urge to drink. But, instead I played the tape forward and gave myself a pep talk and instead of numbing my pain I embraced it. I decided to listen to some music that helps me deal with being sad and let myself just feel it. Fast forward to today and I was reflecting back on yesterday and I thought to myself that wasn‚Äôt my depression that was grief that I was experiencing. And why grief? Why now? I mean sure in the beginning that‚Äôs normal. But guess what!? I am finding that it is still normal to grieve the life that I once knew. I read this sub daily and have been inspired by the vulnerability, raw honesty, and courage that exists within the daily posts. And aside from rambling (sorry) I just wanted to say that it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre sad and you find yourself grieving a life that you once loved. I don‚Äôt know why I thought that once I hit a certain number of days sober that my grief would suddenly just poof and go away. It doesn‚Äôt. And it‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre struggling. I struggle too because for the longest time I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with any emotion be it negative or positive. I turned to the bottle like so many of us do‚Ä¶.

Now on day #5, I have eaten more today than I did Monday through Thursday together... I had no idea I was starving myself so bad, the booze kinda numbed the hunger away.

Now I'm eating like a horse, my body is probably trying to recover or prepare for the next week long binge, which hopefully won't happen again.

I can almost sleep normally again without alcohol! Got a solid 5 hours last night, 4 of which were continuous!


I was really on the deep end, 700ml vodka per day for weeks, except for the days I literally could not force it down.
This has been going off and on (mostly on) for the better part of a year. 

Thank God I felt so ridiculously awful last Tuesday. Otherwise I probably would've went and bought yet another bottle to finish.

Today, miraculously, I have no physical cravings for alcohol, only mental but they're manageable. 

It was hard to not go buy more today, it's Saturday and I thought ""You've been doing so well this week, you should celebrate with vodka"".

I was almost 3 years sober and gave into the wine temptation. I had a short lived blip but started my counting over for my own growth (though I still consider April 13th 2018 my big aha moment). Since becoming sober my family's financial situation has done a 180, I have a good career I am happy in, I cut out some toxic friends and made others, I have worked to cultivate a deeper connection with my children and husband, I have really gotten into my knitting and I am big into fitness, I make time to read, life is good...

But one area that still confounds me and I have trouble putting up boundaries with, is family. I was adopted as a newborn into a family. My father died of cirrhosis of the liver when I was 12 and my mom has been a workaholic and enabler since I can remember. She got remarried when I was 16 which is a whole essay in itself but in a nutshell she married and takes care of another alcoholic who has never had a job in the 23 years they have been together. I despise him. He is awful.

I found both my biological mother and father over the last handful of years and well... I am just glad I didn't have high expectations.

It is very obvious to me that I have abandonment issues and keep people at an arm's length and that is something I have been working hard to end but it runs deep and is obviously one of the reasons I turned to drinking.

Back to my family, I had to cut my mom and her husband out of my life for a couple years but then felt guilty about it because of my three young children. I have basically zero connection with my mom because she has never put me first and I have a lot of resentment that lies there which I believe is founded. I have tried working through it and to let go of the image of having a good mom but it is just painful. She will never know the true me because she doesn't try. And any of the times I've had to have a real heart to heart conversation with her it just fails. She is incapable of emotion. When I was in high school I was dealing with an eating disorder and had a lot of anger (this is around the time she decided to marry her alcoholic husband and bring him into our home without so much as asking how I felt about it). I asked her if she would come to therapy with me and she agreed but the moment it got challenging during our first visit she walked out of the door and wouldn't return. Which is basically how things have been my entire life. She is just closed off and blames her circumstances on everyone else.

While I have her in my life to be in my children's life, I don't even really know what good that is doing because she doesn't make many attempts at being a beacon in their life.

Anyway I really have no idea where I'm going with this post except that I am trying to have healthy boundaries in every area of my life but the family area just stumps me because I feel like I am being an awful person putting up hard and fast boundaries with her. She is 70 and I know she will not live forever but I also am aware that she is a very big trigger for me in my life and makes me feel bad about myself.

So if anyone else is going through something similar I would love to know how you put up boundaries and what has worked for you. Thanks for reading my novel. I am basically a lurker here and appreciate all of the wonderful wisdom passed around so I thought I would write what is on my heart this morning.

Any tips on managing diet and workout routine in this early phase?

The key for me was finding support and getting help, and I find continuous enrichment in reaching out and helping others.  When March 2020 rolled around, I had many reasons to get a bit glum, not the least of which was being sheltered-in-place and isolated from fellow alcoholics, particularly those needing support and help.  Then it occurred to me that some folks here on Reddit might be looking for help (and I'd almost decided to tune out Reddit as there are a few communities that are ... you know, kind of odd and/or toxic?)

For new sober people I wanted to share my thoughts about my first AA meeting. I did an online meeting on Day 3 because I was really struggling to get past cravings and anxiety. It was great and let me tell you why.

I‚Äôm considered ‚Äòhigh functioning‚Äô which only means I hide the whirlwind of shit in my life far better than most people. I own a home, recently got promoted, and have a family. 

The truth is‚Ä¶ In the evenings I was drinking 1-1.5 bottles of wine every night for about 3 years. I was hungover almost every day, dealt with horrible stomach pain and intestinal issues, had high blood pressure, an unhappy liver, and had put on 30 lbs in 1.5 years. I also had severe anxiety and depression and used alcohol as a way to ignore the parts of my life that needed maintenance and to ignore the worry that my drinking was causing my husband and my kids. Doesn‚Äôt sound so high functioning to me.

I say all of this because I didn‚Äôt know if AA was for me because I didn‚Äôt have withdrawals, haven‚Äôt been in trouble for drinking, and don‚Äôt fit that stereotypical alcoholic person that most people think of.

Guys, it‚Äôs for me. It was calm and supportive with absolutely zero judgment. We chatted about our relationship with alcohol and what we hoped to change and what had already changed. And for the first time ever‚Ä¶ I was honest. I‚Äôve been afraid to tell everyone: my husband, my friends, my doctor. With this group there is no more hiding my drinking or thoughts or fears. These people had lived my struggles and I didn‚Äôt feel alone. 

While AA may not be a daily thing for me, I‚Äôll be attending this online group during their weekly meetings and will try an in person meeting or 2 over the next few weeks. I hope some of my newly sober friends here will also reach out to see if it works for them.

Even when you wake up at 530 on a Saturday morning because a scary cyst is itching like f'ing crazy and you can't go back to bed OR itch it. 

I feel like I'm on the cusp of that really great stuff you get after not drinking for a while. I know I'm not in the clear just yet....but I have successfully had date night, a bad day, a great day, an anxiety-filled day, tended to my husband's bad day, and gone out to eat multiple times all without drinking. 

Navigating those times are always the most difficult for me. 

The first time I quit drinking....the first 30 days was so hard. It was constantly in the back of my mind and making me irritable. 

This time I wasn't nearly drinking as much - just the same frequency with bouts of very heavy drinking every other/few weekends. Like drinking an entire bottle of Hendrick's making mojitos because it felt fun and festive....and then buying more to hide the fact that I drank the whole bottle. That's over 100 bucks just on one weekend. Ridiculous. 

...then of course, nursing that hangover over multiple days - possibly all week...and lightly binging the next weekend to try to ease out of it and still have fun. Ugh. 

I don't miss that. 

I'm nearly at 2 weeks and I feel like I'm just about past the point I was after the first 30 days a while back. I'm enjoying myself. I'm sleeping better. I don't have to worry about taking Tylenol or ibuprofen.

I resisted, thank goodness, though really the cravings were offset (as in, I'll plan a relapse day once the crop is dry and go ham on everything then). This was the first craving this stretch where I was this close to agreeing with the addict brain (sneaky mofo). 

These last few weeks have been amazing. I've never felt more empowered to make changes and grow in my life. The personal autonomy and capability I've been experiencing is only growing and I know in a year (if I make it) or more it will be exponentially higher. 

So to be so close to giving that up, to letting the devil take the wheel once again? That scared me. It scared me how easy it would be to relinquish my hard fought empowerment. It scared me how hard it was to remember how important it was to me. It scared me how quickly I could revert to being weak, to letting someone or something else decide how my life is gonna be.

I'm not sure if I'll be as strong tomorrow as I feel today. I hope I will, and every day after that until I've squashed all the cravings and truly won my life back. But I just wanted to make this as a reminder to myself of what I'd be giving up if I did give in. It's not ""just for today"". Its not ""only one time"". Its letting something else take charge of my body and mind and facing the consequences of that.

At least I didn't behave in a terrible way or blow up any relationships. Didn't drive drunk, didn't fight any cops. Didn't fb while drunk or drunk text. 

I've been in therapy for a few weeks now. I know I've already hit on some painful things. Some horribly anxiety inducing things, and I flew off the handle and drank myself into a sodden blob. I was even day drinking, from the moment I woke up.

But this therapy is amazing. It's called somatic experiencing. And for the first time, I'm getting a handle on how to deal with pain and massive emotion by recognizing what's happening, and actually being able to release the emotion and tension before it hits critical mass.

I was dealing with it by just repressing and refusing to look at anything even remotely painful. Pasted a smile on my face and said everything's fine and I have nothing to complain about. That worked out about as well as can be expected. 

I've done a lot of therapy before, and they always talk about catching triggers before they happen, but now the how. And they don't explain what to watch for when it seems like they are hair triggers. 

Anyway, here I am back on day 4 or something. I reset my badge. Hopefully I did it right. 

Here I am, I feel beat up, frightened that I may never get over this, hopeful I've finally found some real life working tools, sad I've wasted so much of my life. 

And IWNDWYT

Alcohol is a strong delusion.","I have changed. I feel strong, determinate, reliable, unselfish, ready. My core beliefs about myself have changed. I see for certain that I am like this.

I was twisted and weakened in 1000s of ways by alcohol. My mind had changed my core beliefs about myself, based on the evidence. I had gathered it in my weakened state, not only when I was drunk, but most importantly around it as well, it weakens the body and mind for weeks to come. I felt certain I was like that, and I was like that, in a weakened state.

My beliefs about the world have also changed. They were created by my mind around the evidence I had gathered. The dopamine release had created a web of relevance around alcohol, the people, places, situations, opinions. They felt important, that has vanished into thin air, not by decision but by the missing emotion. It was only the dopamine fooling my brain. It made other things lose their emotion, significance, and among that their web of relevance. It was a strong delusion that prevented me from connecting with the real world, real life.

Thinking about it now there‚Äôs no other point when it started than when I started to pour it into my mouth in my youth.

I am not weak anymore, neither delusional about myself or the world. Alcohol weakens in 1000s of ways, it‚Äôs not possible to avoid it, it‚Äôs chemistry and biology. Leaving it makes me stronger in 1000s of ways.

Two months sober and I‚Äôm still getting stronger, I want to see who that person is!

Stay sober and not delusioned about yourself and the world. Then you are strong as you truly are! ‚ú®

I wanted to share.,"Alcohol is selfish. To drink alcohol is selfish. It robs you of life and energy. It makes you less aware of yourself, actions, thoughts, and it diminishes your being. 

You aren't there (as present) as much for partner, family, and friends. It makes you less patient and have less resilience in life. The people close to you need your time and love, just as much as your inner being needs love and care. 

Your focus is scattered. You're in a haze. What if you were meant for more than this. I believe you can rise above this. You could change if you wanted to. Change for yourself and those close to you. Alcohol is honestly not living your best life is it. 

I have found that there is no such thing as moderation when it comes to alcohol. I'll just have a little turns into a lot more than you planned on. 

Why are you scared of losing something that only makes your life harder and more diluted?

I am thankful that we have the ability to change and grow. It's funny how most change is good or can be if we learn from it, yet we push and pull against it. Thinking it'll be uncomfortable and won't feel good. 

But guess what? Are you feeling good right now? Is what you're doing in your daily life making you happy? Are you with people that make you feel good and show you that they care? I think that we can live life without our addictions, instead turning to more healthy hobbies and passions.¬†

The first step is being aware of our addiction and wanting something to change. It doesn't have to be right now but setting an intention to quit is a good start. If it takes a week.. a month.. a year.. at least you know you want something to change. 

I have been slowly but surely realizing alcohol has only caused me anxiety, tension, and unneeded stress.  I'm not able to do the things I enjoy when I've been drinking too much. It limits me immensely. I want to drink more to feel better.. but it just brings me down more. There is definitely a reason why alcohol is classified as a depressant. 

I always thought it was fun to drink or that it was a cool thing to do as a teenager and in my early 20's. It's not. Just like smoking cigarettes is not cool. Drinking is a scapegoat for our problems and our worries. In the end it makes everything more problematic. 

You're stuck in this loop that never ends like groundhog day. I'd like to step out of this programmed reality. What do you think? Wouldn't you like to step out as well? 

I'm not sure I'll ever be free of all of the things that have their hooks in me but I can try and at least see what they really are for myself. Not what people boast them up to be or what we think they do for us.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It¬¥s Saturday and my last day this time around. I¬¥ll be hanging around, and if you want to host the check-in for a week, let me know! It¬¥s so humbling and inspiring to see each and every one of you check in, one day one, or day one bazillion, sharing hopes and fears, struggles and victories. Thank you!!

It¬¥s been a while since I celebrated milestones. In the beginning I counted every one - a week, ten days (I got a lot of those), a month, palindromes, nerdy ones. They helped me stay motivated. Then, as I closed in on one year, I was bummed. What should I count now? The goal was reached, every counter would start over, just with ""one year and"" first. I struggled. I had to make a choice - keep counting, or take alcohol off the table for good, out of time.

When I took alcohol off the table, being sober became a lot easier. It wasn¬¥t something I had to decide every day, it was something I was. The choice is already made, I just have to follow through. It wasn¬¥t easy, and I¬¥m still drawn some times, but it gets a whole lot better, I promise.

And I still look at the good ol¬¥ badge. This week I raised half an eyebrow seeing that it was one thousand plus one year. That¬¥s pretty neat! Two rock solid milestones that I never dared to even dream about! But I forgot to comment on my own post and then it was 1000 + 365 + one day - and it struck me, like I¬¥ve thought so many times, that *every day is worthy a celebration*.

We walk the same path, and while some have walked a few steps and others have walked far, we are all one step from the ditch. If we fall, we get up again, on this trail there are lots of helping hands. By being sober we choose life. We choose presence, relations, health, future. Over and over again, step by step, day by day. Now *that* is pretty neat!

I will not drink with you today!",181,0

I ran out of volunteers for Saturday Shares, so it's time once again for me to put the call out.

Please ask yourself something:

- Are you stoked about your sobriety and want the world to know?
- Are you a bit of a karma hog and want lots of upvotes?
- Do you think your journey in sobriety is interesting?
- Do you like getting lots of comments like ""thank you so much!"" and ""this is me!!!!!"" on your posts?
- Do you like feeling less alone?
- Do you like helping others feel less alone?
- Do you love /r/stopdrinking and want some way to give back?
- Do you think that there's a chance that maybe just one Sobernaut might get some benefit from hearing about your own experiences?

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions (I answered yes to all of them, no shame), then do I have a deal for you!!!!

It's called the Saturday Share.  Each Saturday, we here at SD aim to feature a fellow Sobernaut's journey in sobriety, highlighting:

- Some background on their drinking
- What lead to them to get sober
- How their life has been in sobriety

I love reading about peoples' journeys in sobriety.  I can relate to what I read.  I am reminded of my own failures and victories.  I feel grateful that a fellow Sobernaut opened up and shared something so that I could feel less alone.  I get to better know a fellow Sobernaut.

I need volunteers.  I need people to step up and share their journeys with me and the rest of the community. Since I last asked for volunteers,

Blood tests always within normal range(one recent) and a normal upper right quadrant ultrasound (4 months ago). Not even a fatty liver. 

Before my first blood test 6 months ago, I cut way back. I decided I wanted to quit drinking my life away and get healthy in all aspects of life. I was sober for a little over a month. Did the whole dry January thing, got my ultra sound results, and fell back on the wagon. I still tried to limit my consumption, though I'll admit a few days were a little heavy. 

I quit again about a week ago. I'm noticing visible blue veins under my eyes. My eyes themselves have been blood shot every day for about year (doctor told me try some eye drops >.>). Anyone have anything similar? Will my eyes ever look normalish for my age again? Think my doctor is whack and I should get a second opinion on the biliary/renal health?

**That**, to *me*, was the toughest part of sobriety.

It's when I had to change my lifestyle, people/places/things, go to meetings and make new sober friends even when I felt awkward, and even lock myself in my bedroom during some weekend nights to prevent myself from going out to drink.

At 2,000 days, sobriety has comfortably become a priority in my life.

If you're at 2 days or 2 weeks and you're debating about whether to stay on the wagon, why not stick with it a big longer? You've already put in this time, and we all know how difficult it's been. If you can just get past the initial hump, hang out here at SD or find support groups/counseling/or other forms of help, you can watch your badge grow every single day. 

You can achieve anything you want to. And you've already taken that first step - because you're here with us - and we're happy to have you and support you!

Long time lurker and finally 5 days sober. I started out about 7 years ago. At first it was a couple of shots a night or a beer or two and slowly progressed to 4 shots, then half a 750ml bottle and some days a quarter or the full bottle. Vodka was my poison of choice and not getting hangovers didn‚Äôt help either. 

I drank daily with very few to no breaks in between. I lost days and weeks and the worst is that I lost out on memories with my partner. Last year I started to take shots before work as well. I‚Äôm sure it was depression mixed with a history of alcoholism that runs in my family but I kept telling myself it is what it is. 

Enough is enough though. I want to reclaim my life and learn how to live life without it. I want to remember my nights and weekends without blackout passing out. I know it‚Äôs only my 5th day but I‚Äôm already sleeping better, my body is feeling better and the mental fog is gone. 

I do realize I need help though in living my life sober because I would look forward to drinking to have fun and enjoy my life but now I need to re-learn that being sober. 

I love that this sub exists because all your stories, even though I didn‚Äôt act sooner, helped me get the courage to stop drinking. 

I‚Äôll continue to be strong for myself and those around me and hopefully will learn to navigate the world again without the poison that was slowly killing me.

There were so many days where I woke up in the morning, poured myself a glass or 4 of wine, went back to sleep, woke up at lunchtime to sit with my husband, had another glass or 4, went back to sleep, woke up to cook dinner, started drinking while I cooked, and went back to bed as soon as I could. All that ‚Äúsleep‚Äù and I was beyond exhausted all the time.

Anyhow, four days ago the thought popped into my head ‚Ä¶ this is NOT what I want for myself. I‚Äôve left the last of the box in my fridge. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôd feel a pang seeing an empty spot where it always sits. 

I‚Äôve been doing really good. Very mild headaches the first couple of days. I‚Äôm not sleeping well but what‚Äôs new. No cravings. 

For now I‚Äôm focusing on drinking water, taking my antidepressant (used to skip that until I had withdrawals so bad I had to take one) and keeping up with my vitamins and skincare. Oh and a month ago I found a gym that will let me come work out in the off hours so it‚Äôs less COVID risk. Maybe soon I can figure out what it is I DO want for myself.

I work in a medical facility and when one of my coworkers was commenting on this one patient's behavior and my boss said he ""is an addict"". It just really rubbed me the wrong way, especially her tone of voice. Like that explained everything and that addicts are terrible.

As someone who works in healthcare it is also very important for us (and everyone really) to use person first language, to not define someone by their disability or medical condition. My boss could have easily said that pt has struggled with heroin addiction but instead defined him as an addict.

It bothers me on such a personal and professional level that she made that comment.

I am gay and am well aware people will judge you completely for just one facet of your life, but I have a lot more baggage with the word ""addict"" and it stings, especially since I know it can prevent people struggling with addiction from getting help as they are faced scorn, judgement and shame from others when they try.

It went from a class of wine a night to drinking vodka and gin til I fall asleep every night. I do wait until 5-6pm to drink so I guess I've used that as an excuse to avoid admitting that I have a problem. I've tried to drink less but I can't sleep unless I've drank so much I can't keep my eyes open anymore. I can't even stay up past like 9pm, but then I'm tossing and turning all night too. My Fitbit shows me restless like 50+ times a night even after I've drank myself to sleep. 

So I've got PTSD, depression... and I'm pretty sure that's the root cause for my sleeping problems and drinking. But I've also got major anxiety too so I avoid going to get therapy and stuff. There's literally only one place in my town for it and I've been there before and they weren't helpful. But even thinking about calling them or going there to get back in seems impossible for me to do. So I don't know if therapy is possible for me right now, but I want to stop drinking and need advice how I could accomplish that.

I never drank at all before the past few years or used drugs. I still don't use drugs but some stuff happened (hence the PTSD, depression, anxiety) and I turned to wine to feel better. Then turned to vodka.. and so on. 

Lately I've been telling myself I'm going to drink one glass of wine and one or two vodka drinks and that's it. But it always turns into one more, and another... until I pass out and I'm awake 2 hours later. So willing myself to ween off hasn't been successful..

I'm on day three. I went to my first rehab 15 years ago. At the time, I was mostly using an over the counter substance because it was easier to obtain and conceal from friends and authority figures. I felt very cool among others and began a personal dedication to being the most fucked up one in the room. I didn't feel a lot to be proud of but this was something I could work towards.

I was introduced to the concepts of recovery at that time, at a young age. In the rehab, a kid asked me if I was gonna go back out. I didn't really know, but I kinda wanted to. When arriving off the bus back in town, I popped into the CVS and stole my stuff, then went home and overdosed with that and alcohol and ended up hospitalized. I think that's a common thing that many people like us can relate to.

These things still make me proud. I don't know if that's a productive viewpoint. I think a healthier motivation for the stories is to provide a sense of togetherness for people who feel very alone.

Over time I moved to primarily alcohol. It's a nasty drug, I don't care what anyone says. At least, it is the way I use it, and have often seen it used. I've always been opportunistic about substance abuse. First, it was easy because I had lots of party friends to use it with, then it was easy because I didn't need anyone else to get it. That was a long and drawn out, painful progression. And I'm not the worst by far, I'm not so tough.

My usage has been interspersed with brief periods of recovery or abstinence - I began attending recovery meetings after the dissolution of my family. It was harder to believe things were well in an empty house. As I've gotten older, the physical declination has become more apparent. I saw a doctor the other day, and she said, ""You're not that bad... yet.""

I believe a lot of these issues stem from childhood circumstances. I'd prefer to believe that their cause doesn't make them inevitable - I've seen many people get better. But it's become frustrating to watch between bottles as my friends keep getting sober. I know they're frustrated to see people keep dying.

I'm trying to be completely honest. I don't think I'm right about everything but alcohol has been my best friend because it lies. It lets me believe anything I want until I'm too sick and have to cool off for a few days.

This is all probably relatable to a lot of people here. What I'm doing now is trying to stay as as connected and surrounded by like-minded people as possible. I'm also trying to listen to people which is difficult for me. (I'm a ""yeah I know but"" guy :)) Tonight I have a meeting, I ordered a buttload of fried food and my house is halfway clean.

This would be my third attempt quitting, if I were to quit. The first time I made it about a year and a half. The second time I made it about 6 months. I'm able to basically moderate and only have a few per day at this point.

It's unhealthy for my mind. It's unhealthy for my body. I'm keeping weight that I definitely don't want, but without it I'm extremely sad. I have no friends, the people at my work and in my neighborhood hate me. My dad is super hard on me and thinks of me as a failure of a person.

There is no positivity for me in my life and I see no future with a partner or with any friends. I simply do not get along with people. I'm turning into a depressed sociopath basically.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm not sure if quitting drinking is really the answer. It provides me with relief but it makes me feel really dumb and bogged down all the time. It's like I can't think to do anything else. Home is too stressful. Work is stressful.

Just recently found this thread and think it would do me some good talking about it and maybe just maybe make me accept I have a problem. For the last 10 years I‚Äôve pretty much had at least a six pack to myself a night. Over the past year and half that‚Äôs escalated into 8 to 12 beers a night. Being forced to work from home, become a teacher to my kids while they learn remote and dealing with an epileptic covid puppy we adopted at the start of covid (didn‚Äôt know she was epileptic) it‚Äôs just become part of the routine. This combined with the financial struggle of just trying to afford to live in San Diego has left me exhausted and only looking forward to sitting down at the end of the day playing some video games and getting wasted. I don‚Äôt drink during the day which is how I‚Äôve justified this behavior to myself for so long. I am almost 40 and feel like I‚Äôve got nothing to show for it; still rent, can‚Äôt afford a down payment on a ridiculously overpriced San Diego home, no savings, really in debt. I only have stuff to lose; my family and my decent job. 

With the recent rent hike of 260 a month I started to really go through my finances to see exactly where my money is going. I put each purchase into a category; essential and waste. It was really eye opening to see I give my local liquor store almost 700 bucks a month! (No wonder they really like me). It also made realize I buy dumb sh*t all the time and it‚Äôs mostly when I‚Äôve been drinking at night. 

With this realization I‚Äôve tried to stop drinking cold turkey 4 times in July. My longest stint was a single day. I tried again this month, but got really down on myself and ended up drinking more. 

So here I am today. On the verge of being able to call myself an alcoholic recognizing my behavior is ridiculous! I haven‚Äôt spoken to my significant other (or anyone) about it because I am ashamed. I hide it by taking out the trash when I go to bed and just say oh I only had a few when she does ask. I am sure everyone knows I like beer but have no idea how bad it really is. I wonder where we would be if I didn‚Äôt have those 10+ years of bad financial decisions because I was hungover or drunk. How different my relationship would be with my kids and wife?

I apologize about my ramblings but I feel better already, why not share your most guarded secret with the internet! While I don‚Äôt think I have hit the standard rock bottom, I feel emotionally and financially I‚Äôve hit rock bottom. I have no joy in anything besides tasting the new hippie beers in excess. 

So the day 0.5 you ask? Since I can‚Äôt just quit, I‚Äôve decided to cut it by half and hopefully progress to quitting for good. Last night I had 4 12oz beers instead of the normal 8 to 10 (I count pints as 1 beer, kinda shows you where I  am at). 

So if you have made it this far into my post, I thank you. I am not sure why I decided to come clean to the internet but I am hoping it can be a start of something good: accountability and finding others for support.

Start drinking Friday night after work, drink and play video games for the evening since I couldn't go out, then take anti-hangover supplements and drink Gatorades and water before bed. Wake up the next morning, not really too hungover, depending on how bad I was the night before, and have a coffee, something greasy for lunch, maybe start drinking late afternoon, then rinse and repeat the rest of the weekend. I'd rarely get restful sleep on weekends due to the drinking. 

Then, I'd usually be ""good"" for the most part the rest of the week. Have a beer or two one night watching the game, have a beer another night playing some games, and so on. A lot of weekdays I just wouldn't drink at all. But I noticed I'd always wake up tired. Even though I'd get a consistent 7-8 hours of sleep every night, it never truly felt restful.

My other problem came with sports. I've always been an athlete and love being active, but I got a little lazy at the start of the pandemic. Less exercise, more drinking. Finally after vaccinations and the world opening back up, I was able to get back to playing on my various sports teams. The downside is that even before the pandemic, I'd drink before the games to take the edge off because it would help me play better. Water during the games, and I'd get home and have another beer or two to help me go to sleep after being pumped up from all the exercise.

I'm not looking for a pat on the back or using this next information in any way to justify anything or claim how ""good"" I may or may not be. I NEVER drove drunk. I could never live with myself if I killed or injured someone else due to my own recklessness and stupidity. I'd never drink on the job or during the workday. I only ever had a drink in the morning to ""get over a hangover"" a handful of times. So maybe I'm not as far gone as I could be.

I got bloodwork done earlier this year. It was early in the week and I had come off a Thursday-Sunday of drinking. All of my numbers were in a healthy range except my ALT and AST. Those were slightly elevated, but I had never heard back from my doctor about it, so I assume they think it was fine. My blood pressure and everything else my doc observed at my physical the week or so before bloodwork were great. I'm at a healthy weight even though I should definitely exercise more and eat better.

So, why am I writing all of this? After scaring myself to death with Google results whenever I had any small ache or pain, and after reading people's stories here, I finally decided I want to get back in control before I go down a path I might never come back from. I want to be healthy. I REALLY love and value a good night's sleep, and I want to have that again. I want to look better again. Putting it into an actual statement in a great and supportive community makes me hope that I can hold myself accountable.

I had my last drink on Monday night as a ""bedtime beer"" and haven't had anything since. I've been really gassy starting Tuesday. I've been burping a lot and feel really bloated, especially in my lower abdomen. That hasn't gone down yet, and I'm still feeling that bloat pressure and am burping often as I type this. Wednesday was a bad day. Didn't eat right at all, threw up in the evening, and couldn't keep anything down after that. Went to bed early without really drinking any water and slept for maybe 3 hours out of the 11 that I was in bed for. Spent Thursday getting eventual real food and more water back into my system. My anxiety was through the roof, especially due to worrying about my GI stuff still going on and Googling myself to death.

And now it's finally Friday. I'm tired as of the early afternoon after getting up at 7am. Again, slept better, but still woke up sweating in the middle of the night and struggled to get back to sleep. Lots of weird dreams within dreams and sleep paralysis-type stuff went on as well. I'm still bloated and burping constantly, and I'd really like that to go away soon. Any idea how long the bloat and stuff might last? I'm clueless. I've skipped coffee since Monday too to ease my stomach even further. 

So, I'm finally going to to get my body back to ""normal."" I want to be able to sleep right again. I want to have more energy. I want to be in better shape. I want to give my liver time to heal so it can properly do its job. I have a short-term goal of keeping this going onto the next day. I have a longer-term goal of keeping this going for a month. My main goal is that I keep this going until I feel totally better again. After that? I'm not sure. I still like the taste of craft beers, so maybe I can get myself to a point of enjoying those socially in moderation. I won't know until I get to that point. All I know for sure right now is that I need to significantly cut back before I do damages I can't fix and ruin my life.

Thank you so much to anyone that reads this and thank you to everyone involved in this community. Whether you're here looking for support or being supportive, you are appreciated and valued. Your life is important. I hope my story can help someone else just as much as I hope finally sharing it can help me. IWNDWYT.",19,3

It helped me forget my Covid-19 anxiety while I was forced to stay home. It had just sort of became a thing I did to wind down: a single glass of wine, a beer, or a cider. Then virtual happy hour every Friday turned 1 drink to 2 or 3. Of course there was also Saturday so I could have another 2 or 3. I didn't really think anything of it but the 1 a night turned into 2, and my Fridays and Saturdays turned into 4 or 5. With restrictions lifted, my friend group started going on bar crawl outings,  and every time I ended up way too drunk and my partner would have to babysit me and take care of me. It hasn't progressed too far, I haven't done anything embarrassing or dangerous, but the last 2 weekends I blacked out and it scared the crap out of me. 

I have justified it, saying I'm not an alcoholic. I've never had half a bottle by myself, I haven't been too hungover to work, I haven't shirked any responsibilities. So I decided to take a week off of drinking, just to see. I've found myself wanting that wind-down drink for no reason. I've been thinking about why I've been thinking about drinking. I don't ever want it to go any further. I may not be a hardened alcoholic,  but I am an alcoholic.

He felt so ashamed about it that HE was sobbing on my floor. If we had been drunk, I know it would have been so much worse, but it was still probably one of the lowest moments of my life, and I have had some extremely low times. If we had been drunk, I probably would have yelled, said something I regretted, gotten in a fight, acted childish. Instead I sat on the floor with him and rocked him in my arms and brought him tissues, water, rubbed his back. It felt so unfair in that moment, because HE is the one that did this to himself and to me, and I wanted to be comforted myself. This morning I even thought of suicide and self harm like cutting my wrists, which is something I haven't done in probably 6 years. If I had not been sober this past month, I probably would have done it. Him and I were supposed to move to a new state at the end of this month, and now it's not happening (as long as I can retain any part of my self respect and leave him). I can't afford the place we were going to live alone, so now I'm left with less than a month to find a home in a state I don't even live in, which is incredibly difficult because I don't have a job there and no family that would cosign for me. I don't even know anyone there. I had job interviews this weekend but I got incredibly sick and was stuck in bed all week, couldn't even leave my apartment, so I had to cancel the trip and missed the interviews. I'm going crazy, as I typically like to be outside most of my free time. I couldn't work and am already so broke, so that stress has been creeping on me all week, not helping with anything.

Leading up to last night, this month sober I have realized a lot. I drink to numb myself, so not drinking has allowed me to begin to process my life, and it has been really difficult. I have realized I have not a single ""true"" friend. I have drinking buddies. I have realized the business I started after graduating college in spring is not even what I want to do. I am not happy at all. I am not even making enough to support myself anyway, I feel like a failure. I have realized my business administration degree is worthless, and have hella student loans to show for it. I am 26 years old and just now graduating. I went to college at the time that everyone else my age was already graduating. When I moved to the city I went to college in, I got a job with an abusive employer, and kept telling myself I would find a new job, and then covid hit. Bc I transferred from community college in another town, I only got to go to in person ""regular"" classes for one semester and one month of the second semester before covid hit and everything went online. I only ever met people here from my work. Besides the abusive job environment and covid, I left an abusive relationship of six years here. I loved him so much, and it was the hardest decision I ever made, but he had anger issues that he would take out on me. Maybe ironically, he was an alcoholic too, and almost every, if not every instance where he physically or mentally abused me, he had been drinking. You would think that after that I would have stopped drinking myself. Then I had the two people I thought were my closest friends here- a guy I was talking to (not dating but romantic & sleeping together, not dating bc I was fresh out of other relationship) for a couple months and someone who called herself my best friend, sleep together behind my back and never tell me, I found out from someone else. Now, after what happened last night with my boyfriend, I'm so ready to move out of this town, and this state. I feel like I have wasted my life. Once I make it to my new home, I know it will be worth it. But right now, it is terrifying.

So here I am, at rock bottom. I have no friends, no family, a failing business, no job in my new city, no home by the end of the month, no money, a worthless degree with student loans to pay back, BUT, I have not drank in one month today. And I will not today, either. You all have helped me so much. I have read this sub everyday. I'm sure no one is even still reading at this point after my essay of a sob story, but even just through writing this post I felt ""better"" enough to get up and get a glass of water and take my prescriptions. Next, I will try to eat something. Thank you all, for everything. I will not drink with you today.  If anyone read through this, I apologize for it being so long, and not even all alcohol related.",34,3

I have caved multiple times. I stopped for a day, then continued for weeks without even giving a second thought.
I used to sneak in the alcohol In the evening, start drinking till atleast 4-5am, then wake up, puke, hungover, then make myself another drink, then I'd be in heaven(atleast I thought so). I started to believe that it was the only life possible for me, I can't get by without alcohol. I used to day drink and drink during work (because wfh), didn't participate in any way. Kept distant from my family. I'd finish 1.5 litres easily in the 24 hour period. I couldn't eat without drinking atleast 2 50ml shots right before the meal.

And then, I don't know if it happened suddenly or over time. I started getting sick, didn't tell it to anyone, kept it to myself. I had a meal, and then ten minutes later.. bam.. everything out. I couldn't eat.. like anything.. even with water, I drank water and right out it came. I could just drink water when it was with vodka.
I got my calories from just the liquor. 
I had no energy, couldn't even get out of bed to go to the fridge. Even if I walked just 10 metres, my heart started racing, palpitations, running out of breath. 

It was the worst period of my life. I couldn't hide it anymore, not that I didn't try to, I tried my best to keep on going hard on the liquor (and in turn ruin everything). But, my family finally caught on, as I was in a horrendous condition. I was taken to the ER and was admitted, had to take everything from IV as I couldn't ingest anything. My bilirubin levels were off the charts. I was in the hospital for a week or so. Had withdrawals there, which were extremely bad (withdrawals are almost gone now, but the hand tremors are still there- very low as compared to when the started but still). 

I feel I was almost at the stage of DT, because I had a lot of hallucinations, especially auditory, and my heartbeat was erratic, and 130+ all the time. BP was out of control. 
I had developed acute alcoholic hepatitis and inturn causing jaundice. It was horrible, I suffered and now I realise I deserved it. 

But going to the hospital was the best thing that has happened to me, since then I am sober. I am doing extremely well. 

I had a cravings last week and last to last week as well. 
I searched how to stop them, I found support groups. I researched what if I just had one drink after all this. I found out about cirrhosis and I got shit scared. The doctor said that I was lucky enough, as I am young (early 20s) my liver survived through all this shit without scarring, didn't turn into something chronic and most of all no cirrhosis. Even one drink is poison for me now.

Whenever I get an urge or craving now, I just come to this subreddit. I read about people's success stories, their struggles, their experiences. I just feel refreshed and inspired to not give in to this poison. I spend hours on this page when I feel I need a drink or two, and by the time I'm done, so is the craving. The success stories motivate me and the struggles make me appreciate that I have been given another chance and I have to make the most of it.

It's hard to go through this phase all by yourself.
I had the support of my family, like full fledged support in anything I needed during these dark times. They went out of their way for me and that is something I can never forget or repay. Without someone by my side I wouldn't have been able to get on the brighter side.

Now I feel refreshed everyday, full of energy, brimming and smiling, I look forward to the day. I have started to put my energy into work again, which feels productive. I started reading and cut down on mindless TV show binging, which feels great. I even started doing some things which I loved as a child, like playing card games with my grandma, practicing magic (hope that doesn't come across as childish). I'm following the Olympics religiously. It's just great now, life is worth living, and I just want to be sober. I WANT TO BE SOBER.",21,0

Before it was officially announced that covid was in my state it had just started hitting Europe pretty hard. I started drinking way more then normal. A beer after work now and again is fine. Finishing a large bottle of hard alcohol in a week is not normal for me.

I knew once things started to shut down in my state and the down town area got empty it was going to get stressful real quick. I decided to stop drinking because if I was drinking a bottle of hard alcohol a week before it was here, I would be drinking more when its around me.


My boss and my coworkers look at me weird when I tell them Im not drinking right now because I know Ill over do it due to stress. Meanwhile all of them are saying they are giving into stress drinking and making weekly trips to the liquor store and say I should consider it which is a bit annoying considering last year I had more then just covid making the year stressful. My ex left me, partially due to covid, partially because shes controlling and I wouldn't go along with what she wanted. I also had a friend go to jail awaiting trial for ""allegedly"" killing someone. He was my friday night DM for D&D and D&D helped reduce stress during covid. In two and a half weeks it will be 1 year since his victim lost her life. A month after that, it will be 1 year since he was arrested.

I posted a while ago after a big screw up.  I appreciated the advice, but the cutback in drinking didn‚Äôt last long. Though, thankfully, I have managed to avoid any major fuck ups in the meantime. 

So, my story in a nutshell: I‚Äôve been drinking myself through a mostly sexless marriage and now the pandemic.  But it is clear to me that I‚Äôm harming myself.  There is a big history of alcoholism in my fam. Saw my mom die of cirrhosis at age 53, and not keen on following in her footsteps (now I‚Äôm early 40s) 

I‚Äôve started to notice a faint tingling in my feet. Last health check, the blood sugar was fine and I‚Äôll get it check again soon.  But even without going to the doctor, I can easily suspect that too much drinking is a possible cause. They could do a lot of test to rule out other causes, but in any case,  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll tell me to stop drinking.  And of course, that‚Äôs right.  I should do it for many reasons, but I find the fact that any further drinking is potentially irreparably damaging my nervous system to be especially compelling. 

This week I didn‚Äôt drink half the days‚Ä¶..which is a big improvement. It is nice waking up not tired or hungover!

So I‚Äôm looking to build on that progress. 

Questions and concerns:

1) is there a group like AA online but without any religious stuff?
2) gonna have to break it to my friends why I‚Äôm not drinking. It‚Äôll be fine if they are true friends‚Ä¶.just stressful

My husband and I will be married 5 years in September and we're considering not being together anymore. We were so attached at the hip for a long time, we shared all our interests and did everything together. Now we've grown and changed, I wouldn't even say we've grown apart but we just don't see what our future together looks like anymore. It used to be so clear.

The last time was had a crisis in our relationship was summer 2018 and he left to secure us an apartment in our new city and I stayed behind to pack and move. I spent three weeks not eating, not sleeping, and drinking. Drinking to cope with feeling alone and abandoned, drinking to make the time away from him go faster, drinking to punish myself for not being good enough.

I quit 11 months ago, partly because of that extremely scary spiral I'd experienced in 2018. This week, I can't eat, I can't sleep. I've been taking xanax (prescribed and used as directed) and benadryl to try and get some rest. I've been making banana and peanut butter smoothies because I literally cannot choke down anything else. I've lost 6 lbs in a week.

We asked on Facebook market place for used wood to build the raised garden for a prevention of drug abuse place here in town and we got an old deck cut and brought back by another volunteer and after building the raised garden there They gave me the leftover wood from the deck and 2 more donations so I ended up building 2 1 1/2 feetx4feet raised beds without legs and a big one that is over 4x4 feet. After putting those together we cut the plastic barrels in 2 and put some legs on them and ended up with 11 raised beds...I told my Mom that I could see a greenhouse where the 1st wooden bed is now and the next morning...I woke up with a donation from another balcony reno and last night my brother called he found 2 more big raised bed for free, they were the crate for some machinery things, 11 raised beds are filled and 10 have something planted, we found old tubing from a maple sirup producer for free to build 2 layers hoops on some beds to extend the season, all this is feeling a bit magical, I am amazed at how cheap building a garden can be if you ask for help and trade a little, this keeps me very grounded and content, may you find content in something as well!

These are the reasons I love not drinking.,"This post is more for myself, but if it helps you then that‚Äôs a plus as well. These are the reasons I love not drinking, to remind myself why I stay sober. 
 
Energy - when I‚Äôm hungover I don‚Äôt want to be a real person and I try my hardest not to be. Life isn‚Äôt fun. I waste hours/days doing nothing or hating the fact that I have to be an adult. I get things done when I‚Äôm sober, simple things. Errands. Shit I wouldn‚Äôt ever do or have been putting off for weeks/months because I‚Äôm too hungover to function. I have a clear head, strong motivation, and the consistent energy to be better every day. 

Sleep - this ties into energy. When I‚Äôm sober I sleep so well. I‚Äôm able to get up early and fall asleep at a normal time. Being well rested feels incredible. 

Anxiety - when I drink too much I wake up in the middle of the night with the worst anxiety. The combination of feeling like shit and also judging myself makes it almost impossible to go back to sleep. I‚Äôm done with the night terrors. I am also way less anxious during the day.

Integrity - when I‚Äôm drunk I lie. Not all the time, but it happens. I lie about dumb shit. Shit that doesn‚Äôt need to be lied about. I‚Äôll make up shit for no reason to any random person I meet, fake stories about a life I‚Äôve never lived or something similar. It‚Äôs stupid and it‚Äôs not who I am. 

Mood - when I‚Äôm sober my mood is stable. I‚Äôm calm, clear headed, focused, and mostly happy. I don‚Äôt have major mood swings. When I‚Äôm hungover I am anxious, tired, upset with myself, and unmotivated.

Relationships - trouble always seems to find me when I‚Äôm drinking. Whether I‚Äôm the problem because I‚Äôm being stubborn and obnoxious or someone around me is causing a problem; it‚Äôs always when alcohol is involved. I‚Äôm tired of relationships being strained, tested, or ruined because of alcohol. It‚Äôs just not worth it. I want to be in the moment with people, especially those I love, and I want the moment and the feelings to be real.

Memory - this kind of ties into relationships. I want to be able to remember my experiences and feel them for what they are. I‚Äôm tired of my SO asking me something and me not remembering because I was drunk. I‚Äôm tired of feeling like vacations are an excuse to get ripped when they should be about remembering the experiences. 

Diet/Exercise - this is night and day. If I‚Äôm drinking, I‚Äôm not working out for at least 2 days, usually longer. I barely eat and when I do I eat like shit. I have so many goals that I want to accomplish for myself and I am 100% consistent when I‚Äôm sober. When I‚Äôm hungover I default on my promises to myself and I take more steps backwards than forwards. 

Self Care - when I‚Äôm sober I treat myself and my body like I actually care about it. Aside from eating right and exercising I do simple shit like shower regularly, brush my teeth twice a day, floss, take care of my skin. When I‚Äôm hungover it‚Äôs like pulling teeth just getting myself to shower. My hygiene suffers tremendously and that‚Äôs unacceptable. 

Long sorry short, I‚Äôm a better person when I‚Äôm sober. I‚Äôm better to myself and to those around me. I‚Äôm more active, more energetic, more present, and more alive. There is nothing that I get from alcohol that is worth sacrificing all of this for. Period.",6,0

We make a point of getting together at least once a week to hang out which basically meant we'd get wasted. Every. Single. Time.   


Last night I hesitantly agreed to go meet up, knowing it would be a real test. When I arrived they were already a bit buzzed, we hung out, they kept drinking and I kept sober. We often play cards and the loser of whatever game we're playing has to do a forfeit, which is always a shot. I ate whole chilis when I lost (ouch) and they did whole shots. I even resisted smoking cigarettes, despite being extremely tempted throughout the night.   


By the end of the night one mate could barely stand and the other could barely walk, they both seemed completely battered. It was strange to be sober and see that, knowing full well that has been me every single time I've touched a drink for as long as I can remember.  


I helped one friend home then walked back myself, with my shoulders back and my head held high. I was and still am, extremely proud of last night, even if it isn't that big of a deal to many people. This morning I woke up early, lifted weights, did 30 minutes of yoga, made breakfast and started working, all the while feeling fresh, motivated and happy.

I used your advices. I put my best efforts to change the shitty miserable that I am. I couldn't afford therapy and my family don't let me to go to AA meetings, despite how much they hate muy drunk self. So I started meditating, mindfullness, sleeping and eating well...I become a little better than I used to be. 

Until Monday..the bottle caught me again..I have been drinking for four days straight. I have been used by whatever woman that found me cute and decided to make out with me despite I was barely standinf up by my own (I don't care to be honest. It is not abuse because I just really don't care what happens with my life, I am giving up). I have an awful pain on my stomach and hips, my hangover is top 3 of the worst ones from the last 12 years. I can't focus on my real life job and activities, I just feel like my efforts to change are just a way to spend my time between hangovers. The more I try to run away from my past self, the more I try to become someome better, I find ton of shit under my soul. It is a fight that I can't win. 

I know that AA is the answer, but my parents would stop caring about me if I admit that I am an alcoholic. Please, could someone help me to find other resources? Please, I don't want to be Who I am. I want to stop being useless and stupid.",30,0

I‚Äôm also 19.,"I developed a really bad relationship with alcohol in high school. I think it‚Äôs largely to do with being surrounded by alcoholics growing up. 


6 months ago I had a fight with my mum and decided to go to a house party with my cousin and get blind. I ended up full sending it and drank a whole bottle of vodka plus tequila shots (this was verified by my cousin and Aunty). I don‚Äôt remember anything except for somehow ending up on a couch struggling to breathe. I tried to get someone to call an ambulance but I was too drunk to call out to anyone. Not to mention everyone was leaving and I was left by myself in my cousins shed. I was on the couch for roughly 20 minutes gasping for air, if felt like my lungs were paralysed. I remember eventually not being able to breathe and I passed out thinking I was dying. Somehow I didn‚Äôt. The next morning I woke up, absolutely no hangover or Ill effects from the night before. Not even a fucking headache or stomach ache.

I‚Äôm not religious, but if there is a god he saved my life that night. There‚Äôs no fucking way any human could‚Äôve survived drinking that much alcohol without receiving medical attention. I stopped breathing on that couch and should‚Äôve died. I think whatever is out there in the spiritual world, wether it‚Äôs god or a guardian angel was sending me a message to get my shit together and gave me a chance. 

I hate the way alcohol made me (and other people) look while intoxicated. Alcohol makes people look fucking pathetic. Look at you, pissing yourself and hardly able to string a sentence together. I personally think being intoxicated is one of the most degrading things you can do to yourself. There‚Äôs no love lost going sober. I‚Äôm grateful I‚Äôve been able to make this decision at such a young age, even if I‚Äôve already lost so many friends because of it.

Don‚Äôt mean to be all spiritual, love yourself and love those who hold you dearly.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Weekends are rough for many of us. It took quite some time before I began to see all the opportunities that lay in a couple of days off - and that alone is incredible! Two precious days off, and they¬¥re laid to waste.

Now I cherish every morning I get to make a cup of coffee and slowly breathe in and out in a few minutes of silence. Life has its ups and downs, but it¬¥s mine, it isn¬¥t held hostage by expensive, destructive distraction, postponing every plan and dream.

I quickly learned that I needed to make a plan, though. What to do when cravings hit, when it¬¥s that time of day, when the bbq gets hot, when things go wrong, when emotions start rolling... I found tremendous help in HALT; whenever I wanted a drink, I would stop and check if maybe I was really Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired (some add Stressed to the list). I usually was. The best solution for me was to stay one step ahead, by always being hydrated and keeping a piece of fruit or a light snack handy. Whenever I would foresee or feel a craving coming, I would drink water or juice or eat something and that would take the edge off the craving. Likewise I made plans to stay occupied, to bring NA drinks for myself, to have an exit strategy, lots of little helpers to make sure I could tick one more day.

I am 30 year old (Male) and I have been clean of alcohol and drugs since October 22th 2019 (654 days).   
I had outpatient therapy for over a year at a addiction instance and have joined NA since January 2020.  
Before that, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, this had to do with all our arguments, but also because of my use of cocaine (and other drugs) and alcohol. Before this relationship of 4.5 years, I have had troubles with drugs (and alcohol) as well as problems with pornography and visiting prostitutes.  


It has been a hell of a ride, with all ups and downs. But in the end I am very clean to be sober. My life is not a mess anymore, I am more healthy (both physically as mentally), my relationships with my friends and family is improved, financially I am in a way better position than I used to be..in the end live is way better sober.  


But not everything is perfect, that's why I am writing this post. I have some problems enjoying my current life. Sometimes it feels so boring nowadays and repetitive, with no real things to look out to.  
I dated several girls, but with no real succes.  
I feel I need a new job (this job feels less and less interesting, partly because I work at home since March 2020, I can now go to the office 2 days a week, but you sit there all by yourself, so that's not a major improvement).  
Luckily, I have this vacation planned over a month (hopefully this will break some of the routine).  


I already go to the gym several times a week, visit friends and family, but I feel I'm kinda stuck in a boring routine which delivers good results in terms of job, finance and prevention of problems, but also feels kind of boring.   


Does anyone here have tips?

  
Thanks very much.

Figured I'd post some thoughts as day 5 starts technically. Why not?,"I don't know if anyone has been where I've been, but I figure in this moment of clarity/peace, I should add my grain of sand into the mix. 

Literally a week or so ago, I posted on here about how much I hated my life. How much I hated everything. How lost I felt, and those were true honest feeling. 

This was and has been the product of a few years of daily drinking. Started fun, became misery, and I drowned in it. Lost a job, some friends, some dignity, a little bit of everything really. And honestly I can't say at the moment im done losing things. That though I don't really care about anymore. It's all about kicking alcohol out of my life. 

I feel like I'm leaving a girlfriend. I'm a sensitive guy, and I never really did great with breakups personally. But with people, you can't just go buy more at the store to get ""one more time"" out of it. Once it's gone it's gone. Text em all you want, call all you want, doesn't matter when someone is done with you, they're done. 

That's how I've decided to treat alcohol. It calls ALL THE TIME and won't stop. It doesn't seem to get the hint. I'm done with it. It'll be different this time? Suuuuuure. Well do what I want sometimes this time? Riiiiiiiight. I don't want the abuse anymore, and I'm not taking the bait. 

Wanna guilt shame me back into it? Worked last time, not this time. Wanna talk about the good times? I've already acknowledged them, and it was fun at first. Never will be again, and it's not even fun I want to have. No one else will ever love me? First off, rude. Secondly, I doubt that, but at this point I'm more worried about loving myself before we even talk about that. 

Everything this addiction tells you is so similar to an ex who desperately wants you back. Alcohol wants You back, not the other way around. Alcohol is the one begging. Crawling back with offers, insults, and reaching for any possibility that you might stoop down and give it another chance. The 100th chance was enough. I get it. It won't be different this time. We have to go our separate paths. There's a better life for me. I deserve that life.",37,0

This isn't the fear of missing out on fun, but more personally impacting on your longer term growth goals.

For a long time I'd stay in a relationship or friendship too long because of a pretty significant fear that not having a particular person in my life would have me miss out on a few things in my longer term planning horizon. Career goals, marriage, ect.

I limited myself on that without these people around I'd miss out on major positive life events that are ""right around the corner"". They're not bad people, they're just not on the same page as me on a couple different levels that are important to me.

That's okay.

Drinking made me stick around situations too long. It also made me a terrible communicator with people closest to me. Ironically I'd bottle up resentment and well, turn to the bottle as reason number #3789 to drink. It wasn't even a direct and conscious decision when I think about it, but at nearly two months in it was revealed to me.

Today, wasn't a great day. I won't get into it, this isn't the post for that.

But my point is this, even a rough day is still significantly better not drinking and it's easier to sail and pilot the ship not buzzed or half drunk. Well, let's be honest, fully drunk.

This is where I found my first tribe of literally hundreds of thousands of other people all trying to do the same thing. From the bottom of my heart, you guys are the freakin best.

About 6 years ago I found out I was pregnant with my son. He was a surprise, and I struggled my entire pregnancy with trying to stay away from alcohol. It was a hard time after he was born. I would resent my poor baby for getting in the way of me getting my next drink. I kept boxes of wine in the fridge next to bottles. My baby was healthy and cared for, but I struggled to be present and not in constant pain, waiting for the next moment I could slip off and sneak some wine straight out of the bag. 

I just found out I'm pregnant again. There is so much peace, and just... pure joy. I don't think I was capable of feeling those raw emotions when I was drinking.

I hit her and then went all the way around her, fully intended to drive off NGL, but convenient cop in the fucking rearview...I pull over he doesn't even take my license.

I honestly didn't enjoy those 2 1/2 months. Instead of trying to enjoy my life without alcohol, I was avoiding my life to not put myself in a position to drink. I didn't trust myself nor did I think my friends would support me because they all drink pretty heavily and I worried if our friendships were based around it. The multi-tier anxiety made it really easy to fall back into things.

After 2 months straight of basically bender weekends, I called it quits again on July 5th. However, this time I did NOT avoid life. Instead, I engaged it directly, reminding myself that I wanted to cut alcohol out of my life, not cut my life up to avoid alcohol. So throughout the month, I tried to keep my weekend activities as normal as possible. I went to a baseball game. I went to a party. I went to the beach. Not once, was I remotely tempted to accept a drink, and thankfully the friends I was with were all supportive of my choice.

I have admittedly been eating more on the weekends. Thankfully I go to the gym, so I didn't experience any weight gain. It's part of the process as I keep trying to sort my mind out and move forward towards a better future.

One month down, planning on many, many, many more to go!

I can hardly believe it!,"It‚Äôs been two years since alcohol passed through my lips. Not quite two since it was in my body because that last hangover lasted for days.  I actually hadn‚Äôt known how long my hangovers lasted before because it takes on average ten days for alcohol to leave the human body and I rarely went ten days without consuming alcohol most of my adult life.

Of course, there were times when I stopped, to ‚Äòprove‚Äô to myself and to others that I could stop if I wanted.  Those times were hard because I kept thinking about alcohol.  I let it consume my brain power, when I was drinking it and when I wasn‚Äôt.  That‚Äôs why I was so scared when I stopped because I knew I needed to stop for good - or at least for a good while.  Not a week like the last time, or 40 days or a month, much, much longer.  And because before I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it, whether I was consuming it or not, or how much I would let myself consume or when I would next let myself consume, I feared not consuming it, in case that consumed me.

What I have discovered is that the more time I put between my now-self and my quitting date, the less time I have spent thinking about alcohol.  I could never have believed I would have changed my mind so completely about what alcohol gave to me.  Not consuming alcohol has given me more time, more money, better health and better relationships.  Not consuming alcohol has helped me find other things.  Not consuming alcohol has made me more relaxed.  

Of course, it‚Äôs hard.  There‚Äôs only so much yoga or exercise or re-watching of TV shows or baths or even chocolate that I can take.  There is no replacement for the numbness that alcohol gives you.  You have to sit through discomfort and that is no fun at all but it does get easier and I know myself better now.

Not drinking has its perks too.  I no longer have to constantly think about where the next glass of wine is or how long it‚Äôs taking to get here.  I no longer have to get an alcoholic drink to relax or celebrate or unwind and I am no longer automatically just waiting for the end of a stressful day so I can pop that cork.  I enjoy preparing other drinks for myself and find solace in that ritual and reward in allowing myself that.  As an added bonus, I wake up feeling clear-headed, fresh and unremorseful in the morning.  I much more present in the things I experience.

I have lived through birthdays (unimaginable), airports (unimaginable), Christmases (unimaginable), nice dinners (unimaginable), parties (unimaginable), barbecues (unimaginable), some of the hardest days (unimaginable), summer (unimaginable), winter (unimaginable), a wedding (unimaginable), reunions with old friends (unimaginable), meet ups with new acquaintances (unimaginable), cheese boards (unimaginable) and much, much more I probably don‚Äôt even remember - without alcohol.  Except I do remember them now! (Just not right now.)

I have even happily refused a drink.  I never thought this would be possible.  I thought I would always begrudge saying no, just a little bit.  But I have said ‚Äòno‚Äô with a smile on my face - a real one, not a grin and bear it one.  I have declared ‚Äòoh no, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol‚Äô and ‚Äòit‚Äôs a non-alcoholic beer‚Äô for me.  Some people I know now didn‚Äôt even know drunk me (unimaginable).

Our lives are bound by what we can imagine.  I only imagined I could escape the cycle of getting drunk, 'calming' the nerves, increasing the nerves and getting drunk again.  I only imagined that I could get through one dinner or one board games afternoon or one quiet evening alone, on my own with no one around to hold me accountable.  And so I did it, one ‚Äòone‚Äô at a time.  Unremorseful beats numbness hands down.

For the past several years, I used alcohol to mask all of my emotions. Now, without it, I feel EVERYTHING.

I have been doing everything to keep calm and collected. It has just been building. Today at work I messed something up. While my boss was speaking to me, something snapped.

I just broke down crying. I couldn't stop. He dismissed me and I left for an early lunch because I could not hold it together. It was awful. I am still trying my best to keep it together.

Now, I just want to drink. I just want to take away the embarrassment. I want to not feel. I want to be in alcohols warm embrace.

Yet, I know that is a devious illusion.

Does anyone have any advice on handling emotions when in early recovery?",16,1

3746,2021-08-05 15:43:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/oyq4ku/reflections_on_82_days/,Reflections on 82 days,"I meant to post at 60 days but, as it turns out, you can get yourself pretty busy when you aren't drunk on the couch all day, everyday. 82 is somewhat random, but I can't believe I'm already here. 

It's been both easy and hard, sometimes confusingly at the same time. I've definitely identified triggers that make me want to drink, but in reality, I want to drink all the time. There's still a voice in my head that pops up everytime I'm alone, telling me where the closest booze is. I made a trip to Lowe's today and my first thought after getting in the car was that no one would know if I stopped for a large beer at Chili's (classy, right?). But I've turned down some serious temptations, including cooking with wine once (that was hard) and being alone in a friend's house with a fridge full of various booze. She didn't really know the full extent of my problem, so she wouldn't have batted an eye at a few being gone when she got home. But I didn't do it. And now it's been 82 days without a drop of alcohol. 

Here's a random collection of thoughts/things I've noticed  since finally quitting:

- I feel great. No more hangovers, significantly less anxiety, more energy. I lost about 10 lbs pretty quickly but have plateaued without adding in any real effort. 
- Oh my god. Chocolate and Cookies 'n Cream ice cream. Where have you been all my life?
- I'm angry that I can't drink. I'm trying so hard to change my perspective (alcohol = poison, not reward), but it's hard.
- I'm saving money.
- Best way (for me) to tell acquaintances that I don't drink anymore is to say, ""I quit drinking. It was becoming kind of a problem, so I just quit."" Not everyone needs to know how big of a problem it really was. 
- Most common reaction when I tell people is, ""Yeah, I've been drinking too much, I need to cut back."" No one has pried beyond clarifying if I've quit all together or just cut back. 
- Telling people close to me the real truth was a good move. They've all been super supportive (my mom just sent me Quit Like A Woman on audible, out of the blue) and are good for accountability.
- Having **something** to drink/hold/sip on while other people are drinking has been **hugely** helpful for me. I've even gone to a bar and was perfectly happy sitting with friends while drinking a mock tail. Plain water just doesn't do the same thing, it's got to be something slightly special. Even plain seltzer works for me.
- I'm afraid that I'll cheat and lie to my husband. I really want to cheat, just once, by enjoying a bottle of wine, alone, in front of the TV. I dream about this. My brain keeps telling me that once would be okay, but I read enough on here about how moderation is a tempting lie to know better. I don't think I can moderate.

I wanted to thank this community for its kindness, and for just being here when I'm having a hard minute and need to remind myself why having *just one* isn't a good idea. You guys are amazing and you can all do it, too.

It felt amazing to rid my body of the toxins and to start a new journey of sobriety. The reason I (M, 28) stopped was because of one really bad night out; I was throwing up all outside of the bar, threw up outside of my friend's house, and had the worst hangover of my life. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and just feeling ashamed of the person looking back at me. I told myself that I was better than that. Funny enough... I don't exactly have an alcoholic problem... I'd drink socially maybe one weekend each month; but in the past it was every single weekend. Anyways, fast forward to now, I've committed to this journey as I know it'll improve my life in every aspect. I went on vacation with some buddies two weeks ago and I broke the streak, literally right after the 60 day milestone. I broke it not necessarily out of peer pressure, but almost to run a test on myself. I wanted to see if it would spark the same liberating feeling that it once gave me...it didn't. In the past, I used alcohol as a crutch to feel more loose and outgoing in social settings, but I've changed a LOT in just a few years. Going out to bars/clubs just doesn't do it for me anymore, especially as I've realized I'm a lot more introverted than I thought. Honestly, it was good for me to break the streak b/c I didn't even enjoy the drink. As much as I don't want to be defined by the number of days I've quit alcohol, I do think this time is for good. I write this in hopes to inspire others on this journey, no matter how far along, as the key point is not to focus on the days, but to simply lead a better life W/O the poison!

I Don't want to drink...

And this Naked Mind approach is much more approachable to me...because AA...I am not going to criticize it at all...but it seemed like this super long process, i tried it.  I am not good at that.  I keep quitting, but i can get triggered and because of low impulse control...i just go try to put out whatever feeling triggers me with alcohol....and the cycle continues.  This naked mind approach has helped me put together pretty good stretches of AF days...but I am frustrated with myself. 

I do things that I logically know are ridiculous...I know I need to get something done...and I setup a task a reminder...and i just blow it off.   Even when I am not drinking, I do this Non-alcohol related. 

I even have reminders that are based on geolocation (nerd alert) when I get near any location i buy alcohol. including grocery stores...to not buy alcohol.  I know that is good for me‚Ä¶.that is why i took the time to setup reminders.  But i can just ignore it even if my phone is blowing up saying don‚Äôt buy alcohol.  I can quit all the time...it isn't a physical addiction.

WTF!!!  

Alcohol I believe only makes my ADHD WORSE!!   It is so frustrating.    

I was diagnosed with ADHD by a Dr. Hallowell facility...and he is kind of a guru with ADHD and trusted authority....so not self diagnosed. 

I really try not to beat myself up when I fail...but I can logically look at myself and say...why do you do this....i can not adult very well.   It's not just alcohol...it's other areas of my life buy alcohol just adds to the stack of crap I am dealing with.

I used to think for so many years that if you didn't cry or show emotions it made you tough...Now, through becoming more sober, I see how illogical that way of thinking is. When I was heavy into my drinking, I often found myself crying only when I was close to blacking out and never in front of anyone. I thought, ""This is how you deal with it. All these thoughts and emotions that you can't face head on. Drink them away."" A rough childhood will have you face certain situations and feelings you weren't meant to experience and made worse when you aren't explained how to cope with the feelings and experiences. 

I was told to go to my room whenever I was punished and was crying. There was no one there to tell me it was alright or that it would be okay. So, I would suck it up, feel like shit and proceed to school, maybe forget about home life for a bit, only to dread coming home, awaiting more possible punishment. Often, I was told I was a ""bad kid"" and I believed it. Anytime I hear that phrase now, I'm filled with rage. Therapy has helped open the door and offered a few angles as to why that is and for that I'm grateful. There's a baseline to work from but it is just that, it's work. Even in the smallest of moments like when my cat scratches my nice computer chair a million times.

The rewards for being sober and able to address issues that have been plaguing my life have been unparalleled to anything before. I'm able to feel, I'm able to laugh wholeheartedly, I can be confident in my decisions. And one thing I never considered was that I would tell myself that it's okay to cry. It's okay to shed a tear. Let them fall onto your shirt because the tears will dry. It's okay to feel sad. It's okay to feel angry. These moments will pass and though they may linger, we can always try to make an adjustment for the better.

I just wanted to remind you that as we face this awful Delta variant which is twice as contagious as the original Covid-19 virus, the body's immune system is harmed and weakened by alcohol, especially binge drinking. 

In order to protect our bodies from this awful, highly contagious virus, a good immune system is so important (in addition to indoor masking and vaccines). Binge drinking absolutely weakens the immune system.

Also, if you choose to get vaccinated but binge drink a couple days before or after the shot, your body likely won't create an ideal amount of antibodies, because all that alcohol weakened the immune response and the body is spending so many resources eliminating that toxic substance, alcohol. So if you do choose to get vaccinated like I did, it is strongly suggested to take a break from drinking for a couple weeks, because a drunk or hungover body is not going to get the full benefits it should get from the vaccine.",18,12

When I decided to stop drinking entirely, I was filled with anxiety, fear, and a sense of loss.

The decision to *never drink again* seemed foolishly extreme. The reality of dealing in absolutes (never?!) sent me into a mental tailspin. Was I really making the right choice? Wouldn't I regret this at some point down the road?

I feared the implications behind telling people I decided to stop drinking. I balked at labeling myself as an addict or an alcoholic. I had (have) a problem with alcohol, but I felt like a fraud going beyond that. I feared I would be unwelcome in sober spaces for not having a ""real"" problem.¬†

I mourned all the drinks I would never get to drink. It made me sad as I thought about them unopened, unpoured, unloved‚Ä¶ It was perhaps the grief I felt toward imagined alcohol that really cemented this as the right decision for me.

When I decided to stop drinking, I also pictured the milestones in front of me. I thought about how *cool* it would be to make it to triple-digits - to 100 days. It seemed like a laughably-lofty goal at the time; on day one, even 100 *hours* seemed unattainable.¬†

Then I thought about how cool it would be to make it beyond 100 days - to 101 days. At the time, I labeled it my ""Dalmatian Day"" because of *101 Dalmatians*. It became my overarching goal to make it to my Dalmatian Day.

And now here I am, waking up on day 101. I did it! There is a part of me that can't believe I've actually accomplished this; feels somewhat surreal.

While it has been my choice each day to not drink, I truly don't think I could have made it here without the love and support of this community. I have relied on it heavily, and you all have been a huge help in getting here.

It‚Äôs hard to believe that what started out as simply taking a month off of drinking in November 2018 has turned into 1000 days without a drink (or a cigarette for that matter), that I went from 20 beers a day to zero after waking up one day and deciding that being hungover sucks. 

As this day approached, I thought a lot about what I have gained and lost in sobriety. Things I have lost: a number of friends who turned out to only be drinking buddies, my relationship with my mom and sister, 30 pounds (losing isn‚Äôt always bad). Some things I have gained: multiple new hobbies, a promotion at work, a new perspective on the effects of alcohol, the ability to sleep through a night and get up early, the ability to handle stress without turning to alcohol, an appreciation of silence. 

The list of gains is longer. 

I think about drinking everyday. I miss it, I love it. It is my favorite thing and I think it will always be my favorite thing. But I am not drinking‚Äôs favorite thing. Drinking hates me, I am its enemy, drinking wants to kill me in the slowest and most painful way. Yet I still love it. It will always be an abusive relationship that I look back on with graduation goggles. 

My life wasn‚Äôt magically fixed by getting sober. Happiness isn‚Äôt a switch you can just flick on. I still have mood swings. I still don‚Äôt know how to have fun around other people without alcohol, but I‚Äôve learned to enjoy being by myself. I‚Äôve gained some semblance of control over my life, and things have slowed down. That‚Äôs been worth it. 

I don‚Äôt worry about relapsing anymore. Those days are behind me. The term new normal has been tossed around a lot lately but people don‚Äôt really know what it means. I will always miss drinking, but there is no going back. There can‚Äôt be. This is truly my new normal and even though it sucks a lot of the time this is how it will be, because alcohol doesn‚Äôt love me the way I love it.

Let's just say we had a ""discussion"" involving her and other teenagers and other parents last night. All is good.

Had I been drinking, not only would they have laughed me out of their driveway never to be invited back again, but my drunken anger would have escalated things beyond imagination.

Life is hard. There are plenty of challenges present, why in the world would I ever want to make things much much more difficult?

Not only that, I was the diffuser of the bunch. And after it was all over ... I didn't even think about wanting a drop.

I woke up this morning, immediately remembered last night, realized I am sober....and out of all the 30 days so far, THIS MORNING was easily the one that I am most grateful for being sober. I immediately muttered thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you.

Have a great Thursday everyone. If lazy ass me can win some battles with this then ***anyone*** can. Let's stick together and kick some ass.

Over university I discovered a real love for good beer though. I would travel all around the city I was living in then to find specific blends, flavors, limited editions, etc. It wasn't too bad at the time, I was drinking around 3 beers a day. Uuuntil Covid hit, I got around to getting craft beer subscriptions to my door, but since I was home all day, I would burn through my entire weekly box in two days out of boredom, so I started buying quantities of cheap lager to use as ""filler"" beers between my nicer crafts. Queue 1 year later, I was drinking roughly 8-12 beers a day, every day. My memory deteriorated immensely and I became wholeheartedly incapable of falling asleep without being hammered.

Yesterday was really tough and I was riding the waves of detox. That first night going into day 1, I didn't manage to get *any* sleep whatsoever. It seriously sucked in it's own right... But last night was something all together different. 

The general discomfort and anxiety were thankfully much less and relatively bearable. However, I experienced something I've never felt before and am very much looking forward to never having to go through again. 

(Warning: I've spared a lot of the detail, but please, if you're not in a stable headspace, it might be triggering.)

As I closed my eyes, my brain started conjuring a frantic, uncontrolable montage of grotesque and disturbing images. Distorted figures of people and just... stuff that looked like something out of Dali's worst nightmares, would collide and morph in excruciatingly vivid detail. It's so, SO, hard to describe but it was more than just the images themselves but the *feeling* that accompanied them that was the worst of all.

I felt like I was on some kind of bad trip. Like the images were trying to convey some kind of meaning and that they carried significant messages that I needed to hear. It felt like there was a spirit, something parasitic and decidedly evil that I was trying to purge and in doing so it was writing in it's death throws. It almost felt like I was able to hear an alien language that spoke in multiple dimensions, and I could somehow just faintly understand it.

I received a few... messages, during the experience. I've forgotten a lot of them now that I'm awake but the big one was oddly comforting. I lost my dad to alcoholism when I was 13. He was going through the exact same thing I'm now experiencing. But he didn't survive it. I felt a deep connection to him then. I understood his torment for the first time.

Luckily the episode only lasted half of the night and slowly subsided enough for me to get a few hours of sleep. I had been researching a *lot* about the physiological effects of detox and kindling. I know that my last binge has probably done some real damage to my brain which I'm hoping I can heal from. I know that last nights episode has a very real, medical explanation to it. But the experience was uncomfortably surreal.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I'd be interested to hear your stories or if any medical professional out there would be able to chime in.",11,0

Unfortunately it takes six weeks for it to work fully, and the voices got very bad yesterday. I rang the mental health centre. A nurse was supposed to call but she never did. I rang again and they said she'd call first thing today. I rang the after Hours GP and she prescribed 2mg of Ativan for last night which helped.

I want my psychiatrist to prescribe 2mg Ativan for a few weeks while we wait to see if the anti psychotic works. I wouldn't even need to take it every day because sometimes I can deal with the voices. But sometimes they get very bad. It's terrible having people in your head attacking you, using all your memories, all your flaws against you, threatening to harm your friends and family if you don't kill yourself. And the voices seem so real when they get bad. I start to think there's audio implants in my hears and a device in my vocal chords to read my thoughts.

Aside from 2mg ativan, alcohol helps. It really lessens the intensity of my psychotic episodes. I don't want to drink. I'm 127 days sober, the longest I've managed in a decade. But the voices get unbearable and I don't see myself staying sober if I don't get Ativan.",11,0

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

\- - - - -

Morning everyone! Hope you‚Äôre all doing well today.

I‚Äôve recently been reflecting on how grateful I am to feel more in tune with my body and how that has enabled me to make good decisions that support my physical health. Feeling physically bad was my baseline for years. Unless it was a medical emergency, it was hard to recognise emerging health issues because I was generally always suffering as a result of alcohol. I regularly failed to make any good choices when it came to my health, and for years I wasn‚Äôt at all an active stakeholder in my own physical wellbeing. 

I was daunted when I first quit drinking as it felt like there were so many things to navigate and new habits to learn. Sleeping properly, drinking more water, washing my face before bed ‚Äì they seemed like pretty big and effort-making things in the first months, but as time went on I found myself with a greater capacity to make better choices and maintain good habits. Drinking was the catalyst for all my poor decisions around my physical health, so it made sense that sobriety became the catalyst for making some pretty good ones. 

I‚Äôm grateful that in sobriety I‚Äôve been able to take care of myself better. I‚Äôm in a good spot with my health right now and I am really grateful. I dropped to a regular weight since getting sober. I also noticed that I suffered badly with severe PMS; I never noticed the specific patterns in the symptoms while I was drinking ‚Äì I had just put it down to depression or anxiety. Understanding the nuances has enabled me to access medication that‚Äôs now controlling those symptoms completely. Additionally, I recently quit my vaping habit. I‚Äôm a bit of a grouchy individual right now, but I‚Äôm resilient enough to handle this process and it feels so great to be able to make good choices about my health and to follow through on them. I never thought it would be me. 

Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share what you‚Äôre grateful for today - whether that‚Äôs your own reflections on any positive health choices you‚Äôve made during your journey, or whatever you‚Äôre appreciating right now ‚Äì the big or small things.

Take care!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

We¬¥re going through [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) this week, and I¬¥m simply delighted and relieved to see that they have a lot of support in the community. I haven¬¥t seen anyone argue that the rules are dumb! But please do if you think so, we¬¥re all for discussion here.

Today¬¥s hot topic: **Post only while sober**. Why is posting while drunk a huge no no? Isn¬¥t that what the sub is for? People with drinking issues?

Yes, but it can only be that if it¬¥s a safe space, and not a drunk tank. Have you ever tried to argue with a drunk person? It¬¥s not amusing. It never ends and it never goes anywhere. It¬¥s painful even to watch. For that same reason we do not discuss what qualifies as ""drunk"" or ""drinking""; it¬¥s just a waste of time and energy. We try to be gentle with honest errors, but repeated offenses and arguing will eventually lead to a ban. Trolls are banned without warning.

Removing posts is not fun, like, ever, and even less when someone is in a rough spot. Therefore it¬¥s endlessly important for me to stress: *We DO want you to come back and post when you¬¥re sober!* Seriously. We just want you to leave your guns at the door. That makes everyone more comfortable - and it allows you to do some actual work.

I will not drink with you today!

I was a chronic relapser so this feels great. For the people that are having trouble and relapsing I will share what works for me now and what didn't work and made me relapse.

What I've done differently is use emotion not reasoning.

Reasoning is too slow. In the wild if humans used reasoning instead of instant emotional responses they would probably be dead in days. A lion would have eaten us while we reasoned if we should run or not. Emotion almost always overrides reasoning. If that lion is coming at you, it is impossible to reason that moment, emotion is more powerful than reasoning.

Drugs don't use reasoning they uses emotion.

Before I would be like a dumb boxer standing toe to toe with drugs using my reasons not to do it. That was a sure way for me to lose. Drugs don't play by those rules. They won't fairly exchange blows with you wearing gloves. They have a gun.

If I was parked outside a liquor store, figuring out and reasoning why I shouldn't go in and get my drugs I was already on the way to fail.

So what did I do? My slow reasoning punches with gloves were no match for a gun with instant emotion. I had to became a gunslinger. Faster draw than the drugs.

You see I don't entertain any thoughts or feelings of doing the drugs anymore. I shoot them down instantly. The time for reasoning is over for me.  The time now is for execution. I draw my gun fast without hesitation. No more drugs. Bang!

I believe in reasoning to make the right decision. I carefully spent many days thinking about the pros and cons of doing drugs (not too many pros by the way) and what was best for my life. I am so confident and happy with the decision I made and believe in the reasons for making that decision with not only all my brain but all my heart. I don't have to ever revisit these reasons or use them anymore. I use the emotional belief of how important this decision is to my life. It was a very emotional decision. The emotion and conviction even grows the longer I am sober. This is where the power comes from. And it is near instant. Bang!

&#x200B;

TLDR

1. I used well thought out reasoning over days to decide that drugs weren't making me happy or improving my life so I had to quit them.

First off. I am pretty unsocial. I despise most people and I don't get a long with most people. I have no real friends as a result but that doesn‚Äôt bother me besides not having a gf. That's the only thing that depresses me regarding my social life. I don't care about having tons of friends, its just how I am.

Secondly. AA and recovering from alcoholism isn‚Äôt a thing in Japan. Social drinking also is required to make new friends. I could explain why but it's just how Japan works. No alcohol=no Japanese friends.

I don't understand how listening to other alcoholics in a live setting would help. I hate drinking and I want to stop but it always creeps back and I have to suffer detoxing, insomnia, and feeling like shit again.

So what do I do? I can quit short term obviously but I forget my resolve and get sucked back in.

So tldr, I don‚Äôt want to listen to other people or talk with other people but nothing is working long term. 

tldr I can't do AA but I can't do this alone either. I feel like if I could just do something that takes up hours of the evening without getting boring. 

Fuck I don‚Äôt even know what I am doing. 

I know I'm not drinking tonight though. Guess I'll order a pizza.

I want to get sober but I'm kind of, scared? Like the title suggests I never thought I had a serious problem. I knew I struggled with saying no to alcohol and I would always tell myself ""just drink one beer, you'll be fine"" and then one would turn drinking the entire six pack or an entire bottle of wine. But I've never called myself an alcoholic until now. I'm an alcoholic. I am ready to be sober now.

The last six months have been the toughest though. My partner and I have been living apart because of our jobs/lack of housing since February. He's my rock and while we were living together we were able to work on not drinking together. He's been sober since he moved away and I just got worse and he doesn't even know. He knows that I do drink but he doesn't know the extent and I don't know how to tell him I've been struggling. I do have friends and family that love me and care about me but I don't want to be a burden and alcoholism very much runs in my family but I don't know how to reach out to them.

I want to be sober. I am tired and I can see the damage I'm doing to myself. I'm also very scared and I wish I could explain why. Like the thought of never drinking alcohol ever again is a very stressful and I find myself asking what I'm going to do in future social situations because I used alcohol to cope with anxiety.
I'm basically rambling at this point and I apologize for that, but I'm ready to have the alcohol-free life that I want.

While I acknowledge this isn't the best way to start a new life for yourself, I knew how unhappy I was, working 6 days a week, never seeing my family. I was starting to not take care of myself and could see the addictive behavior starting to take hold again. While I didn't relapse or even slip and take a sip I just knew it was time to go. 
.
I quit and walked away relieved. Due to an injury that I have surgery scheduled for I didn't give a two weeks. I informed my manager it was bad for my physical and mental health to remain employed and handed her the key. 

All of this sounds backwards to me as I type this out but I left a job honestly, told the truth about why I could no longer remain employed and it had nothing to do with alcohol. 

Instead of being at home wasted waiting until the money runs out I am planning a better future for myself. I know I will need to go get a job to tide me over eventually but right now for the first time since I was maybe 13 or 14 I am genuinely excited for what my life may hold.

You know how it is.  You've had a few days of drinking.  Maybe a few weeks.  Look, maybe a few months.  It's building, the gathering storm of tiredness, stress, anxiety, stomach pains, headaches.  And so on, on a Tuesday (it's never a Monday because Sunday night is still the weekend, so you can still drink, right?), you say - no more!  Time to stop.  Time for a break.

Tuesdays, for me, without drinking, are easy.  I already feel bad so I just let myself go to bed.  I wake up on Wednesday and I feel FANTASTIC.  I've had a good sleep, I've eaten, my thoughts are clear.  So when the end of the work day rolls around, why wouldn't I just have a glass?  Why not?  Just one, or a couple.  Whatever.  I feel fabulous.  No hair of the dog here.

And so, the second day crumbles away.  Day Two is a failure, yet again.

but what happens when i start to appreciate and value my relationship far more when it has the potential of two sober participants instead of one? i don‚Äôt want to take on others habits and energy and influences primarily concerned with drinking alcohol. i do love this person so much. but when he drinks he doesn‚Äôt love himself. and i can‚Äôt do it for him. trust me. i‚Äôve tried so many times to no success. 

i‚Äôve found that even short term sobriety can be a beautiful introduction to learning self love. it‚Äôs the biggest way i‚Äôve grown into where i am today. and i can say i love this Self much better than the one who hid behind the bottle.

I thought this is probably the place to post this and am interested in how others how managed with their past shitty behaviour when drunk.

I like to think I never had an issue with drinking per se, for the most part I'd just have two to four beers each day, feel groggy the next day, rinse and repeat. However, my real issue was when I did get drunk it was out of control drunk and I would engage in a highly self-destructive behaviour with no care of consequences or what my behaviour did to others. Hence why I'm a silent user of this sub and coming on 8 months sober in a large part thanks to people's stories on here getting me through the early days which were the hardest in breaking the habit I had.

Anyway, now that I am sober, and have been working on self care, reflection and just trying to be the good person I know I am and want to be, I'm now at a point where I'm wanting to move on with my life and own my prior actions without feeling complete and utter shame. Part of this involves making new friends and explaining why I don't drink and other parts involve romantic interests.

However, and particularly on the romantic interest part, I'm struggling to reconcile some of the things I've done when drunk, think cheating, and being able to genuinely believe I'm a better person now sober. I mean it'd be pretty cowardly of me to just blame alcohol and not own those actions.

A lot of stuff happened when I wasn't an adult or in my very early adulthood and I'm trying to just forgive myself for those mistakes as best I can but my last relationship and how I ruined that through drinking and why that is a large factor in me being sober is something I feel I have to be open about and own, particuarly with potential new romantic relationships so they can make an informed decision about what that means for them.

Anyway, I don't know when to have the real in depth chat with people why I don't drink anymore and am terrified of the outcome etc. However, its the right thing to do and I have to live with the consequences so here I am.

TLDR: how to be frank with new friends and relationships about the main reason you don't drink is because you can be a pretty awful person when you do.",6,0

I even thought about posting it on /tifu, but I guess that sub is about funny stories and this is not a funny story at all. This is my day 1 being completely sober and I know it's going to be rough.

I've been drinking since I was 14 and I never really stopped. When I was young I could drink anything, I'd never lost control or pass out. It's not like I was drinking everyday so I never thought I had a problem. I could go to parties and not drinking and it used to be fine.  I don't know when it all changed.

During the pandemic I started noticing how lonely I was and started drinking alone almost everyday. After a while I started meeting people again and it didn't change, I kept drinking. I lost control for the first time in my life and I started fucking up my relationship with a lot of friends.

I decided to use MDMA for the first time and I passed out. The next day people told me what I've done. Instead of solving my problems with my friends I vanished. Even tho some friends said they were open to talk about what happenned I never went after them. I regret so much.

It was a hard time between me and my girlfriend (we've been dating for 5 years) since I basically cheated on her by sexually harassing a very close friend of mine at the MDMA occasion. I never thought I was even capable of doing what I did. Even tho I still did it. And it was hard accepting it.

I talked about the harassment with my friend and she claims to be fine now. We were very close and decided to pause our friendship at least for a while. I don't know when I'll grow balls enough to talk to her again. Yet I kept drinking.

Yesterday I blacked out again. I hope it's the last time. 

I probably destroyed my relationship with the friends I had left since they don't answer my texts. 

I'm probably breaking up with my gf soon. I can't handle the pain I'm making her go trough with my drinking issues.

A couple of hard seltzers turned into some shots of tequila and before I knew it I had woke up in my bed at 3:30 AM having no idea what happened over the past 10 hours.( sidenote: I always have been the sloppy type when drunk) Turns out during the time I was blacked out drunk, I had said some nasty comments to someone over social media, got picked up by my friend to go over to his house, and ended up throwing stuff at him, falling into bushes, and throwing up all over his yard. I also accidentally stole some of his clothes that were in his car when he was dropping me off (at 9 PM only 2 hours later because I was so hammered) I also saw that I had sent a message on snapchat to one of my future roomates and I believed I had said something super mean to her on snapchat (because I get aggressive when I drink). So the past 3 days I have been stressing the fact that they hate me and being so embarrassed and ashamed, and then today I get a text from them and it turns out the nasty comment I thought I said when I was blacked out, I never said!

So, I took 5 days off last week and I haven‚Äôt felt so connected to myself and my partner in such a long time.

I listen to the Take a Break podcast all the time but I still have the cravings and urges. I wasn‚Äôt physically dependent at all but I used alcohol significantly as a coping mechanism for the past 5-ish years. I‚Äôm 23 now and I hate to admit it but it feels like alcohol has already taken so much from me.

So I decided to stop drinking, cold turkey, after a huge fight with my gf. She was away last weekend to go see her family ... and of course I indulged, 2 bottles of whisky and one of vodka, one for each day. Of course when she comes home yesterday afternoon, I was still a little bit drunk, but pretexted I was tired because I took a medecine for stomach pain. I don't think she believed me but I went with it anyway ... Not my first lie about that 

 So this morning I take my last shot from my whisky bottle to ease a bit the huge hangover I had. Behind her back, of course .. 

The morning was a little rough, the usual nausea, chills, slight shaking of hands, sweat .. But I managed to eat a little, took some ibuprofe and just before going to bed I was actually feeling fantastic. Now not so much .. 

I can't close my eyes without seeing images flash at random and very fast. I can't describe it more precisely. Really random too like scenes of movies, trees .. I hear music in my right ear too. Like some rock I think ? All that make it really hard to sleep, and I hadn't sleep last night either ... I had some visual hallucination too mais just a bit, like thinking I saw a mosquito flying by, or a black spot on the wall, nothing the scary stuff some people can see when that's happening to them that I read here ! 

Problem is, I'm freaking out. I read here and there that all that stuff can lead to delirium and I don't what to think or do ? ... Should I just relax and wait for sleep to come with earplugs ? ... Do you think I should worry ? Other than what I have described I feel fantastic

My daughter‚Äôs dad and I, after 12 years together, began to fall apart. With my marriage at an end, postpartum depression, and a loss of identity, I spiraled.

When my daughter was 2 years old I checked myself into rehab. I missed her second Christmas.

My daughter is 5 years old now, and although I have struggle at times, I have continued to make sobriety my top priority.

I‚Äôm back in school for my Masters in Counseling. My daughter and I have our own humble home. She is resilient and incredibly loved.

When my daughter gets older I will be transparent and truthful with her. Her mother is an alcoholic who has seen the darkest depths but has continued to fight. She will learn her mother made mistakes, lost her way, and bottomed out in alcoholism. My daughter will learn this, look at me, and with every bit of wish and hope in my heart she will say ‚ÄúWow Mom, I would have never thought you went through that.‚Äù All she will have known, and all she would have lived, would be a loving, attentive, and SOBER mom.",38,0

Attempted to make myself busy as i felt sadness then anxiety and finally anger rising in me and im not to the point i can just ""sit"" with these feelings yet. 

So i get up, turn music on, and start doing dishes then decide to clean my fridge. OF COURSE there is a 16OZ Budweiser towards the back from whenever. 

Everything turns into this weird time warp like everything slowed down, the music was like a distant echo and all i could think about was downing that beer as fast as I could and then going to store to get a case and a pack of cigs. I could have one more last day. 

Then I was like no no no. The time warp went away the music got loud again and i started doing more dishes. Kept thinking about it. Then I was like shit just go get it and pour it down the drain. Went to grab it and literally could not touch it. Could not accept pouring it out. 

After attempting twice to pour beer out and I couldnt it felt as if someone was controlling me with puppet strings or some shit. I start crying HARD going back and fourth in my head. I try thinking of all the reasons I dont need to drink. Kept saying how i didnt want to be sick tomorrow cause after that one it would be downhill from there especially if it was my ""last night"" to drink. Called myself every name in the book I could think of in an attempt to lower my self confidence so much that i would cave in. 

After what felt like an hour but was only 5 minutes or so i had went back and fourth from sadness to anger in what i think was somewhat of a panic attack. After crying long enough I calmed down. I kept thinking that if I could just bring myself through this i would somehow be stronger. That next time would some how be easier. 

So i opened the fridge, grabbed the beer, and poured it down the drain. It smelled so good. I would like to say I was beaming with pride and so proud but I wasnt. I was disappointed it was so hard for me and I was disappointed that I felt feelings of regret after getting rid of it. 

 Its gone now. No trip to the store and now I can still go to the gym tonight if I feel up to it. The point is i have the choice. 

Just thought i would share and let someone know about the World War 3 battlezone that I just survived in my head.

Hungover today. Yesterday I told myself I was just going to keep it chill. i feel that i didn't even drink that much and behaved but have still felt like ass today and haven't been productive for work. 

i've had cups of coffee today, energy drink, caffeine pill, and am still sluggish. feeling rough after an easy night of drinking. the hard nights of drinking are much worse where i can't eat and have severe upset stomach for a day or two.

I've tried cutting back before and have improved at times but have so much more work to do.

I want to completely stop but not sure if i can. I have a trip planned to vegas with friends in a few weeks and i already know the hangover from that is going to be insufferable. I'm thinking after that trip i take an indefinite hiatus from drinking, maybe stop for good. but i already am thinking in the back of my head of trying to just drink responsibly instead of completely stopping. has anyone here had success with just having a drink or 2 on special occasions?

i have some other vices i need to work on as well, looking at too much porn and spending too much time on the internet. I'm not sure what i should tackle first or if i can somehow improve all 3 together. i know i need to develop more hobbies and have things to replace my extra time with. i do a pretty good job about working out. but being hungover definitely makes my diet and workouts worse.

i think part of my problem is being bored, spending too much time in my apartment, and i feel going out drinking is one of the easiest ways to cure boredom and seeing scenery outside my apartment. 

i've heard people recommend the easy way to stop drinking book by allen car. i started it and need to continue it. going to try to watch some ted talk videos too, been a while since i watched those.

But I came across an additional definition, a follow up to the above, and it read like...

""*...the natural state of every human being when they are born.""*

I thought this was very interesting and I shared it with a friend who was beating themselves up about their addiction and being ""weak"" and a ""failure"". And I said to them...

It's not your fault. Most of us are not born wanting to abuse a substance of any kind. We learned it from somewhere. We inherited it. It was passed on to us somehow. So go easy on yourself. Beating yourself up will only feed the addiction, but if you accept that at one point you did not need alcohol you can get there again.

What do you think?

Firstly, thanks for all the advice and support that I got from lurking, this is actually my first post here as I reckon that I could need some help.

I used to drink 3-5x a week about half a bottle of whisky for the last 5 years but decided to stop as I started to feel that I am going to faint and had trouble breathing after the usual weekend bender.  It feels like a constant cloud around my head that puts me in an almost out-of-body experience, it feels actually more like I am dying instead of just fainting.

This feeling would usually stop after the first day of not drinking, however I am now on day 3 and I just had another feeling faint episode at midday just before lunch. 

Getting some lunch and sugars made it better but I am unable to decide if this is indeed ""just"" alcohol withdrawal or if there is something else wrong with me as well. 

I will see a doctor tomorrow as well, but I would like to know if this something anyone else has experienced?

I also always do it cold turkey way but I am unsure if this is a good idea...

Constantly this week I have been asked to drink. Asked why I'm not drinking. Or informed that there is plenty of booze. All of these people know that I'm not drinking. They dont know how bad I was but they all have been told multiple times in the past and even about 10 times this week that I'm not drinking.

I feel like a broken record. I dont even want to drink or feel like I'm at risk for drinking but it's so emotionally tiring. One of them asked me for the millionth time if I want to drink and if I wanted some whiskey from the liquor store. I said no AND THEY BOUGHT IT ANYWAY. They dont drink whiskey only I did, it was for me even though I said no. (All of it just got thrown in the fucking trash)

Flash forward to yesterday the restarunt we wanted to go to was closed and they decided on an outdoor bar. I wasnt really opposed to it, if they all want to sit and have a beer and enjoy the night air I dont really mind. But this made their comments even worse. I ended up sitting there trying to enjoy myself, nursing an enegry drink I didnt really want but didnt mind having from the bar man. It was a cool night and I was enjoying being outside. Then they start telling our bar man that I dont drink and make it a point of conversation like I'm the butt of some joke.

Today when I was driving one home they again brought it up and said ""well you're over 21 it's weird that you are not drinking when you are in your mid 20s""  I was ready to explode. I guess I'm just venting. I sternly informed them that if they brought it up again after I've told them no like 30 times during the week, that I'd probably be pretty pissed off at them. 

I had a good time outside enjoying some nature and fresh air this week. I was able to take some sunset walks and really get some peace and quiet.

I told myself I'd quit drinking Sunday, that was the last day, and I genuinely meant it. It's now Wednesday and my lifestyle hasn't changed since at all. I'm aware that if I quit I'll feel so much better in the long term, and my life would really honestly be better, but that's way in the future, it doesn't make me feel better in the same way quick self-gratification does.

I work in an obstetrician and gynaecologist‚Äôs office. we have to tell patients on a regular basis that they are binge drinking weekly when they think they are simply consuming a normal amount of alcohol on the weekends.

having more than 3 drinks in a single sitting if you have an estrogen based endocrine system is a binge that is medically significant.

having more than 5 in a sitting is a medically significant binge for someone with a testosterone based endocrine system.

every time you do this, it significantly impacts your risk of getting breast cancer, and damages your liver. it takes time to recover from that liver damage. if you‚Äôre having a 3-5 or more drink binge on a weekly basis, you are an alcoholic, medically speaking, and your liver is not recovering.

again: the bar for what binge drinking is, medically, is so much lower than what you think it is.

alcohol is a really toxic substance and not something you should fuck around with.

again: if you have an estrogenized hormone system (common for most women), then 3 drinks is a binge. if you have a testosteronized hormone system (common for most men), then 5 drinks is a binge.

anything above that number, consumed as frequently as weekly or more, and you‚Äôre medically a binge drinking alcoholic.

also, if you‚Äôre drinking any quantity of alcohol 6 days a week or more, that‚Äôs another threshold at which, medically speaking, you meet the definition of alcoholism. your liver needs more days without alcohol in your system than just one a week to recover and be healthy.

I don‚Äôt say any of this to shame anyone‚Äîto me, alcoholism or substance use disorders aren‚Äôt a sign of weakness or moral failing. and most of us genuinely don‚Äôt know this stuff.

rather‚ÄîI point this out because it‚Äôs important to reduce harm, and find ways to live healthier, happier lives. there is a life outside of constant binge drinking. it‚Äôs not always easy to find it. but it‚Äôs out there. you deserve a life where your emotional needs are met by something other than alcohol, and a life in which your liver is healthy, and the ways you cope and celebrate and find joy don‚Äôt put you at increased risk of cancer.

addicts deserve accurate medical information regardless of what they decide to do with it. for some people, losing liver function is worth the benefits they get from binge drinking, but they can‚Äôt make that choice if they don‚Äôt know what the consequences are to begin with.

I can spend weeks, even months, being sober only to quickly forget the regret and shame I had felt after my last late night binge with some old friends.

I also believe I‚Äôve spent much of my life caring way too much about what others may think‚Ä¶or more so what they may say of me if they learn of my desire to remain sober.

Former heroin addict turned alcoholic (swapped one for another). I quit drinking recently because every time I drank, I'd have a pain in my right side for a few days after. Sometimes it would come and go, sometimes it would stay for a while.

Had blood work done, ALT was 65 and AST was normal, about 5 days after my last drink. When the pain would get bad, I'd feel it in my back.

So, I had an ultrasound. I went pretty hard for a few years (morning until night), not so hard for a few more (just at night after work), every other day for a few more after that. I do feel better now that I haven't drank for a while; the pain is gone. I didn't have jaundiced eyes, itchy skin, swelling, or anything like that.

I do admit I have health anxiety (and anxiety in general, which is most of the reason I would drink or use drugs in the past), so I'm just worried about what will happen tomorrow. I've since been put on anxiety meds and they've helped a lot.

I don't know what I'm really looking for here, I guess just a place to vent to people who might understand the worry.

Sat I drank, Sunday I drank. Around 8-10 drinks each day, towards end of day. Monday came, I got slightly sick. Nothing like the past though, thankfully. However, I \*KNEW\* If I didn't drink something within several hours , I was going to be sick as crap Monday evening. Monday morning, I made a plan, and I stuck with it, have a drink in late afternoon, then later on in evening. Then stop. That's EXACTLY what I did. 

I had to ween off, or as I call it ""Stair stepping it"". It's my technique of you drink too many days in a row, you get sick. Instead of a gradual doing 12 one day, 11 the next, and just drinking for many days to ween off - I did the take a drink, wait a few or more hours, have another one then later go to bed and see how it is in morning. Well, glad I did that as school starts, and nothing worse driving people to school and feeling like trash. I felt TIRED as shit but I wasn't hungover. My stairstepping was what saved my ass, otherwise I feel like I would have missed out. 

My point in all this, is I 'figure out' ways to keep the party going. My stair stepping so to speak works, and I know it works. However, I don't want to 'figure it out' anymore. I don't want to plan ways to 'come down', I've done this WAY to much and I'm really tired of it. It's day 2 so far and other than being tired, I'm alright.

The other night I lay in bed, and was very much aware of the pistol beneath it. I have always been plagued by the idea that suicide is an ""option"" ever since I saw friends and family succumb to it while I was younger. Despite everything that's been going on in my life, I've been relatively positive, hopeful, even. Because a future exists in which I am happy, many of them, in fact. I only need the courage and strength to walk those paths.

And yet, my thoughts lingered on that pistol. I've cried more in the past month than I have my entire life. Thank my stoic upbringing for tears not shed in youth, and thank my adult self for learning that emotions are not to be stifled, but felt and experienced. My entire life has been thrown up into the air, my seemingly well-ordered deck of cards unceremoniously thrown into chaos like so many games of 52 card pickup. And for the first time, in a long time, I thought about not picking them up. 

But I stopped myself from thinking on it too much. I said, ""it is night, and I've had a really bad day, and in the morning, the sun will shine through the windows, and I will feel better."" And I practiced sweeping those thoughts from my mind, envisioning some disembodied hand sweeping those thoughts, like bread crumbs, from the kitchen counter of my mind. and when they returned, I practiced sweeping them off again. and soon, I was able to fall asleep.

And in the morning, the sun did shine out all the brighter.  I had my breakfast and my coffee, and I sit to traipse through the garden of reddit for a while. I've recently begun speaking to an old friend who's also entering sobriety, and he's getting back into running, which has inspired me to do the same. I decided I would stop checking my email for the letter telling me I finally have a job, and go run through these emotions. Clean the bad day from out my pores with sun glistened sweat.

Went for a trail run, a good run, and came back to a voicemail from one of the companies I had been interviewing with, they wanted me to call them, I did so immediately, and although the signal was spotty I heard her say ""We'd like to offer you the position for..."" and that's all I heard before I let out a triumphant whoop that must have startled my fellow park goers. I was so happy I called my mother, my father, my grandmother, my little brother, my friends, and just about everyone I could think of. 

After many congratulations, I hung up the phone and hit up my local grocery store before returning home. At the deli counter, I passed some store-made treats with fun, decorative, plastic rings embedded within them. I paused, and then queried the deli worker about them. Previously, to celebrate my 666th day of sobriety, I had a cookie cake made here, and it came with those rings. I asked the worker if I could buy some for fun. She laughed at my question, replying ""I don't know if you could tell, but I was having a terrible day, thanks for the laugh."" She gave me a few, and I was about to walk away, when I stopped. I thought I recognized her. I turned around.

""Hey, I don't know if you remember me, but I had a sobriety cookie made here..."" 
""yeah, 666 days, I remember.""
""Yeah! well, I was ashamed when I got it made, it wasn't for a friend, it was for me. You included a note, saying that it was a big deal, and I have that note on my fridge still to this day. I look at it when I need a boost.""

She then told me she was proud of me. That it *was* a big deal. She knows, because she's an alcoholic. We stood there, for a few minutes, among the throng of shoppers coming and going, and we talked. *Really* talked. She wants to get sober, wants to be free of it. I told her I understood. That I'd help if I could. I gave her a business card from my long dead business, ""text me if you want to talk about it.""

I don't know if I helped her, but she helped me. And if I hadn't made it through that bad night, I wouldn't have been there to help anyone.

I'm a 24 y.o French guy and i've never drank daily, but I never missed a week end for like 8 years. 

10 days ago I had a night out with some friends, one of them brought ecstasy. I had never tried it. 
Long story short after a few drinks I took a tiny little bit of that candy lookalike pill and there I go. 
I spent a good night, dancing like no one's around, light were amazing, etc... All of the sudden that was way too much, my body turned off but my mind was at 101% capacity. Thought a lot but can't remember much. 

The morning after I was feeling great but my body was feeling strange. As after each night out I thought to myself ""that's it I'm done with drinking for my whole life!"" but this time the idea stuck with me. 
It's been 10 days, I don't feel much of a difference but I wanna see how far I can go. 

Is an occasional consumption possible? Is it better to stop it once and for all? Is once in a while a ""good"" thing? 
There are so many questions on my mind, and all of my friends are drinkers. I always am looking for reconnaissance/acceptance from them , I'm afraid to lose them if I stop drinking. 
Any advices?

In AA we say ""one is too many and a thousand are not enough.""  That was me, and that saying was one of the reasons I took to AA despite having ALL the issues.  That, and the miracle of the titty bar which I will link to later.

I had a faulty off switch.  One drink led to another despite all my good intentions.  I went to great lengths to support my denial.  I remember being in a newly opened wine store and discovering they had 1.5 liter bottles.  (I was drinking wine because whiskey and gin put me into walking, talking blackouts during which I thought i was in the woods and was prone to piss in the corner of the living room.)

With the new larger size I could revert to saying I just had one.  And that one was pretty much enough to make me pass out (and not get up)

I was 39, still had job, house, marriage (though she was not happy about my pissing in the corners and other things). I was functional!!! Never arrested, never woke up with someone whose name I did not know - but occasionally with people I should not have been in bed with.

Friend called me after a breakup essentially telling me he was going to kill himself. Spent about an hour talking to him and trying to get him to call and get help etc. Not really sure what happened to that. He wanted me to go drinking with him, which I declined and said I'd be glad to hang out and talk. He didn't really want to do anything after that, so I'm not sure what happened. Made sure to bring up hanging out a few times but he didn't seemed interested. 

Didn't sleep much either. Had a nightmare that me and my mom died in a car accident because I was drunk and couldn't drive. She's not the best at driving at night. In the dream we ended up driving off a bridge, and I was too out of it to break a window open or get the doors open. Woke up in a panic, so that was fun. 

So not much good to say other than somehow I made it. Still have a headache too. 

Also can I just say, quitting drinking while having a full time job is insanely difficult. It's hard enough as it is, but just accepting no real good sleep for a while, emotions all over the place, and all the other things that come with the first week or so, all while getting up and working for 8 hours? It's nutty.",5,0

I'd love to share some of my accomplishments with you guys.","Before I quit drinking I couldn't even fathom existing without alcohol. Now it seems to be just the opposite. The past year has been the best time of my life and I'd love to share with you some of the things that I've accomplished!:

-I went from about 215 lbs to 165 lbs! I had been overweight since childhood and for the first time in my life I can confidently say that I'm at a healthy weight and it literally feels like a dream come true. I like the way I look now for the first time ever. I also changed my diet to be whole food and plant based and that has helped *so much*.
Face pictures are from a month before I quit drinking to today. I didn't have any full-body comparison pictures because when I was overweight I was too embarrassed to take pictures of myself.  http://imgur.com/a/spylue2


-I got a promotion at work! I can't say for certain, but I'm pretty confident that I wouldn't have been offered the position when I was drinking because my performance at work was pretty poor due to constant hangovers.

-I bought a truck that I had wanted for years! This is my first time owning a vehicle in about 4 years. I could never really drive before quitting drinking because I was almost always intoxicated.

-I adopted a cat! I couldn't trust myself to be responsible enough to care for a pet back when I was drinking.

-I began my first ever healthy romantic relationship with a wonderful person that I love immensely.

-I moved out of my crappy apartment and into a house with my friends who are also alcohol-free and it's fantastic! I love them so much and I love living with them.


And just to top that all off- I finally have the energy and motivation to spend my free time exploring nature, exercising and spending quality time with the people I love as apposed to sitting at the bar for hours every day after work. My life has changed so dramatically and I couldn't possibly be happier. Thank you all for being such a wonderful community and taking the time to read this. üíú IWNDWYT",525,0

I spend every day and feel like I have a perma-hangover that never goes away. Hangaxiety and melancholy sadness are off the charts which causes me to drink again at random points in the day sometimes the first thing in the morning. I feel great and at peace when drinking for about 1 hour and waste time listening to music reflecting on past events. I've been getting nothing done lately, and sometimes have to lie in bed doing nothing for long periods because of physical and mental pain. All the beer started stripping my GI system like paint thinner. I quit drinking scotch because that hurts me more and I have poor self-control with it. I really hope my belly isn't distending with edema which I know to be a sign of liver problems and impending organ failure. I'm not sure the amounts I'm drinking are that insane, last time I went to the hospital for a similar problem which is my neuropathy last year and they said my withdrawal was pretty mild because I wasn't really shaking that much but internally felt mentally, physically, and spiritually sick. The same way I feel now. I quit drinking for 3 or 4 weeks when I was staying with my family. Which was great and memorable. I was so happy. Someone gave me some ambien which made me feel great and I slept great as well, didn't wake up with a hangover like now. I could even skip days of taking it, but of course I started taking it until it was gone for 15 days every night. Wish I had more of those or benzos as I would rather take a fraction of a pill and be able to sleep well and be refreshed. I have gapapentin but when I mix those with alcohol it starts to have very strange CNS effects which I hate, and it does make me shake. It would only help me if I could dedicate myself to quitting. Want to quit, can't commit. I don't want to go to the hospital or detox because I have a lot of medical bills. I don't want to tell my parents that I need to go to detox again either.

It's caused a lot of hurt and the demise of relationships, jobs, friends and no matter how many times I tried to stop, I would always end up at the bottle shop looking for a solution to my problems on the shelves. For years people tried to get me to stop and for years I would continue to come to work everyday hungover, waste my weekends on getting drunk and cry into a glass of red as I noticed my life deteriorating, only to repeat the cycle weekly.
Last Friday I hit a new level of rock bottom to the scariest point I'd ever experienced. My boyfriend and I went out of town for a night away as a step towards fixing our fragmented relationship. I had one shot too many and blacked out only to wake up in a cell, not knowing how I got there, if I was being charged for anything and if I was getting out and why my hair reeked of vomit. In the morning the cops said they responded to a call from our hotel because a woman in one of the rooms was yelling hysterically. They found me naked in the bath crying and covered in vomit and screaming that my boyfriend hit me, (he didn't!) so they took me back to the police station to sleep it off, while bf had to pay $300 to have the carpet cleaned and sleep in his car.
I have never felt so ashamed in my life, but it was the kick in the arse catalyst I needed for me to finally look at myself and recognise that I needed to make some changes.
I haven't drank since that night- 10 days which is the longest abstinence from alcohol I've had in my life. I never thought this was possible but I guess this horrible incident was a blessing in disguise. Months ago my friend bought me The Naked Mind and Quit Like a Woman by Holly Whitaker, which I never bothered to really read until now because only now am I really ready and willing to do the work and visualise a life of sobriety. 
Reading everyone's posts and stories has really helped me not to feel alone and so I just wanted to share myself and let anyone who needs to know or who can relate that I'm here and I'm trying just like you and I'm gunning for you and anyone who is feeling the struggle, be it the ache of looking in the mirror or the pain of fighting the urge.

Things were great for the first 9 months of sobriety, or at least mostly great. I got into intensive therapy, learned meditation. But things have been getting worse for the past 5 weeks or so.

\-- I am living off savings and they will be gone in about 6-8 months. I haven't worked full-time in years. One reason I feel like relapsing is that I started a new online project and while it's helping, it's nowhere near what I need to survive, and I thought I could just do it full-time. I'm ashamed and feel like a failure. The addict voice in my head tells me: ""Hey, I thought getting clean and sober was supposed to solve all your problems? I thought you were supposed to just magically be working at your dream job as soon as you stopped drinking!"" A part of me just wants to revert to the old plan: drink the next 8 months of money away and then find a way to off myself.

\-- I am completely alone in a foreign country. I had one really solid friend (or so I thought) for the last 18 years or so. She lives in my home country. We shared everything, all of our fears, all of our traumas. She's come to visit me multiple times. Then, in the past few months as I've started to get better, set boundaries, etc., she has suddenly been super distant and won't return my texts. She's told me that my whole sobriety thing is ""boring"" and she doesn't want to hear about it; she tells me that the abusive alcoholic guy I was dating who was always pressuring me to drink was ""better than any other guy"" and encourages me to get back together with him. I know she's really stuck in her life and sees my getting better as a threat, but it still hurts. In the country where I live, AA isn't really a thing.

\-- I have started letting the meditation practice slip, the skincare routine slip, and the healthy eating slip. I spend a lot of time in bed. If I started drinking again, then at least I wouldn't be alone. I would immediately have social groups to draw from. I would have events to attend. There would be people I could date.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This week we‚Äôre looking at the inner workings of the sub. We have an amazing community, and that‚Äôs not to be taken for granted! So, what‚Äôs with the **¬´No medical advice¬ª** rule? Certainly my fellow man should benefit from my super duper home detox cold turkey weed snake oil experience?

To put it short: NO. Let me repeat that: NO. If I was unclear: NO. Once again for those in the back: NO.

*Why? Can you explain it like I¬¥m five?*

Absolutely. When we give the brain alcohol, it slowly adapts to handle the steady flow of chemicals. Some parts are numbed, other parts take a rest; they go offline. Why work when booze do trick? When we cut the flow, we experience withdrawals while those parts painfully try to get back in shape. However, sometimes they don¬¥t, and the brain crashes and we have a stroke. This is deadly and can destroy both brain and other organs. Like, for ever. Similarly, if someone who¬¥s been clean for a while suddenly takes the dose they used a year ago - it¬¥s just too much.

This is why we are VERY strict on the ""no medical advice"" rule. The only advice we give is to see a doctor.

*Sheesh, I drank a handle a day and I¬¥m great. Surely I can say that a few beers a day is no big deal?*

Well Mr. Crewcut, thank you for asking! Weighing in at 200 punds with a physical job and drinking since you were 14, what do you know about the physique, habits, history, chemistry, tolerance and medical predispositions of an anonymous redditor? Or, to put it short, NO.

*Dude! How about other substances, man? It¬¥s legal now...*

Suffice to say that we the mods are as open minded and diverse like the rest of you. Still the rule extends to promoting substances including but not limited to cannabis, (medical) marijuana, mushrooms, benzos, kava, kratom, etc. Some find them useful, others find that they‚Äôre just new forms of addiction with new sets of unwanted consequences. We don¬¥t advocate or admonish the use of non prescription drugs in recovery, however, please remember these substances are illegal in many parts of the world, and r/StopDrinking has a worldwide member base. There are subs dedicated to most drugs, both for discussion and for recovery.

*Hear, hear! This sounds like years of condensed wisdom, just like my group, which you should definitely -*

Ah yes, but we do not promote specific recovery ideologies either, whatever they may be. We recognize their value, but the ensuing discussons tend to bring more harm than good, and it all boils down to the fact that there is no single fix that works for everyone.

Finally: **While do not advice or promote, we DO share our experience. We do want healthy, open discussions even about hot topics.** Seriously! Just remember to speak from the I, and when it gets heated, be kind.

I am so fed up of waking up with a hangover every morning, going to work with the intention of never drinking again. By the evening the hangover is forgotten and I start drinking again.

My problem is it's so easy, I work in a restaurant and one of the perks is I can basically drink as much house wine as I want. And it's never just one drink it's a huge glass or two at work. And then it's beers or more wine on the train home. And then stopping by a pub for another one or two. 

I'm done. Completely done I dread to think of the damage I have done to my body. And the wasted days that have just disappeared in drunken haze. It's like I'm not even a person anymore.

I don't drink everyday. I don't even feel like I need alcohol a lot of the time.

HOWEVER, one drink opens the floodgates for me. Once I have one, I get drunk, then I will drink again the next day and the day after that. It's starting to take me longer and longer to break this cycle - the decision to have a beer on Friday night creates a chain reaction of binging that goes well into the middle of the next week now. That's alcoholism and that is only going to get worse if I don't quit now for GOOD.

One drink makes me put myself in places I would never go or want to be in when sober. I start calling up old ""friends"" who I know are bad news, meeting up, doing drugs that I swore I would never do again and wouldn't have ever done in the first place unless I was drinking.

On another day 1 today after a completely avoidable bender that left me with crippling anxiety. This day one is different though, I know what I am capable of after that first drink and it honestly scares the hell out of me. I used to feel like I am in control, now I have no clue where a night with some ""casual beers"" at home is going anymore. The ""best case scenario"" for what a day after drinking looks like for me is now starting to slowly become worse and worse.

The only thing that is still pulling me down is my drinking. 

I started drinking when I was a teenager, it was very occasional through my 20s as I was more interested in cannabis, but slowly that interest drifted toward the alcohol. In all the years I‚Äôve been doing this I realize now that I have not quit more than just a couple weeks at a time, and that‚Äôs been a long time ago. 

I am starting to get a slight nudge in my right side which I know is my liver. I was going to the doctor for a physical every year and I would quit a week or so before and pass the test with flying colors, but now I‚Äôve been afraid to go, it‚Äôs been over a year and a half since my last physical. 

I know a lot of young people post here and I think it‚Äôs great to do this as early as in life as possible, and trust me, if you don‚Äôt you just build the addiction to be stronger. I have realized as I get older I am running out of time to have a decent life for my retirement, I plan to retire in eight years and I am starting to realize even more every day that I will either not make it or I will not be in good shape to enjoy. 

So here I am at day two, I‚Äôve done this a few times and I know it takes about five days or so to start feeling pretty good and after a couple weeks even better. I have to get through these dark moments and move into the shining aspect of sobriety. 

The first three days are the toughest in my opinion as for me I go through night sweats, irritable anxiety, and also not sure if anyone‚Äôs ever had this but I can have itchy feet and legs, like pins, it usually hits somewhere in the evening, my feet will itch and my legs, it goes away in a couple hours. I think it‚Äôs the liver dumping toxins but after three days most of that stuff is gone. 

It‚Äôs crazy and insane to go through this every time and not learn that it‚Äôs time to give this up and move on, I‚Äôve had my share I don‚Äôt need any more.
 
I am new here but I have been reading many of your posts and it has really inspired me to do this along with wanting to do this for myself and my family. I am not a big social media type person so you may not see me post a lot but I will be checking in here every day and commenting when I feel I have something to share and I want to help also because sometimes helping others help yourself in return.

(Don't know if needed but just in case) 

I have never posted here but lurked many times. Here goes nothing internet friends...

I never tried to stop drinking because I never even thought I could. Not for real. Sure, I could do a dry month. Sometimes I didn't drink for a couple days. But I always came back. 

I started binge drinking 10 years ago and I never stopped. Of course, 10 years ago I was 19 and it was very ""normal"" behavior to go out drinking every weekend. I thought drinking was what made me fun. I didn't know how to have fun without it. I didn't know who I was without it. I have never had healthy coping skills. I used drinking as a way of escaping, numbing, checking out. 

6 years ago, I got married and moved far away from anyone and everything I knew. (Which would turn out to be blessing, but I didn't know it.) Drinking became my thing to escape loneliness. I didn't need other people around to escape. But as you probably could guess, it didn't make me any less lonely. I didn't know how to sit with my feelings. I couldn't. So everytime I felt scared or lonley or anything, I drank. I drank a lot. I have literally never had ""a drink"" -- I have always drank to get drunk. It often felt like I couldn't control it. 

For a long time, I didn't know what I was escaping. Myself I guess. But recently I found out the reason I had a hole I could never fill. I won't go into all of it, as I'm still learning and I'm still grieving...but I had a traumatic childhood. (Don't we all to some degree?) Sure, my basic life needs were met, I did lots of extra curriculars, on the outside my family seemed fine. The first time I went to therapy I excused my mom's abusive behaviour because of ""cultural"" reasons. I didn't know that everyone's mom didn't give them the silent treatment for days. That everyone's mom didn't rely on them for emotional support. That everyone's mom didn't criticize them endlessly. That everyone's mom didn't call the dramatic for crying as a child. I literally didn't know it wasn't my job to make people feel better. That I didn't have to make myself small. That I didn't have to say yes to things I didn't want to do. That I didn't have to panic when someone was mad. That it wasn't my fucking job to parent a parent...I was so enmeshed for 28 years that I didn't even know why I was so hurt. 

After drunkenly confessing about my past to friends over video chat, I went to the bathroom and passed out on my bathroom floor. My husband, working a night shift came home to find me in a pool of my own vomit. He came home cause my friend called him. I have done some stupid shit while drunk, but I was home alone when I blacked out. I could've died this time. I could've died and I could've never seen anything past this pain I've been holding for my whole fucking life. So the next day, I stopped drinking. 

I'm not gonna lie, it didn't fix all my problems. I don't have it all figured out. But I'm not escaping anymore. I'm living. I've had to sit with BIG feelings. With grief. I've had to stand up to my narcissistic mother. I've had to be sad and lonely and hurt. I've cried a lot. I've shared a lot. But everytime I've chosen to sit with feelings instead of escaping, I've survived. The feelings have passed. I've survived every single feeling. And that's truly something I never thought I could do. 

100 days ago I decided to live again, to feel again...here's to 100 more.",29,0

My birthday was last weekend and I ended up drinking too much and having a breakdown like I usually do when I drink too much, and of course I ruined the trip for my boyfriend.

I've been sober for periods of times, longest was 6 months, but I always seem to think I can moderately drink or just go hard once in awhile and have everything end up fine. Nope lol never works.

I'm extremely lonely and isolated between this and having chronic health issues. I'm still trying to rebuild relationships with friends that have suffered over the years because of me isolating when I'm depressed. Being quarantined for covid last year was a good excuse not to see anyone for awhile but now that everyone is out living their lives like normal, I'm feeling even more isolated, depressed, and overall just super down about myself and hopeless about my life.

I feel like I have no one who cares about how bad I'm struggling even though I've expressed it to my few closest friends. I know I need therapy, was going for awhile but my insurance changed so now I have to find one that accepts my insurance. But in the meantime I don't have anyone I can really talk to. The one person I thought would be there to support me is cold and distant every time I express that I'm struggling. I thought they'd be the one who'd understand the most since they were there not too long ago, but nope.

Ugh everything just sucks right now, I guess I just needed to rant or have someone to talk to.

The anxiety is just about driving me to the edge. I keep worrying that I've done something crazy like 5 minutes ago when I know I haven't - it's completely irrational. I'll be driving and hit a crack in the pavement and my mind lies to me and tells me I ran over a child and am going to prison when the logical part of me knows that didn't happen, or that while I was in my email I maybe sent a threat to someone when I know I didn't. And I don't have a history of doing these types of things even while drinking, so it makes no sense. The irrational thoughts are like: ""Maybe this happened."" And the rational side says: ""But it didn't."" Irrational side: ""But it could've."" And no I'm not schizo or anything, it's just anxiety fucking with my head. This has happened before when I've stopped drinking and it usually subsides after a week or so but in the meantime it's driving me nuts.

Thank you all so much for the support you‚Äôve given me all of this time. I can confidently say I couldn‚Äôt have done this without you. I still check in here when I‚Äôm doing really bad, when I need some love and real support. You guys are the stuff. The shit. My family.

When I quit alcohol, I thought I‚Äôd have to give up so much. No more fun. Forever missing out or watching people drink whilst feeling green with envy. How could I ever relax again? 

In fact, I‚Äôve found that the total opposite has been true. I‚Äôve gained SO SO much. A countless amount of things and a constant inner peace. 

The reality of quitting alcohol and what you lose when you no longer drink: the terrible all day hangovers, wallowing in bed with the worst anxiety and rushing thoughts through your brain but being too ill to get up and distract yourself, feeling a cloud of shame and doom and wanting the ground to swallow you up when you remember things you did,  feeling twinges in your body and coming to the realisation that your liver probably ain‚Äôt happy, having precious time with your child taken away because your too hungover to be present.

I grew up with an alcoholic mother. We never baked or did my homework together, it was always about the booze. Even today her literal only hobby is drinking when I could list so many of my hobbies. I do so many ‚Äòmummy‚Äô things with my son because I‚Äôm not wasting away my life hitting the bottle. 


It hasn‚Äôt all been smooth sailing as over the last couple years life has thrown me some whoppers. My dad developed early onset dementia and got quite ill all of a sudden, and then got heart failure. He‚Äôs not married so I was looking after him completely by myself which I can‚Äôt describe how stressful I found it. I discovered I have a 50% chance of having Huntington‚Äôs disease  (which is progressive fatal and incurable). I am going through genetic testing for the HD and if I have it my son will have a 50% chance of having it. My son was also recently diagnosed with a developmental delay. Sometimes I wonder ‚Äòis this a joke??‚Äô

Last summer I basically had a mental breakdown, I couldn‚Äôt function or leave my house and even being in my bedroom I was shaking. The best way to describe it to someone is that I felt claustrophobic being on this planet. I wanted to just get off planet Earth thank you very much. I wanted to escape. I called my GP in tears saying ‚ÄòI just want to take my son to a funfair‚Äô.. she prescribed me Sertraline and within weeks I was functioning, not functioning but thriving.. I‚Äôll never forget getting stuck in gridlock traffic on the m4 about 2 weeks after I started taking it.. and *not* panicking and thinking about running off into the bushes and never returning? A revelation ü§£ü§£

I take my medication religiously every evening which never would have happened had I been drinking. In 3 years I haven‚Äôt once slept in my makeup, or my contact lenses! I used to do that shit constantly, surprised i never went blind hah.",30,0

Five years without alcohol or drugs. And I think I want to start drinking again. This is because I really don't think sobriety is doing me any favours. Sobriety just seems to be slowly chipping away at my mental health, leaving me exhausted without any real way to relax. The fight with the demons of temptation is awfully tiring.

So I was wondering if a sober alcoholic can ever just decide to start drinking again? Not like the old wild ways. But a more reasonable and moderate manner like everyone else perhaps. Or maybe like the wild ways once in a while, who knows. Just like regular people do! I mean I'm sure I'm just being nostalgic. I can't even remember what a hang over feels like. But still, I sometimes look back at the last five years and think how drinking would have made everything so much easier. All that I have endured doesn't seem to have made any difference. If anything, sobriety just made things harder. 

Now I am struggling to imagine staying sober forever and ever and ever. I am so tired and yet I am struggling to sleep. My personal circumstances are largely irrelevant. But sobriety really doesn't seem to be leading me to the promised land of deep meaningful connections and peace. I just feel so stressed all the time. I would just like a beer or a glass of wine on a weekend every now and again. Something to take the edge off.

So what do you think? Is five years long enough for an alcoholic to learn how to drink responsibly? Does it really even matter anymore? Maybe weed is the answer. But I feel like I need something. My girlfriend says i should take anti depressants but I don't see the damn difference. Maybe I can sober up again if I ever have kids....",14,0

If you are anything like me, I suffer from instant gratification. Since the day I was born, I expect changes overnight, I don't know why I am like this, but I am. It took a long time to realize this was not exactly a strength.

Let me give you an example. In my mid-20s I started a pretty intense workout regimen. After two days, I looked in the YMCA mirror, didn't see ripped abs and biceps, and I quit. Yup.

So I knew I had to be on the lookout of this trait when I quit drinking. I didn't quit drinking so that I could experience changes, I quit drinking because if I continued I would be dead. That's a pretty good motivator.

But for those of you out there, fighting hard each day, you really need to know that the good changes will come, they absolutely will, but they come at different times. And the timelines of course will be different from person to person.  


* I began losing some weight after 4 days
* I began sleeping decent, not as good as I had hoped, after 5 days
* My mental clarity became startingly fantastic after 5 days and continues to improve every day
* My energy became much better after 12 days
* My sleep began getting dramatically better after 20 days ... I even do whole body stretches upon waking, something I don't think I've done in *decades*
* I'm not gonna lie, my temper was quite bad in the first 10 days. But that quickly changed around day 12 and as I type this I have been feeling quite relaxed since day 15. As an example, my teenager had an outburst today, and I never raised my voice, I *instinctually* felt that I should not raise my voice and make the situation worse. I've never experienced this rational thinking before as I had been so used to flying off the handle. Is this how normal people are supposed to behave??? (asking this to be somewhat funny, but also serious)

Out of all the dotpoints above, it is the mental clarity that I have found to be the most dramatic. I would even use the adjective *incredible*.

If you got this far, I ***need*** to fight this, and I want to continue the good fight with you all ... and you need to know the great changes come but they all have different timelines.

And if you have the instant gratification trait as I do ... ***don't let this trait discourage you!*** Because the changes will come to you, and you will be soooooooo pleased.

Hang in there you all. I love this forum.",2,0

But this post is not about that. Instead, this is about what I have learned about myself, what I can sum up in six simple words: **lies, damn lies, and alcohol abuse**

I can't get over the lies I used to tell myself. It's so easy to see that with clear eyes now but when I was in the thick of it I actually believed the bullshit that my poisoned mind fed me on a daily basis. I created an anonymous account to post this because I was worried that this post would be a dead giveaway about who I am. Then I realized... maybe it describes a lot of us? I'll offer some of mine and would like to hear some of yours. Chances are good that I may already be familiar with them.

My lies:

* I'm not like those losers whose lives are falling apart - I am successful in my career, respected by those I work with, own my own home and have a growing family.
* I now buy mostly IPAs and strong beers - boy do I love the taste of a good craft beer.
* I prefer box of wine - then I don't have to worry about opening an *entire* bottle (and who's counting?)
* I'm not embarrassed to go into the same liquor store every day - I just like driving out of my way to other stores to access better selection.
* I'm really fine to drive tonight - I didn't really even drink much (yet), just a four pack of craft tall boys over what, four to five hours?
* I ""somehow"" get and maintain a second wind most days that can last deep into the evening after being dead tired and my body was screaming for sleep - I'm just a night owl.
* I only drink to enhance social situations - grabbing another drink while texting my friends (or anyone else that is still awake) while alone in the dark on the couch at 2am is ""social"".
* I have really bad seasonal allergies (always the seasonal allergies) - that's why my eyes are often puffy and why I often look like shit, especially early in the day.
* I just have poor genetics - that's why I'm aging faster than I should be.
* I have a Dad bod - I am a Dad after all!
* I have no energy - I have a stressful job and again, I am a Dad!
* I often have to get up with my young kids in the middle of the night due to nightmares etc. - that's why I always look sleep deprived.
* I have a weak constitution - that's why I'm constantly fighting health issues like heartburn, digestive issues (especially in the mornings), migraines and flareups of gout-like symptoms.
* My body doesn't handle actual illness very well (and also I coincidentally have never even heard of alcohol withdrawal) - that's why my family members always recover so much faster even when we all get the same sickness.
* I don't read or write anymore like I used to - it's just another creative block that will pass.
* I have to re-watch episodes of TV shows that I watched late at night - I must have been really tired.
* I don't trust anyone that doesn't drink - it is them that has a problem with drinking, not me.
* I have always been good at maintaining human relationships - I just often don't have a good judge of character at first.
* I'm going to live until I'm 100 - isn't everyone?
* *I am so glad I drank the night before*... **NO, this is where I could always draw the line**, even I didn't lie to myself about that one, not even once.

What about you? Do you identify with any of these? What are the lies you now realize you told yourself?

Well, last month I did every single one of those things (and more!) every day of the month. I'm still doing them with the list growing and growing. I've taken on extra projects that arent daily, I've been more productive at work, and most importantly I've been sober. 

But the biggest difference has been my mindset. For so long I would set myself goals that I never met, make myself promises I never kept, and therefore could never trust myself. I couldnt move forward from that place, I had no ground to walk forward on. 

The shift from trying and failing and letting myself down to feeling proud of my actions has been life changing. Now, I feel so much more capable and willing to take on bigger and bigger challenges because I can actually trust myself to follow through with them.

It's a difficult shift to describe. But I think it came from a place of exhaustion, exhaustion with going around and around the same merry go round and never getting anywhere. I was so tired and out of options that the only path I had was to chose something and stick to it, not only when I felt like it, but all the time, the whole way through. That kind of determination, when I do something even though my mind is giving me a million reasons not to... its addictive almost. It makes me feel limitless. 

Idk how much sense all of that makes, or if its helpful for someone still stuck in the aforementioned cycle. I guess I just wanted to say that there is a way out, it's not an easy change, but oh so worth it.

I have been taking it one day at a time, didn't get too caught up in a small relapse here and there but the last two weeks have been HELL.

I'm such an all or nothing person once I get that initial buzz going. I just can't stop myself. Logic and rationale get thrown out the window. I find myself doing things I would NEVER do sober - I called an old friend two nights ago when I was just drinking at home by myself. I hadn't seen him in a while but I knew he would be drinking and more than likely have a bag of coke with him. I fucking HATE drugs but I have dabbled with powder in the past, never more than a few times a year but still, that's a few times too much!

tl; dr: started drinking a lot in my mid-20s because I'd never thought I was cool, went overboard, became physically addicted, went through hell, kept going, worked on my perspective about myself and the world, realized I'd been cool all along,   
 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Well guys, guess this is it, huh? The big reveal. 

Not so big, really. It all starts pretty conventionally. I'd developed a really bad relationship with alcohol in my mid-20s through a combination of going from hardly drinking at all due to medical issues from 18 on and thinking I had some kind of moral upper hand by not touching it--to getting divorced and then saying fuck it, and drinking whatever I felt like because hey! I was an adult and gosh darn it, drinking was fun! It was crazy how I suddenly had all this confidence I'd never found in myself before. No one would pick me last for the kickball team now! Alcohol had made me the cool girl! Well, so I thought at 25 or so.  

I was a functional alcoholic through college without realizing it (I thought all college kids drank 15 shots every weekend night), while simultaneously battling bulimia and an MMO addiction (both kicked, but was up to 18 hours a day sometimes and drinking at 11am sometimes because hey, I'm gaming already!). Even after a (thankfully failed) suicide attempt, I still started drinking daily again because...what? Because it was fun? Because I liked this trainwreck of a person I'd created better than who I really was? Except, I thought I finally \*was\* me because when I looked in the mirror and I was drunk, I saw someone I thought was cool enough for other people to want to hang out with, to date, to be worthy of others' company.

I just kind of existed like this until around four and a half years ago, I began day drinking more and more regularly out of habit and attempts to stave off the endless hangovers, until hangovers ceased to be possible as I became physically addicted to alcohol. I'm going to stop here for those that don't know this, as I didn't myself until my late 20s and have found many others don't know either: 

ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL CAN KILL YOU. 

I'm not going to go into the horrors of it, r/tooktoomuch has some excellent, heart-wrenching examples. Just know that alcohol (and for similar reasons, benzos such as xanax) are significantly more dangerous than most people realize when it comes to withdrawal and NEED to be taken seriously. 

Anyway.

Queue my entrance on r/showebeer. I'd gone through some serious heartbreak a few months prior, and bathing when one is depressed is hard enough. So showerbeers became my safe place. Hell, I even became a mod within a few months! Life seemed great! All of a sudden I was meeting and talking to all these people that loved beer as much as I did. That thought I was interesting and had good taste! Some even thought I was pretty! I think it was around then I started believing in beer as part of my identity. Who *was* Signal Drop without a beer in her hand? If the great Arri wasn't always ready for a party? I suddenly wasn't left out anymore like I'd been for much of my younger life. Who would want to give up feeling accepted and liked for who they are, or at least, who they think they are?  


Well, it wasn't until much more recently I realized that beer is absolutely not who I am, even if it's something I love. I once read on reddit that ""Day drinking is the road to hell,"" and l can confirm that from experience. The only way I can describe it is that you know you're dying. You know your organs are failing you and you can see it every time you look in the mirror and see the light fade a little more from your eyes.  At this point I managed to hold a job down for two years before being canned for essentially being a drunk. And I was. And it wasn't getting better, because at *that* point I'd had the brilliant idea to start to make a living on doing beer-related things. 

So now I was physically and financially-dependant on alcohol. I let it make me it's bitch and I was getting reamed daily harder than Riley Reid on a Blacked set. I drank vodka or whiskey from morning til night, with as much craft beer and wine as I could afford to pepper in. I'd roll over into the bottle at 3am to take a shot or two just so I could sit up for a moment. I still don't know how I accomplished anything over those last few years. Blacked out every night, in and out of the ER when I decided it was a good idea to drink a handle in a day. Eventually some stuff happened where I needed to move (not actually of my causing), and I decided to move to my dream city--Chicago. The morning I was going to send in my lease paperwork for my new place, I saw myself coming home from a brewery, one too many in like I'd been so many times, headed home on the L, blacking out like I'd done more times than I could count on the bus, in my Ubers...and then there was nothing. No future left for me. No grand adventures left for Arri. I'd be a statistic, and death would probably have been preferable to what I would have encountered.

So I called my mom, and said I'm going to rehab. And with my family's help, I did. 

My rehab story is a wild tale unto itself, so I'll just say I spent 1 week in detox, and then about 2 months in what I'll admit was a nice rehab compared to where a lot of folks go. I was incredibly blessed in that respect and didn't take it for granted. For two months. I learned. I listened. I thought about the person I'd become who I knew wasn't me, but whom I couldn't seem to shake because...well....who was I? And I began the process of re-discovery. Without going into the neurobiology behind it, my goal was to enter rehab and work on my  neuroplasticity so I could once more look at alcohol as something that could be consumed in moderation, and not the be all end all of my life. I'm proud to say that a year later, I'm full-steam ahead with progress on my goal. My life is finally starting to go in the direction I saw it taking as a child, before I let the perils of reality seep in and turn me into something I wasn't. My plan has always been to be able to drink again, and I know when I choose to do so in the future, I'll be prepared. When alcohol has become an afterthought, I'll be ready. And if, just if I find it's too much for me to fight that craving when I do return? That I have to fight it at all? Well, then we had a good run. One day, I'll give myself one more chance at the ""fun"" I thought I'd missed out on for so long, that I never ended up having to begin with. Not yet though. :)

In the end...I think the real reason I drank so much is that I couldn't look myself in the mirror and say I loved the person I saw. That I loved the legs that walked me to Trader Joe's so I could buy all my new beer, my nose that smelled the wonderful notes of papaya and fresh cut grass, and this wild mind that never. stops. creating. 

So I started with the question: ""Why don't I love myself as much as Kanye loves Kanye?""

And went from there. 

So, r/showerbeer, you ask why I've stop drinking for now?  


So I could find me again. Get her healthy. Get her making music. And get ready to rock and roll. ;)

Peace in.

Usually for me it would have been day drinking from rise to pass out, eating garbage food and feeling exhausted and overheated unless actively drunk.

Well, my sober friends, I‚Äôm happy to report that I stayed clean as a whistle, had a great time and re established meaningful connections with good friends I haven‚Äôt seen since before the pandemic. I had good nutritious food (so important to me to feel energetic and happy), stayed so fucking hydrated with my bubly, and honestly did not miss drinking at all. I swam in the river, appreciated the stars at night and felt so much wholesome goodness overall. I danced until midnight and got good sleeps at night while the debauchery carried on around me until dawn. 

No one even asked about why I was not drinking, I only told one friend when he brought up the fact that he was thinking about quitting. We then had a long conversation about alcohol and anxiety and I told him my life has changed in the last 4 months since quitting, and he said he was going to take a break starting Monday. I can only hope that telling him my story has helped him, as your stories on this sub have helped me.

Normally I would be feeling the depression and other effects of a bender weekend now, but I am sitting here with my tea and book, thinking about (and remembering all the details of!) a great weekend. Feels good, man. Feels real good.

I finally got help and got medication that will help with the panic attacks and relieve some of the urge to drink, and it helped out a lot. Its only been two days on the medication and Iv felt better and have really no desire to drink.

 I already hated it and know its been destroying my life. When the doctor took my blood pressure he said if it was any higher he would have sent me to the hospital. That night I drank so much I was so disappointed in myself. I took the medication that morning and could barely function for the rest of the day. I didnt sleep that night because I woke up after a couple of hours and thought I was having a heart attack. It was a panic attack that even with meds was still really bad. I finally calmed down and just watched tv, and that morning round of medication by noon already started to feel better. Iv been pounding water since this morning and already feel like Im making momentum to take care of myself. Please dont be afraid to seek help! There is no shame in saying ""I need help.""

Please just humor me. Just listen to my story before i fucking lose it. I don't know how to grieve and I cant sleep, i miss my Mom, i miss the love i used to have from all directions. She's fucking dead. The best woman in the world is dead because someone decided to drink something and drive. Of all people, why her? She never, ever did anything bad. My Mom's so innocent. So innocent and sweet.
A few months ago, i was sober. The love of my life decided to leave me, so i relapsed, because i thought i had lost everything. I got sober, for myself and with great determination and hope, a month later.

And then my Mom is killed on my second day sober. I had just written about how i wanted to trust God. It was a beautiful day. And then i saw her little car smashed against the curb. and i knew i lost everything.

 There is no point in being alive. Here i am trying to be sober snd work the steps anyway and i just dont see the point. Im figuring i will go be with her soon so it doesnt fucking matter. But, she would want me to try.
Only a few short days before this,I was at sober living and, because i am diseased and disgusting, i didnt live sober. I just kept drinking secretly. I wallowed in the pain of my breakup knowing i would never, ever be loved again. I drank until the shakes came, i drank until my liver ached, i drank because i deserved to die. Finally, i cried out, ""i need my mom! I need my mom!"" I called her and she didnt even hesitate. 

 And she was wonderful. She held me, she told me i could do this. She never stopped loving me. Her shitty, awful child. She took me home from the sober house and promised me she would take me to meetings, because i have no car and no friends who can help. She said, ""remember what Lin Manuel Miranda said: paciencia y fe!"" And she tried to teach me how to cook. She believed in me all the time. She supported my dreams when my dad would just tell me i'm stupid and that my dreams are idiotic. He always has, and even then, she believed in me. She loves me.
 She's fucking dead.

 and now i have no hope. i will never, ever be loved again by anyone so good, so wonderful as my Mom. I have no one to hold me about it either. But my Mom is so wonderful. She is the best mom in the whole universe and she was the only one who could help me. The only one who knows me. She is the only one who knows, in any part, who i really am. And somehow she loved me. 

And she's dead.

Please don't drink today. You might kill someone's best friend, someone's last hope. Someone at all. And Do you know how bad i want a drink? Do you know how bad i want to pour it all down my throat and kill myself NOW RIGHT NOW so i can see my mom? No matter how bad i feel i will stay sober for Mom. The best Mom in the world would only want me to get sober and try to live.

Please. Please don't drink. If you do, please don't drive. Im begging you. I might die because of thjs. I am begging you like i am begging myself: please don't drink.

4109,2021-08-03 03:10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/owy5ql/after_nearly_4_years_im_stepping_away_from_aa_to/,"After nearly 4 years, I'm stepping away from AA to heal from my childhood","A bit about my drinking and my sobriety: I come from a family of alcoholics and addicts, Dad dead, Uncle on the way, big binge drinker, lots of consequences since my teens. Found AA at 27. Had 3 sponsors, did the steps twice, multiple service commitments (5 meetings a week) and sponsees.

Now at just over 3.5 years sober, I just can't do it anymore. I fundamentally don't agree with the programme, the steps and the brainwashing.

For me, the programme and the steps did nothing to address the deeper issues from my childhood, which for me is the absolute 100% reason I drank. This was probably the single most damaging and invalidating thing I was told - ""there's no rhyme or reason why you're an alcoholic, you just are"". I heard people recount trauma in chairs to then caveat it with ""but that didn't make me an alcoholic"". To me this is the epitome of denial.

Anyway, I found myself having done the steps with everyone then congratulating me and asking me to do chairs to share my story and how awesome redemption felt now that I had ""got recovery"".

I felt good for a short while I think because I had actually followed through with something but in hindsight this was down to a lot of social pressure, perfectionism and people pleasing on my part. As time went on I got into a relationship and sure as hell all of my issues just emerged as raw as ever, all of the things I drank on, all of my abandonment and relational trauma was there.

Like a good AA I took this to my sponsor and was told to ""write inventory looking for my part"", ""pray on it"" and all the rest of it. I'd also call other fellows only to be told that I was being selfish or acting ""like a cunt"" as my fellows liked to say.

My sponsor at the time didn't agree with therapy (that's a whole separate issue) so I ditched him and got a new sponsor and started trying to figure out what the F was wrong with me whilst feeling extremely guilty and like a failure that the 12 steps ""hadn't worked for me"". I know people will reply to this and say ""the book says to get outside help where needed"" but in my experience, the people I was around, this was discouraged.

As I suffered more and more, trying to figure out which part of the programme I wasn't doing correctly, I got to the point where I finally sought proper psychiatric help. I was told by my therapist that I meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder as a result of CPTSD and that I should focus on healing the underlying pain from my childhood.

I cannot tell you the relief I felt after 3.5 years of being told ""you're just an alcoholic"". I felt seen, heard and from that point on I knew my days in AA were done. I began to see how AA was reinforcing a lot of trauma from my childhood. For e.g. I was shamed as a child, and always felt like something was wrong with me. Going to a meeting and saying ""I'm an alcoholic"" (a terminal disease of the mind that basically makes me defective) is totally reinforcing that. Beyond that, the self-blame, the pathological self-reflection, the constant fear of the ""illness doing press ups outside my mind"". I lived in fear as an alcoholic, why should I do that in recovery?

My therapist told me there's nothing wrong with me, it's just how my brain responded to what was happening to me. I want to cry I can't tell you how liberating this feels.

I'm scared about stepping away, but my close friends in AA have been supportive so far. They understand my journey and I already feel so much better having freed up the headspace from all of that guilt and fear.

I have also been going back to my actual real friends who I have long felt isolated from since doing so much AA and I've realised what a wonderful support network I've always had right there in front of me. They've known me for years and love me for who I am, not because of some trauma bond or because we met at a meeting. I've been doing fun stuff again like going to house parties. It feels like I've got my life back.

This is another thing I've realised - recovery is personal. Not some straightjacketed approach. It's fine to go to AA and then to leave even if people tell me I will die. When I need more support in a group setting I will drop into ACOA - I thoroughly recommend for anyone who is trying to heal from a shitty childhood.

Peace and love and to everyone on their journey  x

TLDR: Overall AA helped me a bit, it got me away from drinking because of the community and shared purpose. Having a place to go. But over time it did more harm than good and reinforced childhood trauma (the reasons why I drank).

Edit: thank you so much everyone for your comments and responses. I love SD because it offers such a balanced perspective on recovery. It will definitely be a part of my journey moving forward.",38,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

We¬¥re having a closer look at the [the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/index) this week. So what¬¥s encouraging about that?? Surprisingly or not, the ""be kind"" rule and the ""speak from the I"" rule has allowed for many of us to open up and take the few first steps without being chastised and told what to do. It¬¥s all about creating a safe place.

This goes specifically for today¬¥s little nugget; that we **""do not solicit or offer PMs or outside communication""**. So why on Earth would we try to control basic adult behaviour??

We don¬¥t, we can¬¥t, and we don¬¥t want to. There are however two good reasons for the rule.

For me personally, the open discussions that anyone can participate in, without intruding on a closed group, without needing prior knowledge, lingo or secret nods and handshakes, meant everything. I could be me, and still participate, learn, and grow. Have you ever seen someone say ""I¬¥ve got THE BEST thing EVER! PM me and I¬¥ll tell you""? It sounds fishy, it¬¥s exclusive, and it seriously bugs me.

Secondly, we¬¥ve had several unfortunate instances with conflicts and abuse ranging from well meaning friends to pure creeps and predators preying on people in a vulnerable and situation. The problem for the mods is that we can¬¥t do anything if it doesn¬¥t happen ON THE SUB and is reported. If someone sends you creepy, abusive or threatening messages, take a screenshot to document this (I promise, you¬¥re not the only one), block the person and report it. Even if we can¬¥t do something right away, we¬¥ll have the person on the radar. *Edit to add:* Note that when you block someone, they can still see your posts and comments, but you will not see them. It¬¥s not perfect, but it¬¥s a start.

In short: We want all discussions to be in the open, for the safety of the individual and the benefit of the community. That¬¥s when StopDrinking can really be a vibrant, flourishing haven for us all.

I'm on day 2 of my first real attempt at sobriety. I started drinking very casually at 15, and was drinking every day by 20. I am now 30.

I never really thought I had a problem with drinking because most of the people around me drink way more (both frequency and volume) than I do, even though I was drunk every day. I've never suffered a health consequence from it (if you don't count morbid obesity and insomnia). I can keep myself from drinking during the day (unless I was off work that day). The environment I've been in since I was a kid tricked me into believing I had control.

I can't just have one. I can't just drink one day in a row. I can't hang out with friends without drinking, I can't go to sleep without drinking, I can't get off work without drinking (I work in a restaurant that offers free alcohol at the end of my shift and everyone hangs out after work to drink and talk). I've done the whole ""I'll just stop drinking on weeknights"", or ""no more than 2 drinks a day!"" for 10 years now.  I'm so tired of this life. 

So a month ago I set my sober date at August 1. It's now been 2 days and I'm feeling ok. I'm slowly figuring out that boredom is gonna be my main trigger. I've been off work these 2 days and so far have watched 8 hours of Grey's Anatomy, and played 8 hours of Red Dead Redemption. I'm having trouble sleeping, but I'm being easy on myself for the first couple days to adjust, get through work and immediately leave instead of hanging around and chatting, and keeping myself as busy as I can.

If you read this, thanks for listening. I look forward to the support and guidance I'm finding in the posts, as well as advice on what people have found to beat the boredom.

Crying wasn‚Äôt about sadness it was a punishment I gave myself for ‚Äònot being good enough‚Äô.As I got older and alcohol entered the picture I‚Äôd drink to feel better, then I‚Äôd hit the third drink mark and I‚Äôd start to drink to feel worse. Then I‚Äôd drink to punish myself for drinking and the spend the next day feeling the ravages of the night before. Id feel like I deserved the hangover, the guilt and the general pains because I wasn‚Äôt good enough to just be myself. This realization for me was a big help, I hope it resonates with someone who needs to hear it. Don‚Äôt punish yourself.",13,0

It‚Äôs such a habit. The war inside my head. When the cravings come I think of (and have written down) reasons not to do it; that‚Äôs a negative phrasing I don‚Äôt like much though, so I‚Äôve also included things like ‚Äúthe morning will feel freeee‚Äù and the like. I‚Äôve also changed my iPhone wallpaper to reflect freedom, and my PC wallpaper to ‚ÄúI chose sober because I wanted a better life. I stay sober because I‚Äôve got one.‚Äù Things to aspire to and work on.

And then yesterday I looked at the new wallpaper and stood up and went to the store. 

I deliberately shut off my brain so I can drink. I know it‚Äôs hurting me even before I buy the wine, but I do it anyway. A very deep entrenched habit, such that when I use the energy from the war inside my head for cleaning or something else, the brain is hounding me to go to the store. 

I need to sit with the thoughts and allow them, and decide they don‚Äôt serve me. But the habit thoughts are very persistent and loud. 

I think of myself in a more positive way through practice even if I do drink; it‚Äôs at the point where it‚Äôs foreign *not* to practice thinking joyous or beauty thoughts. 

I know I need to do this one day at a time and focus on that day, or hour, etc. I‚Äôve seen that the mindfulness practice has taken hold. Maybe I can think of things just for that night/hour, and if I can get the dreaded 2nd or 3rd day under my belt (I‚Äôm 21 hours‚Äô sober) more and more often, this too will one day take hold. 

It is such a hard fight and I often spend my hangover days crying.

After shit-talking my former drunk self for just staying indoors all summer reading in the past, I find I am doing it sober too. Unemployed, not much money, car having issues, and poor air quality outside from all the forest fire smoke have me home all the time. I read 9 books in July. 9.5 really since I got halfway through the biography of Alexander the Great I'm still reading. Well at least this summer I'll have some memory of the books! 

So Alexander was a ""thegreat"" like myself, lol.  My stupid username was actually meant as a less self-body-shaming way of saying I needed to lose some weight. Had no idea this account would be the one that stuck as my main or I'd have picked something way cooler. But Alexander, wow, this guy . . . Greatness to spare but not a nice guy by modern standards. He'd surely be canceled if he were a 21st century celebrity. But he certainly was bold. Lots of confidence. Also, I'm noticing, not much of a drinker. I read Julius Caesar's biography a few years ago and he was not a big drinker either. And it's not that there weren't heavy drinkers in the ancient world. There were plenty including Alexander's father, Philip. So it's not our usual type of sober lesson, but here's one takeaway: if you want to crush your enemies and dominate the known world, you'd do better by staying sober.

Three days later, after pedialyte, fluids vitamins and no drinking whatsoever, I am exhausted. I've never slept so hard in my life. I'll stir in my sleep and feel so weak.

I am a ""functional"" alcoholic of the typical self-deceiving sort: neither my career, relationships, nor bank account was jeopardized from my drinking, only my mental and physical health. I never drank in the morning or during the day. I tried to establish rules that are probably also familiar to many of us: no drinking before such and such a time, only X number of drinks per night, no weekday drinking, blah blah blah. Sometimes I abided by these rules, and they worked for respectable stretches of time, and I could at least lie to myself and say I wasn't really an alcoholic if I could quit by sticking to strict rules. Non-alcoholics don't *need* such rules, but that never even occurred to me. 

None those reasons are why I need to quit drinking this time. This time it's different. This time it's flowing from a wound that perhaps only the aging soul is dealt. This time I miss how I felt as a kid, and if there is any hope of regaining even a glimpse of who I used to be, I must get my drinking under control.

I miss sleeping in, sleeping deeply, and sleeping the entire night, waking up and stretching in sunshine bright and clear as my mind was. I miss drinking a glass of milk with a wholesome dinner instead of a cocktail. Last November, my wife and I moved to a neighborhood that reminds me so, so much of the one I grew up in, and I miss spending evenings sitting outdoors just enjoying its sounds and sights without a dizzy veil shadowing my mind. I miss that feeling when I was a kid watching SNICK (Saturday Night Nickelodeon for the younger crowd here) or Star Trek or playing Final Fantasy, curled up in my pajamas, the blue glow of the television captivating my attention instead of an alcoholic fog... That unencumbered, unimpaired feeling of innocence and clarity and presence of mind. *That* is what I miss. 

The drunken mind can be tricked into believing it has regained these feelings of youth, but it is a poisoned facsimile. And perhaps I'm being rather sentimental, but that's the whole point. I'm a sentimental guy. Maybe I can never be him again, not truly, but if there is a chance at all, I know what I need to do.

So here I am. It just crossed past eight o'clock, the normal time I'd allow myself two (only two!) cocktails on a weeknight before going to bed. But not tonight.

So I have recently quit drinking alcohol and I have been loving sober life so much. My friends have been supportive which has been a relief. However i'm going back to university next month and I'm afraid of relapsing due to peer/social pressure. 

I have been considering signing up to a physical group/meetings so that I can create relationships with other sober people in person and have joint sober experiences rather than solely alone. Being almost 20 years old and going sober can feel quite lonely sometimes so having even just one sober friend would be so amazing.

My question is, have you been to physical support groups? Is there anything I should know going into it? Are online meetings worth trying?

Drinking to cope with it only made me an angry drunk. Now that I'm over a year sober I'm constantly having these desperate moments where I kind of just want to run away from it all. I'm working just to pay rent and buy shit I don't need. I'm not living my life to its true potential. I'm feeling exhausted every day. From what I understand, in AA, in times like this I'm suppose to give it all up to my HP/G. But as much as I try, it's like talking to myself in my own head. Eventually that feeling passes, usually when I stuff my face with something that isn't good for me. But now I'm wondering if there are others who experience that feeling of pointlessness even in sobriety?

Handling the 20 questions - I always just say it like it is. Why call a soda water ""vodka soda,"" or any other alibi? This isn't about confidence, but logic. I roll two ways: 

(a) If it's someone I don't care about, I say ""I'm an alcoholic."" - ""Naw, c'mon you're not that bad."" - ""No I talked to my doc, I'm a verified alcoholic."" It's a question-stopper. I've never heard them spread rumors, and they don't follow up with judgement. Actually, it's fun: rather than looking judgey, they kinda zone out. These people know I drank no more than they do. Now they have a point of reference for self reflection. Everyone else keeps talking and they're looking at their lap. Yes... ruminate...

(b) If it's someone I care about, I just gush about the benefits. ""I get so much more done, better sleep, I've lost x pounds, check out my skin!"" It gets them reflecting on their sober days and agreeing. Seeding positive change.

Neither of these approaches reflects judgement back (unless they decide to take it that way). Neither deflect the question, nor set myself up for maintaining the lie.

Further, I've noticed that the sober bar-flies (tread lightly, ye sobering up) hold an air of power. Same with a non-smoker hanging with the smokers. There's one sober fly I'm thinking of in particular. The way people act towards him betrays deference. Rarely they'll scoff about his sobriety (IMO because he used obvious excuses, rather than A or B) - but the language they use betrays insecurity. This guy was sober before I even wanted to be, and I caught on early (ie, I'm not creating evidence). Something out of a Robert Greene book - it fascinated me. ""Wow - these nervous flies are treating him like a silverback - what gives?"" Over time, it made sense. He's showing immense discipline and power in the face of danger. I'm serious: women flock to this guy, he's not a looker. After observing him a year, it's become clear that black-sheeping a bar like that has the opposite effect we sober-curious think it would. It shows power.

If you detect discomfort with admission, it's not judgement - it's insecurity. In other words, the judgement dynamic is the inverse of what we've been thinking. I don't want anyone to feel judged, just that knowing this helps tick that checkbox of ""why I'll have just one.""",8,0

1. Although I was by my definition a  ""casual"" drinker, I was clearly drinking more than my body agreed with. I'd say I'd have a drink or two, two to three times per week. It was too much.
2. I thought about drinking in response to stress more than I would have believed I did before having a dry month on purpose.
3. My (over)weight is far more tied to alcohol than I thought. I absolutely believed in ""skinny"" drinks. It's a bullshit lie. I lost more weight in a month than I did in a year with a personal trainer, even though I did not consciously change any other habits.
4. I have been able to see my family dynamics in a truer light. Even though my older kids have always been cared for, that two to three nights per week of having my light dulled stole something from all of us. 
5. I have been able to see that my effectiveness in taking care of household projects has been shit thanks to alcohol. Want to fix a hand railing? Nah, have a glass of wine instead. I've done a year or more in projects in a month. It feels shameful to see what petty, minor things I just let go. 

There is more. More meta stuff like recognizing how abusive I am to myself. How I haven't cared enough about me to be present for myself. It's been a bandaid for a garden variety of problems and I've had enough.

So here I go again, screwing up my life. I have had a very toxic relationship with alcohol for many, many years. I have been an active drinker for over 20 years.   I used to  not drink at all - occasionally during teenage and 20s-just weekend, party, experimental times. , then started the occasional drinking, then as a coping mechanism during my 30s and 40s. Last 5 years, it got real. It got to be a huge problem. I mean daily drinking, from moment I woke up until I went to bed. I did some real stupid things. Things you read about and think that only happens to others, I am in control, I can function. But reality is, I did it. I have done so, so many things to be ashamed of. Drinking first thing in am, drinking all day, drinking and driving, drinking during kids school events, drinking just to drink.

I have no excuses, I have no reasons. I have a great life. I have a wonderfully supportive family, extended family and groups of friends that are more willing to help. Many of them have offered, many have reached out. I have had great conversations, used many coping techniques, but then bam! It just hits me and I relapse. Time after time. Struggle to overcome, struggling to be strong. But Im not, Im weak, Im human and Im struggling.  I can list reasons, I can list causes but they are all just a very long list of excuses!! I am hoping to overcome. I can go for a while without a drink, days, weeks even months but havent made it to years yet.

But reality is, I have a problem, I have a very big problem. Its not just alcohol. It my demeaner, its the way I handle things, how I process things. Dont want a label, dont want any more excuses. I just want to be a better person. How I feel inside, it not what I portray to the outside world. I can be strong, I can be supportive, I can be needy, I can be weak. But struggle to see who I really am. I have been married for over 28 years to the one and only friend I truly have in this world. He is absolutely everything to me. But instead of embracing what I have, I always manage to screw up. Not just drinking, but lying, and not being open about my feelings. I avoid confrontation at all costs. Big items, small items just dont want to cause commotion. But fail to see that I am doing more harm by hiding and avoiding. Our kids have grown up to be very strong, great people. I know I did some things right because of the way they have turned out. The love is there for me, but I am destroying relationships.   I have been in rehab, I have done counseling, I live in constant regret and shame of all I have done. I need to find a way to forgive myself, quit with excuses and trying for find an easy way out,   find a way to make amends for what I have done and somehow find a way to be happy and embrace the person I am.

Usually it's an after work need to dull the irritation of customer service work, but on days like today, when I'm relaxing in the sun on a day off, I get that late-afternoon craving for a beer that is really hard to ignore. My question to you fellow beer-drinkers: What beverage or food help you curb the craving? Here are a few that have worked for me in the past, but I'm always open to suggestions:

- dark chocolate
- ginger kombucha
- black tea brewed really bitter to try and get that ipa level of kick

Conversely, some foods make the craving worse. Like, a slice of pizza or a barbecued burger will make me crave a beer to go with it. I'd like to hear your thoughts and suggestions.",12,0

So I strung together 3 days of not drinking probably since 2017 last week. It was hard, and my morning and evening drinks were calling my name, but I resisted. It was a friend‚Äôs birthday this weekend and we went out to a restaurant and then to a bar. I didn‚Äôt make any bad choices. I ubered home and went right to bed, and I was with a close friend, so I don‚Äôt have any social embarrassment or shame, which was really nice. Saturday I went out to a bar with my sister and some friends. I don‚Äôt remember the uber ride home or going to bed, but all of my toiletries were out in the bathroom so my black out auto pilot at least washed my face, brushed my teeth, and took my medicine. Sunday I had a beer with breakfast, but drank nothing else for the rest of the day. I could have a whole sober August if I didn‚Äôt do that, ugh. Resetting the counter on my ‚ÄúI Am Sober‚Äù app was really disappointing to me. So now I‚Äôm on day 1 again. I‚Äôm feeling good about this week!!

Friday and Saturday worry me though.... I have a date with my husband planned on Friday, and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be drinking, and honestly probably disappointed if I don‚Äôt drink with him. We enable each other pretty hard and drink a large amount together very often. And I am going to my dads house for a pool party on Saturday where the drinks will be flowing and my sister will be there. She and I enable each other pretty hard too. Every time we hang out we make it a party. I‚Äôm not ready to admit to my family that I am not drinking, and I need to examine why.

I feel like I‚Äôm setting myself up for failure every weekend. Maybe it‚Äôs semi intentional, that I‚Äôm sabotaging myself. I don‚Äôt really know how to do anything sober, and I haven‚Äôt really done anything sober for probably 12 years. Scary stuff, man.  Uncharted waters.

TLDR: Relapsed after 3 days and am disappointed. Worried about weekends in general, but specifically this weekend.",6,0

Break is the wrong word, I suppose. Do I envision a life not having a drop of alcohol.  
It seems hard to see now, I don't think it ever took over my life but it sure as hell did lead me to do some really stupid ass stuff. Stuff I am not proud of.

Not sure what definition one would apply to me.   
4pm is around the time I slip into that old habit.  
Kick the feet up on the recliner, keep filling up the OJ/Vodka and ice glass.  
End with a few Mike's. Drink a bunch of water.

I'm still not understanding how I woke up at 1:11 a.m. on the 25th, jumped out of bed and poured all my alcohol down the drain. It was as if I wasn't really in control of myself. I just did it. 

Weird, odd. No alcohol tonight. Perhaps some youtube, perhaps some reading, perhaps some gaming on the phone and then later, cooking a nice salmon dinner with my partner. I definitely do appreciate eating healthier though the refrigerator calls now, something to ignore.

I had absolutely zero fun, and the most surprising part is that I have no urge to drink again today!

I feel a lot better in many ways, but my body feels like complete garbage still. 

I was feeling a lot of my energy return but I'm now on furosemide and spironolactone to continue reducing my ascites, losing about a lb a day and its noticeably shrinking, but I have to wake up every 2 hours to pee and that just leaves me exhausted. On top of that I get insane muscle cramps in my legs and feet at night now too.

My diet is awesome, very healthy, it's probably the only thing giving me energy right now, but I'll admit eating a low sodium diet is a bit tough and a bit bland too. 

I never really realized until recently just how much muscle mass I've lost in the past 6 months or so, it's kind of scary, I almost look like some of the heroin addicts I knew in passing. I'm making sure I'm eating a lot of lean protein, lots of green veggies to up my vitamin K and hopefully lower my INR, but I don't yet have the energy for light exercise or weight training yet. 

2 weeks and still waiting for the GI/Hep dr to call me from my referral for an appointment. I still have no official diagnosis other than inflamed liver and spleen. I'm pretty sure I have cirrhosis though what with the ascites, and the fact my blood pressure is normal but heart rate is through the roof leads me to believe I have portal hypertension. What's odd too is I can feel my pulse in my throat, not the carotid arteries either. Never got jaundice though, which I found weird considering my bilirubin is/was 3.25 (that was measured about a month 1/2 after quitting, I can only wonder what it was on day 1).

Well I guess I'm just going to have to wait longer to see a specialist.

That's exactly why I'm back to AA. I tried everything this past year...switching to beer over vodka, taking red bull out, starting later in the day. I've had every excuse and plan in the book, to let myself keep drinking, and denying the problem. It's cost me almost every relationship I have ever been in, including my marriage. I've sent texts I have regretted thousands of times, I've messaged married women on Facebook at 4:00 in the morning on a weeknight, and not remembered it at all. I would delete messages in the morning, to make them go away, like I hadn't even done it. I've woke up under trees outside of bars, rode home with random people from gas stations when I'd walk there to find a ride home. I've lied to myself for 20 years that I can be a social drinker. The fact is I cannot do it. I don't even desire to have a few drinks. I desire to drink until I can't talk, and I drink fast. Sometimes I'll have 4 drinks to my friends one. I've decided this week I am done with that lifestyle. I hate myself for it. You need to do this for yourself, and nobody else. If my story is yours, we can do this.

I don't even know how to talk about it or how to explain it but I'll try, just on case someone's been here, felt this way, and things eventually worked out. 

Basically alcohol and my decisions have taken away from me a good part of my mid 20's. Lost a job, had to move back in with my parents. I've been here now for roughly six months, still doing the same thing. Talked with my parents about my issues and they've been super patient. I'm scared for my future because at my age, I shouldn't be here. I find myself being terrified to move out. I don't think I ever really learned how to truly be independent. I'm terrified that if I move out, I'll lose my job somehow again, and just lose everything. My car, everything I've worked for. I blame covid, and surely there's some validity to that, but ultimately the drinking is eating into my savings, melting my head, and making me the lazy unproductive slob I've become. 

Before I drank I was the type that was ""always trying to stay busy."" Whether it was a personal project, going out with some friends, or working in some way. I held a full time job and was a full time college student making really great grades and what not. I know I'm not a lazy person, drinking has made me one. 

I'm in a place mentally where I'm so ashamed of myself honestly, I just don't wanna think about it. I don't even like talking to other people now cause mind is racing worrying they think I'm a loser. A lot of it is probably projection, cause that's what I think about myself, but I just hate this. I feel trapped because the only time I can enjoy myself is when I'm drunk, which is the issue in itself, but I'd I don't drink I start realizing how far in life I've put myself back, and how bad it is. I can either face everything, or drink myself to sleep. I'm fine with facing things, I want to, I just don't get why I'm not doing it. I don't understand the choices I make and why anymore. 

I probably did a horrendous job explaining things, and I'm aware the tough answer is eventually I'm going to have to find a way to overcome this fear of everything. I don't know how, I'm always either confused, tired, or angry. I don't know, I'm just confused and embarrassed for myself.",4,1

FYI, I‚Äôm in my early 50s. On my birthday, about  two weeks after I started, I had friends who flew in to visit and it was very festive, and I knew I‚Äôd continue not drinking but just wanted to celebrate. I probably had half a bottle of Champagne and a glass of red wine. I woke up feeling it and thinking ‚ÄúYuck, this is why I don‚Äôt drink.‚Äù I knew I‚Äôd feel that way and I knew I‚Äôd resume not drinking. Fast-forward another 30-ish days to this past weekend. Throughout, I‚Äôve been craving white wine (not my usual drink of choice, which I weird). There‚Äôve been maybe three times out at a restaurant on a deck at cocktail hour before dinner and I thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôd give my right arm for a single glass of chilled sauve blanc.‚Äù Resisted each time.

Sat. evening, out with another couple for a relaxed evening, I got that I JUST WANT A SINGLE GLASS OF WHITE WINE feeling. IT‚ÄôS BEEN 40 DAYS. I told the table I was ordering a single glass, that was it, but I needed to scratch that itch. Friends (the wife is sober)/husband were a little surprised but mostly shrugged. Glass came. Tasted really nice, I enjoyed it, nursed throughout dinner. Satisfying. Went home, went to bed, and I‚Äôve resumed not drinking. In my drinking days, I would have had two glasses, then gone home and opened a bottle of red and had half a bottle before bed. I had zero desire to do that.

I am not any less resolved to not be a daily, even weekly drinker anymore (I was a daily almost-bottle or bottle of wine drinker). Something has shifted so that I think ‚Äúgross‚Äù when I look back on that. It was not serving me (or my liver) well.

I understand moderation doesn‚Äôt work, and I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre all going to tell me that. I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù by having a daily glass or two and telling myself I‚Äôll just cut down. But dammit if I don‚Äôt want the freedom and judgment to sip a glass of white wine while watching the sun set with friends on a deck (a situation that doesn‚Äôt happen that often).

These 43 days have been tough at times, not so tough at others. I feel proud of myself. I feel like I‚Äôve earned each of these days (minus two). I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to reset to day 1 after the glass of wine. I know I won‚Äôt drink tonight or tomorrow or the day after.

But at a wedding in seven weeks if I want to sip a glass of champagne, and then continue my AF streak, am I just a fraud? I don‚Äôt feel like the glass of white set off a cascading effect, I want to drink no more or less than before I had it, and it was immensely satisfying. It wasn‚Äôt a struggle not to order a second one.

I'll spare y'all the long version, but I recently had a conversation with a business acquaintance who I've found out, has been sober for 2 years. She never went to a meeting, never heard of this sub. (of course I told her!).  We've had a business relationship for several years and I was quite taken back when she so openly shared this with me.

She made several poignant statements about the difficulty of moderation. About how it's a LOT more work than just stopping. It was a wonderful, surprise conversation that I didn't expect to have but so glad I did.  And it was a relief, because while she was in town, I had to take her to dinner. She got unsweetened tea (yuck), I got sweet tea. It was my first sober business dinner EVER. It felt great and empowering.

Here's the thing: I feel like shit. And have almost this entire time.

You read all these stories of people who have a week and all the sudden they're running marathons and meal prepping and getting the best sleep of their lives. Well that's not me.

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I made the choice I did. I've lost weight, my skin is glowing, and best of all I don't ever wake up in a cold sweat at 3 in the morning with the driest of dry mouths nervously reaching for my phone to find out who I went off on. OK, all good.

But there's a downside that people don't talk about perhaps as much as they should, one that makes you feel a twinge of jealousy toward those who appear to be able to flip a switch and go forward into their fabulous new life. There's 25 years of shit I've been drinking to forget bubbling under the surface like a morning fart after a long night of drinking. I sleep like shit. My brain is a prison some days. The anxiety *physically* hurts sometimes, I'm in constant fight or flight for absolutely no reason whatsoever. And it's hard. But I'm working through it, I'm journaling and getting my exercise and taking my meds and putting in work in therapy. My house is spotless and my cats want to hang out with me again. So it's *better*, it's just hard to accept that there's still a long road ahead.

It didn't take 300 days for me to get where I was in October when I made the decision to give it up for good. And I know it was unreasonable to think it would take less than that to feel ""normal"" or happy or whatever it is that I think I should feel at this point. I guess it's just disappointing to accept that, and to acknowledge that I dug such a deep hole for myself that I now have to keep digging my way out of. Maybe I'll never get out. But at least I'm trying.

Im currently 1 yr 320 days sober (not continuously but I prefer to count it all together to not discredit that first important year) current streak is 320 days.. anyways 

The important thing is that I made it through a big family vacation and wedding without one sip of champagne. [This is in a country where events are allowed btw and we were all double vaxxed.]

Was it easy ? Not always ! Especially in the hours leading up to a huge wedding, or at the wedding reception, or when seeing an uncle for the first time who I always used to drink with, or when my cousins were bonding over ros√© on the beach. No, it‚Äôs not always easy. It can be super lonely and awkward.

But there were a lot of wins too! my takeaways are 

- if ur sober on an otherwise boozy vacay, get up early and hit the treadmill / see some sites! celebrate your new lifestyle by behaving in a different way. I came home and recovered so quick from the vacay, and went straight back into my exercise routine and felt amazing for it. 
- you do not need 4 champagnes to dance your butt off at a wedding. Im a better dancer without the booze! And i felt some pity for those who needed to be wasted to dance. I am grateful I can do that without alcohol - dancing is so integral to human connection and expression. Alcohol hijacked it! I‚Äôm taking it back. 
- Waking up after a major party with no regrets, blackouts or hangover truly never gets old. It feels amazing and is worth the work. 
- Some people may not accept you for your decision to stop drinking or worse, pity you. It‚Äôs ok, you can‚Äôt control others. the strength it takes to be yourself against adversity builds a stable and strong character. Enjoy the growth. 
- After almost 2 years not drinking I feel I may finally be undoing the brainwashing! I used to envy ppl drinking wine or champagne. Now I genuinely remember how it tastes and feels, and 90% of the time, I don‚Äôt want it. 
- Drinking water on a hot beach is an infinitely smarter choice than having something dehydrating 
- I‚Äôm funnier without the alcohol. I frequently found myself the center of attention cracking jokes and it‚Äôs because I have more confidence and sharper mind now. 

My main takeaway is that it‚Äôs still not easy, I sometimes felt embarrassed or left out. But those moments pass and the positives totally outweighs the negatives.

I can honestly say it was one of the best weeks of my life and At moments I felt pure bliss! I came home with my head held high and better relationships with others (and myself).",12,0

Fast forward til now, all my friends are married or getting married, but the partying still seems the same.

I still don't really like that word. But goodness gracious, did I need to say it. 

Do you need to say it? Do you need to take a break? Are you lurking? Do you (wrongly, IMO) beat yourself up over trying to stop and not ""making it"", even though it's ""progress"" like I did a number of times?

These people are some that I drink with and some that I do not. I do not crave alcohol and when I am by myself I do not drink it at all. During the pandemic quarentine, I went months without it. However lately when nights out come around, the next day my body does not handle it well and I become a very anxious person for a day or two. 

I am 34 now and the recovery after is a lot mentally and physically. I can think of a few times where alcohol has been a hinderance on my life and relationships. The night's out I love when I drink. I have been successful with moderation (when driving or need to go home) but other nights where I overdo it completely. I had a night in May in which my behavior during and after drinking was very embarassing. A few people texted me the following day to check on me. I am a reserved person in general so alcohol over the years has led to more ""success"" with the opposite sex, at least in my mind.  It was one of those Friday and Saturday moments where I told myself no more and meant it. 

Fast forward to this past Friday and a co-worker had a get together at the bar to celebrate her new job out of state. I drank with old friends and a few new ones. Overall the night was very positive. However I do not remember getting home and ending the night at the bar. I did have a pre-determined ride planned already from a work friend. I was saddened that I had forgot many of the conversations towards the end of the night as I assumed I had one with my friend who is now leaving permanently. 

I recently had an old girfriend get engaged which has been on my mind. I can point to that as a reason that I drank extensively or my justification. Saturday I woke up very hungover and not myself. I tend to have a morning routine that is very energetic, and I could not participate in that. Saturday I did not get out of bed until the afternoon and then could barely eat or do much. Sunday comes around and I still felt terrible and with no energy. I even feel a little guilty posting here because I do not think I have it ""as bad"" as some others. I just know that alcohol has messed up my flow in my day to day life and created missed connections on these evenings that I cannot get back. It creates anxiety within me afterwards that I feel like I cannot shake. 

I did not know where to express how I was feeling so I thought I would come here. I have read this board before and enjoyed the positive nature of many posters. I have no urge to drink and typically do not drink after hangover weekends at all for a few weeks. I would prefer to never go through this feeling again. How can I remind myself of this in a few weeks or months? 

I have asked the question to myself and others. Do I have a drinking problem or are these isolated incidents? All I know is that I do not not want these nights anymore where I wake up wondering what had happened and then unable to function creating a miserable weekend. I will say that I have a happy hour group that meets every few weeks, and I can have a social drink or none at all with relative ease. I wish to cut down on these ""main event"" drinking nights, if that makes any sense.",3,1

My mother was a severe alcoholic in denial and died from liver failure early last year. Considering my familial background I always knew I was predisposed to have issues with alcohol, but I was young and depressed when I started and it comforted me when nothing else could so I didn't care. 6 years later and I still struggle constantly with drinking, but it was always at least a bit of an effort to get my hands on it considering I wasn't of legal age. Now I'm 21 and have to deal with the fact I can get a drink pretty much any time I wish. I thought I could handle it at first but it only took two weeks after my birthday to notice my control was totally slipping so I've since ditched it completely, about 1 month dry so far. I can't help but feel like I've been robbed of this fun part of my life and resent myself for my inability to control myself and go to bars and clubs with my friends like every other dumb college student.

I have been browsing this board all day (I‚Äôm not very familiar with Reddit not sure if that‚Äôs the right term, lol) and wow it‚Äôs been helping a lot. Yesterday I promised myself I would have only one drink in the middle of the day but you know how that goes. I ended up at the back of an AA meeting crying and left halfway through and called a rehab center for outpatient. I can go a few days without drinking but haven‚Äôt gone longer than a week in 15 years. The blackouts and severe binge drinking have happened consistently that entire time. I think the one of the hardest things for me is just keeping that mindset of commitment,there are some days I don‚Äôt need a drink but when I do feel that trigger eventually I am not in the headspace at the time where I feel I need to stop drinking, I just forget. How do you keep that dedication constantly on your mind without faltering?

For me I am lucky enough to not have faced any severe consequences (lately) but what really opened my eyes to my rock bottom was just the rapid decline of my mental and physical health lately. Memory is complete shit, sleep is awful, relationships nonexistent, hangovers worse than ever where I feel like I‚Äôm dying sometimes. I‚Äôve also lost almost every one of my friends in the area I live, I just have one left. I dont know a direct reason as to why but it‚Äôs pretty obvious it‚Äôs cuz I‚Äôm a drunk. I feel the need to drink in any social situation so have started avoiding them entirely. But when I do that I just get drunk at home instead because I feel so lonely. God I feel pathetic typing that. But keeping it anyway in hopes this will help someone else too. I know things will change once I stop wallowing in self hatred, get therapy and meet like minded people. 

I feel different today than I did in the 100s of times I‚Äôve wanted to quit before. I can see how all the benefits of sobriety are worth it.

I've actually been sleeping well for about a week, which has been awesome. But occasionally thoughts will float up of some of the things I went through in the past few months. I went through two binge periods in about two months that were like nightmares. The first one, I remember drinking heavily for about a week because I was having a rough week at work. Of course, as we all know happens my anxiety therefore spiked and one night I was slamming beers just to try to get the tight feeling of panic in my chest to go away. It wasn't working, and I remember feeling so frustrated. Then I heard my husband coming home, and felt the shame of knowing he would see the empty cans around me and got up to go up the stairs to bed. It was only when I stood up that I realized I was actually incredibly drunk. I hadn't eaten anything, and the alcohol hit me hard. I slipped on the carpeted stairs, and fell down a few steps landing on my side and rear somehow miraculously missing the banister with my head and neck. My husband found me on the floor and rightfully refused to let me up the stairs that night- he set up a cot for me downstairs and I slept it off. Cue a week that was a total blur of drinking, not even processing the fact that I could have easily died that night because I was still blind with the urge to drink.

I managed to stay sober for a bit after that but relapsed again shortly thereafter, and writing out all of the details of that two week period is still too painful. Suffice it to say that after that binge I knew I had to get sober or I was going to die, point blank, and I made the VERY STUPID decision to detox at home. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS, IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DETOX FROM ALCOHOL IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE SAFEST THING TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP. It was the worst 3 days of my life- I threw up bile on and off for a day but somehow mostly kept down gatorade and broth, and for three days was so weak the most I could do was sleep and watch tv on my laptop. I was constantly sweating, and when I turned the fan to blow on me I heard voices speaking/singing to me. I saw things out of the corners of my eyes that weren't there, heard noises in the house that weren't real. I had such trouble focusing on things and doing the most basic tasks. I was so scared, and I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. But I was so determined to get and stay sober; I just wanted to purge the poison from my body and start to heal. I can honestly say I have no desire to drink today, or ever again, and I'm grateful every day just to be here. I'm seeing a psychiatrist for addiction, and am also in an IOP drug & alcohol program.

I pieced the story together from what I could understand. Long story short someone had too much to drink made a fool of themselves and are embarrassed. 

Fast forward to this morning woke up at 9 am had 8 unread texts from said person saying they were sorry for calling me so late and that they are embarrassed you know how it goes. 

This is all before I had my breakfast. So I get logged into work and start working and I had a day today where it wasn‚Äôt super busy so my mind started to wander. Which is dangerous because it‚Äôs too small to be out on its own for an extended period. 

It‚Äôs been over a year. I no longer call and text my friends misspelled nonsense at 3 am. The room when I lay down doesn‚Äôt spin and i no longer wake up smelling like a stale cigarette. It‚Äôs been incredible. 

This year since I stopped drinking my life has changed drastically I used to have moments like these weekly. The only times I have not been 100 percent sober this year were when I had my tooth pulled from the painkillers and I have ate a couple edibles for pain when my knee injuries flared up. It still amazes me how much of your life falls into place on its own when you just have a clear head. 

I told my friend today that it was no big deal and I‚Äôm glad all that happened was she got in the wrong Lyft and went to the wrong bar. It could have been worse. I had a huge sigh of relief for myself when I realized today that I no longer have those nights. IWNDWYT",70,0

It's time for yet another round of kindness in this week's AoK! This message is proudly brought to you by the kind /u/Piggoos and sponsored by yours truly lol :) I used to be like [this](https://youtu.be/VPtu5V3kHTM) until I found AoK but now I know that [Come Monday, It'll be alright!](https://youtu.be/qnKKlf_FGwg)

&#x200B;

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game. 

&#x200B;

I heard this story for the first time this week, but apparently it dates back to 2012 and as with most things with social media, it has grown and evolved beyond its roots. Two runners, one from Spain and one from Kenya, were running a race. The Kenyan was in the lead and few metres from the finish line. The Spanish runner was a few metres behind him, when the Kenyan runner got confused by the signage and stopped to try to figure out what he was looking at. The Spanish runner saw what was happening and started shouting at him to try to get him to start running again. The Kenyan runner didn‚Äôt speak Spanish so he didn‚Äôt understand what the Spanish runner was saying, so the Spanish runner starting pushing the Kenyan until he crossed the finish line and won the race. The story moved me to tears. It‚Äôs truth has gotten murky over the years and the details and the Spanish runner‚Äôs intentions are somewhat disputed, but regardless of his motivations, he literally pushed his opponent across the finish line. The Spanish runner could have taken full advantage of the Kenyan‚Äôs confusion to win the race but he didn‚Äôt; he pushed the runner to the finish line so his competitor won. I loved this story. That kind of selfless action is something I aspire towards. I don‚Äôt want to win or succeed at life because I took advantage of someone else‚Äôs moments of weakness. I‚Äôd rather succeed on the merit of my own skill and effort. And I think that is the truth of success in quitting drinking. So many of us try to run our own race, but based on what I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs the support of people behind us who see us falter and are willing to help push us on that get us to the finish line. While sobriety means different things to different people, many of us rely on other people to help get us there. 

Here is the internet version of the runners' story if you want to read it: [https://www.inspiremore.com/ivan-fernandez-anaya-abel-mutai/](https://www.inspiremore.com/ivan-fernandez-anaya-abel-mutai/)

I got counseling, sold off assets, scaled down my business, am exercising daily and connecting with good friends. 

But I'm still drinking. For ages as I was going through the process of recovery and change I told myself the alcohol was still the way to get through each sleepless, stressful night. But I'm not anxious and lonely anymore. In fact, I feel proud of how far I've come and optimistic for the first time in a long time. 

So I can't fool myself anymore. Alcohol isn't a ""necessary evil"" in my life, it's just a problem I need to face and deal with.

I'm looking forward to not feeling guilty every morning. I'm looking forward to spending all that money I used to waste on booze on something worthwhile.

This is my first Reddit post but I have been a lurker of various drinking subs for quite a while now. I‚Äôm 21m and in the process of wrapping up my degree. Over the past year and a half or so my drinking has increased to a point that is near debilitating. While I wouldn‚Äôt say I was an everyday drinker, I began going on binges that lasted longer and longer and were becoming more frequent. I was hospitalized in December after a particularly heavy bender and my numbers were through the roof. That didn‚Äôt  stop me from working my way into a bender every month or so since. The withdrawals have already gotten to the point where I‚Äôm completely incapable of doing anything for days, puking bile from morning to night, the shaking, the sweating, the sounds that aren‚Äôt there, you guys know the deal. Over this period of time I have been destroying my family and isolating myself from my friends. During the last few benders I got scarily comfortable with driving drunk, and came very unreliable at my job to the point I can‚Äôt believe I wasn‚Äôt fired. I‚Äôve never gotten in trouble with a DUI and outside of upsetting parents and friends, I haven‚Äôt had any ‚Äúreal trouble because of my drinking‚Äù. And it scares the shit out of me because I know that I am sooooooo close to life-changing trouble that I can almost smell it. 

So anyways, after another hefty bender through last week and the weekend, another week of fighting with my parents and failing on commitments, I finally told my parents that I know I have a drinking problem and I want to go to rehab. This has been a traumatizing experience admitting things that I‚Äôve tried to keep hidden from the word more than anything else,  but the relief that getting sober will allow me to be a good, honest person, and an amazing son to my family makes me so excited to just dive in and accept what rehab can give me. 

I know I‚Äôll never forget the look on my dads face, sitting next to my hospital bed with tears in his eyes, in disbelief that he was seeing his oldest son in that state, but I‚Äôm ready for his face to have a big smile on it whenever were together from this point forward.

Its been about 2 years since we were away from each other overnight. Last time, we had been dating for about a year. He had gone to a gaming convention with his best bud for the weekend in the next city over (I had gone with them the year before but got too drunk and kicked out. I was too embarrassed to return). I had a few drinks after getting off work, went home and continued drinking. I ended up getting black out drunk, picking a fight with him, and ultimately ruining the weekend. Ya see, when I got blackout drunk it was like I fell into the deepest pit of depression and there were several times that I self-harmed. I was acting this way, while home alone, and worrying the hell out of my partner. How was he supposed to enjoy himself? 

I am now over a year alcohol free. One of my biggest motivating factors to quit has actually been how much I love my husband. This story is not the only time that my drinking robbed him of an experience, of joy. I hated seeing how much I hurt him and I don't ever want to be that person again. Today, he has been away for 3 days. He's in the middle of a swamp so cell reception is hit and miss. Today, I am able to support his dreams and goals by supporting him on this trip, not being an unnecessary distraction.

I had a year sober once upon a time, 2019 (Jan 1st to Dec. 31st).  Since then, it's been multiple binges, short periods of sobriety, but always right back to the same place.  Last night was another Day 1, I spent the night sweating, sleepless, having terrifying nightmares and panic, pounding heart.  It's the same every time and it's awful, I don't know why I keep giving myself permission to go back, only the end up in the same place.

This sub and you people have been the most helpful and encouraging resource for me so I just wanted to check in again and feel less alone.  Joining you all tonight in not drinking.  Thanks so much for all the encouragement here.

I know most people struggle with weight gain with alcoholism but I seem to have had the opposite problem. It killed my appetite and the hangovers/withdrawals would prevent it from coming back. 

I've always been skinny my whole life. The most I've ever weight was 101lbs over 3 years ago, and I will be 30 years old in September. My current weight is 84lbs (as of Tuesday when I went to the doc, I don't have a scale at home).  

Today is day 7 alcohol free, I don't remember the last time I went a whole week without booze. I had no idea how badly my appetite and chronic stomach issues were taking a hit with my alcoholism and daily consumption. I have my appetite back after a week, finally, and I'm having less and less internal pains on the regular. 

I just went through a pancreatitis scare and a week later, I am still majorly spooked for my health. I don't want to die a slow miserable death due to alcohol and it's irreversible damaging effects. 

Here's to hoping I can get back to my 100+ lbs!! And to my body healing through self-love and care. IWNDWYT. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",19,0

At the beginning of my career, I would drink whiskey or vodka every night - around 3 shots a night. I continued this for maybe 3 years but then managed to do it once a week. One of the main reasons for my drinking was due to my social anxiety, going through a breakup, and some family trauma. I experienced blackout a couple of times and that was the scariest moment of my life. Since then I completely stopped hard spirits such as vodka, whiskey. I knew my limit which was 4 cans of beer which was enough to give me buzz and not give me a hangover the next day. 

I worked pretty hard having 2 jobs so my excuse for relaxation was to drink 4 cans of beer every weekend. This continued for more than a year despite being diagnosed with fatty liver disease. I would get pain in my abdomen every time I drank but it would go away after a couple of days. I always ate healthy which made me believe I‚Äôm not harming myself. I was never physically dependent on alcohol but I definitely knew I had a problem with it. 

A couple of days ago, I drank the usual 4 beers but immediately noticed a sudden onset of pain in my abdomen. It was similar to having cramps, as though my stomach is being very tight. The pain was so bad I couldn‚Äôt sleep the entire night. I threw up everything I ate the day before which wasn‚Äôt even digested properly. I even had a fever from the pain yesterday so I decided to go to a hospital. The doctor gave me some antacids and did some tests done to check for pancreatitis and gastritis. I couldn‚Äôt eat anything yesterday but at the end of the day, I was able to eat some porridge. I feel a lot better today, I still have discomfort in my abdomen but it is not that bad.

I'm a 25-year-old M who didn't have a problem drinking before the pandemic. Like sure - I would have a beer with some friends or get a drink on my days off, but never anything that I was concerned about. Flash forward to the pandemic, I started going from a six-pack a week, to a six-pack every 3 days, to a 6 pack 5 days a week.... then came the harder stuff. At first, I rationalized the harder stuff as a way to save on some calories (I gained some weight... beer and being in quarantine does that, I guess) while still being able to ""relax at the end of the day"" or whatever my description was. This worked out OK for a bit until I started waking up the next day with a nasty hangover and an empty bottle I was supposed to portion out. It's getting to the point where I am starting to be concerned for my health as well as my performance at work and future overall.... I am not sure if I need to completely cut it out for the rest of my life, but something needs to be done.

Even speaking in front of people feels easier. It's still not my favorite thing to do but now it's tolerable. This has proven really helpful at work. Who would have thought haha.

Just one more benefit of sobriety!

The past five years of my 24 year old life have been lost to alcohol and all the shit that comes with it. I could just as well be 18 again because I haven‚Äôt actually lived since then, I‚Äôve been in a drunken coma most of the time. Even happy memories of things I actually was sober for are gone.

I‚Äôve lost so much. Years, memories, myself, possibility of friendships and relationships, experiences, hobbies and interests, joy - LIFE!

I‚Äôm left here with nothing, which makes it even harder to stop, I‚Äôm sure a few of you can relate. Nothing left to lose, I‚Äôve already fucked up so bad why not just go all in while I‚Äôm at it, and all that. *No.* I‚Äôm taking myself and my life back right now. I want to live, I want to be an actual person.

I‚Äôm so incredibly scared of what‚Äôs ahead of me. I know sobriety and recovery is going to be hard, I‚Äôve tried several times, but I think the hardest part is going to be actually *learning to live and become myself*. From simple things just like getting a routine in my days to forming good and healthy relationships, and exploring myself and my personality and mind.

I have nothing to lose still drinking, but everything to gain if I stop.

Thank you to everyone who‚Äôs sharing your journeys on this sub, I wouldn‚Äôt have felt so strong and confident in my decision if it weren‚Äôt for you. Keep up the good work!

I‚Äôve spent the last 2 months in rehab (4 weeks in the hospital and 4 weeks as an outpatient) after heavily drinking (beer, wodka,gin) every night (never during the day) for the last 8 or 9 years.  
It‚Äôs been two months to the day since my last drink.  
Detox itself was relatively easy for me (I‚Äôm sure the meds helped a ton, when I tried just not drinking I had severe withdrawal symptoms).  
The real ‚Äúproblems‚Äù started about 2 weeks ago, I expected things to get easier with every day of not drinking, instead it seems to get harder and harder with every passing day.  
I‚Äôve read a lot of articles and forum posts from people who went to rehab, just to get some kind of Idea about what to expect.  
And it seems to me that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù has so many positive things to tell now that they are no longer drinking, things like:  
 \- ‚ÄúI have so much more energy‚Äù, ‚ÄúI feel like my old self again‚Äù, ‚ÄúI have a new lust for life‚Äù, ‚ÄúEverything is so much easier/better now‚Äù, ‚Äú I see everything so much clearer now‚Äù etc etc.  
 

And this really confuses me, because I feel none of that, even though I sleep more/better and like waking up without a hangover, I have less energy than before (even compared to the time when I was still working full time, I am currently on sick leave).  
 Most of the time I am bored to death, yet can‚Äôt seem to find anything to do that interests me, I have no idea what to do with the free time that I used to spend drinking every evening.

It‚Äôs not even that I miss alcohol per se, on the contrary, the last 2 years I had to force myself to drink just to avoid withdrawal symptoms and I was disgusted by myself and the taste of it (Gin Tonic MAY sound like a nice drink, but not when it is made of 90% gin and 10% tonic).  
Everything just feels kind of empty and to be honest I am really disappointed (mostly in myself but to some extend to the whole ‚Äúlife without alcohol‚Äù aspect of it)    
The only two positive aspects I can really grasp so far are weight loss (about 15 kg / 30 pounds) and the amount of money I have saved by not buying booze in the last 2 months.  
 

Anyone else here experience this ? Any tips?",11,0

I've been on and off of this subreddit for a while now, as I've been on and off of the sobriety train. I kept telling myself that it will be ok, I'm young, I'm supposed to have fun. But with lockdown, as I saw myself stealing my friends booze,  as I became aware of how I could be losing the people I love by how I became, I saw that I can't stop trying to quit.. It has been roughly 18 months of me promising myself that I will get sober, with a few good, strong, months in there; but I always fall to that miserable little voice that tells me that it is not that bad, and that it is fun, that it is an important part of living life to the fullest, and that both me and life are boring without it. I'm still dealing with this stupid voice, and I'm hoping that maybe you guys have some good advice? 

I did start treatment which used both Naltrexone and Antabuse, and I'm excited to see if it works... I must say I'm not as enthusiastic and bubbly about quitting as I was the first few times (I feel a little worn down and defeated), but my god do I want it to stick and am I willing to give my all.. 

How do you guys do it? Hoe do you become dedicated to a way of life that ones brain is so set on classifying as boring? I know I want to be sober, I know this... my brain is just awefully loud, and I am so awefully tired.. 

Thank you guys for listening... 9 days sober, and giving my all.

So knowing this why am I so scared?

I know the progression of things so well. Just coming off a 10 day bender with the last week calling in sick for three days to just drink, pass out, repeat. I estimate 60-70 drinks over the last 10 days. This is a bit extreme, but not unheard of for me. I‚Äôm also not a big guy. I am crazy busy and now having extreme anxiety about all that. Way behind on some projects‚Ä¶

I know I‚Äôm not special in my drinking. I‚Äôve read books, gone to counseling, going to AA for close to three years now. Have a sponsor, call other alcoholics, attend meetings. Why can‚Äôt I stop!

I just don‚Äôt know if I can do it. Ive proved over and over that I can‚Äôt. It happens at least once a month.  I have started feeling good, got my act together. Started working out, sleeping and eating well, you know, all the things normal people do. Then there‚Äôs something, a thought, an activity, a dinner, and I think well I‚Äôll have one and stop. I have this thought even though I know it won‚Äôt happen. I know where it will take me. It‚Äôs the same result every single time and has been for years. I even dry heave thinking about drinking sometimes.

I know I am killing myself. I am in my early 30s and on blood pressure medication, been told my blood sugar is tending towards being pre diabetic. When I drink I get pain on my insides. I am not suicidal, but I can see if I keep doing this for another year or 5, either my body or mind will give out. It‚Äôs unbearable. I am ruining friendships, missing out on relationships, I am selfish and feel like I live only to take. When I‚Äôm not drinking I am the complete opposite. Two different people.

Has anyone been here. Am I hopeless? I can only get back on my feet so many times. It‚Äôs truly progressive and gets worse never better. What can I do when I hit that 10, 15, 20 day mark and inevitably I throw it away. I break and have that one and 3,5, 10 days later I‚Äôm vomiting, diarrhea, not sleeping, my insides hurt and my brain is fire with depression and anxiety. But come the morning, I‚Äôm buying beers at 7am on a Tuesday. I hate this. If anyone can give me some hope, it‚Äôll be much appreciated. I have to do something different then I am doing. I want off this ride once and for all!

UPDATE: thank you for all the support! 

I went to a meeting tonight. Then had dinner and a long conversation with my parents. One is a health care professional and I have confided in them for years. The other one knew, but didn‚Äôt know how much I was struggling. They both didn‚Äôt know how much I drank.

We talked about rehab, therapy, other options. I‚Äôm going to call my MD tomorrow, tell him the full extent of my drinking and how out of hand it becomes and get his advice and maybe a referral to an expert. 

I am going to call my sponsor. My idea is to tell him I think I need a new sponsor. He is wonderful, and has been a great sponsor, but for some reason I don‚Äôt want to let him down and so am not honest with him. I will also need to step down from a commitment I had for a Wednesday meeting. That‚Äôs the rules and will be hard

I plan to do 90 meetings in 90 days. I spoke with my boss and told him why I‚Äôd called in sick. We are close and he was very supportive. Agreed it wasn‚Äôt a problem for me to leave a bit early at 5 a few days a week so that I can get to some 5:30 meetings. 

I‚Äôm also going to tell some close friends who I have never told about my drinking. I‚Äôm tired of living with it in the shadows. It is what is. I‚Äôm an alcoholic and if I am going to hang out with them they need to know that.

That lasted 9 months, and I felt quite good but not ""revelation/miraculous/born again"" good. 

I'm from a Northern English working class background and the drink is thoroughly intertwined into people's lifestyles. I feel more ready to go sober again because I have a comfortable life and I don't live in the UK. I just fear having eyes rolled at me for not wanting to drink with friends, or getting tired early at DJ sets, and maintaining a social life in general. I'm not a sporty person whatsoever, I have a few hobbies and they're great but my outlook is very pessimistic and I never feel like I quite fit in when going to laser tag or crafting classes etc.

I'm quitting alcohol after years of knowing I have a problem and making half-hearted attempts to quit. I've even lurked on the sub off-and-on for years. I didn't quit so many times when I knew I needed to. So many 'wake up calls' left unanswered and 'second chances' wasted-and after every new problem I got my solution was just to drink. I told myself that this year was the time to change all my habits and work on myself, but I just haven't really done anything.

My hair, skin, eyes, expression, body shape, everything seems worse since my problems with alcohol took over. My career and job potential is in the toilet. I've 'tried' to quit so many times before. Gotten vitamins, drank tons of tea, went on walks to distract myself, but every time it felt like I knew I was going to fail. I feel that this time, too, but I don't want to fall back into the same spiral again. I've wasted too much time, squandered too many opportunities, damaged too many relationships, damaged my health, and spent too much money. 

I'm planning on trying to do everything all at once, a new schedule, new habits, like journaling and exercising, and all that. I hate to admit I feel guilty because I don't really want to quit at all. I just want to keep drinking and being an alcoholic and pretending that I'm fine with it. But then I have the 'bad trips' where I say or do something unforgivable, or I realize how many weeks or months I've wasted, and I feel so guilty for not quitting earlier. I'm so tired of the cycle.

It feels like alcohol has bonded itself to so much in my life, a coping mechanism, a good time, an escape, a way to process things, to bond, to enjoy things. It feels like a lifestyle and a hobby, but it's just an addiction. I feel different and entirely worse off since I've developed my drinking problem, like alcohol has seeped into who I am.

Did anyone else feel the 'guilt' or reluctance around actually quitting and committing? Anyone else feel like their image and entire personality have been 'shifted' by drinking/alcoholism?",9,0

I sat silent. Then realized I don‚Äôt actually want to spend time around this person. Some people are just miserable and wanna knock people down to their level. 

It was enlightening to see how much alcohol changed him.  I‚Äôve put so much blame on myself in the past.  I would beat myself up for being angry or whatever. The weight of loyalty to our friendship suddenly didn‚Äôt feel as heavy.  The guilt and shame from the past were greatly reduced.

Many people suggested I shouldn‚Äôt go, and I seriously considered it, but I decided to go.

I showed up Saturday morning, most people were still a little left over from the night before. We golfed 18 holes, the bachelors dad smoked a pork butt along with burgers and brats. We had a good time around the fire pit. People were getting pretty loose towards the end. I decided to drive home at 10pm and make the two hour trip back instead of sleeping in a cabin with a bunch of drunk dudes.

I‚Äôm glad I went. I had a good time and got to see a bunch of friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in a long time. It also reaffirmed that I can do things sober, that I don‚Äôt need to drink every time I golf, or hang out with friends. I did let quite a few people know prior to the party that I wasn‚Äôt going to be drinking. A few people asked me if I wanted a beer or why I stopped drinking but it was mostly a non-issue. I also made a strong commitment to myself on the drive over that I wasn‚Äôt going to drink today and if it got to the point where I felt compelled to drink I was leaving. 

Funny side note.  When I fired my truck up to drive home, the bachelors dad came running over to me asking what the hell I was doing. He was all pissed off that I was drinking and driving. I told him I was sober, hadn‚Äôt drank anything, and I was heading home. He shook my hand, said good for you and drive safe.",11,0

Barely believe it to be honest. Started this journey 10 weeks ago, in the last weekend of May, and now it's August already. Ten years ago I'd have found two months of sobriety a waste of life. A year ago it sounded like something impossible to achieve. And now sobriety feels completely natural and the way life should be.

Just wanted to tell you being sober all the time is nice. Veeeery nice indeed. Can't even remember how I incorporated alcohol in my life now. I am no longer fighting cravings or thinking about alcohol all day every day anymore either. It feels good to actually live my life instead of being a prisoner of my own mind.

I am a changed person already. I used to be a scared, anxious and very emotional girl. Now, after just two months of sobriety, I feel pretty comfortable in my own skin most of the time. I feel like I'm finally getting to know myself too. And for the first time in my adult life I am confident I can be happy.

It might be normal for most people but I think it's amazing to see how far I've come in this short while. I just love going to bed now for example. I used to be so scared of my thoughts I absolutely hated going to bed because it meant I had to be alone with them. I still go to bed too late often but now that's because of positive reasons like being busy with hobbies or talking to nice people. When I do go to bed now I am able to direct my thoughts and feel very relaxed. And my skin... I was so incredibly ugly when I still drank. I found looking at my skin scary, really. Now it's okay, I guess. Definitely not scary anymore and good enough to not freak out when people look at me too. I should have taken before pictures but I never believed I'd change this much this quick. Or even make it to two months for that matter.

And while writing this I realized I think I am no longer suicidal. How crazy is that? Got a little teary-eyed because of that lol. Haven't made plans or done anything reckless in weeks and I am even looking forward to making it to my thirtieth birthday. Did not think this was possible up until a few weeks ago. Feels really weird to not want to die lol

How I got here in short:

- melatonin for the first two weeks. Started sleeping properly after a week

- lots of sweets in the first month. I ate A LOT and most of it was technically unhealthy but it got me here so the butt load of chocolate and other things might actually have been the healthiest stuff I ever ate

- lots of new and old hobbies. First to distract myself constantly then to get myself into a decent rhythm and now to enjoy life again

- excercise. Also first to distract myself but nowadays to boost my confidence and energy levels and to feel a kind of lust for life

- nature. Everyone needs something beautiful in their lives

- this place of course!!!!!! For motivation, tips, tricks, distractions, rants and I don't know what else

I truly feel okay with my life now. I truly believe there are way more good things than bad things in life. There are still bad times coming but now I'm pretty confident they won't get me down again. I see everything as an opportunity to improve my life now instead of something that's trying to prove I should quit.

Two months... My life finally has meaning and I am looking forward to the rest so much now.

I must have forgotten a lot of what I wanted to say so you can ask me anything if you like. 

Thank you all. Love you!!!

As if drinking again would allow me to re-experience the highs of drinking to excess, primarily from in college a few years ago.

I had a stretch of time back when I started drinking where I seemingly had no consequences despite having these frequent blackout experiences - often combined with a hookah buzz and a high from smoking. I just loved the feeling of getting to blackout, like it was a surreal thing for me. Music always teleported me, and if I went out wandering drunk I‚Äôd look at it as an adventure with a soundtrack.

I think that‚Äôs something that always set me apart from my other friends - I could start the night with the plan to just ‚Äúsocial drink‚Äù, but my apparent morbid curiosity and desire for chaos always steered me to a blackout. These days, I‚Äôll maybe hear a song I used to play while drinking and suddenly I get this little movie to play in my head, full of these vignettes of blackout memories. 

It‚Äôs been a challenge to process these. I think keeping busy and writing about this has helped me a lot, but it seems like what I‚Äôm missing most these days about not drinking is the lack of escapism.",3,0

This year has been by far one of the most challenging of my life and one that I‚Äôve had to fight really hard to get through. My entire life I have bottled things up, pushed through obstacles, and just tried to stay on the ‚Äúright path‚Äù (go to high school, go to a good college, get good grades, make a lot of friends, have fun, graduate and get a high paying job etc.). In January, I finally started to talk about some of the things going on in my life and opened up to my doctors about struggling with an eating disorder for the past 5 years. Tired of suffering from a multitude of traumas and mental illnesses, I was super hesitant but trying to ask for help. The next few months it felt like everything blew up in my face and got 10x worse despite now getting help. Every week I go to my doctor for weights and vitals, therapy appointments, nutritionist appointments, programs ‚Äî and until the end of March I was balancing school on top of this + drinking more and more in order to stop thinking about all of it and the stress I was under. In March, I was hospitalized after a serious suicide attempt from drinking and was held in the inpatient psych unit for a week following. After my inpatient stay, I was in another partial hospitalization program which was largely unhelpful and I am now in an outpatient program at a different clinic. My drinking has always been a problem, but I‚Äôve continued to explain it away, lie, and make excuses for how much, how  often, and when drink. Now nearing the end of the summer, alcohol and drugs still have a strong hold on me, despite the progress I‚Äôve made. Alcohol has ruined my relationship with my amazing boyfriend, my relationship with my family, job opportunities, and academics. I‚Äôve known for a while now that if I want to live a happy and successful life I need to be sober ‚Äî there is no other way. These past few weeks have been the first time I‚Äôve been able to question these impulses and cravings and make better choices.

I was doing well not drinking (or drinking in moderation) at my old city. But here I‚Äôve reverted to old ways drinking every weekend for multiple days. I guess it‚Äôs my way of coping and getting myself to socialize. 

Last night I drank by myself tho. I got 3 hours of sleep. Woke up at 5am with nausea and severe anxiety. Sitting still helped the Nausea but made the anxiety worse, moving around helped the anxiety but made the nausea/dizziness worse. 

I already posted today how I‚Äôm done, drinking is over mainly because of how I feel today.  Starting to feel better now but still struggling. 

But also, I got out and walked down the bike path near my apartment as moving around is definitely better for me than sitting and stewing. And well, I didn‚Äôt realize how nice this area is and how I can take this bike path to different parts of the city quickly and easily. There are even little coffee shops on the path along the way. 

In a weird way. I may not have discovered this without my hangover. But as I walked I also realized I don‚Äôt need to drink. There are things to discover in this city. I kinda refocused on things I can do besides drink instead of focusing on how I feel. Without this hangover I would have stayed in and played video games all day and then probably would have drank again next weekend until I had another ‚Äúwake up call‚Äù hangover.

So many of you have helped me over and over again on my journey.  u/cinqmillionreves has been by my side the whole time, even when we first, first started four years ago.  Glad you found me again.  :)  Brings a smile to my face!!

I said this in DCI already, but I'll repeat it here.  It was asked, ""What makes my sobriety work?""

Back when I was drinking I used to talk a lot.  About things I wanted.  Things I desired.  I used to dream about these things while drinking with a friends.  We would talk and talk and talk endlessly about playing music together.  About having my own home.  Having a good healthy relationship with family, friends and work.  Guess what was happening??  

None of it.  It was all talk.

See....the problem was that I would talk about these things and get excited.  Feel positive and hopeful that these things are going to happen.  Then when I would wake up hungover and too tired to make any of these things happen, it was awfully depressing.  Get past it and do it all over again.  And again and again and again.

My life now is way different.  Of course not EVERYTHING I desire has happened or will ever happen, but that's not even the point.  The point is that I finally recognized what I have to do in order to make it POSSIBLE for me to try to achieve these desires.  Take the drinking/hangovers away and all I had left was the dreams and the motivation to actually try to make them happen.

With 100 days left to my one year milestone I look to the future with great hope.  And I couldn't have done it without you.

Thank you from the very bottom of my heart SD.  Much love for all of you!!

Countless people here, myself included, did the same thing. We told ourselves time and time again ""I'm not going to drink like that anymore."" only to wake up exactly like you're feeling right now. 

I remember feeling scared during those times. Scared that I'd lost control of myself. Scared about what people would think if they knew I had become an alcoholic. I was scared that I was helpless. I could feel my body and mind beginning to break down because of it, and I was scared there was nothing I could do to fix it again. 

Moreover I was scared about trying to live life without alcohol. Without that daily routine of comfort and habit. That well deserved ice cold one after work. That was MINE, god dammit, I EARNED that. It was the only way I knew how to relax and unwind and why should I deprive myself of that? 

I was simultaneously repulsed and attracted to it. Wanting to leave it behind in the mornings, only to find myself with a drink in my hand 8 hours later and on my way to another miserable morning. 

The cycle is horrible, I know. It's like you're trapped in a life that endlessly loops back on itself, every day repeating the same thing and knowing where you'll end up again. 

I drank daily for 20 years. I had only alcohol to comfort and relax me. It was a part of every facet of my life. Putting that down seemed impossible. But it's not.

I looked at it as retiring from drinking, not quitting. It sounded more like a win for me, instead of a failure. Quitting sounded dire to me. Like I was intentionally doing something because I had to (and I HAD to...) for reasons I couldn't control. Retiring is a choice made by someone in charge and in control. 

I retired because I'd finally drank enough. I'd drank my way to the finish line of alcoholism with severe physical and mental dependencies. I won.

There was nothing left to do with alcohol except stay in that same endlessly looping life. 

Sure, you'll be miserable for a while when you do put it down, that much is certain. Whether it be a physical withdrawal or the mental conviction and courage to refuse that next drink, it exacts a toll. It's exhausting. But it's not forever. I promise you it's not forever. 

No one who truly cares about you will think badly about it if you quit drinking. No one should ever judge you for wanting to improve yourself. If they do, then they aren't healthy for you to be around. They might just want you to keep drinking so they can justify their own habit. 

I dunno. Think about it. In the meantime, get some rest. Drink some water. Sleep. You'll feel better in a few hours. And then you'll reach that crossroad where you can get off that endless loop. Where you have that first thought of ""I should get a drink..."" that will come later today. You know the one. 

Yeah. That one. That's the intersection. That's the exit. To say ""no"". 

We'll be here.

They divorced when I was about 10, those years are fuzzy because of the brains ability to block out painful memories.

Setting the scene with that, I spent my 20s and good portion of my 30s drinking and seeking validation, more drinking than seeking validation. 

My brother passed away in 2015 at age 36 from a sudden cardiac incident and that sent me into an even deeper spiral with drinking, I think I polished off a 6 pack in the parking lot of the funeral home prior to delivering his eulogy.

I was depressed and a drunk, I was trying to actively kill myself with alcohol since I figured at the time it'd be nicer than a pistol in my mouth, I'd been down that road as well.

March 19th 2018 I got sober after I proposed to my now wife, I couldn't bear the thought of her having to take care of me after I'd ruin myself with alcohol. I got sober because I was tired, I was so tired of keeping up the act.

Sobriety has provided me the very things I was missing, I have a strong marriage that I am present for, we bought our 1st home together, Im no longer bouncing around from job to job, we are adoptive parents.

None of this could have been possible for me without my sobriety, so I hope if you are questioning yours today that this brings some relief to you, just keep going it does get better.

Ill have to go back to the bar to see if they are there. Either way, I need to stop completely again.

This subreddit helped me immensely at the beginning of my recovery. I was on here daily dropping IWNDWYTs. Thank you all for fighting the good fight with me. 

The most powerful moment just happened. I was scrolling through Reddit and saw the post about dry-August. Been a while since I participated in this subreddit, but I decided to chime in anyways, also wondering what day I'm on, as my flair would show up after I commented. 

Guys, 999!!!! What the heck. I've been studying numerology all year and according to numerology, numbers with the same repeating digits are Master Numbers and 999 is an exceptional Master Number because when you add up 9+9+9=27 and then add up 2+7=9! Not all Master Numbers do this, so 999 is extra 9 energy. 

Nine is the number of completion. It's the highest single-digit number and represents completing one cycle to start another cycle. Specifically, from Google, here's was 999 represents:

""It is both the end of old habits, beliefs, and relationships and the beginning of newness. When you see 999, it's time to release the past, learn from old issues, forgive yourself and others, and start the process of healing to become the best, most powerful version of yourself.""

When I was a drunk, I was wasting nearly $10k a year on booze and just straight up not living up to my life potential. In these 999 days, I've saved up enough for a down payment on a house. I'm currently just waking up in a no-frills Motel in the town I may one day call home. The reason I'm here is to buy a house. I'd be the first homeowner in my family. I get to break the poverty cycle. This is my first time talking to a realtor and will be my first time looking at buying a property. I have my checkbook in hand and if all goes well, this could be the biggest day of my life. This would be turning point. The end of one cycle, starting of the next. To say 999 resonates with me right now would be an understatement. 

Some people would call this a coincidence, but I'd call it a synchronicity.

Just got a clean bill of health which I want to preserve as I had been a tad worried leading up to my tests. But, I was bad on Friday night. I took the day off, elected to meet a friend (longtime drinking buddy, but a real friend since 1st grade). We have totally supported each other when we've both tried in vain to quit in the past. However when we get together? We both are bad influences on each other. Anyways, I had a few beers with lunch because well, I guess I got bored and didn't want to go back to my empty house. Of course, on the way home I decided to buy more beer! And that's how that day went. I ended up contacting him later in the day to see if he wanted to meet up AGAIN that day which meant have even more beers. I felt generally okay yesterday, but certainly was a bit angry at myself. The simple reason is I have dodged a bullet health wise, and was feeling great over the last week, eating better, moving more. So, I am back on the wagon and really do plan to walk away from my drinking career for good. Friend is going through an awful divorce, splitting him from his children, house, etc. So, he is suddenly around more than he had been in a while and is kind of stuck living with his mother for the next several months while he rebuilds his life. He is like my best friend but I also can't afford to slip up repeatedly. So I will need to also be selfish at times to maintain my sobriety, but I also can't cut him out when he needs me more than ever. Again, I can't afford to relapse even though what happened recently was NOT his fault. I had craved beer and probably would've stopped somewhere for lunch on my own. Kind of confusing and difficult situation I find myself in. However, today is like 65 degrees, sunny and I'm closing in on 48 hours from when the poison left my system. Life is so much more beautiful when I'm sober and the sun is shining. I wish I would truly let this sink in so I NEVER pickup a beer no matter how much I begin to romanticize it. I have never been physically addicted but I associate it with not being anxious, becoming more social, etc. I hope others can understand. I probably also sound like a broken record since I post similar things every couple weeks. But...

\-started lifting weights, now can lift a decent amount, developed muscles ha! (not huge however)

\-joined local bike group, now bike on Friday afternoons with a group instead of getting a buzz, regularly complete 50, 75, and even 100 mile rides

\-learned how to mountain bike on trails (still wimpy and still not good but don't care)

\-taught both my kids 2 sports, played with them daily, both on high school varsity teams in respective sports.................NEVER had energy to go out after work to teach or work with them, now they have a purpose, a team/friends, and are setting goals for themselves

\-joined a non-profit that helps people in wheelchairs play sports locally

\-joined a local 'nature' group that plants trees in a local park, helped raise money and actually went out and planted over 100 trees

I was not mentally or physically ready to do this, but their schedule finally allowed a visit, so I put on my big boy pants and let it happen. In the past, all we did was drink with these two. They have a damn bar in their house that is fully stocked 24/7, so any visit was an excuse to over-indulge with their glowing permission and encouragement. They live about 60 miles away, so the ride home (I never drove) was always a long blurry trip along I 94 back to our house. They have kids as well, and one summer we shared a beach house in Saugatuck, MI, and the drinking went to insane amounts with their five teen-aged boys and our two kids running amok. The stress level during this trip was crazy. Some vacay. They got married in their backyard a few summers ago, and I stupidly stopped by the bar in the house, grabbed a beer and went to their backyard to watch the ceremony. The stuffy wedding planner came up behind me and hissed in my ear: ‚ÄúThe beer is for AFTER the ceremony!‚Äù and huffed off. I was embarrassed beyond words but drank it anyway. 

It was very odd to be the sober one during this visit, and to discuss my sobriety with them. The one guy, a fellow college prof, had questions about how I did it and was eager to learn more about Naltrexone and how it affected drinking. He still wants his whiskey, so he‚Äôs weighing options using TSM. 

I mentioned how good my sleep is since stopping drinking and his comment was ‚ÄúI thought the whiskey helped me sleep, but I think it actually doesn‚Äôt!‚Äù Bingo. We may have a convert people! Do I get a toaster? Is there a punch card for this? 

At dinner, at a loud tap room/pizzeria, I watched them all get slowly hammered on beer as the conversation got louder and louder. I sipped on my iced tea and took it all in as the new sober DD. So what started as a pretty anxious and stressful afternoon turned out to be a pretty nice night sitting outside sipping my hot tea and getting eaten by the massive mosquitos here in MI. 

Sobriety is relearning, rethinking, and reassessing everything in your life, including your friendships and relationships. It‚Äôs not always pleasant (as there were many icky drunk memories from their gatherings in my brain) but in the end, we focus on the present and move forward.

We were visiting friends in London and went to a pub to see a band that my friend knew. She did ask me ahead of time if we were OK to go, but I thought I‚Äôd have to face it sometime so agreed.

We ended up dancing the night away. My friend‚Äôs fianc√© got really drunk and we ended up taking him home about midnight and he nearly threw up on the tube - how embarrassing!

Then when we got home they ordered pizza (another of my usual bad drinking decisions) and waited an hour for it to arrive only for it to be disgusting. I was in bed for the majority of this, fast asleep and comfortable in the knowledge I had a good time sober!

In the morning my friend and her fianc√© were really hungover but still made a good effort of doing the tourist thing with us all day.

The 'high' of alcohol only lasts for around 20 minutes. It's **not worth it**. Learning to 'feel' without an escape is hard, but a life where you are reliant on a substance is much harder.

You've fought really hard to get where you are today, whether it be Day 1, Day 100 or Day 1000. Don't let a temporary feeling jeopardise that.

Whatever you're going through will pass. Tomorrow's you will thank you for not drinking today. You've got this.",308,0

I thought I would share with you my progress so far. 
I‚Äôve gone from about 20 units a day, every day, to pretty much one glass of wine on a day when I DECIDE to have a drink. 
See my drinking calendar here: 

https://imgur.com/gallery/o0NVV6u

You will see my tapering in the first week followed by a run of alcohol free days - something which had previously been unheard of for me in the last 5 or so years! 
I wanted to gain control of my decisions of when to drink and to be able to enjoy alcohol again rather than have it control me, and so far, so good. The drinks I have consumed have either been 1 x glass of wine with a meal or a G&T. The red block on the calendar is the exception! I was going to a concert and had decided in advance that I was going to have a session: 2 glasses of wine, 3 lagers and a G&T. And boy did I feel hanging the next day üòñ.  Prior to my moderation efforts I would have just had a lager in the morning to take the edge off and then carried on with my day. Not this time though! Mentally, it‚Äôs strange - having that hangover reminded me of the progress I‚Äôd made and reinforced my determination to get this under control. 

I have thrown myself into exercise and am thinking about the workouts I would have to do to burn off those empty calories that alcohol would provide. I‚Äôve lost 5.5kg in weight, 2% body fat, look healthier and feel greater than I have for years. I‚Äôm less anxious, less stressed, sleep is amazing and my skin is so soft! My arthritis flare ups have also reduced in severity. I‚Äôm eating healthily; a balanced diet with more lean white meat and less red, lots of fibre, reduced salt and saturated fats and drinking a lot more water. Regular digestion and ‚Äúmovements‚Äù - I‚Äôd forgotten what it was like! (I won‚Äôt provide TMI on that one!)

So, there you have it. The first month on my long (and hopefully permanent) journey to taking back control of my life.",2,0

Obviously, automatically depressed. I remember saying to her before we broke up that I would happily end my life if we were not together (not a scare tactic, just how hopeless I would be). For two months after the break up, we still lived together. I didn't drink (to save money before I moved back to my hometown). 

We were so civil and supportive with each other. The day came that I moved on and I hit alcohol so badly. For two months straight, I drank 6 - 8 cans of something a night.

I decided to quit at the end of June. And its been getting easier ever since. I replaced a drink with a diet coke or water. Been getting a lot of sleep. Going to the gym and just transforming into a better person.

I am going further with this sobriety forever more.

It may seem hard to not drink for a long time but its nothing but glory in the end.

Some thoughts on observing drinking culture sober.,"I did not drink. Hair metal cover band. Was okay I guess, I think best if you had nostalgia. I personally think metal has vastly improved since the 1980s and like sludgier droney stuff with a kick you in the chest bass and distorted vocals; I digress.

Did a lot of people watching sitting on the bleachers.

The bodies of middle age heavy drinkers is very obviously a drinking body, and they don't look good. All these people were not really in the shape they could have been in the 1980s to dance or have a functioning pit, and it was obvious watching the people standing around down front.

It's really not a great look to have 2 tall boy coors light that you can prop on your belly, or carrying 6 white claws back to the group.

The wide stance to walk through sand as someone's eyes are dead center on the beer line but they gotta center themselves and widen their stance to accommodate the drunkenness.

The power drinking beer stance of someone who has drank beer for 30 years is also obvious.

The high heels, falling over trying to walk in the sand, chugging white claw and your ass and belly both struggling to fit in the dress is also not a good look.

Being around drinking without drinking really sucks. Drinking culture is pretty shitty, and part of why I don't want to drink as much is how much I hate it.

Being at the concert with dirty sweat pants, and a grease stained shirt that says: ""but is there beer""

I've had 5-8 or so drinks, 3 sessions over last 2-3 months. Big reduction from using that much near daily beforehand for 2ish years and lighter usage a handful of years before that.

I wouldn't mind finding a balance of getting drunk under 5 times a year for some kinda event, but the daily drinking is gonna fucking kill me one day, and I'll die metaphorically far before then.

Gone to a few hundred AA meetings and something I realized from that is I am at an early stage of alcoholism where the major physical dependency hadn't started, the major life sucks hadn't started but I know daily or even regular drinking is gonna lead me on a roller coaster to destruction. I gotta get off that roller coaster.

Hey guys!

So I thought I would put pen to paper (figuratively) and write about why I stopped drinking and how I came to that point. Sorry about the writing, its more stream of conscience than well edited prose.

In 2013 a friend of mine who I was homebrewing with for a few years said we should start a brewery. We both had our toe in areas around the scene and had both the production and sales area covered between the two of us. We scavenged a little bit of money from our wives and built a small system at my house from scratch. Within a few months of the release of our beers we had to move to a bigger facility. We built another brewery there and installed what I thought would be 5-10 years of capacity but within a year we had outgrown it and couldn't produce enough or fit in all the crazy people that would actually like to come drink at our venue. So we started looking and found another site 5 times bigger nearby and began building another venue and brewery. A year later we opened up that site and have been growing it since (two years now) but once again maxed production capacity but I'm not really interested in building again so we're here to stay. In the end we have a very successful business that we're proud of and employ 35 people that we think of as our giant family.

During these last 8-10 years beer and alcohol has become a big part of my life in so many ways. I would drink it for refreshment, relaxation and for business. Its what paid my wages and put food on the table. It was part of my social life at the brewery. People would come in and always want to sit down and have a beer with me, 'Have a beer with the brewer!', all part of the friendly atmosphere the brewery was known and loved for. Nearly every night we were open I was there drinking and entertaining customers or other people in the industry and the beer was literally on tap right there in front of me and I didn't need my arm twisted to have a drink. It was great and I was happy and it helped me deal with the rapid growth stress that came with the business.

But on the flipside there were the inevitable negative outcomes this caused; My wife stopped making a plate of dinner for me as she was never sure when I would be home, my children really didn't see a lot of me, I used to drink drive a lot until I finally got caught and then add to this the list of embarrassing drunk moments I wish to forget.

Also running under all of this was my depression I was dealing with. Taking shitty medication daily that certainly worked but if I missed a couple of days I would turn into a fucking arsehole. And then mix in alcohol on those days and I made the people around me really question why they would want to be friends with me. And this is what led me to stop drinking.

It was one specific event that saw me give up the beers. I wont go into a lot of detail as it still hurts a lot to recount it but basically I was on a business trip interstate with my family and on one of the last days my wife and I decided to checkout all the local breweries. She was driving so I was going to have a few. Ended up at a whiskey distillery (I don't normally drink spirits straight but in Rome etc..) and I had a few in quick succession and cant really remember a lot after that. We picked up our kids from the grandparents and were heading back to our hotel when I gave the wrong directions, wifey wasn't too happy with me and let me know. I cracked it at the accusations. Lost my shit completely. Tried to get out of the moving vehicle to escape. Children crying in the backseat. Got out but got caught in the door and dragged down the road. Bloody and busted I wandered around. I rang friends, spoke about suicide, made a lot of accusations, caused a lot of drama but eventually I got myself to a hospital. Lied to the paramedics about what happened to me as it was all too embarrassing. 2 broken ribs and a hell of a lot of skin missing I was put in the recovery ward to sleep off the alcohol.

Next morning in hospital I made the realisation that I cant keep drinking. I was about to lose my family, then likely my business and also all my friends. I headed back to the hotel, managed to speak to my wife who said she would keep the kids interstate for awhile while I worked myself out. Got back to my home, talked to my GP, got on some meds for alcoholics, got a psychologist booked in and set about trying to fix myself up.

And now here I am. 3 months sober, still working every day around alcohol. Still making it, keeping QC happening and have even judged 80 plus beers at an industry competition without swallowing any of it. I can make it work but its far from easy. I miss drinking the beers we make. I miss the social interaction.

I miss being drunk and being happy.

But I'll push on.

Cheers!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Nearly four years ago, I made my first post here on StopDrinking. It was a thank you post, and said,

> Finding this community was like tumbling out of the dark rabbit hole, out of a world I just didn't understand, into a world where things make sense. The first day I read a whole lot of posts, and then the guidelines > faq > common questions. I read the question ""Am I the only one who..."" and the full stop answer, ""No you are not.""

Meeting the community changed my life. For the first time, I realized I was not alone, and I was struck by the kindness and compassion of you sobernauts.

After I became a mod I got a deeper understanding of the first rule of the sub: **""Be kind""**. Such a simple rule, with all the power in the world! It allows people like me, and maybe you, to take those first insecure steps out of the cold, and begin to build something new. I would never have done that if I was struck down by sarcastic know it alls every time I opened my mouth.

I felt totally and completely drained after waking up, and then having to do it again tonight was not a good time. I felt like I was wearing a mask, trying to pretend I wasn‚Äôt tired and socially drained when I was. 
I‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôm going to lose this friendship because I can‚Äôt be that person. Does anyone have any advice or similar experiences? I would really appreciate it.",7,1

I decided to join them because I wanted some post work socialization. It was a good work day but it was also very long and I want to know my coworkers better.

I'm in the hospitality industry, and sometimes it can feel like I'm the only person who doesn't drink. The three of them all had 2 pints of beer or cider. I had two ginger beers (ginger beer is non alcoholic) while we all sat and chatted. 

I had a great time, but I could feel my brain coming up with excuses for why it would be ok for me to have one. It was actually the largest craving for booze that I have had in a very long time. 

I think I've identified the cause of the craving - It's been four and a half months since I have stopped drinking, and in that time I have had plenty of experience deciding not to drink when I'm by myself. There have been many times where I have declined drinking when my partner opts to have some wine very frequently. I have chose not to drink while friends have decided to have a few beers. But this was my first time sitting with coworkers after work and not drinking while the rest of my work friends were drinking. And post work sitting at the bar is something my brain *heavily* associates with drinking from past experience. 

But I made it through. And you know what, despite the craving and experiencing a little bit of FOMO, I had a great time. I feel proud that I get to go to sleep knowing that I have enough self assurance to stick to my goals. I also feel proud that I get to post here about me sticking to my commitment to myself.

And most importantly, since I've done it one time, I know that the next time will be easier. Breaking the habit of drinking gets easier each time you have a new experience and you prove to yourself you don't need alcohol to get through it. 

Anyways, I hope that all of you have a fantastic weekend, and IWNDWYT!",22,0

I came home and took a 2 hour nap while it rained. 

I woke up and sketched my next painting for a few hours. 

My friend came over later who is an amazing blues guitar player. I tuned my upright bass and we played together for a few hours.

I put on comfy pajamas and did my skin care routine.

Where would I be drunk? I would have watched Netflix all day. Smoked cigarettes. Probably updated some dumb shit on Facebook. Probably texted someone I didn't want to text. Fallen asleep bloated and gross. Would have woken up at 2am tossing and turning with my heart racing. And the worst part, I'd wake up the next morning hungover, anxious, and filled with regret. I'd ask myself why did I do this again knowing this would be the result?

I love this life so much now. I'm so glad I haven't felt that in 11 months. Just comparing my Saturdays to what they used to be makes me so happy. üòÄ",24,0

Just wanted to give you some chill/relaxing ideas of things to do to keep you busy while handling some really hard cravings. 

1. Crochetting and knitting. HEAR ME OUT, MEN. You might think its stupid, but you know what you can do once you learn it? One of the easiest designs and most helpful is making hats. Specifically, hats for newborns. A friend does this and donates all of them to the local delivery suite. They spray them all down with lysol and let them sit for a week or two to kill anything off and then they are given to the wee ones! You can also knit socks for homeless shelters (socks are #1 in what is asked for in all homeless shelters!) So you learn a hobby, give back to the community, and feel better. :) Plus its super easy to do at home and it keeps your mind and hands busy
2. Paint by number kits. Love these when I am white knuckling because they force me to feel like I am completing something, calm me down, and keep me focused on the art rather than needing a beer. Ive had hours and hours pass without realizing it- even with white knuckling it. 
3. Learn to bake bread. All different types. This is delicious, fun, fairly cheap, and labor intensive. meaning it keeps your mind and hands busy!
4. Do something for someone you love. Your cat or dog, grandma, spouse or kids. Make something for them and then gift it. Theyve earned some love and attention from you.

If anyone wants to give more ideas, bring it on!",7,0

I‚Äôm an emotional wreck still, but at least I‚Äôm sober and able to work through the feelings, as terrible as they may be. 

I also wrote a lengthy message to my siblings explaining the various mental and physical health challenges I‚Äôve been experiencing for the last year(s) and it was a bit of a load off my shoulders. We‚Äôll see how it goes from here.
