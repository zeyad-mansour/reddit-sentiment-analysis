For the past decade, I very rarely had an appetite for anything sweet, so I'd rarely eat dessert or fruit.

Since stopping, I regularly get sweet cravings. I satisfy it with fruit most of the time for obvious health reasons, but I can devour a bowl of candy if you leave it in front of me. Luckily, I now also have the energy to burn those calories off.

Anyone else experience this? I love it!",13,0

I’ve caught myself reflecting on it multiple times daily since then. I can’t say the book has put me off drinking FOR LIFE, but it certainly made me lose all desire to drink now. It hit me full in the face. I realized reading it that I have so much to lose and nothing to gain by continuing to drink alcohol.

This is the first time I feel like I’m in control. I’m not lusting after alcohol constantly. I want to recommend this book to folks in my life because of how powerfully it changed my opinion in just a few hours, but I am not going to. I’m going to stay quiet about my sobriety and just let it all speak for itself. Besides, most folks don’t want to hear what this book has to say.

I considered my life looking forward where I would never drink again. I panicked at the thought. My entire perception of fun and relaxation and travel and good times all involved having a drink. If I couldn't drink, how could I enjoy sitting on a beach without a fruity cocktail? How could I enjoy a fancy dinner without a glass of wine? How could I have a deep late night conversation without a brandy or a scotch? The list goes on.

This feeling of panic and uncertainty about my future lasted a while. But then I remembered that I had felt like this before at other times in my life when I faced a major change. When I left home to go to university. When I left university and moved to a city for a job where I knew no one. When I stopped being single and dating and started a serious relationship. When I had kids. All of these events represented monumental upheavals in my status quo. All of them had good points and bad points. They were all phase changes that life presents. I adapted before. I can do so again.

I used to deal with this panic of a no-drinking future but telling myself that in a few months or maybe a year, once I've ""reset my system"" that I would be able to start drinking again. That I could manage it in moderation and only for those times that called for it. I don't think about it like that any more. I have changed how I think about alcohol. Instead of a rewarding treat, I see it as a damaging poison. The next phase of my life will be sober and healthy. I'm looking forward to it.",8,0

In January I was attending meetings and working the steps and almost made it 60 days. 
But looking back, I realized I wasn’t getting sober for me. I was getting sober to salvage a relationship that was a toxic mess partially due to my(our) drinking.
I relapsed in February after realizing the relationship was not going to be what I wanted it to be. I was still angry at him.
I went on a date with a new guy, and guess what.i did? 
Got drunk.
The date was terrible and it wasn’t worth it, and I knew I was in for ruin before leaving to meet this person.
Cut to a few months later- it’s June, we’re in a global crisis and my drinking is now completely out of hand. 
I started to have extreme anxiety again, along with: heart palpitations that would last all day, numbness in my digits from sleeping in poor position drunk, I would avoid picking up the phone, taking out the trash, exercising, and eating regular healthy meals.
I decided I couldn’t live like that anymore. I was suffering. And I was trying to continue my Buddhist practice. (Meditating and alcohol do not mix- in fact, it’s an impossible combination).
The first three days were tricky and slow. But it got easier. 
My 30th birthday is on Tuesday. I start a new job on Monday. 
And despite the great turmoil the world is facing, I have inner peace.

The exeriment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's reading was about how some people believe that alcohol has the ability to relieve sadness. Annie talks about: 


-How the media portrays people turning to alcohol to take the edge off or to not feel sadness. While alcohol does relieve the feeling, it does not last for long.


-When alcohol is consumed, it let's of a biphasic (two phase) response in the brain. The first drink stimulates the pleasure response but when BAC begins to dip, counter chemicals are released. Often times, the majority of negative feelings are felt when the person is sleeping, so they are unaware of the negative feelings. 


-She continues by stating that pain and sadness are a reality in life and they are normal and natural. She talks about how great things come from painful situations (childbirth). She uses the analogy of a seed. A seed has to break through its outer shell, establish roots, and then begin growing into a tree. 


#""Depression lies to us and alcohol makes those lies believable""


I dont believe I was ever depressed growing up. I had my fair share of teenage angst and moments I would cringe about later, but I never felt them for long. As time moved on and I drank more, I felt more and more depressed. Even though, things were mostly going well in my life. Then, I had a bad job, drank more, and those feelings amplified. I even began self harming (I ended up stopping that rather quickly) when I was drinking at the age of 28. I had never done that before. I just wanted to be in control of something. 


The depression, anxiety, and shame are all reasons I am now alcohol free. I am so much happier now that I am not drinking and have shifted my mind frame on drinking.

I was driving in an unfamiliar area, and drove through a roundabout.  There was another car speeding coming at the other side, and I think they thought I was going to come to a stop, but I yieleded and continued (I’m not sure if I was in the wrong, they had more than enough time to stop, I may have been supposed to completely stop, they might not have had a yield, I may have genuinely made a mistake), but either way they were going nearly 40 in a 25.  It’s not even that I cut them off or they had to slam the brakes, I think they got irritated that they had to slow down.

They followed me and tailgated me and begun honking aggressively at me, and followed me down an empty street and ran me off the side of the road and screamed at the window that I “almost hit their car”, went on a very angry rant to “make me aware”.  I am extremely anxious right now, embarrassed and anxious that I possibly made a traffic mistake, and just anxious over the road rage driver following me, pushing me into a ditch and it seeming like it would turn into a physical altercation.  I just ignored everything and closed my eyes and shut down and they drove off.

I feel super panicky and am in the parking lot of a 711 and feel like I need to drink after 3 months of sobriety to alleviate the intense anxiety after this.  Idk what I’m asking I guess I just needed to post and write this out.  I don’t think I will actually drink I just feel the most anxious I ever have in my life.  Is it normal to make traffic mistakes?  I have made mistakes where I have cut someone off and it seemed like I genuinely almost caused an accident in the past, but this did not seem like one.  I genuinely had no idea why the guy was following me or what I did until he was screaming about “almost hitting him at the roundabout”.

I honestly think that’s the point where my live changed and it’s as if I’ve been numbing myself with alcohol. I can’t go on like this and I’ve now got 2 stone to lose as a result. I do okay for a while and then fuck up. I’m just so done :( I woke up today with the shame and embarrassment of the night before and the concerns of what my children take from my behaviour.

When I think rationally it’s very ‘okay, so just don’t drink, eat well and exercise’ but right now it feels like a mountainous task and all I can do is continue to beat myself up for letting myself get like this in the first place.

I’m past the cravings for the most part but man. Brain fog, hard to fall asleep, not managing stress well some days. But I’m back to working out regularly and trying to heal up. All of this is proof I need to be sober. That my body has to adjust this much just to be sober. 

I’m really hoping this fog and the digestive issues clear up soon. Meeting with my doc today to make sure all the stuff I’m experiencing is normal and what I can do to help. I feel like I’m constantly hungry sort of, like my guts are just uneasy and I’m hyper aware they exist lol. If anyone is questioning their decision to be sober, you can do it and should! Our society normalizes alcoholism for virtually any excuse or reason. Being sober can be beautiful. I feel slowly my temper and general outlook on things is leveling out.

It took so much self-control to wait even an hour after buying a bottle and then I had to pace myself so that I wouldn't run out and I could be maximum drunk before sleeping.  I hid how much I drank.  I woke up and drank to put-off the hangover.  

Not fun.  Not relaxing.  I used alcohol to cope with tedious social situations.  I thought nobody would want to talk to me if I was sober.  Alcohol made me a ""fun guy"".  I used alcohol to isolate myself when I didn't trust anyone.  They don't deserve to know my best self.  I used alcohol to tame the intense emotion of seeing old friends.  Alcohol only made it worse.  It turned all of my emotions into shame and I couldn't deal with the possibility of being happy or self-satisfied.

Stopping the slide so quick meant that I bypassed terrible physical side affects that have come with quitting in the past. I used to beat myself up, get depressed, and go into denial after every relapse which would lead me to drink more. Not this time! Everyone is vulnerable to mistakes. My encouragement is that you can minimize your mistakes and get back to succeeding! If you make a mistake, don’t use it as an excuse to keep failing.

She said she’s proud of me, and that she had quit for a while, but things have been so stressful lately (for everyone) and she slipped. Then she said what I used to say to myself all the time “the ultimate goal is to be able to drink in moderation “. I did like it when I drank in moderation in some ways. I liked that I didn’t get sloppy and embarrass myself, or get a hangover. I liked that proud feeling at the end of the night when I’d only had one or two. But I didn’t really enjoy myself when I drank like that. It took so much mental energy to tell myself how long I had to wait until my next sip, or until my next drink. I was constantly looking at the clock, and tracking how fast other people were drinking to make sure I wasn’t drinking faster. When I reached the limit I set for myself I would spend the rest of the night twitchy and looking for excuses to break my promise to myself, then fighting that urge, then getting another craving. Drinking was all I would think about, not the friends or activities we were supposed to be enjoying together. Maybe there are people who genuinely enjoy drinking in moderation, but I was never one of them. Even though the fact that I did drink in moderation sometimes made me think that it was something I could maintain (nope, I never maintained it long term) it was miserable. So why would that be my “ultimate goal” anymore? I’m so much more present with friends since I’m sober because I’m not wasting my energy thinking about how much, or how fast I can drink, or who’s judging me for it. This was a kind of aha moment for me, so I wanted to share in case it was something anyone else needed to hear. Sorry I’m so wordy! IWNDWYT",100,0

So the pandemic has really helped me to lead pretty much a sober life. In that time, I've had one gathering with a small group of friends and, typical to form; I drank way too much, did some things I'm not proud of and pushed those friends away.

I've been talking to a friend who's similar to me i.e. once he starts drinking, he can't stop. I've told myself for the past five weeks that I need to make a change and to make that change, I've got to stop drinking because I can't control how much I drink when I do, and it leads to regrettable situations and decisions. I think I've lost a lot of progress in my life due to this.

But my friend is trying to moderate. And now I think I'd be able to as well. He's not pushing me or influencing me in any way but I can hear an internal voice. A voice quietly telling me that I might be able to have a beer or two and stop. 

Any tips on getting out of this? I've tried reminding myself of the reasons for stopping but I'm now reading articles online for tips on moderating and I know what direction this is heading in.",5,1

She had been sober for 2 yrs and started becoming very stressed bc she had to take care of her brother who was sick. She wanted to relax in the evening and started with a few glasses  of booze to help her sleep. Soon she was up to a bottle of vodka a day (I think she said a fifth or something. Idk, I was a wine drinker). Soon she ran out of money and mouthwash is cheaper so she drank mouthwash. She relates that mouthwash is 12% alcohol and vodka is more (I don’t know about that either) and so she seized anyway. She was found down in her own feces and urine. She doesn’t know how it escalated so quickly (we are talking maybe a few weeks).

She was so ashamed. I sat with her and told her there is hope. That many of us suffer with this burden and that we are from all walks of life- from every age group, from every socioeconomic status, we are men/women/teens, we are mothers/fathers. We are here and each day we don’t take a drink is a victory, even when we fall hard. I talked to her about what I learned regarding the changes in our brain chemistry. I talked to her about how the anxiety worsens and the sense of relaxation is false. We prayed together. I talked about Annie Grace. In the end, she plans on letting her brother (who had resources) hire a nurse. Her story moved me. I hope I was able to help her.",8,0

It is a small accomplishment, but an accomplishment none the less. Before we even arrived copious amount of alcohol were packed that were being saved for the trip. I even ran into a store and bought a bottle of wine for my mom with no desire to pick anything up for myself. 


I was able to do this because before the trip even started I told myself I wasnt going to drink and it wasnt going to be a big deal. I had plans of just leaving when my family would inevitably get annoying because they were all drinking. Having a strategy in place helped immensely 


Every morning, I went through a mental list of what I was grateful for and listed reasons I did not want to drink. No hangover. Better sleep. More motivation. I will remember the whole trip. I've also been happier. I also continued to start my day by reading the 30 Day Alcohol Experiment. 


I'm still being alcohol free one day at a time. I am doing a 30 day challenge right now and when I hit that goal I will expand it to 100 days.

Couple #2 doesn't drink, but my husband and Couple #3 do. So I'll say right off the bat, having two other sober people there was a gigantic help. 

We got there right around 5pm on Friday and immediately the wine and White Claws were brought out. I haven't had any issues being around alcohol for a long time, but this time was different. It was a new situation for me. My cravings hit almost immediately and with them came a little bit of anxiety. Had this been a year ago, I would have absolutely loved this. A perfect excuse of a stay-cation to get absolutely blasted. Thankfully, within an hour or two of arriving, all those cravings passed. 

By the end of the weekend, I had accomplished the following feats, all because I was sober: an early morning, 6-mile hike up a mountain because I wasn't hungover; coherently taught two new board games to everyone; sober karaoke and Just Dance; I didn't fall asleep during our two movie nights because I wasn't drunk; absolutely zero shame and guilt caused by my out of control drunken behavior. 

To top it off, on the 2nd (and last) night there I got a random message from someone on social media who I don't even know, who thanked me for my honesty online about my sobriety and told me that he was now a couple months into his sober journey and he thought about my post often. I had made a ""coming out"" post of sorts on social media a while back, showing off my progress as a sober person.

So a little over 2 weeks ago. For someone who was sinking maybe 4 or 5 bottles of wine a week since lockdown started, that's pretty good. That's two whole weekends without caving into the voice that romanticises a glass of wine. 

Life feels weird at the moment, today in particular. Two of my colleagues have gone off sick with stress, and I could feel yesterday that I was starting to struggle with my own mental health. I hit a wall yesterday afternoon and spent some time this morning crying before going out for a walk to try and feel better. I think in the past, I would have either still had alcohol in my system which would have made it difficult to recognise that my own mental health was starting to falter, and I would have definitely drank tonight or this weekend to try and shut off the negative thoughts I am having. 

I think I need to find some kind of outlet to deal with how I am feeling right now. Any suggestions SD? IWNDWYT",2,1

I posted a few days ago about a pretty bad blackout I had at the weekend after having friends over for lunch. It highlighted a pattern of blackouts over a few years now and made it clear to me that this is only going to get worse unless I cut out alcohol indefinitely.

On Tuesday I met with a few friends and ended up having a glass of prosecco with them. I'm trying not to be angry at myself and instead to see it as something I need to learn from. It was an impromtpu meeting, I didn't expect there to be alcohol, I felt put on the spot and couldn't find a way of saying no without notice, suddenly there was a glass in front of me and I just went with it. 

I think this is part of my problem with alcohol. I honestly don't enjoy the taste or crave it or anything. I just struggle with having boundaries in general, poor self-esteem I guess, and in these situations I just go in innocently thinking I can have a glass of something like everyone else and be a normal responsible human. And then it's 50/50 as to whether that will happen, or I'll wake up 12 hours later with no idea of how I got home or what I did. 

So I'd love to learn about how other people got used to handling these social situations and protecting your sobriety. Do you tell people outright when they offer you alcohol? Or play it down and just discreetly opt for water / non alcoholic beer instead?",2,0

Today, I went to the lake with a couple friends. This always means: BOOZE UP, SHIRTS OFF, YEE-HAW! My friends even brought my favorite liquor EVER (a delicious espresso bean rum); however, I filled them in on my decision to cease drinking and didn't cave. 

Each morning I am greeted with greater energy. My anxiety and internalized shame is lessening. It seems I'm returning to myself, slowly, but surely.

Alcohol has dimmed the magnificent light of my soul these past few years. I'm stepping back out.

I'm so so so lucky to have gotten a bed because capacity is tiny because of social distancing. I was ecstatic when I got the call today confirming my spot after waiting for what felt like forever (I don't know how long, maybe 10 days or more; I lose all reasonable sense of time when I'm drinking). I got a preliminary call yesterday so in hopeful anticipation I didn't drink starting this morning and I have just been shaking and pacing and sweating like I'm running a race. I guess the detox segment will help with that.

Anyway, the main reason I am posting is because I am freaking out about how to prepare, what to pack, what to expect. (I have been medically detoxed before many times, but not this). They gave me a list over the phone which was basically just a dress code and a ban on electronics.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

If that's you too, lurking and wondering if change is possible, my experience has been that the days add up faster than I expected, just taking it one day at a time.

Let's keep this part short. Life isn't great for me right now. All the overall life changes courtesy of COVID, court/parenting time issues with ex, gma with terminal cancer, then losing my dad (only 52) to the virus two weeks ago, this would've been the perfect time for old me to get lost in some rum. On top of existential what-am-I-doing-with-my-life thoughts and guilty-because-how-can-I-feel-so-bad-when-so-many-people-have-it-worse feelings, it's a good thing I'm in therapy.

But that's just life. So many things are beyond our control. And work and school and kids and chores still need to get done among deaths and pandemics and riots. Some days I roll with the waves. Some days I'm sobbing in a corner under the unbearable weight of it all. But guess where I'm not? Praying to the porcelain princess each morning, blacked out on the floor every night, or sitting in the back of a cop car when things go too far. No matter how hard life gets, I'm grateful I've chosen to live without booze. That's one difficulty I can choose to give up.

We don't get a special chip celebrating our success unless we go out and earn one. I've never been to AA (not opposed, just limited availability working full time with a family), but I think fondly of milestone moments as a reminder of the progress I've made in my life just by not drinking. I can primarily thank this sub for my early sobriety, giving me a safe space to share and learn and build my own boozeless toolkit. I can thank myself for continuing the commitment to not drink, one day at a time.

So how about it, folks? In this crazy world where nothing's promised, let's take a moment to be thankful for the little and not-so-little things in our lives. Thanks for being part of my digital family on my 1500th day without booze. IWNDWYT",168,3

Thankful for that, as I still have a job, but what I now lack is social interaction that I used to get from work. You see I have moved quite a few times and I have always been ok with it. I live by myself have plenty of hobbies and I have found that being away from family and friends has never bothered me, but without going to the store I miss that social interaction and that has me wanting a drink. Because that was what I used to fill the void when I first moved away from everyone. Get home from work, drink; have a weekend by myself, drink; any free time at all, drink. There used to be a pattern and I have done well to break that pattern, but recent stress of work and just not liking managing people virtually has my brain telling me I need a drink. I know I won't do it, because I have too much pride to go back down that path and I know where it will leave me, but my brain is still telling me.

For the last 5 years I have objectively drinking A LOT of alcohol everyday.  About 750ml a night of vodka.  I can remember of a few nights in that time I wasn't drinking. But I never had a hangover and could keep up with my job.  Honestly always felt great.  It was my favorite way to entertain myself and just pleasantly not deal.  

I didn't lose relationships but I did notice I was not wanting to go out so I could drink at home.  I lost my insurance in Jan of this year and only recently got insurance after marrying a wonderful man.  My new GP identified a previous physician had prescribed me a dangerous amount of 2 BP meds, and blood work revealed I had extremely high liver enzymes, cholesterol, and now diabetes.

So I quit 4 days ago and switched to water.  I'm keeping a few tiny bottles of vodka in my outside freezer in case I get life threatening withdrawal symptoms but I'm already on a powerful anticonvulsant so hopefully not.  I have to keep it out there so I dont see them very often.  Its been a mixed bag so far.  I miss the pleasant fuzziness but liver failure is no joke and it's not just about my health but having a long happy life with my husband and not widowing him because of my poor choices.   I have a liver ultrasound in a week and I'm terrified I've passed irritation of my liver into cirrhosis.  It can happen so, so quietly apparently.

Really got triggered today.  I'd normally start drinking at this time to escape and let my emotions simmer down.   Can't so that anymore.  Can't binge eat whatever I want either.

I'm in that bottleneck but I'm determined to get through.  I can't imagine a deeper depth of hating myself falling off into the abyss again knowing what it will do to him and myself. Really inspired by all the posts on here and will be looking at it frequently to remind myself why I'm doing this when I feel weak.

-No hangovers
-More energy
-Better skin. WAY better without booze. Then I added a skin care routine to help it along.
-Less bloat
-Healthier food choices
-Saved a ton of money. Already paid off one small loan and added money to savings while still splurging occasionally. I thought I was spending about $200 / month on booze but that must've been a very modest estimate.
-My house is clean, and when it's not, it takes less than an hour to tidy up. 
-My memory and comprehension have improved
-Mental health is better. Way less anxiety and depression, and when I am anxious or depressed I can manage it more easily. (Working through trauma so this is to be expected.)
-I read more
-I cook more
-Spend more quality time with loved ones
-I spend a lot less time thinking about not drinking than I imagined I would. I used to think about drinking a lot. A lot a lot. 
-I can ALWAYS drive. 
-My body is less sore/stiff/achy

My husband is an angel and has stood by me through the worst of my alcoholic tendencies throughout the last decade. I know my drinking is a problem, so does he.. but I have “control” right now. I’m not blacking out, not wetting the bed (lowest of my low), but still drink daily. 
He asked last night when I thought I would be ready to give up “what’s in the freezer”.. he couldn’t even say the whiskey. I’m not a mean drunk, I’m not a sad drunk. I’m just a drunk. 

I take care of the baby. Go to work. Cook dinner (most nights) and all of this justified my drinking to me. “I’m not an alcoholic because I still manage to get everything done!” I am an alcoholic because I can’t go a single day without a drink. 

I’ve followed this sub for the better part of a year, finally made my own account about two months ago so I could read all the wonderful support every day. I typed up my own story and it’s saved in a draft. But when I finally decided to post I couldn’t even use the account that I made for literally this sub. I’m ashamed. I’m only 25. I wish I would have stopped before I started. My mom was (is) an alcoholic, why did I think I would be different?

Yesterday I made a post about it being my last chance in many ways from marriage to health to finances. I had a long heart to heart conversation with myself and decided to look at life without alcohol in that time and going forward. I involved my wife eventually at one point and spoke to her about everything and I told her in this all, only I can support myself truly to be better which is the truth if a person wants to change. Any additional support does not hurt though it will only aid with the process to become smoother and more educated. I appreciate this group a lot! 

The wife and I came up with a plan to get our mutual finances back on track due to my wrongdoings with alcohol. I even asked the bank to take me off as the main account holder and she only has control of it so I can only deposit money there and thankfully not withdraw any from it (it will help with any temptations to buy any more liquor poison with money I shouldn’t use for that or escaping from home if any disagreements arise). Alcohol numbs you for a short time but the long term effects are way worse! 

I’m making steps forward in being a mature 31 year old and getting my life sorted out ONE step at a time. It’s going great and I will enjoy my Chipotle burrito today for lunch! 

Keep your heads up, it’s only day 3 and still have a long way to go but I feel so much better already on day 3. Positivity and happiness lead to more greatness and well being than drowning inside of a bottle no matter even if it’s a 4 ounce taster of beer at the brewery or even a sip!",6,0

I used to go on binges for weeks or even months, drinking all day, even if I had to go to work.  I would drink 3 or 4 beers or shots before going in and I was always fine.  Hell, on longer shifts sometimes I would have a few minis in my pocket.  Eventually the anxiety would catch up with me and I'd have panic attacks when there wasn't enough alcohol in my system.  I would realize that I needed to lay off and I'd suffer through the anxiety and night sweats for a few days, which I now know was alcohol withdrawal.  I'd stay sober for a few weeks, maybe a month, and then something would always start it all over again.  One drink became a drunken evening, that led to drinking the next morning, that lead to drinking all week or longer.

The end of my last big bender was very scary.  I don't even really remember my first sober day, just laid in bed groaning all day, almost like when you have a bad fever, but more unpleasant.  The next few days were filled with horrible anxiety, suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, shaking, physical pains, night sweats for days, just absolutely terrible.  I am so lucky that I didn't have any seizures and it wasn't smart of me to stop cold turkey without medical supervision.  Thank God I had a few Xanax to help me through that awful week.  I was also having pains near my liver, not super bad but a dull ache, it's much better now but not completely gone.  I've been taking milk thistle, turmeric, fish oil, magnesium, and NAC, along with my other vitamins.

So far everything has been a million times better.  My headspace, my outlook, physically, emotionally, just everything.  It's still crazy for me to know that I'm not a drinker anymore, I don't drink, sounds so weird!  This isn't just one of my breaks, this isn't just because I was feeling like shit for a hot minute, I do not drink anymore because it is literally poison and it was literally killing me... Oh and ruining my life.

I've got a clear head for the first time in a decade really.  I am making plans for my future, I want to go back to school, I want to figure out my life.  I think that was the main reason why I drank so much.  I never finished college and I've always felt like a loser, bartending ever since and just having no self esteem or self worth.  Drinking made the pain feel better, but it has still left me in the same place and has taken so much time, money, and life away from me.

I wore my addiction like a personality trait.  I guess that leads back to the low self esteem.  Alcohol made me feel cool and edgy.  Now I look back on it and I feel that so many people just view me as an alcoholic.  Not many people ever saw me get super sloppy, I saved that for home, but still, alcoholism isn't glamorous like it wants us to believe.  I am looking forward to finding my true self now.

Thanks to whoever reads this, it needed to be written.  I got tempted really bad the other day at the grocery store.  Just seeing a box of craft beer lit up some kind of neural pathway and it really got to me.  I just wanted that release, I wanted that nothingness to wash over me.  Even the next day I was still kind of bummed and mopey.  But today is a new day and I feel fine again.  I needed to get this out, to share, and to remind myself of what one drink can do to me.  Hopefully it will help someone else too.

Drinking for me meant chasing a feeling/experience over and over again. Upon further research, I discovered this article (below) that explains how addiction is a two-part process. Not only does the brain seek pleasure but at some point, it wishes to avoid pain as well. Over time the want to avoid pain overcomes the want to seek pleasure and at that point, the addictive experience/chemical is now necessary to avoid pain. The addiction itself becomes the source of pain, basically creating a new additional problem.

Yesterday, I mowed the lawn. That was the first time I mowed the lawn sober, without a beer in my hand or in the cupholder (riding lawn mower). I did something stupid while mowing near a ditch and rolled the lawnmower. Not too big a deal, but it did scare me. I got a small scrape, nothing much. Rolled the lawnmower back, finished up, and parked it.

Later in the evening, I realized how scared I actually was, and I had two glasses of wine. I couldn't sleep properly all night, I kept getting flashbacks of the moment I lost control of the lawnmower, thinking about how much worse it could have been, thinking about all the times I drove the mower with three or more beers in me, then thinking about all the times I went driving with more than that in my system.

Friday night my coworkers got too drunk and got into arguments. I wasn’t a part of that, luckily, a few months ago I would have been. Saturday night was a shit show. Drunk people everywhere.

Drunk bachelor parties, a drunk older woman was being rude to me and her date and got left by the date. We even had our first drink walking around without a mask and got to kick her out. The entire night was a display of what I left behind, being a drunk asshole. 

I spent my two days off working on myself, my house and going for a hike. My days off weren’t spent drinking in a bar or hungover.

Today I did my first run of the year. Managed to get a 4k done and feeling good about it. Looking forward to getting to 5k, improving my time and getting even more active. Thinking of taking up boxing training once a week too.

Anyway just checking in. Do have some cravings today but going to fight through it. Hope you, who ever it is reading this is doing well and taking positive steps forward.

Much love

Felt great, finally got contacts, dropped 15 lbs, I'm ready to keep improving. This involves getting braces because my current teeth are jacked up! They are misaligned, overlapping, I have a huge gap on one side, and crowded. I've never smiled wide and I want to smile and be proud, dammit. I am 30 years old, btw.

Anyways, I got spacers on this Monday to prepare me for my braces next Monday. And WHOA. They hurt, bad. Tylenol is not even touching the pain these have brought. It's like a vice grip has been placed on my entire mouth, I can't chew without a shooting pain through my jaw whenever my teeth touch, and my mouth just pulses with pain when I'm sitting still. I'm on my third day of intense pain and I'm ready for rum, White Claw, hard cider, vodka, anything. Give me sweet release, I beg you, oh mighty Teeth Gods.

Thankfully I have a partner who has been doting on me, and makes me feel warm and cozy. But one of the spacers fell out, I have to go back in today and get it replaced, and I have such a feeling of dread and anguish that I want to rush home and get drunk the moment I finish at my orthodontist appt today.

However, in my attempt to keep my daily streak count going, I will be going home, popping tylenol, and watching mindless TV on the couch.

I've stopped so many times, and I'd say fairly easily. When I need to hike, or drive, or scuba dive, or do anything responsible, I can go on for weeks, without really missing it. I know it doesn't mix with what I like to do, and that's my only solace I guess.  And yet, there's a trigger that gets me back. Or perhaps the lack of excitement, and the mundane of daily life. Pandemic-lock-down didn't help, though according to my notes, it didn't make things much worse either.

Drawing/Digital art
       



This is something I’ve always done, but doing it sober is better. When I drew whilst drunk my work always looked rushed and sloppy. Now also I’ve started to do digital art which is better since I get the edits printed easier too. 



Conversations
         



Ever realize how fun talking to others in person is? Just a well thought out and enlightening conversation with another person is really enjoyable. And not being drunk for it is even better. You can remember everything and contribute in a intelligent way.





- Movies 
          




Really watching a movie alone can be a excellent experience. Really taking it in and seeing it for what it’s worth. I’ve been discovering a lot of new movies and studios I didn’t even know about.




bird watching 
          


I flat out love birds, there’s no getting around it. I got a nice feeder set up in my backyard, so it’s a great spot to observe. Being able to get up early not hungover is a huge plus for watching those early morning birds

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

The struggle which evil necessitates

is one of it’s greatest blessings.

It makes us strong, patient, 

helpful men and women. 

It lets us into the soul of things 

and teaches us that although 

the world is full of suffering, 

it is also full of the overcoming of it.

I didn't like the way life was going, and I wanted to escape. And in a way the answer was the same for why I quit. There was no major event for me to make either change. The start may have been sparked by an unhappy ending to a relationship, but drinking nights weren't frequent at first. I thought they were a fun way to connect and that's what adult fun was like. 


The frequency picked up over time and at some point I realized I wasn't the man I had a chance to be. Connections weren't real, and everybody was just acting petulant. Overweight child-minded men, and a few anorexic women who chose between drinking days and eating days were staring at me from my future. I stood with the best of them, chest to chest with them. You can take the rest of them if you stare the first one down. 

No major event needed to make a change for the better, just a moment of reflection and some true self confidence, preferably without a drug propping it up.",11,0

Early 30s, relatively healthy, just a number of unfortunate events in my life resulting in addiction to alcohol to fall asleep. I've had this habit last during the 2008 recession. When life improved, the addiction wore off. Sometimes it can be as bad as a combination of drugs like cough syrup, trazodone, diphenhydramine and other sedatives...but nothing works better than alcohol.

So my learnings as to how I managed going 365 days: I am 65 and  have been drinking some 50 years. In retrospect, I had a problem by the age of 25 but it wasn't noticeable at the time since everyone within my work and social orbit was drinking jut as much. A lot was down to youthful adventurism but a major part was self medicating to avoid facing the reality that I was doing a job I did not like in a political environment I detested. In time, the work improved with many international moves and progressive promotions. I became what can be called a high functioning alcohol addict . ( I now avoid the judgemental term' alcoholic since using that term makes it difficult for us drinkers to admit to being one. I will gladly admit to being an alcohol addict).

 You could call me successful and I was on an economic plane. However,  I have learned in the last year that alcohol robbed me of self confidence and replaced it with chronic anxiety. It also gave me high blood pressure along the way and I have no doubt damaged my heart. Just to complete the picture, I have had cancer twice. If the alcohol was not the direct cause, it certainly did not help matters. Every so often, usually after heavy binges, I would swear off drininking.  I managed a few periods of a month or more but I could probably count the times on one hand, in 50 years!  At some stage, responsible drinking and alcohol units started to gain some recognition-leading to (drinker's) ridicule of course-at one stage I remember saying that it was hardly worth drinking if you were limited to 14 units for a male.  Again, a drinker's logic! Nonetheless, I was becoming aware that alcohol was definitely not having a good effect on my physical and mental health.  Although I wanted to give up drinking, I was terrified, yes terrified, at no longer being able to drink, especially at social gatherings.

Eventually, I just got sick of drinking.  Everything seemed to involve alcohol-business travel-free alcohol! BBQ's without a beer-are you kidding? Well its Friday! or 5pm! or there's a game on! or we have people over! or we're going on holiday! and so on and so on.  I had  read a few books on giving up over the years but nothing seemed to work.  Eventually, I came accross 'This Naked Mind' by Annie Grace. this book worked for me.  I stopped drinking when I started to read the book and have never started again.  The book worked for me because it successfully changed my belief system about alcohol.  As the book says, when you make a rational decision to stop drinking, the subconcious mind 'doesn't get the memo!'  Think of your subconcious mind as that little voice in your head or whispering into your ear to have that drink. This book managed to help me silence this voice. I recommend it, you can download it as well as hard copy.  The journey this year has been much easier than previous attempts which relied on what I call 'white nuckling'-trying to igore 'cravings'.  i didnt really feel 'cravings ' initially, just overwhelming relief that 'it was over'.  I do get occasional periods when it seems like a good idea to have a drink-but I can view this as mere conditioning of the mind and an automatic reaction to the triggering event or environment-think a sunny day overlooking the sea, or cooking on the BBQ.  I now have new alcohol free memories from the same occasions and environments. I no longer  automatically reach for a drink in response to a trigger.  I also firmly belief that you have to genuinely want to stop drinking to be succesful with the techniques in the book.  I re-read several chapetrs and paragraphs to get full comprehension. This forum has been a great support.  I somehow imagine it as bit of a liferaft-some of us are in it, some of us are hanging on to the sides and some of us are swimming towards it. Everyone is lending a helping hand at each stage of the journey.  The forum keeps the raft inflated. 

Although a long post, it is in fact a gallop through my struggle-but I'm sure you get the message. Give it a go, kep trying because the rewards both mental and physical are fabulous. You will ,in short, become joyful.",238,0

""Nothing changes if nothing changes.""

I had almost 3 years sober back at the end of 2019. And then I had a string of bad shit happen to me, which I stayed sober through, but several months later, I figured ""what's one beer?"" 

Then COVID happened, which is definitely not an uncommon story recently, and literally... nothing changed. I checked myself into detox in May because I knew I couldn't stop on my own. And I was sober for about a month, but I literally changed nothing. Being at home all the time, aside from the occasional grocery store trip, is really hard to change. My drinking friends are my cats, and my bar is my living room. 

I know very well I shouldn't be drinking. But god, the boredom and monotony of the past 4 months has been unbearable. I'm not really asking for advice on how to stop, I know damn well how to stop. It's staying stopped that's the issue. Everything I do at home I did while drinking, and it feels off to do it otherwise. The anxiety is just awful. My sleep is so messed up.

I’m still not sure I’ve let myself process everything that I was only semi-present for in the past decade (heartbreak, loss, financial ruin, etc) but I think I’m better off than I was a year ago.

Thanks for posting and responding today. It's good to not be alone as usual.

On paper things are going well on this fifth day I'm on. I've been working out and sleeping better. Opening my head up to new ideas for my personal growth and my future aswell as getting focused on my work. I'm an artist you see. But even though things seem well. Something feels off.

This fifth day. The last time I was here I caved. I'm having a similar experience this time around prior to ruining it with a drink. I believe it is partly this realisation that I'm having that I wasn't sad that I was drinking I was actually drinking because I was sad.

I'm using the word sad loosely here. It's more a mixture of emotions and feelings which I think I need to address rather than numbing them with substances.

Another thought that is lurking that was there last day 5. Is the fun I had whilst drinking. I miss my friends already. I miss the music. I'm finding it hard to picture being happy without a life that involves drinking. It's weird because you sacrifice a whole lot of happiness for a flash of good times. Followed by all the negatives of drinking. Now I'm left without that flash of happiness and just this feeling of a life that is so mediocre. I know it's up to me to change that.

Anyway I felt like writing a poem today...

Day five day five, on this fifth day,
Five sips are only just five clicks away,
On the fifth we shall say
I will not drink with you today,

As dark as it seems,
Blurred without dreams,
Words without screams,
Five times redeemed,

The black mirrored reflection,
Of self portrayed rejection,
Of negative interception,
My 5 days sober are my helm, visa and protection,

Time heals all pain,
Keep it moving like a windmill blade,
Grow your own green grass on the other side of the window frame,
On this fifth day,
We shall say,
no not today,

I will not drink with you.",1,0

It’s hard to describe the hole, but I think it’s a perpetual feeling of being unsatisfied and unfulfilled. I used alcohol and romantic relationships to temporary fill the hole, but as you can imagine, it was a toxic combination. I’m now sober and recently split with my girlfriend, so I’m feeling especially empty now. 

With my new free time, I’ve focused on my health and being productive. I have some exciting things going on, but at the end of the day, I just sort of feel... empty - I think in some parts because I don’t have a partner to share these things with. For so long I would pass out on my couch or stumble to bed drunk, but now 11 or 12pm rolls around and I think, “well, guess I better go to bed and do this all again tomorrow.” with no one to say goodnight to or share the bed with.

Just really agitated and upset at myself for not turning my life around sooner. I have not being able to get my health or finances in line within the last 5-7 years because of one thing. Alcohol. It’s so bad peoples say it’s a lot for a DUI. Well knock on wood at had something me telling me take an Uber every time which I do but it’s to the point that over the last 6-10 years I have racked up literally $15k or more of debt due to drinking and needing to take Ubers for $120 at 1am to get home cause I’m far from home. Haven’t been able to pay bills on time cause I use this money for drinking plus the debt I mentioned. I’ve lost a job once cause of it. I also have my last chance at showing my wife I can do this. She said one more time, I’m packing and moving out. I did not go camping with her this past weekend cause I was so hungover I went straight to drinking the next day and decided to keep sucking the poison rather than Ubering home and at least spending time with her and my dog. I’m selfish and disrespectful cause of alcohol. I’ve been VERY CLOSE to the edge of the bottom whatever it may be. I’ve been to the hospital a year ago from being so dehydrated after a 4 day binge, the day I was supposed to spend time with family for my dads dinner. That got ruined. I’ve also known that my health is not the best at 31 due to drinking. If I don’t stop now I will lose many things in life and I’m scared. Drinking has done NOTHING for me except ruin my health, my marriage, my finances, my job status, my ability to be better. I’m someone that binges for 3-7 days and then stops and starts and I only have beer but still poison. I hope the stop sign is so far up my ass right now that I don’t even think about having another sip. Thank you for everyone’s support and anyone’s input on how they got through this will help. My therapist tells me to accept it.... well I can not anymore and I’m a person that can’t just have one so I simply can not drink. Please any support will be great. Thank you again.

It seems according to the people who answered almost impossible or at least very risky and ""not worth that risk"". Thanks for your answers.

This is my second post, I suppose I’m starting to realise I’m in a crossroad and I will have to make a choice between alcohol or enjoying life otherwise with my family but not only. So please bear with me even if my questions seem silly to you, they’re still the questions that come to mind at this stage for me.

I'm not trying to find answers that suit me, I'm more interested in having your feedback so to have the full spectrum of experiences and know what I may expect, that's all.

Here it is:

&#x200B;

1. **Did you stop overnight or did you stopped gradually ?**

I already had convulsions (related to a fight which was related to alcohol), I really don’t wan’t to live that again so I’m inclined to reduce gradually but I don’t know if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

2. **How many times have you relapsed before making your first anniversary ?**

I’m starting to be really motivated, but I have the feeling this is a long process where I may behave kind of bipolar and I will probably feel different tomorrow or even tonight

&#x200B;

3. **For those who felt a diminution in language capabilities and have memory issues, do they get back ?**

I have lost almost all my short term memory, if I don’t make a huge effort to remember something it’ll get lost and people around me got used to repeat the same information again and again. No need to say this don’t work well at work. I also black out really easily when drinking. Furthermore, I feel I can’t speak correctly, finding my words is sometimes really difficult, I have a hard time formulating an idea. Strange thing, it gets really easier when I drink (this has been confirmed many times by my wife)

&#x200B;

4. **Sleep**

How long did you get to be able to sleep without taking any medications ?

   5. And last question for today, this one is a bit superfluous but did you lose weight or did you compensate with, I don’t know… food ?

Have a great day

But nope-my husbands family just announced to us that our California trip that was mainly going to be about visiting relatives has now turned into a week long winery crawl to maintain social distancing (Thanks COVID). Obviously my husband knows the worst of my journey with alcohol-but only about half of his family knows my true commitment to sobriety. 

I was already gearing up for this trip being a challenge-time away from real life, that temptation to sneak into the mini bar, resisting the urge to let myself have a few because “it’s a vacation so it doesn’t count”. But adding the element of wineries just gave me a pit in my stomach.

I’m reaching out to this group for help and support. You guys have ALWAYS been there-and even though my husband and family are supportive, you are the only ones who really know what it’s like to deal with this addiction. 

I don’t want to be the fun sucker by having to announce to everyone that I won’t be participating because I’m sober-maybe that’s a lie I’m just telling myself but I feel like it will just make things awkward. But I also want to be strong-any words of encouragement, reminders that I don’t need the booze to have a good time, and things that you tell yourselves when you’re in the thick of the worst temptations would be SO helpful.

Even during my IOP sessions, we talk about surrendering and character defects and a lot of the stuff from the 1935 edition of the big book, which clearly are not applicable to most of society today, especially women.

I (21/f) have been trying to get sober for the past year now. Long story short Alcohol has caused me a lot of trouble over the past few years.

And have been day drinking and I binge on some days. I’m really tired of trying to do this on my own and my sponsor recommended going to rehab for me. I decided to let my parents in on this decision and let them know what was going on.

One year, 7 months, one week, and 5 days ago my entire life began crashing down around me. December 14, 2018

During the 8 months prior to that I was making progress on giving up alcohol completely, but it was for the wrong reasons. I was only quitting drinking to please my controlling spouse. He was abusive and controlled every other aspect of my life; so I used alcohol as a way to cope through the abuse. I remember the last time I got drunk on Memorial Day weekend 2018 and I posted saying it was “revenge drinking” when really it was just me trying to convince myself that he couldn’t control me for a day. 

Fast forward the to night of December 14. My dad passed away unexpectedly from a heart attack. He was one of my main sources of support through the abuse I was experiencing. I talked to him at least 5 days a week. I had talked to him a few hours before that and we joked about a cat I used to have. I still did not drink. I bought plane tickets for my sister and I to fly back to our home state early the next morning. 

After getting to my parents house the next day, I still did not drink. Unfortunately we all became ill with the norovirus. My (now ex) husband finally came up for the funeral and made my life extremely difficult because I wouldn’t pay enough attention to him. And still I stayed sober. We went to my dads favorite bar where they dedicated a plaque for him and I still stayed sober. I was completely void of all emotions, causing my (ex) husband to lash out at me even more. 

The day of my dads funeral was difficult because I wanted to be with my mom and sisters and not my demanding ex. And that night I finally broke. I had a drink. I did not get drunk. It was one drink. But I was so scared he would lash out at me for drinking that I avoided him more. Luckily he flew home the next day. And I stayed sober. 

Then my sister, my best friend, the person who moved her family over 2,000 miles to be closer to me dropped a bombshell on me. On the previous 4th of July weekend when she was drunk and I left her at my house while I ran an errand, my ex sexually assaulted her. That was the final straw for my marriage. I could put up with him abusing me, but hurting people close to me was too far. 

I flew home a few days later and he picked me up at the airport. I couldn’t even stand to look at him. I just wanted to get a bottle and drown in it. But I knew I would be stuck if I did, so I didn’t drink. The next couple days I found and apartment and moved out. 

Over the next 6 months I started to come out of the cloud I had been under and I realized that I didn’t want to drink anymore.  I didn’t need to numb out my emotions because there wasn’t a fear of reprisal from him. It took me a little over a year from when I left to finally file for divorce. I didn’t want to hurt his kids that I had helped raise for over 15 years. I finally had to tell myself that they would be ok because they are older and they are smart enough to have seen what was going on for all those years. 

The tldr; I just want everyone on the sub to know that no matter how bad things get, it is ok not to drink. And in my case, it was better not to drink so that I could escape and begin to heal.

I am on day 5 of no drinking and I think I had at least one drink every night for the last 2 weeks and haven't been able to go more then 2 days in a row without drinking for probably 4 months. So this morning I felt fine until I passed a normal bowl movement- but immediately felt like I was either dieing, having an ectopic pregnancy, or my appendix exploded. I could barely walk from horrific cramps for like 15 min. Then I pooped again and now feel like I'm on the mend. Has this happened to anyone else? I only had a little dry cereal this morning, water, and a bit of coffee but all of this is normal breakfast for me. I have been way more hydrated over the last few days drinking lots of seltzer and regular water so I was extra surprised to have so much trouble this morning.",2,0

The best thing I could have done for myself and my family . The only regret I have is that I didn’t quit years ago . 
The advice I would like from the community here is that I have a 24 year old daughter and she’s smart , fun and beautiful but she does drink and drug and smoke way more than is good for her especially with the history of addiction in our family and also in the light of my sobriety and seeing how much better life is sober , so how do I go about persuading her to give sobriety a try ???? (She is staying with us with her boyfriend for a couple of weeks )
I don’t want to come across as lecturing or self righteous as that would probably push  the wrong buttons . She has expressed a desire to quit smoking after her birthday on Saturday so that would  be a good time to quit alcohol for a month I have suggested. Her boyfriend is a smoker so that is going to make it harder for sure . 
I’m not against microdosing mushrooms and actually I think they can help with addiction and cold turkey symptoms

I noticed some things about drinking over the last 5ish years. I started noticing I feel like I am chasing a high that doesn’t really happen. Also, I don’t actually like having 1-2 drinks...because I just want more. I don’t want to want. I don’t like craving. It’s why I quit smoking. I hated being somewhere where there wasn’t smoking and I couldn’t have a cigarette but I wanted one. Then if I snuck away, I would wreak of it and I don’t like smelling. It’s embarrassing. With zero effort I quit smoking. If I would crave it, it was out of habit but I genuinely stopped liking it, and poof, done. 

It’s like that’s happened with drinking. It’s not actually fun. It was at one time but now, it’s just not. It’s overhyped on its abilities to help me escape. I still have anxiety and depression and it’s made worse by drinking. I wish I had a magic elixir that would help me check out, but alcohol isn’t it. Not even close. I thought it was the only fun I had left in the mundane life I lead. It’s not. Things are still fun without alcohol, maybe even more fun because I’m not craving and worrying if I’m too tipsy or smell like stale beer. It clicked. I don’t like alcohol. I don’t crave it, miss it, want it, or need it. There will be no fight: I’m just done ✅",69,0

I got a bad cold literally two days before and couldn’t go.
I also couldn’t go to the last dinner they had because I was sick.
I had my hours at work reduced to part time because I was always calling in sick, from mental health and alcohol related reasons. They reduced my hours, I maybe called in sick like 60+ times this year because of severe depression and anxiety, as well as a few hangovers. I also self isolated twice because I thought I had covid and got tested negative. 
They finally gave me full time back and I worked full time for 2 weeks before getting this bad cold.

When I get sick like this I have a cough for weeks.
So even though I only technically only lost 3 days of work I will have gone 5 days in a row not attending work. And when I return I will be taking cough syrup and praying they didn’t scale my hours back again.

We also now have 5 confirmed Covid cases in our town, about one a day starting with the first, not a large town. Both were bank workers.
Even though it isn’t covid, I couldn’t work Sunday because i would have scared away the customers.

Tomorrow I have a doctors appointment to ask for a PCOS screening and if they tell me I have to treat my cold as if it’s actually COVID and self isolate that means I’m fucked.
I’m scared to get fired for all the work I missed. I can’t help the anxiety or bipolar depression.
I couldn’t call in suicidal on those days I didn’t care if I got fired or not, I couldn’t call in with anxiety attacks or tell them I needed time to regroup.
I’m a cashier, it’s not a strenuous job the customers are just stupid assholes.

My mom told me to apply for disability on account of my mental health issues before I moved out of her house and now she tells me I can’t apply for that unless I get fired. It’s worst case scenario but at least I would have a bit of my own money if that happens.
She thinks I’m autistic but I don’t think so and I’m not diagnosed with that, the mental health system has more shitty therapists than good ones though a few have helped I’m not going back.

I hate my apartment, it’s shit, but I don’t want to lose my independence and have to move in with my mom. I’m going to be 23 years old soon.

I was trying to work and stay sober to save money for a laptop to produce music and save for a car too, I was going to find a better apartment building to live in. I was trying to quit drinking to lose weight but I’m still fat and I’m still having trouble trying to lose the weight. I’m almost 3 weeks sober and it’s hard now because what I did it for isn’t working out.

I still keep losing money, staying fat, and getting bad colds whenever I’m not depressed.
I’m always broke.
My plan was to learn to be a full musician and artist by the end of the year so I could start posting online my art and music to try build a following and eventually a career. I couldn’t do that.

My childhood dreams are probably ruined and I should accept it. The govt cut funding to anything I could have gone to school for.
My family sees me as someone with “limitations” aka thinks I’m autistic and has bipolar/anxiety and needs to be kept in check all the time.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Last week u/avatarfan2008 mentioned David Sheff's *Beautiful Boy*, which was a book I'd been considering for a very long time. It was available for Kindle checkout from my library so I got it. It was excellent and it was very, very hard to read. 

I don't talk about this much here or IRL, but I am the mother of an addict myself. Every single page of this book mirrored my own experiences in some way or other with the main differentiation being that my daughter started much, much younger than the kid in the book and that we were far less affluent than the author and his family. The main common denominator between myself and the author is feeling that, like Sheff, in spite of all the soothing and wise words of counselors, experts, authors, and well meaning friends and loved ones, deep down I've never been able to shake feeling like it's my fault. 

Some here at SD have said that this book showed them what it's like on the other side (it's been mentioned many times in the Tuesday convo). It showed them the pain they caused loved ones. I hope some of you who found yourselves addicts at a young age might try this book for that experience if that's something you're ready for at this stage of your recovery.  For me, it's the only ""side"" of things I know. When I became a drunk, I was over 40, an early empty-nester, and an early widow. My family were 2,000 miles away and I moved a few hundred miles away from my friends, not knowing it consciously at the time but now in hindsight I can see that it was so I could destroy myself in private. So my loved ones who were still alive and not strung out didn't really even notice my descent into addiction. At least I don't think so.

I may turn this into a Saturday Share at some point. It's all too painful to write out usually but reading this book has emboldened me somewhat. 

Besides being challenging reading for an addict and someone who loves an addict, it's just a damn fine piece of nonfiction prose. I'd definitely recommend it.

That's my reading life lately. And to end on a lighter note, we finally got a TV a month after moving here and our first Netflix was *Fire Saga*, which was not a good movie by most standards but was a breath of fresh air for me.

I did a little search and found a PDF copy online, read it myself and now I’m on day 4 with forever on the horizon! 

It goes into the psychology behind drinking and reminds me a lot of Allen Carr’s Easyway to quit smoking (which I highly recommend if you’re trying to quit) except for drinkers.

A lot of you have probably already read it or recommended it but I thought I’d share the link and encourage anyone who’s looking for helpful materials to go ahead and give it a read, you can start right this second.

I’m a binge drinker. I can stop drinking for weeks or months and then ease back into it. And I’m fine for a few months. Then I drink too much. Then I do it again. Then I do it again. Then my boyfriend is hurt and upset and can’t look at me because I was a mess. 

It was bad in February and I stopped drinking until May. I drank in moderation until the end of June when I got drunk. I was in control, but it rattled him. We talked about it, agreed I wouldn’t get drunk. Then I got drunk, but again stayed in control. He talked to me again telling me how anxious it was making him and how he was so scared I’d take it too far. And I did the next night. I was at a friend party and just did not stop drinking scotch. I got myself home before it all hit and then I was sloppy. I was loud and slurring and was an asshole. I made myself a drink, of course, and called a friend while he went to bed. Then I don’t know what happened. I ended up in our guest room bed. My glass was on the counter so I’m not sure if I put it there or if he found me drunk on the couch. 

I talked to a friend at work, a fellow social worker, and she was understanding but also told me I just made a mistake and that taking a break from drinking  again is a good idea. 

The most fucked up part is my sister is an alcoholic. She just relapsed again and almost died. Four relapses in four months. I’m so scared of turning into her. 

I’m so scared of putting my mom through this with me too. It’s killing her to see my sister like this. So why do I do it? I don’t want to binge. I just want to enjoy myself and relax. Why do I binge drink? 

I’ve realized I will always get to a point where I’m drinking all I can and I don’t want that. So I’ve decided I will not drink again. But I’m really scared about this. Because what if I fail? It sounds so childish but I’m really afraid of not being able to stop. And it doesn’t make sense because if I don’t stop I can’t fail at it. But I’m scared I won’t be able to do it. I’m afraid six months from now I’ll decide I’m okay and can handle it. 

I’m also terrified my relationship is over. The future seems bleak. I’m fortunate I don’t have the urge to drink at all right now. This happened Saturday night and I’ve been a giant ball of anxiety since then. But I’m scared for when this isn’t as acute. I just don’t want to fail. I don’t want to do this any more and I don’t want to hurt people around me. I know everyone wants that but I keep thinking it. 

I’m struggling and I’m afraid and I’m raw. Any advice, help, or insight anyone has would be so helpful and I’ll be so grateful.",12,0

After perusing this sub and a few different threads on r/AskReddit about people's most embarrassing / lowest point drinking, I've mustered up enough courage to share my own recent experience. And pivot towards control over my drinking habits. So here goes:

I'm no stranger to blacking out, it's rare and hasn't happened to the degree it did this past Saturday in a few years. The kind where I can't remember a solid 3-4 hours of the night. For context, I'm a 26 y/o 6'6"" 235 pound dude.

Anyway I was invited to a small gathering at my friend's place in a nearby state in New England and went up to spend the night with his friends and family friends. It's an annual cookout/ pool party thing. Upon arrival, I'm handed beer, several tequila shots, and hit the ground running hard. Told multiple times to 'catch up'. I haven't drank much at all this quarantine due to the fact I'm living with my parents and y'know, the pandemic..

Quickly everyone pivoted to drinking games which I remember, and then I began schmoozing with all the parents / older adults there at their indoor bar. This older guy, we'll call him John, is serving moonshine and I proceed to take at least 3-4 shots in quick succession because we were hitting it off and he was serving them up. As you may guess, big fucking mistake. Lights were on but no one was home after that for the rest of the night. I wake up disoriented in my tent, head pounding wondering how on Earth I changed from my swim suit to underwear.

I walk past the people who were already up, and greet them good morning, got grunts and ignored a bit in return. This one girl who had my back the whole time wakes up and comes to the pool where I'm desperately trying to come back to life. Apparently, but to absolutely no surprise, my dumbass caused a whole lot of drama. I was told I made a move on this gentleman John, got into his personal bubble, proceeded to be taken to the pool to 'sober up' (wasn't deep at all I could stand everywhere still not the best idea) where I thought it was a great idea to skinny dip all by myself. Others may have joined? Who knows. This older woman who is my friend's aunt and was close to being on my level of drunk decides she wants to help me sober up, and allegedly comes into the pool and jumps on my back, to the sheer horror of her daughter who sees this go down (I'm still butt ass naked). After that, I am corralled by my friend and two new 'friends' back to my tent and along the way I'm refusing to cover up with the towels they provided. My new 'friend' who gave me the tequila shots at the beginning was gracious enough to dress me, and at that point I still wanted to keep partying. My friend's dad had to come over and scold me into going to bed, which I finally did.

Made my rounds that morning and apologized to the parents and people I made uncomfortable. They weren't mad and told me no hard feelings, to not be too hard on myself. Which was nice to hear, but not enough to prevent the shame spiral I was sent on on the way home and still am grappling with. I definitely am cutting out hard liquor and eventually alcohol altogether. The shame that comes from acting out like this is honestly torture, and it's put me in a bad place mentally when I was doing so well too. Hard to be compassionate with myself when thinking about what happened makes me want to scream and then die. Feeling a bit better now but man am really reassessing my relationship with booze. Not worth it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR blacked out for the first time in years at a small family pool party, invaded people's personal space and skinny dipped on my own in front of my friend's fam and extended fam. Was scolded into  going to bed after I made it clear I wanted to keep partying. Been on a shame spiral that led me to deciding to at least give up liquor and put my drinking in check.",18,2

New Redditor.,"5-15 beers a day for about 6 months, down to zero. It’s been 8 days, the first 5 days were hell, sweating, rapid heart rate, but I’m at day number 8 after two trips to a&e. No physical withdrawals except mild nausea, maybe because I haven’t been eating as much as before.

I feel much better, the shakes and sweating has decreased and now only come in 15 minute periods a few times per day. Trying to get at least 15 minutes walking per day.

Problems right now are anxiety, which isn’t normal for me, I’ve always been super confident, but right now I just want to sit in a dark room and do nothing. Has anyone had troubles with dizziness? I’m getting a woozy lightheaded feeling every 10 minutes or so where I feel like I could fall over, but I don’t as I’m clinging on to handrails and stuff.

Can anyone remember when this dizziness went away for them? It seems to be the only thing seemingly wrong with me for now, along with the anxiety which I’m sure I can manage.

*Watch out for rebounding; you'll try to fill the boredom with something*

Oh yup, you bet man. I've been coding my balls off this week. Walking the shit out of my dog. Walked eight miles with a buddy over the weekend. Today, I even went running. Isn't all this some Real Progress. 

All last week, I've been up until 2 in the morning. Every. Single. Night. And this is an achievement, because it takes me 20mg of melatonin to get this far.  

I take meds for boredom, the restlessness, the energy -- ADHD and all that -- but I can't take them that late, no sir. Can't take them past 4. Even that's pushing it. 

*Don't stay on the pity pot, man. Gotta just accept it and keep moving forward.* 

Yeah, that's what I'm doing. That's what this is. This *is* me accepting it, because this shit sucks big hairy monkey nuts, and a part of me wants to pretend like it doesn't. Like I'm handling it all just fine. 

I am not fine. I'm actually pretty angry. I'm actually pretty hyper. I've been pretty hyper for quite some times, since I was a kid actually. And when I don't drink, I'm absolutely wired. I am wired for sound. Without the meds, I'd be fucked. That's why I take them; amphetamines actually calm me the down, imagineer that. 

But it has been a week and some change. Over the past two weeks, I have only drank once. Well, I drank on one evening, but that evening, I drank quite a bit. I probably shouldn't be thinking about that, though. 

I just want to be calm. Mentally chill. Physically satiated. I'd like to be able to watch a movie. Just sit down, chill out with the dog.

And it hasn't been easy. Sometimes I am successful and manage to stay sober or just have a couple drinks and stop. But most other times I just slip right back and keep drinking, buying more and more alcohol until I pass out. Recently I've been beginning to realize I have a drinking problem. I guess I always knew I had a drinking problem but sort of never really confronted it head on .sort of brushing it under the carpet, or sometimes spending time trying to manage it by giving up alcohol for a month or by just having one drink but then I quickly slip back  into old habits again. 
The place where I feel like I'm in at the moment feels a little terrifying and overwhelming. To realize this is a real problem in my life that I will actually have to put time and effort into managing if I want to live a happy healthy life is kinda scary. I'm terrified cus I'm worried I'll fail and that I'll never truly kick alcohol in the butt. I'm also terrified and almost grieving in advance , the thought of alcohol no longer being in my life. It's been such a huge part of my life since I was a teenager ( I am now 36) and as sad as it sounds a life without alcohol also sounds so hard eventho I know my life& relationships will be so much better and richer without it. 
I feel like I'm at the start of this terrifying journey with so many opportunities to fail and fall back. But at the same time it's a problem I can't ignore anymore.  My relationship with alcohol is intensifying especially even more so since covid started. I work from home so I can easily be hungover cus I don't go into an office, I get angry much more easily while drinking recently, I drink alcohol so much quicker than any of my friends or boyfriend, once I'm on a role I just knock it back like water. My hangovers are getting worse with more intense depression afterwards. And to notice these changes in myself are also terrifying. 
I know I need to turn a corner and change my relationship with alcohol because it's only going to become more intense if I don't make changes now. 
I thought I'd feel pretty liberated about the thought of giving up booze, but I'm actually terrified of the road and battle that lies ahead. Am I crazy to feel like this or has anyone else felt this way?",5,1

Looking back to my daily life just a month ago is hard to fathom - how did I let myself get that way? How did I do that day in and day out? How did I risk everything I have, all the time? 

The only way I can describe what it was like was being under a spell. I remember many brief moments where I would think that I was going to get it under control, to take it easy that night, to take a break, to limit myself...and then yet another drunken week and then month and then year would slip by where I somehow didn’t question it. Ten years later and I was still finding myself semi often puking bile in the bathroom sink before work - looking at myself in the mirror with a red bloated face and bloodshot eyes, drooling between heaves. I knew it was terrible, I knew it was wrong, I knew how pitiful I had gotten - but I accepted it - this was my life - I absolutely needed the alcohol and there was nothing I could do about it. I was spellbound. 

I wish I could say that one day the spell was magically released, but truth is I got very very lucky and got the number of a psychiatrist because I wanted to look into getting medication for depression/anxiety. It turned out that he also worked in an addiction clinic too, so after a couple sessions with him he said “why don’t you swing on in today and talk with them?” So I did, and after some tests they gave me the Vivitrol injection. I tapered off of alcohol over the course of a week using light beer and then some benzos (which the psychiatrist was nice enough to prescribe) for a couple days. Day by day the spell had less strength. 

I’m not fooling myself to think the spell is completely lifted or can’t come back, especially with relying on Vivitrol, but I can say that for the first time in a long long time, alcohol is no longer dictating my life, thoughts and mood.

He just got his license straightened out after 5 years from a DUI and wasn’t feeling confident with driving. He now drives at his new job and after a minute went oh driving a not that bad 🤣It’s our most expensive bill after rent every month.  We decided that it had to be a Monday flight because he works weekends and also wanted to do it ASAP as he’s starting another part time job soon.  Found a great flight leaving out today and booked it however I managed to book it for tomorrow.  Of course I have a crappy debit card because my credit score sucks so it already maxed it my daily limit.  Thankfully I had cash ran to the grocery store got a prepaid debit card and booked the flight that was leaving in two hours.  Well I’m at the grocery store and of course I have to pass through the beer/wine section to get to the ice cream which is now desperately needed.  I watched a girl loading up alcohol in her cart and I’m sitting there thinking dang I wish I could have a drink.  She ended up in front of me in line with over $70 of alcohol this is exactly the reason why I have the money now to deal with cleaning out the storage unit not spending all of my money on liquor.

It seems like they are in opposition. Many of us drank to lower our inhibitions, particularly to feel more comfortable socially. But I wonder if the impact went beyond that.

When I was a teenager, I was dedicated to a pursuit that took a lot of time and discipline. When I started really drinking when I went to college, that ability to focus and stay in disciplined pursuit of my goals seemed to have gone away. 

I am finding some incremental success now with things that require willpower/self discipline in the 8 months since I put down the bottle. I've been able to lose weight, and am at a healthy weight again for the first time in nearly 10 years. Work is going better and is less stressful as I think my work habits are improving. But I feel sad because I think I could have avoided suffering and achieved different things if I hadn't lost roughly 20 years of developing this ""muscle"" by dousing it liberally in a potent neurotoxin.

I was wondering if anyone else has experienced their willpower improving after they stop drinking? If so, why do you think this is? I'd really love to hear others' stories for inspiration, and I'm also super curious to hear thinking on reasoning for this.",6,0

Because i tried Naltraxone in July 2018 (didn't work for me at all, medicine gave me terrible side effects and after the third day i drank through the blockers... which to insurance Companies signifies that i am a solidified alcoholic/opiod abuser.

The best was after dinner, when everyone felt sluggish and had to take some shots to ""wake up"" for a few more hours of hanging out. I had a ton of energy still, and loudly cheered ""Shots! Shots! Shots!""' for them. I know what they were feeling. I'm so grateful to finally be free of my liquor handcuffs.

I, like many people, have been struggling really hard during Covid to not drink. I thought I could moderate and, surprise, that quickly got out of hand. While I wouldn't drink every day, the days I would drink would be from sun up to sun down. I'd drink the next morning to not have to deal with the hangover. I'd call in sick from work... I work remote so that feels even more shameful.

Anyway, last week I really went off the rails and ended up drinking roughly 50 drinks from Sunday afternoon to Wednesday afternoon. Smoked a whole pack of cigarettes (I usually have one or two cigarettes per month). Now this may either sound like a lot or not a lot depending on where ya'll have been on your journey, but it was more than a lot for me. 

I stopped drinking on last Wednesday around 6pm and haven't drank since. It has been a hell of 4, going on 5 days now. Fatigue, confusion, dizziness, trouble concentrating, upset stomach, poor sleep, etc. Each day getting better than the last, I ran 12 miles over the weekend. Today I woke up and felt pretty good for the first time, it was going to be a good day until I looked at my Garmin Heart Rate data from last week. Now normally my heart rate goes up with drinking and that's what I expected to see, and for the most part that's what I saw. But on Wednesday of last week, when I slammed around 10-12 beers in 3 hours, I saw a ten minute period where my HR not slowed, but plummeted from around 95BPM to 30-35BPM... which is extremely low. Enter a flood of new anxiety. I am an athlete and normally my sleeping HR is around 45BPM, but I have never under any circumstance dropped into the 30's. I feel like I was knocking on deaths door, and that scares the shit out of me. This drug scares the shit out of me. 

Today will still be a good day, but damn I'm scared. I hope I can remember this scared feeling when I see alcohol in the future. I want to live. I want to be happy. I want to be healthy. Just as all of us deserve those things. I will not drink today.",9,1

I thought I could, but I couldn't. Once I started, I couldn't stop. I didn't like myself anymore. I had ballooned up to over 300 pounds. I became an asshole.

It was a Sunday, July 27, 2013. I went out to meet a friend for lunch. 

Eight hours later I was at home, not sure how I got there, and fell over in the bathroom, putting a hole in the wall.

I wasn't sure how I paid my tab. As it turns out I didn't. I just left.

I woke up the next morning and said I will not drink again. 

I went to an AA meeting. Then another. (It wasnt for me, but I'm glad I went).

I went for a run/walk. 2 miles. It took me 35 minutes. In the Army, I was running 2 miles in 13 minutes.

I continued to run. It was my escape. It became my high. 

Six months later I was down to 205 pounds. Size 44 pants to 34.

I lost a lot of ""friends"". I think they probably didn't want to admit they had a problem, too.

I have been sober for 7 years. It hasn't always been easy, but every day is easier than the last. 

I have made the journey and I feel much better.

If you are on the journey, keep going.

I'm proud of each one of you. No matter if it's been one day or 1 million days.

Have lost most of my circle of friends due to the fact that I can’t stand being around them when they drink. Oh well.  I guess at this point, sobriety has lost its sheen and now it’s just the mundane work of going about my day to day life without alcohol. 

It’s at this point where the voices in your head start to say things like, “You can probably have a drink man. It’s been like two years. You can probably handle it now!”  The memories of waking up with anxiety, feeling like shit all day (or the next two days), and hurting those around me have seemed to fade. The memories have lost their impact. And that is why I continue to come to SD.  I was never an AA guy so SD is where I come to be around others like myself. I nearly ruined everything I worked my entire adult life to achieve.  I now have a wonderful girlfriend who is 100% down with supporting my lifestyle and doesn’t drink because of me. That’s priceless to me. 

Lots of ups and downs. Lots of learning to deal with life and emotions while sober. It’s hard. But just remember that at some point, sobriety can become mundane. And that’s where the little voices can start creeping in. My resolve has to remain hardened.

This is particularly special to me because when I had gotten sober a couple of years ago, before my wedding, 100 days was the last celebration post I had made on this subreddit. I don't think I got much further than that before I relapsed. In that previous 100 days post I had talked about how I had a few occasions in those 100 days where I had had one drink for things like weddings or birthday dinners. I still viewed drinking alcohol as something to be desired. Something good that I was rewarding myself with on special occasions. That was my downfall, I believe. I started drinking more and more at special events as my wedding got closer and closer and eventually ended up right back where I was before I stopped drinking.

I can proudly say, today, I have not drank a single drop of alcohol in 100 days. I spent my early days of sobriety really working hard to re-train my brain to have a different view on alcohol. It's not something great that I'm denying myself. It's not something I want but can never have. It's something I never have to have again. It's literal poison that only ever takes things from me without ever giving anything real in return.

I am so excited to have reached this point once again, but in an even better place than a few years ago. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it. I can't wait to see what each new day of sobriety is like now that I've reached this point and am moving beyond it. And no matter what else happens, IWNDWYT.",9,0

I was underemployed in a dead end job, convinced there was nothing else. I treated my family like they didn’t exist because I didn’t have the energy for empathy. 

Since February, I went from 182lbs to 158lbs just by not drinking and some light exercise. Anxiety isn’t as bad either. A promising career shift coming up. A freshly furnished apartment to call home. 

As many people on this page say, however, not all of my problems are gone because I stopped drinking. In fact I have way more problems than drinking-me realized. But without drinking, I have proudly found the desire to live and regained my self respect. Having those two qualities, along with being able to think straight, makes every other problem so much easier to handle. 

I want to thank all of you amazing people. I can say with unwavering certainty that this subreddit saved my life. To the veterans who have hundreds of days on me, I envy you. To the beginners who have a day or a week of sobriety, I’m humbled by your bravery to beat this.

The blackouts are scary and are a problem,"I always thought of alcoholism as like a daily dependence thing. Can't get out of bed without a drink. Drinks on their own at home. I dated someone like that before and put him firmly in the Him Versus Me camp, he clearly had an addiction and it was very painful to live with.

Since going through a breakup about three years ago, I've gotten blackout drunk at least ten times I can immediately recall. Probably more. I don't drink regularly, usually I don't drink at home, I'm a short petite female and can have three - four drinks and my short term memory disappears. This has happened predominantly at work social events, as I work a lot. I've woken up and not remembered getting home, I've woken up and not known whose bed I'm in, I've woken up to be told that I hit on a married colleague, and most recently, on Sunday I woke up and couldn't remember how the day ended or what happened after hosting a lunch for friends the day before. 

It's almost two days later now and I'm still afraid to ask.  I'm scared to know how bad I was, who I need to apologise to. I woke up with a searing pain in my hip, from where I took a fall that I don't remember, and with a broken glass in the garbage that I can't explain. 

I'm on Day Two of serious fear, paranoia and a complete shame spiral that what was meant to be such a lovely fun day with friends has ended in this way. 

And enough is enough now. I might drink a dozen times a year, but each time it's 50/50 as to whether I'll end up having a few drinks and heading home, or if I'll black out and wake up in a precarious position with no memory of what happened the night before. It's really scary and isolating and I feel so alone because even I don't understand how I can black out so easily or why this has happened to me with increasing frequency over the years. 

The only option I can see is to get and stay sober indefinitely. My intake is not something I can control these days and that's a scary thing to admit, as someone who is mostly an infrequent drinker in general. So I guess this is me admitting that yes, there is a problem and it's now time to stop drinking indefinitely.",46,0

I just want to leave some words of encouragement to the people who are just starting their journey. Six years ago yesterday was my last drink, I was 2 months shy of my 30th birthday at the time. I was probably the worst alcoholic you would have ever met. In my last few months of drinking I was picking up a 1.750L bottle of dirt cheap vodka, about 5-10 dollar shots of anything else I fancied as well. If that lasted me 24 hours I was happy. I was drinking in excess of 2 liters of vodka every single day. I was homeless with a girlfriend supporting my habit (she's been out of the picture for years now). I became very sick, withdrawing perpetually, always in need of several more chugs. I was having several seizures every day, throwing up constantly and simply wasting away. I stopped eating at the end, couldn't keep anything down. I would chug the vodka and hold it as long as possible and throw up. Sip of water, a single cracker? Throwing up. My body was rejecting everything. I couldn't walk anymore at the end, I became too weak. I lasted over a month with no food at all, just as much vodka as humanly possible, holding it down for a few minutes at a time and puking. July 26th was no different, except that my girlfriend was going out with her family for the day. She helped me up into her bedroom while her parents were getting ready and locked the door behind her. They went out, I was drinking. I had a really bad seizure at some point after finishing the bottle and not having anymore. I fell off the bed and lost all of my bodily fluids. My crap was just this rancid tarry substance and it was all over her rug, her TV remote I remember specifically. When she got home she started punching the shit out of me, she had had more than enough and her room was disgusting, her remote destroyed, her rug stained. I remember her just beating on me like a maniac, I can't blame her honestly. She wanted me out! I couldn't walk though at all. So she called my old friend who lived nearby to come get me. He showed up quick and he was helping me to walk. She lived in a 2nd floor apartment and when I got to the stairs I took one step and fell down the stairs to the bottom. I somehow made it to the parking lot and was just laying there. Ambulance showed up, took me to the hospital. I spent 12 days there, hallucinating, hooked up to IVs, on a few medications. This lasted my first few days in, the hallucinations went away after a while and I became coherent. I had a black female nurse named Esther, she may have been an angel. She would sit there and talk to me. She was the first person who spoke to me honestly but without judgement. She gave me this hope, she planted a seed. When I got out I was still extremely weak and homeless. I fell really bad and got all bruised up and went back to the hospital for a night. Eventually I regained enough strength to go for a job interview using my parents address. It was a dead end stocking job at a Dollar Tree, but it was stability. I worked until the fall started getting cold. I had been working over 2 months at this point, still sober and my parents were proud! They told me to come home to them because winter was coming soon. I did. I kept my job and stayed sober. Eventually they made me an Assistant Store Manager of another location after I bought a car. I stayed there until January 2018. Now I work in a technical field for emergency vehicle technology. Last November I married the girl of my dreams, we bought a house and currently have 2 cats and we adopted a retired greyhound. Life is good! I am a completely different person and nobody I associate with today can believe that would ever be me. I don't drink, I don't smoke anymore, I am that straight edge guy to everybody else. It is unbelievable to me looking back. It's like a movie, like it wasn't even me. I don't crave alcohol or drugs or smoking at all anymore, not whatsoever. There is light at the end of the tunnel. One step at a time, one day at a time. I love you all and IWNDWYT.",72,0

I am a 36 years Pole, working in IT industry since my graduation. I was always a shy type of person with many emotional issues....I always had this feeling like 1000 thoughts going trough my head, and questions like, what do they think of me? Have I done something wrong? Maybe I should no say that, ofc...I should not....but on the other hand? Have I made a bad first impression? How stupid of me?...most of those questions stopped while I was intoxicated....I could stop thinking about all those issues for a while.... I began drinking heavily in 2014, I was finishing my own house, getting married and changing a job for one which turned out to be very stressful as my manager was a bully. After we moved in in late 2014 I though things would get better, but unfortunately it was just the beginning...in early 2017 my dad who also abused alcohol for many years but got sober in 2010 after he literally wrecked his pancreas got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I always though the booze will be his killer but it was his other addiction. So as you can imagine my drinking escalated, I got sober for days only to drive him to a hospital for another chemo or pick him up as my mom did not drive back then. I don't know about doctor in the States but here they totally don't bullshit you and tell you that you are going to die...in 10 months and so he did. Once he got meta to his brain the real shitstorm began, literally. I would never ever wish my greatest enemy to go through what my mom and myself went. Obviously my drinking was not helping the situation...My dad died in Nov 2017 knowing already that I am having issues with alcohol....but in 2018 I got sober, for 10 months....after crashing my jeep thinking I can re-park it in the evening.....I never drink and drive but I was so smart I thought I could re-park it in the evening when I was already not in my best shape if you know what I mean....well my sobriety did not last long, I am a big fan of American BBQ and just bought an offset smoker....so I thought, yea, its spring and I might have a one, just one....as you imagine the whole hell broke loose, I was on a bender for 5 days and thought I would die from anxiety of withdrawals. So here I am, again .... same spot I was in 2017, only a bit wiser but as well more stupid...because I continue doing this crap over and over....I can be sober for 3-4 weeks but then I just need one trigger, usually small one...I am surrounded by women, my wife, mom and her mom....so I don't have any man to talk to or to get support from since my dad passed away. I very often feel this pressure that I need to help them with everything, technical stuff, servicing their cars or fixing the antenna because they disconnected the cable with a vacuum cleaner and called me that the TV is broke....ok, sorry for this long post but as I wrote in the beginning, I had to do this as I have nobody to talk with and this forum will for sure help me to reach sobriety one day do to people sharing their stories.

I just turned 23 and drinking is supposed to be part of my life. Going out? Drink. Hanging with friends? Drink. Watching the game? Drink. It what you’re supposed to do. Except unlike others that might have an off switch I don’t. The problem? I also do this alone.

I used to think “oh I don’t drink every day, it’s not a problem for me” but it is. When I drink it’s 12 or 15 or 18 drinks until I pass out. I might not be a daily drinker RIGHT NOW but I will become one. I have this feeling I’ll die drinking. If I let it consume my life. 

I used to think it’s normal to get plastered. But my getting plastered is different from everyone else’s. I don’t have an off switch. I have drinking or not drinking.

While some can enjoy alcohol I cannot. When I drink I can only think about when I’m having my next. While this doesn’t make you a daily drinker I will become one. It’s tough because all I can think about is the social pressure of drinking with friends, or going to bars.

But it’s a trap. One I will fall into and not be able to climb back out. July 28th (I think I drank past midnight last night) the day I will not drink. 

Just wanted to collect my thoughts. Thank you.",6,0

It's the first time we've spent any time apart since Covid19 lockdown began.

This morning, I realised that it would have been the perfect opportunity to get drunk. If my brain was working that way, I would have realised I could wait until she left on the Friday, go out and buy beer and whisky, and drink until Saturday lunchtime with very little risk of social consequences.

But I didn't think that way at all. I went for a 40k bike ride on Friday and then ate chicken and avocado and quite a lot of ice-cream while having a video chat with some friends. On Saturday I played Torchlight 2, played poker and watched lord of the rings. Then on Sunday I tidied up a bit, made a curry so my wife would have food ready for when she came home, and played some more poker while video chatting with friends.

I honestly didn't even think about drinking alcohol. That feels amazing for me, because my mind does idly drift back to thinking about drinking somewhat frequently. But maybe it's just a weird nostalgia, because when tested, this time, it turns out I'd rather do all the things I like which aren't drinking alcohol. I'm genuinely thrilled.

I already had gabapentin at home from last time, along with acamprosate and bupropion. 

Have been staggering all these medications as directed, except the gaba. I only use that in case my anxiety feels like it’s getting away from me. Which means I’ve just recently taken it. The lorazepam seemed like it’s working...until now. 

I’m scare y’all. This is only day 2 of not drinking. Is this how it’s gonna be for like a whole couple of weeks?

It's day 4 for me today. It's also Monday.
I'm happy to start the week sober and not hungover.

Yesterday I played fallout 4 a playstation game all day. The day before that I browsed the internet all day. I won't be hard on myself because I believe I was healing.

Then I realised that for me playing games and endlessly scrolling is not going to help me reach my goals and get my life back on track. Substance abuse stole my life from me and I want it back.

I didn't wake up on my first alarm. But I'm here now.
I'm going to get in this workout then go for a huge cycle across my city and come home to work.

I watched a video last night of an ex navy seal and ultra marathon runner David Goggins. He's all about mental toughness and going hard. He screamed in one of his workout video's whilst pushing the bench press to the limits ""who is going to carry the boats?"".

And that is just it. We are stranded on this island of addiction. Now we must take this boat to the shore and set off to sea. 

So who is going to carry the boats? We are.

As David Goggins would say. Stay hard.

So many changes!,"Hey, I don’t know if my badge on here says somethings way longer than two weeks, but I’m two weeks sober. At first- I didn’t want to post anything in here until I had more time under my belt...then I figured, fuck that. Last time I was sober for any amount of time was like four days or something. Don’t get me wrong I would go two or three days without alcohol just fine, but never past four you know? Telling myself alright, I made it four days in good to have some now. Then I’d drink for four straight evenings and restart the cycle. 

I am an alcohol abuser. I don’t moderate. I like to party. 

Anyway, two weeks ago, I just felt...over it. I’m overweight (still got it though lol), I make poor decisions food wise, and my sleep schedule was shit. 

I want to give this update to the people who are only on day one, day two, day three. It’s hard on this sub sometimes because of course people have months, years, decades sober. Sometimes it’s hard to wrap your mind around that when you’re still on your first lap. You feel like it’s gonna be FOREVER until you feel better. I’m here to say that’s not the case. 

First 1-4 days. I was irritated. Anxiety high, insomnia, restless legs at night, little bit sweaty. Never had the shakes before, mostly just a short fuse a few days after a good haul. 5th night I didn’t sweat. 6th night I slept like a baby. By day 7....my anxiety tapered way off. I have had no physical cravings. I have only had reflex cravings. (Example: friend calls me up, says they’re going to stop by later...me in my head “oh maybe I better hit the liquor store because ‘socializing’”). I didn’t do it. 

The last week has been a dream. I’m drinking about a gallon of water a day. I’m making jewelry and have begun leather working. I’m painting. The fog has lifted. This is only two weeks in people. My body thanks me. I’ve lost weight. My energy is sky high. My SKIN looks amazing. My patience is now at a normal level. My body is healing itself. 

A few other things I’ve done is, the day I stopped drinking I also began intermittent fasting. I fast 20 hours a day and I only eat during a 4 hour period where I consume no more than 1500 calories. Once a week, I do a 24 hour fast. All I can have during fasts is water. There’s a ton of information out there about the benefits of this. I suggest you look into this lifestyle, I am loving it. Also, I smoke quite a bit of weed. I don’t believe that marijuana is bad, I don’t think it means you’re not “sober”. I realize it’s still mind altering but, it’s not harmful. I’m from Oregon, it’s just part of our culture. But it helps. 

Anyway- my point is. You don’t know how sick you are...until you start healing. Don’t tell yourself that you’re months or years away from feeling better when the truth is, you might be like me and feel better only after 7 days. I chose to stop drinking for myself. I didn’t do anything wrong, wasn’t a fight that provoked it, wasn’t a DUII, wasn’t court ordered, it was me. A conscious decision to just walk away. This time, is so much different than my past. 

I just want others out there to feel the liberation I am experiencing. I don’t do meetings, I don’t like that you’re encouraged to label yourself an alcoholic. You name is your label. Alcohol is a substance we struggle with, but it need not forever be tethered to our identity. I feel powerful turning down booze. I feel in control that I don’t drink. When I’m offered a drink I don’t say “no, I really shouldn’t” or “no, I can’t”. I just say “No thanks, alcohol really isn’t my thing these days” and that’s that. :)

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

My AoK for the week started with one of the paradoxes that I've encountered in sobriety. Recovery from alcoholism has been full of odd little paradoxes for me. I keep my sobriety by giving what I have away to others. I share what I have learned in order to learn more things. I don't think about drinking because I talk about it. And in order to become less self-centered, I have to focus on myself.

I *am* self-centered, more than I ever realized before I got into recovery. I think about myself *constantly*. But the solution isn't just to turn my attention to other people. I also have to take care of my own needs in order to be able to give appropriately. Otherwise my unmet needs rear up in unhealthy ways in my interactions with others, and I'm giving something because there's something that I want in return.

So, in sobriety, I've been learning more about taking care of myself and meeting my own needs. That's not a selfish thing, that's healthy. And one of the things that I learned back when I was doing a bunch of therapy is that play is a need. I've been under a bit of pressure recently and I've been neglecting giving myself permission to do some fun things. 

It doesn't mean that I'm constantly working, what happens is that I just end up giving myself unsatisfying and not particularly restful downtime doing things like following weird rabbit holes down the internet, playing not especially fun games on my phone, and watching TV. I don't feel better for it, and I'm also not spending my time productively. It's a stress thing, and times are weird and my schedule is all out of whack, but it's not serving me particularly well, so I decided this week to consciously choose to do something different and give myself a couple of blocks of time to focus on doing fun things.

So today, instead of looking at all the stuff that needs to get done and then frittering away several hours before getting down to actually doing anything, I gave myself a chunk of time to do something that I want to do. 

I decided to finish an arts and crafts project that I started in February. I'd decided to make a decorative wreath for the front door of my new place, gathered the supplies, and then got swamped by life. 

I'm sorta into dinosaurs in a low-key, non-scientific way, and my artistic vision for the wreath was fake fern fronds (ferns are freaking *old* - they've been around since before the supercontinent Pangea formed) and fake airplants for the greenery (airplants strike me as probably evolving at a much later date, but they *look* prehistoric. And also cool.) For the accents I glue gunned in a smattering of realistic looking miniature dinosaurs. It's overthinking in the extreme, but this is the sort of thing that makes me happy.

And today, I finally finished my wreath and put it on my front door. That feels good. I had a fun time. It turned out exactly how I wanted. And while nobody would've looked at the current state my house is in and said, ""You know, what this place *really* needs is a whimsical decorative wreath to coordinate with the stacks of cardboard boxes and half-stripped wallpaper in nearly every room and bring it all together,"" it was an AoK to myself to spend some time doing something that I wanted to do, rather than something that I felt like I *had* to do.

My other AoK for the week was making sure to spend time with my cat, brushing him and playing with him. (He doesn't run for toys, he's above that, but he does enjoy having them dangled directly above him so he can hunt from the comfort of lying on his back.) One good thing about sheltering in place was that we got to spend a lot of quality hang time together, and now that I've gotten busy again I wanted to make sure that I'm still remembering my furbuddy's needs.

Well, this isn't quite the post that I thought I was going to write, but that's what I've got for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?

When I’m sober I don’t see any people other than my close friends and family.

I have now realised I love it this way. Quarantine helped me for sure, when it was ok to see people again I only wanted to see a few people. Those few people I do see are the only people I need in my life right now. I now see pictures and videos of friends doing fun things and I don’t feel sad or jealous like I once did, I’m happy they are having a good time.

I know exactly one person who doesn’t drink. Since I’ve made my position clear to a few friends, it seems they’ve forgotten I exist. Not that there was a lot of contact with me in the first place.

I’m tired of feeling alone and having nothing to look forward to. I’m 8 days in, which isn’t a lot. I try to tell myself this is worth it, I’m healthier, I’m saving money, etc.

But what’s the point of a long life if I can’t have fun or friends any more? I feel like I’m not going to accomplish anything meaningful or I would have done it already. 

I guess I’m just struggling to grasp the whole meaning of life in general. I think I drank to keep myself from thinking about it, in part. I wish I was actually dumber sometimes, or perhaps cared less. I wish I could believe in a higher power. But it’s not for me.

They do nothing for me. My entire job takes place on zoom and I feel like I'm at work when I do the online meetings. I still attend them, but I hate them. 

I was so excited when I learned that one of the local AA spots has opened back up. I couldn't wait to go. I just got back and I'm so livid. It was a full house and more than HALF the people there weren't wearing a mask. Even worse, there were people who brought masks, but took them off because others weren't wearing them. I got nothing out of that meeting because I was so uncomfortable. I was supposed to get my 3 month chip today(I had a small relapse when covid first started) and I didn't because my blood was boiling. 

I hate this covid thing. It gives me such anxiety and I feel like its taking away so much from my life. When I go to a meeting and see so many people without masks it just reminds me that this shit is not going away anytime soon. 

I said something to the big wigs after the meeting and their response was, ""what do you want me to do? Kick them out?"" Fuck yes!!

I'm sorry I know this post is off topic but I have to rant at someone. Has anyone else gone back to in person meetings yet? Is this a problem where you're from too?

Most people just see that as 2 extra days off, I saw it as another 2 days I could keep putting as much booze in my body as possible. My usual benders would have been Friday evening to midday Sunday, maybe Sunday evening if I was feeling froggy. Then it turned into Friday to Monday. Then Friday to Tuesday evening. Then Tuesday night. Waking up Wednesday and going to work wondering why I kept doing it to myself always saying “This is the week, I’m done with it”. I wouldn’t drink anything Wednesday after work. Then I caught myself just getting a few airplane bottles after work on Thursday, because I spent Wednesday sober, so I earned it right? Friday morning would come and I would watch the clock, just waiting until I could get off to start the next bender. I had a whole week off two weeks ago, with plans to get so much done, yet caught myself drunk from Friday until the following Saturday. Drove to 7/11 at 1am Sunday morning right before they stopped serving so I could get a few more airplane bottles just to get me through the night. Sunday morning comes, here comes the withdrawal. Waited until 9am with plans to taper off, but we all know how that goes. I decided to go to the hospital with clear withdraw symptoms and they gave me an IV, a shot of Ativan, and a weeks worth of tapering Librium. That day I decided I was done. I was done being hungover and “having a morning drink just for some hair of the dog”. Tired of my girlfriend watching me get pass out drunk by 3pm and sleeping until 10pm.

I always told myself ""I'm not THAT bad, I only drink two nights a week!"" but that's kinda the trap isn't it? You tell yourself there are people ""worse off"" and feel more justified in your own actions. I was bad for binging every weekend, and while it may be less than what other people would drink, i not only was hurting my body but also my quality of life.

In the past I'd get off work/class on a Friday, go to the liquor store, and buy a quart (approx) of 45% (90 proof) vodka or 45% (90 proof) whiskey. Then over the next two days I'd shut myself in my apartment or bedroom and spend my weekend drinking half that quart each night, Friday and Saturday.

I can hear other people already saying they drink much more, or some who might try to justify their actions by saying they drink less, but please, comparisons don't do much. What matters isn't the quantity. what matters is:

\-**The isolation**. I closed myself off and drank alone, conversing with people over facebook only or playing games

\-**The shame**. Waking up the next day not remembering what I talked about and with who, and having to scroll through my messages to see if I made an ass of myself

\-**The need**. Drinking half the bottle in a night then looking at it and thinking ""but what if I drank MORE"" or sneaking shots from my parents alcohol cabinet (they were good enough to let me stay here while I get a degree, they deserve better, and I deserve to not feel like a thief)

\-**The habit**. Getting so used to waking up sick on Saturday and Sunday mornings that now when people make plans with me on those days, I have to fight the urge to immediately reply with ""no"" because I used to ""recover"" those on days. Not anymore, now I can say ""yes!"" :)

\-**The concern**. Having friends who saw me getting drunk basically any night that wasn't a work night, watching me beat around the bush and make rules like ""I don't drink when I'm upset"" knowing FULL DAMN WELL that buying a bottle put me in a good mood, and knowing they were concerned with how I acted when I was drunk and how fast I was drinking.

\-**The fear**. Being afraid that my memory may never be what it used to be, or my overall health, it's all been hurt by my weekend binges, and I am still sometimes scared that I'll never fully ""recover"" from what I've done

\-**The gluttony**. Pounding back half a quart in 2 or 3 hours along with half a large pizza + candy, then hoping the 750 cals of straight whiskey will dull the shame of that

The quantity doesn't matter because different amounts hit people differently. What does matter is that **we all experience the negative social, physical, mental, and emotional effects of alcohol.** I always told myself ""I could always be worse"", but today I tell myself ""I could always have done better, and will do better as I go""

I'm on my longest sober spell for 10 years, and I'm proud of that. I dunno what the future holds but I know that I Will Not Drink With You Today, and that's enough <3",1145,0

July 5th, 2020. I woke up with the all-too familiar headache. I felt disgusted at myself. But that day was different. I knew that my ""never again"" speech I gave myself on the morning after was different this time. I was done. Three weeks later, I'm still sober and will never be drunk again. 

I met my girlfriend at college in 2017. I graduated in December 2018 and we've been long-distance ever since (3.5 - 5 hours depending on if she's at college or at home). Due to COVID, our weekend trips have been limited. I'm an essential employee and she has people in her household with breathing problems. They've been self-quarantined for months with very little social contact. They live in the suburbs and I live in a rural area. She's moving fifteen hours away at the end of the month for grad school. 

On June 27th, a group of friends and I decided to have a Saturday out and about, with alcohol definitely involved. I was due to spend the Fourth of July with my girlfriend and her family, enjoying the long weekend with them before she moved off. In my dumb state, I told her that I thought COVID was a non-issue and that I didn't even consider the fact that I would be putting her family at risk. 

On the evening of June 27th, I promised her I was done drinking and that I'd self-quarantine for two weeks so that I could see her before she moves. 

On July 4th, one week later, I'd forgotten that promise and went to a Fourth of July party - no social distancing, no masks, nothing. I drank almost an entire fifth of spiced rum. I don't know why I did...I usually don't drink that heavily. I agreed to ride around with some friends and they dropped me off at my family's house at the end of the night. I woke up the next morning and asked my mom to take me to my car. I told her I was done, I was done hurting the people I love. I was done putting my relationship on the rocks and I was done hurting my parents. 

My mom dropped me off at the house I'd gotten drunk in that night. I saw the party host and told him I needed to get help...that I'd had enough and that I was done for good. I drove off without even saying goodbye. 

I got home and immediately signed up for therapy on BetterHelp. I told my girlfriend point-blank what I'd done. I have never been so ashamed. I still wear that guilt like a scarlet letter today. 

She was heartbroken that I'd lied to her. She was heartbroken that I'd not self-quarantined. Long story short, she was heartbroken at my actions that so befit someone with a substance abuse problem: the self-centeredness, the lying, the lapses in judgement, the victim mentality, etc.. 

She called me after work on July 6th intent on breaking up with me. I told her I was done drinking for good and begged her for another chance. I turned my car around while on the phone and told her I was going for a COVID test because of my reckless actions. I'd started feeling chest congestion and a headache, but figured they were just my nerves playing tricks on me. Then the body chills started. 

She gave me a third chance. I got tested. I entered self-quarantine and started working from home.

On July 11th, I was supposed to go on a big kayaking trip with my best friends, but I opted out of going because 1) I had not received my test results yet and 2) I wanted to socially distance so that I could prove to her that I was serious. 

But then here comes the selfishness aspect of being an addict: I thought to myself ""well, if I just invite them over after they get done kayaking, and if we just keep our distance, everything should be okay."" 

I invited them over and told my girlfriend that I'd found a happy medium between social distance and social interaction. She told me to do whatever I wanted to do. I asked her if having them over would put additional strain on our relationship, but I could not get a response out of her. I then told her she was right, and that I would not have them over. 

About two hours later, she called me and told me she was done. She was breaking up with me. Ten minutes into that conversation, my mother came into my bedroom and told me we were putting our cat of fifteen years down on July 13th, that Monday. I absolutely lost my mind: two major parts of my life were ending at the exact same time. I felt like I had a sword shoved through my stomach. I absolutely lost my mind, threw my phone down, and sobbed on my bedroom floor. I didn't know what to do. 

I think my girlfriend didn't have it in her heart to go through with the breakup after she heard me break down. We agreed on a break with minimal communication. We were still together, just not talking. I still not had received my test results, but I was physically feeling fine. 

On July 15th, my jaw hit the floor: I tested positive. And for the first time in my adult life, something bad happened and it was all on my shoulders with absolutely no room for semi-viable excuses. I took all responsibility for my actions. I told my therapist. 

I was nearing the end of my quarantine since symptom onset and returned to work on July 20th. 

My girlfriend and I talked on the phone for thirty minutes on July 22nd. She asked me what I wanted to do, and I told her I still wanted to be in a relationship with her and that being in limbo regarding our status was killing me. 

We agreed to continue to be on hiatus until a week after she moved to her new city so that she could have time to get settled. I told her I understood and that i'd fight like hell every day to keep her. I told her that I had tested positive. She asked me to send her a photo of the test result because I had lied to her so much that she wasn't even sure if she could believe something even as serious as that. I did. I told the truth. 

This weekend, I even turned down an opportunity to go drinking!

The moral of the story: I don't know what the future holds for our relationship. I truly hope and pray we're able to survive this. I truly want us to work. If we don't work out, it will be 100% due to my actions and my selfishness. My desire to drink and have a good time. My desire to feel good for a few hours on Saturday night. 

I'm taking steps to better myself, I'm talking to a therapist, and as of today, I'm 21 days sober. I don't know if anything I can do now can save our relationship and I am willing to live with the long-term consequences of my actions. 

My parents appear to not have caught it. My stepdad has COPD and is 70 years old and my mother is 55. They're both smokers. Smoking is one vice I never picked up, surprisingly. 

But I just wanted to come here to open up about what finally did it for me. I already feel better! When I was drinking, I felt like I was in a rut. It was very hard to find joy and excitement. It became hard to feel life.

But my sense of feeling, my sense of purpose, my sense of joy is coming back. I can only pray that we stay together at this point. But regardless, I'm becoming a better person through this.

Tl;dr: if you’ve stopped. Stay stopped. This is my story of negotiating with the devil, while fully knowing he need not be a part of my life. 

Longtime lurker and minimal poster on this sub on my main account. I’ve been an alcoholic for 5 years. In and out sobriety along the way. I’ve been detoxed 4 times and to a rehab facility once. That REALLY got me on track and I was able to get close to a year sober. 

I became a staple in my AA community, chaired meetings, had a sponsor and sponsored others. Even had the profound opportunity to 12th step others and intervene to save them from this horrid disease. 

What changed? Life got good again. Relationships fixed. Progress with career goals was aligned. Like many of us, I felt like I “got this” and was safe to drink again. All of the knowledge and one liners of AA slowly, but surely fell out of the window. 

It happened when I began dating again. Stupid excuse.  I’m a gay man and it’s really hard to find anyone sober where I live who is gay. I thought I could handle this but clearly I cannot. 

For the last year I have reengaged in drinking. Still attending meetings but never admitting where I was at. Covid has not helped. At all. Remote work in lockdown + relapse are not good at all. 

By all appearances I am an extremely high functioning person. I make very good money for my age, have a beautiful home, drive a fancy car and hide my drinking from most loved ones. In fact, I’ve found myself in a double life situation - one where I drink with a certain set (mostly problem drinkers who haven’t realized it yet) and am the sober person with others (family, longtime friends and loved ones). The cognitive dissonance is torture. 

Welp. I’m back to daily drinking. I’m meticulous about it all. I measure how much “I think” what someone at my body weight can have without overwhelming my GABA receptors and triggering withdrawal if I “have to stop” for any reason. Meanwhile, this is a cute lie. It would take an actual apocalypse or extraordinary intervention for me to end this habit of quietly negotiating with my evening demon and calculating the amount I will drink. I know all about kindling effect and know that someone like me just can’t drink anymore. Thank you, insidious disease. I’m up to roughly 5-7 units a day. Which is disgusting. Toss in a social event with my drinking friends and that limit disappears. 

Which is where I spent my entire weekend. It’s Sunday, I’m sober (for now) and I hate myself. It’s already near the evening and my eyes are still red, my body hurts, I’ve done nothing productive and tomorrow, I will be in business critical meetings that may determine the future of my current job. I can’t even tell you guys how much I drank this weekend. Was that bad. 

Guess what that is begging me to do, though? Slam it even harder.  I’m certain that 5 units will not cut it and I’ll be shaking by Monday noon. I’m so sick of this habit. I’m so sick of measuring alcohol and hiding from all but my most problematic “friends”. 

I’d like to get a day one in order. And right quick. I’m just terrified I will need a rehab and probably detox. When I first went to rehab, I loved it! Everyone was amazing! I committed and they saw the effort and it was repeatedly mentioned by staff I was a pillar example of someone who would make it. Enough so I was elected the community leader less than two weeks in. And I wasn’t faking it - I really wanted this to be over. 

Im in a part of the world where a 30-90 program would not be easily supported without losing my job, home, etc. my family is kind of sick of my problem and I just don’t want to let them down - AGAIN.  But I’m also now scared for my health. Sick of dancing with the devil every evening for nothing more than a dependence. I don’t even like feeling drunk. I just have to drink or I’ll slide into withdrawal. I know I will. 

Tapering never works. I’ve even amounted a stock of Benzos and Gabapentin to do it at home. But the addict in me just ends up mixing that with booze to get extra funky and without belaboring the idea- it’s not a solution. 

I suppose I’m writing here today to let folks who may be on their own fence about “trying” to drink again that THEY SHOULD NOT. This is the worst merry-go-round imaginable. This year has basically been lost to my habit, because it’s stifled my relationships, my ability to form new ones (notwithstanding the drinking buddies) and despite some glimmering moments, everything has been broadly paused to accommodate drinking. And here I am. Quite certain I need a program again. F this. 

I can’t wait to say I will not drink with you today. 

For now, please read what I have said and please do not drink with me tonight. 
 
With love,
Your fellow alcoholic",34,2

I believe this was written around 6 months into the legal process. I want to remember.

\-----

I felt adrenaline, a pit in my stomach, and slight relief when the flashing lights filled the cab of my pickup truck. Garaged and maintained by my uncle, freshly bought by me. Camping, fishing, and canoe trips for the summer were in my plans, but now it was winter and I had only hiked once.

I stayed mostly awake for processing, but I couldn't answer all of the officer's questions. Exactly how many drinks? Too drunk to keep my mouth shut, I responded... five? I wondered if that number made sense based on what the officer had seen of my behavior. Did I seem five drinks drunk? Later the officer would tell me two or three times, ""If you ever feel like this, don't drive."" I felt nothing.

When I was caught off-guard by his question about the mud stain on my knee, he laughed softly with pity. I said nothing but the surprise on my face must have been plain. Oh yeah, it was that damned ditch I couldn't climb out of 2 miles from my home because I had a 6 pack of dark ale in one hand.

About a month later, I learned from a drug counselor using a slide ruler that I had the equivalent of 11-12 drinks that night. Even that seemed like a low estimate if I was being honest. In the courtroom, the record stated that I openly told the officer I had 5 or 6 drinks, and had a BAC of 0.24. Being caught like that by a stranger who suddenly had power over my life I finally felt something: Regret. There were so many opportunities for that night to go a different way. I had gotten drunk around dinner, thought I sobered up during an hour long conversation with my dad and stepmom, and finally doubled down on getting drunk again after. Bouncing between bars and cheerfully telling all my new friends that I was going home to rest. Absolutely I'm getting an Uber, no question. Actually, I'm getting a double shot of tequila if I can convince the last available bartender that I just started my night.

That night had everything; loneliness, attraction, fear of rejection, and finally making myself comatose so I wouldn't have to continue putting on a performance anymore. As strangers started to enjoy my company I started to hate the way I behaved. That night I was desperate for attention. I started with no plan besides get some beers and have dinner out. Then I saw a girl. I drank too late to get food and started to lose control. I misjudged how much alcohol had been processed while I was on the phone and launched myself past the edge of oblivion.

I was too far out in the country for an Uber at midnight. I had lost track of my new friends and had a feeling they hated me and might have kicked me in the ribs while I was on the ground at one point. My walk home took so long that I got another burst of energy and decided to sprint back to my truck and drive, just to save time in the morning. Just to do something nice for my future self. I had lost my 6 pack of beer somewhere in a ditch. Once I got to my vehicle, I started craving Taco Bell.  I don't remember turning the key or navigating the one-way streets to the drive-up window. I don't remember what I ordered. All I remember is snapping back into a sluggish reality as red and blue lights came up fast behind me.

\-----

This wasn't the end of my self-destruction. There were almost three more years of experiences before I understood that the reason my behavior made no sense was because of addiction. And addiction wasn't just something I had to feed a little every day, it was starving the rest of my life of any sustenance. I'm here today because I decided to take sobriety one hour at a time and view every night I go to sleep without drinking as the biggest accomplishment of my life so far.",44,0

Bited someone that was trying to help me 
Bruises everywhere.
Spent all my money and savings on booze drugs and hookers and now my landlord sent an eviction lettter because i did not my last 2 rent. 

Ive been reading a lot here, my plan was to finally end my appartment. Secure the relationship with my love and get some saving before putting my focus on being sober. I got so closed.  But the mania of the chase made me go berserm and i destroyed everything.

I stopped drinking to help with my home life (I was a function alcoholic and it never interfered with work - other than the occasional hangover). I didn’t originally set out to make it a lifestyle change but after all these steps and the knowledge I’ve gained I think I may just stick with it. My eyes are open and my body is toxin free; it’s revitalizing! 

No one knows this part of my life, even my parents think it’s “just a break”.

I'll spare the sordid details, I think that hurt me on the last post I made on a different sub.

Basically, I've been to inpatient rehab a bunch of times and done sober living several times. I tend to relapse faster than normal when I go into sober living houses, and I think it's largely due to the stress of living so close with so many people.

I'm in the midst of a really bad relapse and I'm terrified I'm not going to survive this one. I probably need inpatient rehab, but I have little money and no insurance.

In the past, I've heard of sober communities. I'm willing to do whatever to try to beat this thing, including move and work virtually any job. I was hoping someone on Reddit could guide me. Thanks

I stopped two weeks ago thinking I just wanted a little break and set a goal date (September) so that I can really stop the habit of ""one or two"" drinks a day. I'm feeling so much better overall. I have more energy, less anxiety (I drank to calm my nerves as much as anything else...), and honestly feel like I have gained a ""bonus"" day at the end of every work day. I get more done without feeling stressed about it. Chores don't feel like chores. I'm in graduate school with several hours worth of homework per week, and instead of feeling pushed to squeeze it into my schedule I'm actually ahead on my task list. Well, except for the paper I should be writing right now... But I have zero stress about making time for it today. I don't have to squeeze in homework before having a beer, and don't have to try and write papers with a foggy mind. 

I'm also realizing, with a little pain, how much I underestimated my drinking. I said in my initial post (and to my doctor, friends, and self) that I have one or two drinks most nights, usually stopping there, and usually not getting drunk or tipsy. 

Lies. 

I drank at least three drinks most nights, often four, and while I wasn't drunk I was often tipsy. I wouldn't have driven or had a meeting for school in that state. I didn't answer the phone when people called from my church or school because I knew I wasn't mentally present. In fact, I avoided commitments or meetings after 7 PM because it was annoying to have to not drink until then. 

I said I would stop until at least September 1 and go from there. I don't know if I'll have another drink or not. I don't know if I'll work in moderation or just stay totally sober. I'm not worried about it. I'm certainly not missing anything about drinking. My life may be better sober. 

I've finally told my sisters, with whom I'm very close. I'm honestly so excited and want to share...but worried that if I do talk about it with some friends that they won't quite understand, and if I do have a glass of wine six month down the road they'll be worried I've relapsed, when my sobriety isn't really like that.

I follow you around, I always have

This grief has a gravity, it pulls me down
But a tiny voice whispers in my mind
You are lost, hope is gone
But you must go on
And do the next right thing
Can there be a day beyond this night?
I don't know anymore what is true
I can't find my direction, I'm all alone
The only star that guided me was you
How to rise from the floor?
But it's not you I'm rising for
Just do the next right thing
Take a step, step again
It is all that I can to do
The next right thing
I won't look too far ahead
It's too much for me to take
But break it down to this next breath, this next step
This next choice is one that I can make
So I'll walk through this night
Stumbling blindly toward the light
And do the next right thing
And, with it done, what comes then?
When it's clear that everything will never be the same again
Then I'll make the choice to hear that voice
And do the next right thing.

I'd been working out and was feeling good, had started to get back to actually do my hobbies, watching movies I'd intended to watch for literal years, spending time doing things for myself again.  I was holding two cases of diet pop, my reward to myself for not drinking, because I know it's not the best for me either.  I was 25 years old, and felt like I was getting some semblance of an idea of what life ""was"", as we all do.  I'd realized how much drinking had kept me stuck in place for the past 4 years of my life, and I was watching my closest friends become dark, angry alcoholics around me.  

I stood there and thought, I don't need this, I should quit drinking now and just save myself the trouble.  It's doing nothing for me anymore and those early 20's days are gone, and what I'm left with isn't the fun drunken nights we once had.  People were becoming very bitter and angry.  The music filled nights of laughter were gone and in their place was a bunch of angry men in their mid 20's with no direction.  I was the only one at the time that was dating someone (we're still together), and I just saw what the future could possibly be if I didn't take charge of my life and kick the (now boring) habits.

I've never hit the darkest, deepest bottoms of alcoholism, but I've had my rough patches.  I wish I'd have listened to myself at 25 and stuck on that regimen of working out and taking care of myself.  The past 4 years of drinking have been a pale comparison of what I ""learned"" that drinking was back when everyone was still carefree, the feeling of being out on our own still fresh and exciting.  I've quit for long stretches, and I'm mostly proud with my progress.  I never really crave a drink until about a month in, then I break down because I'm feeling good and let my recuperation phase start again.

There's no real point to this post, just to get something out there concrete that I can reflect on when the urge comes again.  I've known for going on 5 years now that I don't even enjoy it anymore, yet it's always calling my name, and I give in from time to time.  I've seen people asking just how much a short relapse can set you back, and speaking from experience I'll tell you, I can be on top of the world, bursting with energy, so much so that I don't know what to do with it, then decide to have one night of ""old times"" drinking and wind up with aches and pains and depressive thoughts for weeks until it fades yet again.  No relapse is worth it, and it hasn't been for years, and I just need to listen to myself, because I know all of this until I don't.

I have great support in my life and I'm no longer surrounded by the dark and dour alcoholics that I was some years back, and I know I can do it, because I've gone for very long periods without.  I just need to remind myself to not be stupid.  Those ""glory days"" are long gone and it's hard for me to remember that sometimes.  You never see the hangover the people drinking have the following day, only the fun they won't remember that night.",3,0

There was a recent post here that post here that really resonated with me... it was about the faux fancy feeling with drinking wine. I felt like I was looking into the mirror when reading that post. 

I was never really a drinker at all. In fact, I use to think it was weird that people would drink beer and watch TV as a recreational activity, ha!

Several years ago I had an ex boyfriend who was an excessive drinker and we use to drink and party a lot together. Usually, I was the DD and the one picking him up after he had *one of those nights*. I would pick him up from work and he would be trashed. It was an incredibly abusive relationship - both physically and emotionally. Once I had the courage to leave him and get a restraining order.... he use to stalk and harass me. I certainly fell into a cycle alcohol abuse to cope with the fear, depression, anxiety, and PTSD of it all. I attended Al-Anon for a short while and found that helpful. 

I struggled with this cycle for a few years. I’d go awhile without drinking and I would be fine and then the depression, anxiety, PTSD, and self- loathing would kick in and I would be drinking a bottle of liquor and end up a horrible hang over the next day... hating myself even more than the day before.

I had gotten a new boyfriend and things were great. We moved in together and had a roommate. Unfortunately, things at work became so hostile that I found myself in a deep depression again. I use to have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day and began drinking heavily multiple times a week. Things had slowly started to get better when we made the decision to move quite a few states away for a job opportunity. We moved into our new home and things were great... until I found out that he cheated on me right before the big move. This sent me into a another downward spiral for a good few weeks. That was a couple of years ago... 

Fast forward to me seeking out this group...

Well, this past Thursday I certainly had a moment. In the past couple of years, I really no longer drink hard liquor or beer anymore but I do love wine. Maybe once a week or once every other week, I enjoy having a bottle of wine on the weekend as a way to decompress. Every once in awhile... a bottle will turn into two bottles. That’s what happened Thursday. I definitely blacked out and vaguely remember a mutual friend of ours who must of come by to check if I was OK and convince me it was alright to go back home and that my boyfriend would sleep on the couch. He must have texted them because I don’t have any phone calls or texts in my phone (it has died earlier in the evening). I woke up with puke and leaves in my hair and on the floor. My knees were scuffed up. Definitely but my lip at some point... all signs of just a night turned wrong from over drinking. 

I guess as I’m writing this... I’m noticing that my drinking is directly related to my depression. I see my therapist tomorrow and I’m going to ask about going back on antidepressants. But I guess what has me frustrated with myself is that I don’t know why I do this to myself? I can go out with friends and have a beer or 2 and be fine and call it a night. I can have a couple of truly’s at home, switch to water, and go to bed at a decent time. Maybe it is the wine and the depression mixed together because every once in awhile, and it’s always with wine, I go overboard like this and I hate myself for it. In the past 15 years I’ve had 2-3 therapists and I’ve asked them if I’m an alcoholic... and I’m *very* forthcoming about my experiences. Each of them have said no but that I do develop unhealthy habits when depressed. 

I pretty much haven’t left my bedroom since this happened. My boyfriend keeps popping in and asks me what’s wrong and I feel so angry when he does. I’m not ready to talk about it yet (this long winded post is my first action of actually rationalizing my thoughts) and he *knows* what happened. He *knows* I’m upset because I made an ass of myself. He *knows* I’m upset because of the drinking and I over did it again. I feel like it’s in a way gaslighting to say “I don’t know why you’re so upset” or “I have no idea what happened to make you this depressed”. 

I’m officially cutting out wine forever. 

I guess that’s my story. I really look forward to reading more stories and getting to know you all.",1,0

Alcohol is that one friend who makes your family and all the rest of your friends say ""why the hell do you hang out with him?""

And you're constantly making excuses for him. ""Oh, that fight wasn't his fault, that would have happened whether he was there or not. Oh, come on, he didn't GET ME fired, yeah he made things worse but I was gonna get fired anyway. I hated that job."" I have decided that it is time to listen to that niggling voice in the back of my head that always quietly asks ""well you'll never know if that's true, if you keep drinking all the time.""

So this is day one. I've had maybe five of those since my drinking got problematic about 3 years ago, but they were all pretty casual. The usual ""I need a break"" responses after waking up to nasty hangovers or burnt social bridges. This feels different. This is the first time I've told my friends and my girlfriend about it; half because it always felt like admitting I was quitting meant admitting I had a problem, half because I never REALLY believed I'd quit before and I didn't wanna embarrass myself in front of all of them when I fell off the wagon. This also feels different because it is entirely for me, for self betterment. I'm not doing it because I'm afraid of losing a job or a relationship, or because somebody wants me to. I'm doing it because when I imagine who I want to be in ten years, that guy isn't fat and tired and unhealthy. And he doesn't cancel social engagements to get hammered alone.

I don't know if I'll have the willpower to make this my last ""day one,"" but for now, I will not drink with you today.",7,0

Hopefully this isn't just an ego trip and it helps someone that's struggling today focus on all the things we have BECAUSE of sobriety.

So, here are the ones I'm celebrating today after 1000+ days without hangover (in no particular order):

\*\*\*\*

I woke up tired today, but also did not have a hangover. And I went to work, without a hangover. A song played on the radio that I would have heard at some club and thought was amazing, but it was trashy, and made me glad to be able to turn it off and not be drinking or smoking cigarette anymore because sobriety.

\*\*\*\*

Quit smoking like two years ago. When I quit alcohol early on I leaned hard into my cigarette smoking, but I've let that go now too. It's so nice to do something else with my work breaks now.

\*\*\*\*

My 16 month old child has started to mimic me. They picked up my allergy nose spray (closed container) and put it near their face and breathed in as if they were doing it. I was almost immediately freaked out by ""what else have they seen me do??"" and then also instantly breathed a sigh of relief because they've never seen me drink, never seen me drunk, and never seen the bad behaviors as a result of drunkenness or hangovers.

\*\*\*\*

My fitness is getting so good! I'm not really losing weight as quickly as I'd like to but I am maintaining my weight loss as I go and my mile time has gone from 19:30 in Mid-May to 13 minutes! So... that's pretty huge!

Lost about 4 inches off my waist too! Yay! Sorry for anyone not in USA who doesn't understand these measurements and has to translate into metric. Standard system is dumb but it is the one we use.

\*\*\*\*

So my abusive ex- I hate him. He is the sperm donor to my kid though so I have left an avenue of communication open which is an email address which is auto archived so that I am not triggered in the middle of my day by a notification popping up.

Anyway, my kiddo is 16 months old and we've received a total of 5 emails from the Sperm Donor during that time, and only two had to do with the child. The rest were resolution of the Sperm Donor using my credit card illegally. \*SERENITY NOW\*

Anyway, I used to obsess and check for his emails every day or sometimes multiple times a day. But I harnessed my sobriety skills and set a timeframe ""only once a day."" then I moved it to Fridays so it was only once a week. Then I moved it to the day of the month he last emailed on (the 16th). I think eventually I'll stop looking. I just hate that my ex doesn't want to be in my kid's life but that's not on me and me fretting over that person is only taking away from my life with my kid. :-)

Also- he knows where we live and could totally file appropriately through the family court system if he wanted access to this beautiful babe. I have no barriers to him trying to be a Dad, but I won't let him hurt this sweet angel which I think is indicative of the boundaries sobriety gave me.

\*\*\*\*

My house is clean! Well... almost. Instead of do or do not I do a little bit more everyday. I give myself grace when I don't get everything done I'd like to and just start again the next day. Improve a little bit more. Same goes for my yard.

\*\*\*\*

I'm hopefully going to graduate in November with a bachelor's degree. I'm in my 30s so this is quite a long journey to get here and I probably never would have if I was still drinking. It's work at my own pace so again, just doing a little bit better everyday and everyday waking up and committing to this goal is a tool sobriety gave me. I'm so grateful!

\*\*\*\*

I'm sure there are others but this is getting lengthy. Love and peace to you all! I hope Covid-19 nor any other illness comes knocking at your door.

All of my friends and family are drinkers. Now that I’m retired I would spend a lot of my summer days sitting on the deck smoking and drinking beer and enjoying nature. At 8 months sober I tried to sit on my deck the last couple days and the tears ran down my face. I miss me and the joy I had for life. I haven’t figured how to get out of this funk. I put a smile on my face and pretend everything is alright. Thankfully my wife stopped drinking around me and had quit smoking a few years ago. She is happy I’m sober. My brother is happy I’m sober.

She’s not much of a drinker - maybe 2 or 3 drinks at most. After the fights were over, I sat at the table with her and engaged in some chit chat about my dad and how he would object to having 2 beers. His reasoning: “2 beers isn’t enough to have a good time.” My dad passed away a few years ago and we had really bonded over drinking. 

As we continued on talking I began to convince myself that I could limit myself if I wanted to. That I could go back to drinking and safely moderate it; what was wrong with having one or two? I began saying that after I got back in shape I should reward myself by having a couple on occasion. My girlfriend just nodded silently. We talked for a few more minutes and then my girlfriend was ready to head to bed - I had to go to the bathroom. 

After doing my thing I looked myself in the mirror and kind of laughed. It all came to me - everything I was saying at the table was the old me talking. I’ve been sober for a year and I’ve been feeling absolutely great. I’ve bought a house with my girlfriend. We have a great relationship. My daughter is so proud that I’ve stopped drinking. My career has really taken off. I’m thinking clearer than ever before. 

Before getting into bed I told my girlfriend that if I ever speak like that again, I’d appreciate it if she reminded me why I quit in the first place. She said she didn’t want to say anything in the moment, because she’d feel like a hypocrite, but planned to address it in the morning. I’m so thankful to have someone to listen to me but also put me in my place when necessary. 

It almost got me. ALMOST! Heres to another day, month, year of sobriety!",39,0

I have posted before here, mainly when struggling (this post for example). Anyway, the move mentioned in the post didn't work out, I despised living in Canada and my partner's family even more and spiralled out of control with my drinking, called off my wedding and left the country. 

I moved back to the UK and have a new job, new partner and I couldn't be happier. We got a new dog this weekend and I was so happy I cried in the service station we were in when we picked him up. And I've been sober a year!

1) Cleverer
2) Funnier
3) Better at my job
4) Have actual interests again (music, reading, etc)

I think in hindsight the relationship incompatibility was leading me to drink but I didn't know if at the time.

My drinking brain is telling me not to say anything because then if I want to drink again and do start drinking again one day, they will question what I’m doing.

It's been a roller-coaster of ups and downs, countless badge resets, and the last solid attempt this year got me to almost 100 days, and then I celebrated.  100 days seems like a long enough time to reset your brain but it isn't.  I've been on a continuous loop for years and it's starting to break me down.  

Last night my favorite cold beer tasted sour, scummy even.  My favorite whiskey was a glass of gasoline.  I had carefully timed my drinking with my inventory so that the last drop in the house would be drank around midnight. I forced myself to drink that last bit of gas, thinking the whole time I wished I didn't *have to* drink.  I woke up a few hours later and discovered I had 2 full glasses of beer poured, both barely touched.  I poured them down the drain along with a bottle of vodka I'd forgotten I even had.  I've taken this first step a hundred times.  The one thing I've learned is that there will never be any joy in drinking.  It lets you live in your own world, but it's a world of shit.  You're king/queen of shitsville.  Even though I'm reaping the effects of a hard night today, I feel invigorated and glad it's over.  I don't think I've ever wanted it to be over as bad as I do now.  I'm tired of living life on Hard Mode and need to believe that I deserve better.  I'm glad this group exists, no one in real life even knows I have a problem.

But overall it made me think very differently about drinking.

— Overall I feel much better, especially emotionally. My frame of mind is more optimistic, I’m feeling laughter and happiness creep back into my experience, and I’m very glad not to have shameful hangovers.

— I just got a new job a couple weeks ago that is more challenging and pays twice as much. I don’t think I’d be in a state to take this on if I were still drinking.

— My cravings are fading. I really don’t have them at all unless I’m socializing.

The not-as-good-stuff:

— I thought I’d magically lose weight but I haven’t. I may have even gained a couple pounds. For some reason I’ve been craving a lot of sweets, which I didn’t used to.

— Socializing is hard. Despite what Annie Grace says in This Naked Mind, I do think alcohol made socializing more enjoyable, and I do observe others having a better time than me in social situations. Not sure what to do about this. I feel like I’m missing out and that people now see me as a dud.

— My partner still drinks to excess a few times a week and it causes me a lot of stress. I’m not sure I’ll be able to stay in the relationship this way. I’ve asked him several times to read This Naked Mind and he says he will but of course he hasn’t.

Overall still happy to have quit and will stay the course. It comes with some challenges and I may need to re-evaluate a few things but for now it’s all manageable.",11,1

I hope that's allowed here. 

I didn't really drink when I was under 21. My dad would let me have a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions, from the time I was 15. But I didn't drink with friends really ever, though we did other drugs. 

When I turned 21 my friends and I did start drinking together. And got roudy and out of hand sometimes, as you do when you're young and just starting to drink. It got to be something we did every weekend. The only plus side here is that I wasn't doing any other drugs at this time. When I was 22 I got a DUI, I blew 0.1 over the legal limit. That was horrible and shameful and I'll always have those feelings. The embarrassment and disappointment and just kind of hating myself are things I still feel in relation to that night. I never drive after drinking now, and have no qualms about speaking up when I feel people are making bad choices in this respect, I really tried to learn a lesson.

The DUI happened right after I met my current boyfriend. He is also a drinker. At that time we were drinking up to 4 or even 5 beers a night, plus going out and drinking hard liqour on the weekends, usually whiskey or gin.

When I was maybe 25 I drank almost an entire bottle of whiskey by myself at a family christmas party. I was just embarrassing, swearing loudly in front of my family and my grandma especially, crying for no reason. I had a hang over for 2 days for the first time. That was also the first night my boyfriend slept apart from me (on the couch) because I smelled like vomit. After this I stopped drinking whiskey at all, and still don't to this day.

When I was 26 my bf and I went to the wedding of one of his friends. We both got very drunk and had our biggest fight ever. We don't really fight, we disagree and argue, but never fight, if that makes sense. This was a fight. My bf threw a glass on the floor and broke it. He accused me of ""hanging all over"" one of his friends, which I wasn't doing intentionally but I do get friendly and kind of feely when I'm drunk. He was so angry and practically screaming at me. It was horrible. He apologized the next day saying he never wanted to act like that around me again, and he hasn't.

When I was 28 we were up north at a family cabin, and got to playing drinking games with some cousins. Drank so much tequila I was literally in bed hungover all day the next day. So was one of my cousins, but she started feeling better about half way through the day and was able to eat dinner with the family. Another embarrassment for me. 

Those are most of the events through my life that I can think of as really embarrassing and shameful that happened 100% because of alcohol.

Today (I'm 29 now), I usually drink 1 beer a night on a weekday. Sometimes up to 3 drinks, if I'm being really honest. It ebbs and flows, but really usually 1 drink. My bf has at least 3 beers a night still. On the weekend, I might have as many as 4 beers in a day. I might have a cocktail once a month on the weekend, but rarely do I drink hard liqour at all.

I find that I'm easily influenced by others. If people are drinking, I'm drinking too. And I'm drinking whatever they're drinking. My entire family drinks and my bfs entire family drinks. Pretty heavily, actually. But, I have freinds that don't drink and I can hangout with them all day and night and have no alcohol and think nothing of it. I think it's a habit for me, and wanting to fit in. Maybe that sounds silly. However, I do find that when I'm buzzed, I want to drink more regardless of what others are doing. I feel like I don't have a lot of self control.

In my personal life, I would say I'm successful. I'm an engineer and make great money. I bought a house when I was 24. I have 2 cats who I adore and take care of. My bf and I have a very loving, happy, and respectful relationship and I love him very much, we're great life partners. He's successful in his career as well. 

I'm not sure what else to say, or what I'm really expecting as a response. I'm happy to answer questions, if there are any. There's obviously worlds more to the events and story of my life than what's written above. I guess I'm just looking for some insight or thoughts from others to give me some new perspective. It's nice to kind of get this all off my chest, too. Thanks for reading.",3,0

We are having friends over on Friday for takeaway and drinks - that’s fine by me - I have me raspberry lemonade which I LOVE and if there is takeaway, then I’m happy. But I obviously don’t want to drink! But this is easier said than done. 

The last time I broke a booze free streak (weeks and weeks) was because someone offered me beer they’d made and when I declined they asked why - and when I explained that I wasn’t pregnant said they were offended that I wouldn’t just try it. So I tried it, the. Had about 3 pints and felt like crap the next day. The night was fun, but I did have regrets and I did feel awful at 3am, and I did piss off and pick fights with my husband. I then drank probably every other nights for the next 1-2weeks before stopping again. 

This time, our friends are bringing some more of their home brew over (new stuff) and having some of my husbands, it’s a beer night. I don’t want any, but I’m totally more than happy, excited even, at friends coming over for an evening of fun - I’m excited to have some adult company and it will be sooooo good for my husband too. But I know the “just try it” will come up. My husband is on board with me - he knows why I don’t want to and he won’t pressure me into it. Whilst he IS the guy that can try it and walk away, he is aware that I am not! 

I’m contemplating just saying I’m on antibiotics (metronidazole specifically as you really should drink on them in case you are one of the 5% that gets the disulphram like reaction when you drink with them!) because I’m not sure it’s appropriately to answer with “no thank you, if I try it I’ll just drink the lot, then have a wine chaser, be utterly twatted, maybe drop a child on their head and not wake up in the night if they need me, feel shit for the next two days and then try and stop again, which is pretty f**king hard!”

It was awesome to just enjoy the day and then drive home.

Checking in on my third day sober. Just been reading some of your posts. Hope you are having a good day where ever you are.

I wanted to talk about a thought I was having. Recently I've gotten into long walks and hiking.

It made me think that sobriety is like hiking.

Not all trails are the same, infact all of our paths to sobriety are different. Like most great hikes they have tough moments. Paths with steep inclines. Moments of easier traveling. 

In the end though you reach your destination. Sometimes that rewards you with a epic view or simply just satisfaction of completing your journey.
It's never easy on a hard hike and there are moments you feel to give up. You push on and you are rewarded.

I believe sobriety is one long hike. The view at the end isn't going to be of a mountain, valley or countryside. It is going to be the proud reflection staring back at you from the mirror of the person who got their sh*t together.

DAY 3 LETS GO!
STAY STRONG

I’m a relatively happy and healthy 25 year old male. However, it is very important that I stay mentally/physically active as I am prone to anxiety and extreme overthinking. Sometimes to the point of analysis paralysis! Busyness is the single thing that stops me naval gazing. 

I used to really enjoy alcohol for the confidence it gave me when I was young. Hangovers were rare, and at the time I found it quite hard to stop after having a couple. I wouldn’t say it was a problem, but I did enjoy drinking, and I liked to party. It was a bit of a crutch I guess. 

Nowadays, I’m the opposite and I rarely drink, I’m also very conscious of only having a couple and stopping at the buzz. I never really get the impulse to binge. The only problem is that unlike everyone else, alcohol doesn’t really relax me, it makes me feel wired. I have no interested in drinking at home to wind down, rather it’s sometimes I’d do with friends as a social thing. The next day however, I’m prone to feeling hypersensitive, anxious and blue. When I’m busy the following day however, these symptoms of anxiety are completely alleviated as I quite simply don’t have time to stew & think to myself and analyse, I just get on with life and I’m fine!

This is an even weirder bit of the story, but when I regularly drink, I almost feel more relaxed and less uptight about drinking per say, just generally more chilled out about having hangovers. When I rarely drink, I’m so uptight about noticing any little feeling of a hangover that this self awareness kind of heightens the hangover!

When I’ve asked other people about these feelings, they’ve laughed and said that those symptoms of ‘blueness, anxiety’ are universally known as HANGOVERS, and they seem totally fine with putting up with these symptoms. I’m worried that this is just another fucking thing in my life I’m overthinking, and I don’t wanna miss out on the sometimes fun nights of getting tipsy with friends. I do love the spontaneity that drinking can bring, and I do like that it gives me confidence after a while. What’s a normal hangover??

I’m so hyperaware of my drinking habit when I do drink (only having a couple, switch to gin after x2 beers, drink copious amounts of water, stay busy but not **too** busy the next day) that I’m starting to think it may be easier to just give up altogether! 

Would love your advice and I’m happy to explain my situation further, and yes, I’m a hell of an overthinker! 

Basically, am I making a mountain out of a mole hill?",1,0

I found the first week to be the worst, I’d usually only drink once or twice a week however I’d always drink more than I should on those nights. I missed having a beer watching the football but after a week or so that craving has gone away.

It’s probably too soon to say that I don’t miss drinking alcohol anymore, I know there will be obstacles to come but I feel that I’ve built up the willpower to remember why I went sober in the first place.

Tell me where you’re going, tell me where you’ve been, tell me your wins and your losses. 

Wins

my 10 mile run Saturday was amazing despite the heat! I’m trying to run at a 9 minute (or below) mile average so I can run a sub 2 half marathon and I averaged 9:12. Not fast enough, but considering the heat and humidity, I’m really pretty happy anyway. The name of the game,  fellow runners, is long slow miles in this heat. Then reap the rewards of a great endurance base come fall.  

Ive also been experimenting with running in toe separators! I’d always had low grade ankle/arch pain when I run and for a long time I assumed that’s just normal and a part of running. I’m realizing now that my big toe - partly due to a bunion and partly due to being a lot shorter than my other toes - is not carrying its share of the weight as I run resulting in an arch and then ankle that’s straining to bear the weight as I move through a stride. It feels amazing to run actually pain free.   

Loses  

Ah well pain free never lasts does it. I managed to kick a street sign with my bare damn foot (I was in sandals) trying to get my husbands attention so I could grab my mom a mask before he pulled away. Absolutely hammered it. Toe nail is purple now and it hurts to bend and walk on it. I don’t think it’s broken (whew!) or even sprained. I think it’s just tender af and I probably destroyed that nail. Hopefully I’m good to run by Monday!

Last night was the first night that I went out with my mates for a curry and then to the pub afterwards since dropping the booze (also first time since lockdown in March). This would normally be something I look forward to so much and necking six to eight pints would be the main reason why. The fact that it’s been so long since I’ve done this with my mates due to Coronavirus I thought would make it harder. 

I was the only one who didn’t drink a drop and you know what, I didn’t even mind that much. I didn’t envy the rest of the group. I still had a laugh, I still was part of the conversation, I didn’t go home early. Stayed at the pub until last orders. I have woken up this morning feeling fresh and energised. I’m not hungover and don’t have a day of anxiety and bad toilet experiences to look forward to. I’ve found it pretty easy not drinking at home but social experiences I have always found much harder when I’ve tried periods of sobriety before. Normally always cave. I have my anniversary and my 31st birthday to deal with next week. Really determined to get through both without a drink and prove I can do things that I’ve not done before. 

Just wanted to thank this sub. Been reading and finding your stories inspirational.",8,3
518,2020-07-26 01:07:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hy15k8/small_victory/,Small victory,"I gave myself the challenge to quit drinking again.  Last time I went for a few months, then started up again.  

I don’t drink as often this time around but still binge when I do.  I decided covid was hard enough without the extra anxiety drinking brings.  And like a podcast I listened to said “covid is the perfect time to quit, you’re not missing anything and won’t be tempted if your just hanging with yourself”

And this seemed like an easy plan.  Every time I go sober it gets easier and easier.  I know I use alchohol to bond and be in the moment.  I know some of my triggers now. 

Except today.  Today was hard.  I’m working every day on major house projects and trying to rest here and there but not doing well.  My partner lives in another country and we haven’t seen eachother in months.  I feel like we’re breaking up.  There’s just not much we can say to eachother when we talk daily. We opened the relationship but even getting on apps to find a fuckbuddy the guys are just horrible to have to weed through.  I feel stuck dating a guy I don’t know when I’ll be able to see and with the misery of having to start over if we decide to break it off.  And the media is hard to be around.  It’s just constant bad news.  I try to turn it off just to keep sane.  I can’t even go lift right now.  I’m enjoying not going to the gym but I usually go 4 days a week and it helps with my anxiety. 

From the outside it looks like I’m doing great.  Then I sit still and This sadness washes over me. And I’m trying to feel it and let it go, make sure I eat right and get enough sleep and self care.  But it’s just there all the time.  This isolation.  That’s what drinking and drinking friends used to fill for me. 

I miss seeing my friends.  I miss being held.  I miss the parties.  

And today was just really lonely.  I keep busy but I just feel lonely.  All I wanted to do today was just get in the pool and drink today.   But I didn’t.  I made myself take my dog to the dog park and then came home and ate crappy food.   Not the best night but I didn’t end up blitzed and won’t be hung over tomorrow.  And tomorrow I’ll feel better about that. 

There’s no fix for this loneliness.  I’m hoping to meet a guy who’s a good fuck buddy or maybe the borders will open up and I’ll be able to travel again. But things are just uncertain right now. I feel so unwanted, and covid has just shown me how shallow all these drinking friends I had from before were.   The hangovers reminded me how drinking never made things better afterwards

I’m going to get some sleep.  And tomorrow will be better.  I’ll wake up hangover free And maybe this lonely feeling will subside a little.  Sleep usually helps.  

But for today I did not drink with you.  Thank y’all for being there and sharing your stories.   I know the first few weeks are always the hardest.    I’ve got my Topo Chico and lemonade and remind myself that I just have to sit with all this and let it pass.",2,3

But once again things slipped out of control. Pretty sure this result is inevitable for me.

Done a lot of growing as a person. Identified boredom with life and isolation as my triggers.
I’ve been on and off here and the recovery train for several years.

Here’s what I have learned about my addiction so far…

-Addiction is a disease of mental state. Alcohol hijacks your most root instincts. Your conscious mind translates these into justifications. That gives the appearance of insanity. Objectively poor logic to anyone paying attention. People that shame addicts assume there is free will involved.

-It takes something outside yourself to change addiction. An object at rest stays at rest. Nobody says “maybe I should not be an addict.” Addiction has momentum. Tolerances form. Ultimately the substance becomes part of your very homeostasis. Just like breathing. And why on Earth would you not breathe?

-I used to think I was superior to the low bottoms in AA until I realized they got sober and I didn’t. My higher power has been drinking. My go to. My respite. And it’s an abusive relationship.

-Connection is the antithesis of addiction. It’s amazing how a common problem can bring people from all walks together.

-I complain about the boredom of sobriety and not having purpose. It’s becoming clear that getting and being sober IS a purpose for me.

-I’m convinced when I slay this dragon I can use what I’ve learned and my innate gifts to reduce suffering and stigma

-I’m addicted as well to the familiarity of the pain. My ego needs shame, regret, an identity, a story. Treating myself well is new and scary territory so I sabotage.

-Being an alcoholic has forced me to mature and seek solace and higher purpose in life. Something many never do… numb and complacent on the couch. I will be a better person for having been addicted",14,1

My dad is dying. He has terminal bone cancer and every day I wake up feeling broken and in a fog. Then I get up, make coffee and start my day by talking with him at our kitchen table. You see, he’s feeling ok right now. He has energy enough for short sits out on the deck and cracking jokes with friends. All I know is that if I drink even one drink I risk losing one of these moments to being hungover and too sick and ashamed to show up, and that is not ok with me. It’s just not. 

So I haven’t had a drink. I’m taking CBD in my morning coffee and meditating by listening to Marconi Union’s Weightless. I’m crying when I need to cry and I am squashing that mean voice that tells me I need alcohol because other people don’t understand me and my grief. That’s not true. They are there, reaching out. They are bringing us food and sending funds and calling in favours to help us get what we need to give him palliative care at home. They may not understand how complex my grief is or any of my family’s but that is ok. Alcohol would not change any of that. 

For years I always said that my Papa was my best friend and he is. He taught me everything I know about being a good human, including how to pick the right humans to spend your life with. The truth is, we never could fully admit that alcohol takes more than it gives, and it always asks for a higher price next time.

My answer to the question “can I get you a drink, you must need a beer?”  is nope. The price is too dear and I wouldn’t risk it for anything. 

Alcohol can always make a bad day worse. I’m glad it’s not making my days worse any more.",114,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\--

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Fast forward to today, I’m the father of an incredibly amazing 6 month old daughter who is literally the center of my universe. I do have an occasional drink here and there but the last few weeks I’ve just had no desire until today.

Wife and I got into a huge argument because we went to my sisters house to go swimming today and I forgot to pack the bottoms to my wife’s swimsuit. I initially forgot to grab them from the dryer but despite that she told me she was going to pack a different swimsuit anyways so I just wasn’t worried about it.

Well...we got to her house, I got my suit on, she put the swimsuit on the baby...come to find out the bottoms to my wife’s swimsuit is not in the bag. She literally made sure the rest of the day and the night were completely miserable. I only brought the baby in the pool for 10 minutes because I felt so bad. But she just kept making it worse and worse and worse.

I kept thinking about how things use to be much simpler and I could chase these emotions away with drinking. I also remembered how I drinking led me to laying on my garage floor, wasted, wanting to just end it all. I also looked over at my beautiful daughter and remembered how grateful I am that I didn’t die that night, I would have never gotten to meet her and be the best father I could possibly be.

I have been feeling better about work after getting back into the swing of things but I just got thrown a curve ball in the form of my mom.

My mom is wonderful but for the most part has downplayed my addiction and trauma issues. I understand why she does this so I don't get angry at her about it anymore but that doesn't mean it doesn't negatively impact me sometimes. Just this week she gave me a red wine sheet mask, which on top of work anxiety, led to some not so great thoughts I had to shut down real quick.

Today really sucked though. My mom was telling me about a book she had read. The book was about a young girl who was abused by her alcoholic step-father. What happened to me wasn't nearly as bad as the book but some of the stuff she mentioned hit too close to comfort and while I know I should have stopped her I didn't, frankly because I don't like talking about my father or the abuse at all, and now I feel really panicky and upset and unsafe and all I want is to get out of my head in the way hard liquor can easily provide.

Music is the next best thing that can sort of get me out of my thoughts so I'm listening to some now but I just, I don't know. I just really want to feel numb from my thoughts for a little.

So I started ordering beer in bulk because it saved money that way, and having it on hand in large amounts with a surplus of free time made it easier to slip into old habits of bingeing until I ran out, which had me ordering more, and that's kind of what I've been doing since the pandemic started.

Take a paper and ,,talk"" to yourself trough that paper. Actually write down thinks like ,,Hey me, it's me. If you drink today you WILL feel sooo crappy tomorrow...just let it go you won't miss a great time, instead you will dodge a bullet. It can't bring you luck if you drink today..."" and so on. Actually write it down and read it to yourself. Think what could happen, what could turn out badly if I drink today. Then throw the paper away or keep it, but reading and writing your own mind really helps with subconsciousness in my opinion.

Actually write down your concerns like: Oh what if I'm bored today when I don't get drunk?
Then answer yourself like: Oh silly you, what is boredom compared to this relaxed feeling when you wake up?

Write down your anxieties: Oh no I'm so anxious without a drink. Then think about a solution, answer yourself for example: this anxiety will only get worse when I keep drinking.

You don't need to answer all of the questions, you can rant to yourself, too.

Talk yourself out of drinking. Make the conscious decision. Brainwash yourself. Be your own interlocutor.

The exeriment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's reading was about how tolerance. When I was drinking, I was one of those people who thought it was a good thing to have a high tolerance for alcohol. It meant I could drink more. However, this just lead to me drinking faster so I could feel the effects sooner like I use to be able to when I first started. 


Annie goes in and talks about the science behind each drink. At first, endorphins are released followed by dynorphin (a downer) to counterbalance the brain. This process repeats with each subsequent drink bringing overall happiness lower and lower. She points out that this is why jolly drunks could be in tears by the end of the night. On top of that, if drinking occurs daily the brain will start to prerelease the dynorphin. This is why the happy feeling people get when drinking may take longer to get to the more frequently alcohol is drank. 


Everything is still going well. I haven't really felt the desire to drink. I've enjoyed waking up earlier and being more productive.

It's really annoying. I was told there were some newcomers and I could talk to them and maybe sponsor them. I wanted to go and have fun and get to know more sober people! But everyone wants to fuck around and not wear masks. Lame.

I have an awesome zoom community but it's all based in the city an hour away, and I can't meet sober people here cuz no one wears masks!!!

Day 6/7 over. Even though I had a long list of things to do, I needed to have a good think about identity, how do I want to be, how to become who I want to be. So mostly sat down all day. Poor dogs. Tomorrow walk, for sure :D

Day 5/7 over, all good. I just get bored in the evenings, when I'm too tired to do interesting or useful stuff. My days are much fuller and more efficient, though. Yawn. Looking forward to organic market tomorrow, and buying full fat raw milk.

Day 4/7 done and dusted. Overcame anxiety and walked dogs, first time in months! (I have a big garden, though). I LOVED the summer walk in the woods. Also, head is getting clearer by the day. Looking forward to tomorrow.

Day 3/7 over. I've been happy today, and had a good day. A little anxious about my dog walking tomorrow (dog too enthusiastic and strong for me).

Day 2/7 in the bag, more clear headed than usual. I'm determined to be happy tomorrow.

I could use some advice from you fine folks. A little background: I have an almost 8 month old baby, I was sober during pregnancy and for a few months after, but then started having slip ups again. For the past 3+ years I've been sober more days then not and slip ups, while pretty immediately damning, are fairly short so things don't get REALLY bad as they tend to when my binges go on. (To be clear, my behavior during these slip ups is alarming and I have no delusions about becoming a responsible drinker, it just hasn't been as bad as times in the past).

Anyway I have been keeping very detailed journals since I was about 14 so I have dozens of books full of my writing. This has stressed me out for some time because there is some very embarrassing and personal stuff in these books over the last 20 years. My husband would never go through them, but now that we have a kid I'm worried one day he could look through them so I've decided to start the process of shredding the pages in them.

Ok on to the issue: I was merrily shredding notebooks from 8th grade, and then opened up a new one to start shredding and I saw that the dates were from the time right before my 2nd DUI about 3.5 years ago when things were REAL bad. So I was interested and started reading them and ho. ly. shit. I did not remember how bad things had gotten. The details in these entries is absolutely horrifying. I never did anything that would destroy my marriage (no cheating or anything), but I certainly hid and lied about my drinking and did several other things that were embarrassing, dangerous, and stulid. Part of me wanted to shred the pages, but I also thought it might be a good idea to keep them around to remind me every once in a while how bad things can get. But I would be MORTIFIED if anyone ever found and read these entries. I don't really think anyone knows how bad things got.

Does anyone else have journals with similar entries? How do you manage fear of them falling into the wrong hands?

Also separate but related, I plan to have very honest conversations with my children some day about how alcoholism runs in our family and they need to really watch out for this insidious drug. Maybe someday I will be far enough past these journal entries that I can let them read my personal account of what happened to get my point across. Good idea? Bad idea? Medium idea?

I would have a beer or two, but was focused on my health and diet, so I never drank more than that. 

But then I kicked my ex out of the house for using heroin and sleeping around for free drugs. I took back to drinking to numb myself. Well, it ended with me facing serious consequences and almost jail time. 

Still, I couldn't find it in me to put the bottle down. I've been trying for the past couple months to get sober. Being in quarantine with nothing to do made drinking easy. I always said I dont have a problem, I'm not as messed up as those in my court ordered support group. It's just alcohol, and I'm young, so it's only natural I enjoy a few drinks or a bottle of whiskey or two. I knew I was lying to myself. But it felt better to drink and forget my past troubles, and after a couple drinks, the lies were much easier to believe. 

There's no telling how much longer I would have made it if I didn't stop thinking that way. 

But I finally took that step and am now 14 days sober. I have been working out almost every day, and my diet has become more healthy. It's difficult to fight the nightly urges to drink, especially because I hate sleeping due to night terrors I have from some PTSD. But I am going to stick the course.

I was lurking here for a while and just now made a throwaway, because I don't want my medical history to be public.

First of all, I want to thank all of you here for sharing your experiences. It really helps me to reflect on myself and how problematic my drinking is. And I guess, I'll just share my baggage in return:

I wouldn't yet consider myself an alcoholic, at least not chronically. I had bad times when I drank excessively just to handle anxiety and depression. I also liked (past tense) to drink with friends a lot and honestly I just really like the taste of beer.

Today I realized that I don't enjoy being drunk anymore. It's not like I can get drunk enough for that anyway. I would drink 8 beers and some shots of tequila, but I can't really get the buzz. Friends keep telling me that I was drunk af, but I always think ""I wasn't even drunk yet"".

Of course I started drinking a lot in university. Partying all the time and sure it was fun. I'd go to pubs often, because I really want to socialize with people, I'm just too bad at it, so I'd just drink my beers there alone or sometimes with some friends that walk in. I actually plan on going to my favorite pub later, but I already went with non-alcoholic drinks there in the past, so it won't be too hard for me to stay sober tonight.

So that's the thing. I can not drink for days. I even stopped drinking for some weeks a while ago, after an incident I'll share in a second. That's why I thought it's not too problematic. And in comparison to other stories here, I really still think that. But maybe it's not black and white, and it's better to stop earlier than later. Because right now, I'm definitely headed towards it getting worse.

So recently, I'd say since over a year, I think I started to get more and more depressed. Then I'd drink a lot. One time after walking home stupidly drunk I fell really bad. I couldn't move for a day or two. And my face was totally messed up. Luckily no lasting damage.

Now that I think about it, this wasn't actually the first time. Oh man, I think I just suppressed so much  of this shit, because I normalized it.

So a couple of months back, I really had a bad hangover. I was feeling unwell for the whole day and then vomited some blood. I went to the ER and I told them I was drinking the night before, but all their tests come back normal. They tell me to get checked if it happens again. Then I didn't drink for two weeks and when I went back to drinking it happened again. Then I really panicked and stopped for about a month. I never went to the doctor though, because my GP was on holiday and afterwards my panic was gone.

Knowing that this is serious, I just decided to call my GP on Monday and tell them. But this time the whole story, that I drink too much and should stop. And well, that I need therapy for anxiety etc. Actually I wanted to start therapy for a while already, but put it off and then there was COVID-19.

There are so many more stupid stories, which I should have interpreted as red flags. So thank you for sharing your stories here, so I recognized my problem drinking early and that it's still easy enough for me to stop. Luckily I won't go through withdrawals (I only had a cold-sweaty night once and know how shitty it is) and I can still handle the cravings relatively well. Maybe I will relapse in some weeks, but I'll try anyway. So, wish me good luck and IWNDWYT.",1,1

Mine is a very common life story of mother abandonment + father in different town, raised by grandparents, family that binge drink on a regular basis/ any celebration, didn’t finish college but got a nice corporate job, had some great friends, all heavy drinkers and it was the electronic music era of all the As and Es, the Cs and Ks, you know it... like getting a bingo card and score almost all the possibilities. Never got to opioids or cheaper/dangerous stuff and weed is a regular since I’m 18. The heavier drinking and drug using started on my 20s. I was fortunate not to have enough cash to kill myself and managed to stay away from more addictive stuff.

The party and experimenting half of life came to a point where it led to some sort of isolation, I lacked the funds to keep on that path and general interest in life also faded. Just worked the corporate job, series, meal, bed, repeat. Like a Mr Robot episode. Career not took off.

Made an impulsive decision and married a foreigner I met on a tourist trip to her country and shortly after, a six (terrible) month experience with her moving over. She had undiagnosed borderline and bipolar disorders in a very complex new environment and with intense language barrier to learn to get by on herself. I couldn’t blame her so I was there to help and used all my resources, time and effort in helping her.

Life was really intense with her bursts of anger and frustration and both of us started a life of regular drinks every now and then, what quickly became every night. Peak was 20 beer cans or half a vodka/jack bottle a night and she would thru 3 bottles of wine. Night ends were always so miserable with either of us passing out somewhere on the house trying to get the other one to bed. She got really worse with time, including vodka on top of her bottles of wine and it was the lowest time for me. I had nothing to grasp to, she abandoned therapy and barely could keep a job.

My own lack of skills to handle the situation got both of us to grow apart and then respect went out of the window. Constant yelling the most unpleasant things led to resentment and bitterness leading her to seek refugee somewhere else, with someone else. She drained my resources until finally got the divorce and I left broke with a 20k debt pile on my head.

Life can always surprise you, you must be ready:

This second part of the story in one that starts with a luck twist.

Back from work on a regular day, shared an Uber with this joyful, bright and beautifully innocent girl that I started dating. She eventually invited me to share her place and that has been the last almost 4 years.

I have a thing about being open and honest. I must be able to verbalize and get to organize my feelings and arguments so I really feel the connection is real with my partner. Life has always proven to me this is the only path to a lasting relationship. Since day one with my Gf she has known about my failed marriage, financial weight and, specially, the heavy drinking/ weed. Still, she took me in and by that time I was still fully functional, great pay, consultant job, my own schedule, not much to complain.

Had our ups and downs between us but the downs took me further into drinking more, alone every day. I was close to start having real issues when she started taking charge of my situation. It was the tipping point for change and she demanded I counted my daily intake so at least I could see how absurd it was. (20% of my income at the time)

Keeping track (last 3years) really changed it for me. You know, everyone of us drinkers get that usual moment where our minds say, ‘its been a long time, maybe you should have some days off the booze and that’ll be fine, sure it’s easy!’ Just to one hour later hear the sound of the can opening and that taste of the first sip making all that idea a ‘maybe tomorrow’ thing, need to relax excuse.

That went on for a couple of years where a 12 can a night changed to 6, then 4. Gf then convinced me of switching to slimmer cans, 269ml ones. Remained on 4, then 3. Never really got below the 3 slim cans a night, and with the corona shit, it’s been really hard, so that that came back with the oscillating 4 to 5 cans.

Gf came to her own corona issues so demanded me to change, or else... in my case, nowhere to go. Lost my job, got a broke family but enough skills to keep me afloat, not able to afford rent. She pays me to help her with her odd jobs and I live with the bare minimum and make sure Im worth her time. The whole money + relationship issue created some distance but that’s understandable.

The last couple of months have finally screwed up with my brain somehow. Started not being able to sit for five minutes, constant restlessness, overall increase in cigarettes, weed and alcohol to tone it down, when I came to the point of not being able to read 5 pages of a professional book, the only I was asked to do.

Felt desperate, distanced from her and scared shit of what was next if I couldn’t get out of it. So she pushed me again to get moving, get to a doctor for help. Was another stroke of luck. Got a good recommendation and my first consultation. Meds for hyperactivity and Revia to cut the drinking cravings.

Wasn’t fully informed as to a longer program of having Nal and drinking/cutting, AF days and so on. Was so eager that I had the Nal and not drink in day 01. Not a great idea at first, rough stomach and vomiting days 1 and 2. Zero energy, nausea, headaches, fogginess, days 3 to 5.

Past day 5 the anxiety really fucked me. I had horrible tremors and muscle contracting urges that lasted for a couple of hours, twice in the mornings. Blood pressure went up too much so on day 7 I got to the Dr who prescribed some light dosage benzos to help get past this phase. By the low amount of alcohol that Ive had the last couple of years, I could not imagine it would kick me like this.


Well... :) this is my second weekend not drinking. Gf getting warmer and impressed by what was a totally unexpected progress. Having been a daily drinker for over 8 years, my initial idea was 3 AFdays then Nal + 2cans. That plan never came to mind since day one and that still surprises me. I have a couple of buds in the fridge as some sort of test but they remain unappealing. Even got AF beer, just in case. Same... nothing! It sure was a bumpy road to get here with all the anxiety, had five barely functioning days until prescribed some benzos, but aside the hyperactivity and eventual impairment, my mind feels disconnected from the cause-consequence that gets me drinking. This is all new and strange and weirdly exciting.

I know I’ll have plenty of triggers to test me over time but I feel like this experience has made it a lasting one to remind me I can do even what I think it was impossible to do.

All of these past days I have been reading your stories and struggles and that made me feel I could share mine. I don’t feel comfortable to tell anyone else. Without your stories, I could not have done it. 

Thank you and sorry for the huge post!!",3,2

all that to say, i went to a friends house last night for baseball’s opening day. i was determined to not drink. started with a bottle of water. my buddies asked me if i wanted a beer, and i told them not right now. then later, i went and got a miller lite. sipped it for about 30 minutes (normally, i’d have it gone in a few minutes). all in all, i had 3 1/2 of what i consider low alcohol drinks in about 3 hours. caught a nice buzz. drove home not worried about getting pulled over. slept great. 

in my head, i didn’t do anything wrong. i didn’t spend money on booze, i didn’t over do it, and i even woke up and took a day trip to colorado (a 2 hour flight). however i know i have that gene. my dad is a recovering drug addict and alcoholic. if i was rich, i bet you i would have a major problem.

My parents were putting a new roof on it. My dad was drunk. I heard the bang and saw him on the ground. I don’t remember the ambulance coming but it must have? I wrote a story about this in elementary school and I reread it recently and couldn’t believe the impact it had on me as a child. 

Another time my dad went to get my brother and I McDonalds for dinner and he left and didn’t come back. When our doorbell rang, it was a police officer. He had the McDonald’s in his hands. That was the day my dad wrecked my mom’s favorite van.

Another memory that stands out is one that affected my brother. For Father’s Day, he took dad to a baseball game. My dad got so drunk that he pissed himself and had to be walked/carried out by my brother before the game even started. 

Having these experiences in my life still wasn’t enough to implore me to stop drinking and I had to live through my own trials and tribulations. 

My dad is still alive and doing okay. But he is starving to death, essentially.  Lacking so many vitamins and malnourished due to replacing meals with beer and whiskey. He is doing better recently but has never been able to stop drinking for more than a few days at a time for decades. 

In other news, today marks 21 days! I’m so proud and happy! I have made it to 4 months before (since starting my alcohol journey at 15). I’m so excited to make it to 1 year. I feel so great lately. Keep Er Moving!

I don't remember what it feels like to be drunk, but I still have a gut reaction of fondness when I think about alcohol. I just have become better and better at realizing that fondness is a thought, not an action. It is automatic now, when I see alcohol I desire it, I romanticize it, and then I disregard any possibility of drinking it.

Through the years it has become clear to people, myself included, that this is no longer a phase but a way of life for me. I still feel guilt for the person I was, and guilt in general seems to be a driving emotion in my life which I hope to improve upon moving forward.

The truth is I wouldn't say my life has blossomed since sobriety in a conventional way. I haven't found a job I've enjoyed in my degree field these past few years and am working the same job I had in college which is frustrating. The great thing about sobriety though, is even when you feel like you are spinning your wheels, you're still having authentic experiences, and a clear mind to reflect on the past and plan for the future. I have an underlying faith that if I trust the process, stay sober, and continue to put my best foot forward, things will line up for me in some areas of my life that I feel they have not yet. At the same time I realize the inadequacies I feel generally come from looking outwards and comparing my ""success"" to others. When I look inwards though, I feel more and more comfortable with who I am as time goes on. I can't put a price on that internal tranquility.

Before we left I was vomiting bile and at some point some blood. My throat stung from the amount of acid that came up. I tried to drink and eat but everything immediately came back up.

The lowest point of the day had to be when I accidentally threw up on myself in the middle of the drive. (After already throwing up along the way to start.)

So there I am. Miserable. Head pounding. Body aching. Covered in my own vomit. I had no choice but to undress and wipe everything from me. But I’m in a car so now my seat and me smell disgusting.

I recovered as the hours passed and was better by the evening, still in the car. My boyfriend told me how upset he had been because he wanted to spend most of his time with him family instead he had to deal with me. He mentioned how mad he had been that but he would get over it in the morning. He also said if the roles were reversed, I would be livid.

I’ve had a problem with alcohol. It grew into one the older I got. (I’m 24 now.) I’ve drank as early as 10:00 in the morning before work. I’ve drank during breaks at work, and especially after. Honestly at some point, I just drank to numb myself and get messed up. I started hating who I was becoming and just kept drinking. But the countless nights and days I spent hungover and vomiting always followed. And honestly other drugs crept up on me when I was wasted.

Today marks my first full week sober. 

Absolutely no alcohol, not even a sip. I haven’t craved a shot even when my roommate yells “SHOTS!” From across the house. I’m excited about it.

I feel clarity. I have energy. 

Everyone here says the same thing! They wake up early, they’re morning people, they find interest in other things. It makes me happy for them, and I’m grateful to feel those same things.

I have been waking up early every morning because I’m naturally a morning person. I try to take my dog out as soon as I wake up for about two miles. Lately, I’ve been more focused on my diet and exercise as well. I found being drunk makes me shovel any and every thing into my mouth. I’ve already seen the difference in just one week of what no alcohol can do to me. 

I hope to keep it up for as long as I can. Finding this thread was a blessing because I didn’t realize how much other people struggled with it as well. I’m worried because of my lack of discipline but I check this thread every day and feel motivated. It’s great to know other people are doing better. And hopefully I can post in my first year sober.",11,0

The only good thing about that day was that I didn't drink. A day turned into a week, a month, six months. Now I'm here on this beautiful Saturday morning getting ready to celebrate my first year of sobriety, actually keeping the promise that I made time and time again but dangerously failed each and every time. Never went to AA, or any type of counseling. What I did receive was a tremendous outpouring of support from total strangers. From an online forum (which I had never heard of). And it's been a lifesaver for me. Thank you to everyone here at r/stopdrinking. Never would I have thought that I could go a year without booze without professional help. I know I'm lucky that inpatient treatment wasn't needed, most people don't get that lucky. YOU GUYS HAVE SAVED ME!! And I'm forever grateful. I try to help others when they need it, and from this point on I want to be here for anyone who feels down, has a trigger that they are struggling to work through, or just needs to talk. I'm going to try to be more selfless, while still fighting my own addiction. I can't say thanks enough.

 I just set myself way back...I had it coming though. I am glad it happened because I don't think I could do it on my own really. This is hopefully rock bottom and the only way to go is up. I haven't been sober for months on end in at least 10 years. Life is going to change a ton for better or worse... 

My friends or whatever..idk..feels like I have to cut them off.. they haven't been the greatest of friends at times and have let me down a bunch of times even the night of my arrest. But of course they called when I got out. They had this uppity happy voice and I felt like they just wanted all the juicy details...idk sometimes I am mad they let me down sometimes but then again...they have helped me alot in the past and put up with ALOT of my drunken bullshit. 

Honestly I am surprised I still have people in my life..idk I feel very lonely but luckily I got good family...and I still have a good job..and I have my dog and and am still alive.and a roof over my head...I wish AA was open. This covid shit is bullshit. My mind is a emotional rollercoaster but I do feel healthy. 

I do plan to pursue passion projects in my time now that would usually be used to be getting blackout drunk or time spent hungover. I'll work on getting into shape. I'll work on my business ideas that I have my mind on and old pursuits I failed due to alcoholism and generally a whole bunch of small bad decisions that ultimately brought me to failure and my position I am now.

 I did not become like this over night. It was many small bad decisions. I was at a family get together and it was nice when there was only a couple of us. But more people showed up and my anxiety made me leave early. I know this post is just a bunch of scattered mumbo jumbo but god.damn I wish I had AA to rant to and it helps to talk it out. I will utilize my notebook and write my daily feelings and goals. 

This is the beginning of huge changes whether I like it or not. I just Know I am going to see so many new events and people show up in my life. This is like learning to walk again and live without being inebriated. I will take this one day at a time. I am thankful for this outlet and I appreciate you all. God damn a DUI is.so much money.

Gone to meetings and run screaming in the other direction. Pretended I didn’t have a problem and tried to normalize what I was doing only to have reality check me. Etc, etc, etc. 

A year ago I was drinking multiple bottles of wine per week and crushing 750s of liquor, usually vodka. My tolerance was to the point that it took 3/4 of a 750 to even feel a buzz. I drunk texted. I drunk booty called people that I’d never sleep with sober. I hurt myself. I blacked out. I smashed my face into my brick mantle and lost lots and lots of blood. It was bad. I asked for help from my psychiatrist. I did naltrexone, the meetings, abstinence, etc. I read a lot of books, thought critically, and dramatically reformed my habits and level of consumption. It’s still not zero and I still self-medicate.

This week I talked to the same psychiatrist and explained that my anxiety, OCD, and related panic and PTSD issues were at an unbearable level again. It’s not situational. I’m taking my meds. I’m going to therapy. We came up with a plan. It involves a new drug and more therapy. When I admitted to turning to alcohol in moments of acute distress I was met with a mostly neutral response. When I asked if I could take something on bad days to avoid turning to alcohol I got a big lecture about addictive substances, swapping substances, etc, etc. Other than legally and freely available alcohol, I’ve never had another substance problem. I don’t use illicit drugs. I don’t misuse prescribed drugs. 

For some reason, that all really bugged me. Sure, I’m not perfect and not totally abstinent, but I’m a damn sight better than I was and I feel like that all just got kicked aside. I have worked hard to get where I am.

I’ve been cutting way back on my drinking. Haven’t stopped completely but no longer have the desire to drink when alone. Which means at minimum 5/7 days a week I don’t touch a drop anymore.

What I’ve discovered:

I was a dull person. Had basically no hobbies. Drinking was all I did

Going to bed sober is awesome. Waking up not hungover is even better

I actually want to do things. Sitting around all night doesn’t do it for me anymore.

I've also been married for about 12 years, and I have a kid who is 6 years old. I love my kid, she and I hang out a lot and I'm really proud of the little person she's becoming. She's incredibly difficult yes, with some serious sensory issues, but I am really thankful for her and to be her father.

My wife is one of those people who just ""gets it"" when it comes to intuition and understanding other people. She has incredible insight, and a real drive to do what's right. When I met her so many years ago, she had almost crippling anxiety. I helped nurture in her a will to overcome that anxiety and now I can barely recognize it. She's a powerful person and has learned to manage that appropriately.

So why do I drink?

My personal struggle is that I'm so tired. I love my wife, we are so close, but she and I have some very fundamental issues. This started before the drinking...she has zero sex drive, she is one of those people who can just take it or leave it. I have a pretty high drive, and more importantly, a need for physical touch. I spend so much energy trying to get her to notice me. To want me.

I don't see myself as a ""normal"" guy. I do a lot of cleaning, and cooking. I busted my ass to work myself into a new career where I am paid very well. We have nothing to worry about financially. I take care of everything and every single day is a consideration of how to make things easier on my wife. But she just doesn't seem to get it...I have had numerous conversations with her about my needs and about what I see. She tells me she's going to try and work on it, but I always end up alone...and so I drink. I'm drinking now, and I see myself drinking forever...

I don't want to drink anymore. I don't want to be so lonely anymore. What am I supposed to do? I can't imagine my life without my wife. More so, I can't imagine waking up and walking to my daughters room to give her a hug, snuggles, and start the day.

I admit it has been a while since I have been in this area of reddit but I am back to share a little bit about my story in the hope it gives someone hope. I dont like revisiting age 22-28 but I feel I owe it to you guys for everything you have done for me.  My last drink was on January 28th 2018 and I owe my life to this sub and my now wife.

I tried many times to quit. I was on here constantly resetting my badge. I remember reading posts of people who had been sober for 6 months and feeling like it was impossible. “One day at a time” you said, use “I don’t drink” when asked if you want a drink instead of “no” so they wouldn’t keep pressuring, “get a hobby”, “seek therapy,” “practice self care.” These all seemed ridiculous and so far fetched at first but over the course of 6 years they all rang true. 

The thing that resonated most with me from this sub was the mental health aspect of drinking. There is the physical addiction that can be beaten (and was) time and time again with mere discipline, but the mental addiction that was a real monster to tackle. 

I don’t want to get too deep down the rabbit hole but here is some background on me (31M).

I didn’t begin drinking until age 21, was always the DD throughout high school and much of college. Extended family had a poor history with alcohol and as such my parents never had booze in the house and I can count on one hand how many times I saw my father with a beer growing up.

I had come out of long term relationship with a girl I met in college that I wasn’t mature enough to comprehend at age 22. I filled my newfound free time with the bar scene. I loved what I perceived to be the “warmth” of a bar. The drinks, the people, the stories, the “party” and of course the bartenders and waitstaff. I enjoyed flirting, staying after last call, going home or bringing the party back to my place. Life was great (or so I thought) until about 25 when it went from being fun to a spiral I couldn’t get out of. I was putting on weight, work was suffering, I was spending ridiculous amounts of money on cocaine to a) keep drinking late into the night and b) get through the workday hangovers. Alcohol went from my friend to my master and my whole life revolved around it and answered to it.

I had isolated my family and the people that loved me and surrounded myself with the wrong crowd and the wrong partners. I was miserable, depressed, and wanted out of it so badly. 

I met my wife in September of 2017 and she quickly identified my drinking as a problem. About a month into the relationship she gave me 3 months to figure it out or she was moving on. I lived on this subreddit for those 3 months and was here quite a lot that first year. 

I’m married now and life has gotten tough at times, but I know that for me, alcohol does not have a place anymore for me. It is too dangerous and my life is overall better. 

If anyone is interested in hearing more about my path or has questions feel free to ask. I owe this sub and all of you more than I can ever repay. So thanks everyone, stay strong when you can, forgive yourself when you can’t. IWNDWYT",29,0

I'm learning how to mitigate and manage my anxiety and depression but I'm more worried about how the relationship I've had with alcohol for the last 4 years is going to affect me healthwise. I worry I'm not strong enough to kick it. I had so much willpower when it came to anorexia-(sorry I know this isnt the subreddit for that) but WHY cant I have the willpower to attain that here? Why can't I use that willpower I had for pushing myself regarding eating  to STOP drinking? Why can't I use it for a better purpose than starving myself?

They asked me if I wanted some champagne, and I declined. But they were all drunk and poured me one anyway saying I definitely needed it. I whispered to one of the girls that if she wanted mine she could have it because I’m “actually on meds on which I can’t drink,” and she happily accepted. I still had a great time talking to everyone for a bit, offered them all a ride when it was raining, and ended the night with a virtual date with my partner. 

Also, having four drunk people in your car and seeing how ridiculously these wonderful and well-meaning people behave when drunk is a really good motivator to Not Be That!

Posting here on a throwaway account is the only way I can say this out loud. And I’m still ashamed and embarrassed.

I’m a 38 year old British man, smoker, overweight, bipolar and adhd and often suicidal. 

Unemployed (had a pt job before corona hit, then I lost it) with only one immediate family member (my mum) and zero real life friends. 

I don’t eat for many days. Sometimes I’m awake for upto 72 hours and when I do sleep it’s 4-6 hours. 

I have been drinking since I was about 25ish. But normal drinking when I used to goto pubs and nightclubs. Or drinks over dinner or drinks with friends (back then I had some).

In November 2015 me and my partner lost our newborn baby. Obviously this was awful. My partner of 7 years left me.

I quit my medication and discovered the joys of wine. Started as a bottle a night, then 2. This became upto 4 bottles after a few months. Then I started abusing my lyrica medication, about 10 x 100mg mixed into the wine. Then I started with weed too.

This was the nightly routine until 5 days before my birthday my grandmother died in the care home. I then moved onto sprints, rum or vodka or whiskey. 

So nightly it was a few beers, bottle of wine and about a fifth of a 70cl bottle of spirits.

Now ah the time I knew this was bad enough but I didn’t give a damn because I wanted to die anyway and I was broken with nobody to talk to or help me. Having bipolar is enough, add in grieving for my baby, my grandmother and my relationship... and being alone. It’s too much for me.

This routine carried on for all 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. Alone at least 20 hours a day. Often in the house for weeks at a time. Spent 4 Christmas’s and New Years by myself. Christmas isn’t a thing here, just a normal week. At the start of this year my aunty died of cancer. 

So I upped my game and started buying litre bottles of vodka. I would goto the supermarket (otherwise never left house) and buy 4 litre bottles. That was my weekly quota. Plus maybe some cider or beer and a few bottles of wine.

And that brings us to today. Yesterday I woke up at 2pm. I managed 2 hours. Hands shaking, sweating. But never get headaches or hangovers. 

After 2 hours I gave in and opened my first beer. Fast forward to 10pm and it’s 3 beers, a bottle of wine. Fast forward to 6am and it’s two thirds of a litre bottle of vodka.

Now even in the state I awoke to this afternoon, I KNEW this isn’t good and it’s going to end very badly soon if I don’t do some thing. And soon. I feel weird inside. I’ve not eaten for 5 days. But at least I am taking my bipolar medicine and I drink many litres of water a day.

I’m terrified my mother is going to find me dead. I’ve passed out and hit the floor before. Woke up in a puddle of tears and cut my face on something, I don’t know what.

She knows nothing of my problem, she knows I like a drink or two but she has no idea I drink this much. I hide bottles. In my attic I have bags of bottles from years of this. I smuggle them out into my car boot so I can throw them away. I’m disgusting. A foul human.

I used to see a psychiatrist but obviously because of the pandemic I’ve not been able to see him since November now. I was going to maybe tell him this. Not sure I could do it though. It’s shameful. 

I was going to call a crisis line and say it to a random person. I can’t do it. 

It’s 11pm here (as I write this) in the U.K. and I’ve been awake since 5pm. I’ve had one can of beer and eaten some pasta.

I’m sober. And I’m hot and cold. I’m a bit shaky and bad balance. And pain in my legs from being in bed all the time.

I feel ridiculously nauseous. Getting a headache. 

I’m sat looking at 5 empty 1 litre bottles of vodka and rum. I’m just staring at them knowing this isn’t right. A moment of clarity? 

On my left is an unopened bottle of wine. I have no other alcohol. I was so close to going to the shop today to buy more vodka, panicking about only having one bottle of wine. First thing I think about when I woke up. But I didn’t goto the shop. And I’m not as bothered as I should be.

Unless it gets to 3 am and I’m all out of alcohol and I realise I have to try and sleep. Sober.

I don’t want to drink this wine. Even though deep down I know I will do but with all my soul I don’t want this anymore. I don’t want what I did last night. I don’t want to get that wasted and chain smoke, watching dumb sitcoms that I’ve seen a million times. Then pass out at 6am. Wake up and do it all over again. I don’t want this, it’s a foul existence.

I have no reason to live, this isn’t a LIFE. I can’t see how one can be built with this disease. Mental health and inability to make friends or date ever again.

I don’t know what to do or who to ask.

I just want to say it all out loud. So I wrote this. I don’t expect anyone to take it all in or understand it. Just to know I’ve said it and others have read it, that feels good.

I want to say IWNDWYT but I’m worried ill die. I keep reading it’s dangerous to just stop cold turkey. 

I should be crying writing this but my medication numbs emotions. I never laugh or cry now, just dead on the inside.

Not much else to say. Thanks for reading.",123,2

Instead of drinking I've taken up walks, gardening, cooking, and wood burning. Things I use to do before I started drinking almost daily. I've felt content with where I am and what I'm doing. I no longer have that anxious feeling or that I could be doing something more productive.

I started getting upset with myself but then I started analyzing the thought.

*“Dude, you’re just chillin, drinking your coffee and relaxing. Yea the apartment is a mess and you should probably get some errands out of the way but you’re fine. More than fine. You haven’t drank in nearly 2 weeks and you’re just drinking your coffee. 

Come to think of it, it wasn’t so long ago that you couldn’t even get out of bed in time to even make coffee before rolling out of bed with barely enough time to get dressed and swig the bottle to calm your anxiety about work. Not ONCE, for many months. And even if you could, your insides were so devastated, drinking coffee might make you puke. You are in a good place, a very good place, so don’t be so hard on yourself. Enjoy your coffee and then you can tackle whatever is bugging you. ”*

Or something to that effect. Either way it felt good. I’ve been reading The Naked Mind and it’s good to see the methodology around being mindful of your thoughts and emotional responses actually having a tangible, positive effect. It feels like in the past my coping mechanisms were not quite adequate. 

It wasn’t a hard core craving crisis or anything but those I can handle. It was one of those insidious little tertiary side effects of the alcohol addicted brain trying to pull me ever so slightly in the direction of booze - which, in the past, have been difficult to handle when you approach sobriety with a white knuckle mentality. 

Thought I’d share something. :)

I am a 27 year old gay guy who lives in a small town in Wisconsin. A close friend of mine, who is like a boyfriend to me, but we agreed to be friends for now who lives in Minneapolis and I have been hanging out a lot. To be honest, I am shocked I have not been pulled over for a DUI or done something horrible while drunk. 2 weeks ago my friend says I got black out drunk and he also came in and out of being blacked out and he had to carry me from the gay bar to the sidewalk area where an SUV full of guys pulled up and offered us a ride. They stole my iPhone and my wallet contents (left one credit card in there for some reason, maybe out of pity for me?) They stole everything from my friend. 

After having them drain thousands from my bank accounts and take over my PayPal and (temporarily) destroy my financial life I am saying NO MORE DRINKING. Alcoholism runs in my family on both sides and I simply put do not know how to stop. 

My question after that long rant is this: My friend wants to keep drinking, and that is fine because it's his body and I do not want to loose him as a friend. How do I go about hanging out with him and not drinking? Is it really as simple as going to the bar with him and saying ""I'll have a Diet Coke, nothing else?"" Anyone have pointers on how to go about the friendship? How do I say to him without sounding preachy that I am done drinking?",3,0

~5 hours later followup...
I just want to say thanks to each and everyone of you who liked or commented on my post. I’ve had a few hours to digest this.

I know that this sort of thing happens to a lot of us when we stop drinking, but this was the very first time it happened to me. Up until now I’ve been met with nothing but 100% positivity, and this felt like being punched in the stomach. 

I realize that my not drinking has obviously caused this person some sort of psychological pain… I put a chip in his “social proofing“ that drinking alcohol is fine because “everybody’s doing it“… Because everybody’s not doing it. I’m not doing it.

My journey through sobriety has been a very private and personal one, with a lot of people not even realizing the sort of alcohol problem that I had developed or that I had even quit drinking. Other than my husband, this group is a major source of support and encouragement for me. 

Thank you all for being here for me today. I’m feeling much more empowered, stronger and very proud of myself.",31,0

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here

However I am sat here about to get into a nice bath, with a cup of tea, bag of chocolates and a cold fizzy drink and I can't stop thinking:

A) Not drinking is causing my emotional eating to kick up a gear instead. I can't stop eating my feelings now I am not drinking them. I hate that.

B) I still really want that glass of wine. A big glass of red by the side of the bath was part of the ritual and a cuppa just doesn't feel the same.

2. I can't be a casual drinker. One day I'll have a beer, the next day 2, and by the weekend I'm binge drinking after my husband goes to bed. Also, you can \*still\* get a hangover from just two drinks.
3. After just a week of not drinking, I feel like me again. One night I was cooking dinner with my husband, listening to music back from high school, dancing with him and just laughing and goofing around, fully sober. I realized I hadn't seen my true self in almost three years.
4. I don't want to be a wine mom. When we have kids, I don't want to be the mom that pours herself half a bottle of wine in a huge glass to ""deal"" with motherhood.
5. I will not be able to meet my health goals if I drink. In college I lost a lot of weight, and while it was definitely due to diet and activity (I miss not having a desk job), a huge reason was because I wasn't drinking. I went to a Christian college without a drinking culture (weird, right?) despite it being one of the more liberal religious colleges.
6. It's not about ""being strict,"" it's about creating a life that just doesn't involve drinking.

I’d get a good buzz going and hit the sack. Mornings were rough, workouts were skipped. Grumpy with family. Hard to focus at work. Nothing new in that story. Got a little scare with some blood work and decided to let up on the drinking. Went 30 days, fresh blood work was well within limits. 

So I started drinking again, just with limits. Only weeKends, only on days I don’t have to work the next morning. Times when it wouldn’t impact my life quite as much. But it was still an issue, even one beer or whiskey would inevitably turn into 3. So I finally found a goal to work towards to give myself even more of a reason not to drink, I was going to a world competition for my amateur sport this summer, but due to the lockdown and virus concerns it was canned. 

So I spent some time keeping up with workouts and drinking only here and there, but boredom and lack of motivation got the best of me. I started back to weekends only, and this week I pounded a couple double margaritas on a Tuesday... woke up Wednesday and decided that’s enough. I don’t have a good relationship with alcohol, it just wants to control me, so no more. I’m done. No more just the weekends, or maybe one at the next party. I’m done with it. We can’t be friends anymore. So here’s to a alcohol free weekend. I’ll check back in on day 7.",5,3

I tell myself that since I’ve eaten the potato, there’s no point to trying to get drunk. It’ll take too much booze, too many calories, plus won’t it feel better to just slip into a food coma after that delicious potato? Before you say I’m wreaking havoc on my diet, keep in mind that I moderate my caloric intake during the day to account for the potato, and in my mind it’s TOTALLY worth it if it keeps me off the sauce.

Some thoughts.,"I first noticed something was off about me in kindergarten.  I didn't quite fit in with the other kids, I was socially awkward, I did weird shit that made people look at me strange and laugh at me.  I had one other weird friend at a time throughout elementary and middle school.  When I was 11, I started holding a knife to my wrist.  I didn't dig in because in my mind that was too easy.

All of that changed when I was 16 and I had my first spiritual experience.  I got really fucking high and melted into the couch and everything was perfect.  My head stopped telling me how much of a failure I was.  I knew I needed that all of the time.

As the connection with everything that I got that night melting into a couch got more elusive, I got more aggressive in chasing it.  Liquor got it done often, especially on top of some valium mixed with enough Adderall to keep me awake.  Looking back on this combo it was strange, as this combo made me feel level and functional, almost sober.  What I was chasing was being sober and happy at the same time.

Eventually I got to the point that no matter what I put in my system, it didn't work.   That didn't stop me of course.  I would get too drunk and high to move, be miserable the whole time, promise myself I'd never do it again, and the first thought on my mind when I came down was ""I gotta get high.""

Eventually I understood.  The magic was gone and it wasn't coming back.  So I got sober through sheer force of will.

The next eight months were the darkest of my life.  Why, if I was sober, did I still feel terrible?  Turns out the better question is, how did I expect anything else?  I was miserable before drugs and alcohol, drugs and alcohol fixed it, and I somehow expected that removing drugs and alcohol would make me feel happy?  I had never been happy.

Psychiatrists and therapy didn't work, so I was left with the choices of kill myself or try AA.  It was a hard choice, as I couldn't really conceive of a life worth living.  But I tried AA.

I approached the whole spirituality thing with the scientific method.  After all, I'm a scientist at heart.  So I tested and re-tested.  I'd listen to the AA's and try prayer and meditation, feel better, stop, feel worse, go to meetings and connect with people, stop and feel worse.  After about a year of this, I came to the conclusion that there might be something there and I stayed.  It's not perfect, especially when you consider the group dynamics, but the book is a solid idiot's guide to spirituality and happiness, and that's what I need because I'm an idiot.

So what's the upshot?  Well, I started a new job a few months ago and no one knows I'm an alcoholic, or bipolar, or autistic.  I'm just Robert.  The bad shit that happens in my life doesn't get to me as much, and I enjoy the good shit more.  I have people around me who love me and a great relationship with my family.  I saw my father off as he died of cancer.  Nothing was left unsaid and he died knowing his only son would be okay.  I have a life worth living.  If my life never got better than it is, it'd be a full life worth living.  And it's always getting better.",134,0

He said I was doing a good job, but that was it- I wasnt constantly trying to do 'more' than my current job anymore. (Back story, I started at the bottom of the company 2.5 years ago, and worked crazy hours every week and found money saving solutions to work problems and am the GM now). He recommended that I get more sleep, go to bed earlier, and eat better, and probably drink less. (At this point, he only knew that i drink a good amount, he didnt know the full extent, or that alcohol is why i struggle with those other life issues). 
I told him I could probably stand to drink less, and he told me some about his experience with drinking. He was drank every day, pretty heavily, for over 15 years. But that whole time, he was convinced it was fine, bc he worked a lot, made good money, and eventually built a multi million dollar company (hes my boss and the owner). He even battled cancer early in life. 
What ended up being the final straw was his marriage failing, and he ended up spending a month or so in rehab. 
He explained the reason he drank was 'it's an easy way to change what you are currently feeling. Feel sad? Drink'. I related with that. He told me the two big things that define an alcoholic he learned in rehab and AA was 1. You cant control when you drink. And 2. You cant control how much you drink. 
Well, I told him I had a hard time stopping after a drink or two. And I have a hard time not drinking almost everyday, to cope with stress, and calm down from the day. 
Over all, we talked a lot, and just him sharing his experience helped a lot in me wanting to stop for good. He told me that he's been where I have, and that made me feel not as alone. And seeing him be on the other side, and feeling better, more productive, happier, getting better sleep- really helped show me that I could be so much happier if I just stop drinking. 
So over all, what started as a nudge from him to take better care of myself turned into a really helpful conversation about the real reason I've been struggling.

I paid some of my necessary bills for the end of the month using the card, so I have $4 left available credit. As long as I pay everything off by the due date (8/12) I don't accrue interest and that's good, right?

Or is it better to only use like 20% of the available credit and pay it off instead of maxing it out - even if I'm paying it off regardless? That's part is confusing, but this is newer territory for me. Like, I just need someone to spell it out for me in plain English ""pay before x day, don't use 90% of your available credit, etc).

Fast forward to March 2020, I’m working as a bartender, already binging every day and getting pretty shithammered before my shifts, and then suddenly locked down at home. I can drink about a 3rd of a handle of vodka comfortably. I never get “drunk” anymore, I just pass out and am losing large chunks of my life. 

For some background, I’m a 27f living with severe Crohn’s disease that is only made worse by my drinking. I have pretty awful anxiety as well and it can make me act like a hypochondriac... especially after losing my Dad. 

Yesterday I decided I was done with alcohol. I feel like I’ve lost control of my life. I’ve lost friends, I’ve lost jobs, and now I’m losing my health. I had to go to the ER yesterday because I was vomiting so much, had horrible chills and shakes, and was severely dehydrated. I got discharged around 6 am today and I haven’t been able to sleep since yesterday. I’ve also stopped drinking easily for days at a time with no withdrawal. I’m just trying to brace myself for what’s to come or if these even are withdrawal symptoms. I didn’t tell my doctor last night that I suspected that they were because I was ashamed, and it easily could’ve been a Crohns flare up. I don’t know. My labs showed all normal numbers for my liver, and I wasn’t happy any issues with having an irregular heartbeat. My brain feels foggy and I’m exhausted. I can’t stop shaking and my skin is so clammy. The vomiting stopped though, and I’ve been able to hydrate successfully all day. My anxiety is reeling. 

I’m happy to say I’m quitting, and I’m completely determined to do it. It just seems like such a huge undertaking right now and I’m lost at how to even start.

Two years ago I decided to stop making my life worse with alcohol, and you know what? It worked. Life sober isn't always easy, but it's easier to face it with a clear head and without debilitating hangovers.

My marriage is the best it's ever been, as is my relationship with my kids. Things didn't work out with my job, and part of that was created by my drinking, but it was for the best. I'm taking up writing (my real dream job), and may go back to school.

I've replaced booze with working out, and I'm the healthiest and fittest I've been since I was a college athlete. Losing weight is much easier when you're not gorging on empty sugar calories in beer.

But in reality I was angry and miserable just beneath the surface.  

It was hard to see the humor in things when I took everything personally. (and to be fair there is some validity here because drinking does make the world a more toxic place with more people having reasons to distrust and dislike you).

I often say quitting drinking did not solve all my problems, but it did allow me to stop piling them up, making the mountain bigger.

It took a while in part because I was climbing out of the rut of a toxic marriage, a boss who had seen my limits, and a self esteem that needed considerable time in drydock.

But answer this was it a bad day or a bad 5 minutes of that day? You know how some people will say well I have this to do, Or I have to do this or that for so and so. I like to look at whatever I do in life as I get to do this for so and so.  Or I have the opportunity to do this for myself.  I ditched the ""have to's"" and I replaced it with I ""get to"". Now any miserable task I own it. I get to. I don't have to. But I get to. It paints a better picture in my head by thinking that this is my opportunity to be mindful in every single part of every single day. Other people may get mad at someone.  A coworker,  a boss, a significant other, a family member.  Asking you to do something that you don't want to do. I ditch the have and replace it with get. If it's a task that you need done it'll make you feel better about doing it.  Anyway I hope you'll have a great weekend and have time to sit and relax.

There was another dog there who had been hit by a car but was going to make it. The two women that were with him were comforting me.
All of a sudden the vet tech comes rushing around the corner with my dead dog held in one hand and flopped her unceremoniously onto the front counter, informed me that they did not in fact have cremation services, and I would have to ride home with my dead dog on my lap before rushing back. 

I nearly collapsed with grief, one woman grabbed me, the other I thought was going to punch the tech.

The kind women wrapped her gently for me in her blanket.

That image of that women never left me, and those boozy nights became less frequent but the drinking got worse behind closed doors and when it had broken me and all those around me I got the help I desperately needed and it was hard to stop, hard to stay stopped and hard to change into something else, it was hard to believe but I kept going knowing that I had met people who were like me who had been in the same place.

I was getting progressively worse, then ‘lockdown’ my gym closed which had kept my on the straight and narrow ‘sort of’ although the weight was creeping back. The boredom was horrendous with no structure to the week and I was back in the bottle! Although we could go out for essentials I’d still pop over the shop for wine, to me it was essential so we’re the fags I was back smoking and back on my bp meds.

I have been drinking heavily every night for the past 6 or so years and was able to stop for 3 months at the beginning of this year, but relapsed and things began to spiral again. 

This past Monday I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with multiple pulmonary embolisms in both lungs.. I am a 24 year old man... heavy drinker and heavy smoker. I stayed in the hospital until just a few hours ago when I was discharged and they helped me through my withdrawals as well as with the clots in my lungs that very well could’ve killed me. It was a giant wake up call... considering that although my unhealthy habits might not have been the direct cause... they certainly made it way worse as I was informed by the doctors.

Today when I was being discharged.. a social worker, middle aged lady, came up to me to offer me resources for rehab and support groups for substance abuse. I was really appreciative and then behind her mask I could see her start to cry and what she said absolutely broke me. She said “I know I shouldn’t be saying this in a professional setting, but you are my sons age. My son also struggles with addiction, and he ran away to Pennsylvania and is in and out of rehab and I never get to see him. He just won’t get better. Please get better. I really believe in you.”

And when I say I sobbed... I sobbed. I haven’t had parents for many years (both died when I was young), and it just felt like for a moment I had my mother crying to me about what I have become and for her I think she felt like she finally was able to express to her son how badly she has been hurt. It was a weird out-of-body experience... and I think it’s going to stick with me for a long time.

Negatives:

\-I miss the taste of good beer.

\-I miss that feeling of 'everything is fine!'

\-I miss not having to keep myself in check all the time.

That's it, that's all I can think of currently.

Positives:

\-I am losing weight (slowly(what a vein bastard))

\-I have more energy

\-Im doing things I enjoy like walking

\-My brain is working faster and I think there's a mild possibility I may be funny at times

\-I'm writing so much music which is something I thought was lost to my teenage years and some of it is actually quite good (I may attempt to force some it down your throats on here)

\-I am less anxious

\-I have money to spend on nice things like microphones and overpriced bread

\-I forgive myself for a lot of the misery in my past. It's not all my fault and that seems liberating.

\-I speak to family and friends more and in a real way.

\-I can exercise

\-I don't worry about having a heart attack all the time

\-I'm reading like every word is coated in gold and farted on by Her Majesty herself.

  


Wow, ok that's a lot of positives. What a cheesy man

Fuck it, I don't mind. This is good.

Whenever I have a boozy dream I take it as a sign that I need to look more closely at my sobriety. To be honest, these dreams scare me because I worry that alcohol is going to sneak up and get me someday.

I ended up quitting drinking early this year (ignore my badge) and moved back to using cannabis daily.

Don’t expect the people who are bitter with you to accept you for who you are now. I think we all have people we want to repair things with and say “look how much better I am now!”  - Often the healthiest thing we can do is let these people go. It sucks, but it’s best for everyone. 

I’ve also learned that the people you think you can count on the most have a way of not being there when things get truly tough. It’s like they don’t know how to relate to you or be in your life when it’s falling apart. 

 Brutal honesty is a bitch. But it’s better than a web of white lies that you’ve spun to avoid hard conversation. The web collapses with you in it. At least brutal honesty with yourself and others gives you an opportunity to meet this shit head on.

Bordeaux or cheap merlot, Pliny the Elder or Steel Reserve, Booker's or Ten High, they all did the job.

I wanted to check in with everyone and share how life is progressing at 204 days.

1. Professional life: I've signed up for HR classes at a local community college to support my current position and possibly move on to a new role elsewhere. My job drove me to drink, every after hours work event involved drinking, it was socially supported. Now I have clear, identifiable reasons to stay or leave rather than giving into a cycle of drinking to forget and rolling into work the next day hung over and feeling trapped. 
2. Fitness: I completed a couch to 5k training program! I still had to walk a bit for the 5k, but what matters is I trained and finished. I never thought I would be a runner, but here I am. Next I am going to move on to 10k training. I have also lost inches (weight seems stable) and I sleep better. I am trying to drink 1.5L of water a day, my diet has improved dramatically. I am trying to incorporate yoga/TRX/ weights to my regimen.
3. Hobbies: I did a pretty aggressive hike this week. The total mileage was 3.8 miles, but it was very steep, rocky, and I ran out of water at the end of it. But when I was drinking alcohol, there is no way I would have been able to do this. I would have given up before I started rather than push on and see the incredible views at the end. 
4. Mental/Health: I called a counselor today to schedule an appointment. I've been struggling for a while, many years now, but I never really got help. I just drank, further digging myself into a hole. I hope she calls me back and has availability, because I want to get help. I also am advocating with my doctor to get the physical help I need from specialists to face some ailments I've had for a while. Before, I was scared to go to the doctor, I didn't want them to ask me about my drinking habits because I was ashamed. 
5. Personal life: my relationship with my SO has been up and down, but overall improved without drinking. SO still drinks, but less so and has been very encouraging of me. 
6. Emotional: There have been a lot of things that happened to me this year that otherwise would have turned me into a mess. I had a sudden death in the family, which I could not attend to because it happened internationally, I have had conflict with my bosses, and of course, the overall fear/anxiety of quarantine life. Without drinking, I've managed to weather these storms, look at them critically, judge my reactions and come out the other side in acceptable shape. Each time something happened, I would think *I don't need a drink, I just need to handle this and move on.* 
7. Financial: Someone else mentioned how much money they've saved by not drinking and I want to second that. I am out of horrendous credit card debt, I paid off my car, and now I am building my emergency savings. 
8. The break in sobriety: It came this week when I took vacation from work. We went out of town and I wanted to celebrate and I thought ""maybe I will have one or two drinks, in a spirit of celebration rather than negativity, maybe it'll be different"". Soberfam, it wasn't worth it. I had some wine in the hot tub and all it did was make me cranky, upset my stomach to the point I couldn't fully sit in the tub, and just made me feel like I failed myself. Instead of ""starting over"" with my count, though, I am going to subtract one day from my total. I am going to see this as a speed bump instead of a failure. I made it through the rest of the trip without drinking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I want to tell you it gets better, because it's true. You will have an overall net gain from ditching alcohol if it's something you want to give up. What works for me is planning, and I recently just bought a reusable planner/notebook to help me continue grinding out my goals. I've found this method helps me focus on small goals that build up my daily, weekly, and annual goals. 

Be kind to yourself.

Most evenings over the past year have involved 5 or so pours of whiskey, a habit I thought I had under control but quickly realized was controlling me. Covid certainly hasn’t been a help. Would stop for a couple of days at a time but have that gnawing question “when will I drink again?” I also found it affect my sleep when I would stop. So.. I would start again.

Finally made the decision to quit 12 days ago. It’s been amazing. I’ve felt free, hopeful, and “unstuck.” Despite an anxiety flare up for a few days, some appetite screwery, and a new sweet tooth, it hasn’t been that bad. Except... my sleep. I’m finding myself having trouble getting to sleep some nights, and on most, waking up all. the. time.

Today's chapter was about the power of belief. I've spent my 20s conditioning myself that I ""need"" alcohol for: social situations, to unwind, and to be creative.  Annie states, ""whether what we expect actually happens  doesnt mayyer, because we will manufacture  circumstances that deliver exactly what we expect. This phenomenon has been studied over and over again. If you expect to be miserable you will be.""

I've noticed this to be true. I went into this with a different mindset than I have in the past. I didn't expect it to be difficult, like past me has. Instead, I told myself I can do this. I listed all the reasons why I wanted to and look back on them. Now, I just need to apply this to other areas of my life as well. 

Things are still going well. I even told my sister I wouldn't be drinking and I am doing a 30 day alcohol Experiment to see how I feel at the end of it.

There are times where I don’t remember 9pm until morning, waking up in my own bed not knowing how I got there, missing items, etc. Leaving school and “growing up” has quelled this issue, but now often get extreme, crippling anxiety about what awful things I could have done or said while blacked out for hours. Though I don’t talk to my old group much, I’ve asked current close friends who have seen me in this state how I act and they all just say I’m the same, just more “loud” and talking non stop. Though I have heard this, part of me thinks that because I don’t remember some monster side comes out. I have sought therapy for both this and the regret about missed memories that I can’t get back.

Today marks 90 days of sober mornings (i.e. ninety *consecutive* 24-hour cycles of zero alcohol).  And of course, I have some thoughts I wanted to spread out into the ether:

(read in a semi-Dr. Seuss' *Green Eggs and Ham* mantra)

I do not miss:

* mornings of cloud, mornings of fog
* waking up from hair of the dog
* random body pains
* hearing whispers, here in pain
* hearing symphonies that are not there
* talking to ghosts that do not care
* feeling spiders crawl in my hair
* running to the bathroom, liquid diet
* too much noise, yet too much quiet
* feeling cold, feeling hot
* feeling warm, feeling knots
* walking and stumbling
* skulking and scampering
* tearing and moaning
* dreamless nights of loathing
* unsure of the future, forgetting the past
* forgetting who I am, forgetting the past
* forgetting the past, forgetting the past!
* forgetting at last! (sigh) urge to just crash
* lying in bed, itch/twitch/squirm/bitch
* feelings of dread, heartbeats in the red
* praying for comfort, glaring at death
* fighting for freedom, fighting from Death

&#x200B;

I don't miss any of that shit.  Now I *spring* out of bed, each morning, thankful for being alive one more day.  Now each 24-hour cycle is full of:

* Rest: nights full of vivid dreams, waking up restored, waking up feeling better than I started
* Diet: daily intermitting fasting (16:8), ideal food intake, every calorie is optimal (thanks Jocko)
* Supplements: daily multivitamin, +vitamin D, +magnesium, +omega-3s, optimal caffeine intake
* Vitals: 157 lbs!  (only time I got below 160 was on an alcohol-only diet, losing precious lean muscle mass), consistently 108/78 BP, sub-60 resting heart rate
* \+STR/DEX/CON boosts: 5K warmups, yoga, kettlebells (thanks Rogan/Aubrey), cold showers (thanks Ferriss), breath-work (thanks Wim Hof)
* \+INT/WIS boosts: 20min meditations (thanks Waking Up/Mind Hacking), reading, journaling, daily gratitudes, schooling (BSN), productive educational media (YouTube/podcasts)
* \+CHA boosts: daily bed making, clean living space, clean body, clean appearance, clean attitude, presence of confidence (totally missing before)
* Skill Focuses: fishing, gardening, knot weaving, cooking, ambidexterity-training, child-rearing, mentoring, forgiving, loving, ""compassioning"" (source: I got nothing)

&#x200B;

Finally, there's the ""giving back"" part — the part that satisfies community (*sangha*).  I got the ball rolling on volunteering at food pantries, but THIS time it's on my own, instead of being ""forced to volunteer"" by my place of work.  I look forward to CoViD-19 being a thing of the past; where we can gather again and share stories.

Have read a few posts here and think this might be a place I can get (and give) support. I've never been on reddit before. I've never asked for help with drinking even though I've been drinking daily for about 20 years. I've had a few spells where I abstained but trying to be moderate always leads to too much. I would rather drink than eat even though it causes me health problems. I do not talk about this to anyone. I know my family knows I drink ""too much"" but they don't say anything. We all pretend it is just ok.  


I really want to make changes. I am in my late 60s and don't want this to shorten my life. But I can't get control. I lie to my family and my doctors. I always tell myself I will get a handle on it ""soon."" I wish I could enjoy one drink a day and be done with it. I could even work that into a Keto diet, which I want to do for health reasons. I feel like a crybaby. Why can't I just do it? I am a person who has been successful at many hard things with dedication and discipline. I do not know why this has me hogtied.

Someone who doesn't follow the mold of what a 'good' person is. A fearlessness because they walk amongst others deemed 'bad'.
I have a deep fear of being boring, expected, or ordinary. Sometimes marriage, the 2.5 kids, the dog and the picket fence sound alluring because I feel like that's what 'good' people do but, I often find myself romanticizing train hoppers.
Part of me is afraid of sobriety because right now it just feels like a different type of prison. Maybe different guards and accommodations but I'm still stuck with me.

It’s been almost a month since my last drink and I have been drinking some NA beers - not a ton at once or not everyday, but I have been drinking them. I feel like I treat them like normal people treat beer after a long day - I’ll have one or two to relax and it does give me a relaxing feeling somewhat. 

I went to a birthday party two weeks ago where we played drinking games all night and I just had NA beer in a coozie and no one was the wiser. Honestly, between the near beer taste and the party atmosphere, it sorta felt like I was drinking. I only got a couple hours of sleep that night and I think with just the amount of carbs I drank, I sorta felt shitty the next day and kind of guilty, but logically speaking the amount of alcohol I consumed was negligible so all in all I was proud of myself for making it through that event.

I'm a long time lurker on this subreddit, which is pretty embarrassing for me to say considering I'm 20F. Growing up, drinking was never  in my face due to the fact that my mom was a recovered alcoholic. However, for this reason I truly saw it as a forbidden fruit and was always curious. I remember starting to drink when I was 13/14 with friends. We would just chug whatever we were able to get our hands on. This morning I realized I have drank at least two nights a week since the age of 16.  

I always remember being that person in high school who definitely woke up the morning after a night of drinking thinking ""f\*\*\* what did I do last night?"". Although my peers could just drink a few and enjoy their night- I was always the one who wanted MORE and didn't want to stop. I can't tell you how many times that I have had that little voice tell me I need to stop drinking completely- but I have always been able to justify my habits with the excuse of well- ""I don't drink everyday so I'm not an alcoholic!"". 

However, this year has changed that. After going through a really bad breakup in February. I started drinking every single night. Being a very petite female- I always joked that I could out drink a grown man. But it truly wasn't a joke anymore. I would wake up the next day anxious, regretful, and ashamed. More times than one I couldn't remember any part of my night & when I eventually did- I wished I hadn't. 

Recently, I haven't even wanted to drink every night. However, I realized something shocking- I can't sleep unless I'm intoxicated. This realization made me cry because I realized a few things...

 A) the warnings my mother gave me I completely ignored. I always vowed to never end up like my family members and become an addict in anyway but here I am. 

B) I have no other way to justify to myself I don't have an alcohol issue now. My body has shown me that I am chemically and physically dependent on it. 

C) I am just really ashamed for not realizing my issues sooner. I am also terrified of thinking of a sober lifestyle especially going into my junior year of college. I don't know how to even tell my friends about this without them downplaying the issue.  

This is all super long but- I really just needed to get this off my chest. I no longer want alcohol to be a main focus of my life or something I use to self medicate. I have made SO many decisions these past months, drunk off my ass, that I wish I could take back. I never thought that I would have to deal with alcohol abuse issues at 20- but here I am. 3 days sober today.",1,0

Tomorrow is four weeks for me and I feel on top of the world! Life is certainly not perfect and I have had bad times but they would happen anyway.

Thankfully though, I have not had to deal with these bad times alongside dealing with the problems that occur with addiction, to alcohol. 

How I am feeling now is that I am so happy without alcohol and I cannot think of any occasion that would be improved by me drinking. Perhaps undergoing emergency surgery without anesthetic, but even than I honestly think deep breathing would be better. 

This isn't my first attempt to quit. I've gone several months before I finally cracked. Having almost physical temptation when driving past the last open booze shop on the way home, just to drink alone and wake up wishing I hadn't. 

But this time feels different, like the first time I stopped drinking which lasted about 1 year. I look back fondly on that year, not only did I achieve so much more than I thought I was capable of, but I felt great doing it. Knowing that I was in control, setting goals and achieving them, doing things better than I did before, making people proud of me. All the things i either hate doing or can't do because of alcohol.

What I saw then and see now is that the gift of sobriety includes the knowledge of what it is like to not have control of alcohol. Or any drug. I feel empowered by this knowledge and all it cost me was to not go and buy alcohol which doesn't cost me anything either so it is a win win.

I can honestly say that I have no temptation to drink or jealousy of those that can enjoy only a small amount of it. I also dont think any occasion (birthday, holiday, wedding/funeral) will be made any more enjoyable/bearable because I have a drink. 

Mentally and physically I feel way more comfortable in my skin, which also looks nicer. I love going out, honestly being the sober guy in a bunch of drunk people is brilliant. Its human nature to 'ride the wave' so to speak. If people around you are happy you will be happy. I even have a system, don't turn up late when everyone has had more than one or two. By this point people are louder and less coherent. You need to get there early when people are still sober and wanting to make a nice vibe. If you relax and concentrate on enjoying yourself here, with the right people you will ride their merry wave. The added bonus for you of course is that it's a natural pheramone high so no hangover and healthy bank balance at the end of it.

One cautionary tale is when quitting be aware that even subconsciously I have definitely started arguments or been overly sensitive to things that happen as an excuse to have a drink.

Anyway, if anyone is there, thanks for listening! I'm going to look at a new bike because I now have some extra cash. 

TLDR.

If you want to understand addiction read 'the easy way to stop smoking (just replace alcohol/whatever with cigarettes and definitely the naked mind. 
Also please know that true happiness and the absence of alcohol go hand in hand.

The sun was warm and the pool was cold.  I'm fortunate to be away with my family but anyone who has ever vacationed with small children will tell you that it's not all that relaxing most of the time.  I got to thinking about how good a cold beer would taste by the pool.

I could have run to town to get some beer and no one would have questioned it.  Except me.

I could see beyond the perfect day by the pool, when the one beer turns to 2, then 4.  Then the whiskey enters in.  And then it's no longer sunny vacation days, but staying up late in front of the TV, drinking alone on my couch.

Glad I didn't give in.  If nothing else, this stint of sobriety has helped me to be a bit more level headed with myself.  Like, no, the pain of existence is not a good reason to drink, you just need to get a good meal/exercise/meditation/get some quality sleep.  I'm not a broken person but I have picked up bad habits in the past.  This journey is about changing those bad habits for good ones.  At least mine is anyway.

788,2020-07-23 08:59:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hwf7g6/endings_suck/,Endings Suck.,"My gramma is dying. She went to the hospital in an ambulance last Sunday, I drove 8 hours overnight, believing she wouldn't make it. She's still hanging on, but very sick. We're all sort of just waiting now. It might be today, it might take a few weeks. Maybe a month. She's very stubborn. But the end is right there, it's in our face. I spent a week at ""home,"" cleaning up her living space (she's a hoarder) and trying to visit her as much as possible with Covid restrictions. She didn't recognize me any of the times I saw her in person. She's always lived with my parents, she helped raise me. Her mental and physical health have declined steadily over the last two decades, but she's generally been lucid. There have been some occasions where she mistook me for my mom, but we always straightened it out quickly. She didn't know me at all last week. She raised me, she's cared for me since I was born and didn't know me. 

I came back to my own home, and I've called her since then. She can't hold the phone on her own, but she's eventually recognized me each time. Right before she's too tired to talk anymore. 

It feels like she's standing in a train track, and I'm a few feet away. The train is coming, we can all hear it. But I can't pull her away. I can throw her flowers and beg her to realize who I am, but she's not getting out of the way. I have this panic deep inside, the train is supposed to be there, and so is she. But I need it to stop, and it simply won't. 

When I was little, my gramma would babysit my siblings and I. We always knew she was at her wits end with us when she would say: ""I've never drank, I've never smoked, I don't know what I've ever done to deserve such naughty grandchildren!"" Years later, I drove her to a doctor's appointment. I was filling out the intake paperwork for her and asked what she was allergic to. She listed a few things before pausing and then saying ""ingested alcohol."" I nearly dropped the clipboard. ""You mean... you're ALLERGIC?? To drinking???! You guilted us into behaving with all that 'I've never drank' business!"" She just chuckled. ""Wait until you have to take care of bad kids, you'll understand."" 

I'm still sober, though there have been many moments in the last two weeks where I feel like a drink is inevitable.  I'm searching for a therapist, as lives are always messier than they look in a text post. My gramma and our relationship are both complex. I'm spending most of my time trying to wrap my brain around the entirety of it. 

Life is heavy, and if you're feeling heavy too, I'm here with you.

I'm taking the leap and I will stop drinking.,"I'm in the middle of listening to the audio book ''This Naked Mind'' and it struck me like lightning that my drinking habit can no longer continue. I am a 21 years old guy and I have been a heavy drinker since I was 17. My drinking has significantly worsened in the last 2 years, peaking in the last months. It has gotten to a point where I began seeking stimulants every single time I drank so I could stay awake and drink more, making my drinking sessions last 2 days straight before I knocked out and sleep for 24 hours, waking up feeling absolutely miserable about my choices and having every part of my body ache.

I've had realizations in the past where I knew drinking was a big problem, like when I lost my driver's license a year and a half after obtaining it because I crashed my car while blackout drunk. This was a hard time but it apparently did not hit me hard enough so that I would completely give up drinking.

I am a smart guy and I know clearly how I want my life to be, and it is not what it has become. I truly want to believe that today is a turning point in my life and that I will be able to stop drinking once and for all. I will reintegrate spiritual practice to my routine, as well as exercise, a healthy diet, discovering new hobbies and reconnecting with friends that are good for me.

I've had enough.

2) **The ""I need a drink"" voice in your head gets quieter.** I used to hear this voice constantly, for hours. First thing in the morning, whenever I went shopping, when it was coming up to the time that off-licenses close. It happens occasionally now, but not nearly as much. Some days I don't hear it at all. 

3) **Diarrhea is actually rare  and not an every morning post binge occurrence.** 'nough said.

4) **It's possible to enjoy doing things without drinking alcohol.** I'm getting back into old hobbies, I'm finding new ones. I used to feel like I'd never be happy again without drink, but this feeling faded surprisingly quickly for me.

5) **The world was always beautiful, I just couldn't see it.** I used to think everything was awful, my life was a mess and that I'd always be miserable. The only thing I've changed this month is not drinking alcohol, and already it feels like I'm looking at the world through technicolour glass. I have dreams for my future and I feel hopeful again.

6) **Money!!** I've saved so much since I stopped drinking. This week to commemorate my 30 days I ordered a bass guitar, and next week I'm going to sign up for some PT sessions at my gym. It feels amazing to have money to invest in myself again.  


It's not been an easy journey and to be honest I didn't think I'd hit 30 days, I thought this was just going to be another unsuccessful sobriety attempt. This is the longest I've gone without alcohol in 8 years, and I just want to say thank you for this sub and all of the support it's given me over the past few weeks.

Honestly, I didn't really like reading these types of posts back when I was still drinking and lurking here. I've got a lot from this sub and I wanted to give something back and hopefully help someone that's struggling.

Here's a run down. Middle aged guy, started in high school, got progressively worse throughout my life. A MILLION regrets and mistakes, etc. etc. I didn't really hit rock bottom. I didn't lose my wife, house, dog. I did have multi day hangovers. I did hide my drinking. 

At the end, I was working from home so that meant starting to drink as soon as my wife left for work and try like hell to appear sober when she got home. 

I stopped doing all the things I liked to do. All of which were outside, physical stuff. I'd just sit in front of my computer day and night, rotting away.

I didn't have an 'ah ha' moment, more of a slow ""man, you really gotta stop this"" thinking that lasted several years. Same pattern when I quit smoking. (I think the smoking ban in bars really helped too)

Nobody thought I was out of control, or at least didn't say anything. I was a happy go lucky 'life of the party' drunk. That's probably been the hardest thing throughout this past year.

Figuring out how to hang out in social engagements and not be a silent weirdo. 1st 6 months sucked. Not gonna lie. I hated parties and I hated trying to talk to people at parties but it was vapid, meaningless talk. Which, made me feel worse because I felt like I was being some kinda 'holier than thou' stuck up prick.      

These last few, it's gotten better. I can hangout and not be a debbie downer. I just had to learn to relax. Maybe that's one good thing to come out of this covid lockdown, less social engagements. heh.

Physical stuff: Everything you read here is true. First 2 weeks I didn't sleep, sweating bullets, mood all over the place. For me, the honeymoon came on fast. About the 4th week I distinctly remember walking into work one morning and thinking ""Holy shit. I feel really good."" The deep sleep came after. As soon as it came on though, it was gone. 

Bad stuff: I started having existential crisises, like daily. Sounds trivial and I guess it kinda is but I'd be on my run/walk in the park and it'd hit me ""is this it? is this all there is? wtf am I doing? I'll be dead soon, I should buy a corvette instead of putting money in my Roth"". That type of stuff. 

Biggest helpers: This sub is #1. I'd gravitate towards people similar to me and read how they beat it or failed or both, etc. etc. 2nd, Annie Grace's book This Naked Mind. Bought the audio book and I've probably listened to it 5 times. I like the practical way she lays out how addictive booze is.

Things that didn't help: Therapy. I have it 4 sessions and it just wasn't for me. Maybe it was my therapist? Who knows. I didn't try AA. Couple friends are in it and as soon as I mentioned it, they launched their program on me. Eh, I don't believe in a higher power and I don't believe that things are stronger than me. I believe that whatever mess I got myself into, I have the tools to get myself out of . Abet with help of course.

So that's it in a nutshell. Sober life isn't all puppies and rainbows but I feel like I million bucks. My weight and blood work reflect that. If you're somehow still reading this. Thanks. And thanks for everyone in this sub for helping me. If there's anything I can help with. Please let me know! :)",185,2

Work was fuckin nuts. 9 hours straight of providing in home support, no breaks (I am a social worker who provides direct support and skills training to high needs kiddos with mental illness). The kiddo was rejecting my support, ignoring me, taking a tone with me and mom.following it up with ""you know I'm joking"". Mom was in the other room crying because kiddo didn't list mom as part of their support system despite the mom being their biggest support, giving the kid whatever they want despite living on a fixed income. Mom got high on pain pills (is disabled, has a prescription) and both her and the kiddo got into a fight with grandmother. Lots of yelling and rude tone of voice. My lead is ignoring my texts but responding to the group chat. I send them a text stating that ""kiddo seems annoyed with me"" and the lead replies ""mood""... implying they're annoyed with me? I feel lost and trapped for most of the day. Usually it would be easier to deal with but today was day 7... Today was the day I was afraid I would relapse when I started on day zero. So of course it would be a hard day. God is testing me. But you know what? I still didnt drink. Fuck yeah. I had two orange Creamsicles to celebrate.

I decided that when I get one month sober, I will be throwing myself a little party.

I think the ""drink takes a drink"" is about the state you're in after ""just one drink"" where you're no longer in control, the drink is, and it wants more.

This is the scene. It's the sequel to the Shining where the kid, all grown up now and a recovering alcoholic, is talking to the image of his dead (alcoholic) father, and being tempted by the offer of a drink. Fair warning, the temptation kind of made me want a drink.

See an ad for a cheesesteak sandwich my mouth drools a little — remind myself I feel physically better not eating meat.

Get stuck on all the pepperoni and sausage pizza I can't eat — think of all the things I can. (Luckily I love veggies.)

Feel a meaty craving come on — make sure I've had enough water and snack on something safe until it passes.

Have a dream I ate a hamburger — wake up and feel thankful it wasn't real.

Feel claustrophobic at the thought of never eating bacon again — decide to continue to abstain just for today.

Worry about being judged by friends / looked at weirdly for going vegetarian — keep my choice to myself or tell them and realize they really don't fucking care.


I think maybe it was easier to learn how to deal with some of the things that come up when quitting alcohol on meat terms because there's *so* much less shame involved.

For example, I don't feel shame or self-loathing if my mouth drools over a cheesesteak. But, when I see friends having a glass of wine on TV and I feel an urge, a wash of both come over me. Putting the two together (cheesesteak habit = wine habit) makes it easier for me to deal with the latter. I get that it's just a habit now and I know I can move past it.

Dream of drinking: ""I'm hopeless. An addict. All those bad memories. I'll never make it.""

Dream of eating meat: ""LOL, brain! You're weird. [pops out of bed to make a tofu scramble and doesn't give it another thought].”

I relapsed and increased my intake quite significantly. Part of the blame, at least that I have told myself, was losing my last living parent in my last living grandparent within two months of one another. Combine that with the stress of being the sole income in the home and it's easy to understand that life has been stressful.

Last night between 5 and 9 p.m. I drank an entire fifth of whiskey. I did this in the presence of my nine month old I'm 10 and 8 year old. my significant other wisely chose to stay elsewhere for the evening along with the kids.

After she left I had a major fight with depression. there was no more alcohol in the house and I definitely wasn't capable of driving to get any. I sat alone in our bedroom crying with pistol to my head for 20 minutes. Slowly I began to realize that I was having the notion to take my own life simple because I couldn't have more to drink to help with the way I was feeling.

Today I woke up feeling somewhat refreshed. I feel resolute. For the longest I have tried to control my drinking but I realize now that it is controlling me. There is no control. To that end today is when I make my stand. I will not drink with any of you today. I will not drink with any of you tomorrow. Today I am starting the path of taking my life back.

I have always said you can't give what you don't have. I have a servant's heart and love to do for others. That said I can't continue giving up pieces of my life to something when only agony gets returned. I'm better than this for my fiance. I'm better than this for our kids. I'm better than this for me. I want to try to be more active on this form as it helped me in the past.

I set a goal of 40 days. Not catholic or anything, just seemed a little more random than 30. A month and then some. 

When I hit 40 days I noticed I felt a lot better. Though I did expect I would lose more weight from how much I was putting away it was way slower. (Down about 12 kilos 25 lbs after a year at 40 days it was like 5 lbs)

Let’s do 100. I realized I liked stringing together sober days more than I missed being drunk. I just kept going. After that it was until the end of the year. 

I think after that point I didn’t really have any more goals. I just enjoyed how I didn’t feel like a slave to alcohol. 

No longer did I only look forward to coming home to do a couple shots so I could feel it now. And then some more because it didn’t last long enough. Or maybe finish that gross flat warm mixed drink in the morning because I probably went a little too hard the night before and I’m just trying to soften the landing. 

I didn’t have to wake up worrying about what I said to who. I didn’t wake up feeling like death with my head pounding. 

I never in my life thought I would ever go a year without drinking. I didn’t think it was possible or that I’d have any desire to stop.

I’ve noticed my drinking has been a problem for years, and I’ve lost track on how many times I’ve told myself I would stop drinking. There’s been too many times where I would commit to stop, but then start again the very next day. I would lie to countless people about how I’m stopping, but then start again the very next day. So many mistakes, failures, broken promises to myself that today would be the day. I see so many people on 3rd, 20th, 60th 100th day of being sober and I’ve broke down hundreds of times wondering why that can’t be me. Why I’m so selfish, depressed, anxious to stop drinking. It seems like everyone is succeeding except for me. And I’m sorry to everyone and especially myself. I keep failing to stay sober, keep punishing myself for my deceit. 


Today, my girlfriend and I broke up. This is my third day sober. I don’t want to make it sound like I’m finally on the right path and that I’m finally doing it because I might fail again. But I’m trying really hard. I want to get better.

So since I hit my 30s i've been hit with the weirdest inability to feel ""full"", I always felt like I could eat more and getting to a point where i feel satisfied or ""stuffed"" was pretty much impossible. This made it difficult to control my intake of food.

So, it's been about a month since I quit drinking. And with it, my habit of stuffing my face while drunk has also been stopped for a month. So for the past month or so I haven't been binge eating to go with my weekend binge drinking.

When I was drinking, a friday or saturday night binge of alcohol would also include about half of a large pizza + candy/chocolate or chips if I was feeling it. It wasnt uncommon for me to buy a large pizza and eat half one night and half the next day by lunch.

Today i went out for sushi with a friend. I had... maybe a little more than half of the stuff I'd normally eat on such an outing. I was actually worried while ordering it that it wouldnt be enough food. an order of california rolls (6 of em), a half order of tempura shrimp, and some takoyaki that I shared with my friend.

I. Am. Stuffed. I am actually, fully, filled to the brim FULL. Laying on my bed, falling helplessly asleep due to the amount of fullness full. I even had a very light lunch containing only vegetables, and was markedly hungry entering the restaurant.

Now, I'm full. On an amount of food that would scarcely feel like a full meal a month ago.

I was sober for a year and 8 months and chose to drink again. I have blacked out a few times and each time I have woken up with my boyfriend saying we had sex. I don’t recall it at all and it makes me feel disgusting. He tells me I consented and asked if I’m “sure” and I initiate sex.

I feel horrible, violated, disgusting, and a pos. My boyfriend explains I’m so coherent in a “black out” it’s hard to tell exactly how drunk I am and can’t identify if I black out. It makes him uncomfortable too and I can see he doesn’t like it when I tell him I don’t remember consenting or the sex at all.

I made a rule after the first time it happened “no sex if we are drunk” but of course when we do get drunk, we forget the rules and just do whatever.

Now idk what to do. Today seems like the last straw after waking up.. I woke up to blood stains all over my sheets and blanket (on my period). My clothes were off and I was so confused. I got in a fight with my boyfriend about it because I now have blood stains all over my white sheets and I don’t recall sex. I feel alcohol is gonna destroy our relationship and trust.

I don’t think a normal drinker would black out as much as I do or have this consistent problem occurring when it comes to alcohol. This experience is motivating me to sober up again but idk if I’m capable of sobering up again. It’d be hard to quit with how much my boyfriend drinks also. I just feel lost and I miss my sobriety",5,0

I was gonna write a wall of text, but I'll try to make this short.","So many stops and starts. So many attempts at moderation. Excuses, denial, lies, and deceptions. I finally quit 2 years ago and haven't had a drop since.

I was a hard drinker since I was 16. Life of the party. Popular bartender. Overall rager. A pretty funny guy who maintained friendships, girlfriends, and was likeable. 

But like so many other stories, things began to change. I was drinking earlier in the day. I would occasionally drink alone. I would piss people off, and things were no longer that funny. I would get angry, I would black out, I would get sick, I even started having shakes and withdrawals. Everything had caught up to me after decades of hard-charging.

So three years ago I came to the sub... I would stop for a bit, but even with the support of this virtual community, it just wouldn't stick. And of course I would try to moderate and change my behavior, but I was never a moderator and so I realized I would never be one. I just had to completely stop.

I scoffed at AA, or any other type of meeting for that matter. They just weren't for me. AA was super religious, right? They'd indoctrinate me. SMART Recovery? I don't want to hang out with losers. Refuge Recovery? Really? Just walk into a room and tell horror stories? No way. Meetings weren't for me.

But then I found myself in a really bad place. I began to alienate those close to me. Friends were telling me I had a problem. My long term girlfriend had enough of my shit and left me. I had some dark days... I thought I should just end it all.

But then I thought of my younger sister and realized there was no way she'd recover from me doing something drastic to myself, and so I booked a flight to Thailand and went to rehab for a month. I told people I was going on vacation.

It was there that I finally got a clear head. The first two weeks were so hard. Like, SO HARD. I didn't even know who I was at my core, but luckily I had an amazing focal counselor who took no shit and showed me the light. Also, it was there that I realized how much I actually enjoyed... Like ENJOYED meetings. It wasn't AA based, but meetings nonetheless. 

I got home and immediately began to go to Refuge Recovery and got very involved. I loved it. I ran meetings, I met people, and I realized just how NOT unique mine were. I found a community of like-minded people.

And now here I sit two years later, sober, living with my girlfriend who barely drinks and I even have a dog. Life is really good.

So to those of you who are new... Believe me, it gets better. The first 6 months are REALLY HARD, but I found that everything began to coast downhill after that and life became much more enjoyable and easier to maintain sobriety. It became my new normal.

So what are my words of wisdom? I don't have many but there is one big thing: Abstinence and recovery are two very different things. In both of them, sure... You're not drinking and that's great. But with just abstinence I don't believe that long-term sobriety is possible, and this is where the, ""dry drunk,"" phrase comes from. Might just substitute one thing for drinking, like compulsive behaviors such as shopping or gambling or pornography or whatever else... But recovery means that one has filled their gaps with connections with others and can have a fulfilling life without alcohol. 

Anyways, I said I wasn't gonna have a wall of text but I guess I lied. It happens. But I'll leave you with this: The opposite of addiction is not sobriety. The opposite of addiction is connection.

Best of luck out there. I'll be having some soda water and coffee to celebrate.

The exeriment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's chapter was about social life. Social events have always been a big reason for me to drink. I'm flat out uncomfortable in a room full of people. Annie pointed out that being uncomfortable in a room full of people is natural. She suggests engaging others by asking questions. By getting them talking it will be less work for me. 

I've pretty much only been around family during this experience but when I am around others I will use that technique. Plus it will be a great way to get to know people and remember the conversation and not over share. 


Being around family sober on this vacation has been irritating, but I have not drank. Normally I would turn to alcohol to handle the constant chatter of my mom. I love her, but she does not have an off switch when she is around people other than immediate family. Even if she is not drinking. Speaking with her about this is also difficult because she is incredibly sensitive. Same thing goes for my cousin and sister... so all of them together is not tolerable for me. Instead of drinking I would quietly get up and walk my dog. I felt badly because i spent more time away from the group then with them. However, staying alcohol free is important to me.

This is one of the hardest day’s of my life.

I didn’t feel any pain but I just felt drained of any energy to fight back and get up, I just wanted to lay there. Someone or something LITERALLY lifted me up under my arms and helped me to my feet, as long as I remember. No one was there that helped me up. I ran to the hospital with a collapsed lung, 3 stab wounds to the top of my skull, a wound that just missed my spinal cord and all over my body. I ran 3 blocks to the hospital. I collapsed right in the emergency entrance, I didn’t have it in me anymore to run. I laid there and just wanted to sleep. I woke up in an operating room being stitched and had many nurses and doctors around me, I panicked and tried to sit up. They pushed me back down and told me not to move, I’m extremely injured. I passed back out again, woke up in the morning. Finally realizing that wasn’t a dream and I’m really here. Ever since that day, my life hasn’t been the same. I have severe PTSD, anxiety, depression and I’ve been diagnosed with them shortly after that incident.

After self-medicating with alcohol for the first few months of the pandemic, I decided to take July off from drinking.

But lately, I’m questioning my relationship with weed. I’ve definitely leaned on it to help make the transition away from alcohol easier, and while I know that kind of coping mechanism isn’t super healthy, I also feel it’s much less harmful than my relationship with alcohol. 

A big part of me feels like I can’t give up *every* one of my treats or vices or methods of escapism. Plus, it’s probably the only thing saving my libido, which essentially vanished after I started taking antidepressants a year ago. 

I know there’s a support group for people who want to quit smoking, but I just don’t know if I’m there yet. I wanted to ask the denizens of r/stopdrinking: if you still smoke weed or if you decided to quit that, too, what pushed you one way or the other??",4,1

Thursday I had a few beers in the sun with friends, Friday I had a few more beers by myself, Saturday I had a lot of beer...

When I woke on Sunday, I had some beer left from passing out the night before, so I drank those beers. Well, Well, well... what do we have here? We've got a guy who realises he's so far in that he's going to have to go through the feeling of getting 'out'.

I decided to run, I didn't want to deal with the 'out', so I buried deeper...

Sunday was spent procuring booze, lovingly, but hastily carrying it back to by little boozy den, allowing the glow to wash over me. I was sat indoors with the curtains closed, if I'd gone outside I could have felt the glow, for free, from the sun.

Monday was a repeat of Sunday, with the slightly added hindrance of having to work. It's a challenge though isn't it, working when you're drunk? If you can do the job when you're pissed, you're a hero, you're tough, you're a legend.

I invented a new game on Tuesday, I call it ""6 at 6"". The rules are simple, drink the six beers you couldn't drink last night, at 6 the following morning, as fast as you can. It's a rubbish game I don't recommend it.

Stuff is mounting up at work now and I had to take my son for a tour around his new school. I got dressed up nicely, you wouldn't have guessed what I'd been up to, who I'd been cavorting with for the last 6 days. Charming as ever, I did the social waltz, smile, smile, smile...

It's 13:00 now and time to face the 'out'; off come the nice clothes, shiny shoes are put away, hair decides to stop putting on an act (much to the protestations of the expensive hair product). 

Afternoon and evening are spent grappling with angst, negative thoughts pour into my mind akin to the alcohol pouring into my mouth.

Sweaty, shaking, sleepless.

Wednesday, I wake after 3 hours of sleep, drag myself through work. There's a feeling now though, a feeling of upward movement. I'm starting to feel the edges of the ""out"", gripping tightly, I wrench the edge and then slowly float out. I'm tired, but I don't hate myself anymore, I've given myself a chance.

This time feels different for me. I gave up coffee 54 days ago after drinking huge amounts of the stuff, I knew that I'd get to 30 days off with the coffee as I was so fed-up when drinking it. I've got the same fed-up feeling with the alcohol now, something has shifted for me.

Makes me really uncomfortable and puts drinking on my mind. At the grocery store, there's overhead announcements about ""fun"" sale combinations of certain wines and liquors, which are played every 10-15 minutes or so (especially now that it's the summer). 


Little things of wine or full bottles are strategically placed near food areas. There are growlers available with craft beer at the drug store. There's apps like Drizly and Postmates that can even get booze on-demand. At the tech firms I've worked at, 100% of them had beer on tap or well-stocked fridges and team events or lunches focused around drinking.


It's overwhelming. It's things like this that make me feel like I can't escape, BUT, I have been working on paying attention to my thoughts and emotions as I am exposed to this stuff. Especially that ""day drinking, it's a thing"" sign. It has my blood boiling, because ""day drinking"" and tons of mimosas is what initially led me down a bad path to physical dependence. I feel bombarded, and I'm upset that drinking culture is so profitable/popular. How many people are high functioning alcoholics or at risk because of culture like this? It makes me sad, but also brings self-compassion somehow (""no wonder"" it's hard because the influence is all around us constantly). 


That all said, I am still learning how to recognize my urges, and I've been able to identify days when advertising may actually be enough to make me relapse. Forgiving myself when I relapse is helping; staying inside when I know I won't be able to resist buying something is also working, and helps reduce risk of spreading virus. Working remotely eliminates the tech-company drinking culture exposure as well (previously at work it was hard for me to count myself out of drinking for fear of missing out).


I want to continue to hold myself accountable. It would be so much easier if these stores/pubs/advertisers would tone it down, but I am not expecting any change, because the change has to come from within me -- the world does not revolve around me. Thanks for reading my thoughts, I really needed to get this off my chest.

But there is one thing I'd like to share after one year sober :

I'm a better person, with a better life, than I was even before I became ill with alcohol. I feel it just like other major desease 'survivors' feel : only now do I feel joyful about being alive. I've learned (the hard way) the value of life, of other people, of love, etc. This all was meaningless to the immature man I was before alcoholism. Overcoming addiction made me a much much better person. So here's the lesson I learned :
1/ I absolutely didn't need alcohol. I didn't loose anything when I quit
2/ quitting is easy. Being a drunk is hard. Awful.
3/ I'm not angry at alcohol. It eventually made me a better person. It was horrible being a drunk, but I'm not sure I'd feel in such a bliss now if It hadn't been so hard.
Now, I had to almost die to get there. You don't have to suffer like that. You can quit now. I swear, it's easy.  Much easier than such a condition.

Maybe it’s because I date, but I’m often in a situation where I feel I’m supposed to summarize my life. Account for my time, it seems. Well, I’ve never been married and have no children. I’m 18 months happily sober but basically spent 17 or so years just working and drinking a lot. So I have none of the traditional mileposts to show for my time—a divorce or two and a kid heading to college. It’s not that I think every bit of my time and life was wasted—not at ALL. I never wanted children anyway. It’s just that I feel like I have no story to tell because to drone on endlessly about your kids or ex is socially acceptable for some reason but talking about the same number of days which passed in a similarly unremarkable way only with alcohol on board seems to play as “empty.” So I have nothing to talk about really because the meaningful stuff is too heavy. Like how I ended up drinking like that in the first place—childhood trauma and loss as an adult. Things other people were simply lucky enough not to have to deal with. I wish I could just settle this so I could move on because once you get to know someone it doesn’t matter anyway. I just wish I knew how to explain my past in a way that didn’t make people doubt my sanity or worth.

Diet Coke or Soda and Lime doesn't cut it.

I've also drank the non-alcoholic beers like Heineken 0.0, but the smell can remind me too much of my past. It's a little uncomfortable for me.

I’m a new member here, I just started Annie Grace’s 30 Days No Alcohol book (started it yesterday, last day of drinking was Sunday). Obviously this is all brand new to me. I’ve wanted change my relationship with alcohol for so long but I’ve never actually done anything about it before (besides try to moderate and inevitably break those rules). On Sunday night I had a conversation with a friend where I admitted for the first time out-loud that I feel I have a drinking problem. This felt pretty significant to me, and like the first time I’ve been honest in a long time. I also felt a little bit of pride in myself for the first time in so long. This feels so much better to me already. 
My drinking was usually on the weekends, and always binge drinking. This upcoming weekend is also my sisters birthday, so normally an occasion we would drink. I feel a little weary about coming out to my family saying I’m ‘never drinking again’, it just feels like a lot of pressure. I’m thinking of just telling them I’m doing a 30 day challenge; my goal is to extend beyond 30 days indefinitely but I just don’t know if I want to get into all that yet. 
Anyways, literally as I was reading Annie Grace’s book tonight I get a call from my mom at 2am; she was clearly drunk (I get it from somewhere). It just felt like such a clear sign. I absolutely do not want to still be struggling with this when I’m 60. I’m thinking of suggesting that she try the 30 days with me, but I know other people shaming you into it never works. Anyways, all I can do is control myself and it felt like a message from the universe or something. I can choose better for myself. 
I hope everyone is doing well and if anyone has any tips for someone brand new at all this I would love to hear 😊

911,2020-07-22 04:23:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hvpzqp/dealing_with_guilt_and_ourselves/,Dealing with guilt and ourselves.,"I can't speak for anyone else, only for myself. Personally I struggle to deal with my actions drunk, as they don't represent who I am (or want to be) or what I would do sober. I also find in the aftermath of them that I am harsher on myself than anyone else. 

Even long after people have forgiven me, I still have not forgiven myself. I have trouble dealing with guilt. Someone recently suggested to me that perhaps I don't actually really love myself and this is possibly even shown through these acts of self harm and how I react to them.

I found this anecdote yesterday and it is really helping me, so I though u would share and maybe someone else may need to hear it too.

""My teacher, Swami Muktananda, used to tell a story that I think clearly illuminates the difference between these two ways of viewing ourselves. There were once two monasteries, each located close to a big city. In one monastery, the students were told that human beings were sinners and that intense vigilance and penance were the only ways the students could avoid their sinful tendencies. In the other monastery, the students were encouraged to believe in their fundamental goodness, and to trust their hearts. One day, a young man in each of these monasteries decided that he needed a respite from monastic life. Each boy sneaked out his dormitory window, hitched a ride to the nearby city, found a party, and ended up spending the night with a prostitute. The next morning, the boy from the ""sinner"" monastery was overcome with punishing remorse. He thought, ""I've fallen irrevocably from the path. There's no point in my going back."" He didn't return to his monastery and soon became part of a street gang.

The second boy also woke up with a hangover. But his response to the situation was very different. ""That was not as satisfying as I imagined it would be,"" he thought. ""I don't think I'll do that again anytime soon."" Then he went back to his monastery, climbed in the window, and was admonished for sneaking out at night. My teacher would say that when we believe that we are sinners, a very small slip can send us spiraling into a pattern of self-destructive action. But when we know, as the yoga sages tell us, that we are fundamentally divine, that we are all Buddhas, it's much easier to forgive our selves for the bad or unskillful things we do. It's also easier to change our behavior.""

Many people have told me I am a good person, but I was cliniging to bad actions I had taken throughout life and telling myself I could not be a good person because of these actions. I'm commiting to letting this belief go and hopefully by accepting that I am good and I just make mistakes, I can find the lasting change I am seeking! 

I will not drink with you today, take care 💚!

I AM on day 20, however, which is the longest I have ever gone intentionally without drinking since -- maybe ever. I haven't been checking in on here that often but tonight I had a nice, ridiculously empowering moment I wanted to share.

I was about to make some tomato soup for dinner and realized we were out of garlic, which I could easily grab from the cornerstore down the street. Of course this particular cornerstore is primarily associated with alcohol to me -- a month ago I'd been walking in every other day (alternating with another store on the other side of the neighborhood, so they wouldn't think I'm an alcoholic or anything) for whatever bottle/6-pack I'd decided to obliterate that night. Not even a second after my roommate and I decided to go pick up the garlic I looked up at her and blurted: ""I *really* want some wine. With dinner.""

She just looked at me and said, ""Do you?"" She knows pretty much everything about this recent sober attempt and how hard it's been, but she wasn't judgmental, not anything. Just said her stomach was hurting so *she* wouldn't be drinking, but it was up to me. She let me talk through the entire thing at her: how I've been realizing that store is a trigger, how I really am so close to a month and at Least wanted to get that far, how I'd noticed my boredom/time-of-day cravings had subsided, but I was still having trouble with the contextual triggers, like cooking a nice dinner for a friend. But that I also knew now that the food would still be good without wine (maybe even better), and our fridge was jam-packed with all the fancy nonalcoholic drinks I've been experimenting with. It would still be a nice dinner with a refreshing, special drink.

I'm sure it must've been a little tedious to sit through, but I'm very grateful she just sat there and listened. She didn't tell me to drink or not to, just said it was my decision and offered to go to the store for me if I didn't want to. We ended up going together and I did not even look at the wine. Back home I made us mocktails with raspberry lemonade and basil from the garden. I am not drunk now, which means I can read before bed, and I won't be hungover tomorrow.

Anyway this was a very small moment but at this stage everything feels revolutionary -- especially support from friends who I used to drink with regularly. Feeling good! IWNDWYT",25,1

Honestly, this really is the best time to quit. Fucking nothing is open (where I am in Philly) and it’s way harder to fall into old habits, and thank the sweet lord bc today would’ve tested me. 

I finally got my haircut for the first time since quarantine by an old friend from way back (a “friend” indeed, but sort of using that term a little loosely bc we were mostly party pals in the gay scene and if y’all know anything about how us queers like to party.... sheesh. A lot of black out weekends together in our 20s. Meanwhile I’m still blacking out on a regular basis in my 30s). 

His salon is in a part of town that is particularly where we used to party a lot and there’s a FUCK ton of good bars and places to get alcohol (and *other* stuff if you want). Super triggering for the “old habits die hard” stage I’m in. I truly think if it weren’t for Covid rn, my ass wouldn’t have made it to the train to head home and would’ve stopped in an old haunt for a shot + beer “just one” for olde time sake. To really say goodbye to my old ways.... and then as we all know I would’ve been there for hours until I either got cut off or stumbled out into the streets to find take home booze and continued the party there til I black out/pass out. 

I counted my lucky stars and walked past almost everything being closed or not worth breaking my sobriety streak for a lousy to-go beer if I can’t have the nostalgia with it. I felt sad for a moment but then proud by nightfall that I’m making this decision to live this way finally and made a toast with a nice cold berry La Croix.

One is a good friend who I met only a few years ago who is getting married. I'm being asked to fill out a memory card with memories of this person. I'm trying, but the problem I'm having is that so many of my good memories with this person are from when I was drinking. A lot of events together are kind of fuzzy and I'm worried I'm going to mix up memories of this friend with other friends (or worse, her fiance's exes!). My selection of memories to choose from is, unfortunately, very limited because of this, because I can't quite be sure I'm remembering things correctly.

Later in the same night, I found out a close family friend has passed away. I have known this person since I was very, very young and he was good friends with my parents before I was born. I spent some time yesterday talking to my husband about all of the great memories I have of this person, some from when I was quite young. He was a great man and will be greatly missed.

What struck me later on was just the stark contrast in my ability to recall the time spent with each person. All of the time with my friend who's getting married is from the last few years, but the memories are so fuzzy I'm having a hard time coming up with anything solid, whereas with the family friend I have so many sharp and distinct memories from very long ago. My more recent memories with this family friend, from when I've been an adult and was able to drink with him, are equally fuzzy. It's only the older memories that I can pull up with ease.

I'm so very mad at myself and at alcohol for taking so many memories from me. So much time spent with friends that I can't fully remember. It really just makes me sad and reinforces what I'm doing here. I know now that I can have a great time without drinking and I want to do everything I can to hold on to my memories of time well spent with friends and family for as long as I possibly can.",9,0

It took me quitting alcohol to realize how normalized binge drinking, and how it shouldn't be that way.

Im posting here because I recently realized that I absolutely must stop drinking. I went to the doctor for my annual wellness check last Friday. When she was pressing down on my abdomen, she could feel that my liver is enlarged. She’s ordered an ultrasound for me, which I’ll have in a couple of weeks. 

I had been “getting away with it” for years. I’m 49 now, general good health. I was putting away about 2 bottles of wine a night (sometimes less, sometimes way more) and not suffering any consequences. My tolerance was so high I barely felt tipsy. I mean, I know it’s bad for my liver and other organs, but I could only think about it in the abstract. Now it’s fucking real. 

Friday was my day 1. I’m never drinking again, period. I’ve also cut out sugar, red meat, fried anything, white flour, processed foods, sodas, at least for now. I’m adhering to a kind of clean diet and hydrating a lot. Just trying not to make my liver work too hard as I get it healthy again. But the big one is no drinking. I can never drink again. 

I think I’m going to be okay. All previous wellness checks have shown me to be in good health, so this liver thing is new. Also, I can’t feel my liver with my fingertips today, so I think it’s already starting to shrink (I’ve been mimicking what the doc did to feel for my liver and could definitely feel it right up until yesterday morning.) I’ll have to see what the ultrasound indicates, but based upon what I’ve read, odds are favorable that I can reverse it, as long as I stop drinking. 

You know what? I’m glad this happened. I’ve wanted to stop drinking for years, made several promising yet ultimately unsuccessful attempts, and now the decisions has been made for me. My liver told me, and I’d be a dumbass not to listen. 

I’m not going to spend the remainder of my years on this earth letting booze deteriorate my health until I die. That won’t be my story. Fuck. That.

Getting the drinking down to virtually nil hasn't been that hard so I guess I wasn't physically addicted.

However strangely enough getting it down from ""a couple of drinks every two or three weeks"" (literally) to absolutely zero at all (where I need to be) has been hard indeed!

I'm struggling with:

* **Not having a replacement for alcohol as a gateway towards relaxation** on the weekends
* **Not having alcohol as a reward for a really grueling stretch of work**
* **Not having alcohol to dampen down my nervous system when I occasionally douse it in far too much coffee** for its good (this often goes hand in hand with the work reason above). I used to have a drink now and again to wind me down. Sometimes, I now end my days very highly strung.

I only drank one time in HS with friends before graduation, and  on occasion with family during my early 20's. When I had anxiety/stress/mental health issues at 23, that resulted in me moving back in with my parents to finish college, I started drinking more. I went to a fundamentalist evangelical church in my early 20's that taught drinking in general was a bad behavior and to be avoided even if you were over 21. Basically I neglected personal work I needed to do in my life and mental health out of insecurity, and being suggested not to go to therapy because it could be too worldly in their solutions to my issues. Trying to go to school fulltime, work a job, and have a social life with anxiety issues, resulted in me almost failing out of college. I started drinking more when I moved in with other friends, then more when I got to my parents. Moving in with them helped financially, but they were controlling and sometimes emotionally abusive. After struggling to be stable in a social group there also I began to isolate more and drink. During this time I also developed severe skin issues, and my stepfather was in 4 stage colon cancer, I drank to curb the anxiety and discomfort. He eventually died, he saw me graduate before though, but he was still disappointed in my lack of a career. To wrap it up, I turned what was a small way to relax into a habit now.

My anxiety is down. I am 200% more productive. Quarantine has worked out well, because I can work from home. I no longer crave alcohol or have the delusion that I have fun when I consume it. But I did realize that I have been dealing with all of my life's problems by getting borderline black out drunk, passing out, waking up not knowing where I was. And for that brief hungover moment, nothing mattered. Only after an hour the memory would come back and the cringe started. Now that I am sober, I no longer have those cringe worthy memories. If I do something stupid, I know right away. But damn I miss that brief moment of nothingness. I am currently on my 11th step, and suppose to meditate, and pray in my agnostic/atheist way. But so far I'm not getting that valve release. Even with being out all day doing physical things like camping or hiking, then going home and sleeping for 12 hours. I wake up with the feeling as if I had no sleep at all. I know that booze or drugs wont fix this. But I've been dealing with life through the lens of the bottle for so long, that my brain doesn't know how to deal with it. 

Just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading.

The sad thing is 4 years ago I had lost 70lbs and spent 7 months in Keto.  I was in the best shape of my life at 31 years old.  I’ve since put most of not all that weight back on and I can’t stop.  

Last week I was able to go all week without beer but the weekend hit and I had a hard day at work, so I hit the beer all weekend.  Last night it was a 12 pack of 16oz beers.  I have to stop this.  I don’t know how to though.  

I feel that I have depression and anxiety, and virtually any stress sends me running to buy beer.  I’ve had a really stressful few years.  In the span of three years I’ve lost both grandfathers(one to pancreatic cancer) and a dear friend(bone marrow cancer), and my parents separated, divorced, and remarried.  I was placed square in the middle of that debacle and told that I wasn’t good enough to my mom during the separation.  

This seems like a rambling jumble here but it’s encouraging for me to see others with similar addiction and if they can stop, I have to be able to.  Help me figure out how!!",10,0

It has been the longest year of my life. Perhaps because I’ve been counting, or because I can feel more. 

I don’t always count but I did want to reach this milestone so I was more aware of how slowly time passed: how long a year is. 

I’m what AA calls a dry drunk. I don’t work the programme for a number of reasons.

I’ve read Rational Recovery which recommends staying away from AA because it keeps alcohol in your narrative forever. 

AA has also made a friend very religious. He talks about being trapped on a prison planet and how, when people have paid their debt, they disappear. 

Finally, I don’t work the programme because I find it hard to acknowledge I have a problem. I certainly do have a problem. I do not drink socially. I drink to escape.

I am an adult child of an alcoholic father and a codependent mother. Alcohol temporarily released me from the constant background hum of unease and self-loathing that is my legacy. 

I have made it a year by sheer willpower. There is not much I enjoy. My last post on here was about social anxiety; that remains. I went to a garden crawl at the weekend and I - endured is the appropriate word. Sobriety has at least released me from trying to moderate. 

I need to find something to replace drink and drugs to stopper that giant slow motion scream inside me, or I I will relapse. 

AA members will say this self-pity is doing a Poor Me/Pour Me A Drink; smoothing the way to a relapse. 

Sobriety has shown me how bad I feel most of the time. 

It has exposed my depression, but it has also reduced my anxiety and made me more robust. 

It has given me a platform to build on, but it’s work and I get weary. 

I’m reconnecting with my therapist and I’ll try an online AA meeting.

991,2020-07-21 10:46:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hv8llh/pinchpoints/,Pinch-points,"This is what I’m calling those moments of squeezing pressure, the nodes of anxiety that feel as though I am being twisted, compacted, ratcheted, gripped. 

Ah... a breath.  There is always relief, eventually.  I can compare this eventual relief to the “relief” offered by alcohol.  It is so different.  For one thing, the booze-relief always came with immense, aimless energy hot on its heels.  The need to do and say and be in an intense way.  And then the chase, the collapse, and the days or weeks of recovery (I am a binge drinker and the alcohol often led to elevated anxiety and depression).  This eventual relief, the natural-relief or the time-relief, is not as dramatic a shift as the booze-relief.  The pinch-points are still there, although softened.  But now a new thing is overtaking me - a warmth, a sense of pleasure at being here, touching the earth rather than being up, up, and away. 

Today a pinch-point was working itself up and I had to cancel a meeting.  I had agreed to this meeting out of a sense of obligation rather than a real desire to participate.  I knew this, and the approaching hour was provoking craven anxiety. As I was cancelling I felt bad, unreliable.  I went for lunch because I was also very hungry, which surely had something to do with how I was feeling.  Eating gave me the chance to reflect, and the grounding energy of the food helped me see things more clearly.  I had bailed, and that wasn’t great.  It was a casual meeting, and I knew no one would be terribly inconvenienced, but still. I recognized that I need to be careful, in this age of Zoom, because for a people-pleaser it’s gotten much simpler to commit oneself—much simpler too to demand things of others.  Next time I am asked to involve myself in a project (even something as small as a video chat), I’m really going to think about whether I am able and willing to commit.

So sticking with the pinch-point and not covering it up it did help, did bring some sort of clarity.  I never really know what it means when I hear the advice to “stay” with a feeling. I suppose this is because I never really know what is going to happen when I stay, what new perspectives will emerge, what encounters will reorient me.  With booze, it was more predictable (not that I noticed).  Maybe that was part of the appeal.  The irony is that I’ve always thought of myself as spontaneous and embracing the uncertain.  It’s funny how quiet and simple the spontaneous and uncertain can be.  My mistake, I guess, was always imagining that spontaneity needed to be wild, loud, crazy, and I was disappointed by what I mistook for banality.  The world is very subtle.  My pinch-point knots are subtle.  But time is a set of patient hands, undoing and redoing the knots that bind, then liberate me from each passing moment.

I'm a 24 year old woman and I've had a problem with drinking since I was 13/14. I have had phases of alcoholism where I couldn't go without night after night, but have not had too much difficulty pulling myself out of those phases. What persists is my predilection for getting blackout drunk. I suspect there's something slightly awry with the way my body processes alcohol, because I seem to be fine one minute and then a total liability the next - and I can snap out of it in about an hour if someone takes the drink off me. When I'm in a blackout state I can't really speak English - nothing I say comes close to making sense and I have on many occasions got pretty violent. Lucky I'm small enough that I've never caused anybody any harm, but I have gotten hurt before when I was younger and in a particularly vulnerable state. I never have any memories of what happened really, which I understand is common, but it's the fact that I make no sense that worries me. Many people have told me that they've never seen anything like it - and tbh nor have I. I don't just mean slurring words, I mean stringing words together in a totally nonsensical manner.

I also get super horny and inappropriate... coming onto friends and acquaintances and just generally doing out-of character shit (I'm very shy sober). I mean I'm not throwing myself at people, but I am incessantly talking about sex and telling mates when I've wanked over them, which is... something. The shame is enormous and lasts a good week, I just lie around crippled with beer fear popping propranolol and wincing when I get the odd recollection.

These events are fewer and further between these days, they happen maybe twice a year now whereas they used to happen every time I had a drink. I fear I'll just have to give up drink completely as it obviously doesn't agree with me. I feel like reaching a blackout state is something I have very little control over - it's just something that happens. I see other women my size and age drink just as much as me and sure, they get super drunk, but they just slur their words and maybe start an argument or fall over. I lose the ability to like... walk or move or speak. Why tf does this happen to me and why do I feel so completely alone in it? It's frightening and I'm desperate to talk to somebody who relates",5,0

But on some days (like today, for instance), I just wish I could meet a friend, sit in the sun somewhere secluded and drink a few beers. Socialize. 

I can, of course, do that sober. I have been drinking alcohol free beers on a number of occasions, but... you know, I just feel like something's missing. I get restless after maybe two hours, while my friend/friends are starting to feel more and more relaxed or excited.

One part of me is telling me to get of the sobriety train after I've completed a full year (that's coming up in november). Maybe I can drink in moderation now? 

Another part of me is telling me that I'm not looking for moderation. I'm looking to get so hammered that I can completely forget about the responsibilities of life for a while. But maybe a whole year of thinking quite intensively about alcohol has gotten me prepared to actually take responsibility and stop after three beers on a night out.

I just don't know, and I feel like I have this huge disappointment hanging over me as soon as I decide to drink again (if I decide to do so). I don't really have any friends who are sober either, and I've noticed that none of them are very keen on asking me about my sobriety. Maybe they're afraid to look inwards on their own drinking.

I have a thorough understanding of this: I never feel better mentally, emotionally or physically than when I quit drinking, AND when I am drinking that is never enough to get me sober again

What I’m doing with that information is taking temptation as a serious threat because.. logic doesn’t live in the drinking world. And I really, really treasure feeling this good right now.

So I intend on abstaining completely, I'm an alcoholic and addict. I just use too many things, too many WDs, I've ""quit"" before and alcohol and benzos are both the last substances I quit because of WD management. Anyways, I'll still have to keep drinking for a while (picture half a botttle 375ml of 35% ABV on average), some days I drink way more (more than half a bottle of 47% ABV gin).

Now, what's some damage control I can implement while completely stopping. I take thiamine everyday to avoid thiamine deficiency, and that has actually helped me in blood tests. I eat healthy food even if I don't eat much. I try keeping myself hydrated. I don't know how to protect my stomach from ulcers or stuff like that. I doubt sipping honey before drinking will help at all. I also take NAC and Milk Thistle for the liver, also TUDCA but I'm currently not taking TUDCA. Don't know if drinking ginger tea would also help a little bit (real ginger root). Also I exclusively drink clear liquor like gin, don't know if that's any better.

I was on vacation at my favorite place on earth, a lake in New Hampshire that my grandparents once owned a cottage on. I began taking my family there to a rental cottage several years ago to create our own family memories and what do you know...they loved it. And I'd sit there on the dock drinking beer, slowly, but surely getting drunk. There were amazing sunsets. And I was drunk. There were countless fish caught. And I was drunk. There were family photos. And I was drunk. We ate lobster and had family dinners on our porch. And I was drunk. And when I was sober by day, the irritability and anxiety (a horrible combination) owned me. I'd start thinking about having my first beer by 1:00, would struggle to make it until 4:00 (since I was on vacation it could be before 5:00) and then I'd be off to the races to begin the cycle once again.

One afternoon while we were there, my wife and I took a walk. She stopped in the middle of the road and said, ""What's wrong with you?"" I replied, ""I think I want to quit drinking. I'm really unhappy."" It was the first time I had spoken those words out loud, but I had been thinking about them for almost two years. She said, ""Well, I'd stop drinking with you if that would help (she wasn't nearly the drinker I was).""  We went home a few days later and I went to the store to buy a mixture of four 16 ounce cans of my favorite double IPAs, which was the ceremonial and official end to my drinking.

Today marks one year sober. Have I missed drinking? Over the balance of a year, I had a few phases where it was dark and cold and depressing in New England and I thought to myself, ""A beer would make me feel better right now."" Those thoughts largely occurred between December and March. After month 9, it suddenly got really easy and the thought of drinking went away. I've used a secular version of AA, which has helped. I stay connected with sober friends. We keep things light and fun. The few close friends I've shared my sobriety with also cut back or quit, which I believe is a testament to how many people struggle with alcohol. I think it's far more people than many realize. You don't have to call yourself an alcoholic to have a problem with alcohol. The shit is poison. I read This Naked Mind by Annie Grace early on. It was immensely helpful. It taught me a lot about alcohol and I highly recommend reading it.

What ultimately worked for me was a variety of tactics, including reading this sub almost daily, sometimes multiple times a day during the dark days of winter. And I can tell you I'm really grateful to have a year of sobriety under my belt. Drinking used to be the highlight of my day. Now a few moments of quiet reflection in the early morning are my favorite. Or connecting with my wife and kids. We're heading back to my favorite place on earth today for a day trip. I'm betting it will be better than ever, sitting on the dock, watching my kids fish, taking family photos. And I'll be sober as fuck.

I said I'd throw up a post when this day finally arrived, and well, here we are.

I'd been trying to give it up for a long while. It seemed I had been masking underlying depression and anxiety and was using alcohol to pull out the hooks of anxiety that were digging into my skin. I wanted to get a handle on it, and it took taking long breaks from alcohol and dealing with the depression with medication and therapy that allowed me to grow into myself as a person. The breaks started as a weekend, then I'd do a week, then I'd start with a month, and so on. But it wasn't linear. It went back and forth. But every time I started again I had a new piece of armour in my kit, and I was able to extend that time and adapt to changing environments.

A ballpark chronological timeline of stopping over the last 5 years would be something like this: a day, a weekend, a weekend again because of weekday drinking, a week, then a month, then maybe back to a week, then two months, then back to the beer, then 8 months off because if I can do two, I can do 8! Then back on it for a few years of ""normal"" use. Then last year deciding to take a break from it for a while, which turned into a year. :)

Like all of you, I used to struggle to get a day or a week strung together. I didn't want to be sober and feel all that anxiety and depression, so I just kept finding excuses to go out to the pub. Being in the IT sector it's easy to fall into that trap of cool hipster craft beer after work, then going home on the weekends to your actual group of friends and going out. The perpetual cycle.

Getting the help I needed was paramount to recovery. I had a few therapy sessions, and I was put on medication that helped me. I had a couple of years of a normal association with alcohol, until a relationship last year broke up, and I noticed myself creeping back into some old habits. Luckily, before it got destructive, I was able to put a stop to it, and started on this streak/journey that I'm on today. I think that's the power of knowing your relationship with a substance like that, and knowing when it's negatively affecting you is key.

You can go through my post history to see a chronological timeline of things. I haven't looked through it in a long time, it's some sad reading of a very scared young man.

I'm going to keep going on this streak for now, and I won't worry about tomorrow.

I really don't know what else to say. If you got this far and think you can't do it, just know that you can. Even if you're just trying to moderate give it a go.

I used to think two days was impossible, but you can do it, I promise you. I will answer any and all questions you may have.

Take care all, and don't forget to give yourself a pat on the back. The fact you're reading the sub alone shows you want to do and be better. Well done. :)

They told me theyd take my insurance and that they were in network.  Being seriously drunk and desperate at the time I trusted them, and now they're throwing a 30k bill at me AFTER insurance.  

Now, part of it is in network and a small fee for my co pay.   However the ""out of network"" is billed from a city 2.5 hrs south of here and I've never even stepped foot in.  I'm assuming this is why my insurance is considering it out of network?  I have a PPO plan that 100% covers outpatient substance abuse.  The problem is they're billing from nearly an entire state away.  

I'm considering hiring a lawyer on this one as I most definitely cannot afford a 30k bill even on a payment plan.

I was wondering about it, it has always seemed like a problem all of my own although I know a lot of heavy drinkers and substance abusers. 

  At one point it would happen like 1 out of every 3 or 4 times I drank. I could not count the amount of times it happened. 

  It caused no end of embarrassment, but wasnt enough to stop me drinking for about ten years. 

  It also directly lead to the break up with my ex-fiance. She stated this directly, she couldnt cope with this. As an extra boot, she cheated on me for several months before I ended it, essentially lining up the next serious relationship while our engagement failed. 

  Interestingly, a few months ago I had a slip up and drank a lot of tequila and passed out. I wound up under observation in hospital, and while passed out there I stopped breathing for around a minute or so, and then peed myself. Interestingly, I just googled it and there is a link between sleep apnea and incontinence.

  Just thought I should try and get this out there. I have been mostly entirely sober for more than a year, but still I think there re things I havent addressed. One is the shame of this. I suspect it will always be with me in some form, maybe I should try and do some counselling for it?",13,0

Meanwhile, this new job is a complete nightmare. Impossible expectations with standards that are 10 times stricter than the company norms. All that amongst a whole slew of other things.

I have taken this process one day at a time and that has been vital for me.

I feel different and it’s surreal spending your 20s & 30s binge drinking and not truly knowing who you really are. I was stuck in an endless cycle of self-doubt, depression and anxiety and quite honestly believed I didn’t have much worth or value- I hated myself. Quitting drinking has revealed that I didn’t hate myself; I just hated the way I always felt.

When I first posted here 100 days ago I was as low as I’ve ever been. I didn’t know what exactly I was seeking but what I got was compassion and hope from strangers. It was my lifeline. Those people saved me in a way, just by extending their compassion and understanding. Not feeling completely alone gave me the courage to seek help. 

To the people who respond and give others hope and love, you’re the real MVPs. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.",36,0

I have been drinking for over 10 years of my life and I am only 26 y/o. After graduating college and moving away from friends and family for a my career I started daily drinking. It started slowly, a beer or 2 a night of cheap ""college"" stuff. Eventually graduated to higher grade beer and whiskey/bourbon. This past year though, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to have 3-5 IPA beers and anywhere from 5-15 shots every night. Queue the waking up in the morning and feeling like death, drinking 2 cups of coffee before work to appear ""normal"" to my coworkers.

&#x200B;

I have tried quitting in the past multiple times, but by the time the weekend came all bets were off for remaining sober. Well something happened this past Wednesday and I am just done with drinking, this is the longest sober streak in at least 4-5 years (which is honestly depressing to think about). 

&#x200B;

It has not been an easy road to get here so far: I barely sleep at night averaging 3-4 hours a night, extreme reduced hunger (which is good because I am trying to lose weight, but eating a couple snacks is enough to settle me over which isn't healthy in the long run). The good news is every day is getting easier to get through. Even with barely any sleep, at least I don't have the raging hang over.

&#x200B;

Anyway everyone, I hope anyone reading this is able to overcome the struggles and stick to it. I will post an update in a week or 2 on my situation and how I am feeling doing and if relapse again this time.

I have had multiple attempts to quit drinking, as I know I'm an alcoholic and I know how it changes my personality - especially when I was sober, between drinks. It just made me a controlling asshole with a hairpin trigger. It was not healthy for my young daughter nor my new partner, nor any of my friends that still cared enough about me to excuse my behavior. I've been proud of my progress, even though I didn't track it very well. I didn't even force myself to memorize my quitting date, as that just made me crave it all the more. I just remembered it as the last weeked of April, 2019. I have regularly gotten cravings - it was the worst for the first month, but after that, the intensity went down, but has been at about the same level since. 

I had been missing the taste of beer, and was shopping at Fred Meyers (West coast Kroger's). I saw that they carried non-alcoholic beer and was happy to be able to try it. So I got a six pack of that, drank a couple, and felt a very small buzz - which I assumed was the hops. I just went shopping again Thursday night. Bought another 6 pack of Clausthaler. Drank it with my sushi that night.

Before that second pack, I had noticed I was getting frustrated easily again. I noticed a craving for the non-alcoholic beer I had. I noticed mild brain fog, and that my impulse control was getting reduced.

I decided to read the label. I then noticed that it had, in fine print, something along the lines of: ""This beverage has less than 0.5% ABV."" Meaning it still had a small amount of alcohol. The buzz that I thought was from the hops, was because there was alcohol in it; which further cemented that I shouldn't have any amount of alcohol in anything.

I gave away the rest that I had, and now have a new date of July 17, 2020. It's still a struggle. I still now crave it, but I know I can do this, due to having already achieved a year.

I just feel mildly disappointed in myself that I hadn't checked the fine print before purchasing. My partner has been more than supportive of me, and my child has told me they're proud of me for figuring it out.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and don't forget to check the fine print of your beverages.

I just wanted to firstly say that is by far the most positive, motivating and encouraging group of folks I have had the opportunity to be a part of.. ever really. It is now a daily read for me. I want to thank all of you.

Today is day 80 clean and sober for me. Although it is getting easier day to day.. It has been a difficult road to reach the 80 day mark.
About 90 days ago I had a life changing moment while working in the warehouse for one of the larger beer distributors in Minnesota.  While going through horrible withdrawal, I was on a forklift wrapping pallets in preparation to go out on the trucks the following day. Out of nowhere I suffered a seizure (which later I learned was directly attributed to alcohol withdrawal). While having the seizure, my foot slammed on the gas pedal. I ended up driving full speed into a machine and was thrown from the forklift landing face first on the cement warehouse floor. 
I ended up receiving a stage 2 or 3 concussion on top of the seizure and woke up to medics and my coworkers kneeled around me trying to wake me up. 
I was rushed to the hospital where I proceeded to lie to doctors about my drinking problem. 
After bloodwork was done I had a doctor come sit with me alone to ask a few rudimentary questions. After a few questions he started asking about alcohol consumption.  I, like usual lied and lied. He then told me my bloodwork was worrisome due to the heavy level of liver enzymes. Leading them to believe I was starting to show signs of liver damage. I brushed him off and asked when I'd be ready to go home. 
Despite the obvious wake up call.. I went home and heavily drank for another 10 days. All while dealing with extreme vertigo and ringing in my ears. I really dont know what sparked inside my brain.. but I remember a high school friend posted on Facebook about how if any of his friends ever needed help with addiction he would be there for him 
I sent him a message one morning in a drunken stupor simply saying.. ""I need help."" He sent me a message back.. ""I'll book you a room right now for detox if you're ready.."" 
About 4 hours later I was getting checked into detox. I blew a .41 when I got there. Which was after a day of normal drinking for me. 
I stayed 4 days.. dealt with almost no sleep, high blood pressure and general agony. BUT I made it through and I am now 80 days sober. And I have never looked back. 

Life has completely turned around for me. I have been hired at a new great union job. I'm there to help my mom with anything. I actually take my dog out for hikes.
I dont have to worry about talking face to face because of my vodka breath. Or not being able to eat until I have a drink to settle my stomach. I can't believe I spent almost 7 years of my life feeling like garbage, ditching friends and many possible lovers.
Although almost everyone has stopped contact with me because of how I treated them in the past.. Its fine.  I have my sobriety and at this current time.  That's more then I could ask for. 
There is always time to rebuild and start anew. 

Sorry for the long post. 
I have spent time here every day the last 80. So I feel a part of the family we call /stopdrinking. The least I can do is tell a small part of my story. And just to say thank you, all of you guys. 
Dont say no to help. And while in the grips of addiction it can feel impossible to get out. Trust me it isn't.

Honestly while being there I felt so hopeful as I embarked on my path towards recovery but now that I am out on my own I am feeling so overwhelmed. Today is my 6th day of sobriety, the longest I have gone in as long as I can remember. I know this will get easier, but right now this feels like the hardest experience of my life. Weirdly enough, I don’t feel the urge to drink as much as I am feeling an overwhelming sense of shame, anxiety, and outright depression. Is this a normal side effect after doing a clinical detox? 

Any words of encouragement or advice to ease my anxiety ridden mind are welcome.",12,0

Today is officially Day 7!

I have a craving on Friday just because Friday used to mean I could drink with my husband. Instead, I picked up a new graphics card and head set and spent the weekend playing video games with my husband and our mutual friend (7 Days to Die is a much better game when the screen doesn't freeze every time I move). I was scared about the weekend because it was such a scheduled thing- chores and housework during the day, drinking until belligerent after 8. But we didn't! And I went to bed when I was actually tired, and woke up without a hangover and so much less anxiety. 

And as for today?

I'm putting it here, because I thought it may help someone else today. Warning...it's gon be long!

1. Alcohol is going to be all around you all the time, along with lots of people who can enjoy this thing that you once enjoyed so very much, without enduring the same consequences as you. That is not fair. But there is no way that you can change that. You have tried, and failed, countless times and you need to accept that alcohol has no place in your life. NONE. It might help you to focus on every other aspect of your life that has been so blessed, and all the gifts YOU have that others might not (however, these gifts do not mean you can hack this drinking thing...sorry). And while others may drink without as harsh of consequences, everyone gets hungover when they drink too much. So enjoy never dealing with that bullshit ever again.
2. You're not just doing this for you. While your big motivator for quitting has always been to minimize your own suffering and conflict in this life, your son is growing up. It won't be long until he begins to experience negative effects as a result of your drinking, if you choose to let alcohol back into your life. You've always known how to quit when you're ahead. You cannot undue the past mistakes you've made, the moments lost and forgotten, the days you've spent hungover, but you CAN stop before this hurts your son. He can grow up free of the consequences of your drinking. You have SO MUCH to lose. You are going to hurt him despite your best efforts because you are not perfect as a parent. Don't add unnecessary pain to his childhood, or make his life any harder or more complicated, in the name of alcohol. It is not worth it.  
3. Life is always better on this side of the bottle... ALWAYS. But sometimes it will only be very slightly better. You are going to feel that you're missing out at times because of all the fond memories you've had while using alcohol, paired with the fact that others will be having pleasurable experiences with alcohol around you. YOU ARE NOT MISSING ANYTHING YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY DONE COUNTLESS TIMES! You have BTDT (been there, drank that!). You will never wake up saying ""man, I really wish I had drank myself stupid last night.""
4. No one cares that you're not drinking. During your sober times, you've obsessed prior to events where you know others will be drinking about what excuse to come up with... wondering how it will make them feel, and if it will be awkward. And when the time came, no one gave a shit. You're a 30-something mom. There have only been a couple of times where someone said ""oh you're not drinking? Like at ALL?"" and in those cases, they've went on to explain how much they are drinking and why (proving that your not drinking made them question their own drinking). Besides, you don't have to answer to anyone except yourself and your family. What your son, yourself and your husband think of you, is all that matters at the end of the day.",18,0

I won’t be enabled by others when they may not know how to effectively support me through my addiction. 

So, it seems I may have went about my sobriety the wrong way, or at least partially wrong. The last time I seriously quit drinking was after some pretty bad nights of being an angry, judgmental, and overall ass to my wife. I spent the next several days, and the next 6 months, trying to repair some of the damage. She told me it was the last time I would act that way, or she will leave. I told myself then I would stop drinking in order to improve our relationship. 

Fast forward to my latest relapse. I was sober for about 6 months. It’s hard to explain without sounding like I’m not taking full responsibility. I am. I’m the one who decided to drink again. No one forced me. I’m pretty good at refraining from taking that first drink. I’ve went years without a drink. In the past couple of years, I’ve went months without. Trying to drink in moderation is my problem. There is no moderation, it ends in nightly binges, blackouts, and shameful memories. 

Looking back at all those times when I decided to try again, I didn’t consider the late nights, crappy morning, and the “Mr. Hyde” in me. And this time around, Mr. Hyde didn’t show up.

Here’s where it may sound like I’m not taking responsibility. It’s not. I think it actually illustrates that I wanted sobriety for the wrong reasons, and I was relying on someone else for support more than I should’ve. 

Each time I started up again, I felt like I had a green light. If it was really as bad as it was, why would my wife asked if we wanted to grab a drink after work? Or bring a surprise 6-pack home for me in the middle of a stretch of sobriety? Or not say anything, when, “Hey, do you really think that’s a good idea after the last time?” when I say I’m thinking of grabbing something on the way home.

What confused me is my wife is a therapist. She’s worked in CD treatment places along with mental health treatment. So she must know how this all works, right?

We talked the other night. She said she doesn’t know how to support me. Which got me thinking, I can’t rely on cues from my wife. I  realized I need to be vigilant with my sobriety.

I love my wife and we’re getting into marriage therapy to improve our relationship. But I need to maintain my sobriety for myself. The other improvements will benefit from me taking care of myself.",9,0

I am fully aware conceptually that attempting to moderate is like thinking you can go to the casino and win. Like sure, you _can_, but the odds are very much against you.

Yet I keep thinking I'm smarter than the casino, or that I'm special or something and these rules don't apply to me. Over. and over.

This is all fascinating to me because I'm actually trying to live an examined life. I meditate, I journal, I try to find out where I'm screwing up and can be better. And yet this is perpetually a massive blind spot.

I won't stop trying to play this losing game because I'm afraid to put myself out there in front of my friends and potentially fail yet again. _I_ even roll my eyes at the prospect of me quitting at this point. And I'm afraid I'll miss opportunities,

And the thing is, I _will_ miss opportunities. That's what I didn't realize about this before - it takes actual sacrifice. Not just sacrificing getting drunk, it'll take more than that. I used to think that things should just be 100% better for having quit, and when they weren't, I would just give up and go back.

No, it turns out that living your true values requires some actual sacrifice. By definition, such a big lifestyle change will cause massive rearrangement in one's life, and will inevitably cause pain. And that's not all bad - some of that stuff, you _want_ to have missed out on.

As a thought experiment: if I stumbled in to a friend group that completely didn't drink, and for whom it would be weird if I even did drink around them, I wouldn't think twice about quitting. In fact I kind of fantasize about this happening. That's a huge flashing sign that I'm living other people's values, and not my own.

I hope that he can forgive me, but either way I have to learn and grow and hold myself accountable for what I have done. Stopping drinking is what I need to do. Sober me never would have dreamed of doing this.

1096,2020-07-20 09:33:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hulb89/one_year_of_no_alcohol/,One Year of No Alcohol,"One Year Sober  I have officially not had any alcohol for one year as of today. I have posted a few times this year with some milestones and challenges. Even when not posting I still check out this sub every day for inspiration and to see how people are doing.  A lot happened this year. I have remained in the same house with my wife of nearly 23 years, though we have been effectively separated for the past three years. It is very difficult and the toxicity of our relationship does not make staying sober any easier. We don't communicate much. When we do it usually turns into a disagreement and she tends to throw my past drinking in my face. I can take these jabs with a clear conscience, though, because I know I have maintained my sobriety and there is nothing I can do to go back to the past to make myself quit drinking any sooner than I did.  

I had to say goodbye to my 16 year old dog, Zoey, back in January. That was difficult and the experience really tested the limits of how much I wanted to stay sober. I posted to this sub, got some support and managed to say sober despite grieving horribly for her. The ensuing loneliness of not having her around, especially once the Covid lockdown started, really pushed me to the limit. Still, though, I did not drink on any of the past 365 days.  

There were many times that I came close to cracking and just getting hammered. One night a little more than 2 months ago, the wife announced that she would be taking my two youngest kids (12 and 15) to stay the night at her mom's house. She sprang this on me with no warning, and was gone for the night. My oldest son (18) was out with friends and I knew that he wouldn't be home until late at night. This left me feeling incredibly alone, upset and very close to just giving in and getting drunk. I got so far as to get into my car with the intention of driving down to the local store and getting a few beers and a bottle of vodka. I drove towards the store, but kept taking detours down neighborhood streets. I reminded myself of how bad hangovers feel and how much I didn't want to have one. I also reminded myself that if I did it that day I would probably cave in and do it the next day. And so on.

I turned the car around, went home and went to bed sober.

About 2 months ago we adopted a dog from a local rescue organization. She is super affectionate and quickly became my best friend. She helps me to fight off the loneliness and staying sober is a little easier when I feel less alone and isolated.   

I also took up mindfulness meditation over the past year, but only really started getting serious about it back in May. It has helped me a lot. More than anything, mindfulness practice has showed me that everything - thoughts, emotions, cravings - are all temporary, no matter how intense they might be when they first make an appearance. Through regular practice I have learned a lot about myself and have a very powerful tool to help me to stay sober. I know that I can observe the desires to get drunk without latching onto them. Given time those desires will fade and eventually go away completely. Even if I have to repeat this process of observation over and over, I know that the desire to drink will always just dissolve, like every other thought that I've had in my life.  

That's all for my one year check in. There have been great moments, and I definitely feel a lot better than I did when drinking and wrapped up in constant anxiety/depression. I exercise regularly and have managed to lose over 40 pounds, and have kept it off. Life hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows, but it isn't supposed to be. I know that even though I have made it this far that the desire to drink will rear its head again (and again, and again) in the future. All I know is I made it to where I am now. I'll deal with the temptations to drink when they come. And I hope to maintain being sober for the rest of my life.  

Like I tell people who seem surprised to learn that I stopped drinking - ""I have already drank enough for probably 5 normal lifetimes over the years, so I am okay with not drinking any more."" People who know me well enough know this to be true, and they usually just agree with me and that's that.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

This week's AoK happened in Santa Ana CA. [Kenia Barragan stopped to talk to a 94 year old street vendor, Jose Villa Ochoa, who goes by the nickname, ""Don Joel""](https://www.chron.com/life/article/94-year-old-street-vendor-brought-to-tears-after-15416280.php), who was out selling tamales. Kenia learned that Don Joel was selling tamales because he could not find other work at his age, and that he was unable to earn enough money to pay for basic needs like food, medicine, or a phone.

At first, she gave him a torta and a few dollars.
But Kenia went on to use social media to raise money for him, getting $84,000 in donations in one weekend. She also bought him a new wheelchair and a new pair of shoes. ""Don Joel said he cried because he felt truly appreciated.""

What I love about this AoK is the amount of consideration for another person's needs. Kenia took the time to talk to him and listen to him, and then took action to help someone else meet their basic needs. I know that I can't fix anyone else's life for them, but I can take time to stop and talk to people and hear about where they're at, rather than make assumptions.

My AoK this week was a lot smaller, but it was also about stopping to listen to someone else. I met a woman in an AA meeting who talked about struggling with loneliness. I've struggled with loneliness at many points in my life, starting well before I started drinking, but it got much worse as my drinking progressed, so I have a lot of empathy for how painful it is. Connection is a need, not a luxury.

After the meeting she asked if anyone was interested in getting some coffee. I've got a lot on my plate at the moment, but I also know that I still waste plenty of time throughout my day, so I decided I could spend an hour hanging out with her. We talked about all sorts of things. It did me good to get some socializing in, and it also did me good to get out of my own head and prioritize someone else for a bit. It felt good to spend an hour not thinking about myself, and it also felt good to know that I was offering the type of support that someone else needed. I wasn't giving her what I wanted to give her, I was giving what she asked for.

That's me for this week. How's everyone else doing, any AoK that you'd like to share?",13,0

A couple weeks ago, a relationship I was end cane to an end. In the spirit of AA, I was trying to be better at identifying resentments and addressing them when possible. Partner and I were getting into a habit of expressing resentments in regards to our expectations towards each other and the actions/in-actions each of us would do. 

After some time, our relationship began to fizzle out and when had “the talk” to finally end things, the main resentment my partner had towards me was that I had changed since getting sober and I wasn’t the same person anymore. It didn’t really hurt at the time. At the end of the day, myself and my sobriety come first. 

Went to a meeting a couple days ago with the break up still heavy on my mind. The topic was “Shame” and how we would feel shame about ourselves during our drinking. It had me thinking about how sometimes there is a shame that comes with telling people we’re sober because in order to come forth with our sobriety, we had to admit our alcoholism. 

While it wasn’t the best situation and has had emotional ripples, I am thankful I had not touched a drop throughout all this. By the grace of God, my program, and my sponsor I’ve been able to make it through this time.",40,0

One bad binge night recently had me suffering pretty badly the next morning. I don’t remember much since this happened while I was half asleep early in the AM. I remember feeling hot, sweating, my face feeling funny and slightly numb, being lightheaded, and at least for a few minutes, writhing in intense pain and moaning, possibly twitching (?) or at least tossing and turning in bed a lot. It kind of felt like those sleep paralysis dreams where you’re screaming and trying to move but can’t move much, although I think I did move some. Maybe I was sleeping and actually dreaming for part of it? Not sure. Then I tried to get up before losing consciousness. Don’t know how long I was out but I did fall, and it wouldn’t be the first time I fell *after* a night of drinking. The fall resulted in some bruising and possibly a mild concussion.

Again since I lost consciousness I don’t remember much, but this is really unusual hangover stuff. Usually I am nauseous, have a headache, and diarrhea, but this felt more episodic and intense in nature. I wish I could remember more but I suspect this was an alcohol-related seizure. The more I research about rum fits, the more it makes sense. I hope I’m wrong. I’m scared and worried but don’t have any neurological symptoms at the moment so that might suggest I don’t have severe withdrawal symptoms, probably because I wasn’t a daily drinker. Maybe it was just an acute episode. In any case I think it’s about time I go clean for a while, not using “it’s okay to binge once in a while” as an excuse anymore.

Edit: for some more info I actually only had about half of what it usually takes to black out, and didn’t vomit or have a bad hangover after I came to, but I guess a lot depends on your bodily status day to day.",3,0

I am aware that I have turned to another vice, food, to dull the feelings that push me towards alcohol. However I am choosing the least bad of two options for today with the hope that my options get less poor over time.

Something that has occurred to me is I have no natural patience anymore. My patience came from the release of booze, or, being overly nice knowing that my reward would be booze in xx number of hours.

So, now knowing that there is no “reward” in sight I snap near instantly.

I went to visit him and he'd clearly been at it for a while, and as I crunched on skittles our conversation meandered at his whim as he continued swigging vodka. I cracked at one point and took a couple sips off his drink and put it right back down as it tasted like hangovers and sadness, but he kept at it and gradually a disagreement about music turned into a disagreement about everything. As I questioned why he was unhappy and tried to reason with him he dug his heels in deeper and accused me of attacking him until in a huff at 5am he went to bed and I silently screamed in the bathroom. This morning I tried to get him to talk about it but honestly I think he was still drunk and he brushed me off. I was miserable today and mostly stayed in bed, feeling depressed, sleep deprived, and beating myself up for my mistakes when after a lot of contemplation I think the only mistake I made was trying to reason with a belligerent drunk person.

Yep, therapy would be nice but we're both marginally employed in the pandemic and access in the USA is a bish.

There seems to be a certain stigma that comes with being a non-drinker. When I say ""I don't drink"", it's like *oh, you're one of those people.* 

Saying ""I'm not much of a drinker these days"" gets the message across without the possibility of triggering that awkwardness.

About 3 years ago my wife and I left our hometown to move to another city for work. Our quality of life quickly deteriorated as work took over; my drinking became habitually excessive. 

I have always had a tendency to overindulge, but I had offset it with a decent diet, alcohol-free days and a good measure of exercise.  

As work stress increased, the space created by the friends, routine and good habits that we left behind, was filled with wine and indulgent food.  My mental health declined, my weight ballooned and good habits fell away. I could feel it happening, and I tried to resists, but after a year or so I kind of just settled into it. 

The news that my wife was pregnant (unplanned) prompted me to make a change. The volume of my drinking decreased but the frequency persisted. I started using [Less](https://lessdrinks.com/) to track my drinking. My goal was to change my mindset from counting the number of alcohol-free days in a month to the number of days that I had drunk in a month; to swap the red and green dots.  12 months later I had some better balance. I'd had some longer streaks of a week, two weeks, two and a half weeks.  But the number of alcohol-free days were still fewer than 'within limit' or over-limit days. 

April 19th 2020 was the last day I worked. I lost my job due to COVID-19 and my wife, who was on maternity leave and informed that she could not return to work as planned.  We hastily packed up our rental apartment, 10-month old daughter, and the dog escaped to the country to minimise our expenses and wait out the crisis. Once resettled there was a week or so of excessive drinking to unpack what had happened and fret about the future. The Easter long weekend we feasted and drank fancy wine and beer and forgot our troubles.

After  Easter, I decided that I was faced with a choice. I could let the pandemic become an excuse to use alcohol to manage my stress again or I could use the break from work finally end my drinking habit and regain my health. 

Since then I've drunk on **only two days,** one day I had two glasses of wine with dinner the other was a 'session' with friends who we hadn't seen during the lockdown. 

That's **85 out of 87 drink free-days** and my **current streak is 65 days!** 

I don't think I've been alcohol-free for that many consecutive days since I was 17 (20 years). I have no plan to start drinking again and I don't really miss it. 

**Non-drinking related achievements since losing my job include**

1. Lost more than 19kg (42lb) (all body fat)
2. Quit processed food, take-away food and binge-eating
3. Lowered my resting heart rate by 10 beats per minute
4. Ran a half marathon in May, June and July ( I hadn't run this far in about 3 years)
5. Ran my fastest ever 5km, 10km, 15km and half marathon
6. Ran 200km, Walked 200km and Rode 100km all in the month of May
7. Trained to do 50 pushups
8. Improved my mood and sleep
9. Was more present for my wife and daughter

All of those things were made possible by removing alcohol from my life. It took me nearly two years to get it under control (from when I found out we were pregnant until now) and I started and failed and started again dozens of times.

If two years ago, I believed/understood that I could transform myself so dramatically in 90 days by quitting alcohol it would have been all the motivation that I needed to commit.

Sunday morning grocery shops are a routine for me and in previous times it would have been a hazy hungover affair (but never hungover enough to grab a few high abv craft beers for the afternoon). The other shameful thing I'd do is get some cash out while paying, so I could by beers later in the week without it showing on the joint bank account.

The time of my shopping hasn't changed but I am finding it an interesting experience while I'm sober. A few observations:

* The whole experience is waaaaaay less stressful and I didn't even realize I was stressed by it before. I'm feeling less rushed and more interested in looking at the foods/items

* Supermarkets devote a shocking amount of space to booze. I appreciate that booze generates a massive amount of income for them, so it ""earns"" that floor realestate, but god damn. The footprint of the booze section would be the size of most apartments/town houses

* You start observing others who are possibly struggling with alcohol. Often their carts have a few basic foods and a lot of drinks. This Sunday I saw a woman who just looked so sad. Her eyes were dead looking and her face was puffy and her cart had 3 or 4 boxes of cask wine. Those drinks looked like they weren't going to bring her any joy whatsoever. I actually just wanted to give her a hug and tell her it was OK

Not sure what the point of this post is, just some general observations about the differences sobriety has on a completely mundane task.

I hope you are enjoying a happy Sunday/Monday morning. If you are lurking here and think about making some changes, you are in the right place. Stay and read some posts and reach out if you feel you can.",34,0

I ABSOLUTELY have a drinking problem right now. But I've also struggled with the thought that I'm not even sure if it's a problem with drinking or a problem with the circumstances in my life. Think it's a bit of both.
I'm in therapy. I've talked about it. I use drinking as a coping mechanism for the constant chaos I've experienced my entire life.
Unfortunately that chaos has only ramped up lately, so with it, so has my drinking. I'm to the point of just maintenance drinking now, I don't even do it for fun. Just to keep the emotions and shakes away. I have never done anything abusive or destructive (except to myself by poisoning myself constsntly), and if anything, I can get crazy drunk and just offer to play video games with people because they could actually beat me in that state.
But I know about the disease. I haven't yet experienced consequences, but I have enough foresight to look down the road and realize they aren't far away. I'm just hoping I'm smart enough to change lanes before that happens.
I've spent the last 72 hours trying to furiously deal with the problems that I have in my life. Personal, professional, emotional, etc. Reaching out to old friends, reaching out here, So I really am trying on that front.
What terrifies me the most is that I am just making excuses for the disease. And that when I fix personal problems, I'll reward myself with a drink, or still think that ""See, I'm okay! Its not a problem!"" And then the disease will just become silent, and the consequences will eventually surface, as we all know they will.
No idea if this is where I should even be. But I have plenty of an idea that the fact I can hardly go 4 hours without a drink isn't okay. And I know how supportive everyone here is, and I've decided to finally reach out. Just too damn tired these days to have anxiety anymore, and trying my damndest to be vulnerable and emotional finally.

And then I take a sip of alcohol. And I become a different person when I drink. I’m loud, obnoxious, aggressive. I’m destructive. I say awful, terrible things to people I love. I break shit. I hurt myself. I smoke, I eat like shit, I try to fight people. I put myself in dangerous situations. I get suicidal. And I keep drinking, because the idea of facing the shit that I did that day is too much. So you keep going. And it eventually catches up. I stop, I clean myself up, clean up my home, erase all traces of it, get back to feeling successful.  I did it, I beat it. I’ll celebrate with a drink. 

And then it’s the same shit over and over. I’ve woken up in the hospital, I’ve been hospitalized due to injuries from being blackout drunk multiple times. I’ve been to counseling.

Normally by 3pm when he shows I’m already a pint of whiskey in and cracking 1 of 4 tall cans to tide me over till when he leaves and I have my goodnight pint. 
Instead today I woke up, went and got my wife some donuts, did some shopping, played a little last of us 2 while snacking on veg until he showed up. Also took the time to vacuum and clean the man cave and light some scented candles. 
For the past 2 hours we have been having great conversation, geeking out on wrestling, I helped him with some leg pain he’s been having (I’m a therapist), and we’re grubbin on some Indian food.

My family has been ignoring me since beginning my sober journey (despite claiming they kept their distance before *because* of my drinking). They only come around when my sister needs a sitter, and are super inconsiderate about my meetings schedule, causing me to miss one last week. 

Well today, it hit the fan. My mom got pissed because I didn’t want to run around in a face mask in 105* heat index at an outdoor flea market because she and my sister have a new flea market show on hgtv or some bullshit so it’s their new thing. I also said I didn’t have money to spend right now (with drinking game frivolous spending so I’ve got a lot of stupid tax to pay). She was petty enough to go on and on over text despite me saying if she didn’t give me time to process my feelings I was going to say something I may regret later. I finally picked up the phone and called, saying that doing this over text was childish. I pointed out that despite the points I made about feeling ignored and alone in my sobriety as well as a lack of respect and consideration for only being contacted when they needed something and disregarded my schedule and meetings wasn’t healthy for me. She turned it right back around trying to make herself the victim, “well I’ve had a shitty year too!” I was like “mom, look at 2020, who HASNT it been shitty for? Try dealing with that and getting sober ON TOP OF THAT!” Then she kept alluding to having an addiction of her own but was a big baby and wouldn’t say what it supposedly was. I told her to stop bullshitting because I know she doesn’t drink and has had the same bottle of Xanax hidden in the cupboard for ten years. So then she blurts our “I LIKE TO OVEREAT AND I THINK ABOUT LOTTERY SCRATCHERS A LOT SO JUST BECAUSE IM NOT IN AN ACTIVE ADDICTION DOESNT MEAN IM NOT A GAMBLING ADDICT!” 

So she compared her maybe once a month scratch off ticket to her daughter’s hospital detox and intensive outpatient therapy. What in the actual fuck? She’s also in denial about things and likes to act like if she can’t remember, it must not have happened. That came up when I told her I was finally putting myself first for once, despite her always putting me On the back burner in favor of my sister and her kids. I reminded her of 4 years ago how she had asked me to postpone a very important surgery for a month so she could take my nephew to vacation bible school. This was despite knowing about the surgery almost 8 months in advance, it wasn’t a surprise. I had to tell her I would board my dogs and Uber to and from the hospital before I moved the date for her to finally agree to drive me. But that just couldn’t have happened since she didn’t possibly remember (much like how she insists she co-signed my mortgage, even after being shown the paperwork repeatedly). She claims that she can’t take me seriously when I say I don’t have spending money because I “buy whatever I want.” I told her my finances were none of her business and that part of getting sober was cleaning up my financial mess. I told her that her codependency and this entire family dynamic was toxic and I feel like she almost doesn’t want me to succeed in sobriety. Then she told me that she’s done with me and hung up on me.

I honestly still can’t believe that call happened, it’s one of those things that you just shake your head and wonder, is this real life? I know I have to stand my ground though, setting boundaries isn’t easy but part of it is not backing down and teaching people how you expect to be treated. I just really needed to vent, and seeing as I’ve lost most of my friends by entering treatment, this was about the only place I’ve got.",5,1

Will I lose all my friends?  Will I be able to be talkative and outgoing at networking or business functions?

If you follow Stoic philosophy, you may be familiar with the writer Epictetus.  In his ""Discourses"", he has an interesting commentary on the dichotomy between the social drunkard and the dull teetotaller.  Bear in mind this was written about two thousand years ago.  


>Formerly, when you were devoted to worthless pursuits, your friends found you congenial company.  But you can't be a hit in both roles.  To the extent you cultivate one you will fall short in the other.  You can't seem as affable to your old cronies if you don't go out drinking with them as of old.  So choose whether you want to be a charming drunk in their company, or dull and sober on your own.  You can't expect the same reception from the group you used to associate with if you don't go carousing with them regularly anymore.    
  
>  
>So again you have a choice: if you value dignity and restraint over being called a 'sport' by your old mates, then forget other considerations, renounce them, walk away and having nothing more to do with that crowd.  If you don't like that, then commit to the opposite course with all your heart.  Join the louche set, become one of the degenerates - do as they do and indulge your every impulse and desire.  Jump around and yell at a musical performance, what's to stop you now?  
  
>  
>Epictetus*, Discourses and Selected Writings*, Book IV, Chapter 2, Verses 6 - 9

Epictetus is explaining that you can't be a sober-minded individual who practices dignity and restraint while still being loved by the ""louche set"".  Choose between them, but make your choice wholeheartedly.  This resonated for me as my social relationships are now completely different after two years of sobriety.",27,0

It was nice outside and I had just gotten back from my daughters pool party.  On the way home I was thinking “you know, you’ve been good lately, just stop and get a 6 pack”.  I passed the store but didn’t stop to get beer.  I just went home disappointed that I couldn’t just enjoy a 6 pack anymore.  

When I got home I was still feeling the itch and was sitting on my back porch and almost said screw it, I’m going to get beer.  I just thought of all the times I’ve been down this road.  At the time it was difficult to play the tape through because I was feeling good.  But I really concentrated and was able to think about the 2 days in bed and crippling depression and loathing.  

So instead I went and made a cup of coffee at 5 PM.  I didn’t care what time it was.  It scratched the itch and the urge passed just like a wave hitting the shore.  I then turned in for an early bed time and read my book.  Slept really good and woke up with a smile.

The exeriment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 

Today's reading had two topics. The day 12 reading was about our bodies and how we treat them. The big idea I took away from this chapter was on how effective the plasibo effect really is. If we believe for instance that giving up drinking will be hard, then our brains will believe that. If we think positively about abstaining from alcohol it will be much easier. That's exactly how it's been for me. I'm on vacation, and I've been a doing completely fine. 


The other topic was alcohol and happiness. I was one to think that alcohol made me happy. However, it's so closely tied to many occassions: weddings, birthdays, promotions etc. Annie made the comment if drinking made you happy you could drink and drink and keep feeling more and more elated. However, most the time the opposite is true. It made me pause and reconfirm that I do not need alcohol to be happy.

I've needed to do this for the longest time. Today is the day.

This all started out fun with friends, drinking every weekend. Took a turn around 5 years ago at Christmas when we got burgled. Never felt safe in my own home, couldn't sleep. The drink helped.

Since then it's a bottle of wine a night. Alcohol has never brought any good into my life, a lot of bad, including an incident in which I let a girl kiss me in a bar despite having a girlfriend (now wife) and a few months ago my lowest point of having too many gins on a Saturday while my wife was at work and blacking out for 30mins while watching my kid.

Being a good Dad is the only thing I'm really sure about in life and that was my lowest low. Of course I made excuses for why it was a one off etc and while nothing like that has ever happened since, I have decided now is the time I need to free myself from this.

I would really appreciate all your support and help on this journey! Thank you.",8,0

I’ve lost many things because of my rampant alcoholism including jobs and relationships over the last decade. The last two years especially bad. I can drink bottle upon bottle of anything with alcohol in it, often for weeks at a time, at any point in the day. As of July 1st of this year, I was 120 some odd days sober- definitely something I’ve never done before. I turned into this sharp, intelligent, and kind people-person that started to develop again. 

I went to visit a friend and thought I could handle a drink or two- nope. About three weeks later I wake up in my bed unable to move, in unbearable pain, sweating, freezing cold, nightmares, legitimately thought I was going to die. I hadn’t eaten anything for about 4 days prior, I had realized. I just laid in bed and drank. I had been a toxic fucking asshole to all my friends and family, a complete 180 from the progress I had made. 

Today I woke up, pounded water, forced myself on a run and realized something huge. As cheesy as it sounds, it’s about getting the FUCK BACK UP. As alcoholics we can do so well then get caught in a loop and get triggered and fall so far. We often have a blessing and a curse with the disease and life is HARD- it is no joke especially right now. I’m just saying if you’re here with me now- YOU ARE TOUGH AS NAILS AND I LOVE YOU.

Sometimes I would get really bored on a Wednesday or Thursday and would polish off a few beers or a half bottle. 

I was recently diagnosed with a bladder condition, and had surgery last Monday to fix it. My doctor said 48 hours after the surgery I could drink alcohol again, but I want to get better as soon as possible so I decided to cut out alcohol for one month to give myself the best chance to heal. I haven’t had alcohol for 2 weeks already. Alcohol didn’t cause my illness. I’m not overweight, and have no other medical issues. 

This was the first weekend in my country where 3 households can meet up indoors due to COVID, so my friends and I booked a cottage in the middle of the countryside for a get together. We are usually quite big drinkers, and it was going to be a big one since this is the first time we all got together since March. 

I got some fizzy fruit juice, fake rum and ginger beer for the weekend. My friends made me feel included in the drinking games, I had a good time, and I didn’t get FOMO except from when I bailed at 3 in the morning when everyone else was steaming. It felt great to wake up fresh, and I was glad not to have the hangover all my friends had. I used to get really bad hangovers that would last at least the full day afterwards that ruined my weekend.

With my recent diagnosis, I’m really evaluating my health priorities and wondering if I should keep this up? It’s also good for my mental health to have my full weekend back, as well as not worry about what my stupid drunken self done the night before.

I need a win today, so here goes!

Things I have survived sober so far:

- A general election in my country
- A heartbreak
- My first Halloween, Christmas, New year's, and birthday without alcohol in about 9 years
- Going to bars as a sober person in their mid 20's (turns out that was only a big deal to me)
- An actual global pandemic (didn't see that one coming, hey?)
- Being literally 'locked down' in a house FULL of booze
- Telling my best friend about my alcoholism (who was very supportive, I'm very grateful)
- An intervention (not my own, but still very stressful)

It did take a while to see results. It was not easy. I am still not 'out' to many people I care about for fear that I'll relapse and let them down, but every day I live sober and accepting that I'm not a person who can have 'just one' really has led me closer to the person I want to be. I think with far more clarity and make better decisions for myself. I see a future, finally.

If you are just starting out, I wish the same joy for you. Making the change was the hardest, but best thing I've ever done, and I couldn't have done it without the solidarity of this sub.

Naturally, I went on a bender and being in quarantine the bender didn’t stop. Drinking was my new “job”. Then the weather was beautiful and we were BBQ’ing all the time. What better time to drink. 
    Eventually come the end of April I was very sick and couldn’t function. Checked myself into the hospital for a medical detox. Left there feeling  amazing except for the constant anxiety/ agitation I had. That I just couldn’t shake. It wasn’t mental anxiety so much as physical. And I don’t mean DT’s I mean like my body was just amped up and couldn’t settle. I was sober and generally feeling well but could get nothing accomplished. Despite that, I made it almost 45 days without touching a drop. Two and half weeks ago we made the decision to put one of our elderly dogs down. That combined with this non stop agitation was my trigger. I went to the liquor store “ for just one”. We all know how that went.

The world tells you a lot about alcohol, but much like a social media influencer, it only shows it’s fun side.

It doesn’t tell you that alcohol ruins more lives than all other drugs combined. Yet, not only is it encouraged, but it is glorified. It doesn’t tell you that your close friends and family will not understand how you can not drink, and even some will actively try and get you to “just have one.”

If you give up that beer with the boys (or girls) you will sleep better, you will train harder, you will retain more information, and your body will thank you. 

Sure it feels like it sucks at first, but you will NEVER wake up and regret not drinking. However, I’m sure most of us can agree we have regretted drinking countless mornings.

It could be a job loss that has us down or something else that makes feeling great about our lives challenging. But most things are temporary - we’ll eventually get a job and it will be a better job than our last one. Or we’ll move on a from a relationship and the next one will be even better than the last one. 

For me to feel really positive about myself, I’d say the single most important thing in stopping drinking was finding something to do with myself that would have a positive impact. I needed something to focus my time and create a challenge for myself. For me it was getting back in shape with running, cycling, and a bit of lifting. Stopping drinking wasn’t enough. I had to go another step.  I’ve now lost 20 lbs and have put on good toned muscle. With the exercise I now really do feel like my teens - happy, in shape, trying to be my best.  If I didn’t add the renewed focus on exercise, I wouldn’t feel nearly as good. The life challenges as mentioned above would bring me down. 

So my recommendation to anyone is to find a hobby or rekindle an old passion and get it going consistently. If you don’t exercise,  make a plan to walk 30 mins a day and work your way up from there. The physical motion helps my mind and gets my brain off the drink. I rarely think about booze and don’t have as many triggers now due to wanting to remain in top shape and planning my next day’s exercise and feeling good for it. Alcohol is poison in my body and I can’t have that if I’m going to get a good run in.

First, I hope that this is allowed, but i have never actually been an alcoholic, i have just had a major alcohol abuse. To tell the story from my mid-teens to my early twenties i would get blackout drunk weekly, and be very intoxicated every weekend. That let into a snowball effect, you see, i am not the nice guy when i get that drunk. So in order to cope with the mistakes i would look forward to the next weekend, where i could get so drunk that i for a minute could, frankly, relax and ""disappear"". This abuse, was accompanied with heavy psycholocial issues that has been following me ever since. I am not depressed, but suffer from anxiety and some PTSD-like bodily reactions when the past creeps into my mind. At that time, i didnt have an identity, one one-hand i was a empatic kind and understanding person on the other hand, i was the out of control drunk, and in at that time, i would not know which of the ones were truly me.

But, i can happily say, that i have not had a single drop of alcohol in a month and havent had a blackout for over a year. And i can promise you, that i will never welcome any kind of alcohol in my blood. I have a wonderful life and i have something that i hadnt had in almost my entire life, an identity - i finally know, who i was of my two personalities.

The best thing about quitting is that i now know who i am, i no longer question my own moral values. But frankly, it is also the hardest part. I keep repeating stupid arguments and decisions from my alcohol abuse in my mind and i have a hard time knowing if there is somebody that can help. When i was a 18 year old guy desperate to get some help, a doctor told me that i could not get it, since i wasn't an alcoholic and i could just ""make and excuse to not to out and stop drinking"".

Do anyone in this community know, if there is any helpful sources for people who have not overcomed  alcoholism (praise you) but rather, have overcome alcohol abuse?",7,0

No big deal, right? Well this time I was sweating for a totally different reason and it felt like such an accomplishment.

 Less than a year ago, I would have been walking in to grab a box of wine and a few tall cans for the day, or to continue from the night before. It actually motivated me to run even harder and give myself some much needed self-love for getting to where I am in this journey. At age 37 I had been hospitalized 3 times for pancreatitis and then diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Since then, I have lost 30lbs and managed to get my blood sugar under control with mostly diet and exercise.

It's the most difficult thing I've ever done, but putting in the hard work pays off. Take it one day at a time and focus on the bigger picture. You can do it too!

I get it and don't yell at me when I say what I'm here to bitch about.  I just need to gripe to someone and get it off my chest.

There's this one person.  She's been on since my Day 1 (granted, not a long time in the big picture of life and recovery).  She posts probably 4 or 5 times a week about how she's drinking again.  Posts WHILE drinking--posts that she wants to quit drinking, but darn it, she's drinking again.  What it's turned into is basically a drinking diary.  Here I am drinking again.  Yep, it's day 3 and I'm drinking.  Went over to the in-laws and they stressed me out so I'm drinking.  I'm at work so not drinking but the call to drink when I get home is so strong.  Came home and drank.  Drinkety drink drink.  Still drinking.

Asked for book suggestions a few weeks ago, and replied to almost every person, ""Yep, read it!""  ""Read that one too haha.""  ""Read it, didn't really like it.""  Etc. etc. etc.

People keep responding ""You can do it!""  ""You've got this!"" and so on, but to me, I really want to say something very tough-love-ish to her (or maybe just tough because I'm not feeling the love presently) because it just seems silly to me to keep cheering and cheerleading when all that's different between her and regular old drinkers is she's found a place to come and talk about it.  I guess the fact she talks about it means she is concerned, but it's tedious, it can't help but be triggering to some, and it's useless as hell.  It's like telling your kid to clean up her room, having her NOT clean up her room but complain about her messy room.  Daily.  Yep, room's still not clean.  I hate living in a messy room.

My city has been in different levels of lockdown for months, now at the most severe. I can’t visit my family or my friends as it would breach travel restrictions and I can only leave the house to get food and exercise, as long as it’s not too far away, or risk being fined. 

I completed a postgrad that I now can’t get a job with because the job market is awful. I haven’t been on a single date all year, don’t have any flirtation in my life and currently don’t feel like a sexual entity at all. 

I had to cut off a long time friendship because it became too one sided and toxic and I now spend 95% of my time alone in my room studying, looking for jobs or working on my hobbies and 5% of my time exercising by myself. 

Yet my mental health is somehow better than it ever was when I was drinking. Life could be better and I know it eventually will be, but at least for now I don’t have to deal with hungover anxiety, violent mood swings, wasted days doing absolutely nothing and random sadness that I have no control over. 

None of these external problems that we face can even remotely be solved with drinking. Stay focused on your path to self-improvement, especially on the tough days, that’s when it really counts!

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago I had started to grow really tired of sobriety. It had started to feel like enough was enough, and that I didn't want to let the whole summer go by without ever having a beer while grilling, or on a bar patio somewhere.

&#x200B;

Then last night I started really thinking again about the way things were. I started thinking about how one night, just a few weeks before I went AF, I got off of my double shift at the restaurant and started drinking as soon as I got home. I kept going until I ran out of beer around 4:45 a.m. or so, and then waited up for the gas station down the street to start selling again and got more. I continued until around 7:30 a.m. or so when I finally passed out on the couch.

&#x200B;

I had to wake up just a couple hours later and go to work at 11:00 am that morning. Even if this were an isolated incident it would have been bad enough, but it wasn't. I did something similar I'd say on average at least once every 10 days or so.

I'm traveling (fortunately for work, but that never stopped me before) to the coast for two nights. I love going to the coast, I love traveling and I used to love drinking in new places. I know that it would be a concious decision I would make and that I'm not going to magically look down and find a beer in my hand that will then slowly lift itself to my mouth and force me to drink it. But I'm still scared. A voice just whispered to me that it's inevitable....

To prepare for this: I booked a room right next door to where I'll be working. I'm going to stop before I get to town and pick up a case of soda water and snacks for the room. I will bring books, a sketchbook and my journal. If stuff gets *really* bad I can reach out to my girlfriends, my recovery girlfriends or I can post here.

I'm sorry for the long post but it would be really nice if someone can share their feedback if they have faced such a situation. 
Recently during the lockdown, my appetite for drinking had increased a lot and along with it my weight. 
So I decided to stop drinking and smoking so that I can focus on my health. I stayed at home for 3 weeks and did not have any cravings for both alcohol and cigarette. For 3 weeks I was clean of alcohol and cigarette.
But then my friends made a plan to meet outside. I thought that I will not have alcohol that day but somehow  I let my guard down and decided to have a few beers as rest of my friends were having it and to accompany it, I had a smoke as well. Since then it's been a week and I am clean again and didn't have any cravings. 
How can I resist to have alcohol in such situation? As long as I do not go to such places I am good. But then the social life becomes 0 if I keep on avoiding it. It is quite difficult to sit in such a place for a few hours without having any drinks. Also for me it is difficult to listen to my drunk friends when I am sober.

I have been lurking for a while, but this is my first post. I have a drinking problem and am not sure what to do, as I know I need to quit; however, I am afraid of withdrawals and  am not sure if I am mentally ready yet. 

Just a little background..... My husband and I stopped drinking in 2006 and did not drink a drop until 2016.  My husband and I talked about it and decided to try drinking some wine in 2016.  At first, it was once a week, but later progressed to weekends, and now we are drinking every night.  The difference between myself and my husband is that he is only drinking hard seltzer (5%), while I am going through approximately 1.75L of Vodka every 4 - 5 days along with a few glasses of wine.  I know we both need to stop again; however, I am having a much more difficult time with the alcohol and it is now starting to affect areas of my life.  Previously, I considered myself a functional alcoholic, but now I am realizing that I am not functioning and need to find a way out of this.  Additionally, my husband is still drinking and I don't think he wants to stop.  I quit over the past few years for 4 - 6 weeks at a time (a few times), but one time in particular was scary on Day 2-3 of quitting, to the point that I should have sought medical assistance (heart was racing, tremors, significantly elevated blood pressure).  I am drinking more now than then, which is why I am scared to suddenly just quit. 

Currently, my husband is teleworking due to COVID and has been since March.  I am a Controller for an organization and have been going into work every day.  I am also working on my dissertation for my doctorate degree (Business Administration), which is where I am struggling right now.....I cannot seem to get my thoughts wrapped around all of the requirements and this has never been a problem for me before. I am so far behind. The organization I work for is failing due to effects from COVID-19 and at the same time, I am looking for another job.  I also have a couple of clients that I do accounting work for that I have fallen behind on their work due to everything. I am so depressed right now and I know the alcohol is not helping.  I feel like everything is spinning out of control and I want to put a stop to it, but do not know where to begin. I never drink at work, but as soon as I walk through the door each day, I make myself a drink and it goes on from there until I pass out.

I just want this cycle to stop, but I don't know how to deal with life right now.  All I know is that I was so much happier and at peace when I was sober.  I am working so much overtime, trying to focus on my dissertation (hard to do this with alcohol), trying to find a new job (have gotten some interviews and one coming up next week), trying to get caught up on my client's work, that I cannot just check out for a few days.  I feel at a loss on how to go about quitting. 

I am sorry this is so long. I have not spoken to anyone about this before.  Is there anyone that can offer any guidance or offer suggestions on how to go about quitting, while trying to keep this crazy life together?",12,2

It’s interesting/terrifying how your brain tricks you into believing a few drinks on a Saturday night won’t hurt - that’s what ‘normal’ people do. Then bam 💥 I’m back to making poor choices, acting a hot mess and overall just being a pretty crappy version of myself. There’s something about the 5th day that takes me under every time. However, I am grateful to keep coming back to the same conclusion: Drinking (even just a few) does not benefit me in the slightest. It’s never worth it - even on the toughest days when all I want to do is forget. It steals the joy and robs me of any type of future. It fuels my depression and self hate. It’s not for me. 

I’m finally starting to accept that moderation doesn’t work for me and that’s ok. It’s taken me some time to come to this - I have fought against it tirelessly, wanting so badly to have a ‘normal’ relationship with alcohol. But more and more, I realize that’s simply not possible. 

I love who I am sober. I’m kind and gentle - I put genuine energy, time and care into myself. My inner voice isn’t hurling insults and negativity. I am able to nurture and heal past traumas. I have a motivation for life and actually put my goals into action. All around improvement.

I have had more Day 2’s than I can remember, in fact this is the day I normally just start drinking. I start to feel a little better, the world comes into focus, I get some things done… Clearly l deserve a drink for getting things done, right?

&#x200B;

Sadly, I am not a guy that can have one bottle of wine and call it enough. I am more a 3 bottle kind of guy. Or a bottle of vodka... either option leads to regrettable actions, as I am sure you can imagine.

&#x200B;

The day after is hell. The self hatred, paranoia, the lack of doing anything…

&#x200B;

It’s like I have been stuck in this constant 2 day “Groundhog Day” for most of my late 30’s. With no progression and a gradual decline in most areas of my life. Like death by a thousand self inflicted cuts.

&#x200B;

I have been to rehab, I spent three weeks there. I knew I was not ready to come out but convinced those around me that I was ready. It was quite a considered and well executed process to get my fix that time.

&#x200B;

I have tried AA multiple times. One time with daily meetings and getting to step 5 with my sponsor. At no point did I stop drinking. In fact, all I really got from meetings was a hatred for the arrogant assholes around me and would leave the meetings in dire need of a drink. I kept “going back” for a very long time.

&#x200B;

If I had the option of going into rehab today, I would. However I am fearful of the Coronavirus.

&#x200B;

So, today I try something new. I am being locked in my room from 1000 till 1800. These are my prime craving hours. I want a drink at other times during the day, but this seems to be the time where there is no sense of “me”, just an overwhelming unstoppable urge to drink.

&#x200B;

I have moved all my gadgets and such (PC, Mac, studio equipment, gaming consoles, whiteboard, etc) into this one room. I hope that I will turn to these devices (as I am turning to this writing now) to work my way through the cravings.

And I make so many bad decisions.. I always end up using drugs aswell.. amphetamines were my main problem, but so was weekly drinking..

Today I relapsed, in typical fashion. I can probably say I’m not gonna be the guy here who drinks the most or takes the most drugs.. but I feel like I always end up at square one.. I will never be social without drugs or alcohol.

I don’t know how, and I don’t know why, but I don’t socialize with people, at all.
Everyone i know, the only time i step out of my comfort zone and engage with people is at parties/clubs/drug home parties where atleast alcohol is involved, most likely more. I drink til i puke or i sniff speed so I don’t.. tbh the speed always go up my nose first chance I get when I’m drunk. I didn’t plan on doing it, but now that I’ve had a few beers I don’t give a fuck anyway.

Or to put it this way; I socially isolate myself and cure it by getting drunk on weekends and I’d like to stop.

Infact it starts before this; friday night/saturday. Something in your bones just know you need to get fucked up, go out do stupid shit. 

And to be honest, I hate it. I hate that my life feels like a never ending circle that always ends up with me doing dumb ass shit while drunk&high, reset the clock every sunday to countdown again.

I wish I could find fulfillment in my life, and sociability, that didn’t include me drunk and high.",3,0

I’m still feeling out what this thread should be about. But I think first and foremost, I’d love to know more about you all. Where you’re coming from, what your goals are, and what fitness means (or doesn’t mean!) to you.   

A Tale of AT  

I am mostly a runner, though I cycle and strength train for cross training. Just getting out there years ago, running was the sort of thing I did because …well I knew you had to do something and the years of eating what I want and not gaining weight were coming to an end. I was too poor for gyms and running is pretty cheap to get into. One $120 pair of shoes, a single pair of capri yoga pants scrapped from a thrift shop, and whatever socks and t-shirts I had already and I was ready to go.  

It took years for me to like running though. I hear a lot of people say “oh well I’m not a runner” or “Oh god I hate running” man me too for a long time. Hell, I still hate it somedays! Running, unlike some sports like soccer or football, super sucks when you super suck at it. And I super sucked at it for a long time.  

Historically, I’d sign up for half marathons to keep me motivated to train. If I didn’t have the specter of looking like an assclown in public hanging over my head then I wouldn’t run. Somewhere between training for my 3rd half marathon and my first full marathon, my tune changed and I began to really appreciate and love what my body can do. Suddenly its like running didn’t suck. I was seeing fast times and efforts I was proud of. I’d finish a long run of 15 or 18 miles and sit in the shower and just admire these legs which, through a millennia of evolution have resulted in being able to run great distances without stopping. From arches that collapse to allow the foot to spread and absorb impact to an ankle that allows an inner graceful roll so your leg can transition from being the-leg-in-front to the-leg-in-back with as little energy loss as possible our legs are amazing feats of evolution. I’d sit in the shower and think these thoughts and gently massage my feet or sand down a stubborn bunion.

Shortly after finishing my first full marathon in 2019, I realized when I ran I now played a tape in my head where the crowds cheered and I ran a Boston Marathon qualifying race. All of my adult life I had scrapped, clawed, and survived. Crippling student debt and a stressful career change had taken care of any kind of dream or passion I could ever hope to nurture. How can there be dreams when reality is so fucking hard? And now, like some green shoot of life raising a single brave leaf in the middle of an otherwise barren field was this small dream - that I should run a race that would qualify me for the Boston Marathon. I could race one of the most coveted races in the world alongside some of the top athletes of our generation (okay like mid-pack of this race lets not pretend I’d be up front haha). I realized I had dreams again.  

I think dreams and passion are the ignition to light motivation on fire and in turn burn it away into pure carbonized discipline. Now, I run because I love it. I love celebrating what my body can do. I’m still learning how to treat it correctly (dang shin splints.) and I’m still learning how to push my body’s limits without pushing it into an injury. It’s no longer a thing I do because I grudgingly admit I’m not skinny anymore. I am a runner and an athlete and someday I will stand at the starting line in Boston. :’)  and what comes after Boston? Well there are these other 5 World Marathon Majors around the world...

So that’s me! That is AT’s fitness story in a nutshell. Post your fitness story below and what some of your goals and dreams are. If you’re just starting out or wondering where to even begin, I want to hear that too! I want to hear where you want to go as well as where you are going.",33,0
1208,2020-07-19 05:01:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/htxki0/300_days_sober_today_heres_a_little_bit_of_my/,300 days sober today. Heres a little bit of my story.,"Sorry if this is kind of long. Might be worth a read though.

I'll start here, back in 2018 I got arrested again, this time for fighting with my girlfriend while we were drunk. Shes a bitch and a drunk too so it didn't matter if I treated her like shit. If anything she should go to jail too. But she doesnt. Now I've got something to back up my resentment towards her. 

I sit in jail for awhile and then get out, then go to rehab,then go back to jail. This all takes about 6 months and now its 2019. I'm now a felon and am put on  probation for 2 years. Oh well, I've gotten away with drinking on probation before, I'll do it again. (Spoiler: I didnt get away with it) 

So for the next 9 months I am drinking and getting caught every month, and finally my probation officer tells me it's time for outpatient treatment. This works really well for about 3 days or so. It's all good though cause I dont need help. Fuck everyone right? I'm all good on my own. 

Now that you have a bit of an idea how that time was, let me take you back 10 months ago when the change began:
 I'm laying on my bed at home, liter bottle of vodka next to me. I live with my dad rent free. I basically just mooch off of him and do nothing to improve my life. I'm selfish but I get away with it for the most part. I even stopped showing up to work a few  days ago because I just don't feel like going anymore. 

I had a job that I absolutely hated anyways. I only worked around 15 hours a week and made $8/hr. Pretty much just made enough to buy alcohol and pay my phone bill. I dont have a car and don't pay rent, that's what my parents are for right? 

I'm in a predicament now. I am physically addicted to alcohol and am about to go to jail for a long time. It's all bad for me right now. Then I hear a know at the door. It's my Dad. He tells me he wants to take me to the hospital. Hes worried I'm going to die. 

Something in my gut tells me to give it up. Just go. Stop fighting this. Work with this instead of against it. So I agree. I get up, drink a few more gulps of vodka to stabilize myself and we leave. At this point I'm just along for the ride I guess. I dont know what's really going on too much and I'm just existing. 

We get to the er. My Dad goes inside with me and the nurses take me in a room to see what's up. After some tests and things they decide I need to go to a bigger hospital in a nearby city. So pretty soon I'm in an ambulance on my way there. 

I get there and over the next few days I detox. I have seizures and feel absolutely awful. I hate my life and I see no reason to be alive. It was by far the worst part, but at the same time I was very lucky to have the option of detoxing under medical supervision. 

After 5 or 6 days I get released and guess who is waiting in the hospital lobby. My P.O... he calls a rehab facility right then and there and sets me up to check in at 9am the next morning. This gives me time to pack my things and sleep for 6 hours or so. 

Come the next morning I go. I'm nervous as hell and just want to go back to the comfort of my room and alcohol. When I go into the building I am greeted with open arms. Everyone is very kind. I accept this to be my home for the next 28 days. 

About halfway through I feel on top of the world. I've been sober for 15 days but I'm going to have to go back home sooner than later. That's when I get the opportunity for reintegration. I apply and am accepted shortly after. 

So now I have 2 extra months to get my life together. I get a job working fast food. I learn the bus schedule. I am feeling pretty confident about everything. Come December my time at the facility is coming to an end. That's when I begin to apply for oxford housing. 

I get accepted by a house and move in towards the end of December. I still work this fast food job, but I dont really like it but i make better money than my last place i was at before rehab. I have been networking in the recovery community and have an AA sponsor too. 

Then I get accepted into an even better house. This is when things take off for me. I apply for a new job and get hired a week later. It's better pay and better hours and better location. I finish my outpatient treatment and I get a car (it's just now getting out of winter time so I had been walking everywhere in snow and ice this whole time, or using public transit) 

Now, there's alot that happened that I forgot to mention, such as, I got enrolled for tech school, and it's being paid in full. I quit smoking cigarettes for new years resolution and stuck with it. I began paying off collections and am down from 9 agencies to one now. I began working out and have gained around 15 lbs in the last 3 months. I got a raise recently and make nearly double hourly wage than last year and almost triple the hours. I eat healthier. I save money. And so much more. 

These days I can see the love in my parents eyes, and for the first time I actually realize that they just want what's best for me. They want to see me happy and healthy. They were 'instigators' because they didnt know how to handle me. They did, and do, the best they can. They love me, and they stopped at nothing to help me. I dont know how to pay it back but I know a good start is by staying sober. 

I have one friend who stuck it out through all these years and we are back being friends like the old times again. I was blind to the reason why we drifted apart. It wasnt just 'growing up', it was me being an alcoholic and no fun to be around anymore. 

People look at me as a reliable, good natured person. I am living the life I've wanted for so long. It wasn't always easy and I've had many days I've wanted to give up. But I just kept pushing. Now my life is so much different and it hasn't even been a year yet. 

I do still get depressed at times, but I can manage much better now. Not everything is sunshine and rainbows, but overall it is so worth it. 

If you think you wont benefit *that* much from getting sober, guess again. It's the single most amazing experience I've ever enjoyed. If you read this far, I appreciate your time! Dont ever give up on yourself. Be the change you want to see and make your own luck. IWDWYT!!

Tldr; got sober, life took a 180. Life is great. Dreams come true if you let them.

Ps. Sorry if my writing is kind of shitty, I'm on mobile

Edit: thanks for the kind words everyone. It means alot!

Edit 2: as it was kindly pointed out, I did refer to my ex girlfriend as a bitch. I did believe that in the past during my alcoholism. The disease is ugly and uncaring and the truth can be rather harsh at times, but it would do nobody justice to leave the parts out that may prove offensive",233,0

Part of me is very melancholy though, having a big goal like this was very helpful, but looking at the long term, I'm just a little scared of the forever from here on after. Trying to keep the reasons for being sober in the forefront of my mind though.

Anxious about postpartum.,"I found out at the beginning of February that I was 5-ish weeks along with a little seed-sized embryo. My then partner, now spouse and I were shocked, but both extremely happy when the pregnancy was confirmed. I'd done ""sober January"" as some of you might remember trending, and was already starting to slip back into my old drinking habits just four days into February (lots of gin + sodas, hard seltzers, etc)  when we found out. I've often wondered how I could ever get through pregnancy without drinking, and I'm so grateful it hasn't been as difficult as I imagined it would be -- though I think it's because I'm growing a human inside of me. However, I constantly find myself thinking, ""how will I relate to alcohol after Baby is born?""

My spouse stopped drinking with me for a little bit, but has slowly gotten back into his habits of half a bottle of whiskey + hard seltzers nightly. I've had a very nauseated and fatigued pregnancy, and the idea of drinking alcohol has just felt sickening. But I've been enjoying the effects of not drinking anyway with MUCH lower anxiety + depression, better sleep (except for now being trimester 3), and generally not feeling the pull of alcohol constantly.

I'm worried about how I'll do after pregnancy. I've been following this sub for a few years now and find the stories here relatable, inspiring, and often comforting. And if there's one thing I've learned in my 7 months of pregnancy and following this sub, it's that sobriety is a daily challenge, and it's not glamorous. It's humble, not always the life of the party, and it likes ice cream more than the average person. 

I feel like I should come up with a plan for postpartum...but I'm not sure where to start.

A few anchors, a repaired labrum, two days later and my whole upper body is sore. Feels like I got hit repeatedly with a blunt object! I'm so very glad not to have kept alcohol as an option. I wish that I could be numb for the entirety of my recovery. That would be great, but I'm sticking to my prescribed medications and catching sleep when I can, where I can (I think I've fallen asleep on every piece of furniture in the house lol).

To start, I’d like to explain I am understanding that I may have crossed a line that I can never return from. I was moderating great, but I found it easy to drink a lot as of recently. I have never had withdrawals prior to this week, but after a bender from Sunday to Wednesday, I started to experience withdrawal symptoms for the first time. I am currently finishing up day 3 and moving onto day 4 in 15 minutes. 

I am horrified of the future. I see posts on here about 3 months, 6 months, 2 years relapsing. It’s daunting to think about going that long without alcohol. I fear I don’t have the support I need to get through it and I fear that a relapse will push me into a worse withdrawal and I’ll need medical assistance at that point.

If you guys have any advice for a first time sobernaut, I’d really appreciate it.

Thanks",6,0

Well long story short, growing up my dad was a severe alcoholic and used to beat (not hit, *BEAT)* me and so I grew up with a lot of hatred in my heart for the man.

I recently went to treatment and one of the things I did while there was work on my resentments and chose to let go of the resentment towards my dad... So in turn I've been saying 'Hi' to him and having brief conversations with him here and there.. Keep in mind, before treatment a good day with my dad was if we didn't say a word to each other..

Yesterday when I was laying down and not feeling so hot he came in my room and asked why I wasn't at work and then offered to make me some eggs and bacon.. I told him I didn't want to get him sick so I didn't want to go to the kitchen to eat and he was like I'll just bring it to you in your room. That's LITERALLY never happened in my life... my dad making me food, let alone bringing it to my room for me (he used to hate me eating in my room)... Also, it was a bomb ass omelet with a bunch of ingredients so I know he put some effort into it.

I'm 73 days clean and of course life isn't perfect, but one of the biggest problems in my life, my relationship with my dad, is slowly getting better. All it took was me actively working on my sobriety and trying to do things the right way around the house (which was always hard when you're wasted as all hell every day/night)..

Little thing that might not mean that much to all of you, but to me it showed me that working on myself and being sober really does help the relationships in your life...

I was a *VERY* heavy drinker towards the end of my drinking career that I was up to a half gallon a day... My doctor even notified me that my liver function was abnormal and that I needed to quit drinking ASAP! Like I said... I'm only 26!

I got so bad into my addiction that even a few hours after waking up I'd start having withdrawal symptoms (severe tremors, sweating bullets, nausea, dry mouth, etc.)... Well I remember one time after going through a big multi-day binge of half-gallons daily I decided to try and quit. Well the next day I felt weird, as in my body felt drunk (I felt weird walking) but my mind didn't feel drunk. This girl asked me to hang out and at first I really didn't want to because I was withdrawing but I eventually said yes... Well its times like that why I believe that 'everything happens for a reason'... While hanging out with this girl we went to walmart, walked around for about 5 minutes and from what she told me I just said ""I feel dizzy"" and I collapsed, hit my head on some shelves on the way down and proceeded to have a roughly 4 minute seizure which resulted in me biting my tongue really hard and muscle damage. The reason I say everything happens for a reason is because if I hadn't left my house that day, I probably would have been laying down on my back when the seizure happened and very well may have swallowed my tongue. Remember that the reasons for things happening aren't always apparent right away, sometimes those reason come forward days, weeks, months, years, decades later... But everything indeed *does* happen for a reason.

Also a friend of mine had a friend who recently also tried to quit alcohol cold turkey and suffered a heart attack as a result and lost his life...

My point is, if you have a *severe* alcohol problem and get withdrawals such as tremors when you don't drink... **PLEASE** detox safely at a hospital or detox center that has medical assistance.

I wish everyone good luck on their sobriety, just start the process safely :)",59,0

Our kids play together, I am friends with her ex's new girlfriend, it's complicated and it was probably hard for her to reach out to me.

My rationale was that since July 1rst I 've had 2 beers, which is a huge improvement over my daily drinking from before. Also, weed is my biggest vice, and I feel I haven't replaced weed with alcohol. 

The can was slightly chilled, but the beer was warm. It didn't taste all that good. I definitely felt the effects. I didn't like the effects.

So next time I will bring club soda, cherry syrup and kombucha , my go-to drink these days. Now that the awkwardness of our situation is dissipated, I'll just tell her I quit drinking. 

I truly felt the poison in the beer. I don't want the poison.  For someone who always liked to be a bit fucked up all the time, this is truly revolutionary.

It wasn’t perfect - there were a few hiccups during the day. Family was a little tough, there were technical difficulties, and we had to be very mindful of social distancing and staying physically apart.  Despite some challenging factors, I said no to two gifted bottles of champagne, complimentary champagne in the room and at dinner, and plenty of other tempting drinks during the day. I sipped my Tost and Nosecco and remember every moment of the evening, including falling asleep happy.  I remember saying my vows and the taste of my awesome mini wedding cake!

I have severe PMDD - pre menstrual dysphoric disorder. It’s like the worst PMS you can imagine, fed enough steroids to turn into the Hulk and given enough methamphetamine to kill an elephant. Imagine the Hulk on meth, but in your brain. 

Basically this means that for two weeks out of every month I am a completely different person. Incoherent rage, severe depression, extreme difficulty correctly perceiving the actions and intentions of others, completely unable to take even basic care of myself, self-harm including punching and slapping myself, hard enough to leave bruises and lumps. as a teenager before I was diagnosed, I used to get admitted to a psych facility once a month every month like clockwork. 

Then I get my period and it all completely disappears. I’m like Jekyll and Hyde. It sucks. I deal with it. Sorry, I’m not in a great mood today. 

This disorder played a huge role in my drinking getting  so out of control. Even when i was drinking at my absolute peak, I could sort of moderate during my two good weeks. As in, I could call it at 6-7 beers a day. During my two bad weeks I would reliably go completely off the rails with the drinking - like a fifth of vodka and 12 beers per day average. I had absolutely no control over myself. Then the cycle resets, and I try my hardest to moderate and cut back for two weeks until everything falls apart again.

Now that I’m on the sober side of things, I can see that drinking through the bad part of the cycle wasn’t really helping anything at all, in fact the opposite. Rageful, depressed, self-loathing, already out of control AND drunk? Yes. Genius move, Easy. Drinking helped numb everything for a little while...until I would tip over the edge into ‘too drunk’ and reliably have a complete meltdown almost every single night of my bad weeks. It’s a literal miracle that my husband still loves me. 

I swore to myself I would get through 30 days of sobriety before I even considered anything else. I specifically quit right after my period ended so I would have as many good days as possible under my belt before the bad weeks hit. But oh god, how do I do this?

Anyone have tips for navigating sobriety while fighting severe mental illness? Especially if you know that you just need to white knuckle it for two weeks and you’ll feel better? Any period-having people in here who also have PMDD? 

Help. The next two weeks are going to be my make or break.",2,0

I cheated on husband with alcohol. The more I think about it, it was not so different from an affair. The lies. The empty promises. The selfishness.  The immediate satisfaction I sought out.


And SO stayed. If SO had an affair I do not know if I would have stayed.  That guilt fills me up. 

SO asked what clicked. 

So now when I am tempted I just ask myself how I would feel if SO cheated. I can't be a cheater anymore.

It became very clear lately that I’m a little over my group of friends. It hit me how immature they are, even though I love them all so much, all they do is keep the party going, on and on, constantly. I feel like COVID made me see how much they don’t care for people, they are not respectful of any rules or anybody. I decided to distance myself from them, because I’m taking this virus seriously but also because I feel they don’t want to understand what I’m going through. They are not doing any work on themselves and clearly don’t understand what process I’m in. 
As much as I love them, that’s not the kind of people I want to surround myself with right now. 

I don’t know how to find new and sober friends.

Before the coronavirus, I would always drink my night away, but now ever since March....I've been drinking morning noon and night. My gf had a long talk with me about how she will leave me....that doesn't phase me because I never had much luck with women in my 38 years of living. Been engaged in a relationship prior for 9 years. So I hide my bottles when she visits me and can't tell you how many nights we have been out and I am able to function normally, but don't remember a thing. I am worried now because I tried getting off it and was successful for 3 days, but what happens is I feel like I have to cough more often when sober. I feel worried about the virus and when I get these feelings....I take 3 shots at first to calm me down......and it always works....even so as I'm typing this. 

I do have a full-time job, but not in the summer....and my other part time job laid me off due to coronavirus. So I have more free time than I prefer. 

Is there any advice on how to fight the anxiety when not drinking? I hate this......I had less anxiety being in Iraq. 

I always feel like I need to cough....when I'm not drinking I just suck on cough drops all day. 

I am going to continue to try to stay dry.....I just can't believe this has become of me.

I am comparing their narrative to mine and subconsciously trying to convince myself that I don't have a serious problem with alcohol and can start drinking again.

I have not hurt loved ones more than a handful of times, I have had no legal issues, I have not lost a job and when I drink I can hold it together to not be abusive to my partner and child. I don't socialise and do all my drinking at home so I don't embarrass myself or have  frequent confrontations. Work is an inconvenience that gets in the way of my consumption. 

I have however drank every day for over fifteen years, gotten sober for a year and fallen back into the same pattern for the last five years. Drinking more and more, later and later, earlier and earlier, when I am happy, when I am sad, when it is sunny, raining or snowing, when I am well or sick. I promise myself every night no more, even pouring a token gesture down the sink, nearly in tears but buy alchohol again the very next day. 

Alchohol consumes me, I think about it all the time and plan everything around it. I berate and loathe myself because of it and  persuade myself not to quit drinking all in the same thought loop. A constant inner debate between sober and drunk me, it is utterly exhausting. 

I manipulate those around me into accommodating my habit by making an effort around the house, cooking meals and cleaning so that I (in my mind) can't be called out about my drinking and deflect attention from it. I sit on my own away from my family drinking for hours and hours on end. I encourage my partner to go to bed early to get a good night sleep when really all I want is to be left alone to get as sloppy drunk as I can without having to keep it together or having judgemental eyes upon me. 

I have had a couple of mini breakdowns over the years suffering ever present chronic anxiety and have been taking antidepressants long term. I have had to go to CBT and am  constantly trying work on and improve my mental health. Drinking is the absolute worst thing I can do in this regard but unfortunately I have a self destruct fetish it would seem. 

Yet  despite all of the above when I read other people's stories on SD I feel like a fraud being on here. I am telling myself that I am not as bad as them. I haven't done the things that they have, they would laugh at me for being on here. I am an attention seeker, not a proper alcoholic. I can start drinking again, I just need to suck it up, stop being a bitch. 

I am writing this to see the absurdity of that thought and be able to read it back to myself.

The night of my 21st birthday, my friends took me to a bar and my first drink was a tequila sunrise.  It tasted like shit.  But within a minute or two I was feeling more calm, relaxed, and just _better_ than I ever remembered feeling before in my life.  No wonder people drank this foul liquid!  It was a magical elixir.  I had three more drinks that night.

Within a few months, I was drinking 195 proof Everclear.  From a handle.  Nightly.  I _always_ drank for effect and so it just made sense to find the hardest-hitting alcohol possible and drink as little ""filler"" as possible.  Blackouts and passing out were my norm.  I figured that was what happened to everyone.  Who wouldn't drink like that?  It felt incredible!  I kept this up through the rest of college, got straight A's, and headed out west to California for a great new job.

I quickly met my future wife and we partied hard through our 20s.  But she wasn't much of a home-drinker, so I curtailed my drinking and just binged when we went out.  I had a lot of principals and rules around drinking -- no drinking on the job, no drinking and driving, no drinking without my girlfriend if I was home, stay functional.  I only broke these rules a handful of times.

I got married, got a big house, had a wonderful son, got a new, better job, had another wonderful son.  I had everything I'd dreamed of.  And I was miserable.

I did not adapt to fatherhood well.  Here were two tiny, beautiful souls in my care and I spent almost every second of everyday just trying not to yell and scream.  I was just _angry_ and I didn't know why.  After a many, many months of dealing with my tantrums, my wife suggested I see a therapist.  I learned that I was terrified of being a bad father and, as some sort of sick self-fulfilling prophecy, that fear drove me into tirades.  I picked up Cognitive Behavioral Therapy tricks to assuage my anxiety-induced rages.  I started some anti-depressents to help with my mood.  I felt _much_ better.  But my marriage seemed strained, my life was overwhelming to me.

My solution was to start having some wine after the kids went to bed.  First a few glasses, soon half a bottle, then the whole bottle, then a bottle and nightcaps.  Within a few months I was sneaking long pulls from a handle of vodka I kept in the garage between drinks I had while on the couch next to my wife.  I started drinking ""nightcaps"" before starting bedtime routine with my kids.  I felt more relaxed, more fun, more funny.  I was happy drunk dad.  I was finally not yelling (most of the time).

My eldest needed someone to co-sleep with and my wife needed her rest, so I ""selflessly"" volunteered to sleep in the guest room and so my son could crash in the bed with me when he woke up in the middle of the night.  I quickly turned that guest room into my own den of iniquity, stashing bottles of warm vodka and copious amounts of cannabis around the room.  I got high and drunk every night, drinking to black out while watching endless movies and TV shows that glamorized and helped me rationalize my drinking.  I was scared because I'd lost control, but I was determined to keep it to myself as I tried to find way to slow down.  I worked meticulously to hide this all from my wife.  I would usher everyone to bed earlier and earlier so I could start my nightly binge.  I lived for alcohol and everything else in my life became an annoying obstacle to my drinking and using.

I lost my ability to drink normally.  When I'd go out to socialize, I'd end up blacking out, often before the event even _started_ and would find myself back home (via Uber) having no idea how I got there or what happened.  That was scary, so I just stayed home as much as I could, isolating myself from any friends and opting out of any event I could.  My sole focus was on my next drink.

In June of 2018, I started serving myself wine at dinner, followed by nightcaps as dessert.  I started blacking out before my kids were even upstairs for their nightly routine.  In late June, I came to from a blackout standing in my son's room, yelling hateful things at his sobbing, 5-year-old face.  When I realized what was happening, I began sobbing and apologizing.  The next day I decided I needed to pump the brakes on my drinking until I figured out what was wrong.  A week of sobriety went by and I figured I was good to go, so I started dinner off with some wine again.  I came to from a black out, yelling once again at my son, followed by sobbing and apologizing.  

This was my rock bottom.  I wasn't happy drunk dad.  Drinking somehow turned me into angry drunk dad.  Alcohol broke our contract.  It was supposed to make me a happy dad and here it was turning me into a monster.  If I was going to be angry drunk dad, then I was going to stop being any kind of drunk dad.

I knew I needed to stop drinking, but had no idea how.  I think I googled ""how to stop drinking"" and /r/stopdrinking was one of the top hits.  I was already into Reddit, so I started to peruse SD.  And my world changed.

I found post after post after post of people sharing their fears, uncertainties, shameful secrets, struggles, confusion, sadness, despair.  They drank like I did.  They were lost like I was.  They were terrified about their futures.  It was like I was reading my own journal, written by complete strangers.

But the true treasure lay below each post, in the comments.  Encouragement, compassion, love, understanding, commiseration, sympathy, and hope flowed from the community under each post.  I couldn't fathom how people who were struggling like me could show so much love and kindness.  But I soaked it in.  I lurked for weeks, too scared to post.  

I was staying ""sober"" by continuing to smoke pot each night, but I vowed I would not touch alcohol.  Each morning I would wake up and ask myself ""is today the day I can stop drinking _forever_"".  I'd feel abject terror and sometimes even vertigo at the thought.  But I thought that was the promise I had to make in order to ""stay sober"".

I started adding comments to posts, mimicking the compassion I saw from others, offering support where I could.  I just did it as practice, just to try to be encouraging.  Over the weeks, I started to see how I could speak to _myself_ with that same kind of compassion and that self-kindness loosened the grip alcohol had on me.

I learned that I did not have to promise myself to _never_ drink again, but that I only had to promise I wouldn't drink _today_.  That was a much less terrifying and much more achievable goal.  It's the same goal I aim for today, each day.

By September, I was done with everything.  I set down my vaporizer one Friday night and never picked it up again.  I was free from alcohol and pot.  I was euphoric.  Now I just needed to let my wife know.

I thought she would be delighted to hear that I'd beaten addiction, by myself, without troubling her with it.  I came clean to her about all the sneaky drinking, the pot smoking, the den of iniquity, the black outs, and explained that I was clean and sober and ready to rejoin my family and my marriage with complete focus.

It's been two years since that moment and I'm still not sure if I didn't destroy my marriage right then and there.  She was _completely_ shocked.  I'd hidden my life better than I thought, and she was paying less attention than I suspected.  What I did was layout years of pathological betrayal at her feet in a short, 15 minute confession and destroyed her trust in me, our marriage, and herself.

Chaos ensued for months.  She demanded I join a recovery program, despite my feeling that I had already found sobriety my own way and needed nothing else.  I tried SMART, Refuge Recovery, and AA, thinking I needed none of them.  But something kept compelling me to return to them.  Despite being a staunch introvert, I found the human connection to be enticing.  After a couple of months, I settled on one program that resonated most with me and I've been working it _hard_ ever since.

I've relapsed a couple of times, not on alcohol, but on a few drugs.  Both times were very short departures from sobriety, 22 seconds and ~45 minutes.  I came back to sobriety immediately, reset my badge, and kept moving forward.  I simply love my life in sobriety to stay away from it.  I've had drinking dreams, and they feel just as awful as an actual relapse while they are going on, and then I wake up and get my gift of sobriety returned to me and I'm filled with gratitude.  I'm thankful for those dreams for reminding me of how precious my sobriety is to me.

Home life has remained tense, but continues to improve.  Life has its ups and downs, but I'm learning to take them in stride.  For me, there's a huge distinction between sobriety and _recovery_.  Sobriety simply means I'm not drinking.  But all those problems in my life that I used to rationalize my drinking are still there.  Sobriety didn't wave a magic wand and make all that go away.  But it did give me the time, attention, and clarity to do something different with my life -- work on my recovery. Sobriety was removing the shackles of alcohol.  Recovery has been stepping out of the dungeon and into the warm sunlight.

In recovery, I've picked up guided meditation, reading recovery literature, staying active in my program and /r/stopdrinking, reaching out to friends and loved ones, attempting regular exercise, being present with my children, and rediscovering my joy of learning new things.  I continue to take my anti-depressants and attend weekly therapy sessions.  In recovery, I'm finally feeling like I'm in a position to affect positive changes in my life by simply _trying_.  

I can't imagine navigating this pandemic if I was still drinking.  My recovery has afforded me the opportunity to grow as a parent, a husband, and a person.  Each day is full of challenges, but recovery has taught me to see them as opportunities and to see my failures as chances to learn.  I'm present and, most times, patient with my children.  We are bonding in a way that I never imagined we could.  Were I still drinking, I'd be shoving them away at any chance for fear they would come between me and my bottle.

On top of my program, I've stayed close to /r/stopdrinking.  It was the place I got sober and I will be forever in the community's debt.  Sadly, out of about 10 people who got sober around the same time I did, people I soon made friends with, only two are still around, the rest have disappeared, and only one has completely avoided relapse.  Finding and holding onto sobriety isn't always easy.  It's actually really hard at times.  But, for me, the effort I spend staying sober pales in comparison to the effort I used to put into hiding my drinking, lying to and manipulating my loved ones, and fruitlessly wrestling with alcohol.

I'm beyond grateful for my sobriety today.  My life today is completely different from how it was when I was drinking.  But not a lot has changed on the outside.  I still have the wife, the house, the boys, the job.  I have the things I always dreamed of.  But nowadays, I'm _content_ instead of miserable.  I put down the bottle, I found this community, I stayed sober, and I worked on my recovery.  Turns out the only thing that really needed to change was me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Some of the things that I've heard happen when we choose to stop drinking:

&#x200B;

\*Freedom instead of fear

&#x200B;

\*Acceptance instead of intolerance

&#x200B;

\*Serenity instead of turmoil

&#x200B;

\*Peace instead of discord

&#x200B;

\*Strength instead of self pity

&#x200B;

\*Community instead of isolation

&#x200B;

\*Generosity instead of selfishness

&#x200B;

\*Security instead of instability

&#x200B;

\*Insight instead of ignorance

&#x200B;

\*Faith instead of doubt

&#x200B;

All of these things can be ours, and it all starts when we choose not to drink. Thanks for reading, and much love to everyone here.

Been an alcoholic 40 years, but I'm sober now and it feels very good, losing weight (got 15k/33lb to lose) eating healthy, exercising, relationships are so much better.

The company I work for is going broke and a new job may be hard to find and my kids have all left home now, so it's all a bit sad, but I'm sober and my partner and I are just taking one day at a time.

It's not magic, it's not easy, I still want a drink at certain times, there are very strong triggers that push me close to the bottle, but it's holding for now. 

I don't know if I'll fail, I'm not focusing on the number of days too much as that's a mistake for me, but I'm mindful of the continuation of remaining sober is very important for my survival.

I don't think anyone can truly understand the strength and commitment it takes for an alcoholic to stop drinking, someone said to me once ""just don't drink, it's not like you're on heroin"" well, I've never been on heroin, but alcohol is a devil of an addiction for me!!

Anyway I just wanted to say that I'm proud of us all, if you're reading this and sober then you should be proud, I know I am.

Stay strong, keep going, if it's your first day or a lot of days, that's a good thing....maybe the best of things.

I just had the most vivid dream I was drinking and stayed at a friends and drove the next morning. Somehow got pulled over and charged with a DUI. I was so worried if they found out about my previous DUI while traveling abroad last year the charges would be soooo much worse. I couldn't understand how even after a night of sleeping it off I was still drunk. I was so upset I did this again after promising myself I never would. Then I woke up... 

I don't know how long I cried after that. So grateful I was sober and it wasn't real. I've made so many mistakes while blackout drunk that I never want to repeat. This just cemented my current path to stay sober. 

I hit rock bottom on vacation last year in New Zealand. Got pulled over for a drink driving offense I barely remember. It was a mostly an emotionally traumatizing experience. The only big things I had to deal with were a fine and a ruined vacation. But the painful event has made me a better person determined to be sober.

I have been mostly sober since. A couple slip ups, but my sister has helped me stay accountable, as have you all... and therapy.

Also, I told myself I would forgive myself if I messed up instead of feeling like a failure, which leads to giving up.

1 month later, today is my birthday.  I probably drank this month what I used to drink in 4 or 5 days.  But after sticking to a diet and working out 5 days a week, I'm down 19 pounds.  My sleep, energy, mood, productivity, strength, and just general happiness is sooooo much better now.  My house is cleaner, my bills are all paid early, I started playing music again.  I have moderately sever psoriasis, and it's better than it's been in years.  I forgive myself for my few slip ups.

I read early on during this the idea of ""Make your life better 1% better every day.""  That really made sense to me, and has helped me reframe alot of my struggles.  So yeah, there it is.  Woohoo.

No real particular reason, I just decided not to.  Then the next day I felt the same way and it's been like that sense.  I've had cravings, sure, but I know if I ever want to be with my husband again, I need to get this shit under control and STOP.  Speaking of my husband, (see my previous posts about his story regarding needing a liver transplant at age 33) he was officially discharged from the hospital today! :D <3  He was in there Feb 23-July 17.  Holy shit.  So now my determination is stronger than ever to kick booze's butt!  

I've been reading this amazing book called We Are The Luckiest by Laura McKnowen which has helped immensely.  I've also been attending her online support meeting called The Luckiest Club, or TLC for short, every day since March (highly recommend joining!  It's only $9/mo).  I up the hard stuff (vodka)   
 in April, but was still having a glass or few of diluted wine at night.  While I liked to think of myself as sober then, since I never got actually drunk, I knew I was really only kidding myself.  Now I've stopped that as well and it feels SO good to not be a ""faux sober (fauxber? lol)"" right now.  Last Friday  I told myself ""ok, that was a good week, I'll celebrate with a glass tomorrow""  Low and behold Sat came and went without a drop.  So did this past week.  Today I was like ""ok, tomorrow is The Day, 2 weeks sober, that's pretty kick ass for a first try, I deserve a treat."" Then I saw his post on FB this morning about getting out and said ""fuck that!  I'm gonna go for my first 30 day chip!""   I can't wait to tell him how he helped me without knowing it from afar.  

As such, I still haven't/can't communicate with him so I'll continue to wait until he is ready.  I did comment on his post, no response yet but that's ok.  My new mantra still stands: ""If 2020 has taught me anything, it's patience."" 

So I guess ""Friday the 13th"" is a lucky day for me! \^\_\_\^

1323,2020-07-17 20:33:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ht7ec9/the_future_is_now/,The future is now.,"Hi everyone!

I have not been around much the past couple of weeks. I've done the weekly Acts Of Kindness posts on Monday and read the responses, and that's pretty much been it.

Part of the reason why is that I have a lot of practical life stuff to take care of right now, and I'm trying to stay focused so I can make some progress on those things. The other reason is that I've been putting a lot of time into my real world sobriety support groups, and I'm a little tapped out.

I'm in AA, and throughout the pandemic people I know in the program have made comments to the effect that they wonder how many people are going to get sober as a result of all of this. The answer is that a lot of people are, and they're getting sober now. They're not waiting until this is all over to get sober, people are hitting bottom and getting sober right now.

I'm in an area where AA meetings are still mostly happening on Zoom, but some meetings are back in person, with limited capacities and other safety measures in place (face masks, etc.) The meetings that are held in churches and hospitals seem to be staying on Zoom. The real life meetings are happening at Alano clubs and other dedicated recovery spaces.

I'm back at meetings because I need in person meetings - I live alone, and it was damaging to me to spend that much time by myself. I'm an alcoholic, isolating feels very natural and safe to me, but it will kill me. My head goes to bad places when I spend huge amounts of time on my own, and that'll inevitably lead me back to drinking. It won't happen overnight, but we're already.... four months into social distancing? Something like that. And it's not going away anytime soon. A year on my own almost all of the time would kill me.

So I'm back in meetings. I would be doing this anyway, because like I said, I know for a fact that I need to take care of my sobriety and stay connected to other people in recovery or my alcoholism will very definitely end up killing me. If I drink again, I don't think that I'd be able to stop before I suffered life destroying and probably life ending consequences. Every time I've relapsed it got worse, and I had a harder time quitting. I don't think that I have another recovery in me, so I take care of the recovery I have.

I think I already got the virus back in March, although my antibody test was inconclusive (I had some antibodies, but not enough to be definite, but it was three months later, so.... who knows.) So I maybe have some protection from it? Which makes it a little bit of a different situation for me. But I'd be doing it anyway because I have to.

Once I started going to meetings and realized just how many newly sober people were showing up, that shifted my motivation. As with everything else in recovery, I started off doing it for totally self-centered reasons, and then I realized that I had something to share that other people need. I think that I've been to somewhere around five or six meetings on the First Step in the past three weeks (which are commonly done when it's someone's first ever AA meeting), and pretty much every meeting has a sizeable percentage of people in their first couple of months of sobriety. People getting sober as a result of the pandemic isn't something theoretical that might happen in the future, it's already happening right now.

There aren't a lot of people with significant time in sobriety showing up to in person meetings. The people who *are* showing up are the people who need meetings, many of whom are newly sober. There's a lot of need for support in meetings right now. People were there for me when I showed up to AA, so I’m showing up for others as much as I can right now.

Anyway, that's where I'm at, y'all. Things will simmer down and I'll be back here on the regular sometime in the near future. Sending hugs and love to all my SD peeps, keep fighting the good fight. 💜💜💜

Also, frustrations with the Healthcare System","**TLDR: I drink a little too much, sought help, and was only offered heavy treatment. Makes me feel like there's no place for folks who just need a little help.**

&#x200B;

Hey  there friends, thanks for reading. I'm your typical ""invisible"" alcohol abuser, I drink like 3-5 drinks alone every night (+ binging a little at hangouts), hold my alcohol well, and don't let my problem affect others directly.

I've been drinking too much for years, mostly alone, mostly to force my brain to be quiet after a day of push push push. I love using alcohol as an off-switch- unfortunately its one that's slowly chewing up my liver, getting in the way of developing relationships, leaving me a wreck in the mornings, etc.

I've tried to moderate for a long time. I used every system I could think of: tracking daily drinks, setting weekly or monthly limits, only drinking with friends, and others. None of this worked in the long term, unfortunately. So about a week ago I decided I'd do a 3 month sobriety kick and see how it felt. I'm 5 days sober today (woo!) and its going pretty well.

I wanted more support (accountability, counseling, direction to resources) so I called my insurance to see if they could point me in the right direction. I'm on OHP (Oregon Medicaid). They gave me numbers of recovery centers without giving me any personalized direction. I called one, Cascadia, and they set me up to have an appointment with a clinician today.

I was really looking forward to this appointment, as an opportunity to talk about my journey, get validation that I have a problem and that there's a way out, and get pointed toward resources. Maybe I'd even get some therapy surrounding my underlying problems so I could start to heal. Unfortunately, the first thing my clinician did was ask me to agree to weekly UA's and 1hr group therapy twice a week. He said these were requirements for treatment and that I wouldn't be able to continue without agreeing to them.

I'm pretty uncomfortable with monitored UA's (especially during COVID), and they definitely seem unnecessary for me. I also didn't like the ""total sobriety or nothing"" mentality, and didn't think I'd have time for 2hrs of group therapy a week. I can see how this is an appropriate system for other folks, but it felt like way too much for me. I was looking for more like, biweekly counseling with group therapy recommendations or something.

I told my clinician all this, that it probably wasn't a good fit. He left me with the names of AA and Smart Recovery, and that was that. I don't blame him at all, but I was left feeling really disappointed in the system. It seems like its set up to funnel people into it after they've got a DUI/hit rock bottom, and not focused on preventative care at all.

I wish that initial appointment would have been about hearing where I was, and giving me the level of care I needed instead of forcing me in a really invasive box that would have just made me feel super out of place. Now I've gotta go back to the drawing board, organizing group meetings and regular therapy sessions myself, without any outside help. I can't help but worry that most people drop off at this point, or tell themselves their problem isn't bad enough to warrant change. Not until they hurt somebody and a court orders them to change, at least.

Anyway, thanks for reading my absurdly long intro. Looking forward to hanging out in this community a bit, this seems like a place with great vibes. Maybe chatting with you folks can help fill that gap for me.

I'm not too concerned about consuming sugar. Over all I've been eating healthier and going for daily walks and or jogs. Occassionally, I'll get an itch for some sugar, but it's really not anymore than I would normally eat.

I had been evicted and gotten my car repossessed in previous years. I went to bed every night fearful I would die in my sleep. I hadn't been to a doctor or dentist in over 10 years. I had my last drink on July 17, 2015. 

In those 5 years, I lost over 200 pounds and was able to register to be a potential bone marrow donor, in memory of my Dad who died of CLL. I went to the dentist and got much needed dental work (I was missing a tooth close to the front and hadn't smiled with my teeth in years). I managed to start working again. I got on a plane in the first time in 18 years and went on a dream trip to Europe (literally with the money I saved from not drinking). I started dating again. And most recently, I got really brave and started therapy. My relationship recently ended, and I'm dealing with some highly stressful situations currently, but I'm not drinking to get through them. 

Life still gets hard but it's so much better without alcohol. Good luck and much love to anyone out there struggling. It's really hard but I believe in you. You can do it.

I have had a string of failed attempts at a romantic relationship, they all failed primarily due to alcohol. The loneliness has made me really desperate for human connection, but the shame I feel keeps me secluded and I drink to numb the pain of shame and isolation. I have a mother who I am close with but we have a sometimes tense relationship. My twin sister committed suicide 10 years ago when she was drunk. My little brother is in prison due to drugs. I have a 10 year old daughter who I love very much but who reminds me of my own failures because she can see how I don’t have any friends and I drink too much, she’s old enough that I now see the look of disappointment on her face when I start drinking. I want to hide from it.  

 

I guess where I am going with this is, I know AA can offer me a solution for at least re-introducing myself back into a social network, maybe give me a few chances at trying to form friendships. But, I have to admit I hate AA. I have tried to make it work for 7 years, but going into the rooms after a few months of sobriety feels very depressing to me, and I usually go back out because the idea that I have to do this for the rest of my life is distressing to the point that I cannot continue to go to meetings. I loathe the monotony, the condescending tone of “make your higher power a door knob”. I know these little pieces of advise are well intended but AA really feels like Hell to me.

 

I feel that if AA has not worked for me, and I keep trying to make it work I will be on this carousel of relapse forever. I feel very strongly that the drinking stems from the shame of feeling socially incompetent and being frustrated to the point of despair over the fact that I don’t know how to form the relationships I need to meet my basic social and emotional needs.

 

To the people that have had social troubles like me, but who AA also does not work for, I want to ask after you became sober, how did you make friends again?",7,0

I have not had a drink in 112 days. I initially stopped drinking because I was stuck in my small NYC apartment during quarantine and hated the idea of waking up with a hangover to be left alone with my feelings and anxiety all day.  I also started on an SSRI back in October which made me kind of have a ""distaste"" for alcohol in general.  

I am loving this sober lifestyle and can now see that I had a problem.  I was definitely on a bad track, especially when it came to binge drinking. If I woke up hungover, I would sometimes have another drink (""It's a mimosa, it's fine!"") to take the edge off.  I even had pancreatitis back in 2018 which was likely caused by a weekend of drinking and eating like crap.  

I kind of feel like a fraud being in this group because I don't have cravings or the desire to drink right now (which I think is from the SSRI I am on).  However, I am scared the desire to drink will come back when social outings become more frequent or if I go off my medicine.

From the minute I woke up this morning I was talking myself into getting wine for tonight. I tried to ignore the voice and went about my day. I had a crappy day in work so about mid-afternoon that voice came back. I looked at my sober app, looked at the days I’ve racked up. I read here. It still didn’t shut the hell up. I played the tape forward (no plans tomorrow so was a tricky one to try and use the hangover as a reason), I justified the ‘treat’ to myself. It’s Friday. I’ve earned it. All the usual shit. 

I had to go shopping and on the way there my mind was constantly battling. I was in a right bad mood when I got to the supermarket. I duly went around picking up what I needed, I left the wine aisle until last. I was convinced I was going to drink and just as I got there, I spotted a mate I haven’t seen since lockdown. He’s seen me at my worst drunk, a sobbing mess. Lashing out at those around me. But he’s a brilliant friend and has always been there for me. At that moment I realised how ashamed I’d be if he saw me with a couple of bottles of wine in my trolley. Especially when just a few days ago, I told him I was trying to cut back and live a healthier lifestyle. 

In that instant, I whirled around and got out of the wine aisle. I met up with him elsewhere in the store. And afterwards I chucked in a load of chocolate to treat myself to later.

Today marks my first attempt at going sober. I’ve considered it but was able to moderate for quite some time.

I’m thinking my withdrawal will be fairly mild, but I’ll keep an eye on it. 

Wanted to share a couple things. 

1. My buddy came over just before my day 1 completion. He did not come empty handed. He came with a 12 pack and a bottle of tequila. I was actually a little grossed out by the thought of drinking after going through one day of withdrawals. So, I’m proud I said no.

Sundays are typically my only day off, I’ll spend them cleaning the house, doing laundry, preparing food to eat throughout the week, and a bit of R&R sprinkled in. Every now and then I’ll get a weekday off, or finish working early in the day. I know it sounds crazy but it’s those days that mess with my head the most.

I’m early in sobriety so I’m hoping that this problem buffs itself out with time, but I feel lost when I don’t have a task laid out before me.

I have been so much happier since I’ve cut drinking out.  I’ve been processing a lot of emotions I suppressed with alcohol but I’m enjoying the process of crying or feeling angry and actually working through those emotions instead of burying them.  

One thing that has become clear through my sobriety is that my relationship was completely centered around alcohol.  In fact I’m now realizing booze was all me and my boyfriend have in common.  We’ve been together three years.  We were both very busy people who had very little time together.  When we were together, it was time to get fucked up.  With Covid, we’ve been around each other a lot more.  There was even an uptick in drinking that was linked to my realization that I had to quit.  

Now that the drinking is gone (he’s been abstaining too) I am afraid I don’t even love him.  We have nothing in common whatsoever.  He doesn’t get me at all.  He wants us to stay together but I don’t know if that’s because he truly loves me or he we are just so bound by life things (live together, own pets together) that he’d rather not the trouble of ending it .

It’s to the point where everything he says and does annoys me.  I think there’s a lot of resentment on my end.  For instance, he was more in control of his drinking and id get completely hammered blackout drunk.  We’d have sex like that.  He never expressed concern even when I had so many nights where I was so sick the next day I vomited uncontrollably and was riddled with so much anxiety.

Wife is working full time and I mentioned this before floated the idea of quitting her job to homeschool our kids which is a financial disaster, will result in a meltdown of everyone because my wife actually isn't suited to be a full time SAHM and homeschooler (she will lose her mind and everyone will suffer). 

After fighting and talking in circles we agreed to ""look at both getting a nanny full time when summer ends (our summer sitter is leaving) ""and she agreed to look into homeschooling and what it would mean professionally to take a leave to do this at her job (my guess: they'll happily terminate her since it's a damn pandemic and a recession is looming if not already here).

My wife also offers to reach out to former colleagues (she was a teacher) for potential nanny contacts: she never does.

So, I go ahead and put an ad out. Get two candidates who seem ok. Do the phone screening interview. Ask wife if she wants to talk to them. She hems and haws and delays until she says we both should (fine). I reach out and both accepted jobs elsewhere. So, I am back to searching for a nanny.

Meanwhile, my wife has basically googled homeschooling curriculum and talked about that we need to create a learning space (read: spend money and time reorganizing the basement) for the kids. She hasn't spoken to her job. She's done nothing else. She does not know how to manage when we cut off all of the things that her working supports: (1) excellent health insurance; (2) savings; (3) home services like weekly cleaners; and (4) expensive hobbies like crafting, and (5) any extras like a vacation, etc. We are going to have to be incredibly frugal to make things work. She hasn't thought about how she would manage with very limited personal time and being ""on"" all the time for the kids (a problem during our first SAHM experiment).

And here's the annoying thing. She claims I make all of the decisions and railroad things through in our lives. But really...I am the only one who is actually doing ANYTHING when there's a problem. I am the one trying to find a solution. She is defaulting into there's no solution to justify quitting her job and going on this disaster of an idea (which she admits is a terrible idea and that she will likely crack if she homeschools and quits working). This pattern occurred with every big decision in our marriage. 

For years, I have internalized things. I drank heavily to numb things. I got into a mess of a bulimic cycle to deal with the stress and anxiety. I am not doing that. I am feeling the way I feel. I know it will pass eventually. I know I'll come up with the solution and it will be fine. I know the nanny (when I find one) will work out and the kids will be fine.  I know I will get no credit and it will appear as though a magic elf made all of these things happen. I know that I will be accused of shutting down her idea when in fact there's nothing to shut down...there's no plan to dismiss. I know I will be blamed for railroading. And I know that is upsetting, not only being blamed for finding a solution and being accused of being a steamrolling, control freak, but not getting credit when you continually are the one fixing the problem.

Here's what I will not do, which is different. I will not have a liquid lunch. I will not B&P. I will feel my feelings and breathe and hope they pass so we can have a nice weekend.

I have faith that with or without a child I can live a great sober life. I have even more faith I would not drink if I had a child. I can't explain it- maybe a real mom can- but I just would not. The problem- I had a stupid slip a few weeks back and now he probably will take the idea of kids off the table. I get it, he wants to have 100% trust and wants to have a good relationship together. The other problem- we are at an age where it is kind of now or never (I do not reveal my age and I do want this part to become a debate. Just know that physically I may be at the last year or two of being able to try)

What I am trying to figure out is if I tell him now that I still want to have kids (with the slip fresh in his brain- he will say no even if he would consider it). Or do I wait a little bit of time (maybe couple months) to show him how great I am doing?

The Background-

I had a series of unfortunately/terrible life events that I clearly didn't handle well. I suffered from depression and starting abusing alcohol. It escalated to the point I was drinking daily. My husband was very supportive albeit frustrated. I got some help and it was a bumpy road. It was a problem for about a year, maybe less. Probably took a year to get to a good place. I was doing so well and my husband said if I kept on the path we could consider kids. I was doing amazing and had a stupid slip. One that I can't even explain and I feel terrible/guilty about it. I look back and see what I could have done better but still can't get to bottom of what the hell went through my brain. Anyways. He almost left me right then and there. I made a promise to him that I would accept separation if I slipped again. I have zero problems with this because I trust that I can do this long term

I’d tried moderating myself a few times, but I’d somehow always find a rationalisation for why, on that day, it was okay to drink. It became clear I needed to cut it out completely, I almost managed a week but then lockdown happened and I discovered one hour alcohol delivery.

As I celebrate two weeks sober I am also able to say that this is the first work week ever that I have made it through without a drink since I started working full time almost 20 years ago.

I would be lying saying this hasn’t been one of the harder things I have done in a long time/ever.  After years of using alcohol to numb my emotions, the first 10 days or so I felt like one raw nerve ending.  Every small emotional response, both happy and sad,  like a fire hose flooding through my body that I just wanted to stop.  With the support of my amazing husband and reading other’s stories here I was able to find the strength to keep moving forward.

I will continue to wake up each morning and make the commitment not to drink today.  One day I will be able to honestly/comfortably make a longer commitment to staying sober.  Until that day comes I will work on myself and address the underlying reasons that lead me to drink.  Additionally, I will continue to remind myself that each day I don’t drink is something to be proud of.

I didn't even think too much about alcohol after the first 3 weeks or so. Then when meeting with friends after a long time of social distancing I couldn't say no to a beer. I couldn't explain properly why I stopped drinking and a friend of mine convinced me that it was totally fine for me to drink... ugh. So then - it was a holiday week - I drank like 1 alc beverage a day for 3 days. A week later there was a birthday party and I just couldn't not drink. Social anxiety and feeling discomfort in this pub made me drink (not to the point of black out, it was like 6 or 7 drinks and I went to bed at 1 am). I thought I could easily go back to normal and feeling well after 1 day hangover... 

I felt horroble the next day. Now already a week sober I'm AGAIN experiencing all the difficulties I already had when getting sober for the first time. Like cravings although they are not as bad as back then and dizziness. But the worst symptom for me is this crippling exhaustion. I'm now nearly 1 week sober again and I am so freakin' tired all day. After 7 weeks of not drinking I could easily go to bed at 11 pm and jump out of bed at 8 am. Now I feel so awake till 3 in the morning, have vivid dreams and feel like crap in the morning. So apparently all the progess I made concerning my sleep pattern and energy levels is gone. It's so not worth it! I thought I could drink moderately and go back to normal again after that. But no, I have to learn that my body hates alcohol. I partied hard for years and my body is tired now. Also I'm turning 30 soon lol.

Last Tuesday I had my last drink.  It's been tough, but I've been busying myself with work and video games. My friends had a get together on Sunday I would have loved to go to but I knew it would be too much for me right now so I passed.

Tonight was the hardest though. I work at a restaurant and we call Thursdays the ""millionaire shift"" because we'd still work them even if we were rich. It's a great crew, not too busy or too slow, Goldilocks style. Usually after work we all have a beer and chill for a bit, but not for me tonight. As the shift was ending, I found myself more and more just wanting to have a beer, but when the time came and someone asked if I'd like one, I declined and that was that. It felt nice.

My friends asked a bit about it but I just shrugged and continued on. I don't feel ready to tell everyone my decision yet, I have a bad habit of getting myself all hyped on something then not following through. I just wanna be low-key for a while until I get my feet on solid ground.

The afternoon was slightly out of focus due to lack of sleep but after a bit of banter with my boys and a few belly laughs with the bosslady I was again on the right track.

I can recognise it and I can sit with these doubts until they pass, which they always do.

1396,2020-07-17 01:47:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hsq9sd/gilbasaurus_rex_an_introduction/,Gilbasaurus Rex - An introduction,"So today is what I think is my tenth day sober. Not my longest stretch, I have frequently gone weeks without a drink, the longest probably being a month, but my decision to become sober was more about the way I drink, what I drink, and the poor decisions that come along with it.

So binge drinking in the UK seems to have become the norm. Counting down the days until the weekend before you can go out with your friends and get slaughtered. Whilst that might not be my go to, I've definitely partaken more times than I can remember, and the resulting decisions were probably completely different to 'normal' drinkers.

When I drink, it's frequently alone. And its more often or not a bottle of spirit. A whole bottle. The only occasions where that bottle wasn't finished was when I would pass out on the sofa with the final glass, frequently tipped into my lap. 

I cannot drink in a sensible manner. And I would often talk myself into drinking at each and every minor inconvenience. Or each occasion when I don't have parental responsibilities or work commitments. Or free time with no plans. Sometimes I don't have parental responsibilities on a sunday evening, but I definitely have work commitments on a monday morning. It'll be,  ""ok if I start drinking at 'X' time and stop drinking at 'Y' time, I'll be fine for work with lots of water before bed, right?""

Well the answer was no. If I hadn't finished my alcohol by 'Y', then I would need to finish it because I wouldn't want it there the next day. Queue the next day, after I'd pass out on the sofa and I'd either barely make it to work, feeling terrible, or resort to taking a last minute holiday to 'recover' in peace. This even sometimes led to buying another bottle of alcohol because 'it'll be finished by 'Y' time, and I can rest and recover for the rest of the day/night'.

And the above was one of my weekend cycles for so long when I first started binging alone heavily. I would drink most of the bottle, pass out, have some left for the next day. And you're all really going to love the logic of the next part. I wouldn't want that remaining alcohol in the house, so I would obviously have to drink it, but there wouldn't be enough alcohol to get me drunk, so I would obviously need another bottle to reach that state. And obviously to most, and probably me but I chose to ignore it, that cycle can last for days, until the 'empty bottle and drunk enough' state is reached.

You get used to it. You get used to the alcohol being able to shut off your thought process. You get used to feeling content, that false fog of contentedness that comes from not being able to coherently think about all the things that go on in day to day life. You are only living in the moment with that bottle, and whatever conversations or actions that you have in that moment,  most of which will not be remembered. 

And I didn't realise, but most of my interactions with friends and family that were initiated by me, were when I was drunk, because I was drunk, and because that bottle rips the confidence from your real self and allows it to only exist in your drunken state.  And you wake up the following day having had conversations with people that you cannot remember, making plans you will not follow through, and making promises you will not keep.

And for me, without even realising it, my ability to drink, or drinking alcohol, to some of my peers, that became my 'thing'. 

For me, my admission that I do not have a good relationship with alcohol stemmed from the poor decisions made because of alcohol, and for alcohol. Too many mondays missed. Too many weekends wasted. Too many conversations I cannot remember. Too many times chosen to stay in, alone, rather than going outside, or seeing friends and family. Too many half days wasted because I cannot function and get myself ready until the afternoon. 

It's all too much. And it's a literal poison. Clouding your brain and slowly destroying your body from the inside out.

So I have decided to abstain. At first it was until I could have a 'normal' relationship with alcohol. But I'm not sure that will ever be a thing. And the thing that has filled me with dread the most, is the events/celebrations/social interactions that are all punctuated so profusely with the consumption of alcohol these days. It's the norm. A norm that most people buy into. I cannot remember the last time I celebrated an adult birthday without getting drunk. I go to watch football at least once annually, drunk all day and all night, I have two company christmas celebrations, drunk.

But I can only conquer the dread mentioned above by diving in. And choosing not to drink. Because alcohol shouldn't need be a precursor for all of those things. 

And it won't be.

I know this was a long post, but I hope it finds you all well, and perhaps some of you can take some things from it. Things that may open your eyes to some behaviours that weren't even apparent to you. 

I am so grateful to have found this place, I am amazed by each and every one of you who is taking the steps to break free from the shackles, and this place has evoked emotions, made me more self aware, and definitely helped strengthen my resolve no end.

Let me start by saying I understand why they kept their distance while I was drinking because I wasn’t a fun person to be around and they had to wonder if I would be intoxicated or in a general shitty mood from being hungover, etc. and while I believe some trauma that happened for me involving them contributed to my escalated two year bender which ultimately resulted in me seeking treatment, I don’t blame that on them, as I chose to drink about it.

Up until this spring, we all lived states apart (mom, myself, sister/bil/kids). They were the last to move home. I (re)started my sobriety journey about a month ago when I finally found outpatient treatment that accepted private insurance. My family says they’re proud of me and support me, but are more distant than ever, especially after hearing that I’m in group meetings with hardcore drug addicts and felons (kinda a swept under the rug because I can’t possibly be like *them*). I constantly have to make the 40 min drive to see them to spend time with my niece and nephew, despite my sister and bil constantly coming to my town to hang out with her brother (half sibling situation) so my bil can drink with him (veteran with alcohol issues of his own). 

Last Friday my sister was coming down to see her brother and had the 2 year old with her and I offered to let her drop her off for me to watch, she agreed but insisted I have no alcohol in the house. Understandable and she got to my house before I got back from the store to get pool swimmies for the baby so I know she did a fridge and cabinet check. I had the greatest time with my niece, my sister did a FaceTime checkin (possibly to confirm I was sober) then stayed out for six hours until midnight which was slightly inconvenient since I had no bedtime things for the baby, was tired and was hoping to get some small biz work done.

Then yesterday she surprised me by suggesting coming down with the baby for lunch and a few hours in the afternoon today. I said sure, I’d get my work done early and we could spend some time together, a new restaurant opened that we could get lunch takeout from. I also let her know I had a 6:15 group meeting and have to be alone for it for confidentiality (we can attend over videoconferencing now due to covid). Lunchtime came and went today, then around 1 she called and said she had to have her husband’s car towed to the dealer so she would be down shortly, I said that was fine but reminded her about my meeting. He dropped them off in their other vehicle around 2 and left to go hang out with her brother. She spent no time with me at all, she brought her work laptop and locked herself in the office so I was basically a glorified babysitter. Don’t get me wrong I love getting that time with the baby (nephew is at his mom’s for the summer) but she completely ignored the lunch plans despite neither of us eating and not having the car seat to leave. So she finally emerges from my office around 5:45. I’m really bad at confrontation so I didn’t say anything else about my 6:15 meeting. She didn’t call her husband to come get her until 6:30 and when he did show up, the baby was in a tired meltdown mode and he had an attitude because he had to stay sober enough to come pick them up and/or because the brother had to take an evening exam and couldn’t drink with him (I speculate the reason, but I’ve know him long enough to know his “I need to drink” attitude.) 

All that to say, they went right back over to the brothers down the street to order pizza and I got a picture text of the baby later doing something silly and several empties on the counter in the background.

So I’m feeling frustrated that all this “support” and “giving me a chance to prove myself” is a guise for free babysitter. That’s twice in a week they’ve made the effort to hang out with the brother but I’m just the glorified babysitter. I feel like really supporting me would be spending active time with me and talking to me, not just about how I’m doing in recovery but just as someone you want to spend time with overall. Maybe I am being sensitive but just being a free babysitter doesn’t feel like much support. Plus I missed my meeting. So in order to get my third for the week I have to do the morning and hope I don’t have a work call come in.

All of my past drinking binges and then the good under control times had stability and consistency in common. I am good when I have a stable consistent lifestyle. Whether a meal plan for the week and grocery list, schedules appointments and plans, what day I’ll sit down and fill orders or make products, what day I’ll mow the lawn, work out, etc. which is what I’m trying to do with my three weekly meetings - figure out which three I wish to attend and stick to it. I did feel some disrespect today between family time turning into babysitting (I still had some day job work to do) and the disregarding my meeting after being told twice. I know I need to set some firmer boundaries and be better about speaking up, but I also worry about them getting petty. In the past when I’ve spoken up about hurt feelings or disrespect, my mom and sister gang up on me about being too sensitive (my mom always takes my sister’s side since she’s the baby and the one who gave her grand babies).

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,' Carnevalino kept saying, over and over to his girlfriend, while he was still strapped into his seat belt,"" said Singmaster, 58, who arrived at the scene before the authorities, along with a group of eight other residents. ""But she didn't respond.""

&#x200B;

Singmaster said he arrived just after 1:15 AM to find a nearly hysterical neighbor hovering over Funaro, who was slumped in the passenger seat with her seatbelt still fastened. No airbags were deployed, he said. The neighbor was clutching a cellphone to her ear with her shoulder, he said, trying to help Funaro at the prompting of a 911 operator.

&#x200B;

""The girl was gurgling up blood, breathing heavy, and her stomach was heaving up and down,"" Singmaster said. ""Her boyfriend was surprisingly cool and calm, like he was totally focused on her."" -The Philadelphia Inquirer, Wednesday, August 24th, 1999

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Bernadette would have turned 39 this month, and instead of celebrating with her, I go to the cemetery where she's buried and spend some time with her in the only way I can now. She had just turned 18, was a week away from attending St. Joes University on a full paid scholarship, to study biology, and was going to break up with him as soon as she had moved to campus.... or at least, that was her plan. Her boyfriend, we later found out, had been very drunk at the time of the accident, but the blood draw happened 8 hours after the accident, and he registered a .043 percent. I'll leave you to do the math on how over the limit that 18 year old was, when he slammed his car into the tree that morning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We buried her on a Saturday, and the crowd was so large, that the grave itself was beginning to collapse, as we had just had torrential rains for the proceeding few days. One of the funeral directors said to us that ""There's something wrong with the grave. Please stand back."" To which I exclaimed, ""You're right! You're putting my best friend in it!!""

The next day, I packed up my belongings, while begging my parents to let me take a semester off, to process the loss. They refused, and off I went to University. I knew my life would never be the same. The sound of her boyfriend, laughing in the back of the church with his friends, during the services, will never fade from my memory... 

&#x200B;

I began to drink more and more, as one friend after another died. One to a freak car accident, one to a suicide, one to an overdose... and a fiancé, who I had known since childhood, to a seizure. Finding him dead, in the house 5 doors down the block from where I am now, was beyond brutal.  I went to more funerals during those 7 years, after Bernadette died, than I had in my entire life. I had slowly let the very substance that killed my best friend, consume my life. I was a fairly high functioning drunk, until I wasn't anymore... two decades of drinking is never how I imagined my life, not at all. I should have known better, but even after everything I experienced, I still fell down the rabbits hole.

&#x200B;

Alcohol is quite ""cunning, baffling and powerful"", as the Big Book of AA says. Recovery work is a daily necessity for me, if I want to live a full and happy life. In the end, I want to live a life I can be proud of, and I know I will get there, if I make this pledge, One Day at a Time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Thank you to all the DDs tonight, and to all of us who are choosing NOT to drink. I'm with you.

It feels like I can’t get a handle on myself. My mental health is suffering and I’m having an impossible time finding a doctor who will cooperate with me to find a solution. Every relationship I’ve had has revolved around drinking. I’m still in love with my ex and he won’t leave me alone, I don’t even want him to. 

Everyone around me drinks. People know it’s bad but they don’t know how bad it is. I can go a couple weeks without drinking, then I go right back to it. I feel hopeless and helpless and alone. 

I’ve been to a handful of AA meetings but something never clicked. I was never able to fully immerse myself or even sure how to get a sponsor. 

I can’t afford therapy and I feel like there is so much unresolved trauma in my life that I can’t deal with alone. 

I don’t know what to do. I know what I need to do but I always seem to put myself back into this hell. 

I want to get my life on track. I want to succeed in the career I’ve been studying for. I want a healthy relationship and a family. I want to love myself enough to stop. I want to be happy. 

I’ve read so much on sobriety. So many people who felt as hopeless as me, maybe more. People who pulled it off and are living a happy, sober life. 

Why can’t I figure this out? I feel ok for a while but I always get hooked back in. I feel so alone.

The  first 3-4 months I felt the need to come here and lean on this sub for  support quite frequently, but as time has gone on this hasn't been the  case quite as much. About two weeks ago I passed the 6 month mark, which  at the beginning of this whole journey felt like a distant point on the  horizon. The experience has certainly been a mixed bag of ups and  downs, but in general I would say it's true what you hear from many on  this sub that it gets easier with time. One of the biggest things I've  struggled with has been anxiety and depression, and they're still there,  at times making this whole thing a slog. However, I would say the worst  of the symptoms seemed to pass around 100 days ago, and compared to the  first couple of months I would say life has improved quite a bit. I'm  getting ready to start my first semester back at school since 2010 in  about a month. I pissed away my 20's, and there's no getting that time  back, but I don't think it's a coincidence that inside of a year of  putting down the bottle I'm ready to give it another go at school. My  finances have also improved, and I've saved more in the past 6 months  than I have at any other point in my life.  I'm comfortable saying this  is the longest I've ever gone without alcohol since starting to drink  socially around age 18, so over a decade let's say. I have a long way to  go to get to where I want to be, but I think 2020 probably represents  the most progress I've ever made towards a decent life, as crappy of a  year as this has been in every other measurable way. I'll probably post  again in the next couple days after hitting 200 days AF.

Thanks  again to everyone here for your support. I haven't logged in quite as  much, but I definitely still spend some time on this sub, and the  encouragement you've all given me, as well as the time I've spent  reading your stories, have been extremely valuable in continuing this  journey.

When quarantine started I quickly realized that I was not capable of moderation while home alone all day... at all.  Just for fun, I thought I would list some of the things that I’ve been doing that helped me get this far, in case any newbies are struggling.


1.  I don’t really socialize with people who drink any more. My best friend has several years of sobriety and next closest friends are both the type who will drink a glass of wine like three times a year (lucky!). My only friend who still drinks a lot—I have to love her from afar for now.  But she told me recently that I had inspired her to try to get sober too!


2.  I keep a wide variety of interesting drinks in the fridge to satisfy different types of cravings.  I have seltzer, kombucha, OJ, like a dozen different herbal teas, I make my own cold brew coffee, and I’m obsessed with all these cocoa & mushroom/Adaptogenic drinks that are all the rage now.  I also have a kava bar where I live and pick up kava or kratom when I want something to relax me or pick me up just slightly. Idk about anyone else, but their effects are not even close to that of alcohol, to me.  So I don’t consider it cheating.


3.  I discovered sober/recovery tiktok.  I’ve followed so many cool people there and I love making content and engaging with other creators who are focused on sobriety.  It’s so much fun to see that we are all able to still have such a good time sober! 


4.  Most importantly, I have dedicated so much time and effort to fixing the root causes of my substance abuse.  I have C-PTSD due to childhood trauma.  I’ve read tons of books on recovering from trauma, gone to therapy almost every week, and see a psychiatrist regularly for medication management.  I’ve felt my anxiety getting to an uncomfortable place again lately.  And today I started a PHP (partial hospitalization program) where I go do group & individual therapy as well as psycho-education 6 hours a day Monday through Friday.  (Staying sober has also, for me, meant landing a job with excellent benefits and time off that have allowed me to take the time to devote to this!)  Keeping myself mentally healthy is the key to staying sober for me.  Since I mainly drank to deal with my negative emotions, depression, anxiety, etc.

I still feel that I have a looooong way to go.  But of all the times I’ve tried to get sober, this time truly does feel different.  It feels like the right time, and like I finally have the right toolset, and am READY for it.   Anyone else feel free to add things that have helped you and turn this thread into a discussion to help those new to sobriety or struggling with it!",28,1

I have been intermittently lurking here but I’m now ready to post and hopefully seek help. I’ve never been able to be a one drink type of person. One drink sparks something in my brain and I have to have more. I still wouldn’t consider myself a very heavy drinker but because I fast, 4 drinks will hit me like an absolute tonne of bricks. Recently I had a really, really bad episode after a fast where I ate such a minimal amount but drank around 400ml of whiskey. The next day I was so horrifically dehydrated and couldn’t keep anything down, my body went into shock and it really was one of the scariest moments I’ve had. 

However, I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom a number of times with alcohol and always hope and pray that I can keep consistent but the poison always sneaks back in. I think I’m now at the point where I’ve realised I can’t tackle this on my own and need assistance. I have tried hypnotherapy prior to COVID but those appointments were shut down. How can I tackle this from home?",6,1

I'm not usually one for marking occasions, but I wanted to mark this one with a post. Today, I am 4 years sober! Oh God damn, I never thought I'd be able to make this comment.

Now, I must first say, I owe a portion of my success to this forum, I checked in here when I first started and found support and a shared journey. So, I want to say a massive Ty to each and everyone of you, for without this thread I can't say where I'd be now!

Second, the feeling of being sober is really a nice feeling, I've been slowly enjoying more of the world (figuratively - interacting more in my environment) and enjoying the smaller things in life. I have started studying, or did a couple of years back, and without being too descriptive, I'll be finished part 1 of the long journey at the end of this year.

For those who report weight loss, I didn't find that to be the case, I pretty much stayed or gained the whole time. However, I have started doing mostly keto diet, or at least lowish carbs, and have found some joy. I've lost almost 50lbs on my heaviest, and still have probably 50lbs to go till I'm lean. So, we'll see, it's a journey after all, and  I hope to make it to my weight loss goals - till then though, I'm just playing it one day at a time 😊.

Because I'm sober, I'm better connected to my family and have a want for a deeper connection with those in my life. I have a depth to me now which is good and bad. Good because it's allowed me to build deeper connections with people, but bad, because alot of people don't have that want towards depth - either way, grateful. Oh, that's another thing, I'm trying to be more grateful, I really have a pretty lucky life, and I'm trying to stop to appreciate it more.

A final remark, if you've read this far. I can say my journey has been tough, it's hard to stay not drinking, I was really good at drinking after all. I find each day a challenge still, nowhere near as a bad as when I first started, but it's there and niggling.

To all those that read this far, Ty, you're all part of the reason I'm able to be make this post - Ty from the bottom of my heart, have a beautiful day 😊.

...................................................................................................

In case you'd like a tip or two that helped me read below - otherwise ignore here below. This is what I did, it's not advice to you, it's just something that worked for me, I'm not saying it'll work for you. 

1. I just stopped drinking, one day, and it was my nephews about 4th bday party. I woke up, my parents were down, my mum said to me ""it's ok son, if you need a drink to put up with today or us, that's alright"" at that moment I took my drink walked to the garage and started drinking - it was about 9am - I sat on a workout bench and started drinking it... I didn't get far in, and I just started crying, I couldn't work out why, then it hit me, my mum accepted my destructive lifestyle. It took about 15mins to get myself together. With that, I put my drink down, pulled myself together and went and threw out my drink. From that day on, I never had another one - this might be a share more than a tip, so, sorry about that. I guess I would say, one day for you too, the drink will become too much and you'll have a moment - if it happens, embrace it. You can use it as a stepping stone to a better life.


2.  In the beginning I was on this reddit quite frequently, I used this for support, I didn't post much, I just liked to read and have that shared understanding wtih my fellow soberites. I found this immensely helpful.


3.  I went to one AA meeting, I went for a relative. I didn't find it too helpful to me, others may, and I'm glad I went, I've not beyond going back, one visit isn't enough to know. So, consider visiting if you need a bit of support in your journey.


4.  The journey is good, it's an interesting journey, it pits you against you. If you're looking to stay sober, accept that this is a challenge. It's one that you can definitely do, but it's not meant to be easy - so don't expect easy!


5.  A big one, be aware your social circles will change and evolve. I used to have buddies I partied with, now a lot of those same buddies, I just catch up with and don't drink. I have lost a few that were just drinking buddies, and that's ok too. We are all on different journeys in life, and there's wasn't a long term connection with them and I. That said, I do miss the socialising with booze and people. And it is difficult to go to places whilst sober. I have a thing coming up, a house party, and I'll have to answer the alcohol questions. But, you know what I've found? Most people don't care, they ask, you answer, the world keeps turning. So, for this point id say, it is a challenge to attend places where booze is, especially in the early stages. I still find it hard today. Though, it is possible, and you're doing this for you, not anyone else - stay the course, it's worth it.

6.  You have to relearn a lot of life's experiences and that's ok. Things like going to the shops catching up with friends buying clothes doing grocery shopping all these things so much different doing sober. It's hard to do but I found it worth it. It is as though alcohol was defining the world around me and I didn't even know. When I stopped drinking I slowly started to see the world in a new light by not drinking I really discovered some of the wonderment in the world. So remember it is hard to reintegrate yourself into Society after being a heavy drinker but I found it worth it.

7.  Find something you enjoy doing more or less as early on as you can handle. Whether it's knitting, walking, going to cafes, or taking pictures, it doesn't matter just find something you can do that you enjoy doing. Now, it's up to you what you find and when you find time or inclination to do it. I just found it helpful to try and find something that I enjoyed.

Well this is a pretty long post I think I will leave it at 7 points. Now just remember if you've read this far I'm not saying I'm right, I'm not even saying you have to do any of these things, I'm simply saying, these things helped me and they may help you. Best wishes and if you've read this far thank you, if not, that's ok too 😊. Thank you for the sub and the opportunity to post. All the best ❤️.",75,0

Especially during the life and times of COVID. I have nothing to do and nothing to be sober for. Except for myself of course. But that’s pretty small potatoes in my world, sadly. 

I just wrote out some of my feelings and ended up totalling (roughly) how much I spend per year on booze. It’s like 10k. Add that to the guilt I was already feeling about being a waste of drunken space and, man it sucks. 

I’ve lost so much (and keep losing more) and missed sos much. I’ve ran so far and so fast from my pain that I don’t know if I even know how to stop. The pain keeps building, booze related in some respect usually, and so I turn to the bottle to alleviate it. I used to say I felt like I’m on a rollercoaster of highest highs and lowest lows, and I feel like I’m right back on it again. Except, again, it’s only getting worse. I know this is a progressive disease but, damn. 

Then I ran across this which I posted a YEAR AGO!

“Anyways I guess this is almost 48hours on the books for me. Which is something. I just can't shake the pervasive feeling of guilt and shame and that no manner of ""good"" will make up for all the ""bad"" that my drinking has caused. Like what's the damn point in trying? But this is my life. And dammit I'm tired of wasting it.”

Yep. About sums up my feelings now too. I get the whole you can’t change the past only the here and now. But I’m not fucking changing it, which feeds more into the guilt. I’m no further today than I was a year ago, in fact I think I’ve gone backwards. 

I don’t know how to let go. I don’t know how to forgive. Especially seeing as I haven’t made any forward progress. Cue one of my biggest triggers: that damn guilt and shame.",10,1

Background: We are both sober but after the death of my husbands brother in May we relapsed. It lasted a month and now we are back to the good sober life. However, I'm finding it tough to think of something special that's not drinks related. Fancy restaurant = wine parings, charter a yacht = champagne, party with friends is kind of pointless because of covid restrictions. ( please don't at me that we can do those things without alcohol, I know we can in theory, but we're just not there yet in our journey )  We are definitely fragile in our sobriety so we want to avoid anything triggering.

I was left with sizable inheritance, had no job, and slowly descended into chaos. I had several of what I can only assume were strokes, with one being so bad I dislocated my shoulder. Passing out, getting up and drinking again, no matter the hour, it wasn't good. The past few months I had noticed my clothes getting tighter, and after losing almost 80lbs in a year after high school (235-155), it was a big trigger for me. 

I could drink a dozen beers and feel like I only had 3 or 4, or down bottles of rum, whiskey, you name it. I had a terrible hangover last Sunday, and finally decided to make the effort to cut booze out of my life. I went cold turkey, and have been free ever since July 5th!

I know it is early days, but everything has been lining up for me since I made the choice. 2 days after my last drink, I got a call for a carpentry job I applied to almost a month before. 

I don't think I have ever felt as good as I do right now, I have had lots of little ""tests"" pop up and seem to be getting through them with little effort. Things like getting offered a beer by neighbors, or song lyrics about drinking playing right as I pass a liquor store, really weird stuff sometimes. The only urge I had to buy beer was to dull an upcoming mushroom trip this weekend, but that feeling passed pretty quick. I feel like the positive mindset I have had lately will only enhance the trip further, and maybe I need a revelatory experience after years of dulling my senses.

I still smoke cigarettes and cannabis, the latter of which has been cut back significantly to a couple times a month. But once I feel comfortable with my sobriety from alcohol, hopefully I can tackle nicotine as well. I am 31 now, my father passed away at 59 from complications that were exacerbated by alcohol, and after seeing that firsthand, I don't ever want to put anyone that cares about me through that.

The anniversary of my father's passing is tomorrow, and I plan on going to his grave for a bit, then having a decent mushroom trip with a close friend of mine. I only do psychedelics about once a year or less, so I try to treat it with the highest respect I can.

To anyone reading this that is considering quitting, I can't recommend it enough, your future self will thank you:)

The exeriment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's chapter was about self talk. Over the last eight days, I had been doing well with positive self talk and drowning out that little voice in my head that would day, ""just one isnt going to hurt"". 

I didnt feel grumpy or annoyed by anything. I was keeping busy. I mowed the lawn and went for a morning walk and during those times, I was listening to The Joys  of Being Sober. I think the voice is popping up because my family is going on vacation starting Saturday. Alcohol is coming out of cupboards and from downstairs. That nagging voice keeps saying, ""its vacation. You're suppose to relax."" ""Everyone else will be doing it, you're going to miss out."" 

I keep telling it I wont miss out. I will enjoy vacation in a different way. Getting up early. Going on runs. Walking on the beach with my dog. Not having a hangover. Remembering it, all of it. 

If I drink nothing good will come of it. Even if I don't say anything hurtful, I could send out drunk texts to catch up with people. I'll be hungover. My motivation will disappear. I will no longer care about walks or jogging and that doesn't just last for that day. It extends for days. Most importantly, I dont want to go back to the self hatred and being ashamed. 

When people ask, I'll say, ""no thank you. I'm doing a 30 day alcohol free challenge to see how I feel at the end of it."" If I need to, I can always break away from the group as well. I will have my own motel room for the majority of my stay.

Now I live in a very drink heavy city and everything is a happy hour, bottomless brunch, or going to a bar after social sports. 
 
Ive gotten to the point where I seemed to lose my inner conscious when drinking. It was like my inner sober voice that said ""you're good  man you had enough. Just enough it now""  To now me drinking too fast and saying ""eh one more and i'm done."" Only to wake up and for my body realize I really didn't need that one more before bed. 

I've noticed its not been kind to my digestion and overall health but this pandemic is actually making it easier. About 3 weeks ago I recently I decided to cut out drinking on weekdays (I recently cheated yesterday do with a summer shandy for dinner though >.<).  I noticed an overall increase in my sleep, energy, digestion, etc. Drinking has also made it extremely hard to lose weight which I am trying to tackle as well.

I almost completed but kept picking up again. Then I went to their more intensive program and still kept drinking, even with antabuse (once I tested it and discovered all I got was a flush, all bets were off). Next, I was off to an inpatient center and went straight back into IOP after that and lasted all of 3 weeks before dropping out. I just really wanted to drink. 

So now, the 4th round of IOP and I finally get to graduate tonight. I keep downplaying this accomplishment to myself and others. It's just a piece of paper saying I showed up. I know it's just the beginning, but already I feel the benefits. My relationships are stronger, I'm a heck of a lot less anxious, I am learning to sit with myself. I have to remind myself that this is a big deal. Yeah it's a piece of paper, but it's a piece of paper I worked for.  

I just wanted to let this out. I am so proud of myself.

I have a strong suspicion that many of you who want to lay off drinking are scared to drink less because you think you'll find out you're an alcoholic, when it's really just a habit you can change or break!

\----------------------------------------------

I'm finally going to relate my experience! I am just amazed that my relationship with alcohol is changing so drastically, and a big part is this SR. It has really helped... especially seeing it randomly pop up as I scroll my home page of subreddits.

I started my career in food/bev when I was 19. I ran a nightclub/bar in LA when I was 24. I've drunk nearly every night for 20 years (my 44th next Wednesday), then lockdown came. I'd always wanted to drink less (aka struggled with it constantly), and admittedly, I rarely had hangovers vs just not feeling at 100%. I was like a ""2 big martini"" guy, so never out of control... but the habituation is insane.  It's just a pattern of behavior, and it never impacted my professional or domestic life, it's more about health and fitness (I am active and healthy outside of drinking).

So covid-19 starts and i end up drinking too regularly. My job slowed down, so like so many have joked ""5p got earlier and earlier"" and I just wasn't taking care of myself. I noticed it impacted sleep. It impacted my diet (not eating enough, eating comfort food). I wasn't hungover, but I didn't feel top notch each day, etc. For me, I finally realized it tied into my mental state, and blood pressure, and sweating which I hate more than anything. But during early lockdown of April and May, I was going on multiple day benders, ""bloody mary? mimosa? midday nap, start again til wee early hour of the morn bedtime)

Now, I've gone from 7 days a week to maybe 2 or 3 days a week in the last 2 months. I love the feeling of a good night's sleep. I love the feeling of not waiting to drink. It's unreal. I really love the nights where I have a glass of wine, and don't need to drink more after that. It's a new thing for me. That NEVER happened... not because of addiction, but because \*I THOUGHT\* I wouldn't be able to stop, so I never tried.

And I've really got to congratulate this sub. I think my tl;dr is that the habituation of drinking is likely more powerful than the notion of actual alcoholism, and our country can NOT have a conversation about the notion you can slow down or quit on your own. I have a strong suspicion that many of you who want to lay off drinking are scared to drink less because you think you'll find out you're an alcoholic, when it's really just habit. Give a shot. You've nothing to lose.

You can get healthy on your own without AA, etc. This is a massively powerful support group. And I, along with most of you, really cherish it. It's changing lives. Keep it up. And don't fault yourself for one off day, or going backwards. We've plenty of time to help each other and move forward, get healthy, feel great, and take control.",5,3

A few years ago I went 100 days sober and never felt so good physically and mentally. I slipped and went back into old bad habits. So recently I thought I should try and do something about it, so I spoke to my Dr. I was prescribed Prozac. I’ve been taking it for about 6 weeks and feel better, however I always drank, 4 - 6 cans 3 - 4 nights a week. It was my way of feeing, well you know, you’ve all had that feeling. But now. On the medication, if I have just one drink I feel so down it’s unbearable. It never used to make me feel this way. Awful, but I still want to drink. Even though it makes me feel 100 time lower on the meds. Anyone experienced the same? I guess I need to just accept I can’t drink on this medication, or in reality at all. But that makes me feel even lower. I’m sorry for rambling. Anyone any experience with this?",6,0

Kids have been absolutely awful, then the lawnmower died, and the wife went to the shop and called me asking if I wanted to just fuck it all, get take out and beer and chill out. 'You could use it' she said. 

I said no, reminded her and myself why I don't drink anymore and thought nothing else of it. But when she came back she had a four pack of Budweiser, and I have to admit I used to enjoy that. So, one was opened. 

I took a mouthful. 

And then promptly sprayed that disgusting stuff all over the garden fence. How the HELL did i pour that shit down my throat every night for years?!?

Plus, it was alcohol free, so even more guilt free! It just reinforces the idea that 1: beer tastes absolutely awful, 2: any and all temptation is now gone. One of the things stopping me drinking was the taste, and now I've tried the alcohol free stuff, I don't even want to pretend to drink. 

So I don't have to reset my counter, I haven't an inkling of an urge, not even a ghost of a ghost and best thing yet, a new PS4 game comes out tomorrow and I can drive to the shop and buy it without worrying about being pulled over, feeling like shit because of a hangover and actually have a good day enjoying myself instead of feeling anxious and guilty!

This morning I keep thinking about all the things I will have to ""miss out"" on. I am thinking about how much of our culture is surrounded by drinking. My ten year anniversary with my boyfriend is coming up- no glass of champagne for me. No glass of champagne on new years. No glass of champagne at my wedding. Today I am working on reframing those thoughts. No potential fight with my boyfriend on our anniversary. No blackout on new years. No hangover after my wedding. But its still hard to accept that I don't get to celebrate in our cultures traditional sense. It makes me feel left out, like I can't be a part of our society. And that's a lot to deal with. I am excited to see my number of sober days grow... but I am so nervous for what is to come. I am nervous about the conversations that may arise with my friends, family, and coworkers, many of whom may not understand that I have a problem, and many who may judge me. Yesterday I had to turn down an offer from a coworker i am becoming closer with, who wanted to have a wine night to decompress from a difficult case we are working on together. I didnt say that I have a problem when I drink, I told her that I am trying to lose weight for a wedding that I am in. I suggested switching the wine night to a popcorn and movie night, and my coworker dropped the conversation entirely. The thing is, due to the nature of our work (I am a social worker in behavioral health), I feel that I can't be open about my problem due to the preconceived ideas it may cause regarding my competence. And I feel like i lost out on making a new friend because I had to turn down the experience. And with where I am in life, opportunities for new friends don't come around often. 

Idk. Just my thoughts as I navigate through day two. To anyone reading this, thank you for reading and letting me express my thoughts. 🙏🙌💕",3,0

I'm going through a high stress period in my life and alcohol was my crutch.  Tired? Drink. Stressed? Drink. I realized I had a problem one weekend when I was drinking an hour after waking up. Not that it wasn't a problem with getting hammered in the evening as an escape.

However, after work yesterday, I went into the store to buy a pack of Zyn nicotine packs. The people in front of me we're buying alcohol that I generally used to like and I realized something: the thought of being drunk was disgusting to me. I'm enjoying my evenings more without blacking out, eating things I don't remember eating, and just wasting my time. A 'wasted' evening playing video games on the couch is so much more relaxing than drinking myself into a forced stupor. To add to that feeling, I've saved enough money in the past months to put down a substantial down payment on a WRX.

It's hard to conceptualize a whole life without alcohol, but as long as I keep thinking of each good evening, I think the switch has been flipped. Fuck alcohol. #IWNDWYT",31,0

I have been doing so well since my dry January challenge this year. Yesterday, I fell in old routines and self-doubt. I had a job interview a couple of days ago and it went well, and I am so nervous to hear back. This is a high anxiety trigger and super stressful. I think it is all the hopes that are associated with this new job that I so badly want. And thus, I do want to avoid hearing a ""no"". I have issues concentrating. Yesterday was also rainy day and I thought I could distract myself with lawn mowing. Instead, I fell into the old and bad habits. I have been eating well with intermittent fasting and some 15 lb down since March. And then. Boom. I kept eating all day, snacking, big meals, and in evening, I drank half-bottle of wine. I drank for alcohol sake. Afterwards, I was drunk as I wanted to numb myself. (well didn't work that well). I feel hang-over this morning, but I am surprisingly in a proactive mood. Still anxious to hear about the job. But, I am realizing again, how bad alcohol is. It is not worth it and it didn't help me one bit.

When I'm drinking...... I get super emotional. Not just sadness, but anger.

When I'm sober. I still get sad and angry. During this time though it's not as hyped. I just try to relax.

When I'm sober I actually TALK about my feelings.  I feel my feelings. I try to understand why I am feeling the way I feel.

I have been talking to my friends more. Everyday. When I'm drinking I isolate myself. I've been trying to nurture my relationships.

I am happier and less anxious. 

I am more willing to do more and try new things

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

My 2020 bingo card has checked every box of suck outside of being killed by the police. 
I have Covid symptoms and cant afford the test.
My business is shuttered
So underwater on every bill at this point that bankruptcy would just get me back on a treadmill.
My unemployment has been ""awaiting approval"" for 6 weeks.  At this point I might have called them around 5 thousand times, never even got a chance to be on hold just a robot message saying we cant take your call right now.
Ageing frail parents I cant afford to move back across country to home to care for.  And cant even swallow my pride to move back in with them since they live in a retierment community so I would be kicked out because they have tenant age requirments.

I could go on with a scroll of other problems.  My point being I am fresh to sobriety, I DO WANT TO STAY SOBER.  But I keep having this nagging thought inside I am having trouble arguing down anymore.

That thought is ""you always drank to not be shy or you drank because of a problem that happened sober, your life is a five car pile up sober its a trainwreck drinking but at this point who cares, a wreck is a wreck now go buy a 12er""

The last 4 Zoom AA meetings I attended I left early.  I have always felt cursed in life, I listen to people share their stories most of which made my war stories look mild.  They always end the share with how happy they are now, how their families love them more their partner is happier their job is great.  Im sober now and was a more concious problem drinker than them and have none of those things.  An Ex wife who left me 2 months into marriage because she did not want to ""be tied down"" the two industries I have backgrounds in collapsed and the sponsor I tried to get from AA not emailing me back.

I feel cursed, please im sure there are others who have been in similar boats if not even much much worse boats I need to hear from you, I need hope again...I know if I drink I will self-destruct but im starting to not care.

Two years of absolute clarity of thought, wonderful sleep and full awareness of everything going on in my life.  This is the longest I have gone without a drink since I was 15 (now pushing 50).

I wanted ""celebrate"" today by dropping a brief note of encouragement to others in this group who are struggling in the early days of sobriety, or who have not yet made the great leap.

While I could go on and on about all the fantastic rewards that await you (the weight loss, the money saved, the improved relationships, health, etc.) I will instead point out what for me has become by far the greatest benefit of not drinking:  the incredible (and unexpected) increase in free/productive ***TIME*** that becomes available when sober.  This is something that I had not considered when I quit drinking, but that has become the most welcome surprise of all (and there have been a LOT of great surprises).  I had never attempted to quantify how much time I spent (or wasted rather) thinking about things that I did because of my alcohol consumption, but now that I no longer do such things it has become very clear that I wasted at least half of my ""sober time"" thinking (and stressing) about things that were related to being drunk.  So, if you add up being drunk half the day, and wasting another quarter of it thinking about shit that was directly related to the drinking, it doesn't leave a lot of time to actually live.

The mental energy and time I spent worrying about health, finances, relationships, work - that is all time I now have for doing things that are productive and enjoyable.  I basically gave myself an entire extra day for every 24 hours by simply quitting the booze.  There is no more pressure to get anything done because I have all my waking hours to take care of business.  It is, in one word, amazing.  I challenge any drinker contemplating sobriety to add up how much time in a given day you spend doing something (including thinking) unproductive that is related to your alcohol consumption.  You will be dismayed at how much life you are losing due to alcohol while not actually drunk.

Anyhow, just in case anybody out there is looking for yet another motive to stop drinking, I thought I would throw that out there as another choice benefit.

Peace to all, and good luck for those who are working through it.  Keep at it, is worth it!  It will be the best decision you ever made.",10,0

Sunday I found out that a friend I met in treatment died from liver failure. She was the sweetest person and I never expected that she wouldn’t be successful in her sobriety. I’m devastated for her family and friends. She was so cheerful and full of energy. She barely even seemed to have a problem. I think it’s making me nervous about my own health after drinking also. I’m only 5 years younger than she was. I know I should make a doctor appt to get checked out since I haven’t done that yet but now I’m terrified. And the guilt. I never would have imagined she was in danger of getting liver failure. Why wasn’t it me? Why didn’t I check in with her more often. Why didn’t I ask her more questions about how she was doing or insist on taking her to a meeting? Logically I know I couldn’t have saved her. But it still hurts, and I guess I’m having trouble processing all this at once. I can’t stop thinking about her and how much her family is hurting. I’m not sleeping well, waking up almost every hour from bad dreams. I know it will take time. I have lost friends before but I suppose I drank then. Has anyone been through this?

Since covid, we haven’t seen as much of each other as we have so we all caught up. They live in a city very close to manhattan so when the lockdown happened, they actually moved in with my husband’s dad and his wife to get out of the city.   

And apparently it’s been a low key nightmare. My step mother in law has never been easy to get along with. I’ve always described her as a kind and generous woman with regrettable conversation habits. She’s loud, she’ll talk over you, and she can be combative. Especially when she drinks.   

And she’s been drinking a lot since lockdown. She was already a bottle of wine 3 or 4 nights a week and it’s increased to every night with more on the weekends. With how much more she’s drinking, how aggressive she is also went up. She gets offended at the drop of a hat, yells for minor misunderstandings, launches big debates she doesn’t really understand and refuses to really see reason or logic. She falls asleep mid rant at the table. Their dad is miserable and is trying to talk to her about her booze intake but she’s not really receptive. It’s like she picks some fight at night then the following morning she’ll be fake nice as if she was lectured and talked to about it by her husband and then by nightfall she’s back to drinking too much and picking fights.   

I sat there sipping a Heineken 0 with my pizza just ... really thankful I’m sober. Not “that I’m not drinking”, but that I’m *sober*. Jesus I don’t ever want my husband or my brother and sister in law talking about me like how we were talking about her.   

I didn’t drink today, and I’m not drinking tomorrow. This is like an anti-craving, I don’t think I’ve wanted booze less since my day 1.

Alcohol always came with me to places, fun places too. On holidays, birthdays, Christmas'. He made me feel confident, sexy and smart. He was always there for me and we had fun together. 
Sometimes alcohol was a bad influence on me though, to the point where I said and did things I shouldn't of. and highly regretted. 
One day I realised this friend was really bad for me and I tried to see him less often and in smaller doses. There were some more good times, but the dangerous stuff didn't stop, it escalated. The shame and embarrassment I caused myself when I was with him was almost too much to take at times. My friends noticed, and now and again would gently say; that friend is no good for you.
He gave me anxiety but then he cured it. He gave me depression and brain fog, and made it hard to work, so I would worker harder for longer hours. I was overworked and tired and he relieved that stress at the end of the day, I thought he was my friend. He started making it less fun to hang out with my family and kids because he wanted me to hang out with him. I thought other people liked him being around too, but they really didn't, and sometimes I wasn't myself around him and would forget things that I would say or do. That was scary.
I realised that my friend was very unhealthy for me, for my brain, my health, my relationships and my whole life. He could give me cancer. He could take away time with my kids. He could make me ruin my life and my relationships, my reputation if he hadn't already. I realised this friend was very bad and I needed to walk. He continued to lure me back promising good times and stress relief.
I tried to say goodbye a thousand times and now I feel that I've said the final goodbye. I know now, the good times will always be tainted by the hurt he has caused and I needed to close the door for good. Whenever I let him back into my life he has caused regret and will continue to cause regret. I'm glad that he is gone now. I'm moving on with life. This is the choice I needed to make for life and for my future.

He wanted to do some shopping and I wasn’t in a rush to get back home so I could drink. I bought a nice pair of jeans because I’m finally back to a single digit size instead of wine bloated.  He found a gaming monitor he really wanted.  He was talking about saving his money for it, and after thinking about it for two seconds I said “Get it.”  The $5000 I’ve saved from not drinking made that an easy splurge.

Hey everyone, I’m a 21 year old guy and today I’m celebrating my longest time sober, four months. I stopped drinking in March and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in April after talking to a psychiatrist for the first time, even though I have had symptoms for 5+ years. I had constant suicidal thoughts for years, hated and doubted myself, became so emotionally closed off, and never dealt with any problems, just shoved them aside. Drinking was the most socially acceptable coping mechanism I had for these. I’m in university so drinking a lot is normal, it took me a while to realize I had an issue, but then I looked at the reasons I was drinking and how little control I had after the first sip. My other unhealthy coping mechanisms are cutting and restrictive eating, both of which I had to hide unlike drinking. I’ve unfortunately relapsed on both since stopping drinking, but have since stopped cutting again and I have slowly been trying to eat more normally. Drinking got rid of so many of my worries and made me feel good at the time, but was only a temporary solution that made me feel so much worse mentally and physically the next day, in its absence I turned on my other coping strategies but they were mentally and physically destructive in their own ways. 

Since being diagnosed by my psychiatrist, I’ve found antidepressants/anxiety drugs that work for me and I’ve started therapy. I’m actually dealing with my issues and finding constructive ways to deal with them. I’ve started hobbies I haven’t done in years and am spending more time with the ones I put aside for drinking. I’m sleeping better, exercising, reading, writing, baking, gardening, meditating, playing guitar, listening to more music and overall spending my time better. It’s been weird telling people I don’t drink since 21 is the age most people are drinking a lot, but I’m so much happier without it.

Alcohol gave my problems a short term fix, but overall made them so much worse. I hated myself more than before and my anxiety was through the roof. I was destroying my body. I felt so much worse. It was for all the wrong reasons and in the end it left me feeling so much more shameful. 

Actually dealing with my problems has been really tough, I still struggle with this stuff every single day. I’ve been trying to learn better ways to deal with these things even though it’s often hard and exhausting. Sorry for the long post and IWNDWYT",13,0

The experiment last 30 days and at the end you evaluate how you feel. I've been on and off the wagon more times than I care to count in this last year and a half. This time around, I've equipped myself with tools to help aid my desire to retire from drinking. Part of it is daily journaling to help me reflect. 


Today's chapter was about how alcohol affects the sense and the focus of the day was to focus on each sense individually. 

Sight. On my walks, I've been focusing on the nature around me. Currently, monarch catipillars are in various stages of life form; from newly hatched to a husk of a chrysalis remaing on the milkweed. 

Smell. My sense of smell is coming back. For the longest time I blamed it on the nose spray I used as a child. While that could have deadened some of my sense of smell, I've noticed it start to come back. I can smell the milkweed, the horses, and the oncoming rain. I also caught a whiff of something that died, but I passed quickly.

Taste. I've noticed food is getting its flavor back. I no longer have to coat everything in a thick layer of salt and butter. A small layer of both does just fine. Instead of focusing on whether or not I'll be drinking later and how much to have; I've been filling my time making garlic aioli or basil pesto for dinner. I've also been pausing to pick the fresh raspberries on the side of the road. That taste reminds me of my childhood where I would spend hours outside picking enough so my mom could make jam.

Sound. I don't need to be constantly listening to something anymore to drown out my inner thoughts. I'm okay with walking without music. I focus on the sounds of nature. It has been awhile since I've been on a walk and heard thunder in the distance. I've also started listening to the audio book: The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober. That was a nice way to drown out the sound of the lawn mower.

Feel. I've always been big on being barefoot outside when I'm around the yard and that is something I'm getting back into. Bigger that that though, I've been listening to what my body is telling me. Thirsty? I'll drink water. Hungry? I'll eat til I'm full and stop when I'm not. I'm also consuming more healthy options from my garden. 


All in all today has been good. I've been productive and motivated. The negative feelings I had for myself have mostly disappeared. Another big thing for me was that voice in my head didn't try very hard to talk me into a beer after I got done mowing the yard. I stopped it pretty quickly and instead had a pop tart and some chocolate chips. 

I've been enjoying this new routine.

all this to say that this is not how i expected to spend my 201st day alcohol free but cross addiction is a real thing. i’m just so grateful to this sub and i’m grateful to be safe and healthy even though i’m the kind of idiot who will abuse anything i can get my hands on. 

it reminds me of a joke i heard from someone in recovery that goes like “i heard there’s a pill that cures addiction.... i wonder what five will do?”

I'm a daughter of an alcoholic. I had to do CPR on them a month back when they overdosed. Then a few weeks after, they started continuously vomitting and had to call 911 again.

Then, they stopped. Because my wedding had to be cancelled since my in-laws found out he was an alcoholic and couldn't come see them without being sober. My whole life was around cleaning up their vomit, them sleeping in their urine, and even just plain ignoring them to see if that would get them to change. Ruining my future was the last straw.

After getting out, they were sober. But they said no to rehab or councelling. They excercised, ate well, and I made sure to spend time with them, cook with them, go shopping.. and make sure they had support.

Then this morning I got a call that a spot in rehab opened up. They agreed to go 2 weeks ago, and today I get a ""no"". I promised to pay for it, and I said I'll even come with them and make sure everything's fine.

Then after that conversation, they go out and get plastered. After 1.5 weeks of sobriety because we wanted to get them help. 

And what do I get in my face while I'm emotional and telling them this? ""This is fun to see you like this"". 

I'm not saying this for sympathy. I'm saying this because if you have children, who have stuck by you this whole time.. please get help. It's for you, not for us. I survived by becoming a workaholic (just like them lol). But please don't make ur kids go through what I have.

It hurts me to know that after everything I tried to do, someone finds enjoyment in my misery. Although I know they didn't mean that.. just know that if you're trying to quit, there is NO shame in rehab, councelling or therapy. 

I know it must be so hard to survive this addiction. All the emotions, everything you've kept inside and are trying to heal. But please, I promise there is a guaranteed better life for you by getting help and keeping a positive mindset.

My alcoholic is also a heart patient, a chain smoker, and honestly -- every day for the last 5 years I worry about their last day. I hope this post encourages at least one person to go get help. 

There is so much more to life. And your kids would want nothing more than for you to be part of theirs and to create awesome memories with them.",35,0

I'm in my early 40s now so believe me when I say that this really is just my personality, and not because I haven't found the ""right"" person. I've been in three longterm relationships since I was 20. My current partner is wonderful. He's low-key, 100% accepting, deeply loving, my cheerleader, and truly wants me to be my best self. If I weren't with him I'd genuinely not want to be with anyone else. 

However, since I quit drinking I find myself increasingly annoyed and uninspired by his presence. I feel a deep need to be alone. Nothing seems to compare with the joy, satisfaction, and inspiration of being alone. It feels like pretty much all of my needs are met by my own mind. Nothing ""out there"" seems as interesting or real as what's inside my head. I've always been like this, and I'm wondering if I used drinking all those years to enable me to be in relationships. I wonder if I'll want to break up now that I'm not drinking, so I can be truly, gloriously alone. Or if this is all some kind of reaction to quitting drinking that will pass.

Long story short, I couldn't have gotten here without this sub and everyone in it. 

I listed some benefits that are top of mind:

* **Improved sleep**
* **Weight loss**
* **More energy**
* **Reduced social anxiety**
* **Better memory/improved mental clarity**
* **More in touch with who I am**
* **Better skin**
* **More engaged with those around me**
* **Healthier diet**
* **No hangovers**  


We should all be proud. Not drinking is hard, not living up to society’s standards through consumption of alcohol is hard, not being the same person you once were, and choosing to live a life that is outside of our social norms, is hard. The whole thing is hard, but for me, it has been worth it and I want to thank every single one of you for the help and support.

It's weird, because I'm not someone that another person would look at and think, ""oh they have a problem with drinking,"" but I drink more nights of the week than not, and the last time I went more than a week without drinking was an aborted attempt at dry January in 2019, and when I had mono in 2018. I have a really strong family history of bad, but functional, alcoholism. Even though it seems like I have it under control from the outside, there have been times where it's felt like my thoughts are dominated by drinking - ""I hope someone else orders a beer so I feel comfortable ordering a beer,"" ""I really hope my boyfriend drives so I can drink as much as I want,"" ""I already had 2 beers but we're leaving the brewery, what do I have at home that I can use to mix with that old bottle of liquor I have tucked into the back of the cabinet,"" ""oh I had a stressful day at work, that means I can 'justify' my drinking."" 

I found that a lot of my excitement for events and outings was really just an excitement to drink at said outings. This shit scares me, even though it's relatively mild, because I can see how one gets from this place to where my dad is - drinking a ton of beers every night the moment he gets home from work.

Seeing as my most triggering situations are off the table due to covid (i.e. going to parties, breweries with friends, etc.), and it's harder to justify sitting at home on the couch getting drunk, I felt like this was a good time to stop.

I haven't decided whether this is going to be a lifelong decision yet (I think that would put more pressure on it for me and make it more difficult), just taking it a day at a time. I already feel more ""even,"" if that makes sense. I'm excited to get back in touch with who I am when I'm not drinking.",4,2

I was at my absolute worst, drinking two bottles of wine a night, parents obviously worried about me, bloated face, no energy, constantly anxious. Worried about what happened to me during black outs, to the point where I would just prefer to stay at home and drink alone. 

I put myself in so many dangerous situations (never driving), I must have a guardian angel somewhere because thankfully nothing permanent ever happened. However, those embarrassing and difficult times also help to keep me in check and remind me to never pick up the bottle again. Easier to keep the lion in a cage than on a leash. I know moderation doesn’t work for me. 

In the last six months, I truly feel like I started on a new path. Being around alcohol wasn’t too difficult once I made the choice to give it up. It took some getting used to, but I can now go to dinner parties and just hang out with people who are important to me. I also know to be forever cautious and not let my guard down. Confinement in a weird way was a blessing. Gave me the time to focus on myself, to feel my emotions instead of drowning them. I lost two important people to covid 19 and yes it was incredibly hard but I lived through those emotions, and I was able to be present for those who needed me, instead of a drunk mess. 

I lost 22 pounds (back to my goal weight of 123), met an incredible girl who barely drinks and who is very supportive. She reminds me of how much I can laugh, of how truly beautiful a relationship can be when both people care and have love for each other. The first time I met her was at a party and we talked until 5 am, both completely sober. 

I’m now preparing for the bar exam. It’s my first time trying, and in the past I was always so anxious about finally reaching this moment in my life, but I feel oddly calm about it now. My general feeling of anxiety has subsided and I think that’s probably the best thing about sobriety.

Last night was day 31, I was in a shit mood but I thought my way through it and tried to take care of myself. I didn’t drink, which was good. Tonight, I was in a slightly less shit mood and I caved. I had a few glasses of wine- and all the while I was thinking *is this it?? Drinking is way more boring than I remember…*

Not worth it. Nothing remarkable. Maybe I just still have a high tolerance; wine wasn’t really my drink of choice (whiskey on an empty stomach was more my thing). The taste was quite nice, but stronger than I remembered. It just made me feel slightly ill and stupid. I’ve also somehow gotten so used to not drinking that I had this sense I was engaging in some uncomfortable and foreign practice. I think I'm going back to being a non-drinker, as honestly it’s far more interesting. Yes, the slight increase in verbosity that drunkenness endows is marginally helpful if not always enjoyable (I’m a writer), but I’d like to think I can learn to run at the mouth sober as well. 

In my first week of quitting drinking I made myself a ‘sobriety’ playlist, just things that made me happy, or feel something that related to my situation. I didn’t let myself listen to those songs while drinking- they’re so hopeful and enjoyable I didn’t want to tarnish them. I listened to my ‘drunk’ playlist instead (yes, this was a thing I actually made). Not drinking is so much better you guys- even if it's sometimes hard. Yet somehow I spent all that time hurting myself. It makes sense, but it's still weird.

I've been reading this group for a few weeks now (since my last shame hole, when I found it!) and first wanted to say how tangible and genuine the support is. I know I'm in I the right place.

I can't moderate. My partner and I (he's doing this with me) open wine, then don't stop. We have fun, we laugh - but I don't need to outline the things booze takes from me the next day. We enable each other so much (both ENFP if that means anything)  because when it's us having fun, theres nothing better. But I know we can do it without. 

The reason I'm here now? 

- when I drink, I drink until I pass out. I mean, I go to bed, but I don't quit. We go back to the shop, we get more wine. 
- I don't remember the last hours of most nights. I'm at home (lockdown) and with old, trusted friends, thank god. But really, that scares me. 
- my mental health is shonky and I can see the damage booze is doing. 
- I am exercising but not losing weight. 

The thing is, I need to unpick the belief that drinking makes me fun. I'm scared  that if you take away drinking, there'll be nothing left. But, on the other hand, I don't want to be 'the party girl' for ever.

I want to be able to drink one glass of wine with dinner at my wedding, but I'm scared I'll never be able to do that. So for now abstinence is the goal

I'm on day 2. Im getting married in October. My friends are fabulous. I want to do 90 days sober and see from there about that drink at the wedding. I don't know where I'll be in 90 days, for sure, but IWNDWYT

I still think about drinking. But now when I envision taking a sip I feel anxious about all of the shitty things that would follow it.

Also, the shame. That dirty, God -awful shame.

I thought to myself, those were one of my favorite drinks. I didn’t see what he was making it with, but I imagined some type of aged whiskey in a fancy bottle.

The thought passed and I enjoyed a delicious dinner sitting on the porch with my partner, soaking in the summer evening without alcohol. When I went inside to grab some water, I noticed the bottle of whiskey on the counter.

It wasn’t the bottle of whiskey that I imagined. It was some cheap brand that gave me the chills when I looked at it, like all the sudden I could viscerally feel that feeling when you take one too many shots of cheap booze and you shiver a little but ignore it.

The whiskey reminded me that alcohol tries to seduce you with the fantasy. With the elegant drinks, with the fun times, with the tasty courage. But the story that lies behind the fantasy is the 6$ bottle of whiskey. It’s the reality of wasted money, throwing up on your floor, making a fool of yourself in front of your colleagues, putting yourself in dangerous situations, and lowering your energy. It’s the bad taste in your mouth that convinces you that’s what you deserve.

Im so thankful that in sobriety I have the power to reflect on those fantasy’s, both how I construct them and how society projects them. This helps me to stay sober today, and to feel gratitude for the 1 year and 3 months that have carried me to this point. 

Much love to everyone out there reading this, may you find peace 💕

1606,2020-07-14 21:43:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hren80/7_days_booze_free/,7 days booze free,"Hi!

I started drinking when I was 19 and in college. What started as binge drinking on the weekends eventually evolved to me binge drinking every night. For almost a decade I have struggled with drinking 4-10+ drinks a few nights a week and staying up way too late.  This would lead to me feeling like shit (or going to work still drunk) more often than I can count. I work in an industry where that is definitely not okay because I can cause serious harm to people. It's also given me very high blood pressure, sapped me of my energy and ambition, fucks with my skin, prevented me from forming meaningful relationships, and I weigh more than I ever have.

Four years ago, I quit my job for a new one in the same industry but a different role, moved to a new city, and got a place with my long term partner.  That position was STRESSFUL and my drinking exploded.  I was now drinking at least 6 drinks a night, every night.  A year ago I quit that soul sucking job for a new one.  Again, same industry, but much different role.  My stress went down but my alcohol intake kept going up.  I was now taking swigs from our wine or liquor bottles when she wasn't in the room. Every morning was a struggle to get up and every day was a struggle to accomplish anything.

Despite all the evidence to the contrary, I didn't think I had an alcohol dependency.  I graduated college!  I own a home! I make a comfortable amount of money!  I've run marathons!

I tried all the common strategies to cut back, but I couldn't. I even went to AA for 5 years.  It was court ordered due to a deferred DUI prosecution but I did get a sponsor and I worked the steps with him.  I had two years of sobriety but once the piss tests ceased, so did my sobriety. I was either hungover or still drunk at the meetings for the remaining 3 years.

My partner has been struggling with isolation from the pandemic.  We have been in the same house together for four months and it has brought to light how our relationship maybe isn't great. She's been neglecting some of my needs, and I've certainly been neglecting some of hers. She decided to go to her mom's house for a while. Having the house all to myself meant I get to drink without hiding it. So, a week ago I went to the store to buy a bottle of champagne for myself. I was worried that it wouldn't be enough to last until bedtime so I made myself a cocktail before I started the champagne. I was feeling pretty dope when the bottle was empty so I decided to polish off the rest of the bourbon I had from before. Then I started on the gin.

I blacked out so I'm not sure what I was up to next. I woke up feeling pretty terrible.  At some point I had busted out my sketch pad and attempted to draw. I have no idea what because the drawings were terrible.  I also sent some Snapchats to an old fwb. I have no idea what I sent and I'm not going to ask. I had my Fitbit on so I used the sleep tracker to see that I had finally passed out at 4 am.  I had an important work call at 9 am. I don't think they could tell I was still drunk (working from home now) but I can't say for certain.

Something changed in me after this last drunk.  I'm not sure what or why, but this attempt feels different. So, like I said, I did all usually strategies to cut back or quit except for one: reaching out to all of you. I discovered this sub maybe a year ago but would only lurk when I was hungover and full of shame. I found the posts supportive and seeing the positive changes in others who had managed to stop drinking was inspiring. However, when that pain subsided, I'd start drinking again. I would have posted a few days ago but I wanted to make sure I wasn't just following the same cycle.

The last seven days have been really good.  I started reading This Naked Mind after seeing it mentioned numerous times in this sub and it is helping me.  I'm also shocked by how much energy I have after a few days without drink.  I thought I'd be bored out of my skull without booze but that hasn't been the case. Even doing chores is kind of exciting in a way now. Cravings have been surprisingly light or nonexistent. The one issue I am having is with insomnia. It is taking me hours to fall asleep, but despite that, I still feel more rejuvenated in the morning than when I got 8 hours of drunk sleep.

I don't know if my partner and I will fix our relationship or end it.  The thought of ending it was pretty terrifying last week but now if it happens, I'm okay with it. For the first time that I can remember, I actually have hope and believe that I can have happiness if I don't drink.  Right now that is what is important to me.

Thanks for taking the time to read this long-ass post.

As I navigate through my first summer sober I naturally have some feelings of missing out. ""I will never catch up with my friends, grab a case of beer/bag of weed, and hit the beach."" Seeing family having a few cocktails on the 4th of July looked fun and I felt a little left out. It's easy to romanticize the thought of drinking alcohol.

I appreciate groups like this because its a reminder of what drinking is actually like for people like myself. If I had one drink like my family was enjoying on the 4th it would have instantly flipped the switch and set me on a rocket ship of boozing and bad decisions until I made a fool of myself, passed out, and woke up with what felt like a 40-pound weight of anxiety on my stomach- the only way of quickly getting rid of that feeling was to hop back on the wagon and drink again (which I frequently did).

It is a relentless and brutal cycle mentally and physically. I felt trapped not knowing if I was ever going to get out of it. Also, who was I without drinking? It had become part of my identity. Everything revolved around that next drink, and the cycle continued.

I haven't posted too much in here and putting it in words makes me feel emotional. How far I have come in 11ish Months. I'm wildly healthier, my anxiety is better, I have hobbies, I remember watching movies, my relationships are better. Drinking is not worth it, it never was. We all have it in us to change for the better and have the quality of life that we deserve. Congratulations to everyone who has made the change for a better life and I really wish people earlier on in their journey have awesome success. Thanks for reading.

I've started walking 45-60 minutes in the morning and at 263, I've lost over 10 pounds (mostly water weight, I know) and my blood pressure is already improved, but I know steady-state cardio alone won't get me to where I want to be if I also want to be muscular and strong.

When I was drinking moderately in my mid-twenties, I had a 1,000+ lb powerlifting total, and I'm still strong, but not nearly as strong as I was. I had success with strength gains while hovering around 210 using Wendler's 5/3/1 program, so I was thinking of going back to that after giving myself a 4-week ""pre-season"" to get my body used to the movements at my current weight, then spending a week testing my new lower maxes, then do 5 cycles, which will bring me to that magical 6 month mark that only 5% of people make it to after giving up alcohol.

So here's what I'm asking: 1.) For those of you who quit drinking AND lost weight, how did lifting fit into the equation for you? 2.) Were you able to make strength/size/definition gains while also losing your beer gut? 3.) What program did you use?",4,0

I made it a year and half before I relapsed and I recently stopped again when I knew it was getting to be an issue. Lasted about a month - it was one drink/week then escalated hard the last week when I ‘needed’ a drink at work and then I stopped again.

I know I shouldnt be discouraged with one relapse but, honestly, the first time was easier to be like NO to the urges. Im not saying it was easier to stop, it was def harder with all the shaking and such, but it was easier to say ‘NO WAY ARE YOU DRINKING THAT’ than now.

I feel like I can convince myself that it’s casual more now than ever.

I’m in therapy and never miss my meds. I honestly have been debating if I’m schizophrenic and I have been on schizo meds for over a year which helps the seeing things. My first psych said the visions were anxiety induced but now we’re seriously looking at the possibility of schizophrenia with a new psych (i liked my first one but he graduated so I just saw my new person yesterday after not having insurance for 6 months).

Self medicating is such a hard thing for me not to do. I do have a therapist as well and we’ve been working on feeling uncomfortable....but I need a lot more work.

Not going to lie, I am really disappointed. My current job/career has been bumming me out for a long time and this other opportunity would have been an excellent way for me to segue into a different industry, while still using my strengths and experience. I even have a friend who is pretty high up at the company in question, and was the one who suggested me for the position in the first place. I thought I performed really well on the tests they gave me and was fairly confident that I was going to get it as of a couple weeks ago. Then silence for a few weeks and I knew it wasn't going to go my way.

But it's going to be ok.

I'm going to look at this as confirmation that I need to make a career change, and instead of relying on a third party to provide that opportunity, I am going to figure out how to make that change happen for myself. It's probably going to mean taking a leap of faith and going freelance, while also getting my own creative projects off the ground.

But I look at the person I was two years ago, and I feel proud of how far I’ve come. I’ve been fighting this thing for so long, And I’ve had glimpses of how it feels to be sober, in control, and at peace more and more often. I often feel lost, and wonder if maybe something inside me is broken, even while knowing everyone has issues and feels isolated at times. However, the despair and anguish that once was my baseline is now an occasional visitor, and lacks the despondent, consuming depth it once had.

I feel nostalgic, for the people I had in my life before my obsession with intoxication dictated our relationships. Or rather, before my obsession was known. It’s so strange but I romanticize aspects and feelings from my old life, most of which I was too addled to appreciate at the time. The friends I had, people I spent time with. The environment of my job at the time. That feeling of “freedom” that came from doing whatever drugs or drinking however many drinks because I could just ignore their destructive impact on my life. And I wonder if some of the women I loved would still be here if I didn’t choose alcohol over them time and time again. 

I know not to dwell on these things for too long, the past is gone forever, just a neural remnant, it does not exist anymore and pretending it does only breeds depression. But I’ve been in a contemplative mood for a few days now, perhaps knowing this day was coming. July 14th, the day everything fell apart. Turned to shit. The infrastructure of my entire life, instantly atomized. It wasn’t instant though. It was a long time coming, and as grueling and painful and uncertain as the last two years have been, I’m glad that it happened. I’m not happy about who I lost because of it, and I deeply regret all the suffering and worry I caused for those who love me the most. But I never would have changed if it didn’t happen.

I look at who I was two years ago, and I love him, I pity him, and to an extent I understand him, but I am so grateful he is a stranger to me now. I was in so much pain every day. Pain that I created with my decisions. Not just the destructive substance abuse, but the choice to remain unhappy. I still get depressed sometimes but if I’m sober, I’m happy 90% of the time. I learned to use my mind, not be used by it, and to be aware and accepting of my emotions, only because continuing the same heavy destructive cycle of avoidance and self medication was literally no longer an option. So today I am thankful for my many horrendous mistakes, the impact they’ve had on my life, and the luck that my recklessness and stupidity didnt end anyone else’s life, or my own.

I’m really sorry for the long post but I’ve been thinking about this all day. I only have a few good friends and I still feel that it would be annoyance for me to unload my sobriety/spiritual stuff on them. Maybe I’m projecting my insecurity, or maybe I haven’t stayed sober long enough to cultivate relationships with people who appreciate the same things I do. Either way I intend to find out.

fwiw the two medications i’ve been abusing are supposed to be non habit forming and “safe for addicts” but alas. my addictions psychiatrist knew in early april that i had started abusing one of my meds and wanted me to be hospitalized at the time but i was terrified because of covid, instead we settled in having a crisis team come to my house. i quit for a period, but have struggled to stay quit. i recently had like 30 days without abusing meds and but about a week ago i slowly started again and since being severely triggered on sunday night my abuse has escalated to a point that it really scares me. 

i have an addictions counsellor as well but both she and my psychiatrist are away from the office until early august. i’ve attended AA and NA before but not recently. i’m in another 12 step fellowship as well. meetings in my city have slowly started up again and i’m planning to attend an NA meeting on zoom tonight and an in person one tomorrow.

Bye. You are a subtle thing. You were not a part of the first 18 years of my life, and have effectively stolen 5-6 - perhaps more if you have caused lasting health impacts. I can only count the damage which has been done thus far, and hope that said damage remains static



I don’t know what exactly to say to you. I like you. I don’t like you. I know you but I don’t know who you are. You are not a person - you do not have a personality, yet I feel like I have personified you. You are not unlike a helium filled weather balloon. You pull me up. Initially flying sounds fun - to look down from the sky at the ground, the thrill I feel floating above the space I once inhabited. The chains of gravity are off, and I see others floating off in the distance also above the ground - kites, airplanes, mountaintops, hanggliders, etc. But I keep moving up, and after a while it becomes scary. I yearn for the ground again, or at least to be back at the height where I used to see my peers. Now the air is getting thin. The distance to the ground grows and grows, and what was once thrill becomes fear. Yet you keep pulling me up. I know at a certain point the air pressure will get so low that the balloon will pop. Then what? I don’t want to find out. The fall back to the ground will be hard and likely not pleasant. Though I will end up at the same elevation I was at before I started you, I am left shattered on the ground. A blob. A smear. It is not the same.



I don’t know why you are this way. I do not know why you do this to me. Why I do this to myself. I seem lighter to pick up off the ground than others - an odd phenomenon since you certainly have made me a heavier person at least in the physical sense. But I cannot say that I do not like you. I like you too much. Daredevils often say that they are chronically depressed and if you were to ask them how they were on a scale, they may say they’re at a 3-4 on an average day, where most people would say 6-7. They are not normal feeling unless they are risking their lives. I think my issue is not dissimilar. And yet, neither alcoholics and daredevils are known for their longevity. I have known people who have died from both. And I’d like not to join their ranks.



So I want to say goodbye. You are all around in our culture and life. I don’t mind it. What I miss is the taste of one or two of my favorite beers. I don’t miss the taste of your harder, stronger older siblings, and yet as I have risen further and further off the ground, those are the ones who have become more a part of my life. 



You are a liquid. I think that may be intentional. Liquids are borderless. They fill the space they are given. They spill. They soak. Drip. Seep. You fill the void that I have given you, and always seem to try and slink through any cracks I give you. If given the chance you will fill the void again. I try to keep you at bay by giving you less space, but there is no way to be continually full. 



Instead I’d like to replace you. With a non liquid. More an expansion foam. That fills the void, but is solid. It stays. And the void remains filled. What that may be I do not know. Therapy, meetings, my girlfriend, family, etc may be like the canister. Pressurized. Waiting like a spring. To pounce. To help. But someone must pull the trigger.



So goodbye. You’re a real bastard. Perhaps you’re more like UV rays from sunlight. That sounds about right. The UV rays from the sun are always around us. Damaging. Painful. And I guess I’m just unusually fair skinned. Some people can tan and absorb it. They darken and glow. You give them pleasure. Our society glamorizes it. We even have special spaces for both - bars and tanning salons. We are taught to chase you. To yearn after you. That you are a key part of adult life. But you burn me. You give me cancer. You do not help. I am leaving you.



So farewell. I know I’ll see you around again. I know likely I will see you around me soon. I see your billboards and commercials and ads and whatnot. So I guess I’m not expelling you entirely from my life. I can’t. But I do not want you to influence me. You can impact me like the moon impacts  the tides - I know you pull, you wax and wane, having a tangible impact on many people - both good and bad. However, living where I do,  you do not personally impact me. Let’s keep it that way.

So peace out Girl Scout. Take care - or don’t, it doesn’t really matter to me.",23,0

Today's chapter was about what to say to friends when they ask if you want a drink. 


The chapter revolves around how many people treat alcohol addiction different than any other addiction. Often times, instead of being supportive friends or family may try to convince me to have a drink, even if it is known that I am not drinking. They will say things like, ""come on, it's only one drink."" I've certainly had this happen in the past.

Annie explains this often happens because others dont want to be judged. If I'm not drinking, they could think that I am judging them for not drinking. Many people in my life probably don't know how much or how often I drank. They only see what I drank in front of them. 

To help this process of telling people go smoother, she suggests when I first start telling people to keep it light and joking and focused on me. 

This will come in handy this weekend when my family's vacation starts. I was a little nervous about that, but I feel like this advice will help. It also helps that I haven't been to this vacation spot as a heavy drinker so I don't have a lot of memories drinking there. Mainly, memories from my childhood.

Today I had an interview for a new job and it was a success! They hired me on the spot and I am scheduled to start on Aug 3rd. 

I don't share this to brag but rather to encourage others. You see I am not someone who deals well with change. Several years ago now I had my last drink of alcohol. It was a struggle, I didn't particularly enjoy being sober and I doubted myself most of the way. I did not get into incredible shape or advance in my career. I did not build oodles of fun new relationships or become a super successful sober person. I just quit drinking and that was the most important thing. Slowly but surely I became more comfortable in my own skin and started to like myself and my life better. 

I have been in a dead end job for the past 11 years that I should have gotten out of a long time ago. I just couldn't make the change, I was too scared of the unknown. I didn't believe I deserved anything better and it was what I knew how to do. I know in my heart if I was still drinking I never would have been able to take the necessary steps needed to make other positive changes for myself. I'd just be living for the next opportunity to drink. 

For some of us change comes slow and that's okay. All that matters is that we are trying to move in the right direction. Whatever stage in the game you are, I wish you well.

I spent a long time thinking I should be doing exactly this. Over the last couple of years I thought about it a often, but even before then it was on my mind. Then as the world was going into lockdown and everybody else was buying toilet rolls and pasta shapes. I was amassing bottles of vodka. Big bottles of vodka. And wine, but I'd almost given up on the wine by that point so it was really just vodka. Lovely, lovely vodka. 

That's when I realised I needed to do something. Make a change. I saw the lockdown as a way of getting away from some habits. Such as stopping at the supermarket on the way home from work.

The first couple of weeks seemed tough. The boredom, mainly. I drank because it was a lot more fun than not drinking. I had a few triggers also, but most often it was just a way of passing the evening. One of the odd things was that it didn't take too long before I stopped missing getting drunk. Yet I did miss the anticipation of getting drunk. Friday nights weren't an issue, but I still had that Friday afternoon mindset of ""I'm gonna get smashed tonight- oh, no I'm not. I'm going to have an orange juice and watch tv.""

It didn't take long before I noticed the benefits. I no longer had to have a pile of antacid tablets on hand 24/7. I've begun losing weight. I generally sleep better, and am less tired. I remember the things I said to people from the night before - I'm not gonna lie, that's a biggie! I don't mean shitty things, just conversations. The times when somebody says to me ""I know. You told me this last night,"" have almost disappeared. Almost ;)

I still have those same triggers. That same person trying so hard to make things difficult. I'm not going to let them though. They've been at me today, and my first reaction was STRESS! ""I want a fucking drink!"" But no. I'm doing this for me. I can't let them undermine me anymore. They're not going to get to me. I shall stare at my ""99"". Knowing it's my 100th day. Taking strength from it. Deciding that I don't wish to throw it all away.

I joined a gym, and as part of the membership, they set up a consultation with a trainer. Before the consultation, they gave you a questionnaire to fill out. One of the questions was ""how many drinks/beers do you consume on a weekly basis""?

So I start counting. Tuesday night- no- not really. Wednesday night, no, not really. Thursday night- heck yeah. Pre-weekend party time. I drink this many. Friday- oh yeah- I drink this many. Saturday- of course! I drink this many. Sunday we go the Reggae bar and I drink this many beers and this many Jeagermeisters. Monday night- yeah- Monday Night Football. I drink this many. I added them all up, and was like wow. I can't write that number down for a trainer. So I cut it in half and wrote that number down.

I go to the training session. The trainer is reviewing all my answers and came to that question. ""Holy crap"" she said. ""Do you know what this is doing to your body""? She was horrified. And that was just the half count.

That was 30 years ago. I should have listened then and checked myself more. But I was living at the beach in Partytown CA. How things would be a bit different now if I had listened. But I didn't, and here we are now. Can't change that. Gotta plow forward from here.

Naturally they're asking questions about her when someone asked, ""So does she drink?"" And before I could answer, someone joked, ""Would Okiespy date her if she didn't?""  It truly was a lighthearted joke and not malicious in any sense, but that exchange has always stuck with me.  

I've witnessed first hand family, coworkers, and former classmates spiral so I'm fully aware that alcoholism is a very serious issue.  I've watched from a distance, silently using them as my personal measuring stick to ""excuse"" my own drinking habits.  Sometimes their destructive drinking would serve as a personal warning to ease back (albeit temporarily).

That being said, I never truly felt like I reached the rock bottom that I've seen up close.  Between the work trips with free booze, to ""permission for having a rough day"", to celebrating a good day, to poker night, (or my personal favorite: while cooking).... it ~~wasn't~~ isn't uncommon for me to have 15-25 drinks a week.  While I can confidently say alcohol never became my crutch, it 100% became my unhealthy habit.  

Recently, my wife and I decided to start trying to make a family.  I made a promise to her and myself long ago when we first started talking about the subject, that I would participate in her 9 month's sobriety.  Even though she appreciates the gesture, she's adamant it's unnecessary.  I've shared this idea with my close friends before, and some have started doing this as well.

Well two day's ago, I decided to get a head start even though we're not pregnant yet.  Looking back, I can't think of a single week in the last 10 years that I haven't had a drink of some kind....  So even though I felt pretty strong yesterday, I know it's only going to get tougher.  Especially this first week.

Luckily, I have my best friend who's also doing this with me.  But I also come with some extra motivation:  My dad quit smoking (cold turkey) the **day** my older sister was born.  I've always ~~admired~~ lauded him for it, so now it's my turn to do the same for my future kid.

I'm 30 now. I've been trying to quit since this past January. I had a situation happen where I was contemplating suicide (I've dealt with depression too on and off since I was 16).  Occasionally when drinking it heightens it. I was texting my family that I was going to kill myself - I think this was more for attention than anything - and the cops showed up for a wellness check, ended up in the Psych ward that night. Went through IOP and attended AA for two months. Real eye-opener.

&#x200B;

Between January and now, the longest I've gone without drinking is 25 days.  Then, I did reduce my drinking somewhat, but this past week or two I have completely relapsed. I'm talking 7-9 drinks a night, 4-5 days a week. Talked to my therapist, we did this test (called AUDIT, The ""Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test""), I scored 27 of 40, anything over 20 is considered alcoholism she said. Another eye-opener & very sobering.

I have struggled with drinking for a long time. Years now. I stayed sober during my pregnancy and also during one of my probations. I have two DUIs. I've only been able to make it to two months on my own. That was earlier this year. I went from February to April. Now, I'm back to my weekly drinking. Every now and again I'll go two weeks, but not very often. 

I had a driving incident last night. I had FOUR bottles of wine in less than 24 hours. I needed more. And around 7pm I left. My husband wouldn't take me so I drove to the store drunk. I also took our baby. I ran inside the store, left the car running for the AC. I came back outside and realized that my car was locked. With my baby inside. The girl that worked at the store tried to help me get my car open. I was panicked that a cop would roll by. Accidentally locking my baby in my car and I was drinking. Automatic arrest. In a moment of desperation, I picked up a rock and shattered my window. 

I am a piece of shit. My husband is pissed. And I missed two days of work so I could drink and I lied to him about it. 

I don't understand why I keep doing this. My husband and baby mean more to me than wine. But yet, I keep doing it. I'd like to say that THIS is my new bottom, but I don't know anymore.",7,0

Ever felt the disappointment and frustration of NOT seeing those achievements fall into your lap after a certain amount of sober-time?

I’m almost at six months sobriety. I’ve been here before, twice. Both other times I relapsed back into consistent drinking at around the 6 or 7 month mark. So I know I’m coming to a potential crossroads. 

At six months sober, I have seen enormous improvement. But I haven’t achieved all that I thought would happen so easily with sobriety. 

Have I created a solid side gig? Have I lost weight? Can I do the splits yet? Have I gone camping? Have I saved $50k? Have I started investing? Have I learned and taught someone else a new skill? 

I guess what I’m trying to tell myself, and others here too, is: if you’ve been here before, don’t get complacent! Continue to have a sense of wonder about your sobriety. About your achievement within sobriety. If your goals haven’t yet been achieved, it means you and your body need MORE extended time away from alcohol to sort things out.

I’ve never made a post on Reddit before. But this isn’t something I can talk to my family about. They would probably tell me I am overreacting. You see, my family are all heavy, daily drinkers. My parents, my husband, both of my siblings. I live with my parents, my husband, and my two children. I’m the only one who has to go somewhere to work right now and usually, all of the adults already have a beer in hand by the time I get home in the afternoon. I feel like if I tell them I don’t want to drink right now, they would see it as me being judgmental towards them. I absolutely don't judge them. My family's relationship with alcohol is their own. 

I’m away from home on a work trip this month. I told myself that I wasn’t going to drink while I was here. I told myself that my reason for not drinking would be to drop a few pounds. I figured this would be the perfect time because I am away from my family and I won’t have alcohol around by default. Plus, due to COVID, I won’t be going out anywhere or have that peer pressure to go out. So far, I have kept my promise to myself and I’ve been sober for the past two weeks. This might be the longest I’ve gone without a drink in at least five years. 

But now that I am left to sit with myself in a hotel room, I realize that weight loss isn’t my only reason for not drinking. A small voice has been nagging me for a while now that my drinking is getting to be a bit much, but I was able to push that little voice down. It wasn’t until I found this sub that it really hit me. I can relate to so many of the stories here. How many times was I late to work last month because I couldn’t get out of bed on time? I even called in sick once for the hangover. I told myself I wouldn’t drink on work nights anymore and failed at that. At one point I found myself not looking forward to Saturday because I knew I would be hungover that day. Like it was a given that I was going to binge drink on Friday. Even being here without the temptation, it has still been quite hard to not go get myself a bottle of wine. I find myself rationalizing that a couple glasses of wine aren’t going to hurt anything. For that reason, I am so glad to have found you all. When my resolve gets shaky, I know that I can promise you all that I won’t go out and get a bottle.

I am nervous about going home in August. I’m nervous I’ll go back to my old habits since wine will be around me again. I haven’t figured out how I’m going to deal with that yet. But for right now, I know that I will not drink with you today. Thanks for listening. :)",25,1

July 5th was my 1 year sober.   


Alcohol is the bastard that won't leave me alone. Looking back at it's silly now how much of a grip the molecule had on my life. How dark those days truly were. Admittedly I wasn't as bad as some people can get (no shaming or anything), but I was super uncomfortable with it and slowly killing myself one liquor bottle at a time. In those dark days it took all my willpower to not drink a whole liter of whiskey on a Friday night. During week nights I would drink more ""casually"". During my early days of quitting alcohol I let a lot of shit slide, leaned hard into video games.

With the return of depression these last two weeks, and especially reaching the one year mark I've been really thinking about alcohol again for seemingly no reason. Primarily I used to drink to hide the fact my life is mostly devoid of all joy. I'm not going to do anything rash, hurt myself, or anything of that nature (I just want to make that clear) but part of me genuinely wishes for that temporary escape, to give into the urge, and drink until I pass out. Now I've been through this crap before, I know the little ""devil"" on my shoulder, and know that one small slip up, one sip, that's all that it'll take. I'll be right back where I was before. I feel as if I STILL walking on tight-rope one year in. I know what I'm so happy to have made it this far, but it fucking sucks I still have the cravings. They're a shadow of their former selves for sure, I'm winning the battle, that much is evident, I just wish they, the cravings would fuck off already.   


Perhaps it's just the incident that happened in June with the isopropyl alcohol (linked above), or simply just the return of some lingering depression. I really don't know. I don't plan on drinking. I just needed to get out some of my frustration.",2,0

Does anyone have any good recommendations for podcasts, videos, etc on gaining perspective and learning more about the psychology related to alcohol and drinking that they could recommend?

I'm keeping my badge, it's still a motivator/ceremonial thing for me and Saturday was a necessary step in my own journey.

Without getting too long winded, I knew at some point I would have to see what having a drink was like again.  I wanted to get some distance before I did this though, and for whatever reason I felt comfortable Saturday.  I was never strongly physically addicted to alcohol, my life was never in jeopardy when I quit, but I was a serial binge drinker for nearly 18 years.  My mental connections to drinking on certain days of the week, events, etc... were as strong as steel.  I've worked very hard in rewiring my brain's reward system in the last 6+ months, really investigated/studied my reasons for drinking in the past and how I could avoid the same level in the future.

So Saturday, circumstances had it where the environment in my house lended itself to an atmosphere... and I had 3 moderately high ABV beers, extremely paced out... like 1 per hour which was a far cry from my blitzkrieg of 6 in the first hour and then maintaining.  Even at this slow pace, the months without alcohol in my system was still allowing for a slight buzz to kick in.  At that moment though I felt serene, and I got up, poured myself a glass of water and started getting something to eat and like that, my experiment was over.  Over the last 6 months the hype of alcohol has withered away, and it did not live up to any hype Saturday either.  Just as I hoped.  It confirmed my choice in sobriety.  I no longer need this substance to have a good time or ""feel myself"".

I'll wrap this up, as I'm actually feeling self conscious and possibly judged by posting this.  It's a great moment for me, but I have a feeling some might not see it that way.  I know some people can't play with fire like that, and I completely understand.  This is not some kind of ""this will work for you"" post, it's just part of my shared journey that I need to get out there.  I know myself better than anyone, and I took an educated gamble and I won.  I know I will continue the rest of this year and beyond without a drop, but I needed that confirmation... that alcohol's sweet song did not sound good in my ears anymore.  It did not.

I had to come home and immediately cook a bday meal for my family (great planning on my part). I wanted to have a glass of wine SO bad to “perk myself up” and help make the last few hours of the day less brutal. Instead I pushed through cooking sober, with a big glass of iced lemon water.

The thing is that although I wasn’t drinking as much as last time I got sober, this last withdrawal is the worst I’ve ever had... up to day 6 I was sweating and craving and I got vertigo so bad while taking a walk I almost fell.

Good laying around reading or watching shows weather and as we all know, that’s about all that’s available to us for relaxing these days anyway in the era of social distancing, so I’m betting you guys are very caught up on reading and have seen every episode of every good show. I can’t wait to hear your recommendations. I’m sliding back into a normal life with normal routines now after a solid month of cross-country moving madness.

I’ve been reading a bit of Holly Whitaker’s *Quit Like a Woman* again. I’m leaning back into my quit lit as temptation seems to lurk everywhere in my new home state. There was a passage I really liked about what made her a drunk that really resonated with me:

“With every single instance of being told I was not enough, too much, gross, fat, dumb, loud, and wrong, I shut a door within myself. This is not acceptable, that is not acceptable, all these things are not acceptable, so you must suppress them. . . . Soon enough there were so many closed doors, so many places I couldn’t go or let other people see, that there was nowhere to live. So I left. I went somewhere else.” 

I’ve never felt that the usual addict stories define me very well. I didn’t have a significant childhood trauma, mostly, so I definitely don’t fit the textbook definition. But the passage above-- absolutely. She goes on to talk about how self love and eliminating the negative self talk and the feelings that drive them can be a big part of a successful recovery. I’m trying to focus on all the opportunities to treat myself well that don’t involve poisoning myself and making my life and my self happier places to be so that I don’t need artificial joy. 

I’m also reading a silly novel called *The Gifted School*, which is quite a bit of light fun after slogging through *Shogun* for what seemed like months! But I’m throwing in a daily few minutes of quit lit to help me stay focused.

I got home from the 2019 Oregon Country Fair, where I volunteer every year and where I’d had my last drink, and my best friend and I mutually decided to abstain from drinking for six weeks, as part of our preparation for Burning Man. In addition to being an incredible adventure companion, she has helped inspire many new things in my life, but I don’t think that either of us thought this would result in me quitting for good. That was not the plan.

At this point, let us record for posterity, I was drinking various kinds of alcohol, every day, three to six drinks a day, except more at parties! It had been a long time since I had gone more than a few days without drinking. What began as just a six-week pause (just a three-hour tour!) quickly became surprisingly compelling and meaningful to me.

Let me underline the surprise part. I did not mean to quit drinking for good! But after only a week or so, I felt that my thoughts had gone in a sufficiently new direction — just from experimenting with not drinking for a little while — to start talking privately with my friends who had previously quit drinking. They were amazing, and the interesting thing was that none of them tried to sell me on any particular way of thinking about myself or my relationship with alcohol — they all just encouraged me to sit with my feelings and explore them, and continue noticing what I experienced as I continued my short-term experiment.

You might think of Burning Man as a big party where alcohol is nearly ubiquitously available, and you’d be totally right. But Burning Man is also a great place to live experimentally. It was my seventh burn in eight years, and I found it easy and fun to burn without drinking. At Burning Man, after those initial six weeks were up, rather than start drinking again, I extended my goal to 90 days. At 90 days, I extended it to a year. I have now fully adapted to make it a permanent way of life. And I feel better, and miss drinking less, than I could possibly have imagined.

I’m stubbornly independent and did not do this as part of any organized program of recovery. That doesn’t mean those programs are bad or useless. To the contrary, they help a number of people, and as a criminal defense lawyer I work professionally as well as personally to connect folks with the resources they need. But not everything works equally well for, or is necessary in exactly the same way for, everybody. What I needed — what I always need in life — was simply to live in integrity with my close and loving community of friends. That has delivered and then some.

I did not crash and burn. I just caught myself drinking a whole bunch more, steadily, over time. So I’m not recovering from hitting any particular bottom. It’s been more a matter of being consistently pleasantly surprised by the ongoing, sometimes pronounced, sometimes subtle effects of living without alcohol.

Many changes to my body that I thought were the product of aging turned out to be quite reversible by simply not drinking. (Some were kind of weird, like I swear my hearing has gotten a little better.) To be fair, I have also been working out a ton, but at 46, I am in better shape than I have been since I was 22. There’s no way that would be possible if I were drinking.

I am incredibly lucky not to have harmed myself or anyone else in any irreparable ways with alcohol. I did do and say a bunch of stupid things under the influence of alcohol, but mostly I dozed off or slowed down to the side of events. I’m back to being my naturally boisterous self again now.

Anyway, I really did have a good run with drinking overall, and I mostly enjoyed it. But drinking from age 15 to age 45 was enough. And I realized it was enough. I sure am glad that I got out while I still could. The benefits of doing so are numerous and their number is continuing to grow. Among them is being better tuned-in to what all of you have to say.

I want to thank everyone on this subreddit for their amazing posts, documenting the good times and the bad. Right now I'm looking for some advice about approaching my partner to discuss my sobriety.

A little background: I drank every night for at least the last five years, usually polishing off 2 handles (3.5 L) of liquor per week. I must have been damn good at covering my tracks, because nobody ever mentioned my issues with alcohol. I've lived with my partner on and off (due to jobs in different cities), but she never caught me drinking or called me out on it. My plan has always been to sober up for 2-4 weeks, then to sit her down and spill my guts with the hopes that she will help keep me accountable for my sobriety. If it isn't obvious, this plan scares me shitless. Is this a good idea? Does anyone have any input on approaching loved ones to discuss your issues with alcohol, particularly when they seem to be unaware of the issue?

I don't drink on the job or before school and important events. I have never been belligerent or abusive in anyway. I've puked my guts out a few times a year but never blacked out and forgotten everything. But I know I drink too much for my health and have trouble stopping before my limits. I don't really have an immediate family that's affected, but I know my drinking is affecting me in a few ways 1) Long term health, 2) Occasional slight hangover at work maybe once or twice a week and 3)  I'm always so fucking tired.

The past two years or so I've pretty much drank either an 18 pack of beer in about 3-4 days or a 750ml bottle of liquor in about 4 days. It seems like a never ending cycle where I keep going a couple days of ""weaning myself off"" and drinking less then having a night of boredom or stress where I take a few too many shots and regret it in the morning for a few hours. Cold turkey hasn't worked either. I always find a reason to ""reward myself"" after grinding for a final exam or something. I think two weeks without a single drink is the longest I've gone in the past 3 years or so.

I drink because: I have what I'd call ""mild"" depression and have trouble finding happiness in most of my situations. Maybe this is the biggest cause because I generally am happier and enjoy social situations, games, and TV more after a couple drinks. I'm simply in a better mood. I'm the happy drunk as they say. I just guess I don't know when to stop sometimes. I've been cheated on a couple times in the past few years and generally have bad luck with relationships and maybe that's what made me get worse. Recent relationships were one girl getting pregnant by her ex the same night after I took her on a Valentine's date. The next one ended up having an affair with a married coworker. It's been about a year since, and I haven't tried dating because I'll probably have major trust issues at this point. I tried to be more responsible and spoke to a therapist exploring the options of antidepressants and medication for anxiety but my insurance doesn't cover enough to make it worth it. The extra finance costs and meetings would contribute to my existing stress of trying to juggle how many hours I have in a week with work and school. I've been told many times I'm more fun and open up when I drink. I feel like I need to drink to have a good night's sleep (except the morning regret for a few hours). I have trouble getting out of bed before work (usually get ready in 10 mins or less) and I take too many naps to make up for my tiredness.

I should mention that the first doctor I went to wasn't a psychiatrist but prescribed me anti-anxiety medication for what I was going through and forwarded me to a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist wouldn't prescribe me the same medication and wanted to explore more long term treatments which I understand. But that month using anti-anxiety medication I was drinking significantly less and felt happier overall. I can understand how addictive medication could be and don't necessarily want to trade one vice for another, but I think I was in a much better place during that time.

I grew up playing video games and there was this one game in middle school that I was obsessed with. I used to stay up every night playing each game in the series and even replaying them.

I replayed them plus the new games added to the series even through high-school and whatever new games from the series came out during my time in college I played them as well.

As time went on I didn’t have the time anymore or rather I didn’t make the time to replay the games like I used to.

Instead I was drinking more than anything and just trying to get through life and yes I would play games here and there I still wasn’t engaging with any of them like I used to.I was in a daze I felt like I was forcing myself.

The night of July 4th I couldn’t take the anxiety I kept having every night and day from just stopping drinking again.I told myself I needed to distract myself with something.Thus, I picked up my switch and started replaying the remake of the ace attorney games again.I played for hours and I laughed and smiled and I felt like myself again.I felt like that dorky kid who loved video games and cried when they ended(or depending on the ending lol).I felt like the kid who always loved video games and loved to play them for hours and was engaged with the story.

This might sound stupid but it reminded me that drinking took away that feeling of engagement,escape and love for video games(among other things).
So many times I chose a drink over video games after a long day to destress when gaming used to be that for me in the first place.

I feel like a part of me has come back where I enjoy one of my hobbies that I stopped enjoying within the past few years because I chose drinking.

I dunno like I said it might sound stupid but I just needed to play this series again because it is truly helping me to get through the night and not drink.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

""Don't cling to a mistake just because you spent a lot of time making it."" -Aubrey de Grey

&#x200B;

So what changed? When did I let go of the booze and choose to come back?

&#x200B;

I found myself sick and tired of being sick and tired. On the last day of February, I attended a holiday party. Earlier that day, I had looked up meetings in the city, and found one within walking distance of the party. As I stood by the bar, drinking club soda and lime, I could feel the anticipation building inside of me. Was I finally going to go back to ""the rooms""? As the final moments approached, the group was preparing to start the white elephant, a gift exchange. The time had come, it was now, or possibly never. I knew that not everyone gets a second chance, sometimes we hit a bottom that kills us. I pushed myself out through the bar door, walked the blocks to the clubhouse, and took my seat.

&#x200B;

What I didn't know, was how it would feel to raise my hand and be honest. I had the desire again... I wanted a life free from booze, but I was petrified, ashamed and feeling humiliated by all the memories and fear of failure. It was time to stop clinging to that old life, it was time to start again. It was officially my day one. All these days later, I find it easier to do this \*one day at a time\*. I went back to the party, after the meeting was over. One of my friends asked where I had slipped off to, and without hesitation I said I had a meeting to go to. I got another club soda and lime, mingled a bit more, said my farewells, and headed for the subway.

&#x200B;

On the way down the block, I ran into another smaller group of people, heading to the after party. One of the guys called out to me and said, ""Hey Fox, you're heading the wrong way!"" To this I answered, ""No, I'm heading the right way!"" and for the first time in a while, I actually was heading the right way. I was heading home.

&#x200B;

One of my favorite silly recovery jokes: Who has the most time sober? Whoever got up the earliest that day! 

&#x200B;

Have a good one, my lovely sober friends :)

There was a long time where I didn’t care if I died or not. I even thought my kids would be better off without me sometimes. 

Since the birth of my kids I was only drinking once a month but usually each time I was getting blackout. That one time a month caused such a depression in me. It is crazy to think that one drinking session a month changed my mood so drastically. It has been 4 months since my last blackout (did have a couple drinks almost a month ago)  and even with everything going on in the world this is the happiest I’ve been in a long time. I don’t know if it’s the feelings of shame and guilt from blacking out that send me into a depression or the alcohol it’s self. But I sincerely hope I never feel that way again. IWNDYT !",14,0

I have a degree in marketing, and wish I had done something different. 

I recently got switched to a new motion and I honestly suck at it. In my defense we got zero training or support. We were expected to produce on day one, while still completing our old responsibilities. I've been binging since I started it. It's been about ten days I think. 

Anyways, the way I see it I hate this career path so it has very little value. My roommate works at Target and he seems to be pretty content. A few jobs opened up there recently, and they will pay less, but not much less. My lifestyle would hardly change. I can see a career path at Target, and I've worked retail before and enjoyed it honestly. 

Im 25, so I know I'm still relatively young and have time to figure life out, but I'm so nervous. What if I'm screwing up an opportunity? What if I get good at this position in time? What of I'm not looking far ahead enough? I just know something has to change. I'm gaining way too much weight, my house/room is a mess, I'm so depressed/stressed.

I soooo get it.  Today, I had a late afternoon conference call and then a call with an executive at about 7 in the evening, and 104 days ago I would have been edgy, resentful, pissed off **all day** at having to wait to start drinking.  The second I got off the second call, I would have dashed to the liquor cabinet and poured the poison--not enjoying it, mind you, but just diving in to the pool of alcohol that I had missed so desperately by having to wait.  Ugh!  Waiting.

I haaaated waiting.  I hated having to put off drinking.  I had a job pre-pandemic requiring me to set up events that involved drinking at the end, and because I couldn't drink too, I haaated the event.  I didn't listen to anything anyone said, I just counted the minutes until I could go home and drink.  I hated waiting after conferences to officially be able to start drinking with dinner, and loved the conferences where everyone sprinted immediately to the bar when the doors sprang open.  I hated hotels where the happy hour didn't start until 6.  6??? are you nuts?  That's two hours late!  I don't want to wait!

That horrible, unfillable, bottomless pit of wanting.  It's never filled.  It's never enough.  It's never on time.  It's like drinking seawater when you are lost at sea.  It creates an insatiable thirst that kills you in the end.

Or two. I’ve laughed, I’ve cried, I’ve had numerous depressive and manic episodes. I knew through it all the best thing for me is to work for my sobriety. I don’t know what changed exactly, maybe I’m just tired of the chaos, the instability, the loneliness. But I’m in a place now where I really want it, and I’m really hopeful for how much happier a sober life could be. I promised myself when I left my parent’s house I would stay sober, but I guess the unfamiliarity of it all was overwhelming, because I drank the first night in my new place, and so began another ugly little chapter.

I’m so happy I made it back though. Addiction/obsession can be so incredibly frustrating, but I know by now that I’ll never stop trying to be free from it. I believe I am capable of never drinking again, and I can find a better way of living. Before I was convinced there will always be a part of me that wants to drink. Maybe thats true. But now I know there will always be a part of me that hates it, and will never stop trying to quit. A side of me that knows how much better life is without alcohol, that longs for that unshakable peace and subtle undercurrent of goodness and love. I’m gonna try focusing on that side of myself, and not feed energy into the nasty, bitter longing for euphoria and disassociation. I want to be here, awake and alert for everything in every moment.

I would drink copious amounts of alcohol for weeks at a time and then stop cold turkey. I’d repeat the same process constantly. 

I went on a bender this past March for a week. Well, Kindling caught up with my ass when I decided to quit. I started getting hallucinations, both auditory and visual, along with this impending doom/paranoid feeling. I honestly felt that I was knocking on death’s door. 

This is when I knew it was time to actually seek medical attention. I was good at detoxing myself at home, but this shit was scary, and I knew I could die if I didn’t seek medical help. I remember going to the ER and explaining to them my situation, and I sounded like I was drunk, but I hadn’t had any alcohol in almost 36 hours. I was then admitted and put in ICU. I was fine for the first few hours, and then this is when shit started to get real and I transported into this other dimension for three days.

The ceiling of my room seriously looked like it was breathing. The tiles were moving in a wavy-like fashion. I then looked out my window and saw hooded figures with red eyes trying to get through my window. 

Time was passing, but it also felt like it wasn’t passing. I thought my nurses were conspiring to kill me, so I would try numerous times to escape my bed but would trip the sensors, obviously. 

I then began to think there were these puppets in my room that were alive and just watching me. There was this one I called “Payton,” and some people were coming to see her because they were amazed at this talking puppet. I remember asking my nurse if he saw “Payton” sitting across from me, and he said, “therealdeb, there’s nothing there.” The “human puppets” I saw all of a sudden vanished, and I came to some sort of clarity.

Finally, after a few days, I was moved to the general floor because I was now lucid and not borderline schizo. 

I honestly think I was in an alcoholic’s version of hell for a few days. My doctors never told me if I was having DTs, but I honestly think I did have the DTs because I was conversing with imaginary figures and in this crazy dream-like state for days.

For the last five years I've done Sober October for various lengths of time and this January was the first time I made it an entire month. I used to beat myself up for days. I drink to calm my inner critic. Each time though I come here and learn something new. I would search for posts about hangxiety devouring every word trying to make myself feel better. I finally got on an anti-anxiety med last year and it helped me to get to the point of clarity to start doing the hardwork.

So don't beat yourself up. That's how we got here. Be kind. You'll slip up and make mistakes but if you keep going you'll keep learning strategies for the next time. It's about using your sober time to set yourself up for success the next time. Keep your home clean, keep working on you.

Not sure what type it'll be but at least outpatient.

I'm lucky to have a good support group (girlfriend, parents) and good friends who really don't want to see me hit rock bottom and not get up anymore. So tonight, once again, I'm gonna have to resist any temptation to pick up that bottle. And day by day, make that decision over and over again. I'm so excited.

Today is the day it ends. I learned at the end of last week, that my company was going to be doing a random screening. I figured it was for broccoli in my pee but it turns out it was for bac. Today I got a call from HR telling me to go in immediately for the test. Not concerned with the broccoli I had  already had my lunchtime 24 oz seltzer. Also that morning on my drive in I had two regular sized seltzers and another 24oz one on my 9am break. So by the time this afforementioned test occured I had already had a steady pace of those abvs. Thinking I could guzzle water in time to pass the test was the stupidest decision I've ever made in my entire life. There should be no reason I should have any bac level while it work. I knew about the test but still persisted with my rituals. Even over the weekend. So now my HR has ready results and I've got no idea what's going to happen from here. They say they want to help me so hopefully I don't lose my job and my marriage based on this stupid decision. I need to stop my consumption for good. I'm ashamed to admit that since my results I have continued to consume. I'm working up the courage to tell my wife what happened. But I know the more I drink the more emotional and incoherent I'll become. How can I stop this vicious cycle of self sabotage??? The answer is to rid myself of this crutch and blossom as a person!

They would drink and sometime they would get drunk, but I didn't. I would have people come up and ask me why am I was not drinking. I would answer, I don't do well with alcohol. I hated using the word alcoholic. it made feel like I was a part of  AA which in my mind meant that I would have asked for help.

  
After a year and half of sobriety, I suddenly started having withdrawal symptoms again. just this felt worse. so after having the shakes and cold sweats for a about an hour I call the AA help line. they told me to get to a meeting. so I did. to this day I still have problems expressing how it went. I remember calling my mom afterwards and saying, it was weird, but in a good a way though. so for 6 months I started trying to work the program. I got myself a sponsor. I would go to meeting 3 times a week. but every time the word god and powerless came up I got enraged. powerless is the one thing in my life have always refused be. I am many things, but powerless is not one of them. and how am I supposed to give my power over to a god I don't believe in. so on the day of my 2 year sobriety.

For the last 7 years I've been regularly in a ""I'm not drinking these days"" phase. I go for months without drinking, and then I try it out again. During those years I've told people, ""It's not that I can't control myself, or that I drink too much. I don't have a drinking problem."" but the fact is when I drink even a glass or two, there's a nontrivial chance I'm going to suddenly get **sad** for no reason. Sometimes I hurt myself in those sad times. Sometimes the sadness lasts for days and days. Driving my mental health off a cliff is a problem. If any amount of alcohol does this, it's too much alcohol. I guess have a problem with alcohol.

For the last 7 years I've been testing the waters, thinking maybe if I figure out the right circumstances or the right type of drink or the right company, I'll find a reliable way to drink that doesn't sometimes send me spiraling down into darkness. Writing it out now, it feels pretty silly. A 7 year experiment? Don't you think you know the results of the experiment by now?

In some ways, I feel like I don't feel like I fit in with this group, I don't see myself in the posts I see about binge drinking, but I guess it doesn't really matter how many drinks it takes, does it?  In a lot of ways I feel like I *do* fit in with this sub. I've been lurking for a while and drawing a lot of strength and inspiration from everyone. 

So I guess that's it. I'm tired of playing Russian roulette with my mental health. It's fragile enough! I deserve better.  The experiment is over. It's no longer ""I'm not drinking these days,"" it's ""I don't drink anymore.""",3,0

Comparison can help put things in perspective.,"I was on Hulu and noticed a documentary episode on Drugs, Inc. about a drug that came out of Russia and has spread to the US. It is an opioid derivative cooked from codeine and can cause serious necrosis and the death of nerves. People's bones can be showing. It is horrible. The average lifespan of an addict is 2 years.

Why am I sharing this here? Well it was shocking to see and the addicts weren't all that different in their behaviors from what I have seen with alcohol... from what I have done myself. The difference though is in the effects. Yes, liver disease, DUIs, relationship loss, and more are bad but not as bad as Krokodil. 

Yet for me this was a learning experience. Alcohol may often have slower progression of symptoms but that doesn't mean an alcoholic isn't going to die from it (slow and prolonged symptoms or sudden death from drunk driving). Any hard drinker is clearly highly likely to be reducing their lifespan, have poor health, bags under the eyes, poor sleep, stomach aches, bad skin, and more.

I have a feeling of comraderie with any addict no matter the drug. I hope we can all learn to live happier lives by learning about other's experiences. We can all try and help eachother no matter the addiction.

So, here I am, on yet another in a long line of ""day ones"", but today is an admission that  I am an alcoholic. 

It’s all sort of crushing, and maybe liberating to admit it. No maybes, or thoughts of “Someday, I’ll be normal again.” My “normal” is that I’m an alcoholic. I can choose to drink, or I can choose not to drink, but that doesn’t change what normal is. **I am an alcoholic**, and I choose not to drink as of today.

It's finally gotten to the point that I know I need to change this habit. Since the beginning of quarantine, like many posts I've seen, things gradually took a turn and started to spiral. Like many, I thought it wasn't so bad, but it really has gotten to be that way. I decided after this last weekends binge, I need to start tapering down and eventually stop altogether.

I've felt so terrible the last week and this last weekend only exacerbated that. After a good few days, I decided I need to try tapering down again. Had some success a few weeks back but didn't follow through. 

Last night was very rough. I think I tried to taper too quickly and suffered one of the worst nights sleep I've had in years. It's looking like it'll be a few days until I can get down to a safer point. Probably went from 20+ to maybe 7 over one day and it was no good. Thanks to the folks on here sharing their stories.

Today I am setting a goal to not drink until August 13, 2020. I know that it's important to take it one day at a time, but I also know sometimes I need to put limits on, and push myself.

I'd never called myself an alcoholic, but for 5 years I have been comfortable saying I had alcoholic tendencies. That to me now is silly, as I fit the description all to well. One that I am familiar with. 

Drinking has been something I've loved for a long time, but in the beginning of this year I embarassed myself and through despicable intoxicated behavior (drugs and alcohol) I ended up scaring away some of the best friend's I've had. I'm sure they feel as though they've outgrown me, and I agree with them. That has dropped me into a relentless depression, and the coping got worse during covid while working as a medic.

Alcohol and my abuse of it has been the common factor in all of my major life failures, has caused me to move to escape my reputation, led to the loss of a job years ago, and  a slip up in performance at my current job last week, has always made me the ""endearing screw up"" of the group and I'm tired of it. I believe the most I've gone without alcohol/weed has been about two weeks l, a few times, in the past ten years... It shocks me to write it. 

I am nervous, shameful, and faithless, but today I want to officially disavow my lifestyle of abusing, and try to occupy my time with pursuit of the dreams I've let lay dormant, because Ive learned, I drink to avoid the hard work thats in the way of realizing my potential.

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

This week's AoK is from [Yuri Williams in Los Angeles, who dresses up in superhero costumes and goes into children's hospitals across the United States to help uplift patients.](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2019/09/19/superhero-with-heart-gold-travels-across-country-cheer-up-sick-kids/) He started after his mom died of cancer in 2009, when he was in a ""dark tunnel"" of grief.

""I said there's something I need to do to get rid of this sadness that I have, so I decided to start helping people,"" he said.

I love that quote. I know that when I get stuck in negative feelings, I have such a strong impulse to sit there and think and think about where I'm at and what I'm feeling. But that doesn't change anything, that just keeps me stuck where I'm at. When I remember to break up constantly thinking about myself with thinking about how I can help someone else, it helps change my perspective.

I haven't been in the greatest mood lately, just dealing with a lot of life stuff, but this weekend I spent some time doing things that weren't just for myself. I spent some time getting a birthday present together for a neice. I called and texted some friends who have been having a hard time and asked about how they were doing. A lot of people have struggled this year, and it helps me to remember that I still have something to offer others. 

I also gave myself permission to spend time hanging out with friends, which is an important AoK for myself. Now that social distancing hangouts are okay again it's been important for me to get some social time connecting with others. 

I was hanging out with people after an AA meeting on Friday night, and someone suggested that we walk over to the lake and hang out there. I'm in Chicago, and the lakefront is still basically closed, and it's fully closed at night. We saw some cop cars but managed to avoid them by sticking to the pedestrian accessible areas.

It was fun. It felt like the sort of low-key trouble I'd get into as a teenager. The walk through the park was lovely, and it was so peaceful hanging out by the shore. The moon was huge and beautiful and not too far above the horizon, so there was a trail of moonlight across the lapping water that seemed to lead right to us. And it was nice getting to know some of my sober friends better, I'm getting to know new people now that I'm back at meetings in person, and that feels good.

Anyway, that's me for this week. How's everyone else, any AoK you'd like to share?",13,1

Earlier this week the A/C went out in my home and my pregnant wife and I battled 100+ degree temps in the house until the weekend rolled around. At which point the forecast was slated to close in on 120 degrees so I got us a hotel. Before the A/C went out I was exercising and running again but I couldn’t do anything with no respite from the heat. I was dieting and doing an exceptional job. I really wanted to clean myself up and be a better husband and a great dad. 
   Stress this week erupted with a combination of the heat, my job which is chaos on a good day, my wife could lose her job in the coming weeks, and trying to prep for a baby in December. I had an anxiety attack last night while still drunk. That horrifying sensation of not being able to catch your breath and your limbs and face locking up. I have been riding in and out of the waves of another attack this morning as well as battling my own body which is extremely unhappy with the decisions I’ve made. 
   I don’t know why I go back to drinking. I’ve not enjoyed it in years. I always, and I mean always, finish the fifth in a day, feel like death the next day, stop doing it long enough to forget that I hurt myself and that I’m ruining my body and my future. 
   I’m really scared these days. Obviously I’m scared that the bottom will fall out on my wife and me and we’ll lose our jobs. She’s facing being out of work or teaching 5th graders in the lousiest COVID state in the country and she’s pregnant. She amazes me, she might be concerned but she sure as hell doesn’t show it and she doesn’t have these lapses like I do. My fear makes me feel weak and that weakness makes me feel worthless.

I recognized a long time ago, I have a problem with drinking. My drinking is different than my friend’s or family’s. Once I start, I can not stop. Last year, one of my friends drank himself to death. Currently my best friend from high school is drinking herself to death. Concerned for my own health, I recently scheduled a physical with my doctor. Everything, and I mean everything, came back looking great. I know with the trajectory I’m currently on, if I continue drinking like this, my health is going to tank. I want to stop NOW before that happens. I figured today is as good as any other day, so here I am!

I’m posting this for two reasons. The first is I want some level of accountability. It sounds silly but I feel if I write and post my pledge to sobriety, it makes it more real. It’s not just another countless (drunken) thought of “I really need to stop drinking. I’ll do that tomorrow.” It’s dedication to a true change in lifestyle.

The second reason I’m posting is I’m terrified of withdrawal symptoms. I tried Dry January this year and was successful. No w/d symptoms. But come February, I started up again. In March I went a week sober. Again no w/d symptoms but I didn’t stay sober. I feel with lock down, and having no job, my drinking has gotten even worse. Do any of you fine people have advice on what symptoms to keep an eye out for? Or just general advice of how to get through withdrawal? Fear of withdrawal has been my biggest excuse not to stop drinking. 

Like I originally said, I’m really excited to start this journey. I’m nervous for the next few days but am trying to keep my mind focused on the bigger picture of a healthy, sober life. Growing up, my mom would talk about the phrase “Today is the first day of the rest of your life.” She told me how dumb it was and how she didn’t understand it. I remember agreeing with her. Now that I’m standing here, at a crossroads of “getting sober and being healthy” vs “continue this lifestyle and going down a dark path” I feel like I completely understand that phrase. I truly feel like I can make the right choice that will better my life. Today can be the first day of the rest of my (sober) life.

Any reduction in alcohol consumption is an improvement. I  just don't believe forced moderation produces the quality of life that sobriety brings, and in my opinion is less honest than just being a drinker, because its a false and forced condition. 

For me moderation was hell. I can do it for a time. I  can drink just one, and walk away. I just absolutely didn't  want to, so I forced myself, hoping I would reset myself somehow. The result was misery. If I drank 1, It took everything I had to not drink another, all my waking hours were full of me planning how much to drink, when to drink, then not drinking another one.  I was so focused on drinking, I had absolutely no fun, at the social events i went to, worrying about drinking to much. Then there was the bonus blackout binges. Ironically during my 3 year attempt at moderation, and in spite of significantly reducing my total volume for the year, I binged to blackout more than i ever had before. Usually days of heavy drinking followed, before I started the cycle again. The effects on me were anything but positive, pleasant or even remotely beneficial.

I found sobriety easier than moderation. Thoughts about drinking last only minutes, and are far easier to deal with, with no alcohol in me, nearly impossible with so much as a sip. 

The reason is simple. As a heavy daily drinker, my brain immediately responds to alcohol at the level I last drank.  Our brain chemistry works to balance the alcohol.(Alcohol Explained by William Porter, has a great explanation on this)Remember the first time you drank ? How much alcohol did it take to get a buzz, versus the last time you drank ? This is because your brain has become efficient at countering the alcohol. ( this is why so many people who get DUI's say they didn't feel drunk, though the b.a.c. was well over the limit). This is also why after an extended period of sobriety, many drinkers will find they need to drink just as much as before, within a very short period of time. Our brains don't forget how to respond, it just takes one or two episodes of drinking, to get the chemical production back into high gear. Alcohol Tolerance is the physical manifestation of this chemical balancing in our brains.

I had attempted,much like so many before me,to find someone like me who had returned to drinking like a gentleman( inspired by Bill W's big book of AA) that i might return to ""normal"" drinking, with no more success than anyone previously had. 

Edit: I now believe that normal is  a matter of perspective. I do not consider it abnormal to not drink. Sobriety is normal for me. 

I have not quit drinking forever, I simply choose not to drink today. 

I didn't give up fun, instead I found Joy.

Is it easy ? Not always, but its worth the effort.

I was thinking this morning that maybe the term ""alcoholic"" in itself could be problematic and may keep people who have a troubled relationship with booze from stopping. 

 I know that for me, for a long time, the term ""alcoholic"" conjured up thoughts of the guy under the bridge with a paper bag in his hand, the guy that cant keep a job or a relationship because he has to drink 24/7, etc..and while that's real for some people, for me, it enabled my drinking for a long time because I was none of those things, but I absolutely had an abnormal and problematic relationship with alcohol, and I knew it...but I thought it was ok because - despite my drinking to excess and all of the bullshit and pain, embarrassment, shame, and anxiety that came with it... I had a good job, a house, friends and people that loved me, and I was generally (and surprisingly) doing ok in life.  So I kept drinking because I hadn't yet lost it all.   I hadn't become what I envisioned an ""alcoholic"" to be. 

I guess this is just my way of saying to those folks wondering if you should stop drinking.... you dont need to ""achieve"" the stereotypical ""alcoholic"" lifestyle before you try to get sober.  Alcoholism, like most things in life, is a spectrum, and there's no one place on that spectrum that you need to be before its ok to give it up.  You dont need to lose everything, or even a single thing, before it's ok to admit that maybe you dont drink like most people and maybe you should examine your relationship with alcohol.

If you're like me, and your relationship with alcohol is, at best, an inconvenience,  or at worst, threatening your health,  your job,  your relationships, or simply keeping you from being the best version of yourself,  and you have even the slightest hint that maybe your life might be better without it, give it a shot....for a week, a month, 90 days...whatever.   Just try... you have nothing to lose, and everything to gain. 

So rather than thinking ""am I an alcoholic?"" maybe we should simply ask things like  do I like the relationship that I have with alcohol? Is it adding anything positive to my life? Would my life be better if I got out of this relationship? 

Hi..my name is Ack-J and I had a shitty relationship with alcohol, so I broke up with it on 1/28/18 


Sorry for the random morning ramblings, and I'm not sure if  ya'll are like ""wow that dude's crazy"" ..but wanted to throw it out into the universe in the hopes that maybe it helps at least one of you wherever you are on your journey.

Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone for such nice comments, it meant a lot to me. 

My partner came back home two days ago. That means I'm two days clean. He obviously wasn't happy with the fact that I started using and drinking but he isn't going to leave me. In fact, he helped me find a psychiatrist and after I'm done with detox I'm gonna start attending NA meetings. It's not gonna be easy at all and honestly I'm scared. But I am going to do my best and I'm already trying really hard. I managed to shower and I eat as much as I can without vomiting. My partner is staying for two months and it doesn't seem like a long time but I want to enjoy it while it lasts. I'm scared of how things will change when he leaves again. It's not even about having someone to check up on me, it's just that loneliness is seriously messing with me. But I guess that's something future me is going to have to worry about.

If anyone has any advice or at least could tell me what to expect with withdrawal in the long run I'd be very grateful.",2,0

I went out shopping with my daughter and her boyfriend. Afterward we went to Mexican food. My mind reeling the entire time...the internal dialogue...The devil on my shoulder was wanting to go day drinking, the Angel stayed mostly silent at first. When we got to the restaurant, I looked at the margaritas being served and day dreamed...I imagined myself having a nice cold,frosty, salty one. Then my mind wandered to this thought: if I had one, I would be obsessing on getting the next one. Like a crack addict searching for the rock they just know they dropped on the ground... I would have to keep my cool after I finish my margarita and try not to order more.. I would only have two drinks max so I don’t look like the addict that I am, and end up causing more pain and embarrassment for myself. I would have to make excuses as to why I had to go home... so I could be free to get more booze... sheesh... pondering the thoughts of me having to do all of that work  was exhausting, so I just decided to have the Diet Coke and some fatty enchiladas 😄

Liver issues?","So I have posted here on and off since December 2019. My interest really started with fear because of liver pain and very high enzyme levels(400+) a year before I started posting. 

As of now I have a very fatty enlarged liver(19.5cm) and probably low level alcoholic hepatitis. But my GP is not a liver guy and wants me to go to GI to be sure. 

For those who stumbled upon my old posts, and may have similar questions that I’ve searched for endlessly. Here is the timeline. 

- Started drinking at 16(32 now). Always knew I liked it a little too much. But it was only at parties and such until later. So maybe once a month at most. 

- Began training and fighting MMA in 2007. Lost tons of weight, got healthy but continued that binge drinking maybe once a month. 

- Had last fight in 2013 and had kids. Drank almost daily(1-6 beers) for about 2 years with binges when going out. 

- In about 2015 I got scared I would get withdrawals(never did). So my booze brain just decided to drink every other day at most. 

- Over the last 5 years I have stuck to the every other day or less strategy with rare exceptions but my quantities have gone up and up. 

- Over the last 2 years it has never been less then 14 drinks when I drink and sometimes up to 20+. 

- 18 months ago(Jan 2019) I was diagnosed with MS. When in the hospital(we thought it was brain injury from my old fighting), liver enzymes came back over 400. Doc didn’t seem to care and advised to just cut back. 

- Didn’t cut back, amped it up because of my depression over diagnosis. Was doing 18+ 3-4 times a week. 

- Aug 2019 had another liver test. Numbers were down to the 200s. But was still drinking harder then ever. I developed liver pain, chronic diarrhea and various other issues. Didn’t stop. 

- Dec 2019, joined here and put together various 2-8 day sober stretches but always went back to the 18 beers every other day. 

- Feb 2020 found a broken blood vessel on my face, panicked. Quit for 9 days and got more bloodwork. Numbers were down to almost normal and doc said I was fine. 

- Rona 2020, really amped it up and even broke my never 2 days in a row rule quite a few times. Liver pain worse. Feel like crap. 

- June 2020 ultrasound can finally be done. Fatty liver and enlarged to 19.5cm. No blood work done yet. Keep drinking. 

- July 10 2020, go to a newly reopened bar. Get stupid drunk and realize how dumb that was to go out. 

- Sober for the last 3 days.

So sorry for the long post. Hope it helps others who are wondering if they should get checked out. Or if they could have hurt themselves in such a short time period or by no drinking everyday. In my opinion and my experience yes you can. 

Also hope this is always here as a reminder to me. 

It took about 7-8 years of moderately high increasing to really high drinking to maybe seriously bang myself up. 

I am now 32, still uncertain of how much scarring and damage is done until I see GI/hep. And still at some level want to drink, gosh our brains are sick. 

I will update here as my diagnosis clarifies and becomes more certain.

I wrote this out to share on my other socials tomorrow but I want to share with you guys first. For without you, I am not sure I would have made it. Maybe I would have, but I wouldn’t be the man I am without this group. I thank you all, no matter your badge number, endlessly. 

I spent years trying to find something that couldn’t be found. An Impossible feeling. Impossible in that the thing I thought would get me there, was the thing keeping me from it. 
I was obsessed with it. I was the one doing the drinking, but it was the alcohol that had consumed me. Drinking had become the only thing I was interested in, and I did the majority of my drinking in solitude, so I could hide just how deep I had fallen. 

I don’t know if I hit rock bottom. Maybe I hit it a few times and didn’t notice. But one day I decided that living that way, if you could call it living, was going to kill me. So I stopped. 

Sobriety isn’t always easy. It’s confronting when feelings you’ve been suppressing for years with a liquid fog, come to the surface. But with the bad, comes the good. I cry at things that might seem silly to other people. I’m just so happy to be experiencing my life with a clarity that had long eluded me. I’m beyond grateful for my family, who have been huge supporters of me. Particularly my darling wife, who has listened to me when I needed to talk, and guided me when I was struggling to find a path. Pure, boundless love. 

Sometimes I get asked if I miss it. The answer is a simple one. There hasn’t been a morning where I’m up early, drinking coffee in silence, and sitting down writing in my journal, that I wished I had drank the day before. I am yet to wake up on a beautiful Sunday morning and wish that I was hungover. 
It’s never happened. 
I hope it never does.

Tonight though, one of my friends was texting me and it was clear he was drinking- I hadn’t set the boundary yet. I told him I’d been tempted to drink lately. He took this opportunity to text, verbatim “have you considered that it’s okay to drink? Just don’t drink too much? If you drink with me, we’ll keep it light. You’ve got the power, girl.”


.......k

So clearly I didn’t unpack all the frustrating parts of those sentences because he wasn’t sober in the convo. Instead I clarified that I’d like to continue being sober and that it wasn’t helpful for me to be having conversations with anyone while they’re drinking. He accepted it but said he didn’t understand how that mattered. 


Idk I’m just disappointed in that reaction. The dude knows that I regularly attend AA. That drinking was a significant issue before. Seems frustrating that he’d take my temptation as an opportunity to offer to drink with him. 

Just wanted to vent because I hope at least one person on here will understand.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It was February of this year, and we had just gotten to the venue, having skipped the opening act because we were at a weekly happy hour. Abysmal Dawn was playing, and Vader was next. At the time, I had no idea as I sipped my beer, that this would be one of the last shows I would see, before everything in the world would change. The next morning, I woke up, pulled a beer out of my friends fridge, and looked out over the street to the doggie daycare below. One of my friends joined me on the balcony, as I smoked and drank and started to feel the hangover fade in reverse, back to intoxication. That was what it was like, before I finally decided a couple weeks later to stop drinking, again. 

&#x200B;

I used to hear people say ""If you don't remember your last drink, you haven't had it yet."" I don't remember my last drink, but I do remember that morning. I look back now, and consider that beer ""my last drink"". However, my recovery didn't begin until I started doing the work. So what? ;)

As hard as it is to feel emotions sometimes, it is important to feel them and go through it. They pass - even without alcohol they pass. And for every negative emotion you numb with booze you numb positive one's too. I felt really alive today.

I immediately turned the switch, for my wife and got my kids out of there. Then I went to the basement, cut the power and disassembled the fan. Come to find out it wasn’t properly installed by the previous resident and one of the wires became dislodged. 

The moral of the story here is if I was drunk or in the middle of a whiskey bent sleep there is no way I could have handled that. It could have been a million times worse. Chances are I wouldn’t have woken up in time.

I couldn’t have it in my shoulders anymore - it’s my only secret and intense shame I hold.  The denial is so deep it only sometimes crept in and heavy guilt weighed in on me when I let it.

To anyone that is struggling... you will get there too. I only just begun to travel up this road. There will be speed bumps, but you can handle them. There is color in sobriety. Allow that navigator in your life with an open mind to find your way. Narrow mindedness has stopped a lot of innovation. I have the chance to live two lives in one lifetime. I wasn’t a participant in life. I was merely just a spectator. This all changed when I became sober taking one day at a time. I’m able to be present in the moment. I’m able to show up when I’m needed. I learned the gift of the pause... and a pause is all you need to make life changing decisions and do the next right thing.

I've enjoyed it. This last week I have been feeling more productive and more determined to make and set goals. 

Today's chapter was about alcohol cravings and how relying on willpower to get me through the cravings is like arguing with a toddler using adult logic. The more time I spend not giving into the cravings the easier it will become. 

That part resonated with me. In the past, my cravings would argue that, ""I put in a lot of manual labor for the day and I earned that beer"" or ""I've  made it almost a month, I think I've learned my lesson. I can moderate now."" Shockingly, it never works out that way. 


So, when I get cravings, I will distract myself. Running has been helping. My biggest trigger is a renter I am not getting payment from and cannot evict due to the current pandemic. I've been trying to keep it in the back of my mind that I will deal with it when I can and there is no use getting worked up about something I cant currently change. However, every now and again that frustration surfaces. Running has helped. It releases the endorphins that the first glass of alcohol would, but I dont do something stupid when I am done with my run.

I didn’t want to go as I knew there would be drinking but my 6 year old daughter wanted to go so bad to see and play with her friends. So I found some non-alcoholic beer called “partake” (Canadian company) which has only 10 calories and 0 carbs (I’m trying to lose the booze weight). I brought them and I had 2 and felt like I fit in, had a great time and zero urge to grab “a real drink”. I’m wondering what the groups thoughts are on non-alc beer, is this a potentially dangerous move to have a few of them on weekends? My husband seems to think so. Your thoughts are appreciated!!!

Been 9 months sober from booze after years of destroying my health and close relationships. In those 9 months, I’ve taken back up distance running and football (soccer), sorted out eating habits, and rebuilt previously destroyed relationships.

In spite of this, I’ve been having a tough time with strong urges to drink recently with the pubs reopening here in the UK, and with family and friends frequenting them every other night. I find myself becoming preoccupied in romanticising about previous drinking sessions and frustrated that I can’t just “go for a pint or two”, like my pals and family.

Day SIX! I can’t believe it. I feel great today for the first time since I started this. Slept for 11 hours without moving a muscle. 

I wanted to write down a little timeline of my withdrawal for my own edification and maybe to help other people. I’ll try to keep it short. (Spoiler: I did not keep it short)

Background: 31f. My family (mom and husband) are very supportive and have been absolute rocks through this process. Only been a drinker for about three years, ironically because I’ve been scared of becoming an alcoholic my whole life. Progressed to daily drinking (4-5 a day) about 2 years ago. Progressed to daily bingeing (8-12 a day min, beginning at 10 am, sometimes killing a pint of vodka a day) about a year ago. I never did anything without a drink in my system. Apparently I was right to be worried about becoming an alcoholic! Admitted I had a problem and needed help to my family about 6 months ago. 

Day 1: in a great mood because I finally found the strength to stop. Tremors started in around 8 pm. Thc and unisom to sleep (still doing that so I won’t repeat it). 

Day 2: Full body tremors. Constant elevated temp of 100 or so. Sweating constantly. Still in a great mood, almost euphoric like I’d taken some other sort of drug. Sugar cravings like whoa.

Day 3: bye-bye good mood, anxiety and cravings take over. pretty much sat on the couch all day. Shakes calmed down but killer headache begins. pain in my kidneys and stomach. Still fever and sweating. TMI: pooped my first solid poop in over a year. Drinking LaCroixs like they’re going out of style - popping the top of the can and hearing the bubbles helps calm my craving. I drank 35 cans of lacroix this day. 

Day 4: sweats have stopped. Still shaking, headache is worse, kidney and stomach pain worse. Sugar cravings stopped which was nice because I’m not a sugar junkie. Wild mood swings today, between euphoria and severe anxiety. I realize that the numbness and tingling I’ve been experiencing in my feet for over a year is gone, wow! Still going apeshit on the lacroixs. at night while trying to sleep, a really scary episode of full body shaking like I was freezing cold that lasted about an hour. Slept well after that. 

Day 5: fever still, shakes intermittent, headache even worse somehow. took Tylenol for the headache, it didn’t touch the fever. more productive today, spent the entire day making pour paintings and drinking lacroixs. even cleaned up the dishes. was able to watch an episode of house that was pretty much entirely about alcohol without freaking out (I did drink seven cans of lacroix while watching it). Gross but: took a shower for the first time since I started my detox. showering was one thing I always made sure to be drunk for, so i was avoiding it. did my whole skincare routine, which I haven’t done for months. Felt like a million bucks after.  Slept well. 

Day 6: woke up feeling on top of the world. Headache FINALLY giving me a break. Fever still spikes occasionally but overall more normal temp readings. Kidney and stomach pain gone. shakes have calmed (so far today anyway) to a slight tremor in my hands. Realized the severe acid reflux that caused me to quit my first love, coffee, about a year ago (bc obviously the alcohol was more important) is GONE. Omg, maybe tomorrow I can have a cup of coffee! feeling nervous about leaving my little detox bubble (my moms spare room) but I think I can handle it. I think. Maybe one more day. 

I know I’m still in early days, but the biggest thing I’m learning is how deeply disordered my brain was in the grips of alcohol. it was like I was a puppet and the booze was pulling my strings. gotta go to the store? Drink first. Shower? Better have two so you’re nice and relaxed. Going to work? Minimum of four drinks beforehand. potentially stressful encounter? three vodka shooters. why? WHY? 

I have no idea why. I try to follow the thread of my thinking with a sober mind and I cannot. I know my drinking began with realizing how much calmer and more relaxed I was in a social setting with some booze in me, but that’s about all I got. I’ve always had really bad social anxiety and I always did things anyway. I work in entertainment. I’ve acted on a major television show. I’ve met and worked with more famous people than I can count on all my fingers and toes, and I did it sober (and also drunk, my high functioning alcoholism did me no favors). I think the alcohol made my anxiety worse. funny, I thought I was drinking to make myself better. Oops. 

I’ve had the inevitable moments of shame pop up. Shame that I was drunk for this major event or that one. Shame I spent all of last Christmas, which will probably be the last time I see some of my older relatives, pickled at the bottom of a vodka bottle. Shame for all the times I’ve driven drunk. Shame for tricking my husband and my mom into thinking I was drinking less than I was. Shame for fooling my employers into thinking I was a trustworthy individual. 

maybe I’m letting myself off the hook too much, but I have to keep telling myself that I was sick. I was very, very sick, being ravaged by the disease of addiction that I’m both genetically and psychologically predisposed to. My addiction is not my fault, but it is my responsibility to fix. Just like if I’d broken my ankle, I could spent my life hobbling around with a damn broken ankle, needing assistance from other people to live my life and in constant pain...or I could take my ass to the doctor, get it fixed, be on crutches for awhile, and do the physical therapy to restore my body to where it’s supposed to be. I’m still sick, I will always have this inside me, but at least I’m taking care of myself now and not ignoring the problem hoping it just magically goes away one day. 

I’ve set a goal for myself to not drink for 30 days. Not that I will resume drinking after that, but that’s as far ahead as I can think right now. It’s a manageable number of days. I can’t think about forever right now. but I can hold onto how good I feel, how proud I am of myself, how proud my family is of me, and how present I feel in my life, for today. 

Here’s to Day 6. Tomorrow doesn’t exist yet, and I will not be drinking with you today!",29,0

Alcohol was my only escape 6 years ago when my brother passed away. I struggled with the drink so bad I pushed my immediate family away and became a verbally abusive father. When I had enough one month ago I poured out every remnant of alcohol I owned in the house. I poured out a handle of Jim Beam Apple, the remainder of my Jagermeister, and 20 Bud Lights I had in the fridge. After that last drop I felt an immeasurable weight lifted off me and I could breathe again. I hit drinking water hard to flush everything out of me and opted to working out shortly after a few weeks when I turned a negative choice I made while sobering up into a positive one. I now weight 223 pounds(just checked a few moments ago) from 265 pounds a month ago. My ""beer gut"" is gone, my face has slimmed up a whole lot, and the best part I became a better father to my kids. I'm grateful for the friends and family that have backed me up during this whole ordeal and here's to many more months and years down the road to being sober.

1870,2020-07-12 13:27:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hpy7ba/taking_a_break/,Taking a break.,"Hi everyone! I'm brand new here. 

I'm taking a break from alcohol, starting today. I'm not saying I'll never drink again, in fact I think I probably will. I like the taste of many drinks, I like the ritual, and I don't believe that I have a problem with alcohol. 

What I have is a mindless habit. I started thinking about it in the last few weeks and I realized that I don't remember the last time I went more than a day without a drink. Usually it's just one or two, usually I don't get drunk. 

I want to live my life with clarity and intention. I think it's alright if I have a beer because I want a beer, but now I'm looking at why I want it. Do I want to be a person who drinks every day? Might I feel better or different if I didn't (probably!)? Do I actually want alcohol, or do I want the ritual and something ""special"" to end the day or unwind? 

So, yesterday I made the commitment that I won't drink from now through August. I'm trying on sobriety, I guess. I want to break the habit. Realizing that a lot of my drinking is focused on wanting something cold or something special, I'm going to stock my fridge with sparkling water (cold!) and invested in some of those spiffy non-alcoholic elixirs that Facebook keeps putting in my ads (what are you trying to say, Facebook?) for a little something special at the end of the day. 

I'm glad this community is here. I have to admit, I feel a little uncomfortable talking about my drinking and intention to cut it out with most of my friends and family. They're all wonderful and supportive people, and would totally have my back...but I'm realizing I think they would worry about me. And then maybe worry more should I have a drink after August. I have an ex-husband who was a hardcore (and hidden) alcoholic, it's definitely affected the way I talk about alcohol with those close to me. 

So, thanks for being here. Thanks for being a place where I can share where I am and figure out what kind of relationship I want with alcohol, if any, and how that fits into my relationship with myself.

And those feelings bring me peace because I’m not fighting with myself anymore about what I should or shouldn’t be doing. 
I’m also thankful to no longer be slowly killing myself everyday. It took me a long time to love myself and value my life and before quitting drinking I realized that I want to grow old and I want to be healthy and old for as long as I can.

I've spent years in therapy for anxiety, depression, ptsd, etc. The one thing I never tried was long term sobriety...so here I am.  I am so tired.  Tired of the crying, the dreadful thoughts, the loneliness in crowded rooms, the binges, the inability to be the person I want to be.  I hope this is a lasting first step.  8 days.  Cravings happen...for the booze and the smokes, but I've made it 8 days.",5,0

Things like “I can have just one” (no, I usually can’t, and if I do stop drinking before I fall asleep then I spend all my time thinking about how much I want another beer), or “I’m not as much of an alcoholic as that person”, or “I won’t have a social life if I don’t drink”. I know that none of those things are valid excuses for drinking, but that’s where my mind goes. I just need to figure out how to stop thinking these things, or to think something healthier loud enough to drown out those thoughts.

They lasted probably way longer than they should have (6+ years of trying to quit) but they weren’t for nothing. 

Everything is better on this side. The sun is brighter. Mornings are happier. Sleeps are more restful. Emotions are more even keeled.

Didn’t think I could call myself an alcoholic because I don’t drink/crave it daily, but when I did drink on the weekends mostly, I couldn’t stop. I had a particularly embarassing time on the 4th where I blacked out at a family/friends BBQ in front of my (hopefully future) in laws. My bfs dad is an alcoholic (sober now) so I’m sure he noticed right away.  I woke up with some of the worst hangxiety ever. Not only was I anxious about not being able to remember my drunk actions (probably antics if I’m being honest), I also was so sad I couldn’t remember the holiday! We were at a BEAUTIFUL lake house and I know I missed an amazing sunset and fireworks, good food, etc. Finally realized I needed to change something. Like it’s easier to normalize and justify this behavior around my friends (a lot of who are heavy drinkers) but this was different. Especially because I don’t often care to moderate but I told myself ahead of this party that I had to, and yup..what do you know..after 3 trulys that went RIGHT out the window. 

I felt sorry for myself all Sunday and finally on Sunday night I decided to look to reddit which I have only ever explored a few times. Found this group, read some posts, was amazed how many people have the same issue as me, and finally realized I can’t battle this alone. That’s where I’ve gone wrong every other time I said “I’m never drinking again”. I didn’t change my thinking at all. On Monday I bought ‘This Naked Mind’ since it’s been so highly recommended, and I listened to her podcast which I actually might recommend more because it’s short episodes and easy to digest the info especially if you’re not a reader.

It’s insane to me how quickly my mind made a switch like I truly (lol no pun intended) am not tempted at all. Even though I have def been tested especially this weekend. You know the regular tests like being around people drinking, in general it’s summer and there’s people eating /drinking outside that I can’t not see. But also larger tests/ triggers. For example yesterday hanging out with my family (there are some deep issues there) and I was the only one not drinking. But still, didn’t cave. 

It’s like the veil has been lifted. This is my first weekend sober in a long time and I thought it would be sad and I’d feel like I’m missing something but it feels so so good!! I already feel like my life is changed for the better and I’m a better person! And waking up without a hangover on a beautiful summer day...life changing.

In addition to adding Saturday Shares to our weekends here at SD, we'd like to feature a health, sports, and fitness thread on Sundays. Many of us are motivated by weight loss or other health and fitness goals and this will be a weekly space to share those victories (or commiserate if you're struggling in those areas).

We are looking for a volunteer or volunteers to host this thread. We'd ask for you to commit to a 3 month tenure as host, near the end of which you will ask for someone else to take on hosting duties for the next quarter. We'll need you to write up the post either later Saturday evening or very early Sunday morning, then message the mods via modmail to let us know it's up so that we can sticky it.

The only requirement is that you have 90 or more days sober. You don't have to have racked up a bunch of fitness achievements personally in order to host! Just an interest in that aspect of sobriety is sufficient to make you a good host. 

So leave a comment here on this thread if you're interested and one of us mods will get back to you.

Went 5 days - over did it with shots. I didn’t even want to be drinking that day and ended up wrapped around the toilet. Went another week so turned off to drinking and here today rode the line with 5 or 6 drinks. So when I say it’s my first month, I’ve drank less this month than any given year of my life since I was 16 or 17 - I’m 27 now and I’m trying, I love myself healthy. 

The death of my mother last year and her two year fight with cancer rapidly drop kicked my drinking into a spiral. Any sort of social or occasional drinking became binders 3 days a week. Airplane bottles into pints of jaeger after work. Immediately. I couldn’t even tell you how I functioned at work, it’s as if last year never happened. I look forward to recovery. 

So as brief as I could introduce my problem, I’ll get to my original post question. I’ve been experiencing a type of raw irritability to a lot of things and people and I don’t know why. I’ve never been an explosive person, I’ve never had a problem controlling myself in a work setting with coworkers. I didn’t have a filter before in my own way, but now I even find it somewhat inappropriate or displaced. It just spews so sharp before I can stop it, I regret it immediately most of the time. Guilt ensues and I misrepresent myself and often wonder “who the fuck was that?”
I have zero patience and I’m just edgy and simmering. And I’m starting to believe after looking at my month, that I’m not simmering at my idiot boss or some coworkers. I’m not simmering about the responsibilities of my job. It’s something else. Other people can feel it silently, I can tell.

Is this related to cutting back and mostly being cold turkey for weeks or (week) at a time? 

Are there different forms of irritability pertaining to sobriety at first, gets better with time? 

Please share any experience, it will be helpful.

2) I get trashed, annoyed and something and start some ridiculous fight with my husband. Then fall asleep (has happened plenty of times)

3) somehow manage to not do either 1 or 2 above, but the drinking goes well into the night as family will stay over my house. 

4) with all scenarios above, the end result would be my sleeping crap, waking at 3am and feeling wretched, not remembering what I did/said, and being massively hungover for work when I have a really important board meeting in the morning. 

So, it was a no brainer really and yesterday I sent a text out saying I wasn’t drinking today, and I can give lifts home to everyone. 

I still feel a bit anxious, but I think it’s just FOMO as physically, I’ve been feeling so much better for not drinking. So my fridge is stocked with AF Heineken and 2 bottles of Nosecco. I’m anxious, but I know later on tonight I’m going to feel so proud of myself.

I fell out of touch with some friends, as I'd really only see them while drinking. I was dealing with my partners recent life long illness diagnosis. We moved back to my parents house to try and save for a mortage. My mother was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Then a pandemic & lockdown happened.

I'm aware these all sound like justifications, and in some way that's how I'm presenting them?

But honestly i feel like i just need to articulate them.

I feel like i need to tell somebody, and where better to shout it than into the faceless void of the Internet?

I drank last night. I drank a lot. On my own. I tried to hide it from my partner. He knew. You can't hide that kind of drunk.

And today, i feel like shit. 

Today is gonna have to be day 1 again. It's gonna have to be 1 day at a time from here on in.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

&#x200B;

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I've been really bingeing recently, and was trying to figure out why, so I experimented last night.  By ""experiment,"" I mean timing, journalling, accurately measuring liquor amounts with a scale.  I had 10.5 oz of whisky last night in 3 hours.  3 drinks, then 2, then 2, on the hour.

My conclusion is that I've gotten to the point that the amount I need to get a buzz/mild euphoric feeling is **more** than the amount that will make me sick.  I've read about people who black out drinking too much and their spouse has to clean up their projectile vomit, etc, (something i've done), and I think this is what ends up happening to a lot of people.  Realizing that I wasn't getting a buzz, I dumped the 4th hour's 3 oz of whiskey down the drain...

It also occurred to me, after my first drink, that the one single drink is enough to interfere with anything very fun except watching a good movie.  I can't even play a good video game well.  It also interferes with anything having to do with my health over the next week.  Skateboarding with your daughter... maybe one less minute of it for having had a drink the weekend before.  Getting well-rested, lying in bed reading a book on Sunday?  Concentration is not as good and your body is repairing damage from drinking rather than repairing your normal wear and tear.

Maybe drinking at one point could have given me some small amount of psychoactive euphoria, but it's impossible to get anymore.

It's time to focus on things that will give me holistic joy.",17,0

I pulled off bc I wanted to stop drinking and he wanted to continue, which was the single main reason why I set back.","He told me how he feels and felt about it.

And I'm confused.

So, if anyone's up to reading this, I'll give you some context.

I'm currently with a group of friends on vacation, we rented a few summer houses by the lake and we're spending the weekend swimming, playing board games, talking. And there's, of course, lots, lots of booze involved. Not everyone is that much into drinking, but aforementioned friend (let's call him F) is enjoying his wine just fine.

A few months back I was very upset when despite me telling F and another of our friend (I'll ca her B) that I'm not up for Saturday evening drinks and stuff (I was trying to cut off alcohol and I was rather avoiding drinking occasions), they insisted on me visiting them anyway. F remembers them having a civil conversation about B's last life events which included her moving from one country to another etc. I remembered them being visibly drunk, loud, ignoring me trying to talk too, and reiterating on a point with different words before quickly going to another subject.

Like I don know. It's normal stuff, I guess? I was just feeling left out and overwhelmed with their loud voices and something I'd describe as lack of connection and repetitive communication. Just drunk people having fun with me in the middle, where I wasn't supposed to even be here.i shouldn't have left the house that evening.

I left them after an hour of me trying to enjoy things and only getting more irritated, sad and tired. I was done when F asked me if I'm sure I don't want a drink, bc I look like I could use one. I found his comment to be unnecessarily snarky (as in ""why aren't you enjoying yourself properly?"") I told them I'm too tired to cope and that I need my sleep. We said out goodbyes, they thanked me for visiting and I took an Uber home.

This is where I turn into asshole, I guess. I was never good with expressing my honest opinions on things. I get irritated with people pretty easily, drinking allowed me to elevate my tolerance for things I'd otherwise find null and uninteresting. This became my go to in social situations simply to be able to bear them.

So the following day I told them in a group chat  of us three pretty much what I said above. That I did not enjoy the evening. That they were loud, and I'm not up to joining drunk people while sober and after I very clearly expressed that I don't want to drink. That I felt disconnected with them. I was angry and tired. Their words were sluggish, the conversations was repetitive, I was more than unnecessary in this whole scenario.

As you can imagine (or not? I certainly did not imagine that at that moment), crap hit the fan.

B said she's sorry and hurt to hear what I said. F started to - in his words - counter attack me. That I'm suddenly ""above everyone else"". That he knows ""EXACTLY where this is coming from"". That I feel superior to other people and always had been. And that it is MY CHOICE to resent him like that and that he wants me to remember that it was ME who rejected him trying to make me feel good.

The conversation took a nasty turn and quickly it was him being angry and trying to prove me a point I don't think was ever there. That it stems from my overly high esteem, that I don't care about hitting people. That I'm suddenly turning on him.

I left it in a messy spot when I decided it was getting too messy and emotional. I apologized for hurting them but stayed by what I said, that this was not good for me, as simple as that. And I thought if he's so surprised with that, perhaps he doesn't know me as well as he assumed he did?

Anyway we met after that and apologized to each other. We talked sober (I specifically asked him to please not drink while around me, just please). We tried playing some video game that was utterly stupid. I quickly became irritated again. We tried to talk but I felt like we disagreed on many things. After that evening we met again, but this time he brought w couple of beers. I was so done. I may not have asked him to please stay sober with me on this particular evening, but then again, I told him I need to stay sober and I'd very much prefer him to support me on that and please don't drink around me, especially if we met with just the two of us and there's literally no party to go around.

After that we met again on sever occasions but never really got back to being full-scale bff's like before.

So. Flash forward like 2-3 months. We're sitting in the night, it's like 2 am and it's our first opportunity to talk alone in a long time. I asked him how he's been doing and all. I told him I'm a little worried for him, remembering how much he drinks almost everyday (we're talking like 2-3 bottles of wine at one evening). I told him that I worry that he might be drinking too much, as simple as that. After a few months I was able to tell him lots of new stories about me, while he went with just ""it's all old shit, nothing new here"".

He asked me why I'm asking it NOW. That yes, we're not talking much these days, but do I remember whose fault it was? I told him I don't see the reason to be placing the blame anywhere, but he's free to have his opinion on the situation. He told me that what I did was a really shitty thing to do, that I basically threw away over a decade of friendship in one 30 mins conversation. He said he felt awfully hurt and even when we met afterwards, it was never the same (""yeah, cause we weren't hammered as usual"", I thought). That I seem to forget that we talked a lot and bonded well in the last years (""but we were hammered most of the time"" I thought). He told me I made B cry with what I said and I left him hurt and having to console her. I asked him why didn't she come with that to me? She could've easily tell me how it is. F said it's a thing about empathy to understand that not everyone cope with the situation the same way I do (which would be trying to work it out with the person in question). Like - fair enough. 

But it hit me. I told him I feel like we haven't talked in years now, not two months or whatever. At this point I didn't want to get back to discussing drinking.

He told me I act as if I expect everyone around to fit into this ""big change"" of my life and when he didn't fit, I tossed him away. That he feels that to me he is a reminder of a life I don't want to have anything to do with anymore.

And I kept thinking that even on this weekend I've been getting irritated and bored, especially with the loud party games which they often play after consuming some beers and weed. Perhaps I've even pissed off some people? I spend a lot of my time alone here, simply bc I'm not interested in drinking nor some of their conversations.

I'm just. I feel for him. But somehow - we talked while he was finishing his second bottle of wine, so I was a little taken aback because of his sluggish expressions and the general things alcohol do to people. He told me he feels as if I went through some epiphany, turned my life 180 and now expect him to follow, but he's still the same guy.

I told him that I'm sorry this conversation ever happened, but it's something I've been feeling for a while then, so it's not just out of the blue nothing. And that maybe my way of telling things was not kind enough to not cause pain, but despite this, I do not feel bad about it. I literally feel guilty over not feeling guilty over this mess.

I'm sorry for long ramble. I don't know how to process this properly.",1,0

Because I needed to exercise actions which showed that I was actively combating my addiction and doing the work to fixing my addiction was the only thing I wanted to talk about. Thankfully there was plenty of people in daily groups that wanted to talk about the same thing, some of them with years of sobriety. I did what they told me to do, read the big book, found a home group, got a sponsor.

Everything was fine, then COVID hit, meetings were cancelled...

Between constant video meetings at work and my Toastmasters group, I had zero interest in AA zoom meetings. And guess what, everything is just fine.

Now that I have a bit of time under my belt, I wake up in the morning and I choose not to drink because I like my life better this way. I accomplish more in my personal life like daily chores and fun activities, I'm more productive at work and I feel SO much healthier both mentally and physically.

I've never been religious, spiritually maybe, I believe that the universe is one of the many powers greater than myself.  But I can't fully and honestly say that I can get behind the giving myself over to God part, even if that is to be interpreted as the God of my understanding. And I'm just not ever going to get there.

Sure, my drinking days were filled with plenty of bad decisions. Mostly the decision to pick up that first drink despite my better judgement over and over and over again. But beyond that, I made some good moves in my career too... I don't believe that God made those decisions for me, I believe that we still have the ability to choose our actions and face responsibility both bad and good.

Trying to work through the steps with my sponsor has really made me reflect on some of these moral differences and I'm just not going to get there. I lost it at step 3, I'm not going to turn my will and my life over to God, even if that God is the universe I don't believe that I should lose my will and my life.

Sooooo... I came clean and told my sponsor. She is of course telling me that the program has worked for 85 years for a reason and trying to get me to listen to different speakers.  I think about what the world was like 85 years ago and see that times have changed and think the program needs an update.  Some of the fundamentals are great, drunks supporting each other, talking about what keeps you moving in the right direction.  But there is so much I can't agree with.  I need to have an open-mind and willingness for the program to work, and I gave it both of those, but at what point am I allowed to say it's not working?

Isn't the sober journey about becoming your true authentic and organic self? Here I am trying fit myself into an 85 year old mould because a bunch of people in a room tell me it's the only way to be sober?

I wrote this post in hopes that you might share similar or opposing views because I was feeling a bit uncomfortable after the text exchange with my sponsor.

I know speaking up was the right thing to do instead of going through the motions and pretending but know I've got a case of the ""oh shit, you're on your own now... Better not fuck it up agains.... ""

Thanks for reading, I feel better just getting that out.",19,1
1945,2020-07-11 21:00:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hplkvb/addiction_a_solution_rather_than_a_problem/,Addiction - a solution rather than a problem,"I did some serious self-reflection last weekend and wrote an article about addiction and self-worth - two things that many of you can probably agree go hand in hand. Here's an excerpt from it, which talks about viewing addiction as a solution rather than a problem. I hope you can take something positive from it and I'm more than happy to hear your thoughts on this idea :) Anyways, here you are:

Society has lead us to believe that addictions are a personal problem, fueled by hedonistic pursuits of pleasure. Society then attempts to provide solutions to the problem, which commonly consist of legal punishment, incarceration, and public shaming. The problem with this viewpoint is that it lacks any amount of empathy/understanding as to how someone becomes an addict in the first place, as well as why these addicts struggle immensely to kick their habits.

An interesting thing happens when we decide to flip society's take on addiction on its head - by viewing addiction as a *solution* rather than a problem. A solution for what you might ask? Well to start, we're (obviously) all humans that have natural wants/needs. These consist of basic survival needs - food, water, shelter, etc, but humans have also developed more complex needs such as the feeling of belonging/approval, social status, creative expression, and making a difference in the world. 

Throughout history, humans lived their lives on a quest to pursue and meet these needs. The problem with modern-day society is that there are many forms of gratification that hijack our brains and become substitutions for these needs. These forms of gratification consist of things like drugs/alcohol, gambling, shopping, unhealthy food, social media, porn, video games - the list goes on and on.

It's easy to demonize somebody who is addicted to a substance that is considered societal taboo like heroin, but the reality is that the person spending opening up Instagram on their phone 200 times a day or the person with 3 maxed-out credit cards due to purchasing name-brand accessories are no different. All of these people are addicted to things that provide a modern-day substitute for their basic human needs. In this example, heroin provides its addict with a sense of control and comfort, Instagram provides its addict with a sense of social connection/belonging, and the name-brand online store provides its addicts with a sense of social status/approval. 

The problem with these solutions in each case is that the addict isn't *really* having their needs met. In fact, their unfulfilled needs are actually being compounded by their addictions. The heroin user's addiction is causing them less control and security in their life, the Instagram addict actually feels less connected after looking at everyone else's relationships and social lives, and the online shopping addict's social status is about to come crashing down the second their credit card bills go to collections.

Seeing addiction in this light allows us to understand how addicts end up addicted in the first place - they have the same human wants/needs as anyone else but have fallen for one of modern society's plentiful substitutes. This is why it's important to show empathy towards ourselves as well as other addicts in our life - it's really easy to fall for these traps and we're blasted in the face with them every day. A crucial part of overcoming addiction is recognizing that these habits aren't *actually* fulfilling our wants/needs, and devising a comprehensive plan for pursuing alternative habits that will fulfill those humanistic desires.

Why do you want a drink? They don't understand that the torture of it all is I am stuck inside my head trying to figure out why myself, I can't think clearly because I am trying to fight that other side of me. I refuse to make sense of it all - my day was full of things that I would have normally done drunk and now that I am home with nothing to do. I want to kick back with a drink. Boom - craving. 

Why I am having a craving isn't something that is asked when ""normal"" people go out and have drinks. Well, but why are we going to have a beer while we watch the game? It's not something that a ""normal"" drinker asks themselves when they pour a glass of wine at night. The difference is that I have to tell myself no. And that sucks. And therefore I am asked, ""Why? What happened?""  

Nothing happened, certainly nothing I should be internally beating myself up for. Sitting here thinking to myself the night is going to be ruined because I want a drink and I can't have one. I should be praising myself for conquering yet another feat, almost gracefully without even noticing. 

Lately I have found myself far too negative about my sobriety. I am really missing those first days you break out and you start feeling like you have had it wrong all along. Because the reality is the craving (even the bad ones) go away and I am not sick. The night is still the same as it is every other night since becoming sober, and dammit I have so much to be thankful for it. I did have it all wrong and my body tells me that every day.

The overarching question to reflect on was: when I begin to crave alcohol, what's really going on. I like that question, because it makes me pause and reflect on why I'm feeling the way I am and find the root of the emotion.

Yesterday was great because I was productive and crossing items off my mental list. So, I decided to finally finish filling my taxes. I had them filled out online months ago, but then I found out I owed money, that I didnt really have, and decided instead of solving the problem, I would just buy a 12 pack and let it be another days problem. With the tax extension running out I felt like I should probably get them in soon. Well... the online tax papers, which were complete  now need a few additional details from the tax forms (that I no longer have access to) to verify that it's me. Also, even though my taxes haven't technically been filed, the online company still took money out because they asked for payment before I got to that last page of double checking. I wanted a drink so badly at that point. However, instead of dwelling on this I went for a walk/run and came up with solutions. First thing monday, I can call HR and they should have the information stored.

I thought no, I'll give it a go as I can't avoid this forever, there will be trials in my life like this.

The whole experience from a sober perspective is so strange. A huge chunk of my life had been spent getting wasted with friends, now I felt not a part of that.

Table service only in the uk allowed me to order an alcoholic looking beverage so that I didnt get pressed on why I was not drinking which helped.

I soon realised that drunk people are really boring!! It's just a game of who can talk over who the loudest with the most impressive story! I used to manage a pub and leave at the end of the day with my ears ringing! Now I know why! 

I only had slight twinges of cravings, more from the feeling of being left out really, we only had one and politely left. I did notice that I was a bit snappy and irritable for an hour after, but I think that was more frustration. Why am i like this, why can't I drink sensibly and have fun with everyone else? I felt a bit better when I got home and realised that it's okay and actually the majority of the people I was with probably have an unchecked drinking problem too. 

A bitter sweet part was I saw one of the couples from last night this morning and they clearly had a severe case of hangxiety - something regretful had clearly happened, and while I would not wish that upon anyone it was like looking in a mirror, but no longer seeing myself in that reflection.

My mother has let go of the saddle and I’m really doing it. Hope to shit I don’t fall off!

So in summary:

The good

- No hangovers. The first 5 minutes in the morning I smile and thank myself I’m alive. 
- I don’t hate myself. I slightly hate the fact I wasted time and didn’t do this sooner but fuck it. 
- Possibilities. I can do so much now! I can drive anywhere at any time for any reason. I can exert myself physically whenever I want. 
- wellness. I take an active interest in myself now. I monitor heart rate, have thought about some fitness challenges, I’ve meditated a bunch, I drink tea now (man that sounds boring). 
- I’m confident. Not sure why or what about but yeah. 
- I’m hopeful. I keep thinking about what I want to do with the rest of my life. 

The bad

- I haven’t lost weight. Not that I care and I’m probably only like 10kgs over what I’d like. I have replaced some boozing with eating to be fair. That’s my next challenge. 
- My relationships. Yup, my sobriety has not suddenly improved my relationships with my friends and my wife. If anything, I have become something they didn’t sign up for. This isn’t the me they know. I’m different now. I guess it’s understandable but it makes me feel so alone. I’m doing this alone and putting distance between myself and others in the process. I think my wife is almost resentful that I chose to do this and thinks I did it for myself and sacrifices her for it. Makes me sad. 
- I can feel again. Ok this should be a good thing I guess but I’ve had headaches, tiredness and all sorts. The sad thing is that this is for lots of reasons. The booze just covered them up. I’m not trying to eat right and sleep well etc. I treated my body like shit for too long. I hope I got away with it. 

Anyway, happy bloody weekend and happy Saturday. I’m going all in for another month. IWNDWYT",9,0

My brain has been trying its hardest to get me to cave for the last five hours or so. It's exhausting trying to ignore the whispers. I've eaten a ton of junk food, drank an ocean of soda, tried distracting myself and then exhausting myself - I still feel like the devil on my shoulder has a loudspeaker. I've just tried sleeping it off, but insomnia and the aforementioned devil won't let me get there. 

I've never been able to get past this feeling. I get upset and lonely, and the urge crescendos until I give in. I'm very good at identifying my emotions, but beyond terrible at knowing what to do after that. Hence, I drink them. 

I'm posting this hoping that typing it out will help. I don't have to act on how I feel. I don't want to act on how I feel. Well, I very much do - but only because I want a break from my emotions for an hour or two. The sickness I feel as I waste tomorrow being hungover will not be worth it. Not being able to leave it at one night of drinking will not be worth it. The money I spend, that I can't exactly afford, will not be worth it. Missing days of work will not be worth it. It will be so much easier to suffer through this than it would be to try to pick myself back up months later if I drink tonight. 

Whew. Talk over. I think I've convinced myself. I also think my pink cloud well and truly burst today. It's ok, though, because I can get through this. I can do this. We can do this. 💪",5,0

I'm ready to be done with it.  Yet somehow I find myself continuing to buy beer and drink it in secret until my wife catches me.  I've told her the truth now but I think this time was the last straw for her and we're basically going to live separately in the same house (fortunately there's lots of room) until we work out what to do with the pandemic situation.  I was ready for that while under the influence but now I'm really regretting the situation I created.

Add to that that I didn't sleep at all last night and my back and knees are hurting me (which is a new thing for me as I get older) and my health insurance recently stopped covering my current doctor and I'm feeling hopeless and overwhelmed.  

I know I need some supportive relationships to help me in recovery but my wife is pretty much my social network and I've alienated her.  She thinks I should go to rehab but I've read so many bad things about it and there's a whole bunch of other steps I could take that are less extreme and my understanding is that the least intrusive option that works is the best.  So far I saw a therapist for awhile but ducked out of that when I failed on my moderation plans and didn't want to face it.  Basically I've been reading lots of books about addiction and just trying to quit on my own.

Today I took the new step for me of attending an online meeting through smart recovery and I liked that.  I'm also planning to try to schedule therapy again on Monday but again the pandemic might add issues.  There's some other problems with my marriage which is probably part of why I've continued to put it at risk but today it is seeming like a really bad call to have put it in jeopardy in this context.  

I've quit smoking and other drugs in the past on my own once I decided I'm done and feel motivated.  I'm there now with alcohol so I think I'll be successful but the whole pandemic situation adds another element of difficulty.  Anyways, thanks for listening.

Last week I wasn't doing to bad, i was trying to limit myself to just 6-8 drinks a day. But the last few days it has gotten into the 16,17,18 drink range. I have an app on my phone that I use that tracks how many drinks I've had based on what I've drank and the ABV etc. 

So, obviously 6-8 drinks a day is a lot to a normal person, but for me that's nothing. But considering the last few days it's been much more than that, I'm getting concerned. Luckily, I have Clonidine, Remeron, & Xanax (street xanax)

I've detoxed from alcohol many times in hospitals, detox houses, at home etc and the anxiety attacks and racing heart is the most difficult to deal with it. 

Any suggestions on how I should use the medication on hand to taper the alcohol down? I've never had a seizure due to alcohol withdrawals, just the shakes, extreme anxiety, racing heart etc and this relapse hasn't been thaaaat long so with the medication I have on hand I'm sure I can get through it.

Throughout  the day when I start to ruminate about any negative memory, belief, idea or thought  where I feel quilt and shame I immediately forgive myself and all others completely.

I believe that I cannot grow, change and achieve my goals if I carry the burden of  negative emotions and feelings.

Forgiving myself  and others is the best way I feel to focus my energy on the future activities  and actions in-order to live a healthy productive life.

My whole body/mind feels clean when I flush out all the stuff I've been holding onto; when it creeps back up again I just stop and let it all go.

I was very tired of how my life was going and I realized, I hated who I was. Something wasn't right, it just wasn't working. I knew I have struggled with depression/anxiety for a long time but I wanted to delve deeper because I always felt like there was still a piece of the puzzle missing when it came to my mental health. Also after having my son being diagnosed with ADHD it made me go, ""holy shit, he is a mini me...and everything he is going through, I have gone through already. And struggled. Constantly.   


Yesterday I was officially diagnosed with combined ADHD, clinical depression/anxiety, C-PTSD with markers hitting in some other mental health issues. But shes not worried about those ones because its just some of my answers and family history brought up a couple markers but not enough to warrant a diagnosis. My doctor is very hopeful that my anxiety and depression will ease up once we start to treat the ADHD that has been running my life for 30 years without realizing it. I was bawling through the entire assessment because it just validated my feelings about my mental health. I KNEW something was missing. I KNEW there was something more to then just depression and anxiety. All these questions, showing me that yes, my struggles were so.. so valid.   


During the assessment it did go over substance abuse. I chuckled and said well..yea lets really delve into this. I remember at 18, I was in an mentally abusive relationship where I was extremely suicidal.  I had attempted to take a bunch of pills when I was younger but I hated that. So I sat there, on my bed at 18 (legal age where I lived to drink) and said ""Fuck it, im going for the slow burn. Ill drink myself to death."" I decided that day I was going to drink myself to death slowly. Boy do I fucking regret that choice. I was broken at that point. I have been broken for a while. But im done being broken.   


I have gotten through this much, I can get through more. I have gotten this far in life by sheer force of will and absolute insane amounts of stubborness and sadly alcohol to fuel me on. Well no more alcohol. Now I know that my brain works differently, and I am learning its ok to accept that fact. It's not going to get me down. I am going on meds, I am starting a different diet for other health reasons (yearly kidney stones at this point), I am trying my best to live sober. I am becoming a better parent, a better spouse, a better person. I can't get better mentally and help myself if I am fueled by booze.   


Its kind of funny, I feel like I always bounce all over the place, in my life and I have tried so hard to curb who I really am. Because I have been worried that if I just let loose and was just fully me, I would be WAY to much to handle. So I withdrew HARD into myself. Now...I just want to lean into it. I don't want to hide any part of me anymore. It may be jarring for those closest to me because its like I am a firecracker, and I want to explode, and be like HERE I AM I AM FUCKING MAGNIFICENT!   


And its also helping my relationship with my son so much. For the first 4 years of his life, I just could not bond with him. I tried doing therapy sessions with him to learn a bond, I had a family counselor come over and talk me through my extreme PPD but nothing.

Yesterday was a big test, tho. My husband was fired with zero warning. His response was to abandon dry July and drink. Old me would have joined in. But I didn't. I sat with him and we talked and planned. Drinking would have changed NOTHING. Also now we have much much less income, so why waste the money we have on a depressant in this depressing enough situation?

My advice to anyone reading this: love yourself and be careful out there. The world can be treacherous, so save your money. No matter how little you have, it's really one of your only powers.  Without it, you can't do much. Cherish your friends, and your family if you can. Take care of you because you matter.

Almost at week 3 of sobriety, I was a regular binger and sometimes the sessions went on for days, you know the type!

Just thought I'd list some benefits I've noticed here for anyone who is thinking of getting sober or struggling with day one or needs a bit of motivation. also for my own benefit too. 

- sleep : sleeping like a baby the last 5 or 6 nights, waking up much earlier and feeling actually refreshed and energised for a change.

- money : have basically only spent money on groceries and that's it, haven't saved a fortune as its early days but haven't spent needlessly on drinks and then pizzas etc when hungover.

- relationship : my relationship with my gf has improved greatly, in fact she left me which led me to joining this group and reading this naked mind (highly recommended) and then came back when she saw I was serious so we're both enjoying my sobriety together. It's awesome so far. I've also contacted several friends who I had drifted away from because of my drinking, nice to make the connections again. 

- confidence / mood : feel so much more in control of myself, this naked mind helped alot with that, helps to understand the voice telling you to drink and where it comes from and also to realise how shit alcohol actually is! Feeling very optimistic and excited for what the future holds and looking forward to these benefits growing day by day. Can't wait to see what I accomplish with all the extra brain power and energy. 

- health : I've worked out 6 days straight now, nothing too strenuous just some kettlebell work at home, when I was boozing I'd workout once a month just to get rid of the guilt. I can feel my testosterone kicking up big time, bit of a libido increase too 😉 haven't smoked any cigarettes since last time I drank and haven't eaten any junk food to help with the hangover. 

- work : I hated it the last few months and totally forgot why I do this job (teacher), now I remember again. I'm having a lot of fun and smiling interacting with the students and just enjoying it the way I used to.

Overall, I feel more like myself and I'm loving it, I love myself, I love those around me and I love you ♥

I'd like to say thanks to the ppl on here, for advice and support and recommendations too.

Anyone who's thinking about it, just get one day under your belt. Then another. You'll be feeling better after a few days and then the clouds will pass and the rainbow appears.

God bless ✌️

As I was about to pull out of my garage I ran back into my house to destroy all evidence of my crimes from the previous night. As I was cleaning up it seemed as if my cabinet had turned into a clown car as no matter how many full, half full, or empty bottles I threw away when I looked back there were still more that I had to clean up.  At this point I woke up practically in tears thinking that I had slipped the night before but slowly realized it was just a dream.

I am running lock step with my father's life-plan with so many eerie parallels, that it is almost a comedy when I check another one off the list.

I am horrifically depressed, so I drink.  That gives me a 4 hour window of some hope and pleasure.  The next morning, as consciousness creeps back in, I am more depressed than 14 hours earlier when I started the cycle.    


I'm now at the point where I am black-out drinking to the point where I need to reconstruct the previous night with clues.  I never get sloppy drunk or visibly impaired beyond maybe being a little manic and chatty, so am a ""high functioning"" alcoholic.  Haha.  Don't feel even slightly high-functioning as I am writing this.

2008,2020-07-11 09:18:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hp9tzp/saturday_runs/,Saturday Runs,"Are my favorite run. I get to take my time and focus on the distance at a comfortable pace instead of trying to push for speed. I’m blessed with being a natural born morning person which comes in handy this time of the year because by 7 am it’s already 70f and 92% humidity.  

I saw some cool things today! I saw a woman on an Eliptigo! It’s like an elliptical you *ride*. I was just listening to a podcast where an ultra marathoner trains on one and how much she likes it so it was a treat to see one in person. It looks like a blast/insanely dangerous lol   

I saw 2 packs of foxes! The first time, it was a lone foxy boi crossing the street, probably to go knock over someone’s trash can. The second time, I saw a whole group of foxy bois in the middle of a gravel road. They scattered as I approached and then suddenly they all exploded back out of the woods being chased by something small, black, and white! I was like “oh wow holy shit”. When I got to where they were, I looked in the direction everyone had run in and I saw a brown and white tabby cat sitting contentedly in the front of a yard. I stopped and shot the shit with him for a minute. “It looks like you missed, eh?” “I don’t see *you* catching any foxes, human.” “Touché, my man” and I took off again.  

It also rained a ton last night - jersey had flash flood warnings. So when my route took me over a bridge I had to stop and check out the river below which was indeed raging against the, well, river banks. It looked pretty quick too. A man was fishing, the river surface was a million splinters of sunlight reflecting off the rapidly shifting water. And off I went again.   

Towards the end I was drenched in sweat and bemoaning my decision to not bring water. Why did I think I wouldn’t need (or at least badly want lol) water on an 8 mile run in 92% humidity? I had just a half a mile to go so I put on the best song to finish a run - Anna Sun by Walk the Moon. The final half mile was all down hill (thank god lol) and I grinned enjoying the breeze from passing cars. I passed some tall privacy hedges the owner should cut back because they lean too far into the sidewalk and I saw a billion water droplets reflecting a billion small suns sticking to every tiny needle so of course I  raised an arm and smashed the bushes shaking all the water free in an impromptu much needed shower.   

The run ended just as Anna Sun did (thank god) and I walked the final block, exhausted, so so so thirsty, and likely leaving a path of stink a mile long. But man I love Saturday runs. Had I  been drinking I wouldn’t have found so much *joy*. Even if I wasn’t hung over knowing I did something that causes me (eventually if not immediately) so much pain would have robbed me of any ability to find joy in a thing like foxes being chased by a cat or a bush loaded with last nights rain.    

I hope you all have a wonderful sober Saturday. I know I will🥰

If I had been asked to assess things like depression and anxiety on a scale of 1-10, I'd likely have reported something like improvements in 1/10th's of a point.  But I kept chugging along (poor phrasing I suppose lol), doing my best to exercise and eat healthy.  I was still only managing ~3ish hours of fitful sleep a night.  I had begun to just accept that it would be a long time until I could sleep like some of you guys had reported.  

I felt fine-ish most of the day, but starting at about my normal Friday drinking hour, I was experiencing wave after wave of depression, anxiety, guilt, and shame.   Oh boy, the guilt and shame are the hardest to not run away from.  But I faced it down.  I let it run it's course.  I went for a short hike Friday evening and listened to my favorite podcast - Dan Carlin's Hardcore History.  Since it was just an addendum show,  it featured Dan interviewing Tom Hanks about his newest film ""Greyhound.""  Sounds neat!  I further distracted myself by learning to *fucking* hate trying to sign up for apple TV+ (the only platform the movie is currently available on) without an apple device.  

While all day I felt physically exhausted, it wasn't until 7:30 or so that my mind was able to entertain the idea of sleep.  Okay, great- lets give it a try.  I get into bed, and the throbbing guilt sets-in in earnest again.  Fuck.   Again I let it happen.  I think about it, and try to pick every cherry on that guilt tree that I could find to re-purpose for later.   I got comfortable, turned the a/c down low.  Tried to read... last thing I remember was the twilight from outside still coming in around the curtains (I suppose around 8:30-9PM).  Then 4AM- I need to pee.  Holy shit, I feel pretty good.  I pee, take a drink a drink of water- and pass back out (in a good way) until a little after 7 this morning.  Goddamn, do I feel so much better than yesterday.  Instead of measuring my improvements in 1/10ths of a point (which is stupidly arbitrary anyway lol), I feel whole point*s* better.  


* I'm thankful I've decided to do this for myself.  

* I'm thankful for what my now-ex (of which is the source for much of my guilt and the final straw) constantly reminded me: ""[I'm] stronger than I think.""  This has been my mantra when I feel weak or want to run away.  
* I'm thankful for my perseverance.
* I'm thankful for choosing to give loving-myself a chance.  
* I'm thankful for all the comments, books, videos, and podcasts I've read and listened to this week where I've ripped nuggets of inspiration from and used them as my own.  
* Finally for the first time in a very long time, I feel thankful for me.

It has clarified my thinking and focused my desire to stop long-term in a way that I never could have done had I been talking to myself or just talking about myself.  Who knows, maybe my thoughts helped someone, i'll never know, but I have no doubt that having a place to put my thoughts down and hear from others gave me the superpower to rise up become the person I should have been a long time ago.

Immediately after remembering my childhood, doing similar thing after parents had been drinking. The mind boggling part of it is that my mindset was behaving the same way like the time when i was a kid. Just smelling the stuff and disregarding it having no thought of consuming the stuff :)

I was daily beer drinker my entire adult life and that makes close to 20 years. Entirety of that time i did not think once that it could be problem, as far as i remember. It was more like ah, its just 2-3 beers a night, its not like i am drinking cases in a row. I was addicted to this stuff. I remember gathering i went with this one friend i had, there was no alcohol and the event lasted past the time when alcohol was allowed to be sold and hour before that time all i could think was ""fck, fck i can't make it to buy my 3 beers to actually chill home, this party sucks"".

Thankful to have no cravings at this time for this poison. Nonetheless i am armed to the teeth to handle the cravings in case they decide to pop up. "" You *pray* for *rain*, you *gotta deal* with the *mud too*"".

I am healthier- I have lost about 5kg since I stopped drinking. I fight with my wife a lot less. I'm emotionally more stable. And I'm saving money, because my alcohol consumption has been replaced for the most part by water or soda water. 

So thank you all. And to those of you who are just starting, you can do it, and there's no better time to start but today.",3,0

We weren't really together, but we had been spending a lot of time together recently. We were friends before any sort of romance, but I just wasn't feeling what I thought I should be feeling once the subject was broached, and I felt like they should know that I didn't think we should continue. I feel like an asshole, and this is normally the part where I drown my sorrows in empty self-pity and alcoholic flagellation. The social lubricant of alcohol goes in many directions, not only in letting your inhibitions subside in getting things started, but also allowing negative feelings to erupt when inebriated. I still like this person, I don't hate them, I want them to be happy, but I don't feel the headlong attraction I think I should be feeling. I don't think it's fair to them to step into something serious with a ""so-so"" demeanor and having to articulately explain that was much more difficult than just simply fucking it all up while drunk. I'm an asshole and I feel this very acutely right now, but I will not drink with you today.",13,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Saturday friends!

I'd like to take this day to thank everyone for being so great while I've been here. My first time hosting, I think, was a success, and i had such a great time interacting with you all! My only regret was that I was working so much, I didn't get a chance to respond to as many as I'd liked to!

This has been a very interesting week for me; I'm usually a thinker (perhaps a little too much sometimes!) but reading some of the responses really made me look deeper and come to conclusions I probably never would have myself. I hope I have done the same for some of you!

I know this is usually a pretty common topic for the DCI, but today I'd like to focus on gratitude and the types of things you are thankful for. I'm a firm believer in actively practicing gratitude, and I know Saturdays can be the hardest for some of us, so hopefully thinking about everything you have to be grateful for can serve as an aid on this challenging day. 

Please just remember you'll never regret *not* drinking, but also as long as you pick yourself back up after a slip (no matter how long the slip lasts) it's not really a failure, just part of the process. No matter where you are in your journey, the fact that you're here means you're better off than the people who still don't think they have an issue. Can't solve a problem you don't know/believe is there!

I told myself I wouldn't do this but this is something I am extremely grateful for - This Naked Mind by Annie Grace. I've mentioned it in a couple comments, but I really felt it was important because some lovely stranger on here casually suggested it to me at just the right time of desperation and I said 'fuck it' and just got the book. I've never been the same since, and if I can reach one singular person and do the same for them, it would mean the universe to me. If you do read it, and it has an impact on your life, I would love to hear about it 😊

Finally, if you have at least 30 days on your badge and you're interested in hosting the DCI, please dont hesitate to let me know or let u/SaintHomer know. I had such a fun time this week and I encourage you to try it out. Even if you never do it again, definitely recommend at least doing it once!

Godspeed my fellow sobernauts, it's been real! Thank you again for the support and love this week! IWNDWYT!",95,0

The best part is the freedom from a cluttered mind consumed for 30 plus years with the consumption of alcohol: getting it, drinking it, regretting it, recovering from it (repeat).

I’m close to 6 months sober and I’ve been noticing some strange things about myself recently. I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this. Figured I was just a little tired and stressed until my partner said something tonight. He couldn’t exactly put it in words but he got the message across that I seem mentally “off”.


The insomnia I experienced in early sobriety is coming back, I’m more spacey than normal and am very forgetful, I kept tripping over nothing earlier. I feel like my ability to speak is a rather diminished. Also, I’m noticing my verbal “filter” is weaker, I tell it like it is a little too much, which is not my usual personality. I’m an introverted people pleaser. We’re painting the bathroom right now and I have stuff spread all over and my partner said something about the way I was doing it wasn’t normal. I can make an excuse for any of these issues individually but the fact my partner is also noticing it makes me wonder if I’ve permanently damaged my brain.


I’ve heard from others with similar drinking habits as mine (pretty heavy and constant for 10+ years) that the sleep issues and emotional turmoil does seem to pop up again around this time. Any internet sources I’ve looked up don’t have much to say on this subject.


No matter what though, I’m not going back to drinking! I’d rather be a little clumsy, sassy and tired than what I was going through drinking. I’m amazed at how far I’ve come in six months and excited for how far I have to go! This one day at a time thing rocks and sobriety is bad ass!


Much love y’all!

Any words of advice for my first night out AF?,"Hello! I’ve just signed up for the 90 day challenge and needs some words of advice! 

I work in the yachting industry, where the lifestyle is very much work hard play harder. When there’s guests on the boat, there’s no drinking. Perfect right? But it’s the drop off days, the days between. We worked 16 hrs a day for 2 weeks, even months straight so it’s party time until next trip. Even on trip, I work in service and often make and create cocktails, pair wine with food, which I taste test. But sometimes admittedly I sneak a drink in a glass. I do love the flavour, it’s a passion to find new flavours. So that will be hard to overcome. But off charter Every day is a Saturday. Beach clubs, new bars around the world. It is a dream lifestyle but one that I need to start enjoying alcohol free and I’m really keen to try. I’ve been doing this for 8 years, and I started this trip on a 5 day binge with 2 hours sleep each night. And for the past 6 weeks previous I think it was only a Monday and Tuesday I didn’t have a drink, what else is there to do in a shipyard? The excuse was season was about to start. Alcohol is provided by the boat. So I’m not technically spending much. Things need to change, my body can’t keep up like it did when I was 21. I’ve just started a uni course online and trying to maintain a LDR. I was choosing a day at the beach bar instead of finalising my assignment when I had the time and not calling my boyfriend.
So I’m reaching out! Is any one else in the marine industry and have words of advice? It’s a crew members birthday, but that’s just another excuse. There will always be a birthday, someone you haven’t seen in a while, coming or going out of port. Only a day to let off steam before it’s back to working straight until next drop off day. Or those not in yachting who’s lifestyle is based around socialising. Help! How do I tackle my first night out EVER alcohol free?? The whole crew are so encouraging of drinking and the magnum bottles and shots are always flowing. I want to be that fun girl sober just as I am after about 4 drinks! 

Thanks so much in advance! I’m excited to take this journey with you guys🥳",7,0

I was already a little nervous about this weekend because my gf is out of town and I knew this would be a perfect opportunity to get some beers in and drink them all by myself. So I made sure to get my favourite na cider and some icecream which is perfect after a long day doing construction in southern Spain which is where I live. So I get home, open the refrigerator and there it is, staring right at me. My first thought is that maybe my gf brought it for me as a kind of cheat day treat and who was i to say no? My second thought was that I've gone two weeks without booze so i must deserve it. I cant tell you how thankful i am that my third and final thought was to close the fridge, have a cold shower, drink some water and make dinner with my lovely sparkling apple. It turns out my gf's Mother had put it there because she was given it as a present and knew I liked it. When i told her that i have stopped drinking her eyes lit up, she is also a non drinker and I could tell that she was really happy that I had made this decision. I gave her the beer back so she can give it to someone else. Last night I had some crazy drinking dreams but this morning I've woken up feeling great and looking forward to enjoying the weekend instead of depressed and hungover.

Don't get me wrong, stopping drinking is one of the best things to do, because alcohol just exacerbates all the problems i'm trying to solve by having that drink.

It impairs my judgement, i end up doing things that feed into the sense of self hatred, and the depressant nature of the drug literally ensures that my coping defences are weakened before i even start.
But i'm lucky enough not to be physically addicted to alcohol. In some ways it actually makes it harder to stop, i don't have a big flashing red warning telling me that my life is on the line if i keep going. I give myself permission because ""i'm not that bad..."" Yet.

Something in my head seeks out the feeling of freedom and relaxation alcohol gives. There is something missing in my life that i'm looking to drink to fill.
Sometimes i think that if i could just work out what that thing is and i could fix it, i might have a normal relationship with drinking again. Am I crazy? Is this another lie i'm telling myself?
Maybe stopping drinking is the very act of self care I need to practice in order to fill the void i want alcohol to fill.

This mistake ruined three people’s days, and for me it triggered a strong desire to retreat to the one thing that always helps me stop thinking about my screwups. 

I haven’t had anything to drink, but I’m lying here tossing and turning in bed, my heart racing from the anger that hits me again every time I relive and reprocess the morning’s events. I know that a quick drink is only a minute away if I wanted to go get it. 

What’s really hard is that the whole thing makes me feel profoundly stupid and inconsiderate, exactly the emotions/feelings that dominated years of my life when I was drinking to excess and prioritizing my own needs over others’. These are the feelings that make me long for a drink, and the coincidence with the desire to cut loose for this vacation is hard to fight.

I completed a 60 day rehab last April, relapsed dec 30th of last year, and entered a salvation army adult rehabilitation center in february.   I am a beneficiary right now.  It's been very challenging but also quite good.  I am sitting here a bit bored and figured I'd answer any questions about it.

My typical day monday thru friday goes as follows:

6:00 - wake up call

6:50 - morning devotions: a quick meeting with a daily reading

7:00 - breakfast

7:30 - 4:00 - work therapy mostly done in their warehouse

4:30 - dinner

5:30-7:30 - classes, a mix between addiction classes and spiritual classes

10:00 - lights out

I personally have found this program to be a big benefit for me for the most part.  The program is christ centered so most people at least respects that.  The work therapy goes to support the program, it is completely free.  I find the work part very helpful, giving me a sense of learning my stay and giving back.  There are some weaknesses in the addiction classes as well as some issues with the running of the center, but overall I think they do a good job for those in need.

2057,2020-07-10 20:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hp078g/my_experiment_day_3/,My Experiment: Day 3,"So far, I am and enjoying this new routine. I read my books in the morning, reflect on the chapter throughout the day, and journal at night. Over all I have a more positive outlook throughout the day and I hardly focus on how to avoid drinking at night. This in itself is a huge improvement for me. I've quit so many times, but never have I been this optimistic.


Today the chapter focused on why we think we like to drink. 


I started drinking (rarely) at 16. I started because I was working a shitty nanny job with six kids and both parents stayed at home. The mom would constantly tell me I was doing *it* wrong. I could never win. My dad picked me up one night, and I burst into tears. He hadn't seen my cry since I was little. Shortly after that, I had another long couple of days. I went on a multiple day road trip with them. It was hell. I got back late, didn't have to work for the next couple of days and I found whatever alcohol I could get my hands on. I felt relief. I didn't care about the last couple of days anymore. They didn't matter. That's how I started to correlate drinking with de-stressing. 


From there, I started the binge drinking in college on the weekends. I would occasionally drink while I was studying, but not excessively. I started drinking more regularly again when I became stressed at work and from there, it has snowballed. I drank after work to unwind, which in and of itself could've been okay, if I could keep it to a beer. I couldn't and still can't. 


Today, it was eye opening to read that drinking actually causes you to be more stressed out the next day and alcohol is strongly connected to depression. With that first beer, endorphins are released, but your brain tries to counter balance itself and releases dynorphin, a chemical downer. Alcohol also releases cortisol which is the stress hormone. Reflecting on all the times in the past, it makes sense why I would wake up hungover and more stressed; even if I could piece together the night and I didn't make a fool of myself. 


Overall, I had a very positive day. I spent the day making new foods I have never tried with fresh herbs and ingredients from my garden. I made: squash and mint soup, grilled chicken tacos with a strawberry and avocado salsa, and a basil, peach, tomato salad. They all turned out great and I will be making them again. I also hit all my exercise goals. I know not every day is going to go this well; but I feel much better prepared with this new routine and starting my day focusing on the positives.

2058,2020-07-10 19:44:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hozveb/introduction_and_questions/,Introduction and Questions,"I have been drinking since high school, I'm currently 34 years old. My first experience with alcohol was a blackout and continued about once or twice a month at parties and such throughout high school. Once I hit the real world it ramped up to every weekend. The hangovers were so terrible that I never drank two days in a row. In my mid twenties I started after work, but again never really two days in a row, minus camping trips, those were a free for all. It wasn't until about two or three  years ago I would drink the hangovers away, two maybe three days in a row and then work or other responsibilities would force me to deal with the pain. At that point I would put a week or more between binges because I was afraid of the pain and enjoyed not feeling like shit. About a year ago my job would have me travel for a few weeks and then have a week off. At that point I began drinking sun up to sun down on my off time, stopping only to go to the next job. Usually a week or two. A pint to two pints of vodka a day. Most days I could go until the afternoon and one would be fine, sometimes I didn't wake up hungover, but two, I would either blackout or just feel so shitty the next day, I would medicate with another pint. This past month has been all day binges, some worse than others, a few days here and there I skipped, but this has been my longest run. I had a blackout weekend with my family over the 4th and stirred up a bunch of shit. Kind of an eye opener I guess, but I knew it was coming. The whole family are alcoholics, my actions just seem to make the most effect on the people around me. I stayed two nights in a hotel because I couldn't make the trip home and ""rested up"". I limited myself to two tall boys of but light and two shooters each day and that got me well enough to make the 6hr drive home. I set a Drs appointment for yesterday, cut back to a half pint a day and planned my exit from that hell. After the doctor visit I drank my last half pint and sat on the couch and discovered and read this subreddit pretty much all night.

I know my way of drinking so much and stopping so suddenly was very dangerous. Almost every time I took a break was horrendous for days on end. This time around, putting it in my head that I'm done forever is really fucking with my head. Bringing up all the memories of the stupid shit I have done over the years, how many times I could have died. Well, I'm sure you are all familiar with these thoughts. I haven't been able to sleep. I know this is a part of the withdrawl and I'm willing to go through it. I've done it many many times. But this is really only the first time I've chose to quit. FOR GOOD. So I guess I understand that part too.

My question for everyone is if you all have any advice on how to calm your mind and just slow down a bit this early on in quitting. I know it will get better if I follow through. I'm going on three days with maybe 4hrs of sleep and don't see rest tonight. The sleep deprivation has to be compounding the physical effects and I worry about taking an otc sleep aid. I'm honestly just waiting for the crash when my body requires the sleep.

Another thing that has made things wose is that I have begin lucid dreaming of strangers in my house or hotel and I'm literally jumping out of bed to attack them only to realize I'm dreaming as soon as I start yelling. I have lucid dreams all of the time and really enjoy them, but never anything like this. Never anything that makes me want to sleep with the lights on as a grown ass man. This makes me fear falling asleep.

Any advice is welcome and I really appreciate your time. 

Since you're willing to do it for me. Today, I will begin to do it for you.

This is what worked for me.","Hello. I'm 37/M with 2 months of sobriety here. I'm on my 4th step and I'm working with a sponsor. But I'd like to take this opportunity to shine a light to anyone who is new to sobriety about what it means to join AA as a beginner.

My journey to sobriety and AA started with a lot of trial and error. I had a lot of misconceptions about the ""program"" and I had a lot of questions. My biggest burden to getting started was the mysterious aspect of AA. I felt like it was an insiders club where I didn't know where to begin, who to approach or what to say. I lament the days I felt this way because I feel it was a wasted opportunity and I felt that not a whole lot of people in AA did the due diligence of welcoming new people.

But I hope this beginners post can dispell some myths and mysteries surrounding AA.

Q: Does AA have fees or a membership sign up?
A: AA is free for anyone to join. Some groups are restricted by gender and specialties, but most groups are open to new members.

Q: Do I have to be or become a Christian to be part of AA?
A: No. You do not have to adhere to one particular religion or another. Although AA does have a spiritual component, it asks you to find your higher power as you prefer to know it, whether it's God or The Universe or Mother Earth. 

Q: What is AA anyway and what is the ""big book""?
A: AA is a fellowship of men and women who have a desire to stop drinking. The Big Book is the ""Bible"" of AA that guides you through the 12 steps and offers the essential background to living and staying sober. 

Q: How do I start the 12 steps?
A: A lot of people have different approaches to this, but the truth is that you can start any day you want. It is highly recommended that you find a sponsor who has gone through the 12 steps and who is willing to guide you.

Q: How do I find/get a sponsor?
A: You can find a sponsor through another member of AA or by attending an AA meeting. You can attend any open AA meeting in your area and raise your hand and tell the leaders that you are looking for a sponsor. That's how I found mine. I raised my hand, one of the group leaders connected me with someone he was working with and that's how I got my sponsor. 

Q: Can my sponsor be my friend?
A: Your sponsor can be your friend but it is recommended that he/she is A) the same gender as you, B) live in the same area as you, and C) has gone thru the 12 steps and has stayed sober. 

Q: What does it mean to have a sponsor? What do we do with them?
A: A sponsor is a guide, someone who has gone thru sobriety and the steps and is familiar with almost every pitfall you will encounter along the way. In my experience, I am required to call my sponsor every day, just to check in. It's usually just to let him know that I'm staying sober or to let him know if I'm struggling with something. Once a week, we meet via zoom so we can read the Big Book and work through the 12 steps. He has me write my thoughts on each of the chapters of the book and any extra prayers. 

Q: How long do the 12 steps take to complete? When can I start?
A: There is no timeline for finishing the 12 steps. Everyone takes different time to finish them. The timeline and succession of events is something for you and your sponsor to agree upon, depending on your schedules. 

Q: Once I get started, do I still have to go to meetings?
A: Some sponsors require their new sponsees to attend daily meetings for the first 90 days. But once you get the hang of the program and sobriety, you will find that attending meetings are part of what keep us sober. Sobriety takes work and it takes daily work. 

Q: How do I find a meeting? 
A: Because of the pandemic, most AA meetings are happening virtually via zoom. You can Google search AA meetings in your city or nearby metro area and you will likely find a page that lists those meetings. Most places have daily meetings happening at all hours of the day but you are certainly welcomed to join one in a different city or a different time zone. 

Q: What if I'm shy and I feel awkward approaching strangers, especially AA people?
A: Every member of AA is familiar with shame and guilt. Most meetings will usually have a group leader or a secretary that can help answer your questions. You can privately message them and ask them whatever questions you have. YOU ARE NOT A BURDEN. Get that in your head. AA members, especially the ones who have completed the 12 steps, understand that SERVICE to others is part of the program. Those who have done the 12 steps know that helping others get sober is part of our calling. This is what we do and this is how we stay sober: by helping others. 

I hope that summarizes many of the beginner questions anyone might have. Obviously there's a whole lot more that I could cover but feel free to post your questions in the comments and hopefully I or others can answer them. And if you feel like I've mischaracterized some parts or if you would like to add your experience, please share.",5,1

I've never attended any sort of AA meeting before. A court-mandated defensive driving course is the closest thing to a meeting of alcoholics I've ever attended

I've managed to stay relatively sober since May. I've had a few beers since then (to blend in w/ friends, not because I had any desire to drink) but have managed to stay sober for what has been by far the longest period in the last 2.5 years

But I want to attend meetings to reinforce my sobriety and to actually confront my issues, not just avoid them. Just a few months ago I was binging hard liquor, at least a pint a day, with almost daily hangovers. I hated myself and felt powerless to quit. I sort of had a ""rock bottom"" moment that pushed me to stop. Still, my sobriety up this point doesn't quite feel ""earned"". I just stopped drinking but haven't talked about it with anyone.

but the reason I'm making this post is because a few months ago, I (mid 30s) told my little sister (mid 20s) that i was interested in trying edibles, since she is an enjoyer of pot and I have never been high in my life. I've never really had too much of an interest growing up or during my wild 20s but i felt like it's something I wanted to understand the feeling of, at least once in my life. I live in canada and since it's been legalized i've been off and on curious.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when she gives me a small gummy and advice on how to enjoy the experience etc.. At that point no one in my family knew i was quitting drinking, so I took the gummy from her and put it in my room for safe keeping. I generally forget about its existence until I come across it, then when I see it I go ""oh right I have this. am I ever going to try it?""

I've been avoiding it for a few reasons, one is the base nervousness of.. well, never being high before. And the other is because i'm working on getting one monkey off my back and don't want to just switch it for another monkey. I'm proud of myself for stopping drinking and I don't want to find myself with another vice.

I'm sure there are people in this group with experience on both weed and problem drinking, and i'm hesitant to talk to my sister because none of my family know precisely how bad I was with drinking or my mindset on how problematic i was. So I wanted to ask you all here.

Should I try it, given everything I've said above? I think my biggest concern is the fear that I'll make a habit out of it. But I DO want to experience being high once in my life, i mean im in my mid 30s and have never smoked weed or anything.",3,0

Well I forgot about the part where I won’t be monitored for four days and nights in a row and we just did a massive liquor run the other week for our houses (again she barely drinks so basically most of what she bought- whole unopened bottles of whiskey, rum, vodka, half done tequila (bc of me) and three bottles of wine- is still here, meanwhile the $200+ worth of booze I bought has *been* done and gone).

I used to drink everyday of the week regardless, but Friday felt like a day I could justify it to myself and everybody else. Lots of excuses. It’s the end of the week - drink! I don’t have to get up for work in the morning - drink again! Let’s watch a film - drink even more and either fall asleep before the end, or be too drunk to remember it. 

Anyway, I digress. So this is my third sober weekend and it’s the strongest cravings I’ve felt yet. I’ve had a hellish week in work, coupled with trying to juggle kids back to school, and being under my feet when not (whilst trying to work full time). At lunchtime I needed to pop to the shop and I had talked myself into wine tonight. All the usual excuses. End of the week? CHECK! No work tomorrow? CHECK! Had a crappy week so deserve it? CHECK! 

I had the standard internal battle with myself as I pushed my trolley around. And then arrived at the wine aisle. I stood there and played the tape forward. I realised I’d be so angry at myself if I drank. I’d feel rubbish in the morning and it would undoubtedly open the floodgates for me drinking the whole weekend away. 

So in a moment of clarity, I grabbed a bottle of Nosecco (alcohol free prosecco), a bucketload of chocolate and biscuits, and legged out outta there. 

After work I logged off, uncorked the Nosecco, poured a big bit into my favourite wine glass, added fresh chopped strawberries and REALLY enjoyed it. Had a few more glasses with dinner and now I’m about to hop into a nice hot bath, before watching a film with my husband and actually remembering it 🙂

I made myself throw up before I passed out in order to get some of that stuff out of my system to minimize the hangover. Sexy right? This morning, I sluggishly woke up, was dehydrated, had a pounding headache, and my mood was D.A.R.K.  The negativity that I woke up with is really astounding.  As I was writing this, I had a vision of this narrative on my online dating profile and I LOL'd.  I would not date me if I saw this.  OOhhh the irony.

However, I'm not feeling horrible about my relapse, it has actually energized me.  Instead of waking up  immediately thanking God for giving me the strength to remain sober one more day, and feeling amazing, I felt like shit.  

There was no reason for me to pick up a drink and smoke last night, none.  It did nothing positive for me, it did not make me happy, the high wasn't fun.  I was well on my way to get my swagger back, skin is looking good, teeth are getting sparkly white,  I'm working out to lose the 15+ quarantine weight, and my inherent ""positivity"" had returned.  I was hearing my core happy dialogue again that told me I was amazing, I was capable and I was strong.  I was accomplishing again, meeting goals, which builds self-esteem.

Conversely, the internal alcohol fueled self talk would tell me the opposite, I was fat, loser, kill yourself.  Drinking impacted my ability to operate at my peak and I did & said stupid shit that made me feel bad about myself. If I accomplished anything, the product was subpar which just eroded my self-esteem even further.  Then of course, I would verbally abuse myself some more for being a loser.  What a cycle?!!

I'm glad the relapse happened. I see the contrast of between the beauty of sobriety and the vortex of addiction and that is a driver for me.  Each attempt at sobriety lasts longer and longer and that is a great thing.  It tells me that it is possible.  So today, I forgive myself, I will shake it off, and back to not drinking and smoking.  I gotta go back to getting my swagger back, that is really making me happy, and I'm proud of myself.

Hiding from myself wasn't easy. I had to find distractions to help me. Diving head first into projects and theories and ideas worked. Romantic validation quickly grew ineffectual because I couldn't digest the bullshit that served as the bulky fiber of my blaming others. It was me.

At one workplace I had a guru teach me the ways of the master. He combined beer and pizza with work. It was amazing. I would have followed him for much longer but he subtracted overtime wages as a former of spiritual and temporal  payment.

Surviving was and is hard. I continued to seek answers to my problems. However I had become such a master of hiding from myself I didn't realize that I could no longer identify what I was feeling. I didn't know how to describe it. I didn't even know the terms.

After decades of loyal service alcohol no longer worked. No matter how judicious I was in dosing I could no longer conceal my misery from my intended audience; that being me.

The sheer abject desperation was beyond distonic. And I found myself bereft of all hope that any distraction could alleviate my pain. 

It has taken years of writhing in hopeless emotional and physical squalor searching for anything to help me. I'm only here today because I found so many pieces strewn here and there. 

Each fragment alone was insufficient but by so many miracles when magically connected a map began to emerge from the darkness. A simple path with solid points by which to navigate.

So much work. So much heartbreak. But I think I've discovered a way to do it. To finally face my life without the need for validation or approval or permission from anyone. 

I'm being unintentioanlly misleading. What I'm trying to say is over the years I turned distractions and illusionary validation into my higher power. I had become an idolatrous and didn't even realize it.

I turned to God and sought Him to replace the empty bottles and cans and sickness and insanity of my idolatry. So simple that my sophistry blinded me to it.

This morning and every morning I have to face my truth. Distractions don't work. They don't have to. I don't need them to. I can walk my new path one day at a time. One step at a time.

Decided, nearly on a whim, to make another run at drying out on Christmas Day last year. To my happy surprise, it's stuck. I love it. One of the best choices I've ever made, seriously right up there with deciding to marry my wife. I've had a lot of spare, coherent time to think. Here's some of the stuff that I've come up with.  


Being sober won't fix your problems, that's still on you. BUT, a lot of the things that seem just so insurmountable with daily administration of a CNS depressant (alcohol) get a little less daunting once you let that go. Drunk life is absolutely life on hard mode, and it seems so,so  strange to me that I decided to live that way for so long.  


Tempted to say that my wife has the patience of Job. In truth, I think Job's patience pales by comparison to my wife's. She could and probably should have bailed on me a number of times over the years. Without even thinking hard at all I can come up with at least a handful of times where she 100% *should* have said... ""you know, clearly you're an alcoholic and I'm not putting up with this for me or my kids."" But she didn't. That is a debt and guilt combo that I have to own and live with- the relationship work required to make up for 20 years of me acting mildly to moderately a fool all the time, with occasional serious problems... is substantial. I've had to teach myself to stop apologizing to her for it every day, but I still do sometimes. She deserved better, and so did my kids, but she pointed out to me a couple weeks ago that I'm teaching the kids some intensely valuable lessons about how people can change, how there are, in fact, substance abuse tendencies in my family, and how love is powerful and can get you through some stuff you just couldn't do on your own. I couldn't do this on my own, but with her support and love I am doing it. Mostly for me, but for her and our kids, too. We're a team and I just wish I had been a better team captain- but all I can do is look ahead and do better. And so I am.  


Alcohol is cruel and stupid. It will make things seem normal that aren't, it can make you make decisions (or not) that you wouldn't have otherwise, and it's a serious impediment to our culture. I can't believe, after getting some space from it, that it's the drug that our society has said ""OK, this one... this one is OK."" It's been with us a long time, I know, but... man. The culture of substance abuse around booze, and just how normalized it is... is real weird.   


Those are lots of words. I had the idea to post something like this a day or two ago and didn't really organize well, I just let it rip. I'm sure there are more experienced folks that will pop in with their thoughts too. If you're just getting started or haven't got a week clean yet or... whatever... You can do it too. I believe in you and am here to tell you living sober is better.

The day prior, I was listening to a podcast where people were talking wistfully about traveling to Italy and enjoying the wine and I was so ANGRY that if ever I found myself in Italy the wine would be off-limits for me. This is the first time stopping has led to feelings of anger — like deep visceral anger. I'm trying to take it as a sign that my brain is recognizing this time I'm stopping for keeps.

Hope you've had a good week and are going to be strong this weekend. This marks my fifth day sober I can tell already weekends are going to be tough. Especially with everything opening back up. Going to miss the beer gardens, the brunches, dinner party's at friends and those other drinking social gatherings we've all become accustomed too. 

For me Friday has also been the typical ""date night"" but with the whole going sober I'm kind of feeling odd about dating at the moment. It's like how do you date and not drink? Also this leads me to thinking about having fun with friends without drinking. Will dancing be the same? I kind of feel like sobriety is coming with this social isolation. Keeping me away from dating and seeing certain people. I was wondering what are some of your approaches to dating sober? Do you only date others who do not drink?

Also I was wondering if you guys still go out with friends to bars, brunches, dinners even if your companions are drinkers?

And finally I was wondering has anyone ever gone from being totally out of control to a casual few drinks here and there kind of person? I'm the kind who can't stop after one and ends up on massive benders so I'm not sure that's an option to me.

I'm struggling to imagine a life I can enjoy with my friends that doesn't involve drinking or me being that one ""who doesn't"" drink. I'm guess I'm transitioning. On a more positive note it feels amazing to have woken up five days in a row with no hangover and to be once again thinking and taking a proactive approach to my life and my future.

Anyway today feels odd but I'm going to try and stay strong.",6,0

Never in my wildest dreams I thought I would ever write that- 3 years ago.

It’s 11:30pm on Friday night and just finished washing the dishes and watching Flight- movie with Denzil Washington where he is an acoholic.

Really good reminder of how it used to be for me, to be totally ‘in control’ of my life and drinking, to think that I didn’t have a problem with drinking....

But I did have a problem with drinking and will for the rest of my life, but today I am sober and tommorow I will wake up sober(with a clean kitchen).

Has been a really challenging past couple of months with COVID and work, working silly hours and just the uncertainty has been messing with my head... but I have not drunk and will not.

Last week I found out that a friend of ours past away, younger than me- I am 39. She has 3 little kids, like me and she was the nicest/happiest lady to be around. But unfortunately she took her life last week, which is just so sad.

Made me feel so sad for her and her family. Dug up a lot of mixed emotions, towards the end of my drinking I considered doing the same thing. But no nobody would know this as I never told a soul and was always that happy go lucky guy...

Not really sure where I am going with this post

But I am grateful that I am present and sober, have a loving family and made the decision to stop drinking before it was too late...

Towards the end of my drinking I was very close to losing my wife, children and no doubt my own life.

But I decided to stop (after numerous failed attempts) and it was the best decision I could make.

Alcohol is an evil substance and it takes control over your soul. I am grateful that I have managed to rid my mind, body and soul of that evil for the past 900 days and prayer that I will for another 900.

For those in early days of sobriety, keep at it and take one day at a time. It does get better and easier.

Thanks for listening and stay safe and sober.

Peace!",41,1

Nervous and afraid.,"So here’s my little story - I’ve (33f) had some alcohol issues for the better part of a decade. I used to just drink socially and I still had my shit together when not socializing. As of late, my drinking has turned into a different beast. Now, I drink as a way to self medicate my feelings of anxiety. I guess as you get older, life becomes heavier, things matter more, and you’re expected to be at a certain place in your journey. My biological clock is ticking, I’m wondering if my boyfriend is going to propose, I realized I hate my job, and I feel very much in a rut. 
Then Covid happened.
All the things I used to do were no longer an option. I couldn’t go to the gym, hang out with friends, go to the movies, even go to the office to work. I was forced to sit in my little one bedroom apartment and work from home. I started drinking out of boredom and to feel something in my otherwise menial existence. 
I let alcohol take hold and started drinking more and more. I would blackout on a Tuesday night for absolutely no reason. I would pick fights with my boyfriend over stupid things. I have become someone who I am not proud to be. I didn’t realize how bad my little addiction was until I tried to stop. 
Inpatient rehab is an option for me because I’m privileged and able to do so. I can take an extended medical leave from work, I have great health insurance, and I have supportive family and friends who will stand behind me. I’m scared of the stigma and the fact that it’s come down to this. I never ever thought I would be checking into rehab. I’m afraid. I’m ashamed. I feel so vulnerable and like a failure. Anyone been in my boat? 

TLDR- I think I’m an alcoholic and I’m going to rehab. I’m afraid and feel like a failure.",26,1

But when we break it down, it's madness. When I was a kid and even a young adult, I didn't even think about drinking at the weekend. I was so happy that Saturday and Sunday meant a break from school or work, playing video games in my PJs all morning, watching sport on the tv all day and eating a good meal with all of the family.

Why did we start associating alcohol with Friday and Saturday? And what do we actually achieve from drinking all weekend? It doesn't relax me. It might for a few hours but then I wake at 3am, anxious and full of guilt. Throw in a headache and dry mouth too!

I've got a good friend who doesn't touch the drink. Not because he's anti-drink, or because he's ever had a problem with it. He just isn't bothered. And his weekends are alwayas so interesting. He gets so much done (like he'll build playhouse for the kids, or he'll take them out to the forest for the day). I want to be my friend - and I CAN BE HIM. It's my choice to not drink.

I'm getting back to basics - this is my first Friday without a drink in...I don't actually remember. But that in itself will be a small victory for me tonight.

it's up to each and every one of us to figure out how bad we want this. Everyone has their own reasons for sobriety. I chose this life for my family and my new career path (Welding I start school in September). Every once in a while I'll have a bad day. Which is really only a bad 10 minutes of that day. I'll sit down and pay close attention to what I'm feeling and I will *Embrace The Suck* it's in these bad and dark and emotionally taxing moments that we can learn. The one thing I've learned in sobriety is simply to try. In the past being a constant boozer I didn't have time to try, or I didn't want to, it would be too hard. Now in bad moments,  good moments,  and the moments in between I acknowledge and take in what is going on in each moment.  For those struggling or those that don't feel as strong in their sobriety at the moment my only word of advice is TRY. You can do a lot with just trying.

I had an instance were I had forgotten that I have quit drinking alcohol. I forgot that I've been sober for 3 whole weeks, the longest I haven't had a drink in years. Just out of sheer habit I went to the fridge and opened a beer. 

But something strange happened. As I opened the beer something felt unfamiliar and I just remembered that I vowed I would never drink again as I opened it, and poured it down the sink. It's scary how impulses can set you back so far. Because once I would have finished the beer, i would have had another and another and by the time I knew it I would have finished a 12 pack.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning sobernauts, TGIF!

I had something already planned for this day, but something happened last night and I felt it was worth mentioning. My girlfriend and I kind of got into it and it came out that I've been making her feel like less of a person because she still drinks regularly. 

I won't go into all the nitty gritty, but needless to say I had no idea that she felt this way, much less that I was making her feel that. I felt absolutely horrible, and wondered if I had made anyone else feel like this. 

I try to remain neutral and let people do as they please, but to be honest, it does bother me seeing people I love and care about poison themselves. It especially hurts to see my girlfriend drunk. I have every right to feel however I feel, but I don't think I should put that on my loved ones and come off as 'holier than thou'. Especially when I earned the nickname 'DoodleBob' from my incoherent drunken ramblings (me hoy minoy!) and was pretty in the shits just two and a half months ago.

I have had very few occasions where I've felt worse, but I'm glad she told me how she felt. I hope to move forward and make an effort to be more conscious of how I am presenting myself around people who drink. This was a rude awakening for me, so I hope this can be a gentle nudge to some of you to remember to be respectful, even if you don't agree with someone's lifestyle. 

I think this is pretty universal, and should be taken as such, but especially when it comes to people who may still drink. And if you believe you are always very accepting, I urge you to really look inside and at least ask if it's possible you could have made someone feel judged, because I believed that too.

Maybe a bit too somber for a Friday but I really felt this was important to share. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk 😌",152,0

Anyone struggling with not sleeping once they’ve stopped drinking? Please help (it’s a long post, but I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it).","Hi all, first post for me....brand new so bare with me please. I really need some connections and help right now. 

My anxiety, shame and embarrassment are so high right now I can’t sleep. It’s 3:00am here in the west. I thankfully have no alcohol in the house so I won’t drink, but I secretly wish I had one to deal with these feelings....except, these feelings stem from using that drink to cope or stuff it all back down. Vicious and insane cycle. 

So today is day two for me. Fuck that’s so disheartening for me to write because I’ve had sooooo many day one, twos, threes, etc.. I’m starting over again. However, I’m not drunk today for the second day so I do have a small win already! 

I feel so much guilt and shame CONSTANTLY because alcohol makes me so selfish. So incredibly selfish. I literally am praying I don’t loose my husband and step daughter. He’s a saint and she’s the best kiddo in the world! I cannot express how much they mean to me. But I’m selfish and I will loose them if I don’t get on a better path. 

My issue is I sneak alcohol; that’s my jam. I will go out to the grocery store and buy it and chug it with counts of 7 throughout the day on and off until it’s gone (at my home). White Claw, wine, sometimes tequila or whiskey (sooooo gross), pretty much everything that’s not super sugary tasting and GF. 

I start to feel that amazing calm come over; that feeling of freedom and no anxiety...borderline powerful! Then I try and build off the feeling and realize I’m not frightened or anxious anymore. It’s sometimes liberating for me. So much so, I keep going and get a little too loose and start slurring my speech pattern just enough to where my husband can call me out. Typically I get tipsed up and then I’m done. Sometimes I pass out, or “put myself to bed” before it gets REALLY bad. Other times I gets bad and I wake up and think, “Holy shit! Did I finally ruin my life?”. Yes, I’ve done this in front of my kiddo when we have had her. My heart is crawling out of my chest as I write that. I feel so much guilt and so much shame for those days. Disgusting. I’m absolutely disgusting. 

My kiddo’s mother isn’t a very nice lady (I’m putting that gently) and my behavior literally is jeopardizing our entire future with her. We have joint custody, but she’s someone who’s always looking for a slip up to be vindictive. Those days I do this are like days I’m serving it up to her on a silver platter. Thankfully my little hasn’t noticed, but she’s getting older and it MUST stop. It’s not if, it’s when. 

In addition, when the hubs asks about the drinking I lie. Ugh, who does that? I don’t lie EVER and I lie all the time about alcohol. It’s the one thing i lie about. It is breaking not only my heart, but my husbands. I’m so embarrassed that I can’t be “normal” that I’ve been sacrificing our trust and foundation for a stupid drink that provides a type of feeling of relaxation. 

Is anyone else in the same boat? Do you feel shame, guilt, heartache, sadness....overall disgust? Have you struggled being honest about it? 

I was never like this. Not until 2016 when I broke my neck, back and received a minor head injury. It’s like I was rewired incorrectly.

Literally before the accident, I was able to go YEARS without drinking and was a stellar, focused person. When I left my ex, who was coincidentally a secret alcoholic, drug user, and serial cheater (yay for being naive as hell in your early 20s) I had to fight tooth and nail to get my life back on track. I had some really powerful and strong years of making myself the woman I wanted to be. I was able to overcome some very traumatic abuses and I’m still very proud of that strength I was able to regain. I even drank like a normal person, socially, never during the day, on weekends or the occasional glass of win on date nights. Currently I’m humiliated because I know how disgusting it can be to be with an alcoholic and here I am....I wouldn’t want anything to do with me if I were with me. 

After my accident, I definitely have survivors guilt. I didn’t die and should have. I should be a quadriplegic and I’m not...but I’m pissing away this gift of life because I’m scared of death now. I’m just always scared.

I’ve taken anxiety meds and they helped before my accident. Then afterwards, I was taking them with pain meds, broke those and I think I just used alcohol to replace it occasionally....now it’s spiraled. 

Recently I made the conscious decision with a doctor to stop the meds I was on for a reset and because they made me feel like I wanted to drink more. It’s been two weeks and these last two days, the last two I haven’t drank have hit me hard with guilt, but interestingly enough I think I have to deal with these feelings in order to not go back to abusing alcohol. 

Has anyone ever felt meds increase their cravings? Does anyone have any relatable advice once they’ve stopped their medication? Any helpful suggestions or stories? 

Thanks for listening. I’m just ready to be a better me again; the one I know was kept on this earth for a reason. I just kind of need a hug from other people who know what it’s like right now. 

Thank you all for your strength and stories!

I normally don't drink. If you'd count my average monthly alcohol consumption this yeah per month it would be around 2-4 drinks per month.

On Tuesday night I drank around one bottle of wine which a friend brought and gifted me, around 800ml of 11,5%(plus 1-2 shots of whiskey/rum) . I never drank so much and the wine tasted very sweet and I figured why not, I'll surely have ""no hangover"" because the last time I drank more than 2 drinks per session was like 6 months ago. I also had a terrible hangover there but forgot it. At the same day, I had also hit the gym and lifted weights.

I felt constantly like crap and didn't want to do anything. No energy and I felt extremely anxious, dizzy and fatigued - I still feel the effects now but far less than I did yesterday and the day before. It was crazy, I was constantly in a state of ""half-sleep"" where I was kind of in a dreamy state. I had to drive 120 miles and I would have skipped my appointment, but thankfully my dad drove (he wanted to come, I didn't tell him that I drank)

I'm normally a very self confident person but I was shaking and also freezing when I was in the registration office yesterday. My hands were shaking. I could not believe myself, I really could not. My emotional state is normally very stable and positive but since I drank it has become terrible. It improved, but still not great. 

I still just want to sleep and rest even at the third day (I'm sobered up since 48h, last drink was 56h ago) my bold still aches from the gym and from the alcohol as well. 

Surely many can relate? Do I have an alcohol intolerance or what? I know friends who drink way more than me and they don't report any effects. When will my negative effects from the drinking session go away completely? 

I am so pissed of at myself, it's crazy. I never want to touch that shit again.

It details my journey of sobriety. I have only shared this with one person before but I hope it touches you all and some benefit can come from it.
—————————————————————

Life is one big dream:

Instability is romantic, it is the devil in a bright red dress. She lures you in with fun and excitement before trapping you with the crushing reality of what your life has become. 

She invites you for one little dance in the moonlight. You think, “How could it hurt?” It is the truest expression of what it means to feel alive. Soon the surrounding reality vanish in an instant, all of the good along with the all of the bad, as you are freed from life’s oppressing chains once again.

Fun and thrills of one night soon becomes repetitious routines and chasing after an unattainable happiness. This is not the end however but just the beginning of the descent into madness. The only escape is to dive deeper down to the rocky bottom of the inferno, till you can no longer stand the heat, in a hope to find ones own personal salvation.

As time passed in hell a sudden yet equally random self-realization comes as a flash of lighting in the darkness. The question, “What am I doing here?” lingers this night . Tomorrow though, is a new day. With the sunrise comes new temptations and new problems which I will fall back into once again

The devil is quite good at luring wayward souls, he has existed far longer than I have. He is craftier, faster and stronger, while I am but the lowly beaten dog chasing an imaginary ball. Escape from this captivity seems to be but a fever dream at this point.

Escape from hell is not attainted from one valiant feat but from thousands of battles that no one will ever know. There will be no applause for your efforts. Each day is a battle: Temptation, craving, despair, tears, lost friends, burnt bridges, boredom, self hatred, depression, night sweats and nightmares await. All of this in hopes of winning voyage away from this dreaded land. 

-

After months of fighting across the choppy waves and voyaging through the nether once again; finally arriving at safe shores. This land seems so familiar yet so distant at the same time. 

The heart still pounds from the journey just finished and craves the thrill of being in the wind once gain. There is no solace to be found here. The thrill of the chase calls and daily monotony is less than satisfactory. 

-

As time passes in these strange lands, that I have all but forgotten, a moment occurs. This moment comes under the darkness of night, when all is silent and I am alone with my thoughts. Serenity perhaps, but a moment of clarity for now none the less.

Instability doesn’t seem so alluring; the devil can wait. 

Life’s chains of oppression loosen from around my neck even if it’s just for a fleeting moment; another dance in the moonlight can wait. 

The ascent from madness has begun; the rocky bottom is but behind me.

With the new sunrise comes my life and my responsibilities; I know what I am doing here. 

The fever has passed and I have awoken from the dream; my wayward soul wanders on from this dark place. 

The solace to be found here is in inner peace, my heart now fears to be taken with the wind of uncertainty towards distant shores. 

This is but a singular moment of serenity in the night time perhaps, but I will enjoy this moment for now and come forward tomorrow a stronger man.",2,0

I know I need to just go with the flow, be kind to myself, understand my body needs to deal with one thing at a time but I’m slightly worried I may be swapping one addiction for another! It’s actually dawned on me, or at least I now remember, before I started drinking heavily in my early 20’s I did completely obsess and overindulge in sugar but at the time I was popping pills and amphetamine like smarties and sherbet dib dabs so weight gain was never an issue. 

On the plus side, I’m so in love with the fact that I now look forward to climbing into bed on a night. I think it might be my favourite part of the day! I’m fresh, clean and know I’ll fall asleep naturally - only 12 days in, its total bliss. But my dreams are sooooo busy (I never stop running around chasing stuff in them). They’re so vivid and clear, I wake up initially feeling exhausted.

They took her away in the ambulance and were only gone a few minutes before the officer on the scene took a call and informed us that she had been pronounced dead.

She showed up at my front door on Thanksgiving to take me to rehab after I relapsed and went on a week long black out bender.

I’ve been lurking for a couple of months (using a different account) and wanted to post, as this community is really encouraging and I have been excited reading others posts about their stories and how life without alcohol is possible and worth it!

47 days has been the longest I have ever been sober in my adult life and it feels crazy to have not had any booze for this long.

Ever since I turned 21, I have been fascinated and honestly obsessed with craft beer and good whiskey. I got a job at a brewery, home brewed, and got involved in beer trading group. I didn’t realize for a long time how much alcohol consumed my life and how much my life revolved around it. I had good intentions with pursuing knowledge and trying different beers and things, but I finally (8 years later) realized that I just cannot moderate with alcohol. I never considered myself to be an alcoholic, but always struggled with just having one or two drinks.

I got a DUI at 22, but kept drinking anyways and made it a point to try to just drink at home if I was having more than a couple. Almost all of my social life revolved around drinking and it just felt normal to drink with friends too.

There were way too many Monday mornings at work that I was hungover and felt so much guilt for not being able to give my all. My ex-girlfriends had pointed out that my drinking was problematic, but I never acknowledged that. Beer was my hobby and far be it from me to let someone tell me that I couldn’t control myself with alcohol or that I drank too much. I can’t believe that I was in denial for so long. It felt like I was living a double life too, being so involved at church and claiming that I was living a life for Christ. What a joke. Also, every time I drank too much, I just felt defeated the next day thinking that things would never improve. I was on the fence about not drinking for so long and am so glad I made the decision to go sober.

I felt really convicted in May to just stop drinking. I’m done poisoning my body and negatively impacting others. Enough is enough.

I’m so grateful for my family and my girlfriend who have been really supportive. I will never take them for granted.

I have been trying to pursue other things like hockey and getting out to ride my bike for exercise in place of alcohol. Sparkling waters have also been really nice to pound every night instead of 4+ beers or whiskey. 

Please let me know what has been helpful in your experiences. I’m all ears for suggestions :)

Especially with my most recent ex. Embarrassing myself at that Friendsgiving party, fighting with him about who-knows-what on the way back to his house, and then getting the fucking cops called on me because I was acting crazy and refused to leave my car at his house is insane. I don’t know why he kept dating me. I guess because I went into that outpatient program. We should have stayed broken up. I would have worked on myself more without having him as a distraction. I would have done more of the reflecting and processing that I’m doing now. We could have had a solid shot at a healthy relationship.

I lost myself in him and our relationship. I was broken and lost to begin with, trying to love and be loved by someone else. We got back together too soon, I didn’t do any work on myself and I relapsed after 2 months. I fucked it up more than I did the first time. I said I cheated on him and that fucking crushed him. I said it because I was drunk and angry at him. I texted it to him while laying in bed alone, about to pass out for the night. When I woke up in the morning and looked at my phone, I knew it was over. I went too far. And it WAS over. For 2 weeks. For 2 weeks I cried every fucking day. I made it sober the first week, but I broke down and drank on the 7th day because I just wanted to stop feeling, stop crying. I started sobriety over the next day, I  journaled, worked out, cleaned, called my parents and friends, anything that kept me busy. A week later, I got the idea to try to contact him with a different phone number. I got an app that let me change my number and I called him. Crazy, I know. He texted me and we texted all day. 

It was still too soon for us to even think about getting back together. Even more damage was done this time and it all just kept compounding. We were both hurt, angry, and resentful. We were both on edge about when the other person was going to freak out or jump down our throat. We needed to process our break up, separately, in our own time. We needed time apart but we loved each other and couldn’t actually do it. The fights, anger, hurt, and resentment continued. Until yesterday.

There is no getting back together in the future now. It is done. The damage is too much now. 

I think I’m finally realizing why they say you should be sober for a while before trying to date. I can’t give my all to someone when I haven’t even given it to myself. I am on my longest sober streak in years and I feel SO committed to my sobriety, even though its been really hard feeling all these emotions that I would usually drink away. To others that are struggling with breakups and sobriety, I feel your pain, and we can get through this. <3",32,0

Higher Power?,"I’m reading this great book about souls and in this one section the author gives some insight on our guides. “When seeking guidance, I suggest requesting help with just the next step in your life. When you do this, be prepared for unexpected possibilities. Have the faith and humility to open yourself up to a variety of paths toward solutions.”

I’ve explained this in interviews and when people ask me about my higher power. I was laying on my hospital bed, which was itchy starchy sheets on top of a plastic foam mattress😫 My leg was on fire. I couldn’t understand why it felt like ants crawling from my toes to my knee. It felt like a lighter had been traced all over my leg. I needed to google this- but my charger to my phone had dropped behind my bed, I had it locked around the side rail but it must have gotten loose. At this point I was paralyzed on my left side. I had to use all my strength to roll my body over to the left side and try to reach with my right arm. I could see it, but I couldn’t reach it. It was about 2am and I knew the nurses wouldn’t be happy with me calling them in for my charger. I kept rolling and trying to use my only leg that worked to push me up further in the bed. I was getting sweaty and my ponytail had fallen out. I only had one hand that worked, so I’d have to wait until morning for someone to help get my hair tied back. I looked up at the clock and I had been at this for 45 minutes. My leg was on fire, I couldn’t feel one of them, which is the wackiest sensation. Finally, I decided to just give up and go to bed. And then I felt like I needed to pee. At this point they were still carrying me to the commode (I had a fear of peeing in a bed pan) So I rang for the nurses. I waited. I rang them again. I waited. It was 25 minutes that had gone by and no nurse. I had to pee so bad. It was getting painful how bad I had to pee. I thought if I could call on my phone I could get their attention, but my phone was dead. I peed myself. I couldn’t hold it anymore. I started crying. I was laying in a hospital bed unable to sit up and grab my charger, I couldn’t fix my hair out of my face, my body was on fire and I just pissed myself. I had so much pity I didn’t know what to do and I just cried and cried. That was it. I got to my lowest point in life I could ever think of. I called up to God, my grandfather, my great grandmother, my brother (all my deceased relatives I’ve always called to) and I begged them for help. I promised to do anything and everything to make up for this. I would never drink alcohol again, I would do everything in my power to help others, I would donate money to the homeless and I would be a good person. “Please help me” I cried over and over. I knew I caused my paralysis from the multiorgan failure from my alcoholism, but I was 1 month sober. Please have mercy on me and help me. What is my next step? 

My roommate woke up. She called the nurses from her call button. She she spoke with me while I waited. She said I was strong. She told me I was young and getting healthier now that I wasn’t drinking. She reminded me I had children to be strong for. She kept talking until the nurse came in. The nurse cleaned me up and put my phone on the charger.  I fell asleep. The next morning, my roommate was being wheeled out to group (I wasn’t in a rehab for alcoholism, it was a physical rehab for paralyzed and stroke patients) I looked up and she had no legs. No fucking legs. She stayed awake with me all night giving me courage and talking about the future and she had no legs. I never saw her again. To this day whenever I ask my family if they remember that roommate I had at the beginning of my hospitalization, no one remembers her; I remember her💜 I don’t know if she was an angel, I don’t know if when I asked for guidance they sent her to me😇 I was still fighting my body with all the medicine they had me on and sometimes I didn’t know what was going on, but I remember her. She gave me hope, she taught me to be strong and keep pushing. All the therapists and doctors said it was a miracle. They weren’t sure if I would ever walk again and 1 month later I was being discharged with a walker. 

When we least expect it, our guides are there for us. When we can’t take it any longer we need to call on them. They don’t always give us the answer, but they guide us along in our path. Even in our darkest times, there is a glimmer of hope. I wish for anyone struggling right now to find that hope and keep pushing💙",13,0

I was so embarrassed about how drunk I got that night and when I told her today, she said that she had been very drunk as well and not really remembered the night. I had created this story in my head that I was embarrassing to be around and she was angry at me for being so drunk. But in reality we were both really drunk!

Just goes to show how alcohol affects everyone differently. I told her about how I wasn’t drinking and we just chatted about it completely normally. No huge explanations and she completely understood where I was coming from with the anxiety.

I was so glad to see her and talk to her. Been feeling a bit burnt out with alcohol recovery stuff lately, and this has really just re-lit the flame for me.

I enjoy cooking a lot.  Lots of recipes require wine or beer in the cooking, which isn't a bad thing, but I truly cannot keep wine in the house so it is dangerous for me succumb to the thought of, ""Oh, it's okay for me to buy this because it is for a recipe."" Maybe some day, but I know right now I simply can't because I WILL polish off that bottle. 

Anyway, for my fellow cooks, I thought it would be nice to share what I've been doing when a recipe calls for alcohol. The main thing to understand is that wine adds acidity and sweetness. This means that just about any time a recipe calls for wine, some type of vinegar will do. Wine also adds liquid, so even if you only have water in the house, it will do. Not all of these are always 1:1 substitutions, so do to taste. Always make sure the final amount of liquid remains the same (so if a recipe calls for a cup of white wine, just make sure you end up with a cup of liquid). 

White wine: Apple cider vinegar. This is one of my latest go-tos for substitution because it is cheap and something I have in the pantry anyway. Sometimes I will dilute the ACV with water. Ginger ale is also great, though in that case I might add a small squeeze of lemon juice. White wine and champagne vinegar also do the job, though they tend to be more expensive and less easy to find. 

Red wine: Balsamic vinegar with a dash of dark-brown sugar (maybe a couple of tablespoons of sugar). Balsamic is another thing I tend to have on hand anyway, so it's easy. I have also been known to put a little bit of beef bullion for a savory sauce/stock. Works great in a pasta sauce. 

Beer: Beef bullion or fish sauce. I frankly love fish sauce in place of beer. Note it will not be a 1:1 substitution and fish sauce is STRONG so start with a tablespoon and build out from there using water to make up for the liquid. Fish sauce is great because it is a product of fermentation so brings that umami that beer is meant to do. Some diluted coffee is also great because it brings that hint of bitterness that beer offers.  

I am still working out baking substitutes, especially when things call for bourbon, amaretto, etc. These are sweeter and definitely need to be approached with caution because baking is more of a precise science than cooking a sauce. 

Anyway, these are some of the substitutions I have been using when I cook. It's worth noting that wine was used originally because it was whatever the cook had on hand or they had some left in their bottle/it was going off and didn't want to waste anything. You better believe a cook who didn't have it would have just used whatever else did the job of adding liquid and acidity.

Quick backstory: I was in an elite PhD program, and some terrible things happened to me, and I started not performing as well. One of my advisors told me that he no longer believed that I had the dissertation “in me” and that I should teach high school. I essentially ghosted them and more or less dropped out of the program even though I only had my dissertation left to earn my PhD. I continued to drink every day for a couple years after that.

I quit drinking about two and a half years ago. It was transformative for me (lost weight, etc.). I decided I wanted to finish my PhD. I flew across the country to campus to make the case in person that I should be re-admitted to the program. I got new advisors and worked my ass off for eighteen months. I was very lucky that my new advisors were 1000% better than my old advisors. 

Yesterday... I submitted my dissertation. 

On top of it all, I was offered an academic job at a university.

This process has been difficult, but I’m so proud of myself. I believe discipline is a muscle, not an innate quality. Stopping drinking, with the help of this community, helped me to develop the ability to sit with my pain and my fear — and a will to overcome them.

Looking back it’s alarming how long I’ve known and didn’t do anything about it bc I kept “getting away with it”. Yeah sure. Only four relationships down the drain bc of my drinking, friends dropping hints, people making snide comments, me wondering where so much of my money has gone, waking up at 4am w my heart pounding so hard I thought “this was it” this time; all of that getting canceled out bc a handful of people I duped (who are also problem drinkers bc let’s be real, that’s who I intentionally surround myself with) and the general public I serve who are strangers, would say “you seem to drink in moderation” or “you’re fine, so you blacked out, just be more careful next time. It happens to the best of us”. 

I thought I was being sneaky but really looking back, people knew. I am “the drunk one” out of the friend groups or parties. I’m the one that after our hang out at the bar ends I pretend like I’m gonna hang back “to finish this one (bc I ordered yet *another* one while everyone was clearly on their last one) and then catch an Uber, you go ahead tho I’ll be fine”. They knew. They knew that I was really going to have another few rounds of a shot/beer combo til I black out and find my way home with Chinese food and wake up on the couch fully clothed. Sometimes shoes still on. 

It hasn’t even been a week yet and all my memories (the ones I can remember) are all flooding in with giant waving flags of crimson, exclaiming to me that this is it, this is the real deal. You HAVE to stop. No more breaks. 

I’ll be 34 in October. Anyone have ideas or words of encouragement from their first dry birthday? 

Much love. IWNDWYT",1,0

However, while I began to give up drinking I was still taking edibles 1-2 times a week. Which honestly really helped me get through the initial fear and shock of the world's sudden drastic shift. However, since mid-June I have given up weed. I used to smoke every day, though for the past few years I've been more around once(sometimes twice) a week. I thought I had a good relationship with weed but abstaining for almost a month has gotten me questioning if I should give it up entirely. I know AA would say yes, but I'm not sure that's the route I want to go. I also don't want to allow it to become what alcohol has been for me though. I've been super stressed and depressed this month too and to be honest all I wanted to do yesterday was take a dropper and relax in bed. Part of me is like yikes maybe that's an addiction, but also it is stress relief. I'm sorry if this isn't allowed. I'm wondering if anyone has advice for giving up alcohol but keeping a minimized amount of other substances? Can it be useful or is it just harmful? I'm thinking of keeping weed as a once a month thing potentially, but also I have a bit of an all or nothing attitude so that kind of complicates things.",4,1

Through college I was the guy that didn't drink. I'm not sure when that changed, but I realized it definitely had when my then girlfriend's father came over for dinner and said ""I thought you didn't drink?"" with a surprised look - likely because I'd poured a second drink. In 2008 I started a job that would eventually turn very mentally abusive, though I stuck with it until 2016 I definitely drank progressively more and more often to help with the bad days (spoiler - they were all bad days). Compounded with clinical depression, self medicating with alcohol was a slipper slope. When I broke up with my GF in 2009, one of the lasting things she said to me after the breakup was she was starting to get concerned about how much I was drinking.  After several months alone, with no one to call me out for drinking alone, I met the woman that is now my wife of 7 years. I won't bore you with the in-between details but I will say my drinking progressively increased over the last 10 years to the point of a severe addiction.

There was always an excuse, my wife hoping I'd stop after I got a new job. I didn't. Then we were having problems having a child which went on for years and cost us tens of thousands, so I drank to ease that pain and forget the money lost. She hoped I'd stop when we finally got pregnant - I did two full months sober, then rewarded myself with a drink on my birthday. That was two years ago, and up until a few weeks ago there hasn't been more than one day in a row without a drink. My son is over a year old now and is really starting to notice the things and people around him. If I can't do it for myself or my wife I need to do it for him.Over the last two years I've been drinking on average 3.5 litres of 47% dark rum per week. My wife would give me a hard time if I drank on weekdays (Mon-Thur, because the weekend is 3 days long right?) so I would hide it in a drawer next to my computer. It was easier because my office is in the basement, so I'd just buy an extra bottle, or two, for the cabinet, and the rest for the kitchen where it could be seen ""how little I was drinking"". I have tried with little success over the years to cut down or all out stop. My wife decided she didn't enjoy drinking anymore years ago, so hasn't had a drink in over 4 years - if only we all had her self control.

In the past ten years, there was only one month in 2012 where I didn't drink to see if I could still stop, then the 2 months in 2018. I tried again a few weeks ago and lasted 11 (migraine filled) days before convincing myself, and my wife, that ciders weren't as bad as rum so I could grab some to have in the evenings and it's not bad. The following weekend I bought the same (12) ciders, as well as 2.25 litres of rum to see if I could make it last the summer. The rum was gone by Monday evening. There was a time that 4 tall cans of cider (6-7%) would have me quite drunk for an evening. Tuesday I had 5 and actually questioned to myself if my wife had switched out my glass somehow because I was not even tipsy. I decided yesterday after reading a lot of your posts that I was done. Of course, because I'm an idiot, I had to drink the last 5 ciders so there wouldn't be any alcohol in the house.

So today is my day 1. I don't know where to go from here. Any time that I've tried to quit before I've felt like nothing has meaning, and I don't take joy in anything I do. I read all the posts about people loving sobriety and feeling great but I've never gotten there. Maybe I have to go for longer before those feelings start. I hope so, at this rate I'll drink myself to death if I don't stop. I'm hoping getting my story on here and not a secret will help to keep me accountable.

It's worth a try.Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT.",38,0

Last night I consumed about 8oz of vodka in a 2 hr window of time and at the peak of drunkenness I admitted to my partner that I would like to try to quit drinking.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were very receptive to the idea. I suggested that we place a bet to see who can go the longest. The first one to drink will pay the other $100. I know that this isn't a long term plan but, I'm hoping that we will both feel motivated by competition to get through the first few days.  I want us both to have a better life and hopefully this will help to push us in the right direction.

Trying Drugs out... and in 2018 it happend. i begun to drink every day. Not much, but every day. ""no beer before four""(Kein Bier vor Vier). But after a while i said: Fuck it, if i want to ill drink when i want to...long story short, i became alcoholic and my body begun to fall. My pain i had before baceme worser. My Panicattacks which i could handle before, would let me believe, i will die this time.   


But in the mids of 2019 i had very good times and decided to quit with all, because i was happy... and after 3, or 4 Days it was good, i had no problems to quit with all. No withdraws, nothing. Sure it was sometimes not easy to say:""Sorry, i dont want to"" when i was at a party, or a bar, but these days exist.  
However. February 2020 and shit start again. My Depression hits again, really stupid stuff happend and first i started smoking again...Then drinking... and after just one month i was back on daily drinking habbit.   


Since juni, i try to quit, but just after two days i feel so bad and have the urge to drink, otherwise ""ill die"" my body says and i ll go back to drinking...  


TLDR;

What im trying to say.... it was (for me) easier to quit, when life was balanced, when everything is fine.

He used to make wine and drank far too much of it.

Luckily, ""nothing bad happened"" and the day drinking turned to microwaved dinner in front of the TV- no being ridiculous in public or saying mean things to anyone or needing to be taken care of.

But, both morning afters have been absolutely dreadful. The feeling of needing to crawl out of my skin to get away from myself is ominous. The work I've put into sobriety since November feels like it was all for nothing. I feel ashamed and embarrassed and weak. Today is not my first day 1, and I wish I could 100% say that it would be my last, but I can't. What I can say is that I'm not going to drink alcohol today. I can say that I'm going to tell the rocks in my life that I'm grateful for them. I'm going to do my job really well today. I'm going to tell my partner that I will continue to fight the good fight. I'm not going to compare my journey to others'. I'm going to compare my journey to my journey, and I've come a long way. I'm going to feel proud about that today. 

&#x200B;

I had a conversation with the friend that I'm staying with and told her that she's been the friend that I wanted, but not the friend that I need. It's nice to spend time with her and know that she won't judge me, that she fully supports letting my hair down and having fun in whatever way that looks like for me. She reassures me in the morning that she still loves me and that nothing bad happened. She gives me permission to break the rules I set for myself. When I'm with her, I feel free of my perfectionist self. ""perfection is overrated"" she says. And I agree, though I still work every day to achieve it. 

&#x200B;

Though what I didn't realize until this morning was that I make rules for a reason. It's because following my rules keeps me happy. They help me make progress towards goals and ensure that I treat people the way I want. My not drinking rule eliminates suicidal thoughts, and deep, explainable sadness. It helps me avoid unnecessary anxiety and allows me to be fully present in my interactions. It makes me a boss who advocates for her employees, and someone who advocates for anti-racist practices in the work place. It supports honesty instead of sneakiness and light instead of dark. I told my friend that I want her to be a friend that helps me stay accountable to my goals because those goals make me happy. Breaking my rules sounds fun, but in reality it makes me sad. She listened. She heard me. She agrees that alcohol shouldn't even be a choice I say yes or no to. She doesn't like seeing me out of control, but worse she doesn't like seeing someone she loves beat herself up again and again. She decided she wants to help me be happy instead of giving me ""permission"" to let loose. I feel really relieved that we had that conversation, and that she's willing to hold my hand through my journey. 

&#x200B;

I've picked myself up off the sad hungover floor multiple times, and today I'm doing it again. I'm giving myself permission to celebrate the 187 out of 190 days of 2020 that I was sober and happy and clear-headed.

She came to the living room and I showed her that she could watch a lot of her favorite shows there instead of trying to find them on YouTube.

I lie down on the couch to watch it too. After a few minutes, she turns and it’s as if she just noticed that I was still there. Then she says “You’re hanging out with me? I thought only daddy liked hanging out with me.” She looked like she was about to cry.

My heart broke. My kid genuinely thought I didn’t like her, or enjoyed spending time with her. Then I thought about my nights before I quit. The moment I got home from work, I went straight to my bedroom to fix a drink (I hid my liquor in my closet). I spent every night in my bedroom, drinking, only coming out to get more ice or to go smoke a cigarette outside. I spent the minimum amount of time with my kids before I ran back to my room to get another drink. All that time, my kid didn’t know that I was running to the alcohol. She thought I was running away from her.

I have had anxiety for years and also have been in therapy for years. Atm my therapist is unavailable fpr the next 6 weeks. I have prescribed lorazepam. And im still figuring out what being sober means to me since i was/am a poly-addict. So i havent had any meds (apart from my sleeping aid)

Im rly anxious but i have to get some stuff done that includes me leaving my house and other anxiety inducing stuff. I know i could get it done 70%  w/o any lorazepam but only 70% and i will have at least one panic attack and i  wont have a good time doing it. I know me hesistating to take the benzo might be enough of a ""sign"" that i shouldnt take it? But i would just take it to be a little less anxious and maybe prevent an anxiety attack. (But then again that was my excuse for drinking sometimes, which didnt work lol)
But ""other ppl"" can just be *not anxious* w/o taking anything and tbh its quite exhausting and i just wanna do stuff and enjoy myslef w/o my heart pounding, sweating and hyperventilating -.- idk. I guess i will be very proud if i can do this w/o the benzo. And one of the reasons i wanna stay/get sober is to deal w my shit w/o and drugs(tm) and yes. I wont get to that point if i keep relying on benzos?(for example). but maybe thats also a little ableist? To just expect myslef to function like any other ""normal"" human being?

Idk i think i just needed to get that out appreciate any words of courage or comment etc. I think i will leave now-ish even tho i am 200% anxious and take 1 lorazepam w me if i get an attack and i cant handle it (whenever i do that i end up not needing it).

Edit: typo (not all of them tho) and i will do another coping skill i have (spicy chewing gum)

I am well past the point where I’ve been sober longer than I drank and that was certainly a more profound milestone.  As was 90 days.  90 days was hard.  In the beginning 90 days was impossible,  A week was so good I had to pat myself on the back with a six pack.  I made getting sober a lot harder than it had to be.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning everyone! 

A bit of reflection this morning, as usual. Not too long ago I had to get a tooth pulled, and my dad had to give me a ride home. I didn't need to go under or anything, so I was about my wits. We were chatting for a bit before he got serious and said 'You know, you can't have anything to drink on the antibiotics they gave you...' I was a smidge offended, because he said it the way you'd tell a child they can't bring their favorite toy to the dinner table. Instead of letting this get to me, I politely responded 'That won't be a problem. I actually haven't drank anything for about a week or two now.'

Watching his reaction was definitely a highlight for me, especially because most of my family are heavy drinkers, including my dad, and I was still often the one needing to be 'babysat'. I went home with a huge smile on my face, despite the missing tooth. That day definitely sticks out to me as one my my 'small victories'. I've added this memory to my 'mental toolkit' so whenever I need a little pick-me-up, i think back to that moment. I'd like to see some of your memories that have helped you through the process and remind you why you're on this journey.",98,0

I'm in my early 50s, and I'm committed to sobriety this time (starting day 5), but I'm getting scared that I caught it too late. I saw the doc in November last year and they ran blood tests. He said you're ok, but some of the counts were quite high. He wanted me to stop drinking and come back for another round of tests before Christmas. Did I do either of these things? No. Did I stop after the New Year? No. This is after YEARS of drinking heavily.

On the family side, I'm messing up some of those relationships as well. I was supposed to go to my mom's place this weekend where my uncle, who I haven't seen in years but would love to, will be a guest for a few days (he lives a long way away). My sister is driving 15 hours to stay at the same time. Uncle is a doctor. But I had a falling accident recently and have nasty visible bruises that I don't want any of them to see and comment/be worried about. Mom keeps asking and asking me to come up. I've just told her that I have things to do next week that I can't change. I know she wonders ""what things"" but she never says anything. Also, I'm embarrassed that I haven't worked in quite a while and don't want to have that discussion either. I wonder if my uncle will be like ""I came all this way, he's not working, and won't make the trip""?

Drinking has also caused me dental issues, and my mom's husband is a retired dentist. Geez. 

My kids (adults) don't like it when I drink and it's hurt those relationships.

Thankfully my finances are in order for now, but I've been SO unproductive.

I keep telling myself that I know NOTHING will get better with any of this until I'm sober, so I gotta fix that first. And I'm 100% committed to that.

Man- I'm feeling like such a fuckup. What a total waste. I have really messed this up.

Sorry for the rant. Thanks for reading.",5,0

I had just under three weeks of sobriety under my belt and was feeling fantastic, I was sleeping better, exercising more, and generally being a more patient and compassionate person.

My parents dropped by some stuff at the weekend, including a bottle of wine. I told them I wasn't drinking any more, but they didn't know the extent of my drinking previously so to them it must have seemed I was on a bit of a health kick. Two mistakes here I identified:

1. Not being honest with them and accepting the bottle out of politeness
2. Not pouring it away immediately after they left

The bottle actually sat in my cupboard unopened for an entire day. I can't even tell you the amount of times I thought about it, but every time in my head I was like: ""you're strong, you've got this, just leave it there for someone else"". The whole afternoon was agony, the scenarios of not drinking vs drinking playing out in my head. Soon i forgot the reasons why I had quit and drank it. I could see the whole thing playing out in my head; It was a very surreal experience.

I went to to the shop and got another bottle, went to bed feeling sick and bloated, I wasn't having any fun at all. The hangover was moderate, but there and then I swore to myself that it was just a one day slip, badge reset and back at it. Evening comes and I drink again, no hesitation this time, straight to the shop for beers and junk food.

The hangover was worse the next day, and I even had to give an important presentation at work. I was so prepared for it last week in my sober clear thoughts, but made a bit of a mess in my hungover state. I had the thoughts again for the third night, I was a whisker away from getting my shoes on and going to the shop, but i resisted! 

So grateful to wake up today without a hangover, to use this as a learning experience and to make the right decisions next time. I will not drink today :)",18,0

Both my parents were addicts growing up. Mom did crack  for several years before kicking that habit. My father on the other hand loved his alcohol. He’d go through bottles of jameson at home and that’s not counting the work lunches and bar hopping on the weekend. It made him mean, irrational and he only cared about himself. He was very emotionally abusive and the alcohol made it worse. I moved out and was basically no contact with him because of his alcohol dependency. Fast forward a few years and I am living in another state. My sibling who still lived with my father tells me he’s stopped drinking. I shrug it off because I figure it will last a week; a month TOPS. I make the decision to reach out one final time to all friends and family I care about that I may lose relationships with just to say that I at least tried. To my surprise my father is still sober. 5 months at this point to be exact. He sounds great. He’s asking how I AM and is genuinely interested in my daily life. He flies me out to his house and we reconnect. We go out to eat, go to museums, see a concert (this was pre-pandemic). It’s the father I remember, the one who introduced me to great music, great literature and film. We’re having discussions and he’s not slurring or falling asleep while I’m trying to talk to him. He tells me how much money he’s saving now that he stopped drinking (a little over $1,000 a month~ $12,000+ annually) and how he’s lost weight. Other family members are reaching out to him and welcoming him with open arms. I’m just posting this here because although it’s EXTREMELY hard to put down the bottle, it is so worth it. The mental and physical benefits alone are staggering. Dad, if you happen to read this, I know I tell you all the time now, but I am so fucking proud of you. So, with that, go to the meetings, find new hobbies, talk about how you’re feeling. One day at a time.",87,1

It was beginning to get better after 30 days sober, but I had a bad day and I broke, because my subconscious knows that alcohol will temporarily remove the anxiety. And it did, for a few hours. 

I know that I have anxiety because I drink. I don't want a temporary easing, I want to eliminate the root cause of it. It's Day 1 again, I'm still here, and I Will Not Drink With You Today. Thanks for being such a fantastic community.",10,0

Speaking of my dad and I, both alcoholics. Sometimes we confide in eachother about when we fall off the wagon. He recently asked me not to tell anyone, namely his sister I am sure, about when he slips up. He says it just makes things difficult for him. Thing is, last month, he ended up in the hospital for a siezure because he forgot to take his meds (possibly because he had been drinking?). Well, luckliy they said he wasn't detoxing while he was there, which means he hadn't gone too far down the rabbit hole... Still, his sister found wine bottles in his trash, and he had told me he slipped up at a neighborhood party. I get it, it's understandable, and the last thing I would do is judge him for slipping up. 
The thing is, when I told him I slipped up the other day, he was supportive, nonjudgemental and all that. But, he did say something that was a red flag. He told me to stay away from the hard stuff, that's what will get ya, a little wine is okay. And then he told me sometimes he has just a little wine when he is in too much pain (he has many pain issues related to Lyme's disease and back issues). This is also when he told me he doesn't tell anyone when I tell him I slip up and would appreciate it if I didn't tell anyone about when he slips up. I don't care about hiding when I mess up particularly, so that is a non issue. I AM however concerned that he is going to forget his medication, or the alc0hol will react with his meds, or he just goes too far down the rabbit hole and gains a dependency on alcohol again. At the same time, I don't want to creat more.problems for him, or create a problem where there isn't one...I am legit afraid he is going to die as a result of alcohol. He has been to rehab twice in my adult life.
 And I can't go visit him because of COVID. I offered to go down there, mask up, even stay at a hotel, but he said not now... I am pretty frustrated and don't know if I should take the gentle road of nonaction, or if i should be honest  with his sister and hope that she could be of some help.  Meanwhile, I am on day 5 or so of my sobriety... loving being sober. I have to admit it, I am scared I will mess up on a month or so and have to grapple with the anxiety and depression that comes after a night of drinking.

But they’re all so great and when I feel like I’m sharing “first class world” problems compared to their shares, they’re so sweet and supportive. It’s 100% changed my views on addicts and I know my family and mostly former friends who walked away when I admitted to a drinking problem have some skewed perception of what alcoholics and addicts look like. Over the weekend at a family garage sale I was told to not compare myself to “them” but “them” are the ones who understand. So I got the idea to pen my thoughts as I go through treatment about the process and my past as I feel led to change the perception of addiction and substance abuse. If y’all don’t mind reading, here is what I have so far. Thanks in advance. My working title is The Sober Socialite since nobody expects a middle class person to suffer from addiction.

Prologue:
Let me preface by saying I’m NOT a socialite. Middle class would be a generous statement. I’m a white female first generation college grad who managed to get out of a small factory town in Ohio, find a good career in insurance and a decent understanding of the world outside of a blue collar lifestyle. I was brought up in a church and I’m a God fearing woman, although I should’ve been hit by lightning more times than I’m proud to admit. I wasn’t raised around addiction or alcoholism, I had just heard tell of great uncles, my grandpa and my dad. I own a house, have the perfect dog, I garden, have a small side international business and a savings account, do CrossFit, my 2017 SUV is paid off. I have the degree and the mountain of student loans to go along with it. I go on lots of business trips all over the country, even once to St. Croix. I get wined and dined by work attorneys with open invitations to stay with them in places like Fort Lauderdale, the Keys, New Orleans and more. I  have a Delta Platnum Amex AND a corporate credit card with an insane credit limit. A modern version of the American Dream, amiright?

I also have a problem with alcohol.  *tires screech* Say whaaaa? Yup, a drankin’ problem. I like to hit the hooch. Can I have a social drink? Yes. Can I overly social drink? Affirmative. Did I find myself drinking to blackout status on the reg just to not feel feelings? Hell to the yes! (Please note that I don’t take this lightly. I’m a very sarcastic person with dry humor and laughing at myself is cathartic, I promise I’m okay.)

So why is this titled The Sober Socialite? I’m so glad you asked, friend! For whatever reason, perhaps boredom from being quarantined due to the ‘rona with lack of a Tiger King update to confirm Carole Baskin killed her husband, or just the epiphany I’ve had by entering outpatient treatment, I feel led to put a real and realistic face on addiction and substance abuse because as society, we done messed up with the current stereotype. So, let us begin. 

Chapter 1.
I’m not sure I was ever normal. I was made in Florida, my mom had moved down with a friend in her early 20’s, met my druggin’ and drinkin’ verbally abusive pos of a father (don’t worry, you’ll get all of the juicy deets on that douche canoe later on). When she got pregnant, he tried to convince her to sell me to a barren couple who were the children of their employer (in 1086 the going rate for a white baby girl was $100k y’all!). He was running around and cheating with other women, one of which eventually became my future and former stepmother (she was good peeps, I hope she’s resting in peace), so Mama moved us back to Ohio. I may be embellishing based on recollection, but I believe my mama asking to move back home and my grandpa saying no was one of the final straws in the camel’s back of the grandparents divorce. I’m not surprised, I’ve heard tons of stories about their turbulent marriage as he was a drunk. I think my favorite is that on Saturday’s, my grandma would set out a cold cut spread for lunch for all five kids to build their own sandwiches. My grandpa was supposed to shut down the gas/service station at noon and come home for lunch. One day he didn’t, and when he came home, she had cleaned up the spread. That jackass made her pull everything back out and sit there at the table with him while he ate. They argued, he threw a butter knife past her head and she stood up and with one fell swoop, swept that spread into his lap. He deserved it and I have Mary Sue’s back to this day, she was basically a parent to me growing up and one of my best friends. Plus, my limited memories of him were douche canoe status. I know it’s improper to speak ill of the dead, but my last memory of him was visiting him in the icu after I got my glasses in the third grade, he made fun of me and called me four eyes. He also refused to hold me until I was two because I was a illegitimate. So, not his biggest fan. You’ll get to hear more about Mary Sue’s bad self later. Trust me, it’s good stuff.",4,2

Firstly, I have to mention that my grandfather died of cirrhosis due to his alcoholism, and my direct cousin is currently dealing with cocaine addiction, so I think it’s important to mention my family history, despite me being a little skeptical about the nature/nurture aspect of genetical alcoholism addiction. Feel free to change my mind, though, if you believe it.

Anyhow, my question is: if you were my age, as someone who still has relative healthy relationship with alcohol (I drink a 3-4 times a week, at night, I never get nearly blackout drunk, just tipsy, although now that I’m thinking about it, it might be tolerance. I can drink a wine bottle a night and feel a little drunk, but if I drink 2/3 of it I’ll just be tipsy) 

But I still feel like my relationship with alcohol on sober days is starting to change. I feel grumpy, I wanna sleep earlier, I take sleeping pills. 

Where the hell do I go from here? I’m not at rock bottom, so I don’t feel like I would get much out of going to rehab, it feels unnecessary. Therapy is hard because of COVID right now. Trying to stop only leads to social drinking, which eventually becomes at-home drinking with my boyfriend (who I wish would drink less as well, just so I wouldn’t have it around, but he has a healthy relationship with it. He can have a beer, sleep and be fine. I wanna be awake and drink more, and take more Ritalin and do even more stuff. I’ve been diagnosed as BPD, although it’s been a few years and I feel like I changed so much I don’t really fit into the diagnostic criteria anymore, so I don’t know how much that could be a compulsion related to BPD, or something else. 

Please help. 

Where were you at my age? 

What would you have done differently? 

Do you have any advice on how to stop, be it gradually or cold turkey? 

I just don’t wanna fall down this hole.",8,1

I’m seeking advice on a more complicated side effect that comes from being sober. 

I’ve (23 F) been dating and in a long term relationship with my boyfriend (29 M) who is going through AA meetings to be sober. He is a little over 30 days since drinking and has got the chip. I support this change completely as drinking for him has not always, but often led to an array of issues in our relationship. 

My boyfriend has told me he drinks because he enjoys drinking and it is fun. I have never been a drinker but in the three years of our relationship felt myself pressured into drinking quite a few times. Not every incident was bad but there was always a few times in the year it severely impacted our relationship and in lieu of not drinking I support it and have made the commitment to not drink in support of my partner which has been fine. 

My advice I’m coming here for I guess is that since his serious efforts to quit drinking, he has been exceedingly mean and angry since he’s stopped drinking. He is always irritable, and although he is taking this time to work on some things including his fitness and health, I’ve noticed he has switched to smoking cigarettes and has been very angry during his time sober. His sleep schedule has also changed to staying up late and sleeping in to waking up early and going to bed early which I am fine with except any noise or movement at night I make has landed us in huge fights and arguments which seem to erupt out of nowhere. 

I love my partner and have wanted to pursue our relationship into marriage but it seems since he has stopped drinking he has become a completely different person. He is always irritable, distant, angry, and uninterested. He sees a therapist and has went to some AA meetings but I am wondering if anyone who has gone through something similar could provide me suggestions or insight on what I should do to support him from here on. I do not want him to drink and fully want to support a life of sobriety but it has been very difficult and confusing on our relationship and I’ve been told addiction is very hard and it sometimes takes several months to truly adjust. I do not want to give up on our relationship but worry it will not last during this time. Thanks for listening",3,0

I have a drinking personality that makes me talk waaaay too much and I have stuck my foot in my mouth or been a nuisance too many times. I quit drinking with the goal of it being a year in March and stuck it out for 3 months. However, my girlfriend who was living with me and I broke up and we’re trying to ride out the end of our (lease about 2 and a half months). The breakup was a good idea, but came as a distressing surprise, so I decided to pick drinking back up. A little at first, a beer a day or slow. That slowly grew over the course of a month to getting a bit tipsy most nights. After a conversation that indicated that trying to stay on the lease any longer would be harmful and unhealthy, I decided to move out and found a place in a hurry. Maintained similar drinking habits, an average of about 4 drinks a day. Everything seemed to be ok, no hangovers or getting real drunk, a few silly text messages but nothing memorable. However, I got really drunk/possibly got drugged on Sunday: ended up paralyzed in the street after 3 cocktails. It was very scary and thankfully I got a ride home from my roommate, whom I called and came to the rescue. I told some family members and have decided to stop drinking again. Probably for good. Thankfully, I am not really craving booze and think I can keep just not doing it, but alcoholism runs in my family and I’m scared that I’m an alcoholic and that it’ll make me slip up. Can anyone relate? Just wanna get out of my head and stay sober. I feel like the times that I’ve really embarrassed myself outweigh my interested in getting back into it.",15,0

I think the furthest I've ever made it without drinking is a month and a half, but some how I keep going back. I would tell myself I didnt have a problem, because I could go days sometimes even weeks without drinking. 


Last week, I saw a post about ""This Naked Mind"" and many people said it helped. So, I ordered it. I figured I might as well get the bundle and bought, ""The Alcohol Experiment"" and ""The Sober Diaries"" as well. 


Today they arrived. I began reading both ""This Sober Mind"" and ""The Alcohol Experiment"". Part of ""The Alcohol Experiment"" is being accountable to someone as well as journaling. I decided to make a new account so I can journal on here over the 30 days and look back.

#Day One


#Why do you Drink?

- I tend to lean toward the introverted side and alcohol makes me feel more social and comfortable (at first) when I am hanging out with people.

- It was something I did to relax after work. Forget about the day. Especially when it wasnt a great day.

- Coworkers would invite me out for various reasons. Either to have a fun night or have a discussion over a beer. 

- to be less irritable and take the edge off. 

- I often had work that I would take home and figured why not drink while doing it.

- Bored 

- Feeling as if I can open up to people and talk about things I dont necessarily want to talk about sober.

#Why am I doing the Alcohol Experiment 


- Fucked up my relationship. We would have fights when I drank. Not all the time, but enough. Even when I was away. I said mean things I can't take back and I am not proud of.

- Even though I feel relief when I open up to people, it is just for the night. The next day I either cant remember what I said or disappointed in myself for sharing whatever it was. I want to be able to open up without the assistance of booze.


- Tired of being unmotivated 


- Tired of trying to piece together the night before. How much did I drink. What did I say? Did I say things I will regret? Did I embarrass myself. For years, I would wake up to text messages I dont remember sending, but in my state, I wanted to be social and reach out. 


- Tired of waking up hungover. Hell, even if I somehow managed not to drink enough, i still wake up with dry mouth. 


- Tired of eating late at night to ""soak up the alcohol so my hangover wont be so bad tomorrow"" 


- Dont wanna spend the excess money.


- Dont wanna spend the day thinking that, ""If I just have one, I will be alright""


- Get in shape 

- Keep up on my hobbies 

- Do more around the house 

- I dont want to keep canceling plans that i make on my days off because i am too hungover in the morning and would rather use the time to recover from the night before.



It is nice looking at the list of why I want to stop drinking and seeing it longer than the list of why I drink.

I'm a 32 year old male who has struggled with alcoholism since I was about 18. I drank before that but it wasn't until I could buy it myself that I started to drink alone and that I started to abuse it. I primarily used it to deal with my depression and anxiety, but it slowly just became habit, even when my mental health started to get a bit better.

Although my mental health started to get better from what it was when I was younger, it has still held me back from completely getting better. Not only has it affected my mental health, it has affected friendships, family (although better now), jobs, finances, caused me to get a DUI in 2009, and has started making a much more noticeable affect on my physical health and appearance.

While my mental health has always taken a step backward from drinking, just recently I have started to notice worsening affects on my physical health, and it's kind of why I'm here right now. I have been generally pretty slim/fit for most of my life, not exactly healthy because I smoke too, but maybe it's because I'm getting older that I have started to take on weight, especially in my gut. My assumption is that drinking and not eating properly has finally caught up with me, and because I haven't been doing as much physical activity. 

I drank quite a bit last week because I wasn't scheduled for work, and then I worked Monday, and bought a 6 pack after work because I didn't work Tuesday. I could barely finish the 6 pack like I normally would be able to, so I had 2 left over for Tuesday. On Tuesday I decided what the hell and drank the last 2 beers, but of course I can't just have a little, so I went out and bought another 6 pack, even knowing I had to work today (Wednesday). 

Well, while I didn't wake up with an extreme hangover, I did wake up feeling very very uncomfortable. I knew I couldn't go to work like this so I called in. This made me anxious because I hate to call in after a night of drinking. Anxiety made me wanna smoke more, and when I went to buy a new pack of smokes I bought a redbull as well. Well the redbull wasn't smart either. My entire day has been a back and forth of muscle tension, shortness of breath, and then finally I started to feel dizzy. This started to make me feel even more anxious, and then I started looking at my gut and worrying more, like what have I done to myself, and is this going to get worse?

I had a shower and after I started shaking and feeling like I might faint. But it sort of went away. I tried to remember that this may just be a panic attack, but it also made me realize that, I have to stop living like this. 

So, I've decided to take a step I never have, and that's reaching out for support. Honestly, just sitting down and writing this has lowered my anxiety at least. I still have quit a bit of discomfort in my gut area and chest/back muscles, but that could be also from slouching at my desk right now and having been in bed all day.

I haven't had a drink today, and I want to continue that. So I'm going to try and use this as reminder of why I need to stop. I'm happy there is support like this on the internet, because I have a bit of hard time doing it in person. So expect to see me here more often, probably daily at this point.",4,0

Today I am three days sober and entering my fourth. As I enter this new day I thought I'd share my experiences so far. The first day was the easiest in terms of knowing that I didn't want to drink again. I was hungover that day and full of anxiety. But I knew I was done. The next day I immediately noticed I was irritable. I had several cravings throughout the day. I ended up going to see a friend at a pub and having soda water whilst they drank. I felt good about it and didn't once want a drink whilst there. The next day was the hardest. I spent the whole day craving alcohol. I found my mind was clouded and I was unable to concentrate on my work. I ended up taking a bike ride and fought it out in nature. I didn't drink in the end. After I came back home I realised how much time I had in the evening for myself. I almost didn't know what to do. Usually I'd be hungover or well into my drinking by this time. There are so many things I've enjoyed and now I see that I have the time for them. I'm feeling positive going forward. I plan to occupy my time by painting, sketching, cycling, going for walks. Working on my goals and dreams. Living. I know it's only been three days but for some reason I can see things for what they are. Seeing the drinking for what it was. I'm so happy to be consciously aware of my actions and taking steps towards getting my life back on track. If anyone is considering going sober and doesn't know where to start I hope this can give you motivation to do so. I know sobriety is going to be worth it for all of us.

Also I just want to say that I feel so lucky to have found this community. I've had some advice and support already from some of the other members and I'm very grateful.

I unfortunately am one of those folks that notices my PVCs. I’ve been to doctors, cardiologists, have had EKGs, pictures of my heart done, blood work and some other procedures- all of them have indicated that my PVCs are benign and nothing to worry about. Far easier said than done; and you most likely know what I mean if you experience these things. I’ve yet to find the ability to ho-hum my way out of the initial panic that sets in when they occur. 

My question is for any of you that have been sober for a while and experience/d PVCs: do you feel you have them less frequently? When/if they occur do you deal with the moment in an easier way than before? My anxiety is getting better from not drinking but my PVCs are occurring (or I’m noticing them) more. I remind myself “they’re benign, they’re benign, they’re benign” but I’m really interested in hearing what others have to say about their experiences in their sobriety. 

Just wondering.

I feel the never-gone urge to drink when offered, and typically turn it down politely. I invited a close friend who is a co-worker over for the 4th, and he brought me a case of pints. My wife knows my past, and told me to enjoy myself while grilling out and try to relax.

I have had 3 beers total in 4 days. In the past, my liver has been completely shot due to other life circumstances, and a good two years of drinking like a fish didn't help. That was 5 years ago, fortunately. I never quit-quit, but I'd go months if not years between even the smallest amount of alcohol, never getting piss-drunk when I did. Just one, typically nursed over the course of 2 hours, at social gatherings. 

I still have that case, non refrigerated so a beer is a conscious decision instead of a ""eh, I'm bored *crack*"". I feel overwhelmingly guilty over drinking, and the wife is neutral towards it because she knows I am not only hyper-vigilant due to my job and past, but have very, *very* few ways to destress. A cold beer on a boring evening is one of those for me. I just feel so guarded and a little ashamed of it, like a guilty pleasure but just bordering on the dam bursting and me just putting down 4 pints and calling it a night. 

I like to play videogames to destress too, but she says she thinks those are a worse problem than the occasional beer because I play games without a second thought, yet a single beer becomes a huge decision for me. Sometimes I end up cracking one open (in the past) taking two sips, pouring it down the drain in shame and then telling her. I've begun exercising a bunch lately, and have been doing better diet-wise as well. I just can't ever fucking relax.

I've been exercising more throughout the last several months, it felt nice to have some real, noticeable progress. Stopped the keto somewhat though because I was feeling really shitty, ""Keto Flu.""

Took time off from Friday before last and during last week, and I had just been craving a drink. Planned to just have maybe 3-4 bud light seltzers tops. That snowballed into an on and off multiday binge from Friday to Thursday, drinking heavily at least 4 days.

Last Friday notice my urine is bubbly when I pee. Already read previously that is a possible sign of kidney damage. I got worried, drank plenty of water, worked the weekend feeling like shit. Monday felt better but still pee bubbles. Tuesday decided that I would call the EAP and look into getting help this coming Friday.

Today went to work and could barely concentrate so worried about the damage I did to myself last week. I'm known as probably the most reliable employee there, so this was really abnormal when I asked to speak to my boss with the door closed and told him I needed to get checked out. He's a really good guy and even asked if I needed him to drive me, and later while I waited to see the doctor he already had found coverage standing by for the rest of my shift if needed.

I told the nurse and then the doctor about the pee issues (had been seen months ago but just for frequent pee, and I had got it all better after I stopped drinking, I wish I would have made a sober commitment back then). They asked how I was feeling, I was honest and told them I was planning on contacting EAP and wasn't sure how, that I was probably severely depressed and just break down crying in short spurts and then stopping when I'm alone, and that I realized I might have ptsd from work, I deal with a lot of tense situations for my job where there is danger involved and people rely on you to help them.

I got my blood and urine sample taken. Drove home. Ate like the third thing I've eaten since Monday (only have ate once a day since probably saturday).

I really hate myself for doing this to myself and not just being honest that I can't drink at all because I will either lose self control immediately or crave it more and feel unsatisfied and eventually cave in later.

The doctor asked me if I felt like hurting myself and I told him that I believed what I did to myself last week was a form of self-harm, which is true but not the full truth.

I don't know if I could live with the potential fallout from the damage that I've caused to myself. The doctor said that the EAP people are good about getting into contact within a day normally. I'm at home now in bed just waiting for the bad news and feeling a mixture between numb and wanting to break down crying with a massive feeling of impending dread about my test results tomorrow. My boss has already asked me to let him know if I need to be out tomorrow I'm thinking I might tell him yes in advance because getting bad news when I'm at work isn't what I want to happen, and I realized that I need to talk to someone about this as soon as possible.

If by some slim chance I'm still okay I've completely made up my mind to not drink anymore. If I'm not okay then the same. These last few days this place has really been a godsend, I wish I joined up and made changes years ago. Hell I wish I joined it just 2 weeks ago.",14,0

2296,2020-07-08 15:52:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hno5ev/back_to_the_beginning/,Back to the beginning,"Hello, good people.  I've just come across this sub after googling ""alcoholic myopathy.""  I feel that fact alone will probably tell you where I'm at.

I'm so happy to have found r/stopdrinking, particularly because I live abroad and, after the recent end of a relationship and the outbreak of Covid-19, am socially adrift.

Because I think it will be cathartic and help introduce me to whoever is reading this, let me share a bit of my story. In October 2013, aged 28, I started my recovery from alcoholism. At that time I drank daily, usually on a binge pattern. By the time I entered rehab I was at that point where I was always looking for liquor (raiding kitchen cabinets, sneaking drinks, etc.), unbearable when I couldn't have it.  I began attending AA and managed two-plus years of sobriety.  In the time of my sobriety I  accomplished many things that I had put off to drink in my 20s - I worked on a farm, I got my BA, I became credentialed as a language teacher. I was 31 when I started drinking again, trepidatiously - a beer or glass of wine here and there, always super conscious of the effects booze was having on me. Because I had worked on my awareness, because I had become more connected to my body and to other people, I felt I could drink casually and feel safe.

In 2018 I moved to Europe to pursue a career teaching, also hoping that by living in a country that I found inspiring and where the cost of living was slightly lower I would be able to devote myself more to writing fiction. The first year was wonderful. I learned the language, wrote a lot, started tutoring locals, experienced the vitalizing effects of culture shock, and met a lovely woman. Then two things happened. First, I passed through a series of housing crises. Second, I began work for a company that, I later found out, was allergic to paying its employees. I worked a gruelling schedule for months without a paycheque, needing to work a second job on the side to pay the bills until the pay for the first job came through. I lost my confidence, my mental health began to suffer and I started to self-isolate. My partner, who didn't have much experience with addiction and suffers from depression herself, was confused and overwhelmed. I was living in the apartment of the father of one of my students. The father was a man in his 80s who lived in another city and came in once or twice a month on  weekends. In the apartment was a well-stocked liquor cabinet that no one touched. I touched it. Then came the nights of staying up until the dawn, drinking half a bottle of whiskey, falling asleep on the floor, hangovers, poor social and economic judgment, and so on. That was Spring/Summer 2019. I ended up going to live with the lovely woman. I tried to not drink and the pent-up desire would explode in a night of binging. In the end I went on a spree that ended in a brothel. I told my partner what had happened and, hurt and angry, she asked me to leave. I did.

I spent some time back home with my family, walked to Santiago de la Compostela, stayed away from alcohol. Last November, with money from an inheritance, I bought an apartment in my adopted country, far away from the city where my former partner lived. I began to write and occupied myself with renovating the apartment. I entered into a cycle of getting on and falling off the wagon. In the meantime, my ex and I continued speaking. We tried to patch things up. Covid-19 came and the long-distance dynamic was sorely tested. She came to visit for the first time recently and I was a grouch. After she left I admitted that I had started drinking again. She cut off communication.

I feel stuck in a cycle of fear and self-recrimination, with occasional bursts of energy and insight. I have been speaking to a therapist and learning how much of the depression and anxiety I experience have their roots in perfectionist habits and lack of self-acceptance. But I need support to not drink. Recently I have been experiencing disquieting symptoms that I am sure blood work will reveal is alcohol-related: muscle spasms in my legs, transient chest pain, panic attacks. I do not drink as much as I used to, nor is my consumption on the very high end of the alcoholic scale. (For example, a typical seven-day cycle might look, with regards to drinks consumed, like 0-2-3-0-0-6-0 while a heavier cycle could be 0-3-5-0-0-12-0.) But it doesn't really matter how much - my life when I am sober is infinitely more fulfilling and ""right,"" both for myself and for my loved ones.

I have considered going back to AA, or looking into medications that suppress the pleasure associated with boozing. Therapy helps, exercise helps, community helps. I want to let go of the bad romance of alcohol. To remember what it is like to stay, even with fear and discomfort. I want to grow and change. I do not want to harm my body or my heart (or the bodies or hearts of anyone else) any longer.

I want to start off by thanking all of you for being such an incredible community. The stories you share, the uplifting comments to our struggling brothers and sisters and just the all around feel of camaraderie I really get from this sub-thread. AA never worked for me - but this group has been a really great ""substitute"". Instead of saying ""one day at a time""  I remind myself that there are thousands of people that ""Will Not Drink With Me Today"" and that even if I fail, I know you guys are here to lift me back up. 

This is not my first attempt at sobriety, but this is CERTAINLY the longest. I have never felt as confident in my sobriety as I do now and I truly view it as a long term ""life change"". Right now, I have zero desire to drink again. I know that can change and I will continue to be wary of my old habits creeping back up when I feel safest. 

Today I celebrate my 6 months of sobriety (I do still indulge in the greenery a bit, but in a healthy manner when I am off work and over the weekends.). Today I am so fucking proud of myself that I could cry.

I want to tell you guys a little story about my day, if you don't mind.  

 I have been at the same job for 6 years making very little money in a purely commissioned sales position. My boss and her son have become my extended family. I love them as if they were blood.. even moreso. I am a very loyal and committed person to those in my life, so the ONE downside to this wonderful relationship was that I felt trapped in this dead end, low paying job that was unable to provide me the resources I needed to survive independently. I wasn't even pulling in $17K a year and yet just COULDN'T bring myself to leave my position and leave my boss dead in the water. This has caused a myriad of problems for me. Least of all being that I had to move one hour away to live with my father for the last year.  There's a whole lot of backstory I can't tell right now until things are more airtight as a whole, but I just had an interviews with another company in my industry and SLAYED that shit. I am being given an immense amount of responsibility and the pay to go along with it. This will change my life DRAMATICALLY. I mean dramatically. I thought I'd never have an opportunity like this in my life. Especially during a pandemic. SO this is great news that I am very thankful for. 

Now - on the way to my interview I was pulled over. I was not speeding, I thought I was driving perfectly. The officer tells me I was swerving all over the road and she thought I was drunk. She then proceeded to (very strangely if you ask me) ask to search my person and my car. I didn't have time to argue as I was going to be late for my interview so I complied. She asked me MANY times if I was drunk or on drugs, searched my car, patted me down and was just acting.... fucking weird. She eventually let me go after yelling ""STAY CLEAN!!"" before I drove off (after telling her I'd been sober for 6 months). Now while this bothered me - I had to give myself a high five. Because 7/8 months ago I would have still had alcohol on my breath from the night before. I would have totally destroyed this opportunity before I even made it to the interview. 

At the height of my drinking, I wasn't an every day drinker so I didn't think I had a problem. I would justify that I only drank 2-3 days a week and never at home alone. But man... I was getting BLACK OUT wasted, railing lines of shitty cocaine and ending up at sketchy ass, sweaty ass after-parties. Sleeping with people I didn't know and that in any normal case I wouldn't WANT to know. I'd spend days in a pit of suicidal self loathing afterwards and my quality of life was a complete nightmare. I hated myself and I let the world know that every single time I was wasted. I was a mess. A crying, heaving, fighting, slutty, blacked out, coked out mess. 

&#x200B;

Today I am feeling thankful for my sobriety. Thankful for this group of incredibly wonderful human beings. Thankful for these new opportunities on the horizon. 

&#x200B;

For those of you struggling, it's okay. You can do this. You really can. If I can do it, I PROMISE you that you can do it. You are worth giving yourself every opportunity out there. You are WORTH a better life. You are worth being loved and loving yourself. 

For those of you steadfast in your sobriety, thank you. Because you have shown me (and many others) that it can be done and that life is better on the other side. You are superheroes in my eyes.

Not one in particular, but essentially any.","As I have continued to participate here at SD through my continued sobriety, a consistent theme I see in posts is ""this keeps not really working, what do I do?""

I think nearly everyone who achieves some longer-term sobriety has gone through this point. Try, fail. Try, fail. Now what?

The most well known program seems to be AA, and for as many people who succeed in AA, there are at least as many who object to AA for entirely valid reasons.

I'm going to talk a little by analogy right now. I am trying to fix some financial issues in my life. There are a lot of books about finance, but I came across one that has a program. It basically says: ""do these nine steps of learning, and when you do them with integrity and effort and in communication with others on the journey ... you will learn what you need to know."" The program doesn't tell you what the answers are, it actually says there are no right answers. It is a program that helps you determine what YOUR answers are.

I'm working on step one of that financial program right now largely because I had tremendous success with a recovery program (which happened not to be AA but that is basically a side point).

Any program will do. If it has some steps I can take as a process and a learning journey, I have a much better chance of finding my answers that work for me.

So if you find yourself stuck and you don't know how to get past some blockage, whether that is a number of days or some regular trigger or whatever that is, I highly encourage seeking out a program that has a process. It is something that has worked very well for me, and I hope to pass that hope for success on to as many others as I can.",2,0

I have been lurking here for months now, especially when hungover and miserable. This is my first post here and the first day I intend to be completely sober. I would read the stories of people making the same kinds of mistakes that I have made while drinking, and I would just cry and cry because I totally related to whatever was being said. The embarrassment, blacking out, not remembering what I did/said but knowing it was bad because of how anxious I felt the next day, when little snippets of the night before would come back to me with a wave of shame. Waking up feeling like shit, not getting anything done. My anxiety has never been worse. I cannot remember the last day I went without at least 1 drink, or was completely sober from everything (including anxiety meds, kratom, pot, etc).

I started drinking about 5 years ago. Once I discovered alcohol I drank as much as I could whenever I could. This led to some of the most dangerous and stupid moments of my life, including mixing alcohol with other drugs such as benzos and coke, fighting tooth and nail with my parents and boyfriend, and just generally fucking up my life. Then I got pregnant, and I stopped everything immediately. It wasn't hard for me because I didn't want to hurt my baby. I remember feeling a lot better during my pregnancy; I think that was the most peaceful I had felt in a long time. After my son was born I slowly let my habits creep back in. Fastforward three years and I am back to drinking every day; while I do not get drunk every day, I do feel that drinking is a HUGE crutch for me as a way to ignore my underlying depression and anxiety. I am pretty lonely and don't have many friends; the friends I do have are almost all drinkers too so that's what we tend to do when we hang out. My town is very boring and a lot of people just drink because that's all there is to do. I have gained probably 20 pounds, I feel sick and out of shape, my eyes are puffy either just in general or from crying. 

In the past couple of weeks (and ever since quarantine, really) I have spent copious amounts of money on booze. I like craft beer which tends to be like 12 bucks and up for a 6-pack, which I can drink all to myself. (Thats like 1800 calories!!) I have gotten drunk a few times in the last two weeks where I was really really mean to my boyfriend and said horrible hurtful things. My bf drinks too, but lately I have been the one who is out of control. I have never felt so pathetic and full of shame in my life. Getting drunk reinforces my belief that I am a bad person who no one would ever like, and that I am nothing but a mistake because look at how shitty I acted! What sucks is that no one except for my boyfriend (and my parents a little bit; they don't see me at my worst but they suspect it) realizes that I have these issues; I am a ""functional"" alcoholic I guess, or I guess I just don't drink ""enough"" to appear to really have a problem. I am a good mother, a straight-A college student, and a hard worker. The point is, for me it's a problem, and I want to stop trying to use alcohol as a bandaid for my emotional issues.

 I really hope to change my relationship with alcohol, and not to depend on it. I hope that being sober will over time decrease my anxiety and panic attacks, which are the number one problem in my life right now. The anxiety and depression are like two vicious dogs that constantly nip at each other to keep fighting. I want to lose weight and be able to fit in all my cute clothes that I used to wear. I want to be able to enjoy small things, like a book or a cup of coffee, the way I did when I was younger before I ever discovered the ""need"" to put foreign substances of any kind into my body to feel ""better."" It's not better. My bf says I just want anything to make me feel different, and that's true. I don't want to have to feel different; I hope someday I can just be happy being me. That's all.",5,1

Problem is, small town, so it's not really anonymous at all. I've definitely heard AA members talking about certain people who went to a meeting and ""fell off the wagon"" etc. Which I don't think is right.

And sure I know some people who AA has done great things for them but I also know a lot in AA that seem like downright miserable people. 

Also the whole, ""you are a diseased alcoholic forever"" and ""just one drink away from oblivion/devastation"" 

And then apologizing to a bunch of people, just seems .... weird. In my twenties yeah lol. lots to apologize for, but for right now, I'm sort of a binge cycle drinker who is only hurting myself. 

So not to take this the wrong way because I do not want to drink anymore, so i'm not looking for a cure so I can ""still"" drink. I'm on day 4 here, and the sleep shit is tough at the moment. But I do want to be fully sober, and no treat drinks etc

I am not doing well. My drinking has increased a lot lately. I’ve had stretches of sobriety before, but am now in a cycle where I might have a day here and there.

It’s confusing because I don’t even WANT to drink. Before I got my mental health sorted, I definitely self medicated to get a break from my brain. But now I don’t even enjoy it, it’s just a thing I do.

I’m in counseling. I exercise (not this week due to an injury, but I usually run and do yoga). I journal. I try to eat healthy. But every afternoon/evening, my resolve wanes and I have lots of excuses. A drink will be nice while cleaning. I usually have a beer when I write. It’s 4th of July. It’s the weekend. Beer is tasty.

For me, less anxiety, and improved sleep are huge motivators. Sleep in particular. I always struggle with insomnia, but it’s worse when I drink. And my mental health is SIGNIFICANTLY better when I wake up early in the morning, which I never do when I drink.

How do I break this cycle? I no longer want to drink it’s just this habit I can’t break. Thanks for any insight from you folks with some time under your belt!",7,0

HOLY SHIT Y’ALL,"I posted yesterday about some anxiety I had over getting some blood tests done for my liver. Well, they came back today and let me just preface this: Stop. Drinking. Now. You can change your health for the better, and bodies have an amazing resiliency and ability to bounce back. If this isn’t proof, I don’t know what is.


For reference, I had blood work done in August of 2018. I was in the height of my drinking; I was stressed from planning my wedding, and probably self medicating with something in the range of 2-3 handles of vodka per week or 2-3 big boxes of Franzia per week. I would guess I averaged between 12-20 drinks per day, and had been drinking regularly trending up since 2012.


I’m 5’2”, female, 29 at the time of last tests, 31 today. Besides not drinking in the last 6 months, the only real change I’ve made is adding an almost daily hot yoga practice, but only over the course of the last month. I drink approximately one fuckload of tea per day, and I try to eat mostly whole foods, although admittedly there’s been a bit of extra pizza and red meat in my life for the last two months. It’s a global pandemic, let me eat my feelings.


I have some vitals from my last results as well, and I’ve included standard, healthy ranges (per Quest Diagnostic Labs) for reference where I have them. A few of my own thoughts where relevant as well.


**HEIGHT**: 5’2”

**WEIGHT**

Standard BMI: 18.5-24.9

2018: 139 lbs, BMI 25.4

Today: 130 lbs, BMI  24.8


**RESTING HEART RATE**:
Standard: 60-100 bpm

2018: 88 bpm

Today: 74 bpm


This is realistically mostly due to starting yoga over the past month. I checked my heart rate myself around the start of June, and it was still closer to the 85-90 range.


**CHOLESTEROL, TOTAL**:

Standard: < 200mg/dL

2018: 242

Today: 208


Still a touch over the high end of healthy, but still down pretty significantly from 2018! This generally applies to all of my cholesterol results, but I’m pretty confident I can get these down to a healthy level through continued diet and exercise.

**HDL CHOLESTEROL** (the “good” cholesterol)

Standard: > OR = 50 mg/dL

2018: 100

Today: 65


I’m no doctor, but from what I’ve read 100 is abnormally high and can cause its own health problems. I’m happy with this one.


**LDL CHOLESTEROL** (the “bad” cholesterol)

Standard: < 100

2018: 92

Today: 120


My one bad change/result, from the high end of healthy in 2018 I’m up a bit today. My takeaway? Probably time to cut back on the red meat and dairy, both of which I’ve been pretty overboard on lately.


**TRIGLYCERIDES**

Standard: < 150 mg/dL

2018: 252

Today: 121


HOLY SHIT. My triglycerides are >50% lower than two years ago. This is genuinely insane to me, to go from almost double the high end of healthy into a much more reasonable range. Good job body, good job.

**AST** (Liver Enzyme):

Standard: 10-30 U/L

2018: 88

Today: 13


**ALT** (Liver Enzyme)

Standard: 6-29 U/L

2018: 103

Today: 14


Combining my thoughts on these two because HOW in the HELL. I remember getting the results in 2018 and absolutely being terrified. I was almost triple the high end of the standard results for both AST and ALT. I know damn well I was told this by multiple doctors as far back as 2013/2014, but I don’t know that I ever saw how far off from the standard I was until I had this report in my hands. 


It freaked me out at the time, but I did absolutely nothing about it. After all, I was getting married in two months, had an all inclusive honeymoon on the books, and it was easier to drink myself into a state of apathy than to actually address that I had a problem. I knew ultrasounds had shown I was developing a fatty liver, but I kept telling myself I just needed to eat better. I never wanted to acknowledge that what you drink is part of what you eat.


I planned to post my results good or bad; I like numbers and facts and I thought this might help someone like me to see what six months of no alcohol can really do for your body. I absolutely still have some things to work on, but I’m floored and so happy to see numbers in healthy ranges when in the back of my mind I thought I’d done some irreversible damage. The body can do amazing things when you give it the opportunity to heal, and the sooner you quit, the better your chances. I’ve been struggling with thinking about trying to moderate, but this just goes to show I made the right decision and the path I chose is the healthiest one for me.


All of my other numbers were within a healthy range, but if there’s anything specific anyone would like to see, please let me know and I’m happy to share!

I recently came across this sub, after spending a few hours surfing the internet in regards to alcohol abuse. 

You see, today is my 3rd day being sober. I've been actively drinking since I was 24yrs old, which all started as just casual drinking (ex. Having drinks on girls night out, a few drinks on date night, and so forth). But over the years of just drinking once a week or twice a week, has led me to drink pretty much every day. (I'll probably be sober for a day or a day and half, and then go back to drinking again). My choice of poison is tequila.

I pretty much can finish a whole bottle by myself without even feeling buzz anymore, which then leads me to open another one.

Well recently, both my body and mind have been realizing that this is not right and I no longer enjoy drinking every night. It's no longer fun, I guess I can say (which sounds weird and bad to say) . I hate feeling tired, feeling nauseous throughout the night and day,  not being able to get a good night rest, or waking up in the middle of the night pucking, etc... I just don't want to drink everyday..

 HOWEVER..

 I do want to be able to go back to the days where I could go out once a week, have a drink with friends or my partner, know my limits, and call it a day and not depend on alcohol or Continue drinking the rest of the week. 

So do you think there's such thing as ""healthy"" drinking, for someone who has been abusing it for the last few years?

I feel terrible asking this question here because I read so many wonderful stories of being sober, and am over here asking a question about not necessarily being all sober.

Hope to hear your thoughts.

A new friend,
Mary.",3,0

 Here’s the question I’ve got. How do I deal with the regret that seems to flood over me these days? It’s nothing huge like crashing cars, losing jobs, relationships or loved ones, or injuring people or myself. It’s stupid stuff, crass comments, unkindnesses, moments of idiocy that now I’m sober seem just dreadful. People I still know and love (some of whom seem even still to love me), people I’ve lost touch with, people I only ever met once; memories of crappy interactions come flooding back at such regular intervals I catch myself berating myself out loud. 

All this regret’s washing over me in waves. I don’t know if it’s a past me, or a younger me, or a drunk me coming back to tell the me now that I was a fucking moron and I ought never to forget it or what. Can I deal with it, or do I just accept it, or does it leave me alone?

So I’m one month sober today, go team me! I’m 32 and basically spent the entirety of my 20’s drunk and have only in the past year or so gotten help for it and have recently made the next step to being fully sober. 

I was just wondering if any other people have had similar issues with their skin. The skin on my face has always been really horrible because I was drinking to the point of blacking out almost every day and smoking too. Since going sober however I’ve found that I’m getting more and more spots with worse break outs every single day it feels like. 

I’ve tried googling and some websites say it’s toxins coming out into the surface of your skin while others say that that’s not true and that it could be hormonal imbalances and all kinds of things. 

I was just wondering if anyone had had this kind of experience and what their kind of timelines were.

I feel like a fucking failure. I’m 25 and I’m ready to just give up. I feel like I’ve wasted my potential on partying and getting fucked up. 

When I was in school, I was a smart kid. Teachers always praising me, great test scores. Even when I started smoking weed when I was 12, I was keeping up with my school work. But, towards the end of high school I started getting into hard drugs and almost dropped out. College never crossed my mind because at that point I was just like, fuck it, I’d rather get fucked up. 

I think a lot of that stems from losing my Dad as a kid. Never knew the guy, and pretty much lived in poverty with my Mom most of my life. Add a couple of failed relationships and a couple of convictions on top of that, and things really started to pile up emotionally. 

The longest I’ve ever been sober since starting the drinking and drugging was probably about a year and a half while I was on probation. But even towards the end of that I said fuck it again while still on probation. I managed to get off without my probation officer finding out. By that point they weren’t drug testing me anymore, and I was fucking miserable. So I got back on the bottle pretty heavily. Heavier than ever actually. 

I’m a bartender, so access to alcohol is constant. By the end of last month I was averaging 10-12 shots just at work, and then going to the bar afterwards. Wake up feeling like shit and doing it all over again.

I got sick a couple of weeks ago, like really sick. Pretty sure I contracted Covid, but got tested too late and my results came back negative. I still haven’t told my job I got my results back yet so I’m technically laid off. And I don’t want to fucking go back, I hate my fucking job. But, I’m starting to go broke again and I’m probably going to have to go back. Why does that matter? Because out of the 16 days I haven’t been at work, I’ve only drank for two of those days. I want to stop drinking so bad. But, my job makes me feel so miserable I just want to numb it. Being there makes me feel like I’m wasting my life away. 

After I got sick I stopped drinking because of how bad I felt. That lasted about 12 days and then I got a 12 pack of IPA’s and started another two day bender because I was bored. Now here I am again, the beginning of day three with no alcohol and I really want to stop. 

Does anyone else feel hopeless when they stop drinking again? Or has anyone else been a bartender when they decided to quit drinking? That’s gonna be a tough one. I want to get a different job, but I have no skills outside of the service industry, and no college degree obviously. I just feel lost, and I’m really fighting the urge to get fucked up again, even though I know it’s just going to make my situation worse.

I have been waking up hangover free for a long time and I know I should not take for granted how happy and full of energy I am now. And what I've been able to accomplish in the last year because I stopped drinking. 

Summer time is a trigger for me. Holiday time is a trigger. I feel torn because I crave down time and I feel I deserve it. I need to rewire my brain in what going on vacation is without drinking every day. How to enjoy going out for dinner without ordering a bottle. I'm scared I won't have the willpower. I'm scared I will trick myself in thinking I can handle it. For now I've tried to mitigate that risk by planning some outdoor active excursions during my vacation, where I really want to feel fit for! Also I agreed with my partner to prepare dinner at the accommodation for most nights. Hoping this will do the trick. 

I like reading here on this sub but also at the same time I feel like failing because I can't commit in my head to never drinking again. I'm sort of jealous of people who just KNOW that they're done. It's hard for me to not romanticize some of the boozy moments. Even though I fully know they weren't so pretty. My mind tends to forget the bad things. Which is mostly nice but really unhelpful in regards to alcohol abuse.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Another quick, short post today:

A very old friend of mine once told me 'It is usually better to be nice than to be right'. For a long time I didn't really understand what that meant. Since I've been sober, I've been thinking about this more and more, and I think I finally get it.

So I suppose the question I have today is: What does this quote mean to you, and how would you try implementing this idea in your life?",101,0

I'm happy.

One thing I really feel is the additional income.

When I was drinking it didn't seem like I was 'drinking my account away'

I always had some money, and didn't spend it all on alcohol - hey - I had a budget.
It did not occur to me that I was spending say at least half of my wallet *everyday* - for years

It just felt like, on that one day, I drank half of what I had.

But this was everyday. On alcohol.

And so two years later, I understand that half of my wallet everyday on stuff I drank and then pissed out - is a lot.

With nothing to show for it.

Those memories of a good night out? Gone. 

I still find myself short of money as my priorities have changed - but - *I also find myself with savings...which is shocking!*

They are not stable savings but I'm able to have something available during hard times so I'm not bouncing from boom to bust - if you know what I mean.

And even when I get to the end of my savings, I find I'm able to get there in a stable way - and then at the end of that time, there is some money coming in, and savings build again.

I do the things that I like to do, I can travel a little more and I can provide security for my partner.

The other day I watched him free and laughing - in the house that we own - and I felt proud and happy.

We're signing ownership papers in a few months - and he's going to get half exactly - and I'm proud.

I'm fifty so I have a hard time looking over my failures.

I'll never be a film-maker - it was a failed career and it's never coming back. Thirty years.

Many relationships will also not come back.

My self-respect still suffers.

I remember - vaguely - how difficult the first year was.

At the end of that year, I was completely depressed. I didn't leave the house, I couldn't cope with being around people who 'had it all'

I was craving all the time - and tired of running at the slightest suggestion that I would drink again.

I would just get up and leave, no matter what I was doing, no matter who I was with.

It was crazy. No excuses, just gone. Whatever I was doing.

I had been trying for ten years and this time, I don't know, just one more day. One more hour. One more ten-minute block I was fighting for with everything.

Day in. Day out.

----+----

I'm two years free.

I don't crave.

I pray a lot and I'm enjoying this relationship. It's not specifically Christian - but you know, Faith and belief - so moving through life without necessarily assurance of anything - but with the hope that choosing happiness, showing love and being forgiving - is creating a life I am proud of, and an environment around me that others enjoy.

I'm happy.

I just wanted to check in, really. I've been feeling a LOT better than I did in my first month. Anyone who is struggling in early sobriety, I hope you hang in there. It was pretty horrendous for me and there were several times I thought, 'God, it's soooo much easier to just drink and stay at that gutter-level of emotionless existence and never have to put energy into changing anything.""

But I'm glad I did change. I didn't really get a 'pink cloud', it was more of an ascension out of the daily battle to feel anything but miserable. I had all sorts of physical symptoms that convinced me I was dying. I had massive mood swings, terrible problems sleeping (these aren't quite fully resolved, but I think that's normal for me), thoughts of self-harm, and general malaise. I now feel....normal, I suppose. I sometimes get little sparks of joy and happiness, but mostly I'm 'on the level', which is kind of nice. I'm also WAY more sensitive and I cry easily, at good things and bad. 

Part of what I realised, and it's something I've known for a while, is that I'm a naturally sensitive person. I feel things very strongly and react to things more intensely than what may be considered 'normal'. I found a lot of comfort and solidarity in reading r/hsp and normalising a lot of the things I've felt my entire life. And I think alcohol was a way of numbing all of that stimulation and emotion. It was often much easier to NOT feel than it was to accept that I am naturally sensitive and have a need for firm personal boundaries (still working on these). 

Anyway. Just checking in. Thanks to you all.",7,0

It's past midnight and I can't sleep so I've decided to make a two-mo update. I notice some recent new comers (perhaps eye-opening moments during quarantine) who want to learn about what to expect during the sobriety journey.

Over Mother's Day weekend, I stopped and I bought a home gym set off Amazon for the garage. I only set it up at the end of May, but have tried to use it once or twice a week since then.  I feel great physically, but mentally I think I still feel a bit shrouded perhaps due to an inconsistent sleep schedule while unemployed (sleep anywhere from 1am-5am and wake up between 10am-1pm).

I am seriously SOOO sorry/embarrassed/ in disbelief/ angry/etc at some stuff I did while drunk that I look forward to this new journey. I briefly tuned in to a friend's AA meeting last week and it was reassuring to see people in worse scenarios than me as a way to catch myself before I accidentally take a bigger fall.

Socially, I've gotten comfortable in telling people I stopped drinking. It's pretty easy during COVID to avoid bars, but it's still nice to drive out to Starbucks to get a coffee and sip on something. 

I don't even feel any urge to drink while passing through the booze aisle at the store and it's honestly disgusting that Alabama college kids are hosting COVID parties.  All the shared cups from beer pong just gross me out now.

I suppose the next obstacles will be when I totally accept accountability that drunk me is not normal sober me (for the actions I did, some not fixable and painful to others) and what I'll do when society opens back up.",5,3

At the time I was recently divorced and took my pain out through the perceived idea that the bottle would help.  Unsurprisingly, it did not.  I went to AA for a while and thoroughly enjoyed my time there (even though I'm not religious). In the aftermath of my divorce and independence, I convinced myself that the reason for my drinking was because of the emotional abuse I suffered from my ex-wife. Though it played a major part into the level that I got to with my drinking, it was obviously not the only excuse.  I work overnights at a grocery store and between being opposite schedules of everyone I know, and therein be alone all of the time, it started to get bad again (thanks covid). yay boredom. 

In the past 1.5 years at this point, it has progressively gotten worse again, and I'm trying to find a way to get/make myself  stop.  In many ways, I'm ready to make this change, but, in so many ways I don't know how to stop it all. 

At a minimum of 2 days a week, I say in my head 'I'm ready to be done', but while I say those things, I pick up another bottle of something else.  Justifying the idea that maybe if I drink this, that 'since it is  a lesser proof' that it may affect me differently and I may not get as hooked. I know, the idea is broken.

I guess I came here looking for even the smallest amount of support.  Unfortunately in the time of covid-19, it's hard to find the support that we need.  My parents/siblings are all like 'great job!'. but unfortunately coming from someone who doesn't suffer from addiction doesn't know the pain of it all.

Then Realized I was Making Room for What I Needed.,"TL;DR:  This is extremely long but it marks a very monumental point in my life and I’ve been using posts as a way to catalog my most tenacious attempt at sobriety. There’s a few places I may have went awry but I’m not going to proof read it after doing it all on my phone. I need to take a walk or something. Anyways, the main point is we’re all here because we understand our affliction and that because we do it’s vital to us all to have a place to feel safe and welcome even when we don’t in our own skin. It’s always amazing to me when I see someone post “long time lurker, but I want this now” and I’ve only been around for a short time, but seeing that is making an life changing impact. It wasn’t easy to join the sub as I had no idea really what would go on but I’m making it what works for me (with rules in mind) and it’s encouraging me to keep taking those “scary” steps in the direction that I want to my life go. Instead of just drinking along in the misery of my own creation, I said fuck that life I want something better. 

Change is only scary because it’s not familiar. Wouldn’t it be weird if you felt the same way about changing your underwear? Gross, like comfortable old bad habits. Embrace the change. We all got this. IWNDWYT

Probably wanna empty your pee bottle before starting... here it goes!

*Tonight* gave me a clarity and feeling of security that I haven’t felt from a person I actually knew but because I know them very personally they were able to transcend the words so many strangers in AA, groups, these boards, etc have been saying since I started trying to regain my sanity through sobriety.

**”You’ve got this.”**

The words have taken almost 10 years to have the bit of impact they do now. Like each voice stacks and it gained enough to help me when I was in trouble, its momentum was great enough to cause a wave in my actions.

I’ve been saying for a long time that I’m very misunderstood for many reasons but addiction/alcoholism/mental health isn’t causing me to wear rainbow socks and sport a Mohawk, no, that’s a different insanity I call my unique personality.

I refused to do anymore therapy after the first court ordered three all concluded I probably had father issues but that didn’t make me drink. I’ve been on my own and independent for so long I don’t even let people in anymore because they’ll eventually leave and bring pain and such so why bother? That doesn’t make me want to drink though!

What makes me want to grab some knock out juice, btw this was all part of my last few weeks revelations as I seriously look at myself and cut the bullshit and be honest. I was always afraid of the truth because if I didn’t acknowledge it then it wouldn’t be real.

That’s pretty clever for a ethanol and other chemicals altered brain which gained further foundation in this facade with every ignorance to the truth.

I am absolutely fine around alcohol if it doesn’t enter my body. In fact I absolutely have hated for the last 10 of my 16 years drinking. My first DUI and everything it cost me and my family devastated me but didn’t stop. It’s just so easy to get. It’s in our faces in everything all day. Good day? Drink. Bad? Drink. Celebrating or mourning there’s a drink for you! Bored?

..,ah maybe this has legs... but I digress.

I never stopped and I continued to hide from anything and everything in life that seemed “scary” cause it was unknown to me so I just ran, I had no one to say otherwise. No one in my corner. I reached out but with hollow canned or dismissive response, if any.

I’ve ran and hid behind booze when things were bad and I just wanted it to go away. When I eventually come back the problem wouldn’t even be a memory.

That is not how to handle a life. Constant fear followed by black out drunk which added their own more exciting problems which can be easily solved with more booze!

That’s my cycle. Do my best, encounter problems I’m not sure how to handle or approach so run, hide, ignore it’s only real if we make it real. 

I realized the cycle a few months back but no clue how to stop it other than start by not drinking. Then start looking for help. Once a few weeks went by I didn’t see any reason for help, I’m fine, it was a fluke. A 10+ year fluke. That part didn’t register though cause I had already slipped back into thinking I was invincible—until the next big problem.

I thought moving to my hometown was the solution but within a month had been disowned by my family and broken my spine which I had to wait 5 days to detox before they could do surgery. Just lay flat by myself and after all the hallucinations and etc passed (my entertainment since I lost my glasses and didn’t have my phone) it didn’t even occur to me how in trouble I was. I’ve been digging holes for so long and gotten out, I can do it again. 

Not a single blood relative to this day has asked anything about me. Thank you alcohol. I was almost sent to a homeless shelter when I got discharged because no one wanted anything to do with me. TWO HOURS BEFORE DISCHARGE I HAD FINALLY CALLED MY FAMILY THINKING THE WHOLE TIME “Everything is fine, just another one of my “hiccups” but a major spinal injury, heh, what else was I going to do?”

Didn’t care so much that my sister somehow slammed a cell phone down so hard it hung up and stung my ear. 

I really had no one in my corner... well because they don’t understand me! I’ll keep trying! It’s only 11 fused vertebrae and my umteeth time narrowly escaping death, just ignore it until the dust settles and it’ll be fine.

I’ve ignored everything that was warning me of “the worst to come” then let my ego and sense of invincibility take me right back through the cycle. So I made it to where I am. Always seeming to find just what I need to get by, but always less. A steady quality of life degradation.

Alone with three friends left in this world keeping me company at first every day for a week to ensure I’ll be okay then two now only one. The others are still friends but with their own lives that I understand but thankful they’re always the same three when I’m in another “dilly of a pickle”.

My last friend has offered for me to come stay with them as I get my life back but I’m so horrified of what awful things I might do and lose that relationship and hurt his family that I’ve been hoping he’d change his mind. 

So tonight when we talked and I had told him I slipped up and drank he gave me some info to find the mental health pros I had already sworn to establish by July 25th This sub was my first step at finding help because I WANT THE CHANGE. No one else is going to do it for me. Then it dawned on me: I’m not alone doing it but I also didn’t wait for anyone to find me.

I made the steps to take control and do the scary stuff. Admit to myself the truth. Acknowledge it’s not weak to need help then take baby steps to get it.

Now I had my friend and this sub. Full of strangers who are now face and voiceless unlike AA (which makes it way easier to participate and ease in than being surrounded by all these people who are DEFINITELY judging me but they have the problem, not me). 

This helped me finally understand that I’m not alone. Each post I read felt copy-pasta’d from mine or another persons story. Each time I saw the words coming to terms through text to THE ENTIRE INTERNET, I realized the most important person to see it was themselves. Every time I face this enormous confluxtion it becomes something real I can’t hide from until it kills me. (I just imagined the poster from the movie “I Kill Giants” and it’s exactly how I see myself right now).

But this was only a step and I already slipped up good once, which was mildly defeating. Ole Alchy tried to tell me it was dumb and these faceless people could be children in China or some scam. The “IWNDWYT” means nothing, no one would know. The “You got this!” Is pure crap, they don’t even know your first name. It’s a shitty version of AA for lazy people. 

I often wonder if anyone else has an imagination that when driven by booze-booze train can be so imaginative and harsh. 

On Friday 3 July I woke up in bad shape and I knew I had to stop. I laid on my air mattress all day and picked up my phone. Opened Reddit and front page had more and more posts on it from r/stopdrinking than anything else. It was at least 2-3 SD then something else for as far as I could scroll, so as I laid their, I read them all.

I had just started to fill my sobriety tool box but I’ve gone a lot longer in sobriety without even believing there was a problem. So if I’m actually trying but it feels like failure faster am I doing something wrong? Maybe Alchy was right, give up... or...dig deep and work harder for what I want.

Still, with everything I’ve said about not being alone it was a hollow sensation. The lack of faces and voices helped me get comfortable with myself and see I’m not alone but not feel it. I’m not really sure if anyone can tell at any moment who really is there for them at any moment in life. I notice when I’m mad at the ones who talk to your face about how they’re all real then when you say how much it would mean to myself if they’d visit one weekend because I’m really in need of a friend and respond on Monday apologizing but for sure in a few weeks they might be free. If anyone has people like that I’d gut them right now because even if you think they’ll “be awash with guilt if some terrible happened!” You’re dead wrong. They’ll probably even talk about the future plans you just made and it’s so sad it won’t happen.

But I digress...

So as I discuss with my friend about the other things I’ve done to progress getting all the tools I need we have a long chat, through text, on my phone. All of this is in my phone. I have the sexiest damn thumbs I can’t see cause my eyes are shot staring at this screen. (Looking for a used laptop now as other priorities required a LOT of funds. Bills don’t go away if ignored, just go to collections) Since I was honest with him about my slip up he wanted to ensure I was still working on getting all my tools. I told him I had a checklist for tomorrow and it included doctors. Body and mind for my head and my spine! He seemed relived to hear that and because he speaks completely monotone IRL text accurately conveyed him.

He told me he just want me to have the best life possible and cares as a 100% true friend (his words). Then said the alcohol concerned him especially since the last time I fell off and went AWOL he thought I was dead.

I went into how alcohol is my definite downfall but it became that way because it’s readily available everywhere. It gave me the escape I wanted almost immediately as the problem arose. 

“If I’m not living the life I enjoy then I don’t want to be conscious in the one I’m muddling through.”

Yeah, I said it. That’s 100% Alchy inspired loser slogan that I typed without even thinking hit me like so many other things as I actively am pursuing the life I want. What a self loathing Whitney bitch way to look at life. If I don’t like it, fuck it, I’M LEAVING.

As we continued I confessed my fears of moving and being a burden. How I don’t want to tax his family like some pathetic bum. Besides I’ve never met his kids and only knew his wife from their wedding so... feels kinda weird in general. Lot of trust in a stranger from 3/4 the household based on one person’s relationship 10 years ago. Then he answered with something that I never thought I’d know but has been the focus of a very long and painful journey. In fact, I literally had to lose it all to gain what feels like everything.

He told me how his wife has her personal stiff and he went though his bouts with alcohol and depression as well. He told me that together they made it together battling each battle and celebrating each victory. He told me that he **understands that when times are the toughest all people like is really need is someone to tell them they got this.**

I broke out tears like I just did typing that sentence as the words became a new battle cry. As if all you echos became an army at my back.

*I felt my monsters and demons give pause in this relentless attack and turn attention to their leader, Alchy, who froze from the presence of something greater than all of them.*

Today is the first time in so many years that I no longer am afraid of life, finger steady over the abort bottle. The bottle is replaced with my tool box and my problems are opportunities to learn new things and then help others if they need.

Although like so, so, so many of us who have needlessly sacrificed and lost too, too much... I wouldn’t change a single thing on this journey as each part got me to a place I’m not sure I’ve ever been before. 

To me it doesn’t matter how many days in a row I’m sober as long as I keep counting them. That’s the beauty, to me at least, of having a community that **understands** one another. We all fall down but those not afflicted will insult you as they step on your head in the mud only on his own ignorance of having it when all we really need to hear “you can do this” with a hand stretched out in understanding.

And if anyone actually read through this entire thing and it made sense then that’s enough internet for now. Maybe look at a tree or something cause I know my eyes and thumbs wish I would have quit paragraphs ago, yet I wanted to make sure I told it as complete as possible to do the following:

1) Reinforce to myself the events as my reality and how though I have faltered I still see more and greater positive impact by taking taking over the helm of my life.

2) Hope it helps someone who was about to go buy booze but thought to read this first. Everything should be closed now. More importantly I saw in my tadpole days that a blog I wrote had really affected a handful of people. I never thought about getting a response but my words had done something impactful and they wanted to show gratitude. So I think it’s important to remember everything we do has impact, most in ways we’ll never know.

3) I’m using this sub the way it is going to help me. Everyone should as long as rules oblige. I’m not waiting for updoots or gilden internet praise. I’m not worried people are saying good or bad about some frog on the internet. I need to realize my thoughts and have a place I can return and review as turn new pages in life.

4) As Alfred once asked Master Bruce “Why do we fall down?” ... “To prove we can get up again”

5) And the famous Captain Taggert said “Never give up, never surrender!",4,0

I don’t feel a grandiose moment. I don’t feel like it was a big decision. On the 5th I said I wouldn’t drink until my birthday in a month. And then I didn’t say anything else. But I just know I won’t drink on my birthday either. I just ran out of whatever it was that kept that need alive.

The thing is, despite all the other problems they have, drinking and ‘can we stop by the liquor store quick’ are pretty much daily things for them. I can’t think of a day in which it was not involved. This is on top of other things that I won’t get into because I’m not part of that world (but hear stories of getting dark web stuff etc... etc...)


Anyway, has anyone dealt with an individual that you feel obligated to as a friend who just won’t let up on the drinking? This is a person who doesn’t really believe in alcoholism, is constantly in an altered state of whatever the flavor of the week is on top of alcohol. I have a lot going on and they are fully supported financially, no job or any responsibilities for that matter — no repercussions no responsibility.

2371,2020-07-07 22:09:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hn8cde/1st_spin_around_the_sun/,1st spin around the sun,"First time poster here.  I love this sub - it reminds me I'm not going at this alone and I root for everyone on here.  Tomorrow I hit my 1-year sober anniversary from alcohol.  

My story is nothing that will surprise anyone. I started drinking young (first drink at 13) and it slowly escalated.  I finally ended relationship with my abusive ex-husband (23 yrs old) but my addiction stayed with me.  A few years later (27 yrs old) I had a beautiful son with my amazing new partner (now husband) and was sober from the time I found out I was pregnant until I stopped breastfeeding.  

Alcohol innocently and slowly crept back in.  I binged on the weekend and stayed sober during the week.  I never missed work.  I was super high functional.  I started indulging a bit during the week and was surprised how well I handled it.  I had probably less than 2 hangovers my last two years of drinking.  I think my body was so used to it that it didn't phase me any longer.  Perma-poisoned.  

The last year to year and a half of my drinking I usually drank 1-2 bottles of wine a night.  Towards the end I just started buying boxed wine so I could drink as much as I wanted with no accountability.  

I drunkenly bought Naked Mind by Annie Grace one night.  I really didn't intend to quit drinking, I just wanted to moderate better.  I did dry January after reading and it went great.  Then my best friend from out of town visited and figured it was worthy of a wine celebration.  I didn't drink after that for two weeks.  Within a month I was drinking every day again.  

I finally admitted to myself that it was time to be done for good.  I finally realized there is no fucking pleasure to be had--just pain.  Just empty longing.  Just mindless numbing away of everything that makes life grand.  My son was growing up watching me be sloppy every night.  He asked me to stop--he pleaded.  My precious boy that I quit drinking for all those years ago was 8 now and well aware his mom had a problem.  I was graying out almost every time I drank.  I didn't have to even be drunk. I have wide expanses I can't recall at all.  I wasn't a crazy black-out drunk (not usually anyway), I was just checked the fuck out.  

I read Naked Mind again and decided this time it was for keeps.  1 year ago.  I have not regretted it one second since.  I've had a couple moments of self-doubt and have realized that is when it's hard--when you begin to question your decision.  And so I don't.  I 100% know stopping was the right decision for me.  I 100% know that going back is not an option.  Moderation is not an option.  Why the fuck would I want to moderate poison?  That makes it easier for me.  

I'm trying to make amends.  It's beautiful and freeing to no longer plan my life around drinking.  No more anxiety when I opened the last bottle and know it will never be enough.  I used to bring 8 damn bottles of wine on a weekend camping trip just to ensure I wouldn't run out (8!!).  I've tried to be open and honest with my son.  I've apologized for being a poor example and hearing him say he is proud of me is the only badge or medal I will ever need.  

I'm 37 years old.  It took 23 years for me to finally find my way back.  If you've read this far, thank you.  I wanted to share.  Not because I'm extraordinary or my story is unique.  Because it's NOT.  Because it's totally ordinary and hopefully relatable.  If I can do it then anyone can.  Two years ago I would have laughed in your face if you'd told me I would quit drinking.  I thought I loved it but I was just another victim.  Just another addict.  Fuck alcohol and all the lives and families and potential it has destroyed.  Life is short but days are long and the choices we make today absolutely matter.  Much love and best of luck everyone.  Timshel.",64,0

Am I going to drink? No, because this is the longest sober streak I've gone through since I was 20 and it'd be a waste to give in now.

I can't talk to my group about this - I don't want to bring them down. And I don't think any of them would quite understand the nuances of my depression. I can't talk to my best friend - we've gotten more distant over the year and honestly I don't think I like that guy any more.

I feel like I can't talk to my girlfriend for other, personal reasons.

I feel like I can't go to the IRC chat - I always feel like I'm interrupting and butting in, ruining everyone's experience.

So I am young, 23 in a few weeks, and while these days my drinking is way toned down compared to a few years ago, I still tend to drink heavily on Fridays amd Saturdays. Well this past Saturday (the 4th of July) I planned on chilling with a few beers, just a few, but we all know how that goes. The neighbors invited me over for drinks and I felt rude saying no, plus I was feeling pretty good already so why not feel even better nextdoor. They break out the shots and insist I have some. Fuck it! I’m young, i’ll worry about the suffering tomorrow. I know how this goes already and yet I can’t just say no once i’m already a few beers deep. I can’t remember the exact number of drinks I had, but I didn’t black out so tomorrow should be fine right? 

Nope. Woke up the next day feeling terrible. Hungover like usual but with an extra kick. I felt very panicky and depersonalized. When I walked to the bathroom my head felt 3 steps behind my legs. The world felt almost dream-like. So much regret. This is NOT the first time this has happened, but dammit I hope it’s the last. 

That initial hangover was Sunday morning, and now it is Tuesday afternoon and while I feel a bit better, I still keep getting the anxious, impending doom waves. My brain is still foggy and it is hard to concentrate. It reminds me of tripping, my mind just feels scattered. I know from experience these symptoms can last a few days into the week, but why the hell don’t I learn from my mistakes. This panicky restless feeling is the worst sensation I have experienced in my life. Everytime I over-indulge I send myself back to panic attack hell for a few days.

Is this a common thing with “weekend warriors”? To have a large chunk of the week ruined by rebound anxiety? I have had this post-drinking anxiety happen for a few years but it seems even worse than before. I should mention I already am diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and am on SSRIs for it. I know I really shouldn’t be drinking in the first place but it’s hard not to.",9,0

He slurred words. Staggered a bit while walking. Kept lolling his head around while getting his haircut.

I guess it made me think. I had never showed up to my course drunk or even after drinking, but it made me think of all the times I stumbled into a store anywhere from 11pm to 5am, drunk but trying to keep composure, thinking I was doing pretty good. I probably looked like that guy. We all could tell, we just didn't say anything. I suppose the store workers i've seen in my weekend binges felt largely the same way.

I felt embarrassed. Ashamed of myself, for things I havent done in a while (I think the last time I went to the store during my weekend binges was 2 years ago? I usually get what I need beforehand) and I guess I just... felt like I never wanna be that person again. A girl who gets double-take looks, who workers whisper about while she's in the store and who became a story about ""the one obviously drunk girl who tried to hide it""

It hurt me to see it. It hurt me to realize that I was likely as subtle as he was. That my feelings of ""hehehe im totally nailing this"" were most likely just the alcohol talking, telling me I was doing better than I actually was.

I felt pretty uncomfortable and kind of lame at times, because honestly I feel like most of my personality was centered around partying. 

I’m still working on navigating new social situations with no help from alcohol... so that leaves me feeling a little raw. I guess it’s just something that’s going to take practice and time. I think I’m expecting to feel amazing and totally confident over night without alcohol even though if I sit and think about it, I know that’s not the case and this is a long road. 

but on the bright side, i woke up each morning without a hangover, not puking all day like I normally would have been after binge drinking, not embarrassed, I was always ready for the day and swam my lil heart out in a beautiful clean lake the 5 days I was there. My friend even mentioned she was glad I wasn’t drinking, because she knew I’d I was, I’d be hungover and feeling sorry for myself half the trip.

Off and on attempts at staying on the bandwagon and beating myself up each time wondering what the hell was wrong with me, and why I couldn’t just “get it” already. Two rehabs for alcohol, this thing was a bitch for me.

Now I’m a week away from 7 months and almost 2 months free from cigarettes. I moved out of state in March when Covid was really hitting the fan and I can’t believe through all that I didn’t drink. I’m seriously floored that with my company offering time off, I would have all the time to have my “fuck-its” and recover before work started up, but each day was its own day and decided I liked feeling like I woke up on the right side of the bed. Some days, I felt right on the brink of slipping because it wasn’t really all that bad, right?

Long story longer, I was around the right people at the right time, and now was the perfect timing where everything fell into place and I’ve leased my first apartment all by myself(not without wailing and grinding of teeth to provide documentation make these agents happy, it’s not even that nice of a place! lol)

This afternoon, my one day off, I finished unpacking and finally had a moment to relax and breathe. Early enough in the day to get away with a bout of drinking and watching movies and pigging-out...crap, I’m still thinking about it? It wasn’t as strong of a pull as it used to be, luckily. I thought about how shitty I would feel when I would have to wake up early in the morning because I’d keep pushing the envelope and keep drinking, I’d buy another bottle the next night and so on...

I went on to cook a simple, tasty and healthy dish, all for me, cup of peach tea and a movie all alone in my little apartment,...ahh peace. Sorry for the rant, I know this isn’t my diary, but I felt so dang grateful to still be able to overcome the thoughts of refilling a glass of Jack Daniels and getting sloppy.

I’m a bartender/server with some managerial powers. Today is day 29, one month tomorrow. We had orientation, it went very smoothly. Almost too easy. 

Went upstairs to set up and clean afterwards. I noticed when I walked in a bottle of my favorite liquor (malört) was sitting in the half wall, two thirds of it gone. Other employees had been back already, t was to be expected they’ve been drinking. I forgot to mention, everyone at this job drinks pretty heavily. It was nothing to brown out at my own bar after a long Saturday shift, of course with the excuse of not eating. Never got too sloppy in front of customers, but put them down hard and strong, and hit another bar when I’d finish in hopes of getting dinner before fully blacking out. Just living the life, you know. 

I didn’t let this bottle phase me too much. Went to work deep cleaning and enjoying the company of my coworkers, whom I love and have missed so much. 
We’ve added boozy slushees to the menu and started carrying whiteclaws, which were my personal favorite last summer. So naturally, the boozy slushees have whiteclaw and vodka in them. Not only does the crew drink, but we pack a punch in our mixed drinks. Customers get their damn money’s worth. Our boss stupidly makes us clean out the slushee machines every night, you’re supposed to let them run overnight, it helps keep the consistency of the shush right. So every night, the remaining slushees get drank by employees. They emptied the test run on the whiteclaw slushee and I was offered one, I turned it down and asked for a description so I’d know what to tell customers. I was proud, and I knew what questions to ask to give a good description. I’ve got it down. 

After a little while, my best work friend asks me the hardest question of the day... 

“Do you want a baby shot?” 

I’m literally standing next to the more than half drank bottle of malört and my heart drops. My throat got tight, eyes kinda watery. 

I smiled and said no. 

I’ve tried to quit many times in the past, I’m sure before today she didn’t think I was serious, I hadn’t been before. She’s very sensitive and I doubt she’ll offer me another. 

I went outside, smoked a cigarette and ate an edible. I fucking did it, dude. I turned down my first shifty. I had snuck shots of malört in the past when I was “quitting” and always found myself right back where I started. Today I did it. I did it for me. For my future, for my family. My sanity and well-being. I’m eloping this Saturday and I’ll be damned if I live the hellish life I’ve lived for so long. My husband deserves better than that. Our animals deserve better than that. I deserve better than that. 

Tomorrow is a month. A month ago, I drank all day and fucked my life up. I almost lost everything because of fucking fernet. This month I feel like a new person, someone with purpose. I have a future ahead of me now. Friends, I wish you strength, peace and love. IWNDWYT.",6,0

It might not be an option for everyone, but for those of us who could do with some restorative alone time, I wanted to suggest going away alone.

In April (the 6 month mark), it seems like a switch clicked in my brain and finally things were falling into place, even in the middle of a pandemic. 

I've now lost a good amount of weight, I eat way healthier than I have in a long time, I exercise daily, I quit diet soda completely (this is truly insane for me), I'm getting Invisalign this week, I got my ears pierced after wanting to but being too chicken for years,...

So - what I wouldn't be able to do if I didn't get sober (I refer to my past 2 months, excluding the latest slipup 10 days ago):

\- quit unproductive therapy - I don't think I'd be able to determine whether it was actually helping me or not had I not stopped drinking. I'd be too scared to let go thinking that this is the last thing that is holding me in one piece. Now I see it was quite the opposite, I was beating myself over not making enough progress and not being able to stop drinking despite having regular sessions.

\- learn how to deal with stress - I actually learned how to separate my emotions from my work and other people's problems. How? Breathing. Remembering people who love me. Remembering that this is my life and that problem is their life. Remembering that it's just work and at the end of the day, nobody's gonna put a gun at my head if something goes wrong. And often it doesn't go wrong at all, I just tend to get irritated because as it turns out, I'm sort of a perfectionist. I do a lot and I expect the same of others - which usually is impossible to achieve. I'm learning about boundaries - both others and my own.

\- buy the very laptop I'm typing this post on - I was able to save enough money, both from not drinking and quitting unproductive therapy, to actually buy a new laptop, something I've been planning to do for a few years now.

\- progress with my projects and learning new skills - I'm actively moving forward with things I've been planning for years. Finally my ideas are starting to form. I'm not as scared to act anymore.

\- I designed my first metal band logo - I'm a graphic designer and I always wanted to get myself involved, artistically, with music industry - one way or another. But usually I'd doubt myself and then open a bottle, literally sleeping over the opportunities to do something about it. While sober my mind actively thinks more of things I really wanna or wish to do - and is more determined to actually form a plan and follow through. I'm so glad I have a chance to truly be an artist for a real music band! Damn I hope this all works out!

\- I wouldn't be hopeful. My ""big quit"" happened around the time I joined reddit, which is March 1st this year. It's been 4 months since then, with slip-ups of course, but the general cumulative effect of my efforts to quit and taste the life again has been very much true for me. The slip-ups literally don't matter to me at this point. People talk about rose-colored glasses, but I'm not sure if I ever went through this phase. I was, and I still get, very, very depressed. The downs are worse than when I was drinking, but they happen less often - and they help me reflect on the situation and on myself.

\- get back to programming, watching anime and writing stories. As for anime, especially Ancient Magus' Bride hits close to home for me. It's about a depressed teen, who sort of gets herself adopted by an ancient creature. She's so dead inside she doesn't even fear it. I have not read much about this anime, I intend to rewatch it sometime soon - in a way her coming out of her depressed shell and trying to understand her ""scary"" new reality reminds me a lot of my own struggles with alcohol and depression.

\---

Things I most certainly would still do if I were still drinking:

\- waking up tired every day - and promising myself that tonight I would not drink and that I'd go to bed early. A promise I would most likely be unable to deliver. And even if I did stop for a day or two - after I got sober it took me literally weeks to get back my energy. I was endlessly tired for over a moth, sleeping 10+ hours a day. This is how exhausted I was. I thought this was never gonna end.

\- get involved with some shady individual into some questionable relationship. I even had one on the way. I stopped it from growing and let that person go. It terrifies me, but at the same time doesn't really surprise me at all, to see that I almost chose an alcoholic partner for myself.

\- keep in touch with my alco-friends and not meeting new people. I've made some good friends over the past few months - including the one I'm waiting for as I'm typing this. I thought I'd never make a friend that would genuinely want to spend time with me. As it turns out, there are people like that out there. But I wouldn't be able to meet him if I were still this loud drink - he is a lovely, quiet person, who mostly abstains from alcohol.

\- being absolutely miserable over The Love Of My Life Who Got Engaged With Another Woman. I feel significantly better about this whole situation, but it's only thanks to me consciously processing the situation and allowing myself to let go of the hopes and dreams. It's so difficult to let go of something potentially perfect... and it's difficult to not hate the person you love when you feel hurt by them (even if it's just the situation that's difficult and it's not their fault).

\- have a mess in my room and at my place in general. I find it way easier to keep my place clean now.

\---

Thank you for reading this. If you're lurking and considering quitting, but still having a drink in your hand - it's okay. You'll get there. Keep thinking. Keep failing until you don't fail anymore. There's life, there's a new light on the horizon, even if  you can't see it now. Your life can be yours again, even if you don't believe me at the moment.

It's all okay and everything will be alright. I've never been more sure about it than today.

Don't know where to start... I've been reading most of what's been posted here for about a year and a half now. There's a lot of things that helped me stay sober, but definitly this reddit thread has been a huge, huge, huge help. I remember a year ago when I read this simple sentence '' I will not drink with you today'', something freaking popped in my head and my mindset changed. It was not about trying anymore, but choosing, no matter what (and jeez did some twisted things happened this year), that I would not let alcohol into my life... 

So, yeah... A huge shoutout, lots of love and hugs to everyone in this community. I admire every single one of you for engaging in this long process of sobriety. Doesn't matter where you are at the moment. The single act of thinking ''yeah something's wrong, i should check it out'' is courageous and full of a sense of humanity that is much needed. Or let's say... that I needed to witness.

It’s also taking time because it’s a stupid request that they don’t actually need, so it’s hard to justify to my higher ups. 

I’ve done so much for this fucking customer- negotiated with our team to get free work hours for them, fast tracked their requests, involved VPs with their account to bring visibility.

Started drinking it at like 2 pm. Drank all the way till I passed out on the couch at night (after spilling red wine all over white couch). Husband mad, not talking to me (I don't blame him). I feel like crap, physically and mentally. Guys, I am NOT doing well trying to get sober by myself. I thought I could do this on my own. I can't. I need more of a plan and I need more support. I am so disappointed in myself and I feel like a fraud and liar for committing to not drinking with all of you and then breaking my own promise. I feel like I let all of you down.

Here's what I have done today, as first steps: 

* I looked up some local AA meetings and will try to go to one today.
* I told my close friends that I need to stop drinking and that I need the wine out of my house. One of my friends is taking what is left of the wine box (thank god).

About two years ago, my doctor suggested I go on Accutane for my adult acne. She sent me to a lab for blood work, then called to tell me I needed to talk to my primary before she’d prescribe it to me because my liver enzymes were way out of whack. My primary (who I’ve since dropped) repeated the test and sent me the results and they were... Not great. Miles above normal. My doctor sent the results in snail mail with no real follow up or a call, so between that and some other bad experiences with her I decided to drop her and also, keep drinking, because my brain was still on alcoholic logic.

I haven’t had any real follow up since about it, and while I was starting to look for a new primary at the end of last year, work travel and then Covid has stopped me. So I have no idea how things have changed since.

I kept seeing my dermatologist, who’s been trying out some other options, but now she wants to revisit Accutane. Which meant a new round of blood work today.

I can’t decide how I feel. I’ve been wanting to see how my numbers look since I’ve been off the sauce for 6 months now, but now I just have a ton of anxiety. Maybe they’re better, maybe they aren’t.

We have dnd every week and there are always drinks involved. Not to the point of getting drunk but just to relax and unwind. 

The problem is that I'm a binge drinker. Whenever I drink, it’s always a very steep slippery slope to getting wasted and fueling my self-hatred and depression which gets me nowhere. I used to think that I could learn to stop hating myself every time I drink and form a healthy relationship with alcohol, but I've tried that and the negative feelings are always there, literally in the chemical makeup of the stuff. Its a depressant. 

What made me stop drinking last time was that I was raped twice in the span of one month. Once by a close friend and once by a stranger. Unfortunately, these were not isolated incidents and all of the assaults were facilitated by alcohol in some way. 

During the 5 months I was sober, I lurked on this sub and grew to appreciate the sense of community and camaraderie of everyone here. I made the deliberate choice to start drinking again at the beginning of June to see if I could make it work one more time. 

I'm here because I could not. 

I grew so much in the first 5 months of the year without drinking and as soon as I picked it back up, I immediately fell back to square one. my body hurts, I'm gaining weight, spending more money, my sleep schedule is off, and above all, the dark thoughts have returned and I'm wasting so much time. All the good habits and hobbies I'd worked so hard to cultivate fell by the wayside. 5 months of work destroyed in 1.

My wife's mother is/was an alcoholic and has been sober for about 8 years, still smokes pot though. The point being however is my drinking reminds her of how she almost lost one of the most important people in her life. 

After my party my wife was livid and I apologized again like I have before. We had just moved back to our home state, finally, after living away from friends and family. This was my big chance to get back with the friends I'd missed and reconnect with them. While the party was fun I drank too fast, didn't really connect with anyone other than party stuff and the night went out early as I'd become intoxicated and food prep and party chatter suffered.

I apologised the next day to my friends choking on the anxiety. 

I decided to take a one year break from alcohol and touch base after that point to decide what I was going to do going forward. I tried my best to analyze every situation that I was in and why I wanted to drink each time and I learned a lot.  As seemingly important as alcohol is, I not one time looked back and wished I would have drank.

For one year I thought about how I would redo my party, how much better I would be, how I would not drink as a celebration to my one year, and to show my friends and family and wife who I really am. My party would have been last weekend but due to the virus was never scheduled. A huge disappointment.

I guess you could say that my drinking ""never got that bad"" which I suppose could be argued, but I can say for sure that my life is much better now than one year ago and I feel proud of myself for this past year.

Throughout this journey I wanted to come up with advice to share, words of wisdom to pass on to you the reader. I don't really have much, there are so many great posts on here that do a better job. I will say this, things get easier, and take it one day at a time. A year seemed like forever and now here I am. 

I don't know how to wrap this up but one month in as a part of a letter to myself I wrote this: ""Please be kind to yourself on the rest of this journey, I know you can do it."" and it seems appropriate.

Always the one with the ideas, arranging the Friday end of work drinks at my place. Having the party's with exessive drinking, always to much. But I keep it with the weekend brawls and stay dry during the week. On weekdays I don't drink...I exercise a lot, starting every day with an 8K run...Before I start the workday. Sort of a ""Work hard, Live hard, Party hard""  regime.

I tell myself I earn the Friday and Saturday drinking. But this is a lie. It is a process and it can take a year. But the binge drinking gets worse and worse untill there is a black out, an accident of some sort, I fall, break my phone (I have broken dozens of phones), my glasses, my bike. And then there is regret for a while, the not drinking because this is my choise.... And then it happens again, and again, and again.

I have ""showed"" my family , my wife and children I can be sober for half a year, start of with the Dry Januari thing, and  tell my loved ones I can do this for 6 months... And I can. But, than the process just begins.....And something bad happens.... I fall, break my watch, break my phone and break my bike.

This happened to me last weekend. Went to a party, drank way to much...Understood that I was out of line, tried to get home in one piece, but crashed on my way home. 

I have had an extraordanary life, with lots of lows, but also lot's of high's. I know I have been like this all my life, before I went to some shitholes. I can be very disciplined but in this I am weak. 

Sober since 5th of July, I know I can hold this for a very long period, but I also know that I will get bored, get unmotivated, will be excersizing like a mad man. Will be a pain in the ass for my wife and kids. 

But this weekend, for the first time in my life I did admit it : I have a problem.

Actions so far: got an AA app, been reading this awesome group, talked to my SO, somehow she trust me in this (?) , talked with my kids..... 

Maybe this time it is different?

Last week I (23F) made the decision to go to the ER for help with alcohol withdrawal. I had been trying to wean off for a couple of days (after over a year of drinking at least a fifth of vodka in a day, my boyfriend and I could easily go through a handle on a weekend day when he wasn’t working). 

I’ve dealt with my mom’s severe alcoholism since I was young, and once my parents separated and I was left with her around age 7/8 I had a really rough time. I didn’t drink during high school, but at 19 I met a boyfriend who got me into drinking a lot. 

We split up for about 3 1/2 years, and eventually got back together. He has a great job, and while he drinks some evenings he has truly pulled his life together, and is incredibly supportive in my recovery. I could not be more grateful to have such an amazing partner; he is understanding and doesn’t blame me for my issues. I feel so lucky to have him. 

Anyway, at the hospital I was given fluids and other general meds, and prescribed Librium which has been a life saver. 

I know being a young alcoholic can be difficult, and at least in my case I felt a lot of fear that my issues wouldn’t be taken seriously even though I knew they were. 

I would like to encourage any younger people who are concerned about their alcohol use to reach out for help, whether it be from AA, a doctor, a family member, friend, or anyone from this sub. We are all together fighting the same struggle. 

My fight is nowhere near over, and that’s okay. I’m working on it, and we all can do the same. Day by day. Just try (and it’s okay if you don’t succeed) to do the next right thing. Sending love to all those who are in the same boat.",4,0

I'm writing this down because I think I need to, in order to have an honest conversation with myself about my substance abuse.

I am pretty sure I'm an addict. I guess I have always known this to some extent. Throughout my twenties and thirties, there have been several points where I felt like my drinking had gotten out of control. When I was 26, I became addicted to cocaine (a habit I have since kicked). I have taken molly in irresponsible and dangerous ways as well. Throughout, I have always used drinking, smoking weed, and sometimes binge eating as a way to repress my constant anxiety. 

I realized a few years ago that my ""happy place"" in terms of substance abuse is to have a drink, get high, and have a few more drinks. Recently this has become the pattern of my weeknights: get off work, have a glass of wine, smoke some weed, have a few more glasses of wine. I don't so much crave drinking/smoking as much as I feel very anxious when I don't know if I'll be drinking or smoking (which amounts to the same thing). Once I confirm that I'll have a drink, the anxiety drains away. Then it starts to build again when I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to smoke. When I confirm that I can, my anxiety dissipates. 

I know that my drinking/smoking habits are starting to bother my husband. He drinks too (and probably drinks a little too much), but I know he doesn't feel the same pull that I do. He's also not very confrontational and I don't think he'll bring it up on his own, apart from a few ""jokey"" comments now and then. This means I am constantly living with the mindset of trying to get away with what I'm doing, knowing that he doesn't like it, but unable to discipline myself to do better. 

I don't really know what to do. I have struggled with these thoughts for some time, knowing that what I REALLY want is to just cut back on my drinking and smoking without telling anyone, so that I can get healthy but still keep doing both without judgment. I think to myself, ""My drinking isn't THAT bad -- I don't ever drink during the day, I don't have withdrawal symptoms, I don't often get completely trashed, I don't go on benders, I am perfectly happy not drinking until 5 PM."" I feel like I should just be able to cut back, without making a big deal of it, without holding myself to a standard that I'll then regret setting. 

But I haven't been able to do that. Most weekday mornings, I wake up thinking, ""I don't want to drink tonight,"" but as soon as I have that thought, the anxiety about not drinking starts to set in. By 5 PM I have always decided that I should drink. I also can't substitute drinking with smoking weed like other people can, because smoking makes me want a drink even more. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking that I'll ""just"" smoke that night, but of course as soon as I do, nothing sounds better than a glass of wine or a beer. I don't do other things that make me happy -- like exercising, drawing, writing, reading, etc. -- because they are incompatible with drinking for me, and drinking takes precedence.

I keep thinking, ""Well, soon enough we'll try to get pregnant, and then I'll HAVE to stop."" But I am afraid that if I don't seriously cut back now, it might be difficult for me to stop drinking completely during pregnancy. I already feel the urge to drink or smoke in private, feeling somehow that it doesn't count if I do it secretly. I know this is a very dangerous road to walk down and I am very afraid.

My goal would be to stop drinking during the week altogether and figure out weekends from there. I don't think I want to stop drinking forever. I love having a few glasses of wine with friends on the weekends. But I do want to stop drinking as a hobby, and it's possible that involves stopping social drinking for a while as well. 

I don't want to write about this at all. I feel humiliated and angry at having to share it. But I do think I have to. What do they say? Admitting you have a problem is the first step? Well, I have a problem. I'm hopeful now I can start taking other steps to remedy it.",4,0

This is my first time posting here, but I've been subbed for a while. This is not my first time attempting to curb or stop drinking altogether.

This is motivated by a larger scale of treatment that I'm currently part of, and I could really use some support from people who understand or empathize. Heavy drinking has been a part of my life for 10 years. I truly want to quit but I somehow always self-sabotage or need to retreat to negative coping skills. 

I have been alcohol free for over 24 hours as of today, and I want to keep it going. The aspirations and goals in my life do not have room for heavy drinking, but the cravings and need to escape are sometimes too overwhelming.

If you were to bother with looking at my past posts, I had a ""dry July"" last year and felt really good about it... and several of you lovely folks encouraged pushing to two (or more) months, maybe even staying sober for good. I (stupidly) decided that I had proven to myself that I could quit if I wanted to, and that I could drink 'in moderation,' (spoiler alert: it didn't work) and I went right back to the daily drinking/ weekend benders that had caused me so much grief.in the first place. 

So, I'm back up to a little over a month now of not drinking, and I'm convinced that this time it has to be for good. But one of the things I feel like doesnt get talked about enough are the social factors involved with sobriety, especially how my friend group typically wants to spend their free time drinking and usually at bars. 

I obviously dont want to simply stop having friends- and the social distancing has been a godsend in excuses for not going out- but eventually when COVID-19 dies down, what should I do? Would a non-alcoholic beer be helpful in the social situations when my friends want to go out and I dont want to be a downer, or would this actually be counter-productive in trying to maintain my sobriety? 

TLDR: I want to stay sober and maintain my friendships, but is having a non-alcoholic beer a good idea?

I'm not sure how to better explain the feeling of relief I had than it was as if the only thing stopping me from getting plastered was that at the core of my being a necessary part of who I am is that I don't drink.

Another was weird and demonic in nature, and I was hiding under my covers begging god to save me (which is strange because I’m not exactly religious.) 

This went on until I gave up on trying. Going to my 9-5 class on 2 hours of sleep so wish me some luck! I usually come home from class and binge so today was gonna be a rough one anyway. Still I promise IWNDWYT!",1,0

It was clear as day that alcohol was causing her great harm and in the periods where she remained sober she was an all round brighter and more vital human. She could never admit she had a problem, and because of this alcohol eventually brought her to a place where she took her own life.

We were all devastated obviously, heartbroken. As frightened as I was to hear what happened, I can honestly say it wasn't a complete shock. This possibility had looming in the background for years.

I responded by drinking myself into oblivion. All day I drank by myself. When I had to go back to work I was drinking on my break, as soon as I finished I went to a corner store on my way home. I was really out of control.

Eventually, I told a friend about it. He suggested we have a bet, that way I have an excuse and some support. I was incredibly grateful for this and it did break the loop but I didn't last more than two weeks. I told myself I'll moderate but we all know how that goes, I was back to the way I had been within a week. 

I'm writing this post because I know how damaging alcohol can be for families. I want people out there to know that they're not alone and I truly empathise with their situations, however impossible they may be. I've been lurking on this sub for months and am truly grateful for all of the posts; uplifting/optimistic and heavy.

This is gonna be a long one...

Life has been throwing me a ton of lemons. I'm drowning in the ocean of lemonade I've been ""faking it til I make it"" in. Then I realized this is what happened to me the first time I tried to get sober in 2015. 


About 4 months in, I hated everything because.... well.... I didn't know why. All I knew was the pink cloud ride was over. I stayed sober for 2 years, then relapsed. I thought the horror was over, I thought I was in control again... I missed ""normal life"". And I stopped working a program of recovery from drinking.


I know, now, in 2020, that I have a chronic anxiety condition.  I needed more help back then, in 2015. The help I got lead me from antidepressants to pain pills and ultimately, right back to the bottle. Removing the alcohol didn't make the anxiety go away, it just made the anxiety harder to hide. Raw, unfiltered anxiety is no joke, it's chronic and debilitating for this Fox. It can drive one to contemplate suicide, as I've been there many times. I have found temporary relief in mmj, emphasis on temporary. And it's very limiting, as I don't drive anymore, I can't go hunting legally... I'm losing things that I loved, in order to not slip away.


I'm tired of hearing about how antidepressants, yoga, or meditation or veganism or whatever woo-woo fad du jour, is going to magically cure this chronic condition. I've been saying for a while now that the next person who flippantly offers meditation as a cure, is getting yeeted into the Delaware river. I could not practice my faith without being able to meditate, I practice as much yoga as my body will tolerate, and a life without bacon is a no go, as I get very ill if I don't eat real meats, so what else?


I want relief, I want to know what life is like as a healthy person, and am accepting that an instant cure is not the solution. I'm forever open to suggestions, and I try them if the research says it's safe, and it feels like failures, when little to no good results happen. It's a damn carousel ride and I want off! What's a Fox to do?


I'm choosing acceptance every day, as if it's the first day. It's the solution to all my problems, or so I've been told in recovery meetings... and I accept that I have chronic anxiety. I accept that this will be my life, drunk or sober. Marcus Aurelius speaks about our duty in life, our nature, and it is not to hide under our cozy blankets, but to get up and do our work. This doesn't mean I'm giving up, by writing this frustration out... it means I'm moving forward. If I wasn't sober right now, I would not be able to make the next steps, to do my duty, and for that I am grateful. Thanks for reading and letting me vent, *we're only as sick as our secrets*, after all. 


Today is a beautiful day to be alive. 

If you know why I have this mantra... see you at The Church.... And as always, much love and IWNDWYT. 💜🤘",4,0

In my experience over the last  years of my now sober life, I can say that a change of perspective can make a huge difference in dealing with sobriety.
Alcohol is not the ""lost friend"" we aren't allowed to see anymore because we have a condition called alcoholism.
Alcohol is an enemy. An enemy who tries to lure us into misery and suffering. It is a concious choice to realize that you have an enemy and to stop the enemy from entering your house (drinking alcohol again). 
Sobriety is not a burden but a gift. And by viewing alcohol as the destructive drug that it is, I stopped missing it. Why would I continue to drink poison after I have seen what it had done to me? It would ruin my finances, social life, health, carrier and basically every other aspect of life.

I wake up after drinking and feel like my partner is going to leave me , which would just destroy me. I feel I would never recover.  I'm sick of repeating this cycle.

 It should have stopped when I got into horrendous arguments with people I love, when I felt suicidal,  when i passed out in public, when I ran away from my friend on a night out and got sexually assaulted.  It didnt. I have had enough.  The thought of jeopardizing my relationship is more than I can bear.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

******************************************




Goooood morning everyone! We made it to Tuesday in one piece!

For today, I'd like to share a perspective that, although simple, has been really turning my attitude around lately.

As my girlfriend and I sing (badly) in the car together, I keep finding out that I've had the lyrics wrong for *years*! Songs that I love, that I sing all the time! It's kind of funny how sure I was that I had the words correct, and I never questioned it until now.

I realized that, similarly to the words of the song, I was so sure about drinking; my life would *clearly* be worse if I didn't drink, right? Every hangover was because I didn't eat enough, or because I didn't drink enough water, never just because I drank. Unlike the song lyrics, this was a critical mistake of course, and I'm glad to have heard this song the way it's really sung.

From mishearing song lyrics to drinking, I thought about how we can be so incredibly far off from the truth and be completely oblivious. Being right is by no means the most important thing ever, but being wrong could mean slight embarrassment, or it can mean literally risking your life.

One thing I've learned from all this is that certainty does *not* equate to being right, and usually it in fact is stronger in people who have it wrong. This was a humbling idea to me, and I have been keeping this in mind as much as possible. Now whenever I feel so certain, a red flag goes up and that's my signal to check myself (before I wreck myself - sorry I had to!) This doesn't mean I'm constantly second-guessing myself and undermining my confidence in myself, just simply making sure I'm not stuck in a blind belief.

I invite you to start questioning yourself and asking every once in a while 'what if I'm wrong about this?' I'm hoping you'll find, as I did, that I'm wrong about a whole lot in my life! And that's a beautiful thing, because being wrong all the time means you're learning and improving all the time. I'd like to hear about a time that you were *so* 100% certain about something, and it turned out you were so 100% wrong, and how things/your perspective changed after that. 

Happy Tuesday everyone 😊🙏",236,0

When I drank 31 days ago it was after 30 days of not drinking so in the last 60 days I have drank twice. When I drank a month ago I started with a six pack and went to whiskey. I drank enough whiskey to make me extremely sick and overwhelmingly depressed. Yesterday I drank four beers and a shot. I’m depressed right now but nothing compares to last time. Yesterday I just gave in after I was done moving my 23 year old daughter(my little girl) to her first real apartment. I was frustrated. I thought being sober for a month would greatly improve my depression. It got better but I was still having crying spells several times a day. So I said fuck it  and decided to see what I had been missing. I found out I wasn’t missing much. The good thing is that I’m not going to beat myself up but that’s easier said than done  That doesn’t mean I’m not struggling because I am. I’m looking forward to not drinking today so I can relieve some guilt. I’m writing this at 3 AM while lying in bed by myself crying. The good thing is I’ve felt a lot worse in the past and not drinking today should not be too difficult. I guess that’s some progress. I know things can get better because I have read so many success stories here . I feel better after rambling on. Thanks for listening. IWNDWYT.",13,0

She's trying to take me to the cleaners for a bunch of other stuff too but that in particular is just a low blow.

I have a very loving and supportive girlfriend who somehow puts up with all the craziness, and I have my family who I know will always be there.

It's the first morning of my holiday in Cornwall, and I feel so at peace. My boyfriend and I had a long day of driving from London yesterday, and I was really able to enjoy the ride, not waiting for when we *finally* got to the pub. When we finally arrived yesterday, I had a NA beer with my dinner and a really good sleep when we got to the AirBnb. 

This morning, the sun woke me up at 6:30. We have a sky light in our room, and the sun was SO bright. Had I been hungover, that would have pissed me right off. But I wasn't hungover. I maybe didn't get my usual 8 hours, but I actually felt excited and energised, so I slipped out of bed and tiptoed to the back garden with my yoga mat.

I had an hourlong practice as the sun climbed higher in the sky, waking this sleepy part of the world. Birds and squirrels watched curiously as I moved through my poses, and as I gazed up at the clear blue sky in a backbend, I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude. Not drinking has made my life immeasurably better. Here I am, ALIVE, enjoying the simple pleasure of fresh coffee and the morning air. There's no nausea, headache, or grogginess to cloud this experience. I don't have to worry about wasting time hungover on my holiday, or worrying if I will be too shaky to keep up with my boyfriend on the hikes. I am HERE, I am PRESENT, I am living my life.

My heart is so full right now. There is no room for alcohol anymore.

No one knows the extent of my drinking. 

While I was in college i was getting drunk around 3 nights a week, which was kinda normal because college. 

When we went on spring break, I had a little bender and I just never really stopped. Waking up early for school or a job didn’t hinder me anymore, so I just thought, why not? 

I’ve been drinking almost every night for the past few months. This week I went two days without drinking and it felt like a huge accomplishment, so the next day I celebrated by getting drunk two nights in a row. The only time I usually don’t get drunk is when I’m with my boyfriend, ill usually have one or two, because I don’t want him to know how bad I am. He’s even caught me drinking before I came to see him because I was so anxious. 

Last night I got so drunk that I didn’t wake up for the first day of class. Really? I couldn’t moderate one night?

When I start drinking, I can’t stop. I just want more. After I have like 3, it’s all over. I attempt to moderate by buying one drink at the gas station, then I’ll even go as far as stealing other people’s alcohol, my roommates, or friends. 

I realize that I have a problem and I need to do something about it. But I can’t accept that I’ll never drink again. I have extreme anxiety and it’s the only time I feel free. It’s the only time I feel like I can open up and be myself, especially around new friends. I want to drink all the time. I’m just always uncomfortable and anxious, and alcohol helps me feel better. I also have really extreme insomnia, sometimes I just can’t sleep for days. 

I know that most people are pretty adamant that you have to just completely give it up, but is there a way I can change my relationship with alcohol? If I were to strictly give it up unless I’m going out with friends? 

I’m really new to this, and only now coming to accept that I have a problem, so any advice is appreciated. Thank you.

I [37M] had my last drink last Sunday after realising that alcohol was no longer providing more positives than negatives. I wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic although am definitely somebody who would automatically have a drink to celebrate/relax/try to solve my life's problems.

Pre-lockdown I would probably drink 4-5 days/nights per week but after being furloughed and not having to go into work since the start of April this had increased to pretty much every day. If I had beers left in the fridge from the day before, I would certainly be opening them before lunch the next day. 

My realisation came when I noticed myself being quite moody when speaking to my friends during a weekly online quiz we do. I'm usually quite a lively person but just felt like I didn't want to participate and knew it was down to the stress of not working and the consistent drinking so decided to take a few days off whilst getting back into self-improvement.

Since last Sunday I've read 5 books from start to finish (prior to this I had probably only finished one book in the last year). Two of these were books on being sober curious or alcohol free. I feel that my focus is a lot better and I'm not lazily avoiding the basic jobs around the house and leaving them to my fiancee. Not only that, with a wedding to prepare for next year I need to be a lot better with my finances to pay for it!

I'm not saying I will never have a drink again so will call myself sober curious, but feel very good right now having not drank for 9 days and have no desire to change it for the foreseeable future.

I'm a 27 year old male, have been over drinking for a long time now. 

I'm actually quite introverted and when I was in my teens it was a way to become more extroverted. I thought there was something radically wrong with me, something that needed to be fixed, so I began taking my social medication. That's where the problem began.

I drank all through university. At the time I didn't seem to be much different than the other students on the outside, although I frequently got black out drunk. 

When I finished university I lost the little frame I had, this is when I began drinking all of the time. 

I've let great opportunities and relationships slip through my fingers because I essentially had my head up my own ass. 

I quit at the start of the year and it lasted about two months. I then moved to a new country and I said I'll go out once or twice just to meet people, fast forward four months and most of my time here has been a blur. I came to change my ways but I've just brought them with me really.

I want to reinvent myself and become the person I'm supposed to be, not the drunk overgrown teenager I have been.

It's been a busy mofo of a summer for me between quitting my job, packing up and selling my house, then moving across the country. I have been slogging through *Shogun* throughout this whole thing and am still, STILL not done with it! I've been at 99% for about 3 days now so I must be close, but boy howdy it's a long one. It has very little to say about sobriety or alcohol and has been a pure ""for the hell of it"" read. It's pretty great but I wish I had read it in calmer times and in paper book form rather than on Kindle. I kept wishing I could just flip back to certain sections. Lots to keep up with. 

So as for quit lit and the sober life-- I've found myself tempted to be honest. I'm back in Reno, Nevada, which is probably the town I love most in the world, but it is full of temptations. Not only the old favorite haunts and knowing I could easily meet up with the old drinking crowd at one of these, which I expected to be a challenge, but just the ubiquity of booze is unsettling me. I got sober in Minnesota, where at least there's no ""real"" alcohol except at liquor stores and licensed restaurants and bars. Here it's in your face at Costco, at the grocery store, at Walgreens. Or rather, it's in the background if only I could tune it out. And I will. 

Although I've never been to AA or done step work, when I find myself feeling challenged in my sobriety, it's always Russell Brand's *Recovery* that I return to like a sacred text to comfort me through. I liked this section in particular over the weekend when I was feeling testy:

""At times like these, addiction does not come as an enemy but like a mob boss, as an old friend. It places its familiar arm heavily around you and your eyes roll back."" A few pages later, he says of working an AA program ""we decided to watch for those old patterns and nip them in the bud when they came up. That is where we find ourselves now, ready for a different kind of inner life."" I didn't ""do the work"" but this really resonates with me just the same. I've done my own sort of work and know that my new inner life is superior to the old ways and that the bottles on the endcaps at Safeway can't hurt me if I don't reach out for them. 

So what are you guys reading or watching or hearing this summer?

It would be my third try and has turned out to the best so far. I'm extremely thankful to have found this sub a couple years ago and that you great people were around when stars aligned for another push. Over these couple years, I learned a ton about addiction, accepted that it is really really really difficult to control, and could trace many of my own regrets to drinking. I knew I had to get over the initial urges to drink and get on with other positive things like meditation, reading, exercise but most of all keep coming back and investing time in the idea of sobriety. I now feel great about the direction things are going.

It's hard to describe how good it feels to be sober. It's more a part of me than I expected and so much better than whatever temporary high came from booze. I'm working on losing weight and have reached a new best in terms of daily exercise.

Thank to all of you for posting your stories, sharing such personal struggles, and for reading my ramblings. I wish the whole internet could be as honest and supportive as this sub.

So, I had stopped drinking for the most part January - March, then quarantine bitch slapped me and I went back into old habits. Drinking after work, basically binging, and a good amount on weekends. I know this obviously is not good; I had stopped drinking bc I was getting fatty liver (drinking but also overweight in general, need to get it together in terms of working out and sugar as well). 

I'm trying to snap back out of it. Big wakeup call today was going to an obgyn (completely unrelated, well women's exam) and when she mentioned a urine test for liver/kidney function I just thought, ""oh crap do i even want to know...?"".  Obviously I need to. I don't know why this wasn't a bigger focus. I'm nervous to see results but regardless of me knowing or not knowing the exact numbers, it is still an issue. 

Not sure how to actually get what I *intellectually* know to sink into what I *actually* do.  Not sure if I'm making sense...  any advice?  Do I need to start journaling?  Get a counselor?  What has helped you?

Edit: Thank you all!  Got some really scary numbers for my ALT and AST.  No question I was drinking too much even though it didn't affect my personal life etc; it's clear in the numbers. Also clear that I'm technically overweight (closer to obese) and my trash eating, not working out, working nights and chugging energy drinks and tylenol/aspirin for the times graveyard shift bitch slapped me did no good.  

I am 10 days sober and too scared to go in for an ultrasound my doctor recommended. So instead, I plan to go 30 days sober, go back in, get my levels rechecked, and no matter what get the ultrasound then. I am also eating cleaner (less fast food), trying to walk close to 10k steps a day, and cutting out energy drinks and soda and tylenol/aspirin along with no alcohol. We will see!!!",9,1

Christmas night 2019 after an alcoholic mother to an alcoholic son heart to heart...( while drunk, of course) I decided I needed to stop drinking . I was hoping I could help my son , age 38, see the way, get help or do whatever he had to do to get out from under what he called a “ curse”. You see, my son’s health was failing...very overweight, alcoholic, up against our genetic curse. COVID-19 forced him to work from home...no reason to sober up now. I begged and pleaded from across the country for him to seek help. He couldn’t eat and he had trouble breathing The stubborn, hide everything nature of his alcoholism stopped him from doing that.  On June 1 after not being able to reach him for 24 hours ( which was very unusual), I got a call from the coroner in California. My 38 year old son had died of cardiac arrest the day before, while finally trying seek some help. I truly lost my best friend. I have remained sober throughout this unimaginable pain. I’m doing it for him . I’m doing it for me. Alcohol has taken so much from me and it’s not going to be my curse anymore. RIP my sweet, firstborn son. IWNDWYT .",1548,1

What started for me as a temporary cut back feels like something much bigger.  I'm hesitant to put a label on it, but I've had a huge shift in the way I think about alcohol over the last month and I think this is permanent.  

It's been a rough year for many of the obvious reasons and also for many deeply personal ones which meant a lot of drinking for me for the first half of the year.  I started listening to This Naked Mind last month and it finally clicked for me that I can be addicted to alcohol without being the stereotypical ""alcoholic"", it's just not a popular concept in our culture that there is a spectrum of ever advancing addiction that people progress along differently.  

I've always said that I don't want to be like my partner's extended family that has several drinks every single day and I realized that I'm really not that far off from that at this point and I'm only 30.  I also realized what a lie to myself it was every time I told myself it would just be one drink.  Not that that I was getting belligerent every day, but it was rarely ever just 1 drink anymore.

Spent 4th of July with a couple of friends and everyone drank except for me and for the first time I didn't feel like I was missing out.  Like I said, something big has shifted in my brain which I home continues after quarantine life.

My biggest concern right now is my husband.  He and his whole family has a culture of normalized heavy drinking which is frustrating for it's own reasons, but I worry about the conversation we will eventually have when he realizes that this isn't just a temporary thing for me (we haven't discussed it directly, but I've also being dieting and so he just assumes this is part of that).  I feel like I know what I want but I'm not ready to have a conversation with other people and be forced to ""justify"" what I'm doing.  I'm thinking of just keeping my explanation simple which is that this is what my body needs right now.  The secret being that I'm fairly confident that it will continue to be what it needs forever.  Any thoughts/tips on how to approach this without creating an air of judgement?

I have come to visit once again.
I love to see you suffer mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially. I want to make you restless so you can never relax. I want to make you jumpy and nervous and anxious. I want to make you agitated and irritable so everything and everybody makes you uncomfortable.
I want you to be confused and depressed so that you can’t think clearly and positively. I want to make you hate everything and everybody, especially yourself.
I want you to feel guilty and remorseful for the things you have done in the past that you’ll never be able to let go of. I want to make you angry and hateful toward the world for the way it is and the way you are.
I want you to feel sorry for yourself and blame everything but ME for the way things are.
I want you to be deceitful and untrustworthy, and to manipulate and con as many people as possible. I want to make you fearful and paranoid for no reason at all. I want to make you wake up during all hours of the night screaming for me. You know you can’t sleep without me. I’m even in your dreams.
I want to be the first thing you think about every morning and the last thing you think about before you black out. I’d rather kill you, but I’d be happy enough to put you back in the hospital, another institution or jail.
But you know I’ll be waiting for you when you get out. I love to watch you slowly go insane. I love to see all the physical damage that I’m causing you. I can’t help but chuckle when you shiver and shake, freeze and sweat at the same time.
It’s amusing to watch you ignore yourself, not eating, not sleeping, and not even attending to your personal hygiene.
Yes, it’s amazing how much destruction I can be to your internal organs while at the same time working on your brain, destroying it bit by bit.
I deeply appreciate how much you are sacrificing for me. The countless good jobs you have given up for me, all the friends whom you deeply cared for you gave up for me. And what’s more, the ones you turned yourself against because of your inexcusable action.
I am eternally grateful, especially for the loved ones, family and most important people in the world that you have turned yourself against. You threw even them away for me. I cannot express in words the gratitude I have for the loyalty you have for me. You sacrificed all these beautiful things in life just to devote yourself completely to me.
But do not despair my friend, for on me you can always depend. After you have lost all these things, you can still depend on me to take even more. You can depend on me to keep you in a living hell, to keep your mind, body and soul. For I will not be satisfied until you are dead, my friend.
Forever yours,Your Addiction",18,0

I’m an alcoholic, I’ve been one for a while, and it has always been coupled with other things, the most prominent being weed. Im extremely proud to say that I’ve been alcohol free for over 3 months now, but my good intentions have only stretched so far, as I have continued daily/almost constant marijuana use. I’ve abused both substances pretty consistently since high school, I’m 25 now.  
Weed is beyond a crutch. I’ve taken breaks before from it successfully, but this time is so much scarier because this one feels like the real deal. I’m afraid of life without weed. 
I watch a lot of comedy, more recently a good amount of Theo Von, and I gotta say, I know it may seem stupid, but the dude has just really inspired me. I’ve always thought I didn’t want to try actual programs, and that I wanted to do it on my own, but I feel like it may just not be enough to really seal the deal. It’s hard to imagine life without being on something. 

I’m sorry that was so long, thanks for sticking with me, my questions are these:
Where do I go? I know there’s AA and MA, although I’m struggling with marijuana use, I have absolutely been through the ringer with alcoholism, and I know it’s something I will always live with. 
Can I go to AA even though my focus right now isn’t actually getting off of alcohol? I have no idea how these things work
I’m also not religious, and it can make me pretty uncomfortable as my family is pretty heavy handed with that stuff, but I know I’m capable appreciating it and understanding it’s lessons, so how will that play into 12 step stuff?

Have been a drinker most of my adult life (52) now. The last year has been a struggle for me. My drinking has really gotten out of hand. My family has confronted me,they have encouraged me,they have been supportive. Time after time I have disappointed them.Six months ago they took me to rehab, I was there for a went and them did group counseling for 9 weeks.But honestly I was just going through the motions and didn’t really open up and never made an honest attempt at stopping. The lure of the alcohol was so strong, I felt I needed it, some days I just wanted it. I have lied about my drinking, hidden bottles around the house. My family would always find out. They have asked me time and again to just be open and honest but rather than coming forward, I would continue to hide the drinking. I’m afraid I have caused some very deep riffs in our relationships and not sure if they will ever be able to forgive me. For me to be open and honest would mean admitting to myself that I had a drinking problem. This past week was really bad and my husband asked me to leave, So I did and spent the first few days drinking to just try and forget and feeling sorry for myself.After a few days of not drinking and just feeling sorry for myself,I considered suicide just to make it all go away and I wouldn’t have to deal with my problem or face the reality of how bad my problems with alcohol are. Thankfully,I didn’t ,I decided I didn’t want to die and I have a life worth living and family that I want to be a part of that life. For the first time ,in perhaps in forever, I can say I don’t want a drink. I am starting therapy one on one , going to give meetings a try-an be open. I know I am just at the beginning of my path and it will be a life long struggle. I am not even sure of all the options and choices that are available but I am hopeful that I find my way.  I don’t want to be this drunken liar that I have allowed myself to become. I struggle with finding the words, I am not good at expressing myself and feeling vulnerable.but for the sake of myself and my loved ones, I have to be.",2,0

Hello, everybody. Today is day 14 for me(despite the flair) .  I thought I'd try and show something that's useful and has helped me a lot. I recently read the book ""drink"" by Professor David Nutt and I recommend it highly. There's another one called ""alcohol explained"" , which is also really good. 

So first a little bit of (hopefully relevant) background. I smoked cigarettes for about eight years, and eventually I was able to quit because I convinced myself that they weren't doing anything for me. And so once I did that and I got out of the habit, I was fairly quickly able to give it up. But I've been a heavy drinker for let's say 20 years(I'm nearly 40,now) because I could never get past the fact that if I had a drink I would immediately feel better and there's this obvious positive thing to it. 

My sister was a cocaine addict for 20 years and I thought she was crazy because plainly it'll give you a little bump but then you'll be come down and it be worse off than when you started - a little bump, but when that wears off you're worse than when you started so it's a losing game that spirals downward crazily. I never recognized it as the same as drinking. Let me give you a little bit of the science.  I'm no expert, but I think the gist is correct and that's all we need here. There are incredible people lurking in this sub(including you!), so hopefully someone in the comments will elaborate or correct any serious errors. 

The main thing in your brain... Let's called it a chemical, but that's probably not the correct term.. A hormone? . I forget, but it's called glutamate and it's the thing that keeps you awake. And let's call it the positive thing here - the upper. The other thing I want to talk to you about is gaba . That's the thing that relaxes you and can also make you go to sleep. So when you have a drink and you start to feel more relaxed, that's the gaba level in your head affecting your brain set up. I'm intentionally phrasing this as simply as possible. Why do you pass out? Too much gaba (at least partly). 

So here's where it gets interesting- because you obviously all know what the effects of alcohol are when you regularly have that gaba influence every evening- your brain learns to predict it and so it because it's trying to maintain equilibrium because your brain's not supposed to have this downer poison, your brain will release a lot of glutamate. An upper. This is why,  once you're a well-established heavy drinker, you can drink a lot:  your brain is expecting it and it compensates. This is also why when you stop drinking and it gets to like 6 p.m. or whenever it is for you, you get super anxious because your brains are releasing that glutamate(stimulant) expecting the gaba(depressant) to knock you down. So anyway all I wanted to say with this to try and give you a bit of an insight is that you've got this natural equilibrium and all the times when you think of alcohol as positive, actually, it's just restoring you back.

 I remember my dad sitting on a sofa, stubbing out a cigarette, saying don't smoke-all it really does is stop you wanting a cigarette. I'd never put two and two together to realize that when I was drinking what it was doing with removing the anxiety caused by the excess glutamate because my brain was expecting the gaba. If you, like me, have drunk to remove anxiety, please trust me when I tell you that alcohol is making your anxiety worse, even if it removes it temporarily. Ride it out for a few days and I promise you that the anxiety gets better. 

I hope this is useful and you're all okay. No matter how much you're struggling, if you're here it's because you are brave and fighting to do what you think is right, and for that you have my admiration. The world needs more people willing to do the hard, correct things. That's why we need you, no matter how low your current view of yourself may be, and that's why I will not drink with you today.

 Good luck.",7,0

I've honestly been looking forward to this Monday because I'm usually recovering from the weekend and was thinking I'd wake up rejuvenated this time. However, I instead woke up anxious for all the work I have to do this week, guilty for not doing work as planned over the weekend, and depressed from the overwhelming feeling of it all.

I guess I assumed since I wasn't drinking and wasting time that way, that my life would turn around instantly. Rationally, I know that's not true. Even though I didn't drink, I still didn't spend my time productively at all this weekend. It seems I often drink to avoid the stress and anxiety of work/school, but I apparently still avoided all of this even without booze. So today I'm starting the day with these intense feelings, when usually the alcohol suppresses them or at least I'm so hungover that I can only focus on nursing the hangover and nothing else.

I guess what I'm realizing today is that stopping drinking is only the first (major) step in getting my life where I want it to be. To get it there, I'm going to have to do a lot more than stop drinking, but I know if I were to continue drinking I wouldn't be able to take those other steps. I guess after all the instant gratification that alcohol provides, it's a slightly overwhelming and discouraging realization that everything won't instantly improve just by cutting out the booze.

As overwhelming as it all feels right now, I know I'm heading in the right direction and I'm going to stick with it. IWNDWYT.",61,0

It wasn't consistent but for the most part I was sober. Then I found out I was pregnant with our first baby. So, of course the drinking stopped immediately. Six weeks into the pregnancy I lost the baby. I had never felt so much pain and heartache in my whole life, which I'm grateful for but it also made it even harder to deal with this loss. I wanted to drink again so badly, but I continued to stay sober in honor of that baby. Then, I immediately got pregnant again, and this one stuck. 

The Pregnancy goes on, and it was a great experience. I loved being sober. Not to say it wasn't hard, it was, especially when I was bored or everyone else around me was drunk. But it was wonderful not feeling hung over with them the next morning, and to watch myself become the person I believed I could be. 

Then one day, late into my 38th week, my 6yo dachshund, Piper, hurt her back. We spent all night in the back of my husband's 4runner while she was in the emergency vet. I couldn't sleep at all that night while we waited for the vet to let us know if surgery could save her. The worst part was this was during the Pandemic so we couldn't even go inside the building where I could be with her. I know she was scared. I've never seen her as scared as she was when her back went out. I wanted so badly to be in there with her and to hold her. 

The next morning the vet confirmed that the only way to save her was a $10k surgery, and even then they couldn't guarantee quality of life. My heart dropped. Piper was my baby girl. I always jokingly called her my first born. I felt sick to my stomach, but we didn't have a choice, we couldn't afford the surgery and the rehab she would need, especially when I was going to give birth at any minute. So, we brought her home, spoiled her with all her favorite foods, and spent our last few hours with her before we had someone come to the house and put her to sleep. My baby girl took her last breath in my arms. 

That was the worst day of my entire life. Losing her was harder than miscarrying my first baby. That first night without her was horrible. I barely slept, and I'd wake up sobbing. Then at 530a my contractions started. I was not mentally prepared to give birth, but I had no choice. That day was so tough. I was dehydrated from not eating or drinking the last two days and it made the contractions so incredibly painful, and because of the Pandemic my husband couldn't even be in the room with me until hours later when they finally admitted me (around 2p). 

Anyway, I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, and we are so grateful for how wonderful and healthy he is. But I've had to also deal with losing Piper while now raising a newborn. It hasn't been easy. About 5 weeks in I started drinking again. That was 6 weeks ago. I've decided to try and quit again. But I know it's going to be so incredibly hard because I'm having to face all these emotions head on instead of hiding behind the bottle. 

I'm scared of everything right now. I'm scared of how hard this is going to be. I'm scared of facing life without her. Idk. I don't know if posting my story here will help me at all. But I figured spelling it out is a good start, even if it means I'm sobbing while I nurse my son and write this. Wish me luck, I guess?




TLDR: I got sober after miscarrying my first baby. Then I got pregnant again and the day before I gave birth I had to put my 6yo dachshund to sleep. She was my ""first born"" and the loss has been unimaginable. Then I gave birth during the Pandemic, and I've been trying to deal with losing her and raising this new baby. I started drinking again, and now I'm trying to quit. Wish me luck.",7,4

I've also noticed people I drink with regularly are now doing ketamin which I've tried once with them. Alcohol is something I will do regardless. The other substances I just dabble with when they are there. I know alcohol is my biggest problem. I just want my life back. I want me back. All the money spent, time wasted, opportunities lost.

It's crazy because I talk to my friends and my mum who drinks a bottle of wine a night about this and they all just normalize it. Saying I'm young still and everyone does it. But something doesn't feel right about it to me. Sometimes out there it feels like I'm truly alone in this struggle. I'm thankful for finding this sub.

I do struggle with giving up. The most I've ever gone in a long time is a week. But then I'm right back. Tbh I tried to give up last week, three times. After a huge bender on Friday and walking in my door at 8am after drinking from 4pm the previous day. I suffered but promised this was it. Next day which was yesterday. I was feeling better but I promised I would not go back to it. I spoke to a trusted friend about my problem and they really gave me good advice and had me feeling like one day at a time and I could do it. Well I was wrong. I went out for a bike ride. A friend called and asked to join. Immediately I refused and said I don't want to see anyone who I drink with. My friends are aware I struggle with the drink where they seem less concerned about stopping. He reassured me that we wouldn't drink and stay sober. That lasted about 1 hour. I'm not blaming my friend because I could of said no. But God I had a feeling in my bones I should of not met him. I drank all afternoon again and into the the night. I'm not feeling too bad at the moment but I fucked up again and I know it. Something has to give. There has to be a change. I just need to be stronger. Sometimes it feels impossible to quit. Today I won't drink. Tomorrow I'll think of it. Then I'll probably crack on Wednesday/Tuesday. This seems to be my ritual. 

I feel like I've let my friend down so much who was giving me support and listening to me. They text me whilst I was out drinking and I couldn't reply due to the shame. I haven't told them I didn't even make it a day I'm so embarrassed.

I read through the posts on here seeing some of you reach your milestones. It makes me feel so good to know that others understand my pain and are breaking free from this spell. I cant even go three days anymore but I'll keep trying and get there. I do feel like if I'm struggling here how will I avoid a relapse at day 12, day 50 or year 2. Will dating be the same? Will I have to give up these friends that enable me. Do I change number and go ghost. I read it's a different path for everyone. I'll just have to find mine. Wish me luck and thanks for all of your stories. I won't drink today.",5,0

I posted about being drink free for 57 hours a few days ago, because I was counting it in hours. Then I started counting days. Now I can count a week. I’m so happy - I always make sure I am home by 3-4pm at the weekend so things don’t intrude on my drinking routine. On a Sunday I would often drink from 3-4pm. Yesterday I went for a walk on the beach, 30mins from my home, at 4pm.

But last night I had a dream that I had been drinking. I had not drank loads, but I was drunk. I got in my car and I got lost. When I pulled over there were people I know or have known and they got in my car and were questioning if I had been drinking. I was getting angry with them and telling them to get out of my car, but they wouldn’t and kept pushing me that I was drink driving, but I just got madder and madder with them. They got out and I realised I was drunk!

I didn’t used to drink drive and some of the people in my dream I haven’t seen for many years - but I guess it was my mind telling me something?! Maybe driving at 5-6pm on a Sunday freaked my mind out?

Last night was a mile stone. I met a new male friend and hung out with him all night talking about everything. Mostly sharing stories about our bad deeds. The whole time he was drinking and smoking weed. In the morning around 7am. He said to me something I want to hear more and more, he said. ""I'm impressed in your ability to resist doing or drink anything all night"" 

Warmed my heart. Little does he know I wasn't resisting anything. I don't want that stuff anymore. Like a member said to me (don't know if he wants to get name dropped, I'm still new) but he said. ""It doesn't matter if it's day 1 day 5 day 5,000. What matters is if you remember why you quit."" So I do. I think about it every night and every night I'm so happy to be sober.

Okay enough happy news, I do have a problem and want to reach out. My ~~fiance~~ my ex was texting me when I was going through withdrawals. She was convinced I cheated just because I hung out with an ex on my birthday. Previously to that I told her how ridiculous that was, seeing as how our sex life was fantastic. Yet when I was entering hell and she pressured me saying ""admit you cheated or I'm done.""

Well.... I wasn't in my right mind, so I just went along with it. Then she promptly disowned me thinking I fucked my ex. Classic mistake on my part. Never say something just to let them be right, I mean when they are wrong.

Ugh.... its been 9 days now. I sent poetry, cake in a box. Took time to deeply thank her for all of her help. I think I'm blocked. 

What do I do? I had the wedding set up. The priest is wondering what is going on. Like now she won't open a snap chat from me. Im worried she's got it in her head that I fucked this ex and thus has to go fuck someone to get over me. Its a little hard to focus guys.

Hey that still isn't a reason to drink though! Just wanting your thoughts. Thanks for the read.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Over the weekend I moved to a much larger and much nicer place to be closer to work.

Since I got a psychiatrist to help manage my medication, we planned on me taking this for 2 weeks to monitor my drinking. I decided not to take it, and drank less than I have before. Still drank relatively regularly, but less of the hard stuff. So I decided to start Naltrexone this weekend since I’m afraid it might compromise my sobriety.

And the first 2 days I feel ashamed to say I did smoke/drink before I took it.

I know I’m not helping myself... I think I might be ready. I haven’t felt depression in a long time but it kept me in check and I didn’t have those cravings. 

I’m wondering if I’m supposed to rely on this, or really just quit. I can’t keep going back and forth. My life significantly improves when I quit. I need help. I’m scared of taking the medication but I’m also scared I’ll never be able to do this on my own.

It was a wake up call that my friends drink too much, there’s no cut off and no one paces themselves it seems. 

I remember everything, I had some great conversations, I drove home last night and didn’t have to worry about something bad happening. A friend told me I look better already since I quit. I was able to wear shorts I couldn’t wear in May bc I was so bloated from drinking. 

Although my hubby got too drunk today, I didn’t. He cried bc he felt bad. He was ashamed of himself for not stopping. I can’t make him quit or control his habit, but I can lead by example. I got him Gatorade, made him drink water and eat crackers. He’s asleep on his side and I keep checking his breathing bc I’m a paranoid motherly freak lol. But I’m glad that I’m not drunk, passed out next to him. He wants to get help, and we’re working towards that step by step. He needs a therapist, we don’t have insurance (yay ‘Murica) and I’m not back to work yet. But this week I go back and my first priority is getting him in to see someone.

I’m writing on here again today as I would like to thank the horrible ordeal we are going through right now for completely erasing my social life and as such helping me have less reasons to drink.

In the past 4 months I have never once gotten drunk. I drank sometimes in small amounts. I drank at home, but at most it was either half a beer, or a bit of wine or a sip of liquor for taste. I graduated this year so I had a few certain moments of celebration these past few months, yet I never felt this desire to get smashed or numb myself out with alcohol (even when I was very stressed or sad).

Ok, I lied. I did actually have that desire a few times, yet it felt so pointless to get drunk. After about 2 months of no hangovers, no embarassing drunk incidents, no next-day regrets, no drunk texting, and an overall better feeling about myself and my body I was totally convinced that sobriety is the way for me and that quitting alcohol for good will improve the quality of my life to an unimaginable extent.

I haven’t had a hangover in 4 months and my god life is so amazing without hangovers. Everyone tells you so but honestly I feel like a part of me that I thought was gone resurfaced and now it’s like I am so much more in tune with myself. And that’s crazy for me. I genuinely feel like alcohol clouded a big chunk of my identity and made me become someone I was not and by quitting it I am starting to see myself clearly again.

I am still sad and anxious and lonely and all that, but I fully realize that alcohol will never help me with these issues and whatever “help” I felt that it gave me in the past was just a big fucking lie. 

I am also trying to forgive myself everyday for my drunk mistakes as I still get a lot of intrusive thoughts of certain memories of things I have done or said while under the influence even if they are from like 1-2 years ago. I still feel a lot of shame from nights I have no recollection of but generally I am aiming to be grateful that I can change for the better.

I wish everyone on here a lot of luck in their journey to full or partial sobriety, or whatever fits you best. It’s one of the hardest things ever but I  deeply and truly believe in all of us!",3,0

Both of my parents are alcoholics in denial. Some of my most vivid childhood memories include the smell of my mom’s liquor on her breath. But I would be different than that. It’s what I told myself as my alcohol consumption slowly started to increase. But I wasn’t as bad as my parents, so I didn’t need to stop. 

My sister admitted to me that whenever she drinks, she loses control and gets blackout drunk. But I didn’t get blackout drunk, so I didn’t need to stop. 

My best friend admitted to me that I get real mean when I’m drunk. Solution: I’ll just drink by myself! Problem solved, so I didn’t need to stop. 

I’ve had to move back in with my parents after college and my drinking got more intense, but I still wasn’t as bad as them so did I really have to stop? It’s not the first time I doubted my own reasoning, but for some reason this time my doubts were stronger than my denial. 

Finally, I walked in on my dad, alone, chugging a handle of vodka on the couch. And it finally hit me like a sack of bricks. I was staring at my future if I couldn’t get this under control. I wasn’t a raging alcoholic, not yet, but the way things were trending there was a very real possibility of that happening. And that was incredibly unsettling. I went back to my room and called my friends who told me I get mean when I drink and told him I was choosing to be done with alcohol. 

It’s been hard. My friends have been doubting me, but are generally supportive. But it feels different, like something genuinely snapped into place.  I didn’t drink on the 4th despite being surrounded by people drinking. 

It’s been less than 2 weeks but it feels like an eternity. I can’t fall into the same hole my entire family has fallen into. I can do things differently. 

Thank you for giving me a place to be sober. It’s for real this time. IWNDWYT.

Edit: just wanted to say thank you for the outpouring of love. I didn’t consider myself a “real” alcoholic because I always knew someone worse.

In there were a couple who were clearly very very drunk judging by the sheer amount of empty glasses on their table. They were passionately kissing and touching each other in a manner more suited to a night club or an adult film set rather than a family friendly restaurant at 4pm. Bar staff were laughing at them and customers averting their eyes. Eventually they went to the unisex toilet in the restaurant together while not re-emerging for a solid 20 minutes.

It chilled me to the bone. This is how I acted in bars throughout 2017-19. I would meet a string of like.minded women, get mindlessly drunk with them and make a fool of myself as that couple did today. Sometimes the girls came back to mine sometimes they didnt. The only constant was the deep shame I felt the next day until the cycle started again.

I am so ashamed of my drunken behaviour and am so happy it never will haunt me again. I feel we all need the odd reminder of where we were and where we are now. So much healthier and better as people.

I had had a couple drinks, smoked a little weed...certainly nothing more than I had done in the past. But my entire body was gripped with horrible, involuntary shaking. My heart was racing. I truly felt like I was going to die. There was not a doubt in my mind.

I had always known booze was bad for me, and relied on weed as an anxiety reliever, sleep inducer, and all around alcohol replacement. But after that experience, I decided right away that I needed to ditch both.

It’s been a really hard few days but I’m hanging in. Doing my best to survive hour to hour. My partner has never been a big drinker, but he loves weed. He’s cut back in the last few days on my account, but just smoked right in front of me. I know it’s my problem, not his. I don’t want him to change his habits for me. But I feel so sad and alone right now. I don’t know how to handle all of this shit swirling around my brain without a crutch. Now it’s 6:30, and I’m in bed.

I've been sober on and off a few times over the past two years. An experience at a bachelorette party in August 2018 showed me that I have a serious binge drinking problem and I'm destroying my body and hollowing out my life, so I did a sober September and loved it. I've spent several holidays sober (4th of July last year, one Christmas, one Thanksgiving, even my birthday party at a karaoke bar) and I went on vacation to the Caribbean for a week with no booze. I even survived a work retreat completely sober. In the two years since I started flirting with the idea of being sober I've done a lot of work on myself and I'm so much happier and more confident than I used to be. I still have issues but I like myself and my life more than I ever have. 

My longest stint of sobriety was from January 1, 2020 through mid April. I gave in and ruined my streak on exactly day 100 (see post history). Before January I had reached the point where I needed Xanax to get through a hangover because it was so painful and anxiety-inducing. I was also diagnosed with gastritis in 2015 at the age of 23 and I lived with constant nausea for years before all my issues were magically cured by 3 months of sobriety.

Since April I have binge drank on 5 occasions including all day and night yesterday. I've had fun each time and woke up with only minor hangovers because my tolerance is so low I can get away with drinking a lot less now (and I have less anxiety than I used to) but each time I spend the next day in a fog that reminds me how lovely it feels to be clearheaded and engaged with the world. I'm the type of person who lives for ideas - if I could spend the rest of my life reading, thinking, listening to music, and writing about my ideas I would be incredibly happy and fulfilled. After a decade surfing the sine wave from drunk to hungover it was an incredible joy to spend nearly four months feeling alive and well-rested enough to read like I did when I was a kid. I felt the most like myself that I had since I was maybe 10 years old, before I started consciously hiding large parts of my personality in an effort to be popular and successful. I felt so fucking free. I had so much fun on every sober night out even if my friends were all drunk. I still smoked weed but I enjoyed it a thousand times more without the fog of alcohol. I felt creative again for the first time in years.

So why do I keep letting myself drink? I enjoy the looseness I feel after a couple glasses of wine, I enjoy the aesthetic and the ritual of opening a bottle of wine in the garden on a beautiful summer evening, and I really do enjoy the taste (sorry Annie Grace)...but it seems that the less I hate myself the less I actually enjoy being drunk. I've had more fun on nights out with just a RedBull than I have any time I've been drunk in the past year....yet I seem to only remember this when I wake up feeling lobotomized by a night of drinking. It's like I can't reconcile how good I feel sober with the image of myself as some kind of lame sober person who only drinks caffeine (vs the sophisticated but wild party girl that I've been for years). It's especially tough because I never hit a real rock bottom so my friends roll their eyes when I say I have a drinking problem. I feel inauthentic being sober because I don't have the kind of problem that gets you fired or sent to rehab or killed or something. I feel like admitting I don't want to drink anymore makes me lame and boring because I'm not an obvious train wreck. I feel like people will think I'm exaggerating or being a hypochondriac if I tell them drinking was seriously affecting my life because I was always functional from the outside.

How do I stop for good? I feel like I've been driving down a dirt road in the same set of tire tracks for 15 years and I desperately want to make a turn but every time I get three wheels out of the rut the fourth one pulls me back in. If that makes any sense.

Of course, in this subject, notably, every individual case is different/

But here is my testimony.

I have been drinking for the past 40 years. Continuously, more and more frequently, in gradually larger quantities, harder drinks, etc. Binging, all the time.

A more than a month ago, without any particular reason – perhaps, just by curiosity -, I decided, not to stop, but to interrupt my drinking. Zero alcohol, not a drop, for at least 5 weeks now.

You know what happened ?

Nothing.

Nada.

Before I started this - disappointing - experiment, I read dozens of articles, testimonials, etc., on the subject. There is a lot of copy/pasting going on, in that regard, btw…

As far as my experience goes, all that is pretty much BS

a) it was extremely, extremely EASY to stop drinking. I don’t have any merit, it was just not hard to do, at all. After 40 years of continuous, serious drinking.  Once I decided to stop, I have not felt ANY any urge to drink, for 5+ weeks now, not a single time.

b) I am not feeling any healthier

this is good, and bad…

Bad, because I wish I would have experienced the health benefits so many people are writing about on the Internet, when they stopped, but for me : zero effect.

Good, because it means that after 40 years of heavy drinking, it seems that there was not much health damage, to reverse.

I don’t know what else to say…

Again, every case is different, but for me, this was a non-experience.

I will continue to drink less, anyways.

Since I also realized that it does not “help”, with regard to any emotional situations. It does not make them worse, but it does not help, neither. So, what’s the point ? because drinking is also a lot of work.. so, why all that, for no interesting effect

And it is true that I am saving a lot of money…

So, cheers to not drinking, I guess… (well, let’s not go overboard now : cheers, to drinking less)

And a couple years before that also. The reason I quit drinking was because I was diagnosed bipolar 1. A legitimate bipolar diagnoses not the bullshit ones where they get all bitching and think that's being bipolar. I was drinking pretty heavily and once I started medication it really brought me down to some dark places to the point where I was afraid of my well being. I have quit before for about 200 some days. Then I thought (like many of us) I could handle it this time and only drink here and there. Well obviously that didn't work and I was drinking and driving every day again. 

&#x200B;

I distanced myself from my old friends because they were (are) big drinkers and I just had enough of that atmosphere. Plus I thought they were really stuck and complacent in there lives where I wanted more. So for whatever reason I decided to go to a small gathering of 3 brothers that I'm close with their father as well as all 3 of them. I was the first person at the accident where my friends mom where she died in the accident because of booze. I went to their fathers house woke him up at 2 am and told him that his son and wife were in a accident and that his wife was dead but his son was ok. Then I drove back and finished up with the police and brought my buddy home. After that I have been really close and respected by their father. And they mean the world to me, I'm tearin up just thinking about it. Reason being is that I don't care much for anyone so they truly are something special. 

&#x200B;

Anyways I was the only one not drinking there but they all were actually really great to be around. I feel terrible that I haven't seen them in so long. There was one of my oldest dearest friends there as well which we talked quite a bit too. After all this time I think I can handle being around people drinking at least these people. It wasn't a shit show from anyone. Everyone was super respectful and didn't give two shits about me not drinking. 

&#x200B;

This is a huge step forward to getting some much needed people back in my life. I am finally ready! And they are finally ready to accept my sobriety without a second thought. **Thanks SD for being here to share these thoughts where otherwise I have no one that would care about what I have said.**",26,0

Driving home from my parents' it took every ounce of self control I possess to not stop and buy a bottle of wine. 

I thought it through tho. Grabbed a snack from my mom so I wouldn't have any reason to stop at any store. Drove directly home. Came right up into the apartment, locked the door, took off my shoes and bra. Now I'm lying on my bed, in my pajamas.

Now, if I want to drink, I'll have to 1. Get up, 2. Get dressed, 3. Put on shoes, 4. Walk down to the car, 5. Start the car and pull out of the driveway, 6. Merge into traffic (oy), 7. Put on my mask, 8. Go into the store, where they'll certainly ask why I haven't been in for a week (awkward) 9. Get back into the car and merge back into traffic 10. Park the car and come back up the stairs 11. Take my outside clothes off AGAIN to put on my PJs...


And damn, that's a lot of work to drink. A lot of steps for something that's just going to be harmful in the long run. If I'm going to put in that many steps of effort, I'm going to try to think of something more beneficial to put the energy into.

My foggy head has made it difficult to appreciate being sober. While it’s better than a hangover, I just wish it would pass. I guess it’s the price I pay. 

On Friday I went out with my friends except I was the DD. It was really nice to get them all hold safely. I had a lot of fun too! It made me remember that I don’t need alcohol to have fun and that I think a lot of my friends were relieved I’m finally coming to my senses. 

I’ve been on the journey for a long time, and I have been blacking out less often than I used too - but I’m still blacking out. It’s not safe and it’s really fucking ugly. I know I am not capable of moderate drinking. I’ve had some honest conversations with my mom, and she’s being supportive even though she thinks sobriety is extreme. I don’t. I know I have a problem and I want to tackle it head on. Enough is enough. 

Anyways, thanks for listening to me rant. IWNDWYT.",47,0

I have 2.5 years alcohol free and feel strongly it’s the best decision I have ever made, especially on days after a large drinking holiday. I’m curious if anyone would like to commit with me to a social media free Sunday (for me that means primarily insta and facebook). Unfortunately I feel like the internet, food and vaping are what I have turned to as coping mechanisms over after I ditched the booze and I’m trying to slowly develop better habits around them. So with that, anyone else feel like abstaining from the endless scroll today? No Facebook twitter instagram pinterest etc etc

Im a little over 2 months sober and i still get that special little feeling in the morning, that sigh of relief, that i am refreshed and not hungover. I hope it never goes away. There is something extra special though, about waking up sober after a drinking holiday (all of them are, but the more notable ones). 

Last year on the 4th, i remember a little voice telling me, ""everyone is drinking tonight and everyone will be hungover tomorrow, so you dont have to feel guilty about being a lazy piece of shit the next day and not getting anything done."" 

This year, i was tempted to drink again, mostly because anger is my trigger and i happened to get mad about something yesterday, but my other side definitely knew it was the 4th of july and tried to use it as leverage. I had planned on taking a bike ride and touring the fireworks around my neighborhood but decided going on foot would be safer after stepping outside. It was fucking crazy. It sounded like WW1. Idk if it was because i was sober or that maybe more ppl were shooting off fireworks this year or what, but the vibe i was getting was very hostile and reckless. 

I took a relaxing epsom salt bath, smoked some indica wax from my weed pen, and put 2 ear plugs in (i normally put an earplug in whichever ear is not on my pillow. If you havent tried it, it takes a night or two to get used to but you will go to sleep so much faster) to combat the ongoing explosions outside my bedroom. 

I woke up around 7am this morning, ate an egg sandwich, drank some tea, read a book, then remembered something - ""everyone else is in bed either still drunk or hungover right now! Haha! I wonder what kind of mess everyone made last night."" So i went out for a bike ride and was not disappointed. Idk why it brought me so much satisfaction to ride around town on my bike with the thought that everyone i passed was too worn out to be doing what i was doing (prbly cause ive spent too many days hungover with the image of the rest of the world passing me by while i regressed) but it most definitely did. I stopped at one point to put out a firework that was still smoking in the street and as i poured some water on it, i heard someone open their car door and yak! Right on their own front lawn! most likely about to go to church or work hungover. Sucks for you buddy! I may sound haughty but for once in a long time, i feel ahead of the game. I feel capable. I feel like myself. I feel GOOD.

TL/DR: 4th of july celebrations are actually quite sloppy and destructive through sober lens. Not worth the giant mess around town. Feels good to be awake and alert while everyone else is struggling to function.",3,0

We're all in this together, helping one another as best we can. I posted this past Friday about potentially visiting IOP rehab and that is being arranged in the background. I have also started drug counseling, and it's nice to have a therapist again to offload my problems so I don't have to exhaust my friends with all my maladies. 

Anyways, in my 20s (40 now, and male) I drank pretty regularly. Probably \~5 times a week. Never had an inkling of withdrawals, even when I went cold turkey on my 30th birthday as I decided I was no spring chicken any more and needed to cut down. Around this time, I started compartmentalizing my drinking such that it became primarily a Friday or Saturday night kind of thing. Did I drink during the week sometimes? Certainly. But, mainly, it was drink a lot on friday. Stop. Feel great. Then do it all over again. I've definitely had an uptick in my drinking since this COVID thing, drinking during the work more than normal as I'm home and have a lot more  downtime. However; this past decade has been a never-ending stop|start|stop|start cycle. And I've started to realize how I've felt over the past year or so especially is textbook kindling. I have never experienced external shakes, like where my hands are trembling. I do, however, get panic attack like symptoms where I am cognizant of my heartbeat and feeling shaky internally. And, I get scared. And a little sweaty. I actually felt both hot AND cold at the same time, something I've never experienced before.I didn't feel like doing much so I kind of just worked on my house, and sat on my ass watching TV to distract my mind. If my mind was occupied, I didn't feel any symptoms so I think I can chalk most of it up to extreme anxiety, something I have suffered from my whole life. But, in terms of intensity - It's definitely become more pronounced over the past year or so. I am not a doctor or anything, it seems like myself - the decade long binger - has kindled himself into a bad predicament.  I actually thought I was doing the smarter harm reduction thing to cut drinking down a single day. Sigh. I guess this is why we should consult with doctors and professionals before making drastic changes on physically addictive substance. Anyways...  

I want to believe that fear of this getting worse will be the straw that broke the camel's back. I feel fantastic today, but the last couple days were tough on me. I was actually a little scared at times and wondered if I was in a danger zone.  I took some vitamins and drank a lot of water and it definitely passed so I think I'm okay. I slept for 12 hours last night after being being unable to sleep on Friday night.  But, this kindling is not joke.",5,1

I have had bad break ups in the past. I am happily married now but I have periodically thought back at how I dealt with heart break and always wish I has the wisdom to have acted differently. One thing I would have done differently would be to act with dignity.

When you miss someone you often only remember the good times. Maybe even meet up for some post break up sex with your ex.

I have made it over a year now, and I'm just really proud of myself and thankful to this community. This is definitely one of the main reasons why I was able to continue not drinking in the early days (making a habit of continually reading posts, commenting, posting) and although I didn't do meetings or anything like that, I see how the personal accountability (even if self-created) is really important.  

i didn't remember to post here at one year, which for me is a really good thing. it is so normal now that I just don't drink that it's not something I think about constantly. I know there are different approaches to quitting, but what worked for me has been trying to get back into my life in an active way, not dwelling on the past, imagining the good things that can be and working towards them.  Replacing old habits/places with new ones.  But also, just being present (not in the past, or future, but in the now).  

There's been so much about my life that has totally fallen apart recently (thanks covid) even as everything else is more clear, peaceful, happy and I know that is because of a better mindset and abstaining from alcohol. I absolutely could not imagine drinking again. It seems pointless, boring, gross, and uncomfortable. I just woke up early on a sunday, totally clear-headed, and am so excited to have the whole day ahead of me. I feel like this most days now! and on days I don't, I know that maybe it's just something else, and that's okay.  I actually understand that there are messages my body/mind sends about well-being that I wasn't able to hear before (the hangover was always too loud).

I hope you all are doing well out there, I imagine it's a hard time to be quitting with the quarantines and social distancing (but then again, maybe it's easier without the peer pressure of social dynamics?).... but, keep going! Or if you are reading this and thinking about quitting - do it. I've never felt better about a life decision than this one; it didn't make everything in my life better but life, itself, became more real.  I'm now more awake, present, and able to go deeper into all the experiences, plus I don't have a depressant waging war on my brain chemistry and my anxiety/depression have mostly vanished!

have a great day today, IWNDWYT! and thanks for being here. :)",24,3

I was just shocked at the incredibly intense and insatiable thirst I have had since that moment for an alcoholic drink, despite not having any intention to have one before that moment.

Made a big fuss with the letting company immediately and they're getting pest control in. Luckily we have some time before we absolutely have to move in but it was a stressful and disappointing day, and resulted in the biggest argument me and my partner have ever had.

We'd gone from exciting moving day to sitting in the old place surrounded by packed boxes and no space. At one point I stormed out. Old me would have gone to the bar, and I came close, but I managed to direct myself to the park instead.

Luckily we cooled off and made up. On Friday afternoon we decided to drive out to my dad's place in the countryside for a few days to camp and get some space.

Only downside to that is that my dad is a bit of an alcoholic and we usually get shitfaced together. He always has the best wine. I was feeling really nervous. I wanted to see him but knew he would immediately try to get me to have a drink.

Well, this is the second morning since we arrived here on Friday and I've woken up fresh and clear headed.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hello all! Very excited to be the next host! This is my first time, so go easy on me! (Especially for the unbelievably cliché start, yikes 😬)

Yesterday was Independence Day in America, and although we weren't allowed to gather for fireworks (at least not in my state), people still gathered for food, laughter, and of course, drinks. I work at a moving company and earlier this week my boss said ""Try your best not to book jobs on the 5th, cause I know everyone's going to be drinking on the 4th and at this point, it'll be easier to just give everyone the extra day off so we don't have everyone requesting it.""

I thought about this for a long time. I realized people do this sort of thing all the time without even being aware of it; they'll try to take the next day off after an event so they can *recover*. In planning their 'fun' day or night, they are also planning to feel horribly ill and (at least in my experience) planning to not be in the condition to do anything the next day.

I'm grateful that now I can look forward to fun events and holidays without having to suffer the obligatory hangover. I suppose not everyone feels terrible *every* time after a bout of heavy drinking, but who wants to play that game of Russian Roulette? 

What are you looking forward to enjoying without the painful side effects or the stressful guessing games?",101,0
2698,2020-07-05 00:19:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hlglq3/feeling_of_power/,Feeling of power,"Today, I had the benefits of not drinking reinforced, being the Fourth of July and all. At first I would think about it on days like today but I'm finally starting to not get any urges at all.

There were tons of people out drinking by the pool at my apartment complex today for their celebration. Had I been my prior self, I would have been out there drinking all day as well, likely having a good time at first, then regretting progressively dumb things I said and did as the fireworks drew closer. Instead, the reason I was walking by the area was to go for a workout at the gym. 

On the stairs in front of me, this lady in her 40s is sitting as a blockade. I see a man try to squeeze past her since she doesn't bother moving. My turn comes to pass her. We both smile and say hi, she was friendly. The first thing I notice is her cigarette, then her swaying, and how her eye contact isn't steady. I knew exactly what she was feeling, having to take a break from enjoying the day with her friends. It was only 4pm and she was already close to the point of falling out. 

On one hand, I sort of felt pity. I know she's going to regret how she spent her holiday, likely missing the fireworks, the rest of the evening, the lunar eclipse, regretting something she did/said, and feeling terrible. 

On the other hand, I felt in control of myself and I felt power. When I was drinking, of course I was more talkative but it's too easy to say something stupid or realize someone's halfway paying attention to your conversation because you're speaking nonsense. I already had my errands done for the day, I was working out, and I had the remaining 8 hours of the evening to enjoy. 

Tonight, I'll drink a soda and play a video game for an hour until the eclipse is here. Then I'll go Rollerblade or skateboard while watching the eclipse and the last of the fireworks. I can eat pretty much whatever I want now since working out and not drinking still puts me in a calorie deficit. I've thrown yoga in the mix and am starting to physically feel like a kid again, eating junk food, still staying in shape and being active without aching all the time.

I thought everything being closed during COVID would suck at first but it's kind of awesome. It really feels like the year is 2001 instead of 2020. I'm going outside more often while saving a ton of money due to not spending it on dining out and alcohol. While alcohol takes the day away from many tomorrow, I'll have 16 hours to learn things I'm working toward for furthering my career and do any other activities I'm in the mood for.

There are many aspects to mental health but not drinking has completely zapped a negative one out of the equation. I simply don't have to think about how to deal with it anymore. I do activities I actually enjoy, instead of doing an activity because it involves people and alcohol.

It feels much shorter some days, much longer on others. The temptation has been REAL this week though, so let’s go through it.

Fourth of July, the big one I’m sure most of you relate to today. I was so happy to sleep in today, for the first time in a month not having to wake up by 8 for work or a work out. In rare form, my husband was up before me. I jokingly implied he should go to the store and grab a couple of things so I could make a super indulgent Fourth of July snack - he pointed to his half empty wine glass and said he was already on his third (large) glass. Mine you I slept til about noon but, he was already almost a bottle in before I had been up for 30 minutes.

Now I get it. Normally this would be me; hell, I’d probably have been a lot deeper, and about ready for a drunk afternoon nap. I try not to judge him for still drinking, or other people for wanting to “enjoy” their holidays.

But it made me want to dive right into obliteration with him. I broke a 30 day streak last year on the 4th, using it as an excuse to get blacked out at a friend’s house and then spiral for the next couple months before trying again. I’ve been reminding myself how close I am to 200, and it’s been loosely holding me together today.

The other big temptation I’ve been seeing is that, due to some changes at work, I’m getting a week long vacation in August I wasn’t expecting. I’m excited, and quite frankly, I deserve it. We’re looking at doing an all inclusive, which in theory is great and easy, but of course includes booze and the war has already started in my head about whether or not to drink.

We did an all inclusive for our honeymoon, and honestly had a great time. I’ve thought a lot though about how much more I could have maximized it if I hadn’t drank so much, how many more mornings I could have spent on a catamaran or the dinners we missed because we were sleeping off our day drinking. Yet here I am, already trying to justify it (it’s included in the price! it’s just one week, then back to normal!)

Maybe I’m just at that point in sobriety where it’s harder to remember how ugly the bottom was. I’ve been focusing on what I remember of last year’s 4th: feeling woozy, friends trying to talk to me while I was getting drunk depressed and wanting to be alone, having to leave early before I passed out on a couch or said something damaging.

I’m okay for today. But I can’t stop romanticizing a vacation that I already have lived and wished I’d done a different way. I know better, but I’m still struggling with it. I wish I could marry logic to my emotions, but the rose colored glasses are on.

I realize I still have plenty of time to smash them though, so I’m here and ready to remember what that bottom looked like. To remind myself what it leads to, because it won’t just be one week of indulgence. To read and listen to all of your stories, and take the time to think about what that week could be if I just commit to enjoying it sober. And til then, it’s just one day at a time.",29,0

2716,2020-07-04 19:54:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/hld8u6/my_experience_as_a_former_teenage_alcoholic_long/,My experience as a former teenage alcoholic (Long post),"I started drinking when I was 17, started off with vodka and rum. I immediately fell in love with alcohol - especially vodka. Didn't have my first beer or wine until 2 years later. Those first 2 years were the peak, as I basically hit the ground running.

Little bit of background- I wasn't abused or raised in a bad home or anything, my parents have been great for the most part. However I've had major depression and GAD ever since I can remember, greatly exacerbated by puberty. By the time I was 17 I had completely given up on school and was just coasting by. I was super into weed (still am) and was looking for something stronger, more numbing.

I had tried plenty of other drugs before I got around to booze. Adderall, coke, molly, acid, you name it. None of them scratched the itch I needed. I took my first shot of Smirnoff and realized that's what I had been missing my whole life. This was the answer. Took at least 25 more shots that night, threw up everywhere and embarrassed myself thoroughly.

The next 2 years were spent doing some sort of twisted cosplay of a homeless alcoholic. Me, a white upper middle class guy from a good home, was getting wasted at 9'oclock in the morning, shoplifting, passing out in ditches, getting into fights, you name it. Basically channeling my inner Frank Gallagher. Might sound fun to some of you but keep in mind, I was miserable. My depression and addiction had taken hold of me to the point where really the only reason I kept on living was to get fucked up again.

I'll never forget the look of disappointment on my dad's face when he found me blacked out in the driver's seat of my car, two empty handles of tequila in my lap and the car still running, at 7 in the morning. The look of a man who knows he raised an alcoholic, and it's too late to do anything about it.

Lemme tell you. It might sound fun to not give a fuck about anything, wander around all day getting hammered and doing whatever you want. But it's not. There's nothing to glorify about being a drunk. It's fucking embarrassing showing up to a friend's house where everyone else is having fun sober, maybe sipping a beer, and you're the only one so trashed he can barely stand up. Trust me that shit ain't fun, it ain't a movie. It's real life and the pain doesn't stay gone after the alcohol leaves your system.

Anyway, couple terrible decisions later, followed by some good ones left me in the position I'm in now. Ended up in handcuffs, a hospital bed, the whole shebang. Almost got kicked out of college, I'm very lucky and grateful I didn't. Since then, I'm 2 and half years sober from liquor and hard drugs. I still smoke weed daily and occasionally drink beer- but I've learned moderation and I'm fine now. I'm very lucky that I learned my lesson before I ended up in a cell or in a grave.

There's a lot of things I wish someone would have told me back then. Here's one:

Alcoholics (myself included) love to say things like, ""Life is too short to spend it sober, I'm gonna be fucked up as much as I can"". I used to think just like this. But here's what you don't realize: just like anything, getting fucked up gets less and less fun the more you do it. If you start every day with a breakfast of adderall and percs and wash it down with vodka like a soldier in the Red Army every single fucking day, it stops being fun. It becomes mandatory. You do it just to feel normal. I didn't drink to have fun- I drank because the thought of facing reality without the comfort of booze made my skin crawl.

Another thing: just quitting drinking is merely a band-aid for the problem. The true problem is what drives you to be an alcoholic in the first place. What makes you want to get so fucked up you don't remember your name? Merely quitting drinking without doing some deep soul searching and thinking critically about your mental health, isn't going to do anything helpful in the long term.

Well, that's it. Hope someone finds this helpful.",12,0

As soon as I walked into the pub, I felt like I was smelling an old loved friend. All I wanted to do was embrace that friend, I’d missed them so much. I knew then the night would be hard. Every time I poured a drink I felt like shit. I was riddled with anxiety. Every time a customer offered to buy a drink, I quick fired “no” but felt so strongly like I wanted to say yes. At the end of the shift, while my coworkers still don’t really believe I’m not drinking, kept offering a quick beer before heading home. I nearly ran out of there. I hardly even said bye. I honestly just feel ridiculous.

I screwed up last year and became a closet alcoholic, publicly drinking beer but secretly downing handles of whiskey or vodka. I'd had heart surgery earlier in the year, which seems to have a strong causative effect towards clinical depression (i.e., not just ""feeling blue""). Alcohol helped numb that and take the edge off the boredom of recovery. On top of that, I was raised on a media diet of strong, silent ""real"" men who drowned their sorrows with a shot or, better, a bottle.

It came to a head when I tried stopping and went into moderate withdrawal, shakes so bad I could hardly stand. I asked to go to the ER and was treated for a few days. The revelation of my secret almost broke up my marriage. Nonetheless, after about three weeks of solemn sobriety, I started up again. And stopped, and started, and stopped, and started. Keeping it all secret, blaming unknown ailments for my mental incapacitation and drowsiness when drinking, or anxiety, shakes and nausea when I was withdrawing.

I'm mostly over the (thankfully mild) withdrawal symptoms this time. I have to make this stick. I like the sober me better. Wish me luck.",6,0

i don’t like who i am when i drink. plain and simple. 

my issue is, being a bartender has always been my job. i’m very good at it, i enjoy making drinks, and the money is awesome. the only issue is i’m consistently surrounded by alcohol. it’s really hard. 

to combat the urge to drink at work, i bought a car. it’s REALLY helped, but of course with the pandemic i’ve been at home for a few months and inevitably the urge to have a drink comes on. 

i guess my question is:  does anyone have experience being a sober bartender, and what were your tips and tricks to sticking with it? i want to be happy and healthy and not reliant on alcohol in order to socialize. i want to enjoy my job without the looming urge to drink haunting me. i want to be successful and i want to not have to rely on alcohol as a crutch, but as i said, it’s RIGHT THERE all the time.

This is just the start but I'm proud of myself for getting here. I'm working to address the reasons for my habitual self medication, rather than just white knuckling it like I have before. 

I've taken time off work to focus on myself. I am drinking tea and water and squash. I am eating moderately, but allowing myself ice cream and chocolate. I am exercising regularly, but not too intensely. I am learning about Buddhism and trying to practice self-love. I am reading about others' experiences with addiction. I am buying myself gifts. I am talking care of my skin, nails, hair and teeth. I am going to bed early and waking up naturally.

It feels different this time. It is still difficult - the first few days were the worst, coming off of a bender riddled with anxiety and hopelessness. But this has eased. Now there are patches of boredom, longing, jealousy of others who are out drinking. But there is also peace and freedom.

When I get a craving I question why I want the glass of wine, why do I desire it? What is beneath the desire for wine? A desire to cover up my anxiety and pain? A distraction so that I do not have to face myself? I keep going, deep enough until I find that I am enough, just as I am. I do not need that glass of wine to fill a hole, because I am... whole. 

It is early days. I have given myself a break from life so that I have a fighting chance to get better. To fix my body and mind. But I will have to go back to it all eventually. 

I want to feel healthy and vibrant and to live a new life free of these addictions, but I am scared I will not be strong enough. That I will fall back into old routines, that I will envy my friends who are drinking and feel disconnected. But I cannot predict or live in the future, I can only work for it now. And right now I do not want to drink again, I do not have to drink again and that is enough.

Honestly, it was probably 20 years ago when I had just graduated high school. One year ago today, I was riding a two month streak of sobriety from alcohol and decided I could have a “special” day, a one-off day, a cheat day, whatever you want to call it.

You can probably guess how that turned out. Today is day 30 for me now. This year is different. I am content in my sobriety; it feels normal now. The fuzzy feeling of being intoxicated feels far away, almost like a dream that slips through your fingers as one wakes.

The holiday brings back some of those old feelings though. Sun and cold brews and blowing shit up. It all should go hand in hand like coffee and a cigarette in the morning. Today is a big step for me in beginning to unlearn these associations. The sun rose today, the sun will set tonight, and there is no magic in the air trying to spirit away my sobriety.

The associations of a alcohol and holiday live inside my mind; I will not surpress them. I will embrace them and wrestle with them and grow myself above them. They will always exist, but they will eventually be a thing of the past, something distant in the rear view mirror, shrinking against an ever expanding horizon. 

Today is one day of 30. Tomorrow will be one day of 31. With each day of sobriety, that day becomes a smaller fraction of our total sobriety. 

Today is a a special day, and for me it will be a celebration of conscious disassociation.

For clarification it was more of a small gathering of work colleagues than a party (covid yo; the six of us are around each other on our lunch breaks sans masks so maybe not the greatest social distancing but hopefully not the worst?) but it was a big deal for me since I rarely socialize and I haven’t done anything social with other people since I sobered up. 

I brought a veggie tray with some diet caffeine free coke and just hung out and chatted and had a great time with my fellow vet techs outside of the clinic while we played party games and listened to music. I didn’t have to explain that I didn’t drink, everybody was cool with it and I felt accepted. 

A year ago I would’ve been sloshed before 10pm; last night I was super safe to drive home and today I remember what we talked about and I am comfortable with my behavior as opposed to being embarrassed.

Vodka finally caught up to me a year ago on the 4th and landed me in the ER for withdrawal symptoms (turns out I wasn't that bad of a case, but its still scary as shit).  Before that I was lucky to have gone just a day without alcohol.  I didn't sleep in my own room for two weeks after that day because that's where I normally drank.

I drank for what feels like to me to be somewhat odd reasons.  I wasn't the type to drink emotions away, in fact I drank to feel them more and to get rid of the anxiety I always live with (I'm autistic, anxiety is a constant problem for me).  I'm glad I'm away from it though.  Things are undeniably better now.  I can think clearly, operate normally in a social environment, and personal relationships have never been better.  It really is worth it to keep staying away from alcohol.  I struggle with addictions in general, so to say that giving this one up is a big thing for me.

That's not to say there aren't things I miss.  Alcohol made video games way more enjoyable.  For some reason if I got the timing right, my skill with games improved for a time (not saying that through perception, I actually went all Mythbusters and tested this thoroughly).  I'm an avid player of Elite: Dangerous, a space simulator game where you can fly a spaceship literally anywhere in a 1-1 recreation of our galaxy.  Alcohol turned that game into a dream come true for my inner space-obsessed 5-year-old mind.  It brought out the wonder of spaceflight I'd forgotten I missed, but now I realize that in spite of all the fun it brought me, its still nowhere near worth it.

Looking back now I feel a bit like Frodo after he and Sam destroy the One Ring.  The burden of the Ring is finally gone, but he has to live with the mental effects for the rest of his life.  There's a good part of me that's glad I went through this experience, so I can better appreciate how insanely difficult it is to put the bottle down for good.  The mentality that got me through this past year was like the end of the movie The Martian. ""Solve one problem, then another, and another.  If you solve enough problems, you get to come home.""  So I take it one day at a time

I’m not a Deadhead, though I do enjoy their music, but when I heard about the Wharf Rats I was honestly, emotional. In the early 1980s a small group of Deadheads had gotten clean/sober and were no longer partaking in the drug culture that surrounded the band in the 60s and 70s, but were obviously still big fans of the music. So they started a chapter of AA, named it the Wharf Rats after a GD song, and would go to shows with big signs and balloons encouraging people who needed some support to get together in the crowd and enjoy the show together, sober. As a person who has been obsessed with music and been playing for around 18 years, I thought this was absolutely beautiful. I haven’t been to a big show sober yet, but I’m really looking forward to it. Especially after being inspired by the Wharf Rat community.

I SWAM AND SWAM, but I made no progress. 
I would go back and forth between giving up and just eating whatever,  wasting time with whoever was around,  who cares, to hating everything and trying to tear it all apart and figure out what was going on.
LUCKILY my little sister said we should do 21 days sober.   I finished my beer and committed to the random task.  I think it drove me to find you guys here.  I didn't expect to have withdrawal symptoms.   I was in denial about how much I drank.  And I didn't really know anything about alcohol.   
I remember just wanting to know how people even started.  I was searching every single symptom to see if others had it too.  It was really hard at the beginning - sleep was shit. headaches, agitation!!!!!!!   
I learned SO MUCH from you guys.  I got scared and inspired and uplifted and I am so thankful. 

My gains:
Weight loss, smarter (better memory and better thinking ability big time), more confident (like, i am fearless!), bigger boobs (no, jk) - I can focus and crack hilarious jokes and care and balance a busy schedule... and be prepared... and look forward to Monday.  And look forward to everything. 
I feel proud of the way I keep promises with myself.   I have never followed through so consistently... I know what I want to do and I do it.  And it fuels me to power through my days.  I am starting to actually get into hobbies... My energy levels are so stable.  

I have to say one major key for me has really been diet.  Like, after about 6 months I cut back a little on sugar (cuz I NEEDED it in the beginning) and then I just slowly started increasing my fiber and eating lots of fruit and then vegetables.   It definitely has helped.

I made a similar post in a couple other sub but I'll try to keep it short. I think I'm a terminal alcoholic. 

I started drinking when I was 15, I started with a coffee mug full of whiskey because I had no idea what I was doing. I was smoking weed for anxiety but I found something even better, and quickly started drinking every day

With anxiety and depression and shit I found it impossible to live life normally so I just drank constantly. I dropped out of grade 12, and finished it the next year, but I was drinking constantly through school. By 19 I was drinking 24/7. Then I was still drinking through college and work and I don't even want to think about the shit I did, throwing up in the work sinks, what people thought of me, but I did alright. When I say 24/7, I mean I would get up in the middle of the night and drink myself back to sleep, only to start again as soon as I woke up. 

Eventually I started making wine and distilling spirits with my mom, and drank up to a 26 of 80% alcohol a day, I dont even want to talk about the shit I did drinking I finally talked to a doctor about it and he sent me for an ultrasound. 

I had been diagnosed with kidney problems and kidney stones, a fatty gallbladder with potential gallstones, and an advanced fatty liver that was 33 inches long (average is 15) in 2018 due to alcohol abuse and suicide attempts. My cutting down was about 2 litres of wine a day. I still have not been able to quit drinking since then until a recent diagnosis of cirrhosis and a trip to the psychiatrist. My psych increased my Klonopin from 1 to 3mg a day plus other medications. This was ostensibly done so I could decrease my drinking as fast as possible and hopefully live a normal life, so I'm down to 5-6 drinks a day

I guess I left some stuff out but my doc basically says the damage is done, don't have long to live but I'm seeing a liver specialist in August. 

I don't know what the moral of the story is other than be careful with alcohol. I know most of you aren't as dumb as me but this sub helped me through some bad times. 

Most days, I'm so depressed I don't even care and would rather just drink myself to death or attempt suicide again. My doctor explained how I'm eventually going to bleed out internally one way or the other. 

Thanks you guys. I love you all, and I hope you find peace in your struggles. I will try not to drink with you today. <3

I was just shy of 2 weeks sober during my 4th last year, and we had already committed to hosting when I had decided to quit drinking. It was pretty rough for me to watch everyone drink. Gatherings still are a little hard for me. I'm pretty relieved that there's no pressure to host or go anywhere this year. This morning I was able to do all my food prep after my first cup of coffee, and do a light clean around the house (enough to help me feel relaxed in my space),  and now I have the rest of the day to just chill until we start eating and watching fireworks! Our neighborhood usually goes hard with fireworks, and with all the shows cancelled I have a feeling they're going to go even harder, so I'm looking forward to that. 

I feel like making a gratitude list today:

I'm grateful for all 378 days of sobriety. 

I'm grateful for a full night of sleep, and walking up fresh.

I'm grateful for the ability to truly be in the moment while playing with my pup.

I'm grateful for my love for cooking, and the grounding energy it give me.

I'm grateful for my partner who continuously supports me in all areas of life, and lovingly reminds me of why I don't drink anymore when I need to hear someone tell me.

I'm grateful for my 4 year relationship with my psychologist, who see's me on a special fee agreement since my health insurance has always been unsteady. I'm very comfortable talking to her, and appreciate her perspective . I'm grateful I have an appointment with her next week because I'm feeling like I'm in the midst of a depressed episode, and I'm struggling to bring myself out of it despite my efforts.

I'm grateful that I finally got caught with my work load yesterday, and I can take it a little easy this next week so I can redirect some of my energy to some self care and some mental health work.

What I haven't read about (probably for not reading everyone's posts) is the hardest part for me, which I will call resistance fatigue. 

Even though the urge and desire to go back to drinking ebbs and flows in general it does get much easier overtime. The hardest time frame for me came at the 1 to 4 month range. I personally found the first month to not be that hard as I was so angry at myself for who I was it overrode the desire. After I started feeling good about myself is when I had the hardest time. That period was when SD helped me the most. I will never be able to thank all of you enough for giving me the strength and courage to keep fighting.

Recently, covid-19 has been really fatiguing me. I feel like the stress of the pandemic and having a job that exposes me every work day to about 20 different people, having in-laws that want to see their grand kids and continuously pressuring us to chill about the virus and not being able to do my normal physical activities that help to reduce my stress has been piling up. I am very confident that I won't give in to the demon at the door (stealing from someone today in the daily pledge), but I am not feeling as strong as I normally do.

I’m on my countless day 5, but this time I’ve been doing it with AA. Ive managed to get weeks/months under my belt in the past, and didn’t feel a strong urge to drink after the first few weeks, I just always thought I could handle it. Then go on benders, spiral down, detox, rise and repeat ad infinitum. You guys know the routine. 

But every time I’ve given up alcohol, I replaced it with marijuana. I’ve been a marijuana smoker since I was 16 (26 now) except for a brief period when I wanted to be able to pass a drug test. Before that time I never really drank. But when I gave up the weed, I replaced it with booze. I didn’t realize the danger of that decision. I thought I could just switch one out for the other. Thats not the case and it’s the worst decision I’ve ever made. 

I’ve always had problems sleeping. Marijuana helps a lot in that respect. Marijuana never destroyed my life like alcohol has, but I can’t say that it hasn’t stagnated it. I truly do want to live a sober life. I want a better life. So this is where I’m conflicted. 

I know I’m an addict because the thought of going through the day without either scares me. 

I know that AA requires complete honesty and sobriety from all mind altering substances. 

I know that I want to stop drinking. I don’t know if I want to stop smoking (right now?). I know that I want the sober life I hear all these old timers in meetings talk about. 

I’m just really torn. The thought of giving up both at once really scares me. But the thought of going to AA and still using marijuana makes me a liar; an imposter. And that feels just as bad. 

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. Any input at all would be greatly appreciated. I’m at a crossroads and I’m not sure which way to go.",8,0

I'm not an alcohol addicted. I have none of the classic syntomps, I don't think about drinking all day and mostly drink only at night. Even my therapist that I frequented years ago told my personality doesn't fall in the category.
Nonetheless I drink every night since, i don't know, 12 years perphaps. And the problem I have with alcohol is that every time I grab the bottle I don't leave it until is empty. It makes me feel good, it makes me feel better with myself and more connected with my own feelings. Even people told me I'm way cool drunk than when I'm sober. Be a good day or a bad day, everything looks brighter with a glass in my hands.

I'm almost 30 and lately I've thought a lot about my life where I'm heading to and what I did the last decade and damn everything is so shit, I'm a mess. I isolated myself, I'm a lonely type and I enjoyed (and could drink freely), but now that loneliness is hitting me hard. I work in a toxic environment and I'm not doing well cause my mind is a bit numb cause all the drink I had the night before. I've also realized I'm an ugly person, not a bad one, the kind of person that have nothing to give you, won't cause you trouble but doesn't give you reason to stick with. 

I want to change and first thing I should do is stop drinking. Since the last week the liver area began to hurt and altought I think is just colitis, well it's scaring me.

I think I'm a substantially better person now that I'm sober. I'm more focused, more creative, more empathetic, and all around a more calm person. 

But I miss the social aspect of drinking. Quarantine has been really helpful in this regard because there's no parties/dinners to go to where I would have to be around alcohol. But my friends will talk about future post-COVID reunions at bars (or even overseas trips) and I guess I feel kind of sad that I won't get to partake in that - like I'd be missing some kind of social camaraderie? But I also don't want to drink. It's really easy for me to think ""Oh maybe I can just have one"" but moderation hasn't worked that well for me in the past. I also can't stress enough that I *really* don't want to drink (for the first time in almost a year, I actually like who I am, and sobriety has been essential for that). I guess I'm just confused about why I'm feeling this way and how to maybe reframe it or approach it differently so I don't feel like I will be missing out when reunions and post-COVID plans inevitably happen.

Quitting alcohol allowed me be healthier, physically look better (no dark circles under my eyes), have more energy and strength to exercise, better mood and character to get things done, to be more friendly and allowed me to save money and buy more food or things I liked. It allowed me to think more clearly and set goals.

This morning my partner and I woke up early and went for a hike with our dogs. And we got back home before 10am, which is when I’d normally wake up hungover and hating my life the day after my birthday party. But this year I’m eating avocado toast and drinking coffee. Next I’ll take a leisurely shower and then tidy up from the calm, fun party. 

If you are on the fence like I was for many years, take the plunge. It really is great on this side of the fence. I’ll never be a morning person, but waking up groggy at 7:30 to go on a hike beats waking up at 10 hung over AF.

It was always easy to go to the back door of the bar my dad or his friends were working at and sneak away with some beers or liquor. I would stop in at the bar my dad worked at almost every night during the summer between college and close it down virtually every night. 

I got into my fair share of stupid drunk situations throughout high school and college. If I ever got too drunk and did something embarrassing or hurtful, I’d tell myself I would never get drunk like that again. Sure enough, it would eventually happen, just in a different way. 

More recently (at the age of 30) I am more conscious about my drinking, but what I’ve noticed is that the amount of alcohol I’m consuming is beyond acceptable. A couple weeks ago, I bought a liter of vodka because I had a stressful day and ended up drinking most of it. I finished it the next afternoon to get rid of the edge.

After the intake analysis they determined I needed a 30 day program and my insurance agreed to cover it. I remember very little of the first 3 days, they do a medical detox that involves A LOT of medication. After the cycle of tapers I was more clear and got a lot out of the group therapy and meetings. Around day 14 I started to get depressed and agitated. The straw that broke the camels back and made me realize I had to leave was not drinking related. There were people there for a lot of different things. Including a lot of people who were IV heroin users. While I've never persobally done it, my ex did. He shot up in front of me for 2 years and hearing people glorify there drug use brought back a lot of memories that I had worked hard to get past. After talking to some of the techs there I realized that being there was doing more harm to me mentally then good. So I left. I left because I felt confident that I wasn't leaving to drink. And I haven't. Today is day 19 and I am loving every second of being sober. I know the cravings will come but I feel equipped against them now.

I have a month left living in a flat with my ex boyfriend. I have a property lined up but I can't go anywhere until then, I need to stay in this property to go to work nearby. My family and friends live 200 miles away and I have no feasible way to get to them.

I am a recovering alcoholic, I started to drink while living in a flat with my last ex boyfriend, who raped me several times. Some of the rapes were clear cut - I asked him to stop when I was in physical pain, and he continued until he was finished using statements such as ""I'm nearly there."" 

Other times, he would continue during the BDSM fetish ""consentual non consent"" (rape fetish play) that I had consented to under the specification that he stop if I used a safe word. He sometimes did not stop. We broke up when he slapped me on my birthday and he subsequently stopped paying rent and nearly had my family taken to court for it. He didn't clean the entire year we lived together and left the place absolutely rotten. I was completely destroyed. I have post traumatic stress disorder which causes crippling nightmares and subsequently insomnia. I started drinking as a means to achieve dreamless sleep.

This was years ago. I recovered, got a pretty good hold on my sobriety and moved in with a nicer, cleaner man. Only now I'm not clean enough (he has OCD) and he says things in arguments that completely destroy me. In the past, he's said that I suck the joy out of living, that I'm not capable of happiness, that I'm a fucking cunt. He defends himself having said those things, because at the time, those were truths to him. He's said he doesn't regret it.

Last night, he told me that he thinks I'm lying about my ex boyfriend raping me. He skirted around it a little, but phrases like ""the puzzle pieces just don't add up"" and ""you yourself have said you don't even know if it counts."" He called me a professional victim, and said that I will inevitably make myself out to be a victim when I talk about this to anyone else later. I haven't spoken about it to anyone but this subreddit. I'm so embarrassed. Afterwards he apologised sincerely and tried to initiate sex with me. I can't believe I've let his behaviour go so unchallenged for the past year that he thinks it's within the realms of possibility that he can say, literally, the most hurtful things possible to me, and still end up getting some. We only have one bed and no couch, so I slept on the floor. 

I'm so sad. I didn't think it was possible to be this sad. And I can't call anyone to talk about it, because he'll hear me talking and make my life so much harder. I've tried domestic abuse shelters and they're not picking up. I can't leave the city, my job is my passion and is providing me with a free university degree, and I can't risk living without it.

It's only 28 days, I know that. All I want to do is drink. I don't want to die, so I guess that's progress. But I don't feel like I can, do, sobriety. It's this small, horrible, one bedroom flat with this guy who makes me feel so incredibly small. And now he's apologised, so he thinks everything is fine. It's not fine. I'm not fine.

Nothing memorable, always at home because I was drinking, staring into a screen while drunk, as if that was real ""living.""

Fast forward a year. Anticipating a great stretch of weather over the holiday weekend, I rented a slip at a local marina for our tiny little motorboat so we could get some high quality family time on the lake without the hassle of trailering the boat back and forth to the lake. I bought Lobsters for the price of what would have been a couple nights of drinking last year. We thoroughly enjoyed them and headed to the lake where we went tubing for 3 hours. We watched an amazing sunset and then floated in front of an island on Lake Champlain and watched a $50,000 display of fireworks that wasn't advertised to the public that I was told about by a friend. As we floated there on the lake waiting for the fireworks, nearly a full moon glistening on the lake in front of us, a feeling of peace came over me. I was living. I was helping make memories for our kids. I was being a good partner to my wife. Life was finally good. This was my real life, not some dream. Not a movie. This was actually happening.

The fireworks were spectacular. Off in the distance I could hear some absolutely hammered people on their boat, singing along to Born in the USA. To each their own. I'm not in a position to pass judgement. I can assure you I feel better today than they do. Not just physically, but mentally and spiritually.

I'm telling myself now I'll drink only one or 2 and it ends beeing wasted 7/8 drinks later. I really have to accept moderation is not my cup of tea i guess.

Any tips you guys can give me to handle cravings?

My go to reason for not drinking is ""I'm on medication"" which technically isn't a lie. I take fluoxetine (anti depressant) and it says not to drink.

Tonight I was laid up on the couch generally being mad at the world because everyone is out there having a great time and I’m not. Lots of fireworks outside. Normally I’d be having some drinks with my partner and we’d probably be outside joining the neighborhood. But he knows I’m serious about quitting and I’m trying to change my ways so he isn’t bringing any booze around for both of us (he still has a normal persons amount very rarely though which is fine to me). 

Anyway so I’m literally laid up, not feeling good. My stomach is still messed up from a mess up on Tuesday where I caved and drank all day and didn’t eat much. Im not even physically recovered from that and my stupid brain was already trying to trick me in to drinking again because “why not, it’s not like you’ve even made it that many days”. Freaking astounding, I know. The tricks my mind likes to play blow me away, honestly. 

I messed up for numerous reasons but primarily because I stopped taking my Naltrexone, I already hopped back on don’t worry. 

So I get a couple hours in to “doom scroll and chill” where I’m hopping from media platform to media platform... all the while still fully irritated about my situation. Then, I came across a video of a woman I admire roller skating. I bought skates a year or more ago and I never got the hang of them. When I went to the rink for the first time, I barely made it to the floor and by that time I had been pointed out by a table full of women who were now all turned around waiting for me to get on the floor and bust my ass because I was SO wobbly. My anxiety kicked in and instead of getting out to learn, I just let my partner skate by himself even though it was my idea... and I just drank instead. 

So, tonight instead of drinking I laced up my skates, watched some YouTube videos and actually did the dang thing! By the end of my hour or two of messing around not only do I feel great that I learned something new, but I’m in a fantastic mood too. My head is clearer, thought processes for things I have been working on are running faster, and I’m excited that I didn’t cave! Unfortunately this excitement has kept me up a bit late but... f it. 

Today I distracted myself instead of drinking and I think that’s pretty swell. Tomorrow for the holiday i have an awesome snack spread planned instead. 

Do you have any favorite distraction techniques? I’m going to need some more of these I bet.",17,0

What got me most about today was that I had almost forgotten that it was my soberversary, which I never thought was possible. The combination of the holiday and what it meant to me made me think I would be an emotional mess every year. I definitely was the first year! It was easier the second and the third, and then this year I was just thinking about all of the cool projects I've got going on. 

SD really helped me, especially the first year and all of the ups and downs that entailed. It wasn't easy, but I've found amazing people and so many passions in sobriety. Here are a few tips and accomplishments that helped me get here and stay here, along with some progress pics:

Tips:

If you don't know how to start, talk to your doctor. Detoxing can be deadly, and believe me--unless you're actually dead, a healthcare worker has seen far worse than you are now. They (probably) won't judge, and if they do, they're pieces of shit who shouldn't be in the field; it's nothing to do with you. Most genuinely want to help you get better.

On top of that, don't wait because you don't think you're ""alcoholic enough"" to get help. By the time you're the bum under the bridge drinking from a paper bag (what I thought I had to be to get help), you're so far gone that it's going to be nearly impossible to come back. You can get help at any time, and asking for it shows strength, not weakness.

I'm a happy heathen and don't subscribe to AA religious models (but if AA works for you, awesome!). There are still great places to help you, so don't let that excuse hold you back. My IOP (intensive outpatient rehab), stopdrinking, and SMART recovery, are the methods I used.  

Accomplishments:

I thought that I would be bored if I quit drinking; that all of my friends would disappear and my life would end. I was half right! The only friends I had were toxic and shitty alcoholics that were keeping me down. They did disappear. My life as I knew it did end. 

But that's when I started to realize how empty my life had been. I had never seen a future for myself and was passively trying to commit suicide, even though I didn't realize it for a long time.

When I lost all of my shitty friends, I started looking into clubs for things that I used to love doing before I started using alcohol to solve all of my problems: hiking, adventure, travel, swimming, art, writing, dancing, tinkering...the list went on. I got into karate and axe-throwing and a makerspace collective. I showed a painting in a gallery and won awards for writing. Got promoted at work, twice, and bought a condo. Now I'm working on my first novel and looking into starting an art collective with some of the best people I've ever met.

Progress pics:

I've intentionally buried these down here and didn't put it in the subject because shitty Buzzfeed-type ""journalists"" have skimmed progress pics off of this site before without asking permission.  I've wrestled with whether or not to post these photos for a long time, and have finally decided to do it today because it might be what someone needs to see to know that they can do this too. And if you've read down this far, you might be doing a deep dive into the site looking for any hope or good news you can find, just like I did for a few months before I actually got help.

Note: NO ONE HAS PERMISSION TO REPUBLISH THESE PHOTOS.

The first photo is of me at my absolute lowest, in 2015. I was really drunk in this photo--I mean, it's Thanksgiving! You can't not be hammered! But when I saw this photo of me, I thought that the camera was broken and the lens distorted my pic. But, nope! I'd really was just that fat! This photo made me realize that I needed to start getting healthier or I wouldn't be around much longer.

[https://imgur.com/JgS6stV](https://imgur.com/JgS6stV)

I took this second photo a month or so ago, before I did a Zoom art friends meetup and realized I hadn't worn anything but pajamas in months and really wanted to look non-schlubby for a change. The lens ended up being foggy--I'm not quite that pale! But I still like the photo.

I want to be able to be open with my sobriety but the topic is constantly being danced around in my family. Specifically by my mother.

My mother has been trying to keep it a secret from other family members and it has been driving a major wedge in how I feel about her. My whole family drinks. Most of which I would say are addicts in denial.

Why should I have to stay quiet? 

I understand why my mom wants to keep it quiet, but  who cares?! Saying I got sober somehow has a stigma against it? I am exhausted with mmt family because they have to keep this ""everything is fine"" mentally. 

Why can I not say: hey I didn't want to die from alcohol so I got sober? Also you should do the same.

Why do I at a younger age have to be ashamed of the most adult decision I have ever made? 

This disagreement has made me drift from my family, making me realize realistically how toxic of an environment it is. I want to visit home less because of the realization I have had. 

My family would rather pretend to be ok while dying slowly inside, rather than be accused of being different.
My sobriety has made me think of this a lot.

Be proud of your decision. Find what makes you happy because it's definitely not alcohol. 
If anyone wants to chat, about anything. I'll be open.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Gosh I cant wait for the thoughts to diminish.

I was 1.5 years in before I convinced myself that I was fine to have that drink I would have laughed at as an alcoholic (it was an alcoholic spritzer. I was a whiskey/beer gal).

I’m fine, I maxed out a credit card but I’m fine.

It was a 5 month period where I would sporadically drink until a week ago when I started ‘needing’ to drink my coworker’s pbr the last hour of my 7 hour work day because I ran out of the spritzers I brought in. Then I would drink a few more after work.

I dont remember what day I stopped again but it’s been within this week.

After 6 months of not having insurance, I get to see my therapist in 2 weeks and I’m ready to do hard fucking work.

Doods, I’m going to be so fucking good. I know what I’m feeling right now could be that ‘I feel great!’ first few weeks after stopping and then it gets Hard.

Today is the type of day where I would go to the bar and 1 cocktail would turn into 3 or 4 then before I knew it I would be on another binge. I fought back the feelings and chose to go to my gym to clear my mind. This is a battle and I’m learning that I have to fight it daily even hourly. The fight is worth it though because I know I will be better for the victory. I’m also learning that there are underlying causes that give into and that’s when I binge.

My husband is done with finding me drunk in the middle of the day or passed out when he gets home from work. Covid was really bad for me. With working from home it’s been so easy to day drink or be hungover with no one to see. It took me to the very worst of my drinking yet. So I had my last drink at 10pm last night (Over 20 total). This morning I woke up with a hangover from hell. I usually would have had a drink to perk me up. By 10 am the shakes, anxiety and sweats started. Then came the vomiting and dry heaving. That’s a new one for me. I withdrawled all day with nothing and have just now taken a 5mg Valium (my doctor prescribed 20 to get me through the weekend detox). I’m terrified about sleep tonight, scared that I won’t be able to do this but know I HAVE to for myself, my daughter and my relationship and career.

Drinking to excess, and blacking out. Being dazed and confused upon waking up. Not getting out of bed until 2p. Obsessively checking calls/texts. Realizing I did call or text or email someone something bizarre. The shame, the guilt, the remorse. Extreme self hatred. 

I’m so depressed. I know drinking is making it way worse. I’m already on antidepressants. And I also know drinking is nullifying that. And yet, again, here I am still doing it. The repercussions are getting worse and worse, mental health wise. 

I’m so isolated and lonely. I feel like drinking is the only time I can or do connect with people. Living alone and being largely unemployed right now is fucking me up. I had a drinking problem before Corona but now it’s just getting worse. I’ve had nothing else I “needed” or “had” to do. So why not just piss my life away being pissed. Right? 

No! I have so much more to give. So much more to do. I have people and places and things I want to see. But I’m just self isolating even more. I feel horrible about that too. 

One second I want to stop, and I usually do for a few days, but in the next second I just don’t care anymore, so I drink.

They keep reaching out and I keep drawing back, unless I’m drunk that is. Then I just harass them incessantly. They know I’m struggling, and so I feel like a failure there too. 

Sigh. I feel like a lost cause. My insurance sent an email saying they had some online resources (programs) for addiction. I might look into that.

Maybe 11 or 12 years idfk.  Since I was a teenager.  I have smoked weed daily and compulsively for even longer.  I'm 29.  A year ago or so I took a 7 month break from drinking.  Still smoked, but did not have a drop of alcohol for 7 months.  It was a tad rough at first but I got used to it.  Then I slowly became more and more resentful of the fact that it was ""off limits"".  I watched my friends get drunk and have fun, becoming dribbling overly empathetic morons for an evening, and I missed that.  I ended up giving myself credit for the fact that what I was really craving was alcohol, and not cocaine.  There are worse, less socially acceptable vices, I thought.  So I eventually hopped off the wagon with a terrific sense of justification and enthusiasm.  My wife supported it, she supports me always.  She's an awesome person, who barely drinks at all btw.  My drinking is now worse than ever.  I am in tears writing this.  I wish more than anything that I could go back to never having relapsed, which I now realize is what happened.  Too little too late.

I had just short of 10 years in 2008 when I decided to pick up.  Have gotten steadily (though up and down, so maybe it's ok, right?) worse over time.  My last drink was Tuesday, and I'd been on a binge for five days.  My husband, for the first time, clearly expressed how pissed off he is by my drinking during the binge.  Before he just seemed hurt.

Anyway, I tried to reach my doctor and get detox meds (for the fourth time this year, hmm) but couldn't reach him.  So Wednesday was bad, yesterday a little less so, and today I feel kind of normal.  I know I felt better 10 days ago, but not bad.

My husband had to go to the store and pick something up via curbside service.  He asked me to go along, saying, ""It'll be fun, kind of.""  I know he's worried that I'll go buy alcohol.  My first impulse is to be mad at him, next to be grateful he cares about helping me get through the nasty withdrawal stage, next to go out and buy something or go dig through the house to see where he hid the few bottles of high-quality booze that he's resorted to hiding to be able to enjoy it in small amounts at at time.

I decided to go on this forum instead of taking another action.  I really do want to be long-term sober again, so I'm choosing something positive.  I am going to have to talk to him about it, which I'm not totally looking forward to, but I think it will improve my mindset.  IWNDWYT!",7,0

Today is the first time in well over a decade I didn’t have a beer (or ten) after mowing the lawn. It was hot as hell too-  the type of day and chore that made beer taste better than any other time. 

I had a slight tinge of something that I could only describe as regret. I then told myself that if I had been able to stop at 1 or 2 all along, I wouldn’t be in the situation I’m in. The feeling passed, and I had a giant glass of lemonade instead. Not the same, but hit the spot nonetheless. 

I’m thinking about picking up a six pack of one of the craft NA beers available around here, both to have one after lawn mowing, and to bring to any upcoming events where alcohol is readily available. I’ve got a few coming up in the next 3-4 weeks.  Still not sure about this yet.

A stroke is my greatest fear. I laugh at the prospect of being buried alive or burned at the stake, but a stroke strikes the fear of God in me.

No one expects a stroke. You can be walking the dog, washing dishes, or reading reddit when it happens. The numbness, slurred speech, the panic, the emergency room. Even worse is having a stroke in your sleep and waking up half-paralyzed.

If you know Breaking Bad, you must be familiar with the character of Hector Salamanca, whose faculties are limited to one finger. I always got nauseous and had a nightmare filled sleep after watching episodes with this tragic figure. For me, he is the summit of suffering.

A stroke will take a part of you. A skill you acquired, a language, years of education, the ability to move. It can change who you are. Make you grumpy and evil. Make you a burden to the people that you love. In the worst case a stroke can take you the physical capability to commit suicide, the last bastion of human dignity. 

I have seen the list of things to do to prevent a stroke a million times. I reluctantly switched smoking to IQOS and after a few months of being a laughing stock for shoving a ridiculous electric dildo in my face on every social occasion, I quit that as well. I do not own any salt. I cook my own foods. I forcefeed myself the most tasteless vegetables. I make garlic orgies. I abandoned my beloved fooling on the internet until the wee hours, so that I get enough sleep. I practiced hungover jogging, hungover jiu jitsu, hungover calisthenics, and hungover soccer almost everyday. I was a legend of stroke prevention, surely to be high-fived by any cardiologist. 

But there was always the drinking. The single immovable item on the list. The item around which I would have to maneuver somehow. Drinking had to stay. That is, until recently.

The only thing worse than X is X caused by one's own stupidity. Sitting in a wheelchair, knowing full well that it was my own fault would be a punishment impossible to bear.

Conversely, being paralyzed can be bearable if you know that you did everything you could to prevent it. I know that there are people who can bear such an affliction with dignity and live a fulfilling life. The chance that I am one of them went up a notch a little bit since I stopped drinking. It feels awesome.

I've had good stretches of sobriety, some even lasting weeks. But my life kinda fell to shambles (not because of alcohol) a little over three years ago, and things only got worse from there (some of it because of alcohol.) But I just can't seem to remain sober for much longer than a week or two at this point.

Hopefully this will give me the tools and whatnot I need to find another way to cope, rather than to crawl into a bottle.

I've wanted to cut back on my drinking, potentially quit entirely, for quite some time now but have been dragging my heels about it. I think mostly it's just fear about what I'll do or say when I'm offered a (or expected to) drink. 

I woke up Wednesday morning and decided that I'm going to have a dry July, take note of how I feel throughout the month, and then hopefully continue it; for some reason having a timeline made the decision easier.  It's a waste of money, it makes me feel like shit, and I'm afraid I'll turn into my father/grandfathers if I don't do something about it now. 

I don't need alcohol to feel good. I use it as a crutch in social situations because I often feel uncomfortable. That's not healthy. 

I'm still scared. But I think that's good...",53,0

I chugged half a can of fosters beer after a particularly long trail race. A week prior I’d had a neat whiskey with my dinner. I didn’t think I had a drinking problem. 

Maybe I didn’t have a drinking problem? I’d just navigated a divorce without resorting to binge drinking, and had plenty of beer, wine, and whiskey all around me.  Despite all that, I only drank a few nights a week and rarely got drunk. 

Looking back I’d done plenty of stupid things throughout my life. I’ve blacked out. I’ve drank to the pukes and spins more times than I can remember. Drank at work over the years. Going out to bars every night of the week.  But I’d found a healthier way to drink. Only a drink or two at a time. Not drinking every night. Avoiding hard stuff. It was pretty healthy, right?

I was dating a recovering alcoholic, who is now almost two years sober and my wife. I had toned the drinking down since we had started dating and it just kind of happened. Around the holidays she mentioned that she hadn’t seen me drink a glass of wine, or have a beer for some time. That’s when I realized that I hadn’t felt like shit at all for those last two months. No random headaches that lasted all day. Stomach was on point. Head clear as I could remember. 

I didn’t need to get drunk to have drinking derail the whole next day. It just always happened and I accepted it without question. 

Drinking had been profoundly impacting how I felt, how productive I was, and it certainly was having an effect on my health. I was drinking “the healthy way” and I had no idea how much it was damaging so many parts of my life until it was gone, and I had the clarity of hindsight. 

Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t a conscious choice, and since it became deliberate I’ve had to consciously examine my relationship with alcohol. It hasn’t been easy. I am still sober and happy to be this way. I’ll choose clarity and control over a drink every day going forward.

I'm about half way through and I love it. I intend on buying the actual book so I can mark particularly poignant parts, and I would like to keep the audio file after this subscription ends as I imagine listening whilst doing every day tasks will help me remember why drinking isn't helping me.

I can't say it's worked to completely convert me yet, but I'm not finished it yet and my thoughts towards drinking have changed more than I could make them in years of trying.

I hope by the end I see things very differently, but honestly if I don't, I'm going to read it at least once more, maybe 3 times, till her message sinks in.

I hadn't drank for two months until the day we were told to work from home back in March. Since then, it has been a blur. I have managed to get a couple days sober here and there, but I have really been struggling to stay on the wagon. I guess part of it is maybe lack of structure in my day. No real outlets when I have a bad day. My gym just opened back up, but do I want to go there? I do have a bike, so I need to use it more.

When I have any stress, I immediately turn to alcohol. When I decide I want to clean my apartment or do other things, I turn to alcohol. When my boss calls me and asks for something that is pointless and also a huge pain in the ass, I turn to alcohol. There is no reason for any of this.

So I woke up this morning, desperately thirsty and foggy-headed as always, and I determined to do something different today. Usually, I get up, put the same exact concert on YouTube and start binging on internet news (which I refresh all day) until I feel like eating something and counting the hours until I can start drinking again without passing out by 6pm.

Today, I am not watching YouTube until it's time to relax for the day, when I am winding down. I do believe in staying informed, but I will read the news tonight after the day is over. I have lots of things I want to do with my days. I don't need alcohol to do them and alcohol keeps me from doing them. 

I need to embrace life on its own terms. I'm a pessimist by nature. I think life kind of blows. But it blows more than it needs to because of how much alcohol has stolen from me - money, mental and physical health, life experiences forfeited to sit on my couch and drink alone. Find healthier ways to deal with the stresses of life. Acknowledge it. Get it done. Hop on the bike or do some push-ups. If I get one of those infuriating calls from work, just get it done and then work on applying for jobs. Get some control. Get a grip.

I blew The Sober Thing once before in 2016. That ain’t happening to me again!,"I’d been sober from 1/1/13 to 3/3/16. THREE YEARS, 2 MONTHS & 3 DAYS. And it fell apart on me in an instant. It was one word said to me by a close neighbor & I was drinking again within seconds. LIBATION was that word. We were moving from Coronado, CA to Cincinnati, OH. Coronado is my home. My home. Hurts to even type that. It is nothing less than Heaven On Earth in Coronado. BUT in Cincinnati, we get to be grandparents! Here’s a tip: If one is lucky enough to be from Southern CA, NEVER send your first born son to an out of state college! NEVER! Because he will meet an intelligent, wonderful & beautiful girl from Cincinnati, OH & he will smartly marry her.  Cause you didn’t raise an idiot. They will move home for a year and a half, but when she wants to have a baby, she will want to be near her mother. She loves you, but she will want HER Momma. I got that. It was the best year and a half of my life having them there in Coronado. Meeting R1 at the movies once a week on our bikes, him volunteering at the Community Center on The Strand, teaching guitar lessons to ridiculously rich children. They moved back to Cincinnati. We put our 3 on 1 up for sale. I’d bought it when I was 23 and out of Nursing School for 4 years. I loved it. My first home. My Nursing School friends laughed at me for buying the homes. They all bought 280 ZXs! The Realtor said that I was asking too much money for my property, million & 475, he said it would be a couple years before it sold or I lowered the price. I was comfortable with that. I didn’t want to leave, but again, I wanted to be an involved Gram Cracker, as A calls me.The property sold on the first fucking day. To a cash buyer no less. I hated the buyer. I still hate her now for getting my fantastic life. Back to Libation...I was in the front yard crying & a neighbor across the street invited me over for a “Libation”. Don’t ever go there my friends. The pain that Libation caused was permanent. The Rock Bottom Day could have killed me. That was 9/16/16. I could have lost fucking everything. I got my shit together, sort of. But NOW, I really have my shit together in The Drink Department. For the past 10 days my beloved Husband has been in severe Atrial Fibrillation, then CHF. In the hospital for 5 of those days. Sent home yesterday, STILL in AFIB, just not at 300 beats per minute. They will Cardiovert him next month, ya know, if he’s still alive, once the blood clots seen on the TEE yesterday, dissolve & are Absorbed back into his system.. HR now hovering around the 120s.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Whew! Feeling much more rested today everyone hahaha. Hope everyone else's weeks are going well.  
  
So, like most people... I didn't decide to quit drinking because everything was going splendidly. The days of my most grandiose fuck ups were actually long behind me, but there was no doubt that the road I was on was going DOWN hill in a hurry. At only 34 years old, I was starting to feel very worried about my health and what it might look like if I didn't change. I am self employed and work without direct supervision, so with no one to keep me accountable, I often let myself get really behind and then spend weeks being anxious about how behind I was, constantly worried that I would one day get caught off guard and be found out. And financially... I was a mess. After already having been through a bankruptcy in my 20s, I was well on my way down that path again, and running out of resources. 50 days before I quit drinking, I found myself in a situation where I didn't have enough money to cover all my bills, and ended up taking out a high interest loan (well... INCREASING the already existent high interest loan I had).   
  
Today I paid that loan in full, 26 MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. In the last few weeks, I've taken on two additional clients and while some days I still struggle a little with concentration and accountability (damn social media lol!) I never waste entire days too hungover to accomplish anything, and have the drive to catch up quickly if I fall behind a little. And health wise... I don't know. I haven't lost any weight or have any concrete numbers... but I definitely don't feel like I am knocking on death's door, and I sure hope I have many many good years ahead still. I had some bloodwork done last summer and while the doctor definitely said ""You drink way too much"" he seemed to think that most of the damage was reversible!!! 
  
So tell me... what have you accomplished/bettered in sobriety? Or what do you WANT to accomplish?

5 years ago I was frequently complimented on my appearance, but now I can't remember the last time that happened. I don't mind other people's perception that much (I am already married to a great woman) but I do feel embarrassed when people point out how much I've ""changed"". 

I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've gone to bed sober in the last 3 years. Any time that I am busy until after 9 pm I start getting moody because there's 'not enough time' to drink as much as I wish, unless I stay up late. I drink at least half a bottle of liquor each night, and often have 2-4 beers on top of that. The longest I've gone without drinking in recent memory was 2 days, and that was because I was on medication (I was actually supposed to stop drinking for 10-14 days).

Lately I've been feeling worse and worse each morning, the last 4 mornings have been so bad that each time I told myself I needed to stop. Yet, each evening I 'relax' with a whiskey/beer, which soon becomes 6-12 drinks. 

This morning was the first time I have felt a burning desire to stop, though. Not ""I should stop because I'm going to kill myself eventually"", but ""I'm going to stop because it will be great"". I am excited when I think about how much better I'll feel in a week or a month, or maybe even a year, though I'm just thinking in terms of day-by-day at the moment.

In November of 2018, I had an alcohol withdrawal seizure, resulting in a fractured humerus and dislocated shoulder. I spent days in the hospital detoxing on anti-seizure meds before having surgery to repair the fracture, which included having a plate and six screws put in.  You would think a near-death experience like that would surely wake me up and lead to lasting sobriety, right?! Wrong. 

What happened was that I was able to stay sober for a brief period before going off the rails and checking myself into rehab in May. I completed a 30-day program, confident that I would remain clean. I was able to stay on track for a while before slipping, once again, into the depression and despair of alcoholism. This time though, it was worse.  I was drinking first thing in the morning, during my 10-12 hours shifts at work, saving just enough to put me out for the night at home, and starting that cycle over again the next day. All totaled, I was drinking probably close to a handle a day. The shakes were so bad; I was terrified of having another seizure every day. In one attempt at sobriety, I got a prescription taper of Librium from my primary care physician so that I would be able to go on a trip with my partner across the country without dying. 

I had no purpose in life, and I knew damn well I was slowly killing myself. I just didn't care anymore. I was depressed, and, equally as concerning, had no direction in my life. More than once, I contemplated taking my own life.  All the while I was quietly doing incomprehensible damage to myself, I was simultaneously putting my partner through the most unimaginable psychological and emotional pain possible. The lying and deceit, coupled with the worrying and uncertainty surrounding my health, both mental and physical, took a massive toll on our relationship. Although my partner has remained incredibly supportive throughout my recovery, my battle with alcohol, in the end, cost me my partnership.  

In January, I checked back into rehab with a renewed commitment to continued sobriety, and here I am, six months sober!! I've taken an opportunity to intern at a rehab facility for three months post-treatment and am now certified as an addiction counselor. Time spent throughout the program and now as a counselor has gifted me with a revitalized dedication to sobriety. While I recognize that I still have TONS of work to do, I can finally say that I'm once again happy. I have an opportunity now to use my experiences to help others through their addictions and personal battles of recovery - something that has given me the purpose and direction that my life, during my addiction, was sorely lacking.   
I'm fortunate enough to have an opportunity to rebuild a healthy relationship with my ex-partner. However, I'm still able to acknowledge the fact that they're going to need time to heal from the damages done, and now, with a bright, clear, and clean mind and soul, I can hold space within myself to allow that to happen at its' own pace.  

As I approach my thirtieth birthday (July 4th), I am optimistic about my future. But, more importantly, I am proud of being a part of the sober community. This group, even though this is my first post, has been a valuable inspiration for me throughout my recovery. On days that I've struggled with internal battles of wanting to drink, this sub has been there for me as a source of reassurance that I'm on the right path. To anyone questioning whether or not they can do it, allow yourself to recognize the fact that you're here on this sub. That alone requires the awareness that a lot of people just don't have when trying to get sober.

I feel so guilty that my husband doesn’t just come out with it but instead protects me and allows me to save face by downplaying it as a mental health thing.

Back to waking up confused at first, not feeling good all day, and drinking again that night before the hangover wore off. A few days ago I got really depressed and introspective thinking about how well I had done, sleeping regularly, more productive days, etc. Then I thought about where I was at the moment, not able to put a coherent thought together, telling my fiancee the same thing iv told her 3 nights in a row without recollection, and still pouring another drink as I loose my grip on active consciousness. It's time to do it forever, no more thinking I can controll this, it's odd for me that I have zero controll over my actions in this area but I have to accept it. And I would warn anyone who truly has a problem to avoid the ""I can moderate"" trap it's only gonna cause you more problems later, as i again am having real trouble sleeping and getting back to a sober routine.

I'm anti-social and while a lot of this Covid-Quarantine has been just fine, I'm finding that I want and NEED the support of someone else, someone without a problem. I want to be sober and I don't know how to get past 21 days without celebrating my sobriety with a drink. 

I want to tell my mom, my only close relative. I want her to understand why my behavior on our phone calls has been erratic. I want her to know that those days where I was crying over a small thing that she dismissed, I was actually going through the mental withdrawal symptoms of being an alcoholic. So how do you tell your mom or dad? Does it even help?

I tried to tell my closest friends and that failed. Our couple friends, they dismissed it with ""oh everyone drinks!"" and then they invited us to a brewery the next week. Another friend knows, but doesn't ever talk about it or ask how I'm doing. And the one time I tried to tell my only real girl-friend, she looked so horrified when I said I ""sometimes"" drink  too much, I didn't dare tell her that I've been drinking almost daily for the entirety of our friendship.

* Creativity has gone through the roof
* Met someone and have been enjoying a relationship free of drama and turmoil
* Graduated summa cum laude with my MFA
* Quit my crappy retail job and decided to focus on getting a real career so I can own a house in five years
* Done a lot of wrestling with my demons and learned to forgive myself for past mistakes
* Mended fences with a former long-term partner and fostered some real healing between us while standing up for myself
*  Started reading again, as well as having the concentration for television shows and movies

It's Day 2 and I'm doing ok. Yesterday was awful. And today the rational guilt is settling in.

I haven't made a fool of myself in years. I've been maintaining. But he knows I'm an alcoholic. I say those words out loud to him as often as I can stand it but I WON'T utter the words, ""I'm gonna quit drinking."" I know those words mean nothing to him and will only fill him with despair.

We've been together for 13 years. We've both traumatized each other in different ways over the years. My issue has always been drinking.

I took the leap (and huge paycut) from my cush factory job into the Cannabis industry because I've dreamt of it for years. It's going well!

But this drinking...I have to stop. I can't do this anymore. It's exhausting for me and for him.

Yesterday he cared for our son while I was a useless blob on the couch. Today he was short with me a few times because he's overly exhausted from yesterday, working overnight, and waking with our son this morning. It was hard for me to not point it out. But I sucked it up. Offered to do the dishes for him, no thanks, so I walked away. He's been sleeping upstairs since about 11am. I'm not gonna bother him.

I spent the morning/afternoon outside with my son. He played in the pool while I browsed this sub. I'm not hungover like I was yesterday but I'm still very tired.

We love each other so much. We're so bad at it tho. My drinking and his own faults that luckily don't involve substance abuse thankfully.

I just don't want to tell him I'm trying again. If I tell him I feel like I'll fail him. Telling him will jinx me, I know it.

I know the best way I can show him that I love him and our family is to put down the booze for good. I KNOW THIS.

But I really don't want to get his hopes up.

It's been interesting seeing my mind set shift as I get started on this new commitment. This morning I a felt sense of pride and optimism much similar to what I would feel early on in my sobriety. I forgot what this felt like. For the first time since I hit my 1 year of sobriety, I am feeling excitement to keep this going.

It's interesting to me to realize how that feeling of excitement went away as I focused less on why I stopped drinking, and just sort of moved through life. It's making me realize that for me it's going to be important that I maintain my commitment to focusing on why I'm in recovery in the first place. Not reminding myself of the why makes me forget the pain and struggle that came with drinking, and forgetting that pain and struggle eventually leads me to thinking I'm fine and I can drink again.

I'm feeling good. I'm excited for this optimism I'm feeling, and I'm proud of myself for taking control of my recovery when it felt like it was starting to slip away from me.

I have been pushing for this goal of 1 year since I decided to get sober. I made it and I’m sitting at 371 days today. I’m elated, grateful, etc. 

What’s next now? I don’t know. I guess I’ll set new goals, set a new date? 

I’ve accomplished a lot this past year. I got a new job that I LOVE. My relationships with family are worlds better and I have made incredible new friends, who are not sober, and still support me 100%. Ive redone my apartment and it finally looks like a home instead of a crash pad. I’ve picked up new hobbies and old ones I had fallen away from. It has truly been a beautiful year of self-growth. 

I lost a dear friend to this disease in Jan. The last thing we did together was make apple juice for her daughter. I bought a juicer and think of her fondly anytime I make a juice. Another dear friend almost lost her life when she ODd on her DOC about a month ago. She is still here but she is hurting. Sober and hurting. 

I feel so selfish and unworthy some times that I have made it to a year and my friend never will and that my other dear friend still struggles so much. 

New goals: 

Lose an additional 30lbs 
A 30-day meat free challenge 
Finish my degree 
Continue to improve my credit score 
Save money for a deposit towards a house 

So I guess that’s what the next year holds. I guess we just keep moving forward, one day at a time. Letting it all fall into place instead of screwing ourselves by picking up when the emotions are too raw and difficult to navigate. 

If you are on day 1 or year 1 keep going. The changes happen. It isn’t easy. It is damn well worth it though.

I do feel much better, I’m not in a pit of despair anymore, but I’m not a chipper chickadee yet either. The one thing that I’ve noticed over the last 2 days is how utterly exhausted I am... why am I so dang tired?

I’ve slept so much in the past 2 days, and yet anytime I get up I could almost immediately fall back asleep again at any moment. I’ve never been this sleepy all day every day before. I’m not a caffeine drinker, I’ve always been rather sensitive to it, but maybe it’s time to give coffee a go? I don’t really know how this works or what the deal is.

Otherwise I’m doing okay, but still dealing with major feelings of guilt. I have one more apology to make, this one to my neighbor, but I haven’t seen him out in the driveway in a few days and I don’t particularly want to go knocking. I’m still putting a little bit of time between my bad weekend and my apology just so I can make it through the words without a total breakdown. Once I get through that I think I can actually begin to start healing emotionally. I do just want to get it over with though. I don’t really know what I’m going to say, but I know that I have to apologize.

I'm a 40M, living in a country with a very strong alcohol culture. First drink at 12, a little glass of champagne at every family gathering, because eh that's the tradition. Started to really drink at 15, heavily. Started smoking weed and tobacco at 16. After 18, I was drunk almost on a daily basis. Strong beers and wine.

Alcohol ruled over my life during 25 years. It's hard to write.

All the friends I met have been drinking buddies more than friends. I've been part of the punk scene and involved in far-left politics for 15 years, just because alcohol and addictions are socially acceptable in these circles. Then friends started to get really sick, addicted, many died.

8 years ago I've started to struggle with money, lost several jobs in a row. I was acting stupid, coming late at the office, my cognitive skills were declining. I worked as a video game developer back then, another social context where alcohol is really a huge problem among workers. 

I started to recover by first quitting weed back then, that was a easy step. My mental health quickly got better.

Gradually, I slowed down my alcohol intake, getting really drunk two times a week. I became friend with several sober former punks. I've learnt a lot from them. They were going to sauna on a weekly basis to deal with their former addictions, and it became an habit for me too. Feeling my body and my mind clean and clear after saunas really triggered a drive to recover.

I met a woman 6 years ago, moved with her. She was trying to stay sober in the beginning, but after a couple of months, it became pretty obvious that she also had a huge drinking problem since many years too. She got pregnant. I stopped tobacco back then, that was REALLY hard. That was 5 years ago.

During pregnancy, she stopped drinking alcohol. So it also became easier for me to slow things down with my drinking. Then our daughter arrived. I became a father. That really nourished the will to stop every addiction. I slowed down to getting drunk only once a week. 

My girlfriend was still drinking heavily. She was getting really angry easily, really rude in front of the baby. Slowly it became obvious that she had a toxic behavior. She was bullying me to bring money in, and booze for her. She had no job. 

And finally, at the end of November last year, I came back from work, and the house was empty. She had moved all her stuff from our apartment, and my 4yo daughter was gone missing. She accused me of domestic violence, harassing her, that was honestly a complete bullshit. My daughter is living with her since then.

That was a huge shock, but also a relief. I kept on drinking for a while, and then the Covid19 arrived. I was in lockdown and working from home since then.

I've stopped drinking totally at the beginning of the lockdown. That was really hard, but I took the decision after discovering this sub. This sub was my support group since then.  I've replaced TV and booze with cycling and reading.

I don't think I'll drink anymore, ever. 

Since I've quit :

\- I got a huge promotion at work (!)

\- I'll most likely have my daughter full custody in 3 months according to the court (!)

\- saved enough money to buy a brand new car (!)

\- my cognitive skills have skyrocketed.  

I can't thank all of you enough.",23,3

First time posting in a while, however I have been visiting daily! 

I have been sober without a drop of alcohol for a little over 5 weeks now(!!) after drinking heavy (and almost daily) for the past 15+ years. I no longer have the feeling of NEEDING to drink or feeling nauseous from not drinking.  

I am a very humble person but I must say I am very damn proud of myself for this. I honestly don't think I could have accomplished this without you all so I sincerely thank you all. Every social gathering whenever someone offers me a drink I've turned it down and walked away and immediately came to this group. It hasn't failed me yet!

One thing I am really struggling with now that I am sober is getting the damn edge off. What do you all do to relax? I already exercise a lot and reading is not really my thing - I need to be physically doing something.

So with the start of a 3 day weekend coming up in the US what are you all going to do to take the edge off??

He went to an inpatient treatment centre for a month, and was doing pretty okay until mid-May. By pretty okay, I mean he had his ups and downs, and I'd say he was white knuckling it until he finally justified a relapse and cracked, but up until then he was sober. He was pretty much the epitome of dry vs. sober, if you're familiar with AA parlance. 

I'm really worried for him. His addiction is super strong, and he's fully back to morning whiskey without admitting a shred of remorse or any resolve to stop. His addiction is literally killing him, actively and in real time. It's heartbreaking to watch. 

Does anybody have any experience with this? I'm still early in my sobriety, so I can't provide a lot of advice or experience. I know that people can't stop until they're emotionally ready, and I'm concerned that confronting him with the consequences of his actions on me will only push him further away. Having said that, I feel that I have to try something. As well as being newly sober, I'm not in the program and have no experience with people stepping out or what to do.

I quit doing hard drugs 11 years ago and picked up the bottle. Been trying to quit drinking for the past 7 years. 
I e had a lot of personal trauma that has kept me glued to the bottle. Most recently my dog passed away suddenly. I have a major affinity to animals and it was quite crushing. I used the pain to fuel my desire to quit. I have only had a few drinks since March 17. 
Last night was one of them. I’m having a bbq for the Fourth of July and it set off a major trigger for me. I succumbed and drank a fifth of vodka last night. 

I turned into that person I hate, doing all that shit that I despised. And now I’m hungover and disgusted with myself...again. And in my mind I’m just like, WHY?! Why did I pick up that bottle and even TRY?! One more time?
I feel like crap. I’ve been throwing up all morning and I don’t even feel like I even enjoyed myself last night. 
But you know what guys? I think I FINALLY GET IT. 

I will not drink with you TODAY. 

I bought an extra little bottle for the party in hopes I wouldn’t drink too much while we had company. 
I just told my husband to pitch it. I don’t even fucking want it anymore. And I hope I feel this way for the rest of my life. 

Thanks for this sub. I’ve tried AA, and counseling but none of it stuck. I like this sub because I see myself in all your stories. 
I see the hurt, the pain, the confusion. The desire yet not the will to quit in all of us. And I’m grateful for people like you who have the courage to share those stories. It truly helps.",74,0

I grew up suicidal since the age of ten. The thought of killing myself occurred regularly and passed, just like a momentary feeling of hunger. I'm 29 now (started medications at 25 - way too late. Daily thoughts of hurting or killing yourself is abnormal. You don't have to be like this, see your doctor. If you never had suicidal thoughts before using, you probably just need to quit, obligatory ""not a doctor."") and living a life I thought I left behind in my youth.

I was you, looking at the guy with 6 months, 9 months, a year, wondering how the fuck could I possibly pull that off. The answer is through the twelve steps and finding a higher power to trust, one you can feel safe sharing your issues, problems, and gratefulness with. The only thing in the way is your belief that you know what is best for you, or anyone. Let that go and you become free enough to let go of your vice.

Compared to my college student peers you could think I’m on the more reasonable side when it comes to drinking!

But I know that I’m probably the least healthy drinker of my friends.

I got sober when I got depressed and started taking antidepressants. That was 7 months ago.

Last week I turned 21. I stayed sober through my 21st birthday (US). It was tough but I was proud of myself for doing it. That was last Tuesday.

Then last Friday I went down to the liquor store and snuck a bottle past my roommate into my room. I kept thinking about drinking. At a certain point I almost didn’t even want to drink so much as I wanted to stop thinking about it. I started drinking by myself on Saturday but actually didn’t get drunk because I knew the meds can fuck your tolerance. 

Sunday I made another attempt at getting drunk.  I started drinking around 11am by myself. Still didn’t get very drunk though because apparently my tolerance is not as low as I expected.

Monday I think about drinking but don’t. Tuesday night I dip out from hanging out with my roommates, take some shots, and rejoin them. I’m the only one drinking.

Yesterday I dipped out from my roommates again so I could take some shots. I thought about drinking earlier in the afternoon but held off until evening.

I know the way I drink is different from my friends even though plenty of them drink more than I do. But they don’t get drunk by themselves. Or get drunk by themselves in the day. Or drink straight vodka. Or stay sober for their 21st then immediately jump into near-daily drinking...

I made it through so many parties where I was possibly the only sober person. I just want to be “normal” and have fun without turning into an alcoholic. But I’m not sure that’s in the cards for me...

I hate my stupid brain that’s terrible at moderation. My whole family barely even drinks and I’m not aware of anyone who’s a sober alcoholic. My parents have an occasional glass of wine and that’s it.

I woke up today dizzy. I’m still kind of dizzy. I feel almost like I’m tipsy when I haven’t drank at since last night and I really didn’t drink that much...",7,0

I don't know if this is a place for me to post given I haven't committed to give up drinking permanently, and my approach WOULD NOT SUIT many people here who know what they need to do. But I want to say that I didn't arrive here because everything was going great.

I really hate the day after. I'm so tired. You knew you'd feel like this. Austin's crying tho and you have to get up. Downstairs. I'll just take a quick breather on the couch and then get going.

START awake and sprint into the kitchen. Austin sits on the floor with an empty hand sanitizer bottle and a gelatinous mound on the floor in front of him. Stupid. What's wrong with me?
Diaper, breakfast, milk...God I'm just so tired. I'll just go sit down again.
""Gooutside? Mommy? Outside? Wanna go outside?""
""No, bubby. Mommy's sleepy.""
We watch Incredibles 1&2 and my husband wakes.
Just a little nap to recoup and then we can get moving.

Austin's napping. I'm still exhausted. My wonderful husband smiles at me and kisses my forehead. I'm a piece of shit. 
I sleep more on the couch. 

My husband says he'll fill the kid pool if I get Austin ready for outside. Ok... sluggish. Ugh. I just wanna sit down. MOVE!

He loves the water. He's splashing and playing. I'm so tired. I'm watching a movie on the laptop outside while he plays. I'm too tired to play.

Time for bed. My son grabs my hand and leads me upstairs for night night cuddles. We climb into bed and I snuggle up to him. He looks at me lovingly ""Look at all these friends! I love you mommy."" I weep quietly until I hear his breathing deepen and his body relax. 
Scoop him up and lay him gently in his crib. He sleeps soundly. Tears fall down my face. I don't deserve him.

I have been following this page for a while, but never posted.

In general, I struggle to stop drinking once I start. One wine always turns to 6!

Because of this high intake I struggle with acid reflux and a whole bunch of fun things which a 30 year old female should not struggle with. Essentially I want alcohol to have less control of my life.

With July starting (Dry July Inspiration) I think my best approach is starting fresh!  My plan in winding down... I.e. 4 drinks a week rather than 4 a night. With the long term goal of no alcohol (as I don't feel I can moderate it)

So...

1. What tips do people have for dealing with temptation? I live with my parents due to COVID so am dealing with multiple fridges for just alcohol - so bringing nothing into a house is not an option.

2. Would you recommend cold turkey or winding down?

\- to get control of my emotions, short term abstinence causing depression and anxiety.

At first it was going great in my head - no hangovers, control over my day, and pink clouds. The truth is I was will-powering my way through it. It created a huge divide between me and my wife, I was stressed out to the core, and I generally was miserable to be with. Top that with quarantine - I caved and went back to drinking.

TBH it has been ok - at least in my head. I am not getting wasted, my wife and I have connected and chilled out, and I’ve been in a better mood. I’ve experimented with some other stuff and have come to some transformations for the better. I have not gone on some of the violent tirades that I’ve gone under in the past.

All of this is great but I still feel like my inner world
is crumbling a bit. I’m drinking because I don’t have a clear direction. I’m in a job that is pretty dead end and although it pays decent - it doesn’t fill me up. I make excuses and I don’t advance because yea other things or other people.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m interested in the concept of surrender. I recognize the benefits of sobriety but I can’t willpower this shit. I don’t know how to surrender and just ride the wave of living a good fucking life. Happy with who I am without substances and present.",5,1

Have a great couple hours chatting, reminiscing and catching up etc. Once the conversation gets going you don’t even notice your “beer” is basically a Soda. 

8PM go Lime-Scootering around for a bit. Meet up with other group, meet lots of really nice people. Get introduced to some cute girls. 

845PM drive a couple of the new people you’ve met to the liquor store, they’re all super grateful. Good vibes. Get to pet a doggo while they shop. New friend brings you a free pack of non alcoholic beers for driving

915-1115 hang out at the party, chat with new people, listen to music, play beer pong and make a joke about making your buddy drink for you. Chat with the girls a bit. You’re not worried about doing or saying anything dumb at all, in fact you feel more confident and attractive because you’re aware and “the responsible person” When someone asks if you’re drinking and you say no, only the really really hammered annoying guy makes a comment about it, and everyone is annoyed by his drunkenness, not your sobriety. 

1130 drive home without a worry in the world about checkstops or anything. Get a text from friend saying the girl you were talking to wants to hang out, and to text her whenever. 

1145 get home, make some tea and type this post. Knowing you can get up tomorrow at 7 and absolutely crush your day. 

The cessation of drinking does not mean your social life ends. It simply attracts you into more positive situations, which you can then appreciate more because you’re completely present for them.

After a few days she was discharged with the doctors telling her that the reason her symptoms had been ao extreme is because she had a severe drinking problem. The psychologist gave me a list of things that I could do to help her, namely I could never drink again because her being around that could cause her to relapse.

We stayed sober for a few weeks and we tempted fate and decided to try and drink a reasonable amount. It became abundantly clear that we can't control ourselves around alcohol. Finally after a few weeks I decided to put my foot down and make a decison that reguardless of what she did I wasn't going to drink anymore. I was always fine with quitting for her, but after realizing all of my plans on how to limit myself would go out the window once I had the bottle in front of me. The doctors told her she had a problem, but I realized I also had a problem, and I didn't want anything else to control my life.

My wife thinks I'm being silly. She keeps asking to drink every weekend and I keep saying no. She gets mad at me, and stops talking to me for hours after I tell her that I'm not drinking anymore. She says that if we don't drink we don't do anything or have any fun. The thing is that I don't tell her that she can't drink. How could I? Shes a grown woman with access to a car and her own money. I've told her I'm not going to enable her drinking in anyway, that I'm not going to buy it for her, and I'm not driving her anywhere if shes too drunk to drive, but I can't make decisions for her.

The fact that she isnt anywhere near my side, that she's directly opposed to me stopping is really hitting me hard. I've asked her to stop asking me to drink. To respect the choice I made, but she thinks I'm being 'silly' and it's really weighing on me. 

I guess I just needed to say it somewhere. She hasn't told anyone to my knowledge about the doctors telling her she has a drinking problem, and I'm doing my best to respect her privacy and not tell anyone, but I feel like I'm all alone during a ver difficult time right now.",6,0

Few examples: I don't want to let go of the soul-crushing casual relationship, or the snooze button I hit for 2 hours every morning, or spending way too much money on unhealthy delivery so I can eat my feelings, or not leaving the house for days...

But I have been. Not all at once. Not perfectly. But it's happening. Little by little I'm correcting all these little behaviours that used to cumulatively make me feel like a fuck-up which caused me to feel anxious and drink. I'm feeling a lot stronger than I was just a few weeks ago.

1. I don't have to waste time thinking about different liquor stores to go to, to avoid seeing the same person too often.
2. I don't have to think about where to hide my bottles
3. I can kiss my wife at night.  I used to avoid it, so she wouldn't pick it up on my breath.
4. I don't have to plan to have a stock of gum, so that I can hide my breath in front of family
5. I don't have to sneak around at night, going through cupboards to find a bottle I maybe forgot about that had some liquor left
6. I don't have to lie to my wife about going to get 'takeout' at certain restaurants, only going there because I knew the food would take a while, and I could sit at the bar and get drunk as fast as possible.
7. I have normal bowel movements.
8. I can actually eat lunch without being nauseas
9. I don't have to hide liquor in water bottles when I knew I was going to a party that was just going to have beer available.
10. No cringey text messages to friends and family, that I would never normally send if I was sober.  I hate reading them the next day after a rough night of drinking.

My wife was given ok as a teenager to have a beer or wine at dinner or even at night if wanted, as long as at home.  My wife legit has never and will never have an issue with alcohol.  Mid 40’s, excellent moderation, really drunk maybe twice in 25 years I’ve known her.  My daughter is 15 and recently mom told her was ok to have one of these new White Claw things.  So she cracks one, says it’s ok, and heads to her room.  I voiced moderate concern after she left room. My wife says, “look, it’s the same as when I grew up and I’m fine. Alcohol was forbidden for you and glorified to an extent by the adults in your family (confirmed alcoholics most of them) and that’s why you grew up with an unhealthy relationship with it.”

I mean...it’s a solid argument. Not airtight, but some good points in there.  It kinda makes me uncomfortable though.  I think the reason why though is because I’m “supposed” to have a problem with it, my programming says I should.  Logically, and in the absence of my ability to foretell the future, my wife likely has a better perspective on the right move here.  Couple that with our knowing what kind of kid our daughter is, and her level of maturity, yeah it’s probably fine.  

Having said that, it’s been on my mind and wanted to run it past you folks.  Genuinely curious what the general sentiment is going to be on this subject.",8,0

It was the week before Father's Day and I was driving to work with my typical half hangover. I am the person who would sit down after the wife and kid were in bed to play video games until almost midnight with the wine glass always full. I can't honestly tell you how much I was drinking on the regular, but I bet it was 3-5 full glasses a night. It was just enough to make me feel a good headache on most mornings and like total S. once or twice a week. I would take 3 ibuprofen/3 cups of coffee to get me going. I would wander into work 5-10 minutes late and sit at my desk for half an hour and just try to function. It hasn't been a spiral for me, just consistent bad behavior.

The week before Father's Day I asked God for an answer. Asking out loud was something I've never done and I felt awkward even though I was driving to work by myself that morning. Over the next few days I went through a lot of self inflection and thought which culminated with me deciding to stop drinking on Father's Day. I want to make it one year and see where I am next Father's Day, hopefully I make it and decide to go for another year.

I wouldn't say I'm  a bad father or husband, but I just want to be the best version of myself. I found that the drinking is the only part of the equation right now that is holding me back. I must do this for myself and those around me. 

Right now it is a day to day thing, I have not had major triggers. I have noticed so many good things coming out of this already and my wife has as well.

Just wanted to share my experience a little.
I never was a heavy drinker but at one point I decided to stop drinking for a year. Just to test myself.

On New Year Eve 2018, I drank a Guinness in Belfast and this was my last alcohol drink. 

Today it's been two and a half year. 

What I realize from that is people are always pushing you to drink when you're out. I never realized that before. Now I feel bad when I pushed my friend to drink when they were out with me in the past. 

Even today some of my friend are making fun of me when I say I don't drink because they knew me before I stopped. But I don't care. I did that for myself, not for others.

If you want to stop, don't think about what other people will think. It's your decision. 

Kudos and good luck to all of you!

Around 2015-2018 I drank whiskey almost every day, blacked out often, and just generally made a fool of myself at least twice a year at a big group event. I’ve slowly phased out hard liquor, and right now just occasionally drink beer. But I’ve started to notice a cycle, I drink one beer on Monday, and am responsible and stop at one. So I’m good, and I was so responsible with beer that on Tuesday I have TWO beers. Do you see where this is going?

I’m starting to realize that there is no in-between, I have to quit drinking entirely. 

I’ve started to notice a few other things as well. My body doesn’t respond to alcohol the way it used to. I used to power through hangovers, now I’m almost bed ridden after a night out, with nausea, diarrhea, and a stomachache that lingers for days sometimes. also I find myself more forgetful if I’m drinking regularly.

I guess nobody could have ever prepared me for how hard this was going to be.

Don't get me wrong, it's been totally manageable and doable (unlike before, that was unmanageable and constant disaster).    And it's been so absolutely worth it.  My life has become such a gift, I really mean that.  There's days and moments where I just stop and say ""oh my God, wow"".  Hard to describe really.  

I say all that because I don't want to get anybody depressed about sobriety.  It truly has been a gift.

But I also have to be honest about the struggles, too.  My struggles, at least.  Everyone's journey is different I suppose.  

The last couple of days I've been hit with another wave.  The kind of thing that makes me ask myself if it's all worth it.  What the crap is even the point of all this if I'm just going to end up in the same stupid rut in the end?  Yeah.  I'm frustrated.

And I'm super down on myself for not being able to get a handle on this.  I feel like I *should* be better than this by now.  7 years? Come on man.  And after everything you've been through and learned?  Come on, dude.  

Ahhhhh.  It sucks.  It's such a crappy feeling.

And I guess I should count my blessings.  Because I'm still sober. My girlfriend is so supportive.  I have a good job and there's a lot of positive things going on in my life.

But it still feels so crappy.  As much as I wish I could just wish that feeling away, I can't.  That's what I did with alcohol.  Now I have to sit with it.

I don't know what to do.  The crap that came up, I don't know what to do about it.  I honestly don't.  I'm at a loss.  All I can think to do is live in the moment.  One moment at a time.  See what happens.  Trust.  That's always worked for me.

It's funny, but I feel powerless.  That's the term they taught me in AA.  I identified immediately with it.  I knew that I couldn't lick this thing.  It had me beat, absolutely beat, and I knew it. Well I feel similarly right now.  The good news is that now I'm used to working in this space... I know where the magic comes from.  So I'm not floundering around so much.  

All I can do is let go, let God.  That attitude has never let me down, never.  

Still feels crappy though.  But hey.  It's kind of a welcome reminder that, it's OK mate, you don't need to do anything... life's got you.  There's some comfort in that. I will keep leaning in to and wait for a miracle.  They have always come.

Just needed to get this out.  My GF is wonderful support but I lost touch with many of my friends from early sobriety.  Sometimes I just need to talk to sober folk.  They understand.  I welcome any thoughts, encouragement, etc.

**1980ish:** I start sneaking the odd sip of booze

**1984:** I start getting drunk and high with friends

**1986:** Partying pretty much every weekend

**1988:** I get scared about the path I'm on and get sober

**1989:** After a year sober, I decide I'm cured of alcoholism & celebrate by getting drunk

**1998:** After nine years that are a lot shitter than they need to be, I get sober again

**1999:** After another year sober, I decide once again that I'm cured of alcoholism and celebrate by getting drunk again, and staying that way

**1999-2010:** A very long blur of drunkenness and hangovers, punctuated by marriage, children, and career stuff, all of which goes way better than I deserve, considering the fact that I'm basically a drunken bum who just hasn't ended up in the gutter yet. I'm not exaggerating. I'm drunk at least five nights a week and horribly hung over the rest of the time. I lose entire days to hangovers. 

**2010:** Wife tells me that being the only person drinking at my little girl's birthday party at 11 am is not a good look, and she's thinking about leaving soon if I don't stop. I quit drinking on the spot. It feels like a huge relief, finally... as if I needed permission from someone else to stop. I've tried dozens of times before, maybe hundreds. This time, though, it sticks. To me, this is proof that willpower would never be enough for me to stop. I need to make a quantum leap in consciousness, which I am able to do by seeing myself for a moment through her eyes. What I see is pretty terrifying.

**2011:** I stumble onto r/stopdrinking (population <200) and eventually become a mod for a while, helping grow the community from a few hundred to I forget how many thousands, and gaining immeasurable gifts from my interactions with you all along the way. Thank you!

**2012:** I start attending AA sessions irregularly. It helps, though eventually I just get bored. Yet I know I need a community. SD is everything to me in this area, because I get to talk to people about alcoholism any time I want, but without religion popping up. In AA meetings, I find that because of my work here on SD, I already know the language. I also learn they talk about all the same stuff we talk about here, except it's 24/7 and it's actually a lot easier to feel like you're being heard on SD than in real meetings, which are often loud and inefficiently run and never long enough for everyone to talk. Although digital interaction has its limitations and weaknesses, it also carries some benefits. SD is a good place.
 
**2020:** One day at a time. Here we are.

It's a big year for me, because I also turn 50 this summer. That means I managed to get through my 40s without a single sip of booze--I had my last drink at age 39. In order for this to mean something to you, you would have had to have known me when I was drinking. I was insatiable. I was unstoppable. I was legendary for all the wrong reasons. My absolute main concern in life was getting more booze. Everything else was secondary. The fact that I am free of that feels like a miracle.

If you're thinking about quitting drinking but aren't sure, let me just say this: no one ever regretted drinking *too little* the morning after. I certainly have never regretted not drinking... never once. Cravings? Yes. Moments of weakness? Of course. Relapse? Not today.

Need help keeping it that way.,"As the title says, I (31M) have been sober for six years. I started drinking when I was barely a teenager after two traumatic incidents, coupled with repeated bullying as a child. I drank to fit in with the only people that I could do at the time. Unfortunately it very quickly became a crutch. 

Fast forward into my adulthood and I spiralled to that point when you’re looking down the slippery slope and somehow managed to put the breaks on before I lost my job. It was a struggle, but I did it and have been completely sober ever since. Unfortunately I never found another crutch, and my mental health I feel has actually worsened. 

Fast forward again, and my marriage has fallen apart and now my mind is as well. I’ve found myself craving hard the release that alcohol will bring. Knowing how easy I will spiral into a dark place with it, I’ve managed to resist. But recently I’ve been abusing tramadol to get me through, have run out of diazepam and spend my evenings in a complete pit of despair. 

That Devil on my shoulder is telling me that alcohol is the lesser of the evils here. That having a drink is better than abusing pain medication for escapism. I tell myself I can control it. That enough time has passed for me to start again and drink sensibly like a normal person. 

The other part of me is floundering, and whilst I don’t think I’m on the immediate verge of running out tonight, I certainly was yesterday and I likely will be again very soon. 

Has anyone else found themselves stuck in this predicament? Tramadol is not good for me, and I had an accidental overdose the other night resulting in violent sickness the next day. But the high and the release it gives me draws me back to it. I avoided it yesterday, and am for tonight, but I know it’s inevitable that I will return to it. Would it really be so bad if I had even the smallest amount, measured out, to just give me that calming feeling? I suffer from intrusive thoughts, and I hate being fully with it. 

With my wife gone and a new partner I see only every few days, I’m alone in this house, stuck with my demons and little light at the end of the tunnel. 

Sorry this post got longer than I thought. TL:DR - sober six years and life events are causing me to crave a release that I’m getting from prescriptions meds. Questioning whether to allow drink back into my life, but the reality is I likely wouldn’t be able to control it and would make things worse.

We were in the shop, my friend was choosing his beers, and I thought i was going to break. Thankfully my hand reached out and chose a non-alcoholic beer. Maybe my 'sober muscle' is starting to grow? Choosing the NA beer was almost an unconscious act despite my mental struggle. I'm very grateful!

He's only seen recently seen me at parties or in very stressful situations, so he hasn't seen the months of working on moderation. But I've spent too many quarantine days feeling sorry for myself and hiding in a bottle of wine.

Like any self- harm, it might seem like an emotional release in the moment, but then there's the aftermath. I started with moderation, going from being a nightly drinker to a couple nights a week, but once I get going I don't want to stop. Last years DUI was enough to get me to try to put the brakes on it, but I'm getting my license back on friday and want to make absolutely sure that the sneaky part of my brain that thinks I can get away with things NEVER gets control again. I've been a lurker on here off and on, but I'm back to announce my fresh day one and hang with all you beautiful people that are shedding the burden of alcohol from your life.

Husband doesn't want me to quit totally, and I think I wasn't totally ready either. I halfheartedly tried earlier this year and had made some progress by April/May (not total sobriety, but had cut back and was finally stringing together multiple sober days back to back), but then slid straight back to where I was before that. Nothing bad has happened; no blow up fights with spouse, no embarrassing social moments, no blackouts, but... This Naked Mind has gotten into my head. Like, what am I getting from alcohol? NOTHING, except for a giant gut (I've gained like 30 lb and am now overweight), less healthy liver, tanked immune system, and less dollars in my bank account. Screw it. I care about myself. I care about my body. Tired of feeling sick and tired. 

So, today, I'm back here and trying again - this time I feel like I am really ready to make changes. My plan is to talk to my therapist frequently, stock my fridge with NA beverages and NA beer (it helps when husband grabs a beer if I have a similar go-to), keep ice cream and cheese (other guilty pleasures) on hand, and avoid the wine aisle of the grocery store like the plague. I can't wait to feel healthier again. Thanks for all of your inspiring posts that keep me coming back and giving sober life a try. IWNDWYT!",3,1

Trigger 1 - kids had a treat junk food dinner which means no family meal together which would normally mean hubby and I drink as much wine as possible while I cook us our dinner.

Trigger 2 - food shop day. Don’t know why but it is.

Trigger 3 - I cooked us a big fat curry which would usually result in pre drinks while I cook, wine with the meal then probably scotch after until we pass out. 

I sound like a great parent don’t I? 

Anyway all these triggers clearly caught me off guard and I’ve spent the last hour crying because I can’t have wine. 
Like a spoilt baby. 
Crying because I can’t get shit faced. Crying because I am angry that I can’t enjoy a drink like a normal person. 
I hate this. I hate feeling like I’m missing out on something. I know I’m not missing anything.

This icebreaking you mention is just me talking shite while feeling a false sense of confidence. I can't imagine what it would be like for the poor sod who has to listen to me flapping my face - unless they were smashed as well....in which case it's probably not going to develop into a meaningful and worthwhile friendship.

I found this subreddit this morning as I couldn't sleep from withdrawal.

I have been unsuccessfully trying to quit drinking, I can make it 6 or 7 months but always end up relapsing, because I think, ""what could the harm be?"" Then I remember when the withdrawal hits.

This relapse started Friday and I tapered off yesterday.

I have been unsuccessful doing this on my own, and after seeing all the support that gets provided here and the number of people dealing with the same thing I do it gives me hope that this time, this day 1 will be the last one.",12,0

This is my very first post here. I am starting 
my journey- it's time. I have a couple of questions. I understand that I can search this sub and other places for advice, but actively reaching out to the community feels like a first step of sorts, so I do hope that this is okay. 

How do you know whether it will be safe to quit cold turkey or if you need to taper / see a doctor? I am not asking for medical advice (I will get that from a doctor), just your individual experiences with this. 

What are some tools / methods that have helped you get past the first few days, when it feels impossible to fill the time?

In general, I have not had any experiences which have inspired me to quit. No big event leading to a revalation. I've known for a while that my relationship with alcohol is not healthy and that I ""should"" do something about it, but the motivation hasn't been there. 

However, one valuable thing that I have already learned from this fine community is that I need to adjust my thinking to realize, that I need to add ""yet"" when I think something like ""well I've never had x bad thing happen"" and understand that I am on this path even if it isn't ""that bad"" (yet). So, thanks for that!

I also live in the city and have always had good public transport links so it’s never been a necessity. But I do plan to move out further out into the countryside later this year so driving will become essential.

Anyway, I’ve had a bad relationship with alcohol for years, I’ve been trying to stop for a long while but just this week have really put in the effort to commit. I’m only on day 3 but I’m really hoping to keep this up.

I was thinking of booking a crash course (high intensity learning where you aim to pass within a short period of time) to complete my driving lessons. I was looking at booking a course which is 7 hours a day for a week. It would be a big commitment in terms of not drinking. Even evening drinking would be a no go because I would be too worried about still being over the limit the next morning if I went too far (which I always do).

Obviously in my head I don’t plan to drink, but I also don’t know if the commitment of paying all that money upfront is a silly idea. Has anybody else ever done anything along these lines? Committed to something that ensures they absolutely are NOT able to drink, and had success with it? I think the sensible idea for me would be to see how I go with not drinking for a few more weeks and then maybe look at booking it.",4,0

I’ve never had a good relationship with alcohol but I worked as a sales rep for a beer company a couple of years ago and definitely developed a problem.

I have a tendency of turning to alcohol when I want to avoid stress from work or anxiety in my life. Through therapy, I have come to realize that my inclination to beer is not a desire to indulge in pleasure, but a subconscious attempt to avoid pain.

While I will be waking up hungover tomorrow, I have notified my partner that I intend to pursue sobriety for the next 30 days. I definitely wish to pursue it for longer, but I know that I need to start small and build on incremental success. 

When I think about the things that I don’t like about myself (binge eating/drinking, playing video games, avoiding responsibility) it all connects back to alcohol. It is a self-destructive vice that I have indulged in for years.

I know it’s not going to be easy, but I know it’s going to be worth it. The challenge will definitely be impacted by high stress job, but I am lucky to have a strong support system and the internal desire to change my habits. I am planning to try and post on someone else’s pledge once a day for the next 30 days. I will also be meditating and continuing to follow my training plan for running.

Besides my immediate environment, the biggest things for ensuring my success are 1) getting a good nights sleep (I am more inclined to drink when I am tired) 2) running or doing something physical on a daily basis 3) meditating  (I used to mediate for 10 minutes everyday for over a year) in order to reconstruct the relationship I have with my thoughts and feelings. 

I will also be wearing my sports watch daily, as a physical reminder that I am committed to not drinking.

so, i am 28 y/o, and this is the longest i’ve been sober from alcohol i’m pretty sure since i turned 21 and could legally drink. been struggling to get free for a few years. at the end of february i went through a major trauma involving a relapse after a month sober, sexual assault, self-harm, and consequently my life completely falling apart and being abandoned by my two best friends/housemates/only support system. 
this was all immediately followed by me being isolated in an empty house for a month and then moving/driving across the country (mi—>or), i arrived march 6th to a new city where i knew no one or nothing about, then the pandemic hits. 

so, it’s been a very difficult time. i’ve been processing and trying to cope with grief, confusion, constant isolation, anxiety & depression i’ve never experienced in my life which has caused me to lose my appetite and ability to sleep well. 

i decided to be sober april 11th, and i have kept to that, however, having legal cannabis around has been both a blessing and a curse. it has been so helpful in getting sober, but at the same time, i am relying on it now daily the same way i was with alcohol. the difference is it isn’t destructive like alcohol, but i do feel like it’s enabling me to be more of a vegetable than i am already becoming under the weight of everything else i am dealing with. 

i think some questions i have are: is this just what getting sober feels like? is it always this painful and hard? thoughts on using cannabis as a bridge to coping with new sobriety? 

i just feel like i’m starting to really lose it and to top it all off the one person i have been texting with seems to have ghosted me. i’ve never been lonelier in my life. i’m trying to figure out if it’s just sobriety or if i can factor in the pandemic plus the stress of dealing with a new trauma + moving across the country solo. maybe i’m looking for validation? i don’t know.

For the last 10 it has been wine. It makes me feel normal because I use a wine glass and watch TV. I’m mostly a good drunk. Lots of laughing and happy nights. I don’t go in trouble, don’t drive drunk, don’t get in fights - So not an issue, right?!

Once I was furloughed things started to slip. It started with a few beers for after the wine. I’ve always had a 5pm limit before I drink, even on weekends - Although 3pm on a Sunday was ok, because I make the rules. Well, it soon became 3pm on any day and two bottles of wine in the last few months.

I had an argument with my 17 year old son one of the nights and was so embarrassed with myself because he was clearly upset with me but I couldn’t really remember why we fell out. That was a few weeks ago. We made up, I told him how much I love him and all good.

Back on the wine then. I have gained a lot of weight just sat getting drunk, I started to lose respect for myself and I guess my family probably felt the same. It’s worth mentioning that I also smoked cannabis for my whole life, everyday. I quit tobacco 6 weeks ago and started to vape weed instead, but this really did increase my drinking. In my head that was ok while I sorted out tobacco, but I was just lowering the bar for myself with excuses. Anyway, I’m rambling but I haven’t really talked to anyone else about this as I am embarrassed of myself, even at home.

Ok, so some good news. I’m tobacco free and have zero cravings or interest. My mum died of lung cancer two years ago so this one is important. I have not vaped weed for 57hrs. No weed or tobacco for 57hrs is a life first. But, on top of that I haven’t drank either. I have rum and beer in the kitchen and didn’t touch it. I’m so proud of myself but I feel if I told people they wouldn’t really understand as that’s normal to everyone else. I have been moody at night - In fact I went to bed at about 6pm on both nights and sat on my phone until about 11pm having waves of hotness going over my body. Sweating. Covers on, covers off. Tossing and turning over and over. Crazy dreams, I can’t really remember them, but I know there were a lot. I feel a bit groggy when I wake, but I feel like I slept ok considering. It’s 7.30am and I think I’ll take the dog for a walk before work. I want to be fitter, healthier and I don’t want people to blame me when I die for doing it to myself. I don’t want my kids to remember with blame or disappointment. They love me, we have a great relationship, but I don’t want that to change. So, today I will put on my suit and have a great day.

My anxiety was at an all time high. I was suicidal, paranoid, thought everyone hate me , my heart was always racing and would be scared with every loud sound. After a couple weeks sober I found out I was pregnant May 1,2017. I was very anxious about becoming a new mother but even then my anxiety went way down. My heart wasn’t racing and I knew my friends and family loved me.

Since the birth of my daughter 2.5 years ago I have cut down my drinking. Only drinking a once a month or so. But even when I do drink it’s send me into a depression/anxiety frenzy.

hope everyone is having an alright week so far! IWNDWYT",5,0

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Anyone who's spent any time in AA or really any recovery program have probably heard all the little quips and sayings that people like to say over and over. And honestly, even though they seem pretty dumb at first, after a while some of them really do stick with you and start to make sense.  
  
But one of the ones that really got me is: If you're not working on your recovery, you're working on your relapse.  
  
It didn't take me long to realize that my alcoholism is really just a symptom of a larger problem. Since quitting drinking I've really had to start digging deep and figuring out what's been driving this machine for so long. Some of it... is a bit chicken/egg. Was my drinking causing my anxiety/depression or was my anxiety/depression causing me to drink? Who knows!!! What I DO know is that if I don't treat these other problems, it will eventually lead back to the bottle. Removing alcohol is only PART of the solution. Now I have to actually become an emotionally healthy, mature adult HAHA.  
  
What steps are you taking in your recovery?

Im so happy that I didn’t cave. 

So whats the deal? I wonder if it’s just that I still haven’t accepted my choice to quit and am still grappling with it. If I just say I don’t drink, maybe I can skip the craving war and spend my day in moments of pride instead of indecision on my decision....",7,0
