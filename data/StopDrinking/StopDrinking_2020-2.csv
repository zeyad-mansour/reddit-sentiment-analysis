There's always tons of free booze. If I weren't sober I would have gotten totally plastered last night. But I didn't! Partly cause my boss bought be a 6 pack of grapefruit Sparkle water as a ""just in case you felt like staying for opening."" I've honestly got overwhelming support from my friends and family and it's so great.

Another note, I've found a ton of my motivation to stay sober are the no hangover foggy early mornings. I have a kid and I'm married. I cook the food in the house and when I drank it would be AWFUL having to cook the next day to the point where it would be hit or miss if I even cooked. Which meant we would spend money on eating out when we had perfectly good food at home.

This whole no drinking thing has got me far more family oriented then I ever have been and I'm just so grateful. I feel like a dodged some kind of bullet.",11

I'm 19 days sober. I went to a meeting 2 weeks ago. It was a big book meeting with approximately 150 people. I enjoyed listening to what the speaker had to say about  his experience hitting bottom  and successfully  becoming sober. Tonight, I went to an Alano meeting. There were six people there besides myself, one dude was snoring most of the time. It was a dingy ass room, warped tables, yellowed posters and papers on the wall with the old church basement type musty smell. It lasted 21 minutes and everybody rushed to get the hell out of there. So, I left there and went back to the original meeting I went to two weeks ago to get the bad taste out of my mouth. I enjoyed it about the same as last time.

My hang-up is the giving up to a higher power stuff. I'm 45 years old, and only in the last 3 weeks since stopping drinking, have I even considered how spiritual I am (not very). I am definitely not religious.

I'm not looking for anyone to help me decide if I want to invest in AA. I'm just looking to hear why it's helped you, if it has. OR, for those of you with my beliefs, or lack thereof, what have you done or what are you doing to stay sober?

Sorry in advance for the long story ahead   


Basically, I'm an alcoholic. It started when I was 16 years old, I was a high school drop out, a obese nerd with not a whole lot of friends, and nothing to do all night but drink and play games with my older brother and online friends. My 16th birthday was my introduction to alcohol, and it really clicked with me. Back then, it passed the time, and made me forget about my lack of social skills that even carried over into my online life of WoW and FPS games.  


I drank heavily, at least 7-8 beers nightly. This went on until I was 17-ish. I finally felt the detrimental effects of alcohol, although I didn't fully understand it at the time. I had my first anxiety attack. It scared the life out of me. I went to the hospital because I thought I was going to die. I quit  drinking, but suffered from the withdrawals heavily. I couldn't sleep, and saw doctors who in hindsight were terrible, because after numerous medications, they finally found one that stuck to help with my insomnia.   


Xanax. I was taking Xanax every single night for almost two years until I was 19, and my medicaid stopped. And I felt compelled to self-medicate to deal with no longer being able to take Xanax at night to aid in my sleep. In those two year periods of being sober and becoming a young adult, I turned my life around for the better. I lost a ton of weight, went from 220, to about 140, got into motorcycles, BJJ, started working part time, and my life was starting to seem normal. So when I started to introduce alcohol back into my life, it didn't seem as detrimental. A crutch, yes, but I wasn't aware of how debilitating it would become.  


I drank, every.single.night. For a while, it was sustainable, not perfect but I made do. I had a decent job at HEB, was still into motorcycles, and I wasn't aware of how it plagued my life. In hindsight, I can see how it ruined my early 20s, and made me incredibly complacent to my youth slipping away.  


At the age of 24, in 2017, I spontaneously moved across the country from Texas to Seattle and got engaged to the girl of my dreams. Although I moved, my drinking problem came with me. After 6 months, I lost my job working at a liquor store, and fell into a deep depression. My fiancee who's the kindest person I've ever met supported me fully through it all until after 7 months, from January-July, I had to snap out of it and went back to work in a sink-or-swim situation, as we were broke with only one income.   


I was now 25, right back to where I was before I first got here, but the alcohol use was getting worse and worse as the days went on. Each day, the underlying anxiety I've dealt with for years was getting worse and bleeding into my daily life, and subsequently so did the amount of alcohol I drank at night. It was a vicious cycle that consumed me for the next year and a half.  I lived my life, but it wasn't a fulfilling one. By this point, after my depressive episode I had put on a ton weight, I felt worthless working a retail job, and I had aged tremendously. Above all I knew I was letting my fiancee down.  


 This past August, I took a new job, hoping I could reshape the world around me, and prepare myself to be in a better place to quit drinking. I was looking at my problem backwards, thinking the problems around me were exacerbating my urge to drink, and not for what they were. My drinking was creating all of the problems around me. I was working as a ""Security Guard"", and basically living in the same shit, different day, different place, as I let my problem follow me. In December of 2019, I had a job interview that was going to be a promotion, and the nervousness and anxiety that built up as the interview came near made me drink more, which in turn, no matter how I tried to rationalize it, made me more anxious. I was such an anxious wreck, that I missed my job interview. I made the decision the night before when I was drinking, I knew if I drank too much I wouldn't be able to make it, and the alcohol comforted me.   


And that was it. One of the biggest wake up calls I needed to have. I realized my alcohol was costing me a career, my relationship was failing as I wasn't making my fiancee happy, my health was in a decline, I need I had to do something. And so I did.   


The next night, On December 5th, 2019, I didn't drink. I didn't sleep much that night, as I hadn't expected to. The struggle for me, the battle that I had built up in my head for years and years up until this point, wasn't what I imagined. The next day, I was tired, but I was determined. I went for a walk to take my mind off things and was immediately blown away at how much looser my body felt. My senses were coming back to me. My sense of smell was almost overwhelming. My anxiety wasn't as debilitating. I was seeing the benefits before my very eyes and it was exactly what I needed. Momentum to ride into sobriety.  


 So here I am nearly 3 months later. 3 sober months. I got a new job which pays more, I've lost 20 pounds, and I'm happier than I've ever been. I feel better than I have in years but...now I feel empty. That struggle that has dwelled within me for  years, the mountain I had to climb, my struggle to overcome the biggest thing holding me back was over, and now, despite everything else, I feel empty.  


I never went to anything like AA or any sort of support group, so I don't know how common this is. Last night was my Friday, and I felt like drinking, to do something different to break up the monotonous nature of my currently daily routine. I let the smell of alcohol linger in my nose, and I took the first sip, and I was absolutely disgusted. I was immediately brought back to all of my constant hangovers and daily anxiety. I knew I couldn't go back, not after coming this far. I poored it all out and didn't even think twice. However now, I just don't know whats left. Is this normal? Is this still part of my brain adjusting to the lack of alcohol? Does this feeling eventually pass or is this why my alcoholism all started in the first place?  


Anyways, if you made it this far, thanks for hearing out my boring life story. If I broke any rules, I'm sorry.",11

2020-02-28 20:33:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fb562d/discussion_of_this_naked_mind_and_similar_books/,"Discussion of ""This Naked Mind"" and similar books","I recently finished reading ""This Naked Mind"" by Annie Grace, on the recommendation of a handful of other folks, and I want to share my thoughts, hopefully hear what others thought, and maybe hear and talk about some similar books. (Sorry if this has been done to death on this sub - I know it's a frequently mentioned book. I've lurked for a while on my old account and haven't seen a thread specifically about this book.)

For those unfamiliar, This Naked Mind is a book about dealing with addiction to alcohol, by really drilling in an understanding of the harm of drinking, and getting you to really think about your reasons for drinking, and how they change over time. The book cites a lot of really good scientific sources to support its claims, and the author provides a narrative to tie it together.

Personally, I thought the book had a lot of good things to say, but also some potentially detrimental things, depending on the reader's perspective and experience. That's probably true of every book written on addiction, but I think it's definitely true of this one.

For me, the book's most salient point is that willpower is a finite (or at least slow to regenerate) resource. What that means for us is that every time we have to make the conscious decision not to drink, it wears our willpower down a little bit, and eventually our conscious minds just don't have the resources needed to resist the unconscious desire to drink, and we fail.

This Naked Mind says that our goal should be to intentionally re-mold our unconscious mind to *stop* desiring alcohol, by fully understanding that alcohol is never helpful, always harmful, and then make the choice, once and for all, to be free of drinking. That one decision would persist forever, and we would never have to consciously decide not to drink again. I think that's an interesting goal, and for me it was a new way of thinking about the problem.

The book has a lot of good points like that, that I hope to carry with me. HOWEVER, I think that, for some people, fully taking Annie Grace's word for everything could actually be very harmful. One statement that is reiterated throughout the book is that ""by the end of this book, you will be free from addiction,"" because you will fully understand alcohol, and will have made all the necessary changes to your unconscious thinking. As for that goal of choosing ""once and for all"" not to drink, I'm just pretty certain, from my experience as an addict who has seen some serious depths of despair, that that goal is not attainable. The book literally claims that ""you won't feel tempted to drink for the sake of drinking; in fact, at home, drinking won't even cross your mind.""

I don't know about you, and maybe my interpretation was more literal than the author intended, or maybe I'm just not a suggestible person, but that made me go ""holy shit this person thinks they're hypnotizing me via book."" After having read the book, I can tell you that the thought of drinking still crosses my mind.

I'll restate, I think it's a good book with a lot to teach. I just think that there might be some who read it literally and think ""I'm cured!"" at the end, and then wind up knocked out because they thought their fight was won. I believe we have to be much more vigilant than that (and I don't that's a controversial opinion, lol)

What do you guys think about this book?

Anyone care to share some other books that have been helpful in recovery?

I'm reading ""Behave"" by Robert Sapolsky, which is about human behavior. It's freakin' brilliant, and really funny. Not specifically about addiction, but I think understanding more about why we do what we do is helpful in recovery.

Thanks for reading my post. Hopefully it wasn't too presumptuous. I want to participate more in this sub, because I've recently redoubled my efforts in recovery and want to do everything I can to keep fighting and work with others in recovery.",17

I’m probably around a year and seven or eight months sober; I stopped counting a while ago.  It doesn’t feel like it matters anymore, in general because it has become such an automatic “I don’t drink”, but also because I feel so cripplingly depressed that I’m okay with throwing it away now.

Externally, and for a while internally, it looks like I’ve gotten my shit together.  I’ve been in therapy for over a year, I’ve lost 95lbs, I got a job, improved various things, etc.

Part of it is probably actually processing the grief and trauma that got me to the point of being a morbidly obese alcoholic, and in part because... well I don’t know, but I’ve lost any sense of progress.  I’ve been self sabotaging and making myself feel like shit by binge eating, I took a few days off work so I wouldn’t go jump off a bridge, hell I plan to quit my job because I can’t handle it anymore.  I honestly don’t care if I can’t afford living at all.

I can see I’m back in the ‘non-existent’ zone of depression that I lived in for years.  I don’t think the few people I’ve mentioned these feelings to take me seriously, parent/therapist.  I have a disability that affects every aspect of life but I’m not disabled ‘enough’ to qualify for any programs or aid.  I feel so hopeless and alone and fucking terrible typing that.

I’ve tried anti depressants, anti anxiety, talked to doctors, got sober, quit nicotine, therapy, calling the suicide hotline, every basic ass coping mechanism out there, and... I’m back to base camp.

So, today I walked into the liquor store and bought my old reliable.  I know that if I take a sip from this bottle, I’ll drink myself to my grave.  Given I evidently haven’t gotten ‘over’ my eating issues of coping, I probably haven’t gotten ‘over’ my drinking issues either.  

Again, I doubt this is the right sub but I need help.  I’ll take any and all advice if there’s any to give.  Thanks for reading and sorry if I wasted your time.",6

Needless to say, this forum was of great help (thank you to all of you).  I was pretty much a functional alcoholic, like my father was. Had good jobs, a good relationship with people in general, a good relationship with my partner. But the eternal chase of another glass of wine was eating me alive. Every morning the dread, the anxiety, the promise of not drinking again that day. And the same cycle again at night. The funny part is how I quit drinking: one day that my mom was measuring my grandma's blood pressure,  she measured mine too, for fun, and it was high. The day after that, it was high again, and I got so scared that I quit drinking that day.  I went to the dr the next day and my blood pressure was fine, the next one: fine. The day after that day, I was fine. The dr said that could be stress (I was taking care of an aunt that was very sick those 2 days), but he was very surprised when he asked me how much I drank, and I answered with the truth. I wasn't surprised by his face, I knew that I had a problem already. My life revolved  around drinks, when I was younger I was a party monster, but then, older, I just drank after work, everyday. So when the blood pressure issue happened, and I quit drinking cold turkey, I wasn't even thinking of rehab, but it felt so right, I felt so good, that I kept going. To go to sleep was like a candy for me, it was AMAZING, and I felt so thankful. Everything was reatively easy (I was always reading literature and forums about rehab from alcohol, Medium was like a friend for me), another good thing is that I left the city and went to live to a far little town in an unknown beach (I'm from Costa Rica), so I'm quite far from temptations. I 've gone to a handful of parties in the city, all good, had lots of fun, everything is like a discovery, which I love.  My dad quit drinking too, and my mom too :) since they listened to my discoveries of sobriety that I told with such happiness and amusement. I quit smoking as well, and that was HARD, and it's still hard, since I smoke sometimes. It's not the first time that I attemped to quit smoking. And I told you all this story just to get to this point. Now I think I have cravings for alcohol, but I think they are cravings for tobacco, but I can't tell! since I'm off of both! Does this happen or happened to anyone else? It's hard to tell. Anyways, I'm writing this because today is a hard day, because I feel like I should be doing something to break this anxiety (I know I should be doing yoga! ugh, but well.. I don't know why is being hard to start practicing again, It's been 3 months since the last time). Sometimes I think that I should be smoking and not being so hard on myself, but again.. I don't know if it's my mind playing tricks. If you read until this point, thank you.  (Sorry for any grammar problems, english is not my native language). You are all amazing, I enjoy reading almost everything you post, it's a great community.",7

It’s been a rough road. I’d quit for like 7 days at a time then binge of plain vodka shots and beers. 7 days was longest I made it until now. 

What I changed this time around is a complete diet redo, added the gym, and do Uber Eats to keep me busy during the time I’d typically drink. 

Diet: Ketogenic. I only eat 20 carbs per day max, that is usually from blackberries, some sweeter root veggies. Rest of my diet is meat, cheese, bacon, eggs, butter.  For me this killed my cravings completely and has even made beer taste bad.  Went from wanting more and more alcohol to barely wanting it at all, even with a sip.  I tried some vodka since it’s zero carbs also, just not the same. I can’t finish it. 

Gym: work out during times I’d typically drink. Cardio for 30 minutes and lifting for 30 minutes. 

Uber/ Uber Eats:  keeps me busy also during those times plus makes some sort of money.  

My mentality has completely changed. I don’t have mid day energy drops, no heartburn, no brain fog. Just level energy all day. Can fall asleep within 10 minutes of laying down, consistent time. I’m not moody anymore. 

I can’t see myself going back, brand new me in almost just 2 weeks. Hopefully I can keep it up.",28

After a few years of that, I did start to get bored with drinking and tried to take myself down to 6% and I left it at that for 5 years.

I have drank since 6th grade, sneaking Sloe Gin from my parents liquor cabinet.  It always starts with ""just one"" that leads to waking up at midnight to take another shot, eat more chips and pass back out.

I've been trying for a long time but my big problem was, and still is sleep.

I guess I have become so accustomed to drinking to sleep its now a habit.  I know its been 3 nights and I am waiting for sleep to come better.  I fall asleep poorly, wake up multiple times and even on a day off I am up early.

So, I didn't tell my family.  I don't want to say I am giving it up for Lent and then disappoint them.  I haven't told my wife and she wants to go to a local bar for happy hour.  I always drink there.  What should I say to her if she asks why I'm not drinking.

I can't believe she hasn't noticed (I drank a lot).  She may have noticed and not said anything but why the bar?  I am not worried about being tempted.  I am more of the ""I don't have to start, but if I start I can't stop"" type.

To say I understood you is not true, I was blind

Your influence, your pull, you push was overwhelming

For the first time in my life I no longer need you and your swelling

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say goodbye


Eating, controlling, suffocating, destroying, devouring all that my life was

You've made me lose the most important thing in life, love and time

Lost with you but not lost without, my vision was nothing but fuzz

It's time to give you up, it's over, this life is mine

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say goodbye


My disgust, anger and rage, sadness should all be directed at you

You never helped raise me up, gave me courage, it was all just a fluke

Fucked my life, my family, my mind, my memory

I couldn't be more determined to forget you and remember me

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say goodbye


To meet myself again was and is truly terrifying 

I'm timid, loveable, goofy, easy to upset, slowly building what used to be 

A better me, a new me, a new vision in scrying

Trying to love myself, help myself, treat myself and fix myself for me

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say hello


To embrace, to laugh, to love, to cry, to feel is so powerful now

Been stuck in time since you made your way into my life

I forgot what it was like to feel, to be amazed to really say wow

This path down this road will not be easy and full of strife, but

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say hello


To love, something and someone I lost long ago

I couldn't be more sad about this, it really destroyed my ego

I have to fix what I've lost, to embrace my everlasting light, she's still here at the moment so I'm hoping all will be fine

The rocky road we've been through will hopefully be just a tough but important memory with our love standing at the end of the line, waiting patiently with a warm hug and a big smile, something that's truly divine

It feels good for the first time in a long time to say hello


Goodbye to an old enemy, not a friend. Your bullshit has no grip over me, not this time.


Hello to a friend and not an enemy. Your light and love will show me what this life was supposed to be, it's time to take back what is mine",6

A crappy plot summary, moderate SPOILERS until the rest of the post as well :  
PLOT  
>!
There's a village built around a big hole, the Abyss. The Abyss is worlds deep, like a fantasy dungeon with many floors going down. It is mostly unexplored, especially the deeper levels, yet it attracts adventurers from all over, seeking treasure, power or glory. If you try to go back up too fast (pulled up by a rope), you get something equivalent to divers decompression sickness from trying to come up too fast. 

So our two protagonists are hopping down to find answers, because one's mom is has disappeared deep down there and the other doesn't know where he came from, but probably down there. It starts out innocently enough, all about adventure, curiosity and meeting interesting people. They go deeper it gets weird and kind of not fun. Going deeper, things go from kind of fucked up to truly fucked up. Close to the end is a graveyard of shells of souls, who cannot remember anything but their core desires.!<  
ENDPLOT

Every alcoholic started out but a simple adventurer, looking for little nuggets of gold in life. You wanted to not be held behind by your shyness. You wanted to be fun. Alcohol gave you all that and much more. It showed the world outgoing you. Real you. Funny you. Loving you. Stupid you. Relaxed you. Sleepy you. Sad you. Angry you. Rageful you. Spiteful you. New friends just like you. The first levels are the best. But you're always forced to go down the abyss, because the tolerance builds up. A couple of sips doesn't make you relaxed, numb or fun anymore, it just makes you feel like you've been teased. Going back up just seems like returning to a dull life. You keep drinking just hoping that there are more treasures to be found down there.

At the mid levels, alcohol has a grip on you. Soft at first, then worse as you go down. Weird stuff starts happening, most of it ""out of your control"", but really, you chose to walk into these situation, seeking the treasures. Sometimes the situations are just weird, sometime scary, sometimes dangerous. The treasures and successes are smaller, rarer and require so much more sacrifice to achieve. Yet you keep going down looking for more, it hurts too much to go back up.

Alcohol has now shown its true face, that of many cunning creatures, who will use their knowledge of your motivations and actions to get you walk straight into their mouths. Whatever alcohol shows you now, is nothing close to anything like the real yous that you were seeking at the begining. You only get to see illusions now, causing you to despise people you once cared for, tear your own limbs(organs) appart, curse every gift you've ever received, every effort you've ever achieved and self-sabotage your own life. Through much drama and suffering, you've accepted alcohol as a part of your identity now, for it was the only one beside you through all of this madness. And so you go deeper, following it where it leads you.

The fifth level, level of asinine. Everything is for the greater good, but everything is wrong and cruel. You're now a destructive alcoholic. You keep drinking, always under the illusions that its the best answer to your situation, thinking that it can at least numb you into productivity if it can't put you in a good mood. You keep slashing the core fabric of your life appart, thinking that every cut is just a random mistake. Until there is nothing left.

On the [sixth floor](https://reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism), all that remains in your life is the deepest desires for the things you lost, sometimes spite for the entities that got you into drinking in the first place or encouraged it's ongoing usage. Alcohol doesn't care about you anymore, it took everything there was to take already. And you just keep drinking because the pain of coming up is too heavy. 

The story doesn't cover the last floor yet. I don't know how it will fit into my interpretations when it does come out. 

However, the last floor for me, was delirium tremens. When you're at rock bottom, having lost everything, you either choose to go up, or you run out of money/alcohol eventually. DT is the final boss. You DON'T want to have to fight him more than once. This is alcohols raging reaction seeing you escape from its clutches of an abusive relationship.

The visible symptoms are the least worrisome; the shakes, the sweating, the restlessness, the insomnia. Slightly more worrisome is everything you can physically feel inside. The nausea, the heart palpitations, the rising blood pressure, your nervous system going haywire. 

Then, the final weapons. The first of two that I have been presented with, was [The Fear](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=The%20Fear). The sense of doom in the universe, worthlessness of everything you. It confounds you into committing suicide, making it seem like its the obvious choice at this point in life, or at least that's what it did for me. I don't know how I got past this round. I was truly ready to hang myself and end my shitty burden of an existence. Alcohol's way of saying ""You're a piece of shit that doesn't deserve to live, you're lucky that I've considered accepting you in my embrace.""

Some hours later, the final weapon gets drawn out. The paranoia, psychosis, anxiety, delusions, hallucinations. You are led to truly believe. Believe that everyone you've ever cared about hates you. Believe that you were never really loved. Believe that they've all joined the ranks of your enemies. Believe that they've plotted and schemed to trick and hurt you for their own sick pleasure. And so your anxiety rises as does your heart rate. You must wallow in this pain for many hours. Some people never make it through. The heart race increase due to the anxiety compounds initial the palpitations going beyond what your body can handle. And just like that, you die, alcohol having squeezed your heart out of its last heartbeat. And that's the last memory you'll have leaving this world. The abusive lover, seeing you leave, knocking you to the ground, choking you to death while cursing you with obscenities. This is what lied at the bottom of my Abyss of alcohol.

I almost would rather have something that gives me a label at least for problem solving purposes. So I have drank since I was 18..I'm 34 now. Early on it was binge drinking with some nights getting so hammered I puked on myself, peed the bed, or otherwise made an ass out of myself. I quit drinking vodka in my early 20s because I was a mean ass drunk on that. I have continued to drink beer/wine and I have very rarely gotten hammered like I used to, but it's still ""over"" what I should. I can easily down a bottle of wine and feel fantastic. I love a good buzz and hate the feeling of being too drunk.

I drink 3 nights per week usually with maybe 2-6 glasses of wine in those times.

I have never had legal, job, or other issues r/t drinking. I have gotten lucky with driving. I stopped vodka when it was causing relational issues. But I still feel like it contributes to some depression, weight issues, and energy (lack thereof) that I have. 

I like the thought of sobriety but I would miss the nights with friends and wine w/dinner. I have never had any rock bottom and I think that's why I don't ever commit to quitting alcohol. I definitely would never have ""just one glass"" though and would rather just forgo alcohol if I'm not going to get a buzz. My tolerance is pretty high too nowadays. So where do I fall?

I never thought of myself of having a problem. I can get up, go to work, live life without having a drink. But at night? One or two drinks to calm down after the day. Which leads to a couple more plus a beer. And by then, everything is a good idea. Only to wake up the next day with a pounding headache, nauseous...hungover. 

My wife and I are on day four of not drinking. **Nothing!** I'm feeling great! She's feeling great! 

But....its the weekend. I struggle with the weekends, I know *everyone* struggles with the weekends.  To give myself a little extra incentive to enjoy a frosty cold sparkling water rather than a beer, I went through my bank and credit card statements adding up how much we've spent at liquor stores (ONLY liquor stores, because god only knows where/when/how much was spent at bars or dinner or beer at the grocery store) since January 1, 2019. In the past 422 days, we have spent $7,705.39 on liquor. 

We could have paid off a credit card balance three times over with that money. We could have planned a trip to Italy and Greece this year. We could have done so much more. But we chose to drink ourselves stupid and wake up feeling like shit only to follow the same path that night.

I think about drinking everyday, but I’ve been able to push through. Though it hasn’t been all roses, things are generally looking up. I’m healthier than I have been in a long time, I’m actually cultivating hobbies, I’m more present, and I’m getting small doses of hope every once in a while. 

Anyway, I suppose I’m posting for a little encouragement because I’m about to embark on a very difficult three-day-long trip. I’m flying out, alone, to Washington for a friend’s wedding. So I have to be sober in the airport (a first since I was a kid), stay sober all alone in an unfamiliar city, and then attend the wedding of a friend who has no idea I’m sober (again, all by myself). It should also be mentioned that this friend and I used to do quite a bit of drinking together in college.

Since then it hasn't really been on my mind, besides the occasional 28th passing by and me thinking about how many months it had been. Now here I am. And although most days I don't consciously think about alcohol, the one year mark is something I'm proud of.

I have 12+ years of sobriety, and this study really got me to thinking about the ""chain of events"" in my own life that contributed to my own drinking patterns and eventual alcoholism. 

Honestly, my self-image was in the garbage when I was young. Concern over my weight (**and bullying**) contributed to an eating disorder. Even as I started college, my fear of the ""freshman 15"" influenced what I chose to drink — eventually, that was hard liquor (vodka, gin, etc). 

Looking back, I'm just thinking about how those choices and experiences also **physiologically** contributed to my alcoholism. 

**Does anyone else here relate??** 

[Here's the link to the study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200225154338.htm). 

From the link: 

**Weight-based bullying linked to increased adolescent alcohol, marijuana use**

>Previous research has found that boys have greater substance use in their teens and early adulthood, but girls begin using alcohol and drugs at an earlier age compared with boys. Those trends may be related to the societal pressures for girls to adhere to unrealistic body image ideals. This can damage their sense of self-worth and contribute to eating disorders and self-medication through substance use to cope with teasing or fit in with their peers, Klinck said.

...

>""The old saying that 'sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me' is a fallacy that ignores the serious effects of emotional abuse and verbal bullying,"" Klinck said. ""Weight-based discrimination appears to be one of the most common and seemingly socially sanctioned reasons to bully or discriminate against someone. As a society, we need to address the damage caused by this, especially for girls.""",5

Anyway, I got her out of my life and am now over a month sober.

It’s been lonely and weird but also feels great as I am experiencing the normal stuff like weight loss, mornings, sleep etc. 

Now it’s time for me to start dating again. I have spent the last month in total isolation and am realizing that for the first time in my life, I’m feeling dreading the awkwardness of dating. My whole life it was never an issue because I was drunk. I went on a first date last week and it was not bad but not really good either. I was awkward and not as funny and charming. The night ended with me just wanting to go home and be alone so I did. In my past life it would have ended with an awkward morning. 

I’m meeting a woman next week for another first date and once again am filled with a weird sort of dread. What if she asks me back to her place? How do you even do that sober?!

earlier this week i called to set up a doctors appointment for a shot of vivotrol at some point soon in the future.  as well, i had some librium (about two days worth i bet) somewhere in my mess of the apartment.  so i decided i was gonna do a taper this weekend and use the librium as back up. i even called a friend to let me stay in her guest bedroom while this shit hits the fan this weekend.  the plan was to wake up, go to class, drop off the rent money, drop off the rent check, go to the doctor today to talk about an early next week shot of vivotrol, pack my overnight  bag for two days as well as some rice, and then walk to my friends house stopping for as much gatorade as i had room left in my bag.  i was also gonna bring about twelve beers or so to contine my taper.

 well, my last taper failed and today i have no faith in it. the morning has just begun and as i said, i have already puked and am a shaky mess. there is no fucking way class is happening. the docs appointments at 230, luckily just down the street from me, so im lucky there. my plan is to sit here in shakes and chills til about one o clock or one thirty, shower for the first time since i can remember, and slowly crawl my way to his office.

From that point i can see a few different options happening, so lets run those down. option 1. say fuck it and walk to the liquor store right now and just shut my phone off for the day. option 2. get up right now and drop off the money, go to class a mess, get back with just enough time to make my appt and spend the night at friends. option 3 sit here shivering and puking til 2, try and shower, and go to appt then friends and figure money out tomorrow. option 5 is go to appt, and then as i assume he will reccomend straight to the ER or third floor detox  to spend a nice weekend/week depending on where he sends me.  either way im packing an overnight bag in an hour or so i guess.  

&#x200B;

fucking withdrawal folks. this is hell. literal everyday, waking hell. ive just grown used to the pain i feel in my side, the nausea and puking that will happen every morning till i pour that first drink, the late night calls to family members or friends that end in me just yelling incoherently about nothing and insulting them.  I used to drink to have fun. then it started to be able to help numb my depression and still be fun as i got older. then i just started drinking to numb my depression and dealt with what ever side effects came along. now im numb to even drinking. there isnt a joy anymore, my depression comes from my drinking, and any physical sensation now is more closely related to vomiting then feeling a sensation of relief.  

&#x200B;

Look im rambling. the mods were kind to me last night and decided not to ban me even after i tried to take a giant shit on them.  thank you and a tip of the hat.  idk how today is gonna go. youll prolly get a pic of me in the ER hooked up to every machine ever in about 5 hours like so many times in the past, or a long rambling post drugged up on librium from my friends guest bedroom tonight. both are equally possible and have happened many times.  someone in one of my comments asked personally for a check in, so here it is.  one long ramble of incoherent, withdrawal ridden, nothing to sayings from someone who is in trouble, but doing the best he can to make it to monday.

It is my old 'drinking friends'  big 'once a year' drunken mess.  I'm 42, and this is basically a vestige of our early 30s, when we were consciously drinking like we were still in our early 20s.  Not much has changed for them, but because of our age and kids etc. no one really sees each other like they used to.  They still see each other more than they see me, but not as much as they once did.

This one is hard because it's such a throw back.  I feel bad, I'll get some light pressure, but I also hate it because of the reminder of what I once was.  I wish that I had more in common with them than being drunk.  I wish that I could have been more to them than 'a guy who was also drunk'.  I wish that I could have stayed in touch more, even if it wasn't my fault.  I wish that I wasn't nervous on a Friday for what should be fun on a Saturday.  

There's not much of a point to my post, I guess, other than to say that at 4 years in I'm not really nervous that I'll drink, but that still it's not entirely something I'll ever be 'over'.  That's OK too.  IWNDWYT.",8

Also i was wondering if anyone else feels like they are faking being an alcoholic. Thoughts like, ah, i´m not that bad, there are people worse off than me, why am i trying to be something i´m not. I don´t have shakes when i don´t have a drink, i can function if i do. But then again, people who drink normally, don´t really constantly fuck their life up because of it.

Is it just me, trying to convince myself that it´s ok to have a drink or is it simple denial?

I knew fairly early on I had a problem. But rarely did it affect my day-to-day work life in any significant way. I was successful, I had a beautiful wife and children. But deep down inside I knew it was controlling me, and I was not controlling it.

I never drank during the day, nor did I have any real desire, but I couldn't wait to get home and have that first cocktail. And over the years that first cocktail got earlier and earlier. It also got stronger and stronger.....

Countless times I said to myself I know I have a problem, and countless times I would cut back, thinking that if i did that i would be in control. So many times I fooled myself because I was able to gain control (in my own mind) temporarily. All I wanted to be was a casual drinker. But once again deep down inside I knew I was not in control and I was definitely not a casual drinker. 

I remember many times talking to my physician at my annual checkup that I thought I had a problem, and he basically said he didn't think so. I don't know for sure but he probably had a drinking problem of his own.

In my midlife I bought a vacation home. I pretty much convinced myself that on the weekends I would only drink there. And for the most part that was true. Except I found those weekends getting longer and longer, meaning that instead of going up on a Friday night and coming home on a Sunday I would be going up on a Wednesday night and coming home on the following Sunday or Monday. This was all in the name of “cutting back”. What made the weekend drinking worse was that I wasn't actually drinking any less overall, I was drinking seven days worth of alcohol in two or three nights. I think AA calls it ""catching up"". 

For most of my life I was never an angry drunk, never got in trouble, never got a DUI, never missed a day of work. But once I got into the mode of “catching up”, I became more angry, aggressive and argumentative with my family and friends. After one of those incidents, I woke up in the morning deeply saddened. I asked my wife to drive me to an AA meeting and that was the beginning of me quitting. I finally realized that cutting back was not going to work for me, only outright quitting would work. Cutting back always gave me an excuse to slide back into drinking. But if I quit, I had no more excuses. For me, it worked..

I was 100% sober for about 26 months. That ended four months ago when I started drinking again, at least somewhat casually. Not heavy (but heavy enough), and nearly every day and that's what scared me. I began to look forward to it again, and the cravings were back by early evening. Until two days ago when I quit again.....

I could look upon that as a failure, but in reality its a verification. A verification that I can quit, and a verification that I do not need or want to drink. Im not happy about it, but I’m happy i quit again.",16

I only drink once or twice a week, but my brain would like to drink more.  I have a very addictive personality. I quit smoking 3 months ago after 15 years. So yay me, but with drinking I just really have no off switch. I say I'll have one drink then it turns into seven. 
I generally just drink at home with my partner one night of the weekend and maybe one day during the work week (not as common).  I always wake up hungover. Even if I only have a couple drinks (the older I get the worse the hangovers and they just aren't worth it).  If I drink in public I control myself because I don't want to make an ass of myself.   I guess this is just an internal struggle of mine. How can I control my dumb drunk brain?  My partner isn't much of drinker. And will just drink with me, but if he is tired or full he just stops. He is the opposite of an addictive personality and doesn't understand how I don't just stop drinking when I feel drunk or tired etc.   The only thing that I do is only bring a certain amount of alcohol into the house. I never have extra in the house because I would just drink it within a day or two.

received a call from my friend at about 7am this morning. She’s been my hardcore drinking buddy for the last few years, plus my daughter hangs out with her kids, my husband and hers are best friends, so our families are together quite a bit. She was obviously intoxicated and told me she was “finishing her drink” from last night, which means she’s going to keep going. Over the past month she’s made many comments about when I was going to start drinking again, etc. This morning’s conversation left me in tears though – she told me I wasn’t fun anymore, I was boring, and so on for about 20 minutes. She said me not drinking was affecting her and she was tired of my shit, blah blah blah. She was laughing throughout everything she was saying, but I know she meant every word. She even told me she would spike my water when I wasn’t looking to get me to drink again. I’m clinging to my 32 days as it is – this shit isn’t easy. Everyone is drinking around me, temptations are everywhere, and EVERYTHING she said are my exact fears. I’m not fun, I’m boring – who would want to hang around me sober?! I’ve already been feeling a bit of stress because my husband is still drinking, going out with our friends, etc. I’d NEVER ask him to change what he’s doing, that wouldn’t be fair, but come on now. For the first time in my 32 days I really feel…. Hopeless. I feel like saying fuck it, what’s the point? I’m normally a pretty positive, bubbly person but I feel as if someone is sitting on my chest right now. No one would understand what I’m going through except you guys.

Honestly, when I first stopped drinking, it was easy for me. Sometimes I felt guilty browsing this sub because of how little I struggled.  I never liked social drinking or day drinking and I never needed alcohol to have fun or make friends, so the transition didn't seem too huge.

Even in college, I never drank *often,* but when I did drink, I guzzled until I blacked out. Until I was blacking out every Friday night, picking up the pieces the rest of the weekend. My signature move during blackouts would be to make out with people, hook up with strangers, and proposition my friends (often with disastrous consequences). Now a few years out of college, I drink less and less often, but on the few occasions I did go ""out"" drinking, I would almost always black out. Make out with people, hook up with strangers, proposition my friends. The same old destructive, drunk behavior.

It happened less and less and less, but it was still happening; so, after a friendship-ending, blacked out hookup three months ago, I had had enough. I quit cold turkey, and, like I mentioned, it wasn't that hard for me. Through these past months, I've had amazing nights out with friends, birthday parties where I took shots of ginger ale, wine nights sipping on grape juice, and clubbing totally sober. Not once during all of those times did I really crave a drink.

Tonight, I'm going on a date with someone I just met two days ago - and all I want is a drink. All I want to do is cover up the nervousness and anxiety and worries that it'll go poorly with a nice buzz. I want it with an intensity that never occurred during the period of physical withdrawal, with a need that frightens me. Every protective part of my psyche is screaming at me to drink, that drinking is the only way for this to go well, that I cannot be charming or fun or work up the courage to kiss someone unless I've ingested some toxins into my body. It's so sharp and so immediate that it frightens me.

I know exactly what will happen if I cave and get a drink tonight. The atmosphere will become soft and warm, and magic will seemingly start to flow into my conversation, my actions. The person across from me will become funnier, more attractive, the lights outside a movie scene instead of commonplace city lights. I'll have a second drink, then a third, because deep down I know the whole time I am building up enough of a comfortable barrier between me and my panic. Eventually it'll snowball into a black out, and I won't remember going home with that person - I'll wake up in a strangers bed feeling sick in body and spirit. 

Alcohol provides a shortcut past the pain and hunger that lies beneath the surface of our selves - whatever blockers we have that prevent us from allowing ourselves to be loved can be temporarily dissolved with a good buzz. However, they're always still there on the other side of the binge - waiting and unchanged.

I'm now realizing that it's not about the alcohol. It's about the way I avoided building the real skills of love, intimacy, and sex because alcohol provided such nice, easy shortcuts for all of those things. It's about those deep, broken, cracked parts of myself that I have failed to love and nurture for YEARS because the alcohol made them easy to hide.  Now that the alcohol's gone, they can't hide anymore, and god DAMN they hurt. 

Tonight I'm going to meet my date in the fanciest bar in town, and I've already decided which mocktail I'm going to order. After tonight, however, I know I will have to sink my hands deep into the mucky, earthy, hard work of untangling the fear and shame circling around this, that I have covered up and ignored for too long.

Started with 3 beers every evening and ended up with a bottle whiskey every evening. Alcohol doesn't make me happy anymore and on the hungover days i'm having the worst depressions wanting me to drink again, even though i know i'm making everything worse.  


I'm on my second day sober today, no heavy withdrawals just constantly thinking about getting high or drunk again, heck i even dreamed about having a beer last night (pretty much the same cravings when i unsuccessfully tried to quit smoking).  


What really scares me is the thought of never being able to go back to the old party on the weekends stay sober during the week lifestyle. This isn't even purely for alcohol but for anything else too. My moral is just to weak to keep me from relapsing into the old patterns. I don't have any plans on how long i should stay of the booze, all i know is i can't continue like this. Hopefully the next few days will be clearer. I'll visit a doctor next week and check the damage i've done, this should also help me making my mind up.",2

It came to a head after a bender in which an entire week's worth of work was missed. Says something about my employer I even have a job at all.

Sat down with a company therapist last Monday. An hour and a half session in an overly hot room, every question imaginable was asked about all aspects of my drinking. Finally a plan was drawn up that I was compelled to sign. It includes 8 AA meetings a month, 4 counseling sessions, a possible visit to a GP to obtain naltrexone, and being subject to random drug testing. The whole thing will last three months, with a light schedule of counseling for the fourth month. It started yesterday with a drug screen, ""reasonable suspicion"" level- in which a breathalyzer was administered, and I was made to show under my pant legs and around my waist before submitting a sample. Felt vaguely like a criminal- somehow during my drinking career spanning decades had never blown into a breathalyzer. 

I'm alternating between fear and uncertainty and a realization that this is RIGHT, not a punishment but rather a necessity. That if I don't stop I'll lose everything, if I'm not pushing up daisies first. That's the type of drinker I am. The type that sleeps fitfully only to wake up long enough to chug down hard liquor. The type that doesn't stop until every last drop is finished- then suffers for days after. 

The journey is about to start. The bumpy road awaits. When I consider it though it's the right fork in the path to take. Sure it might be a bit rough and inconvenient. But if I don't get off the path I'm on- well this one only leads to ruin.

I'll see you on the trail... and I won't drink with you today.",8

Without insurance/my meds, I started using vodka to help me sleep (up to 750/mL to day). I got sober in March 2018, for about a month (1 week of withdrawals). During this time, I used a friend’s ambien to help me sleep or was staying in countries where you can get drugs similar to Xanax, over the counter.

When I felt “in control” again in April 2018, I mostly casually drank until Feb 2019. This was when I went home and things got bad, real fast. AA horror story level. I actually fled the USA again, bc I was worried about legal action. 

Resorted back to using vodka to sleep until Aug 2019, when I got an expat job and finally had insurance, again. That time, a friend stayed with me to get me through outpatient detox.

Again, stayed sober for a month or 2... 

Back to 1-5 drinks/ day, and starting to get mild withdrawal symptoms when I haven’t drank that day.

I don’t want to hit rock bottom again, but I feel like any kind of rehab (inpatient), might get me sober for a bit, but I’ll eventually fall back into drinking, due to my history and the lack of anxiety I feel when I’m drunk.

I just don’t know what I’m supposed to do, as I am very impulsive and always, eventually just give my body what it wants. As I have previously hit literal rock bottom (camping out on a river to hide from family/police), and failed to maintain sobriety... I really can’t justify that a rehab would actually help me.

It happens and i wake up the next day shocked because it wasn’t even part of the agenda for that day. A switch goes off inside of me and I mindlessly pick up the bottle and I don’t stop. I won’t stop until it’s gone. 

I say shitty things.
I hurt the ones I love.
And the cycle repeats.

Yet, I never learn. 

I’m tired of being anxious and depressed trying to remember what I may have said or did and I’m tired of watching the look of shame and disappointment from the ones that love me most.

I hit rock bottom on Monday evening, which resulted in going to the ER. 

I went to a mental health hospital on Tuesday afternoon to be evaluated. They recommended that I be admitted for 5-7 days to detox... at a pretty steep price. My wife and I talked about it and decided it was probably for the best anyway. 

So, I came home and packed up a bag with clothes and the miniscule amount of things that they allow you to bring with you. I got there at 530pm, by 9pm I still had only had my vitals taken. So my wife called me and said that she had done some more reading and thought it would probably be safe for me to just spend the night at home as long as we monitored my blood pressure closely. I also called my dad (who is a physician) and talked to him about it, and he said that it was probably medically alright to do that, especially since the hospital told me that it was going to be at least another hour before I could be admitted and I was already running on only about two hours of sleep.

The hospital allows a check in within 24 hours of your evaluation being completed, so the plan was to see how I was feeling the next morning, and if I experienced more severe symptoms of withdrawal, then I'd go check in. By noon, my blood pressure was going down (as I had upped my small dosage of it on my dad's recommendation), I wasn't nauseated at all, and the only true symptoms of withdrawal I was experiencing was night sweats and poor sleep.

Long story short, I didn't end up checking in, and by today I'm feeling significantly better. As of right now, I'm 88 hours sober, haven't had any cravings for alcohol, and am largely non-symtomatic of any detox issues. I know that this journey is still going to be difficult, and that I'm not completely out of the woods in detoxing, but I'm feeling much better today. 

I have an appointment with my primary care physician to discuss my blood pressure and probably up my dosage of the meds he has me on. My physician actually knows my dad professionally, so that's convenient. I also have an appointment with a new psychiatrist who specializes in addiction as well as bipolar disorder. Both of them are scheduled for next week. Then I'll take whatever my psychiatrist's recommendation for further treatment is and go from there.

This week was one of the scariest of my life. Thank you all for your kind words in my last post, and I look forward to being part of this community.",70

I've ""tried"" to get sober since Feb 2017, but honestly I've never done the work, never really had my heart in this. I knew I needed to stop, but also could always talk myself into a drink. 

I know this sounds so cliche, but - this time feels different. From the second I made the decision Tuesday that I was going to quit, I haven't had a single craving. My heart feels full, and I feel like my vision for my future is so clear, and it doesn't include alcohol. I have *never* felt this way about getting sober. 

I went to one AA meeting last year and the friend I went with bought me a Big Book. I never even cracked it open. I've been reading it constantly this week and I'm inspired. I'm going to a meeting today & I'm excited. (The last meeting I went to I was terrified, anxious and dreading it). As stupid as it might sound to some, it's like I have had an awakening & I really feel that higher power that AA describes. (If you're not into AA, that's totally ok, I know it isn't for everyone). 

I don't want to count my chickens before they hatch and I know I'll only know if this is it if I keep stringing my days together. But the optimism is overwhelming. I wish I could fast forward a year and see how I'm doing.

I was uncomfortable and itching for a drink around 3-7. And I drove myself to work so it would not have been difficult to stop for wine otw home.  I took my prescription that I can't drink on midday to solidify not getting a few secret drinks (of course by the end of things it was not really a secret most nights... crossing into ""suspicion"", but I was reeeaaallly good at pitching evidence, etc).  Left work right before daycare pickup so as not to put extra time when I could easily hit a gas station.  Got one of those Neuro Bliss soft drinks to replace the guzzling.  

At home lit candles and wax, kept busy.  Then something amazing happened.  My sober best friend texted me all night while I laughed with my family and did some craft projects and cleaned my jewelry.  He was up preparing for our weekly hang out game day in his pad across town.  I stayed up till midnight chatting with my friend and drinking tea and watching Letterkenny.  Too late for every night, but wow it felt good.  Is this what it feels like to *really* relax and enjoy the evening?  I was so uncomfortable when I was pregnant and so sleep deprived when I had an infant that I honestly don't know.  It's been years apparently since I *voluntarily* had sober evenings.

Cuz if I was drinking I would probably think for 20 mins about starting a project, then just pass out after kiddo bedtime and sloppy dinner.  Maybe there's food on my nightshirt when I wake up.  Face maybe didn't get washed properly.  Dishes not done.  Did I leave the oven on?  Did I lock everything up?  Did the dog get properly taken care of?  (Of course, cuz my husband made sure each time :/ )So many questions I don't have to answer.  So much dread I don't have to feel before even opening my eyes.

I don’t know the exact date of my last drink because I was probably doubtful that the date would really mark the beginning of an extended period of sobriety, so I didn’t commit it to memory.  This time around, however, at age 43, something is different and I’ve stayed sober longer than I have in at least a decade.  I wanted to share some of the things I’ve done.

I’ve come to realize that I was drinking to relieve boredom.  I thought I had nothing to do in the evenings after my kids fell asleep, so I’d start drinking. When I did, I couldn’t stop. The mornings were painful, work was a grind, I was embarrassed all the time, and yet I’d get home and start the process all over again several times a week.

I figured I’d help my chance of success if I had something to do, to keep me from feeling bored, so I started rewatching the tv series Lost. That kept my mind from thinking about wine, my drink of choice.  A couple of episodes in, my wife joined me.  As happens when one has a deep relationship with alcohol, my relationship with my wife had suffered, but here we were enjoying something together again.  We continued watching almost every night and are now nearing the end of the series. It’s been fun and given me something to look forward to in the evenings other than alcohol.

I also began practicing my guitar.  I’ve been a beginner for about 20 years, but something about sobriety has actually allowed me to progress beyond that in the last 5 months.  I have my guitar out and ready to play and I pick it up frequently. Again, this is something to keep my hands and mind occupied. It’s fun and rewarding, and it’s not alcohol.

Finally, I’ve always worked out regularly, but being healthy and sober makes it easier to go out on long jogs and get in more workouts here and there.  I’m now registered to run a marathon in November.  More importantly, I believe in myself, that I will train and be ready at the starting line.  That will be just after what I know to be a year of sobriety, if I continue avoiding that first drink.

So, to summarize, I’ve successfully avoided drinking by providing myself with plenty of other fun things to do. In the process, I’ve realized my life isn’t boring at all.  I will not drink with you today — I’ve got a date with my wife to watch Lost and I’m teaching myself the songs from Andy Shauf’s latest record.",11

In fact I’ve heard plenty of people share in meetings that they were in the program for months, even years, before finally getting a sobriety date, so I hope there are people here who can share about it too bc I need all the help I can get right now. 

So what was it? What clicked for you? How can I take what you learned and apply it to myself?",5

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

Hello, hello SD. It's Friday, so we know what means! It means I will be partaking in either the gym or a long walk after work, making a healthy dinner for myself, and be in bed by 8PM. [PARTY'S HERE.](https://media.giphy.com/media/qeGFZ8yYufutq/giphy.gif)

Near the end of my drinking career, when my depression and anxiety were so out of control, and only made worse by alcohol, I would be blacked out by 7PM on Friday nights and calling/texting people, lamenting in my own pity party, while alone on my stoop and chain smoking cigarettes. Weekends weren't rejuvenating; they were time for my addiction to take full control. I look back at the pain I was in and wish I could just hug myself. I don't know how in this world I got sober.

I suppose I'm not any less lonely on Friday nights, since it's just me and the pups, but it *feels* less lonely. My solitude on Friday isn't engulfed in sadness, but in gratitude. And with that, I can calmly appreciate my learns throughout the work week, the lull of Humphrey's snore, and quietly go to sleep, with excitement of productiviy, exercise and friendship the following day.

What's your Friday night look like to you? IWNDWYT.",118

It’s currently going on 3am where I live and I’ve been awake for the past who knows how many hours dealing with crippling anxiety, regret and self-loathing. I don’t think I have to explain to anyone here what that feels like. 

About 2 months ago I started going to meetings. I got myself a sponsor and have been doing all the “good on paper” things a sober girl should do. 

But I haven’t managed to stay sober for longer than a week and I realized today... or maybe knew all along... that I haven’t been taking sobriety seriously because I have a trip coming up at the end of March that I’ve been planning to drink on all along. 

The trip is 24 days away and I want to get on that plane with 24 days of sobriety behind me. I want it more than I’ve ever wanted anything in my life, though I’ve said it before. 

So I’m writing this to ask if any of you have gotten sober with an event looming in the future that you knew you’d want to experience with alcohol. Did you make it? How? What kind of mindset do I need to settle into? 

Yes I know, one day at a time. But I’m a planner. I like to have things laid out clearly in front of me and minimize (negative) surprises. Please help me do this. 

Thank you and IWNDWYT",7

It was freezing cold, and sleet was coming down hard. The next thing I really remember is the awkwardly, sweet smell from the deployed airbags. I narrowly survived after hitting a telephone pole in a Miata. I destroyed my left knee and ankle in the impact. I was told later that a witness saw me put the car in reverse and do a backwards “Dukes of Hazard” jump off a ledge into a construction site. I’m still not sure how the car managed. The police and EMS showed up. Like an idiot, I refused treatment. I was arrested. I was just glad at that point to be in a warm patrol car. I spent the next day in lockup. Being in that cell and handcuffed to another poor drunk sap at arraignment are still etched in my memory. My attorney said the video from the scene was a real shit show. I plead and got 15 months of probation and some community service. In all honesty, I got off easily. You would think that would have been enough to change my ways. Unfortunately, it was only recently that I finally broke the cycle. 

Reading this group has made me think a lot. I finally figured out why I don’t seem to have cravings. It’s because I can’t keep hurting myself senselessly. I feel like I’ve been in an abusive relationship with a brutal partner. I really just couldn’t take it any longer. Thanks to everyone on here for sharing your experiences. I’m glad to be alive.

Yes/No? 🤔,"I understand that this is a controversial subject amongst the sober community at large, but it’s something I’m grappling with and I think an influx of differing opinions on the matter could potentially be helpful.

For some context, I’ve used marijuana recreationally for the last 3 years. I started using it when I last quit alcohol and as a result I managed 15 months sober from alcohol. However when I relapsed I used both alcohol and marijuana to essentially “numb” myself.

I’m 3 days sober again from alcohol and whilst I’ve found marijuana to be useful, more than useful really to manage symptoms of withdrawal (especially where pain from abdominal cramping is concerned)
I wonder is it another crutch/substitute for alcohol? 

I by no means “smoke all day” I’m not waking up for breakfast bongs (no judgement, simply outlining my personal habit) but as a rule I stick to a joint or 2 in the evenings, I find there to be no consequences to this behaviour.

 But I would like to know how you other sober folks feel about it from both sides, those that are pro marijuana and those against it? 
Thanks in advance for your input 😊✌️

I am looking into changing careers, but I can’t do so immediately for financial reasons. I’m covered in bruises for no reason. I’m tired. All the time. I’m sad as hell. I’m broke, not because I make shitty money, but because I’ve spent it all going out drinking like everyone else I know.

Please tell me I can actually stop drinking and still have a life... Have more of a life! I know I need to leave the service industry and I want to get into social work but I’ve been doing this for 15 years and financially have to plan an exit strategy. I guess I’m looking for support until then.

It took a lot of time for me to get to this point. And to be honest, I can’t guarantee this will last in the future. But the beauty of taking this moment to moment means the future is irrelevant. I’m doing fantastic right now, and all I have to keep doing is staying sober in the moment.

alcohol extremly damages the brain chemistry,  and from a biologically perspective, nothing else as damaged brain chemistry makes people behave ,,crazy“.

Sometimes the insanity goes away when sober again, but if you‘re unlucky, the insanity will stay forever, the more you drink, when you get irreparable nerve and brain chemistry damage.

Isn‘t it insane that we were okay with it for so long? Why throw away sanity for coping and relaxing?

I don't use them as an ""alcohol substitute"" or ""alcohol alternative"". I look at them more like an alternative to water or coffee or tea.

The taste of alcoholic beverages isn't  the trigger or problem for me, it was the effects of alcohol that I was after. Didn't matter what the shit taste like. 

Avoiding things like whiskey alternative and non alcoholic beer  because they resemble alcoholic beverages is letting alcohol control your decisions. That is not a life free from alcohol. That's a life avoiding alcohol. Bottom line, it's a non alcoholic drink. Regardless if it resembles the taste of a alcoholic beverage or not. (Yes I know even NA beer has very minute traces of alcohol. But no more than what's in kombucha, or  some mouthwash, and medicines. Again it was the effects of alcohol I was after, not the taste.)

Where do you draw the line though? Do you stay away from bourbon BBQ sauce? White wine butter sauces? No red wine in your beef bourguigon? Most skin care products contain alcohol. And Febreeze for your fabrics contain alcohol. 

How does it make any sense to avoid a product that contains absolutely zero alcohol, such as ritual's whiskey alternative, but yet use products that list alcohol in the ingredients? Is it because its consumed? Is it because its marketed as a whiskey alternative? 

Bet it wouldn't offend people in my AA group if it was labeled as an all natural organic low calorie herbal drink?

I used to drink vodka with orange juice. Alcoholic drink, right? Ok minus the vodka. It's a screwdriver alternative. No bruh its f*ckin orange juice, and I still drink it.

So to recap, If I stopped drinking orange juice all together bc it reminded me of alcohol. Thats avoidance. That's alcohol calling the shots.... still.

Got some good things accomplished and feel good about that. With the self reflection and therapy taking life one day at a time, I am proud of the steps I’ve taken and who I am becoming. I was a good person before and with this new found commitment sobriety I can only be better. This gives me a renewed sense of self respect and confidence. But I have this nagging thought in the back of my mind that this is who I should have been for all those years. Supportive, humble, grateful, attentive and motivated. I am aware that I can’t change the past but I like this guy and I wish for the ones I love that it wouldn’t have taken so long and cost so much for him to step out of the shadows because even if I couldn’t see it, he was always there.

I have been a binge drinker since college, I’m 27 now.  I work Monday-Thursday and I generally don’t drink Monday-Wednesday unless I had a huge weekend bender or am going through something stressful.  I mostly drink at home which keeps me out of trouble for the most part.  The problem is when I drink too much Thursday and wake up with a hangover Friday, I end up drinking all weekend.  It’s been progressively getting worse.  I’ve moved to a small town with no bar in town which has helped keep me out of trouble, but last weekend I went to my hometown to hang out with some old friends and go ice fishing, which ended in a fight Friday night and getting kicked out of another bar for being belligerent Saturday night.  Generally I’m a happy drunk, but if I get in a bar and start taking shots I tend to get in fights or get belligerent.  I have a college degree with a decent job, just bought a house, a new truck and I don’t want to throw that all away over a stupid mistake.  I’ve somehow avoided ending up in jail over the past 6 years or so, but I’ve finally had enough and realized it’s time to quit.  On my way home from work on Thursdays I get extreme cravings for alcohol and tell myself I’ll only have a few but we all know how that goes.  Tonight is the first night I can remember not drinking Thursday and the cravings are pretty intense.  I’ve also given up a lot of my hobbies because of my drinking habits or I’ve integrated drinking into my hobbies, which makes me dread going out and doing things with my friends because I know I’ll get drunk and make an ass of myself.  I also tend to drink more during the winter months as most of my hobbies are outdoor or garage activities, so this makes it even harder not to drink.  Anybody else share similar experiences?",25

Just trying to stay active and reflective on all of my actions while really trying to quit again. Im such a habit person so its hard for me to to not repeat yesterday.

Something that stuck with me was when my dad kind of called me out on not being right emotionally:  “everytime i visit, you dont have massive speakers blasting sabbath and shit anymore??? Is something wrong??? Wheres the drumset and guitar amps??!?”

Its a reflection for myself that when im depressed, i lose that energy to bump the hell out of 12in/15in speakers.

If you’re hurting right now.... give yoursef a short 5 minutes without human contact and jam the hell out to your favorite song. Idk if itll work for you but its been giving me confidence energy back. Im doing it right now to rage against the machine before anyone gets back home :)

I love you all! I went back to the hippy AA mtn town meeting available and it made me feel better too. YOU ARENT ALONE! Tons of us struggle with this shit. Its hard as hell and it doesnt make u weak to say, im done drinking.. i just cant control it!

I play the game like the rest yet I am not a sociopath like some of these people. Ugh. Some make my skin crawl the way they talk about people's livelihoods. This is such a broken system and I am feeling I become more and more like 'them' after every day at work. Back stabbing hurts but oh well. I am racking it in and then I will do something better for humanity within 10 years unless there is another '08. I donate as well to worthy causes I truly believe in.

I am not perfect & I give my best effort to influence but like anyone... my reach is limited.

Does this resonate with anyone?

I am a bit frustrated and overworked yet still trying to improve things and feeling discouraged yet motivated. There is a lot of cognitive dissonance as a reader can probably tell...

Thank you in advance for taking the time out to read. More than anything, typing this out will provide catharsis.

While normally a contractor, I had to take a full-time position last year. It was fine at first, but within the second week coworkers were ""joking"" about past employees having to go on Xanax to deal with the anxiety of the owners and their demands. As you can probably guess, this turned out to be somewhat correct—just with bourbon instead of Xanax.

From 2010–2018, I had gone from 320lbs (145.14kg) to 210lbs (95.25kg) through a combo of medication, mindfulness, and distance running. Since 2015, I've completed 8 marathons and hope to complete many more.

In 2019, I barely ran at all. I spent so many long nights at the office trying to keep up and make the ever-changing deadlines. The bourbon helped my mood and made me relax. Towards the end of my time there, I was drinking 750ml of Knob Creek every other day—starting at 6:30am when I would roll into the office. I was drunk most days, but I'm very functional (the worst parlor trick).

Even after leaving the company for good, I would continue to drink heavily. It felt good and I associated it with stress relief. Creating different infusions and learning to make cocktails taught me that it was an interest, not a terrible crutch. After another drunken stupor last night, I took a hard look at myself: now 260lbs (117.93kg) with barely any clothes that fit, completely miserable, and with my only good feelings coming while not actually being myself.

This morning, I dumped it all down the drain. I could've gifted some of the infusions, but those gifts wouldn't have truly come from me—it would've come from the person that I don't want to be. My mission is to get my real life back. I can barely run a mile now without feeling like I'm going to puke, but I signed up for a race this summer.

I'm disappointed that I allowed myself to fall so far, but I'm incredibly proud that I am finally doing something about it. 

Thanks again for reading.",961

My initial goal was a week, then a month. My initial plan was to take a break then try and do better and learn to control myself. I was drinking up to an equivalent of 30 standard drinks a week.

During my break I found this sub. Then I read people suggesting the book This Naked Mind which I read and I found it eye opening. Also seen the suggestions of Alcohol Explained and Allen Carr Quit Drinking without Willpower which I read those too. I'm not one to read books but I found all of these very informative and totally changed my feelings about drinking.

I've decided to quit while I'm ahead as a 48 year old. For myself and for my wife and 18 year old son who often suggests I stop drinking.

I hope my motivation holds as strong as it has been this last month. I don't even have a desire to drink anymore.

I've been single for 10 years, I took the ending of a three year relationship really really bad and never been with anyone in any ""official"" capacity since.

Being single allowed me to do as I pleased and a self serving, hedonistic life was allowed to develop and thrive with full knowledge of the damage I was doing to myself but way back in the beginning of the heaviest drinking, I was doing it with the intention of hastening my own death, really sad to actually admit that! 

Now I know that being a month into sobriety is early days and I wouldn't dream of rushing into something so huge as dating and relationships right now but the thoughts are ever present, I'm feeling all nostalgic for all the human emotions I felt before my slow suicide attempt and those blissful, simple moments keep flashing in my mind. 

Sat here in my bed, in my perfectly presented bedroom watching mindless youtube videos, how nice would it would be to have someone by my side. 

What an odd mood I'm in this evening, yet another gift of sobriety feeling human feelings. I suppose I'm feeling a little lonely tonight, but it's not a bad feeling though, it's a hopeful feeling like something I can expect in the future when I'm ready and I can look forward to it.

So Im currently 40 days without drinking which is not necessarily unusual for me. Ive tried dozens of times to stop drinking and am able to stick with it for a while but then I begin to forget how awful it was when I was drinking and start thinking that I can go out and have a good time. This time however is different Ive had horrible experiences in the past where Ive turned in to a complete asshole while blackout and that has prompted me to start the process of getting sober. About 40 days ago though I ended an 8 day straight bender that involved ever clear and not eating for the entire duration. It was a horrendous experience and I experienced the worst withdrawls Ive ever had for days after I stopped drinking. I was terrified I was going to have a seizure and die. I was also in a very remote area and unable to go to a hospital so I had to just pull through it and hope it didnt kill me. This was the absolute final straw for me and I cannot drink again. In the past when I tried to get sober I never used any resources other than a quit drinking app. This time however Im committed to finally putting an end to this. What resources do you all use to keep yourself on track? As I mentioned at the start of my post the primary cause of previous relapses is that after a month or two I begin to forget exactly how bad it was and remember the fun I used to have. So how do you all remind yourselves just exactly what it felt like when you were drinking? I saved all the messages I sent while I was going through withdrawls explaining how awful it was and Im hoping that record will keep me from a relapse but if anyone has any advice Id greatly appreciate it.,8

2020-02-27 14:15:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fah6xr/halfassing_aa_can_i_continue_to_do_this/,Half-assing AA – can I continue to do this?,"Happy Thursday and happy International Polar Bear Day! So sorry for the long post but I'm feeling annoyed and confused right now.

I've been going to AA meetings for just over a month now, maybe three times a week. I have friends I sit next to now and lots of people's numbers in my phone. Some of the girls invited me to go with them to an AA conference in Sacramento this weekend, and I actually think I might go. (S/O to ACYPAA, anyone else going?)

It brings me great relief to hear other people's stories and share my own. I feel so at peace when I leave a meeting. I've learned that many of my behaviors are shared by the group, which helps me identify areas for personal growth. When people repeat my name back to me, I feel listened to and acknowledged in my suffering, and that has made me feel much less alone.

*Side note: My first meeting was actually Al-Anon! I thought they were the same as AA and went accidentally. There, I found a very supportive group of people who offered me homemade cookies, gave me hugs, and invited me out to dinner afterwards. I still go to that group, but I can't share all of the things that I'd like to share there out of respect for the purpose of Al-Anon.*

People in my meetings have been bugging me to get a sponsor, start the steps, etc. I'm not 100% opposed, but I'm also not convinced that's the only way to do it. When prompted, I've tried to explain This Naked Mind's philosophy that addiction is partially fueled by cultural perceptions of alcohol, which is itself a poison, and that you're not missing out on anything by choosing not to drink. (This is how I understand the book, at least.) I've only spoken with a few AA people about this, but they all seem rather set on the idea that alcoholism is a permanent quality of a person, a ""character defect"" that can be treated (but not removed) by surrendering to God.

I was told very pointedly that people who don't find sponsors tend to relapse and that I am foolish for thinking I know better than the program. I think that often people's parental instincts kick in and they feel like they have to give me advice because I'm quite young. Still don't appreciate the condescension.

The God thing annoys me too. I agree with AA that humility and service are great principles, but I don't think it makes me egotistical to think I have control over my actions. I don't have control over the addictive properties of alcohol, but as a neuroscience student, I choose to understand that based on biochemistry rather than the power of a God.

I wish we had SMART recovery in my town, but we don't. And I don't think online meetings would have the same effect for me. I like making friends and having that personal contact. And I love getting chips for milestones.

**I guess my questions are these: Is it disrespectful to continue to go to AA meetings if I'm not planning on ""working the steps""? Has anyone else felt similarly about these aspects of the program? Did you find a way to work the steps that was more based on TNM's ideas? What did you say to people to explain your own method of recovery without invalidating theirs?**

I stopped a couple of days ago, and before that, had all of the feelings, guilt, shame, remorse, disgust with my actions related to drinking.

Thankfully, my partner had the courage to say something. Not in a judgy way, but to admit that since I took up drinking wine again, it was like there was a veil between us in our relationship. Definitely  not helping with the  major life change/stress of moving into a new home.

I am officially at one month, which seemed absolutely impossible...well, a month ago. I am 26 years old and am taking control of a life that was dangerously close to spinning out. I have already seen dramatic changes - both physically and mentally - and am falling in love with this person I’ve been hiding for so long. The last time I didn’t drink for this long was probably when I was 17. That’s a really surreal thing to wrap my head around that - I feel like I’m getting to know that sweet girl and welcoming her back. Booze took her away from me in so many ways. Of course, there are hard days, and my anxiety is still something I grapple with. I have a lot of things to work on, and a lot of forgiving I have to do of myself and of others. 

To anyone who is struggling, silently or openly, there is a better reality than the one you are currently experiencing. I urge you to free the person you are meant to be - I guarantee they are happier, funnier, sexier, smarter, and kinder than the one you are trying so desperately to unlock with booze.

Today I looked at my fitbit dashboard for the first time and was astounded at the immediate effect I am seeing in my overall health.

I started a diet at the beginning of January, and eliminating the calories from alcohol has had a great effect on my weight loss.  currently I am down 25 (245->220 33YO Male) lbs since the start of the year.  

I have been closely monitoring my weight, and proud of my accomplishments, but I was especially floored to see that my resting heart rate BPM has decreased 25%.

On 1-28, fitbit clocked my resting heart rate at 82 BPM, today it sits at 60 BPM.  I am a data professional, and love having metrics to track... so this is just further motivation that my sobriety, weight loss, and health all go hand-in-hand.  

Anyone else experiencing a renaissance of health benefits (measurable or immesurable)?  I'd love to hear others' successes.

I've been lurking for a while but I haven't had the courage to post anything to this point. Happenstance changed that today however. 

I was at work (I'm a welder) listening to my music while doing my work when a song came on. The song was ""I Have a Problem"" by Beartooth. This actually was the push I needed to finally say something. 

I'm 28 years old and I have been drinking since I turned 21. I realized when I turned 21 that drinking shoved my problems to the side for as long as I was drunk and so anytime I became overwhelmed that's what I did. I don't drink constantly or even super frequently. Regularly though. More often than not I'm drinking on Friday and Saturday nights because it's easier than being in my head. All that being said I started my journey to quit drinking about 3 weeks ago thanks to seeing all of the encouraging posts and progress reports in this subreddit. It is sorely tempting to drink still though and I basically struggle every time I have to grocery shop or see alcohol in restaurants. I want to be able to make strides to fix the things in my life instead of just putting them off constantly. I want to be better. 

Thanks for listening to me and thank you for those with the courage to talk in this place. You've helped me take the first steps. For anyone that wants to listen to the song I will include the link but it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea to be fair.

No big deal you may think. Its the change in my mindset that I wanted to share.

When I drank, all I thought about was when would my shift finish and when could I leave work and go to the pub.

When I drank, all I thought about when I was in the pub was getting in those extra couple of drinks as the bell rang for last orders so that I had more than one before getting a ride home.

When I drank, all I thought about on the way home was opening a bottle and having more alcohol before going to sleep.

&#x200B;

Today, on the 27th day of my second attempt to stop drinking, I decided to repair some old wristwatches. They've been lying around in a drawer waiting for me to take a look at them.

I have the tools. I have the ability. When I drank, I just didn't want to use either. I was either hungover or drunk.

Today, I got the tools out, made some space on my dining table, and got to work.

After an hour of tinkering and fault finding I have a fully functioning watch. The push buttons work correctly, the strap is clean, the body of the watch has had a polish.

The watch is charging its solar battery while the sun sets.

I'm looking forward to hearing the chime of the alarm from that watch at 7 tomorrow morning.

Its the little things that count. The motivation mojo is coming back.

Wherever you are, whatever it is that you do, if you've done something, you're winning.

If you've got out of bed and done something you've been avoiding, you're winning.

If you didn't have a drink today, yep, you guessed it, you're winning.

60.

I posted about this before, how not drinking has made me face my feelings—for better or worse. What I’ve noticed over these two months is that i am lacking a feeling of excitement. 

I’m currently facing a number of things that have me down—I hate my job and my husband’s health is a giant question mark at the moment—but I’ve noticed that I’m just not looking forward to anything, or excited, or even fun.

The last few times I went out to eat with friends I realized that I had very little to talk about, that I wasn’t as funny as I usually am, and that I was mainly just ready to go home and get under the covers.

I couldn’t help but wonder if maybe alcohol was what made me more talkative or funny or...idk...

I have zero desire to start drinking again. It’s not something on my mind, I’m just more curious to know if this feeling is partially due to this change in my lifestyle and needing to kind of recalibrate myself, in addition to the other shit going on in my life, or if it’s mainly that I’m probably a bit depressed.

2020-02-27 09:04:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/facj8k/500_days/,500 Days!,"  

Well today I am 500 days sober! It’s feels unreal for me to say that. Here’s the thing about getting sober. It doesn’t make your problems go away. However, it gives you the motivation and mental bandwidth to do what you can to fix your problems and improve your life. I can’t numb this stuff anymore so I may as well try to fix it right?

A year and a half ago I was struggling. I was keeping it together… but just barely. I have a small business that was I wasn’t on top of. I was overweight and unhealthy. My family life was suffering. I was unhappy.

Today, all that has turned around. Life is much better in literally every way. Ways I’ve benefited in the last 500 days:

Lost 40 pounds and overall much healthier

Saved lots of money (my sober tracker says $5,000 but its much more than that)

Business is doing well 

Family life is great

Way less anxiety and stress

A sense of just being in control of my life again

I would describe myself as very content/happy now

Life isn’t perfect. I’ve gone through a couple “funks” through this time. Right now I’ve got a close friend who was diagnosed with late stage cirrhosis a couple months ago due to alcohol. He’s back in the hospital right now actually. I struggle with how to help him (he doesn’t want my help). I wonder, “am I pushing him too hard, am I not pushing him enough?” I also feel guilt for not trying to help him earlier. 

Also I have a young child with severe special needs and spends a lot of time in the hospital. The stress from that really ramped up my drinking. I believed I needed it to cope. But I was so wrong. I am way more capable of handling all these things sober. 

Anyway, I owe much of my success to this sub. I’ve read books and listened to podcasts that have helped, but it wasn’t until my first post that made it stick

To the newcomers, keep coming here. Never give up. From the time it hit me that alcohol was the problem and I absolutely needed to quit, to the time it finally stuck, was about two and a half years. Lots of starts and stops in between. I’m still not really sure what made it stick the last time. Know that it gets easier. Those first days and weeks are brutal. But I promise you it gets so much better. 

Any way that’s my story for now. Going forward I’d like to take a more active role in this sub. I’ve mainly been a lurker. Also I’m kicking around the idea of trying AA. I haven’t felt an urge to drink in a long time, but I’m learning sobriety is something that needs some maintenance. 

Please forgive me for my username. In the past I was heavily into craft beer and homebrewing and it was the name of a beer I made. I’m embarrassed that I used to think that was funny.

I woke up with a pretty bad headache this morning but I don't feel like death like the version of me that drank did. I think some of the headache has to do with a lack of sugar. Day 90 marks another change for me. I started yesterday cutting back all the extra soda and candy bars and all that junk I allowed myself to help me stay sober. I think doing so will even out my mood and energy levels a good bit. I am switching to black coffee for caffeine at first, but that will get cut eventually too. Not wanting to tackle too much at once. I know people talk about day 90 a lot when it comes to recovery. Like I said, it is getting easier, but vigilance and mindfulness are still required.",47

I'm 21 years old, close to 22, and have been drinking heavily ever since I moved out of my mom's place at 20. For the first couple of months I would only
get alcohol whenever I couldnt get any weed. Fast forward to when I turned 21 and it turned into a bottle of vodka bought on a Friday and i would drink every night until the bottle was gone, usually only took about 4 days. wait a week or so and do it again. It eventually lead to pretty much daily drinking and I wouldnt eat anything beforehand most days so I could get drunk faster.

I ended up moving back in with my mom in November of last year and there is always alcohol at the house. Wine, whiskey, tequila, vodka, seltzer; anytime it's there I have some. my mom and brother are heavy drinkers at times. my moms friends have brought alcohol over and drank until the sun comes up. my sister drinks casually but still has alcohol in the house sometimes. This made me feel like it was more okay to drink heavily since it was always around. I also grew up with an alcoholic father. I have tried to quit a handful of times in the last 6 months but the longest I ever went was only 9 days last month. After those 9 days I went on a bender and always had alcohol. before work, right after I got home, anytime i could drink I did. This lasted until monday 2/24 when my family came to me and told me I'm drinking too much.

I fully understand that and was embarrassed that they had to say something and felt intense shame. The thing is I told them I'm trying to quit and become fully sober and no one is supporting that decision, just that I need to drink less. ""oh quit? why not just slow down?"" I left for 2 days and asked them to either drink the rest of my supply theirselves or throw it out and I came back to it all still there. 

How do I quit when I see the temptation every day. Even if my stuff is gone there are wine bottles on the counter, vodka in the freezer, whiskey in the room my computer is in. It's not like I can ask them to get rid of their alcohol right? I have the willpower of a toddler and I need help. Yesterday was my Day 1, again and I just want a drink. I have a supportive, sober boyfriend but dont and cant live with him anytime soon. Thank you if you read this far and I apologize for any errors as I'm writing this on my phone. I just need some words of support I guess. I dont want to live like this anymore, I know I'm killing myself slowly. It is so hard to stop though.",3

I’m the daughter of an alcoholic mom and have memories of her drunk as far back as I can remember. She walked out on our family when I was about my kids’ age now. I couldn’t ever imagine leaving them. She’s a terrible person for a lot of reasons, but I’ve always blamed most of her bad decisions on her addiction. I don’t want to be like that for my kids. I don’t want them ashamed of me. I don’t want to be resented. Above all, I don’t want to end up so far into this addiction that I do something to lose them.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thanks for all the tips and tools yesterday, lovely SDers! I was grateful to utilize some throughout the day. Last night, I finished Week Six of a ten week workshop on Brene Brown's research on shame. Know how to shut down a love interest really quick? Starting off with that you're nine months in recovery and attend a weekly workshop on shame. Ah, the joys of being single and knocking on 32's door.

I digress. My journey and path hasn't been what I thought in my youthful days that my life would lead, but it sure is healthier than where I've been. I've been watching this show on Showtime called Kidding, which stars Jim Carrey as a Mr. Rogers figure who has something tragic happen to him, and his downward spiral by not addressing those feelings. It's actually been extremely cathartic to me and helped me process my ex husband's affair with my best friend, my consequential divorce and the path sobriety has taken me.

What are your shows, movies or books (I'm going to get a lot of The Naked Mind responses, I'm ready) that have mirrored or assisted in your recovery? Part of the human condition is telling our stories. Through stories, we have connection. Shame cannot live in the light; in order for it to dissipate, we have to know we're not alone, and we do that by listening to other's stories. So what stories have helped you? IWNDWYT!",71

Well...then I got the idea to post something similar to my Facebook...to every single person that I know and knows me. Yeah, little bit bigger right? For only 2-3 paragraphs, I probably spent an hour editing it and making sure the grammar was okay (I still missed some stuff lol). So with trembling fingers, I hit that ""post"" button and slammed my laptop shut. I wasn't expecting more than a few likes or comments from family or maybe an old friend. Then my phone buzzed. It buzzed again. And again. Again, again, again all from Facebook notifications. Dozens of people were reacting to it. People I knew, people I didn't know, people I thought hated me. Nothing but positive comments and love from strangers. Then later that day I got a message from my bestfriend/ex. She's the person that was affected by my drinking, she stuck by me through the worst of it because  I was supposed to get better (another story for another time). Her message said ""I saw your Facebook post. That was a really brave thing for anyone to do but especially you. My heart hurt when I was reading it."" She wouldn't go into much more detail as to what she meant and I've since blocked her from all forms of contact because I have to move on an I can't do that if she's around. I just thought someone might have an insight or opinion on the matter. That's all.

I guess this is somewhat of an introduction for myself. I probably don't drink more than some of you, but if I'm being honest I probably do drink more than a few. It's been a long time since I've been truly drunk, but it's also been a long time since I haven't gone more than a few days with getting a buzz. The temptation to get a buzz every evening, and the comfort that looking forward to it brought, has been growing like a rising tide for years. If I'm being honest, there are opportunities and goals that I haven't achieved in my life, because of alcohol. I know if I don't stop soon  it will start causing more serious problems in other parts of my life.

Today marks the beginning of lent. I am a protestant Christian.  Not all of you share my faith or even understand it, but it is important to me. My specific faith tradition is also a foundational part of my identity. Anyway, lent is a time of fasting. Tonight we have ashes placed on our forehead to remind us that the sins our our life have died and been laid to rest, and will die an be laid to rest again. We are reminded that new life springs from the death of our old self.

I have been able to cut back on my drinking in the past, and each time has been at the start of lent. But this time, I don't want to take a half measure. I really don't want to fall off the horse either in the middle, or sometime after the end of the season. So this time two things are different. First, I am giving up drinking entirely, rather than cutting back. I will still hang out with my friends when they drink (though not when they drink to excess) and I will not drink. Not around them, and not at home alone.

The second thing that I'm doing is that I will post on here ever week. Every Sunday I will come on here and make a post, telling everyone whether or not I've been able to keep up my vow not to drink.

I hope to continue not drinking after lent is over too, but the next 46 days feels like an important first step. Maybe one day I can be a moderate drinker. But, maybe first I need to confront a few things in life that I've been putting off with the comfort of alcohol.",2

My mom died super fucking unexpectedly and horribly and it ruined me. She adored me and I loved the shit out of her and we were each other's ""people"". Nonstop contact, decorated my house, adored each other yadda yadda.. she was the best person in my life. When I was 30, I hit her with a whammy and told her I was with a woman and after a day to just let her mind be blown, she accepted my significant other into the family and adorned her with presents and love. 
I drank frequently before she died, (maybe 3x a week binge style) but since, I've become somewhat of a functioning alcoholic. I fell out of an uber and tore all the tendons in my shoulder then plagued me big time and now my alcoholism is just raging against my body. I'm not healing correctly from my own perspective, and according to my doctor, my liver is inflamed. I drink half a liter of bourbon a night and it is getting very hard for me to think about my lifestyle without being super down on myself. If I don't drink, I can't fall asleep until 5 AM and my face flushes every night around 9; flushes even more while I drink. I haven't grieved properly and I have no willpower to not drink for one night. I have tried mentally. I thought about asking my doctor for antabuse because my realistic tendencies are the strongest and I know if I take it, I won't drink. Is that a good idea for the first couple of weeks? I went to two AA meetings and I enjoyed them but I feel so out of place. You guys are amazing and I know that, and I could just use some advice from the pros of reddit. Sorry for the wall of text! I respect and admire you all.",6

Thank You!,"It almost seems like so long ago... I was dabbling on some others subreddits with addiction topics, and then I thought of you folks..

I honestly can not believe how far I have come. Not drinking has just become something I do. It doesn't feel weird to say. I could care less what people think. Is it hard sometimes still, sure.. But only for a short, not even that tempting of a moment. I look back at it now like yup... Been there, done that, definitely not going back. Even as I fight with some deeper issues and habits, drinking just seems strange to me. I play the tape forward and almost laugh at where I know it would take me. I go months without even thinking about it. I even work as a semi-bartender now, and feel confident in my sobriety.

As for life... Better. I am healthier, with much less effort. I have found strength in knowing I can objectively look at my life, and change it. Nothing is off the table. I had the courage to defy a major societal expectation. Now that strength is leading me to take on some monumental challenges there is no way I would have attempted drinking. What other people find intimidating.. I find exciting.

I.... I actually enjoy not drinking. I enjoy the fresh mornings. I know this will always be something to be humble about, overconfidence is dangerous. But the strength I found in sobriety is something I don't want to give back. 

So just a quick thanks r/stopdrinking... You folks were my base for quitting. Nothing else worked... I owe quite a bit to this group. Truly, from depths of my heart I didn't know existed 4 years ago.. Thank you.",66

This week’s post is thanks to u/heartrising, who sent me another of Trommer’s poems and introduced me to an interesting voice. This poem fits my mood--I’m working hard to not fall deeper into my depression hole, a dingy and tired place. I also ran tonight, the trails a mix of icy snow and gimy mud. For whatever reason I snagged on more thorns than usual and poked myself on more staubs than normal. It is a winter night, so of course the wind was biting. The run feels so good, the discomfort so pure… in it is the burning fire that purifies, some relief, and smiles. It was hard to get myself out the door, but I am so thankful that I did. So today I am giving my thanks: for movement, for mud, and for friends like u/heartrising.

How about you, fellow sobernauts? Did you get to live thanks this week?

Today has been a literal living hell, waking sleeps and passing out, just feeling really out of it all day.  i called my family member whose a doc and broke down in tears describing my current situation, im most likely in a severe state of dehydration and thiamine withdrawal.  I was considering going in to the ER tonight, actually something that was reccomended by the family member, but i think i am feeling ok.  there is some weird shit happening with my eye but i think its just slept on wrong.  idk long story short I meet with my Dr on friday for a vivtrol consultation and just laid out my life story and struggles to someone ive only known six months but love dearly. she agreed to let me stay at her place during withdrawal so if something goes south she can get me to the ER.  ive known times where i count the minutes of withdrawal, waiting and knowing things will get better at some point. but for the first time in a long time, im counting my minutes til full sobriety, a shot in my ass, and looking back saying, ""shit that sucked but i made it through""",5
2020-02-26 23:18:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fa6gci/weird_night_but_ill_take_it/,Weird night but I’ll take it,"It’s not really a success story, but tonight I got another glimpse of what my life was vs what it could be like. 

We had a retirement party tonight for a guy I really love. We’ve done so much together and I’m really happy for him. I made it through the toasts and speeches and all of it on club soda and lime. 
A small group decided to go out after for dinner and drinks and while I probably should’ve said no, I really love this guy. 
I again made it through a couple rounds of drinks, but then they brought out the wine. I love wine. So I had a glass. And it didn’t taste like all I had hoped and imagined. And I quit. Again. 

But then retirement guy and his boss were drunk crying in the corner. Dudes 1 & 2 were fake lap dancing. Or real lap dancing? What makes it a real lap dance?
I ended up being the only sober person at the end of the night. I put two people physically into ubers with their home addresses, and helped ones wife load another into their car. I drove home and am having a cup of tea at the house now. 

I know that if I drink 10 times, 8 of those will end fine and nothing bad will happen. Those 2 other times is why I want to give it up. What if I hadn’t been sober, would those guys have tried to drive home? Would I have gotten drunk and tried to drive home? Play it forward and I don’t like that movie. 

“Something bad doesn’t happen every time I drink, but every time something bad has happened, I’ve been drinking”

Saw that quote on Instagram and it’s stuck with me. I know bad moments will always happen, but I want them to happen sober.

2020-02-26 22:58:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fa67ld/1_year_ago/,1 year ago,"1 year ago i was drunk as fuck n made this account for some random reason. Got blackout as usual. Next morning my missus said that she would leave me if i continued to drink the way i was. 

Ended up about 4 months sober then while on holiday in germany i drank a bit but kept it reasonable. Then when i got home it crept up on me again for a while. 

I have got drunk once in the last 4 months (at a mates birthday and didnt enjoy it) and also quit smoking (smoked one night at the party).

So this is my account now to remind me what i started and why. Id say 7-8 months sober over the last year which is pretty crazy after 18 years of drinking, 10+ of which were pretty fucking heavy.

I feel good. I have focus and enjoy things again. Im a better partner and dad (i think). 

Anyways i just noticed my cake day thingo so thought id make a lil post.

I've tried to quit before, and the most I've made it was around 50-55 days, then a few weeks here and there. Quitting drinking has been an experience, to say the least.

Three coworkers have told me I've lost weight/look great. I had $1000 in the bank, with no bills due (I say ""had"" because I splurged on workout equipment). Speaking of working out, I've been using my spare room as a home gym, slowly adding equipment. Theres also a planet fitness opening a mile away soon. I plan to start going as soon as it opens. 

A few days ago, I felt nauseous. I can't remember the last time I felt nauseous. I used to wake up everyday like that. Unbelievable. I can't believe I was crippling myself with alcohol. It's not worth it. Period.

Lurking here is 100% what helped me. I never post, but today, I wanted to give back some motivation, since you guys motivate me everyday.",39
2020-02-26 22:39:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/fa5yeb/156_days/,156 days,"Today, just a little over 5 months. I’m not a ranting, in denial alcoholic (although I’m still an alcoholic) . I’ll take this feeling of peace for what it is today. Because it hasn’t been easy quitting drinking and some days are much harder than others. But I guess I wanted to post about the benefits I didn’t immediately get (no hangovers will always be awesome and no regrets/having a memory from the night before is as well).

This took me a little bit to see but I think I’m attracting less negative people. It also meant solitude for me. Certain friends are kind of fading but others are being just who I need in my life. But in particular my ex who’s an alcoholic. We had an off and off relationship for years and finally it has ended. But unlike the other times I’m ready to move on with confidence, not looking back anymore. Now that I stopped drinking l’m much  more aware of what’s best for me. 

Going to self destruct mode like I have done in the past when things made me angry or sad or didn’t go my way isn’t healthy, or cool, or good for me in any way. It’s really sad that when I felt bad I wanted to feel worse in a way or not feel anything. Maybe that involved chain smoking, it probably involved drinking. But either way I had shit methods for dealing with life’s inevitable mishaps and disappointments. I can’t tell you what’s the best way to deal but I cry and let it pass, and while I’m tempted to “self destruct” I try to focus on where that has gotten me in the past.. nowhere or places worst. 

I’m not 100% happy. I didn’t lose a bunch of weight. I’m still scared about disposing this identity I have with drinking. Sometimes I still feel like I’m going to drink again but now I’m actually sort of scared to. And I know it’s not right and I guess I don’t even want to. But I’m curious to keep going with sobriety. It has only proven to serve me well (once I get over the cravings and sometimes the awkwardness of not drinking around drinkers has been the only “downfalls”).  

I still don’t know what I want to do with my life or how to like level up and move forward but I think by not drinking I have a chance to find out, at least much faster. I’m taking better care of myself in ways I didn’t pay attention to. I’m trying to work on my appearance such as my skin care. I go to the gym but sometimes I slack and get the munchies. I’m a single mom to a 5 year old son who loves me and I know he somehow knows I quit and our relationship is so much more awesome now that I’m sober. He deserves it and so do I.

But not today.,"The longest I have gone without drinking in the past 8 years is two days. I had my first beer when I was 15 and absolutely loved it, since the age of 18 I have drunk almost every day, to excess. Having two beers with a friend I could never do, it was always 12, maybe a bit less if they were higher strength. 

Fast forward to two years ago and I started working at a small brewery. An absolute dream job for me, drinking beer and getting paid for it, not only that but the beer was FREE. Couldn't be better right? Wrong. My anxiety, which has always been an issue, sky rocketed. I would wake up everyday at 4am and start vomiting (not from being hungover, though, I usually was) until leaving for work at 7 and struggle through work in an anxiety induced haze just to make it to the end of the day when I could grab some beer from the company fridge (the high strength ones) and get as maggoted as I could before having to go to bed, to do it all again the next day. In the worst weeks I would lose \~2kg a week from an inability to eat. Partly from hangover induced nausea, partly from anxiety.

I had a total mental breakdown right before Christmas last year and quit my job. That was hard but I had to do it as the drinking was taking a huge toll on me, physically and mentally. I have spent the past two months sitting in my room hating myself for position I have put myself and my partner in and the relationships I had to break off to get out of there (I really liked the people I worked with). My plan was to use some time off work to work on myself. Instead I have shut myself away, going outside, albeit briefly, about once every three days. My plan was to stop drinking but instead all I did was use it as an excuse to get more fucked up, without having to work with a hangover.

I am sick of it now. Well, to be fair I always always sick of it, but it's reached impossible levels. I'm going to stop drinking, clean myself up and move on with my life. I'm still young, I have an incredibly supportive and loving partner and have everything going for me. The one thing that has always been holding me back is the booze. I realize that now. On the days off over the past few years the cravings that I have had have been bad, but the payoff will be worth every moment.

I'm so glad I found this beautiful place to share! You are all so inspiring and know that greatness is within you!  
I thought I would share my first post and tell you a bit of my story. Today I found a website that actually made me have an epiphany and see the truth of what alcohol REALLY is. It made me realize that alcohol is the most failed 'relationship' I have ever had. It put to me the notion that if I see my relationship with it (alcohol) as I would a bad relationship I have had to overcome; I can then see it for all the bad that it has ever done to me. This is it's true nature. So much bad...  
  When I thought about it, all the bad things alcohol has done to me, my life and my loved ones, I felt hatred toward it. I remembered being in a bad abusive relationship with a previous partner who really hurt me. I loved him, I thought I did anyway, and although he was very bad to me, it was so hard to leave him. I overcame that relationship by remembering all the bad that he did to me which in time made me stop loving him and actually forget him.   
 Today is the day I have decided to never allow this 'relationship' in my life again. I will remind myself of all the bad that it has ever done to me and say 'boy byeeeeeee'!!!!! Hehehe.   
  Today is the day I say goodbye to alcohol for good, & I see it for it's truth and hate it!   
  I am so happy to find this group and I look forward to reading all your posts and again I just wanted to say we are all love, let's give that love to ourselves first. You are greatness! Have a happy day/evening wherever you are in the world xoxo",8

I've been trying to get sober since Feb 2017-ish. Longest I've ever gone is like 90 days. I've been on a bender basically for months, with daily drinking (in secret). I'm a mom of 2 young children and happily married. My husband hasn't caught me drinking the amounts I have been and has no idea how many nights I drink by myself under the guise of ""watching tv"" downstairs while he watches for real upstairs. (I like a lot of trashy TV that he can't stand, so he happily lets me watch alone). He's also a early to bed/early to rise kind of guy while I'm a night owl. I drink til I am ready to pass out, then hide my empty bottles in various places around the house. 

Anyway, I'm super duper ready to give this a try again, for 1 million reasons. Lately I've been especially paranoid he will find my hidden empties so I figured I'd better get them out of the house. I found these empties:

\~ twelve 12-packs of cider

8 liters of vodka

2 handles of whiskey

4 mags of wine

31 airplane sized flavored vodkas

As I was pulling empties from my various hiding places and putting them on the dining room table, I was horrified. These were all from the last month. 

I bagged up everything and took them to our community recycling hub. 

It was such a gut punch to see the sheer volume of what I'd been \*secretly\* drinking (and doesn't even include all the drinks I've had out with hubs/friends in the same time period). Add that to all the other reasons why I want/need to quit and I was just like...wow....

It definitely was very sobering (see what I did there?! :P). I took a picture of them so I have something to look back on. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my long post. Day 1 is almost in the books. 

TL;DR - cleaned out a month's worth of empties I'd had hidden around the house and almost fell over dead at how many there were",18

I feel like for me, the first 21 days were the easiest. I caught myself wondering about my ability to drink with moderation today. It is hard to keep on track. I feel good with myself but I do have cravings during the day. Even if I would mostly abuse alcohol alone at night, these moments are never the ones that are triggering for me. I love being by myself sober. It’s in the day time that I’m thinking about drinking a lot. Where I work, people drink constantly. There is always a bottle of wine opened, or two. Today I had to fight hard to not give in. I’m glad but I also feel down that I won’t be able to drink with moderation probably in my life.",7

I have been on this site off and on for a couple of years now and have yet to make it past a couple of months without falling back into my old habits. Yesterday I drank 2 bottles of wine by myself, which in itself is bad enough, but , when I drink to that extent I love to make phone calls to family members. I usually end up pissing them off, but because of my intoxicated state, I am completely unaware of what I said the next day. (AKA..the blackout). at this point of the day, anxiety has completely taken over as it usually does. How many times can you apologize for the same behavior, before it is no longer forgiven? I thank God for such an amazing family that still loves me through it all. I have tried to identify my triggers, which I feel I have done for the most part, the question for me is how do I avoid them? The biggest trigger I think is loneliness and boredom. My Husband travels a lot for work, leaving me at home alone weekly. Our children are grown and no longer live at home. I stick to a strict 5:00 pm rule before I take the first drink. I don't have any desire to drink anything all day until then, and at 5:00, all of the willpower I have magically goes out the window.  We moved into this house just over a year ago so I really don't know too many people. (The people that I have met are all drinkers as well). I have tried a few AA groups locally, but I just don't ever really feel comfortable. I guess I should try and visit this site more often as it has helped in the past. Thank you all for letting me vent and as the mantra for this site says; I will not drink with you today",3

I’ve never made it this far. For some reason in the past I always cracked at big milestones. 30 days, woohoo, you did that so you can do it just a little! (My autocorrect just changed that sentence to “can’t do it just a little.” If that’s not a sign, I don’t know what is).

There’s been a lot of little victories, but lately I’ve been pretty tempted. I have a big conference to attend next week and a presentation to give that has been stressing me out. I keep playing the tape forward and reminding myself that if I drink, I won’t do the work, I’ll feel awful, my head will be cloudy, and it’s a great reminder of how out of it and less capable I felt while I was drinking.

But I’ve still been romanticizing the thought all week. A few minutes ago I glanced over and saw my husband’s half empty wine glass from last night sitting on the bedside table. At first I was thinking about how I could just have a sip, but then I really looked at it.

Half dried up red wine lines the cup in a ring just a little above the remaining liquid. Dark dried on drips around the rim. The wine itself has a little bit of that oily looking film. Grainy looking bits have settled into the bottom of the cup.

I used to just grab the same glass I left half empty and chug the remainder sometime during the next day. Half the time I’d notice the filmy bit a little too late and almost immediately throw up (the gag reflex is strong with me). If it wasn’t there, I’d just fill it back up and keep drinking out of the same old dirty glass. I can’t tell you how many times I pulled a dead gnat out with my finger, thought meh, can’t waste good wine (good? let’s be real, it was Franzia, but alcohol equaled good in my mind) and drank it anyway.

Dried up, sedimented wine and dead gnats is sure one hell of a way to kill the romance. I’ll be working late tonight, but I will definitely not be drinking with you tonight.",14

I'm new here and I'm so glad to find a group of people that are either in a similar situation as myself or have been in there and are on the other side. Just a little back story about me - I grew up in a religious household and I actually did not drink my first drink until approx. age 24! Now it seems crazy that I waited so long and I almost wish that I would have started earlier. Anyways, for at least the past 6 years I have been a very heavy drinker. Not compared to some but my problem is binge drinking and I do it 3-4 times a week, at the worse, it was 5-6 times a week. I went from liquor to beer and now I'm back to liquor. I very rarely drink socially, it's always by myself. I'm getting worried and scared for my health and my marriage but since I struggle with depression and anxiety,  drinking helps me to stop worrying, if only momentarily. I guess I'm really just posting to make myself somewhat accountable to start this journey and also to ask - How did you feel if you've experienced liver damage? How did you know? I'm one of those people that is scared of the knowing. Thank you all in advance!!

Turns out I should have given my friends more credit: I was expecting resistance but they have been nothing but supportive and now I’m more sure about where I stand with them.

I've been here before. 6 months sober. In January/February 2018 after one of my uncles passed away. I was spending lots of time with my immediate family, my nana and papa, mom, brother and other uncle. We were all trying to cope and be close and in that spending a lot of time drinking. My living uncle saw that both my brother and I were struggling with moderation and made us a bet that if we could stay sober for 6 months he would give us each 1000$. 

My s/o was to be my uncles source and rat me out if I drank and he was committed to that. My friends were all so supportive in me getting such a pay out. It was a big deal. It only got hard for me when the weather got nice. Longer days/nights spent with my favourite people boozing it up. My bet was up mid August that year. I got my 1000$ and went right beck to drinking. 

I did not earn that money.

Sometime through my bet I met a good friend for dinner after work. We were on a patio, the weather was beautiful. He ordered a drink and I clearly wanted one. He was like just have a drink ""I won't tell anybody"". I did without even a second thought. It was so sweet. This stayed just between us until August 2019. A full year later.

The immediate family I mentioned before went to visit my uncle in the new home he had recently purchased. Again we spent the whole time drinking. I blacked out the first night and was so embarrassed the next day. Despite my shame I continued to drink. As the night was winding down we were playing cards and someone had made a joke about how I cheated during my 6months. HOW DID THEY KNOW?! While I was blacked out I apparently ratted myself out. In my less drunk, now conscious state I felt absolutely destroyed. I got ""caught"" and I was contemplating why I had even done it. Was it really worth it? No. I immediately went into my bank app and transfered 1000$ out of my savings to send to my uncle because I did not earn that money. He refused saying ""just keep it and if I ever need it I'll hit you up"". That's the kind of person he is. 

This is not a self pity post. I'm still holding so much guilt about it and only have myself to blame. I know that my mom has pulled similar stunts in the past and has always leaned on them for money and I never wanted to be like that. 

I quit drinking after that weekend, 180 days ago. I don't know if that's worth sharing with my family. If they'll believe me or of I would just be setting them up for more disappointment or if they'll even care. I have no desire to drink again. Ever.",10

I’ve been getting bad news recently, but I haven’t drank, and my perspective shows it.","A little over a month ago, I quit drinking again as I had become beaten down physically and psychologically by alcohol despite my adamance to achieve proper moderation this time. In my first couple weeks of kicking the habit, I interviewed for 4 clinical psychology PhD programs. I felt great about the interviews, and was quite confident I would be offered admission into at least 2 schools that seemed to take a liking to me. 

A couple days after the last interview, I found out one of those programs wouldn’t be offering me admission. I was disappointed, but maintained confidence I would be receiving good news soon. I didn’t. One by one, I got the rejection emails. Some were more gently worded than others, but each stung progressively worse as my hope simultaneously diminished. 

My fiancée asked me after one or another of the emails came in if I was tempted to drink because of the news. I was utterly surprised that the notion hadn’t even crossed my mind until that moment, and even then it didn’t strike me as appealing in the slightest. 

Maybe it was my drinking days that rendered me unfit for these programs by dulling my wit or keeping me from gaining better experience, but that’s neither here nor there. Whatever the case may be, I’ve realized that in these rejections I have actually been offered an opportunity to open my mind to a new world of possibilities for my life. I honestly believe that this failure will nudge me closer to my proper trajectory, and I know if I were in my drinking mindset I would see this failure in a totally different light. I would see it as as damning; it would serve as evidence that I am worthless and would thus justify my self condemnation to a life of drunken misery. 

I didn’t realize how freeing sobriety really was until I reflected on the difference in my perspective. I’m no longer searching for reasons to be miserable, and I’m actually feeling tempered optimism in the face of adversity. It really feels good to feel like myself without alcohol compromising my judgment. IWNDWYT",19

Attended my first meeting last night and have mixed feelings about the whole thing. For starters I'm absolutely terrified of public speaking so I kept quiet and have a feeling I will for awhile in future meetings. I have to say though for the most part I found it pretty helpful. Listening to some people talk made me think about some behaviors that I didn't realize I was guilty of and gave me some ideas on how to deal with said behavior. 

I'm sure this has been discussed at great length here but I was curious if someone could give me the bullet points on the difference between SMART and AA?

Most importantly, I’ve addressed and finally worked through some really heavy stuff I was carrying around for a long time. I learned how to truly love myself instead of drowning my feelings. My anxiety and depression levels are the lowest they’ve ever been, I’ve healed relationships, and I feel lighter, brighter and more optimistic about the future than I ever have. 

As I stood in my kitchen looking at all that broken glass, I burst out laughing remembering the champagne shattering in the exact same place exactly a year ago. I’m so fucking grateful to be standing in this space and knowing how capable I am of cleaning up my messes. Sobriety’s been the best decision of my life I wouldn’t want it any other way.

I need to remind myself of my past drinking behaviour so that I don't minimise the effects and decide I can handle drinking again. This past week I've started to feel temptation. That voice creeping in ""well, you've done 3.5 months, so surely you can have the odd social drink and stop before getting drunk"" I actually think that I probably could do that initially. I've done it before. But inevitably that one or two drinks  at some point becomes 3 or 4 and then at 3 or 4 the alcohol takes over and its 10. 
Christmas eve 2018 is a very shameful date etched into my memory. After drinking loads of wine I blacked out. I woke up in hospital late the next day - Christmas day, to find my 22 year old son at my bedside. I have no recollection of taking a mixed overdose of very potent psychiatric medicines and sleeping tablets, my husband attempting to wake me after hearing my unusual breathing, wetting myself a couple of times,the ambulance coming, my son accompanying me to hospital and staying all night and all Christmas day by my side. I almost died. If my husband hadn't realised something was wrong then I'd be dead. If I had taken just a couple more tablets I'd be dead. My family may have thought I'd intended to kill myself. My 3 yr old daughter would have grown up without a mother and knowing I'd killed myself too probably It doesnt bear thinking about. When I woke, I tried to get out of bed and collapsed immediately. I had to stay in hospital another night and went home the following evening. I have a bit of memory of waking up every so often and being very confused and my son telling me I needed to stay in bed. The shame and guilt at the time was unreal. Its faded a little but I just can't believe I did that. I don't know what went through my brain before I took those tablets. I'll never know. My poor son!! Ugh
Anyway, i stopped drinking at that time but after 3 months i honestly thought i could drink the odd glass of wine. Stupid really since I've been a binge drinker since my teenage years and have plenty of evidence that i take it too far too often and end up behaving recklessly, irresponsibly, awfully. Nothing really trumps almost dying but honestly I've done some very stupid or embarrassing things etc. So, I drank responsibly - at first. Then I'd drink a bit more than I had planned and before I knew it I was back to binge town. 
The last time I drank, I blacked out (again) and did something stupid that I regretted. My husband told me that it reminded him of that Christmas and he was right. I was completely out of it. I couldn't remember chunks of time and wasn't in control at all. 
So, I've stopped once again. 
Not sure why I've written this stuff here, I suppose just to get it out there and as a reminder to myself and others that if we think we can't moderate or have a problem doing so. We're probably right.

My poo emotions are maxed out today. I made the mistake of getting into a relationship after a month of sobriety. It was a distraction from focusing on myself and I ignored instincts thinking they were incorrect due to my range of early sobriety emotions. 
After six months in I started going to meetings and found them helpful and grounding. They also helped me realize that the relationship I was in was going nowhere so I ended it. 
It’s my first sober breakup and I’m letting myself feel all the feels and it is hard! Even making the choice to end things because I knew it wasn’t good for me seemed impossible! Crying, feeling like I won’t find my person, hyper focused on my flaws and what I did wrong to push them away. All of it is too much. Except it isn’t. This is where I need to be right now and I won’t be numbing anything out with alcohol. 
Time to live and learn and go forward with a sober mind and sober emotions.  Now to get through the grieving phase with patience and grace. 
Thanks for reading and I wish all of you a grateful and sober day.

My longest streak was 90 days; on average I would make it a week and a half. I've come to understand my addiction much better as a result, and it seems like I feel the triggers coming before they arrive. I'm writing today just for my own accountability, but also maybe to let people know that relapsing doesn't mean total failure. 

When I'm home, I rarely feel temptation to drink, even though my husband keeps alcohol in the house. I just don't want it (despite my past of drinking myself to oblivion every night on the couch). The temptation always comes from social events where alcohol is present. 90% of my relapses began this way. I've been working very hard to manage the anxiety and fear that comes with sobriety in these situations, and I'm slowly getting better at it. 

I've learned to really pay attention to the anxiety as it creeps up early in the day, when I know I'm going out for dinner with friends. It's important for me not to ignore those feelings, because when I do, they gain power. Facing them head on allows me to dismantle them, reveal them for what they are. They tell me I can have a couple glasses of wine, that it will feel good and no one will notice I'm drinking again--it won't be a big deal. I remind myself of the million times I had just one glass of wine, and continued drinking all night alone until I cried myself into passing out. I remind myself of how I will probably need to call in sick the next day at work, or will waste the entire weekend recovering. I think of the yoga class and the gardening and the reading I won't be able to enjoy or get done. I think about my digestion, which is finally becoming normal again, having to restart--the cramps and nausea and diarrhea that last for weeks. And then there's the overwhelming, emotionally crippling regret and anxiety. 

Once I've dismantled the craving for what it is, I'm better prepared to face my friends and just ask for a sparkling water with ice. I remember everything I say, I'm in control, and I am, shockingly, pretty fun to be around. I make jokes, I laugh, I lose myself in these moments with friends. 

It's not easy--it's the hardest thing I've ever done, convincing myself over and over that alcohol is a poison that ruins my life. We are inundated with it, blinded by society and addiction. I am in awe of everyone here who is reaching for a better life. Thanks for reading.",46

So if you find it annoying or pointless, I apologize. While I can only hope it gives even one person an ounce of strength when they need it, if it only ends up serving as a way for me to get out what's running through my head, it's worth it for me.

Today is my birthday, which historically I've never been a fan of celebrating. To be honest, even acknowledging that right now fills me with a random, unexplainable uneasiness. Especially after the past year, which I can say without a doubt has been the worst of my life, it seemed even less appealing than usual. I felt, and still often feel, more embarrassed and ashamed of myself this past year than ever before in my life. 

Being sent to jail, a place I never even considered a possibility I'd end up. Over something I did that I still struggle believing I can find a way to forgive myself for. Getting divorced from a woman that I know I love from the bottom of my heart because became a monster to her as my addiction grew stronger and stronger. Having to work to obtain as much visitation as possible with my kids that I had previously spent every day with since they were born. Coming to the realization I wasn't the great father I made myself out to be over the past few years. That my wife has always and will always deserve a better partner than I was to her. Most of all, wondering if no matter how much I fix, change, or do right for the rest of my life, I'll ever feel like I'm a good person again.

I'm explaining all of that for two reasons.

The first reason is, on a day I have always opposed even acknowledging, let alone actively celebrating, alcohol had so much power over me that I'd have no issue overcoming how I felt if it meant I could use it to justify ""guilt-free drinking"". Getting as drunk as humanly possible was ok this one night. I wouldn't even have to try hiding my slurred speech like I do every other night. Plus, the next day I wouldn't have to feel the familiar, horrible guilt when I wake up from overdoing it or blacking out. It was my birthday. It was acceptable this time. That's been my personal tradition for years.
 
Which brings me to the second reason I explained some of my backstory for this post. Because this birthday is different from the past five or six that I can't remember. Things in my life aren't magically fixed. No, I'm still not crazy about celebrating my birthday, but I am beyond ecstatic to celebrate that it's also my one month mark. I know it's a tiny accomplishment to some here, but it was also seemingly unfathomable to me 31 days ago. It's not the first time I've made efforts to quit over the past decade of drinking heavily. It is, however, the most completely focused, committed, and confident I've ever felt making this change. No matter how I feel about the mistakes I've made, and regardless of any bargains or excuses I've traditionally made on this day. I didn't drink for the past 30 days, and no matter what today is, IWNDWYT.

To me it’s a shameful word that creates a stigma and separation for alcohol consumption. To me the word creates a visual of someone who is in a ditch and can’t control their life because of alcohol use. That may be the case for some, but alcohol is can be an addictive substance for anyone - we are all susceptible. The only reason that I see it being beneficial is to remind someone that they can’t drink - but it also reminds them that they are somehow ‘different’ and something is wrong with them.

Personally I don’t want to tell people that I don’t drink because of the perception that I’m an alcoholic and I have a problem. That’s not the case - I’m just healthier physically, mentally, and spiritually without alcohol. I think AA is great except this one thing that seems to take sobriety as something that is driven by shame initially rather than power. I see a lot of newly sober people struggle with the label and some just go back to drinking because of it.

Some people have mentioned that admitting that you are an alcoholic is freeing - I dont get it though.  Can someone ELI5 the label ‘alcoholic”?",3

I'm in my mid-20s and struggle with moderating my drinking. I smoked weed heavily from early high school to my third year of college until I stopped after having a panic attack brought on by smoking and thinking I was dying from a heart attack. I developed pretty serious hypochondria after that incident and started to believe every moment of discomfort in my stomach, chest, etc. was a symptom of a fatal condition (the ""impending doom"" feeling) even after being told by multiple doctors that everything was fine with my health.

Quitting smoking cold turkey after getting high multiple times a day for years, I began substituting alcohol for marijuana. I had been a semi-heavy drinker before I quit weed, drinking both liquor and beer in excess in social situations, but once I no longer had weed in my life I began compensating with alcohol and was blacking out, drinking alone, and in general using it much more than I ever had before and certainly at an unhealthy level. This led to a near drowning in an icy river during my senior year and, while I still functioned and graduated, increased strain on my romantic and social relationships with girlfriends and friends who were simply tired of dealing with me and my habits while drunk.

After college (I'm 24 now) I moved for work to a city where I didn't know anyone and thus out of both boredom and loneliness continued the habit of drinking alone. The amount and frequency vary. At worst it has been nearly a fifth (750 ml) in one or two nights and at best it's one drink before dinner or a couple of beers. I do have nights of sobriety (I recently went two weeks with no booze) but more often than not I end up drinking more than I had told myself I would or wanted to. This often results in my hypochondria flaring up the next morning when I'm hungover to the point where I feel that same impending doom and as though I've damaged my body irrepairably and am doomed to liver failure or other drinking-related ailments. 

About a year and a half ago I went to the ER because of these feelings, thinking I had stomach cancer or pancreatitis or something of the like, and was once again told after tests that everything was fine and the symptoms were all psychosomatic. I haven't been since then but I routinely go through the same mental course the morning after drinking too much, constantly going back and forth between telling myself that everything is fine and I'm being paranoid and that this was the final straw and I've finally compromised my body and health. 

For all of these reasons and more I know the best thing to do would be to stop drinking altogether. I don't want to spend money on booze, let alone ER visits, and the bouts of hypochondria (which these days only occur after drinking) are truly insufferable. (I've been experiencing one this morning after drinking too much last night and reading this thread has helped a lot.) I have told myself I would stop drinking, at the very least stop buying alcohol to have in my apartment, many times, and while I sometimes stick to it for a bit, I always get to a point where I feel completely in control and healthy about my consumption and then end up getting back to this same point. It's a vicious cycle.

I think there are many reasons why cutting drinking out altogether is hard for me. There are social pressures as a young person living in a city, of course, but given that I spend a good deal of my time alone or with people who drink very little, it's not really a question of feeling pressured by others to drink. Part of it is the loneliness/lack of involvement and drinking just to have something to do as opposed to drinking to forget trauma or hardship. Another part of it is that I grew up with heavy-drinking parents for whom alcohol was a constant. I also went through high school and college reading classic American authors (like Hemingway and Fitzgerald) and as such I think I've internalized drinking as part of my masculinity and identity as someone who wants to be mature and cultured. 

I think all the time about maintaining a habit of one drink a day at most and how great that self-control sounds, but clearly I'm mostly incapable of doing that. I am truly tired of the hangovers and episodic anxiety about my health, and I know that I feel my best, mentally and physically, during extended periods of sobriety such as that two-week stretch earlier this month. I've always shied away from getting professional help for the issue, largely because I feel ashamed to not be in control of my habits and to be struggling with this issue at such a young age compared to some lifelong drinkers. But I'm hoping that writing this post to all you strangers might be a step in that direction. Please feel free to share your stories, experiences with similar feelings of anxiety or frustration, or whatever else comes to mind. It always helps to feel less alone in this struggle. Thank you.",8

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thinking of ""happy, joyous and free"" wasn't enough to keep me permanently happy throughout the day, but boy, did I feel free when I didn't have to compound my problems and make them any worse. In order to maintain my sobriety, I have to be mindful of my attitude and take direct mental steps to use tools I have acquired over this time. One tool I used yesterday was meditation- just took 10 minutes and turned on my Calm app. It allowed me to slow down after a busy day at work, to just focus on breathing, and to release my shoulders just a quarter inch lower. Plus, the dogs like it when I quiet down. :) What's one tool in your toolkit you use? Seems like we have a lot of newcomers on board (HI, YOU AWESOME PEOPLE) so why don't we share what's working?

Last time I was on here my life was so different. My husband, 57 y/o, went out for a run with a dear friend on Sept 10, had a heart attack and never came back. I managed to stay sober for 5 weeks and then all went to hell. I have bi-polar disorder as well and the stress of dealing with the aftermath sent me manic (including a stint in the psych ward over NY) and I am literally just coming down. My last drink was Monday morning about 4 am. I made my decision at that time that I'm not going to create my new life based on alcohol.

Everything has changed. My daughter moved out (as planned) with her two dogs and cat, so It is just me and my 14 year old lovely dachshund. My pal, but he is old and sick and it won't be long for him either. My sons do not not live nearby but are in contact regularly, but it's not the same. I am choosing, however, to go forward and create my best life. One day at a time. The ONLY way is sans alcohol. Don't need it. Don't want it. Onward. Peace and Bless, all.",31

In the afternoons and evenings I get the strongest cravings for alcohol. That’s when the little voice in my head urges me to ‘go on, just get one drink’ or ‘just buy a bottle of vodka, you’ll drink it moderately this time’ (I won’t, I’ll drink it til I blackout or it’s gone).

What are some strategies you all use to get through those few hours before bed?",13

I relapsed after a year back in October over going through a tumultuous divorce and I haven't seemed to be able to get my footing back since. The longest I've gone since then has been a month. The situation with my ex is ongoing and we are stuck in some sort of limbo that is really hard to describe. He tells me he wants to come back to me, but he won't until he sees i can stay sober again. We have a young daughter together who I have let him have during this so I know that she is in a healthy environment, but being without her is extremely hard. Today has just been rough. It's been one of those days where I woke up and wanted to drink, and then i got mad at myself for even thinking that. Because the WHOLE reason i am in this situation is because i can't stay sober. If i just get sober I'll get my life back. My husband, my child. Why the hell is that so hard for me to understand? I know its because of addiction but i hate it. I know that might sound childish but I fucking hate addiction and what it does to people. I was once a healthy, lively, smart, caring girl. And I've gone so far down this fucking nightmare rabbit hole that I dont know who I am anymore. Today was a perfect day to drink. But. IWNDWYT.",19

Even though my girl still drinks she's been an amazing source of support and encouragement for me throughout all of this. She's seen me at my absolute worst and she stuck around, she believes in me fully and she's been nothing but incredible in helping me through this.

But she left Monday morning for a girls trip and will be gone until Friday.  Now I have three days off of work, a house full of booze, and absolutely nobody to keep me accountable. The trash even goes out before she gets back, so the evidence would be easy to dispose of.

I have no reason to drink. I'm feeling accomplished, I'm doing great at work, I'm getting more done around the house, I'm reinvested back into healthy hobbies I had neglected, our relationship has improved, I spend more time with family, I'm working out again and I feel healthier than I've felt since I was a teenager.

And honestly, it scares the living shit out of me.

The beginning was easy for me after the first few days when the shakes and sweats finally went away. It's been easy to just go about my day and feel good about what I was doing. I think some call it the ""pink cloud."" Now, for the first time since quitting, I'm finding my myself negotiating with myself and I have to actively think about it and stop. I'm finding myself truly having to say ""I will not drink today,"" and not just as a mantra or catchphrase or whatever, but as me making a conscious and active decision. I have to remind myself to play the tape forward and see what happens when I go down that dark path, and make the choice to go then other way.

I'm going to stay strong, I'm going to be okay, because I know where drinking takes me and that's not somewhere I ever want to be again. I just really needed to talk about it and I know you all would understand .",12

I'll probably have to force myself at some point to start trying new things or creating better routines but I feel like the rest of today will be a write off. 

It's kind of depressing though because I haven't really done anything today. I messaged my gym to say I can't go anymore (it wasn't working out for me, got to find a new one), had a house inspection, went for a big long walk, got some food to binge on, watched a movie, and now I'm here. It's 4:22 pm in the afternoon. Urges to drink are coming and going. I'm reading every new post that's submitted here though, that's helpful.

There are several areas of my life I knew this was likely to impact, but I struggled to muster the willpower.

I have been without alcohol or weed for 8 days now, and here’s what I’ve noticed has improved. Granted, I was not an alcoholic in the sense that I experienced withdrawals, but I did self-medicate with alcohol and weed most days for depression, anxiety, and to cope with the frustration of living with psoriasis.

1. My psoriasis has reduced in severity.
2. I have more money.
3. I have the energy to work more. 
4. I have the energy and motivation to exercise.
5. I have the energy and motivation to get things done around the house.
6. My thinking is clearer. I have made progress thinking through areas of my life I want to improve but have been stuck for quite some time.
7. My working memory has improved - I can remember and track things I need to do much better.
8. My ability to be present and my best at work has greatly increased.
9. I have a newfound sense of discipline which translates into pride and self-esteem gains.
10. Cravings reduce by the day. 
11. My new relationship is flourishing. 

I was lucky enough to have met a wonderful woman, who happens to abstain from substances. We have connected very deeply in every area of our life, but it became clear that me using substances was a deal breaker for her. I told her that I had wanted to experiment with quitting for a while, and that this would be a good time for me to try. She offered to be a support to me, and honestly replacing my self-medicating with the more healthy happy-chemicals has helped make it easier. 

What this means to me is that to be successful you need to replace your substance abuse with a better habit that provides value to your life. Working out, a new hobby, reconnecting socially, etc. This makes it so much easier to continue to enjoy life even when you crave a drink or a joint. I’m lucky that my support happens to be my girlfriend, but it’s also important to spend time with sober people while you go through this transition. Find someone who is sober and pick up a new hobby with them. You can do this and you will feel better for doing it.",10

This lead to difficulty handling expectations put on me growing up, as well as difficulty socialising. I've always wished for a normal romance since I was 11, but it never came. One rejection after
another, first dates that never amounted to anything. Other slight mental issues leading to slight difficulties everywhere in my life, which I could not handle properly, leading to depression. I started binge drinking at 26, left many of my old
social circles. I'd given up on improving my life. I knew I was going to die sad and alone, so why not YOLO. I stopped taking care of myself and saving money. Each year, the kindlings got worse. Yesterday I was at another day 5, and I was sure I would be finished from my heart popping out and all the paranoia and psychosis.

Last saturday, I was set up on a date. Going in, I had no expectations. I've never had a girl look at me like that before. The first time someone agreed to a second date. For the first time, I have something worth stopping for.

I don't know what to do. I'm in no condition to treat women the way they deserve to be treated. No real net value, no car. I'm frightened that she'll find out what I am. Even if she doesn't, I'm afraid that I might not cut it out for her in the long run. Then it'll be back to the bottle to numb out the pain of depression and nihilism. Many here here seem to have something that keeps them from relapsing or spiraling out of control. I would like to hear from those who don't.",4

When I first started trying to seriously quit around this time last year, it was so much more panicked. I was fearful of the unknown, scared of not being able to access liquor, etc. But this time around, I know I’ve made it through soooo many first steps already. I’ve gone days and weeks sober, no problem. I know I’ve been able to get to sleep at night without booze. I’ve shown myself I can be social without liquid courage, and have dated and made new friends in the process. 

I’m not saying it’s everything, and I’m not saying I’m not still struggling to catch myself and take precautions. But I can tell there’s a noticeable difference in my approach. I have more confidence because I’ve done this before and have been successful. I can be successful again. Even if I knock myself down, I know I’m able to get back up and try again.

Carnaval it’s over and I’m still sober!!!,"A little context: Carnaval is a four day holiday in Brazil where we usually drink and party on the streets. It’s basically the best time of the year for brazilians because we can go out on the streets wearing nothing but swimsuits/costumes and glitter or just relax at home.

Since it’s an event that basically revolves around drinking and getting drunk I was really worried that I would fall off the wagon. But that didn’t happen! I packed up my cooler with non alcoholic beer and partied for three of the four days, only missing one because of the rain, and I’m SO proud of myself!

I actually considered stopping only after this carnaval, but many events made me stop more than 130 days ago, and I don’t regret one bit. This showed me I can have fun, laugh, dance and talk without alcohol. And I can guarantee that no drunk carnaval nights would be better than this feeling of being proud of myself.

We also say that the year only starts after Carnaval, and I can safely say that my year is heading to a great, sober, start.

For anyone needing strength, we can do this, we can be better. We can still have fun, laugh, stay up all night, dance, make friends and many more things sober. Being sober makes us happier, not just by being sober, but by trying to be better and to deal with the problems that made us drink in the first place, I am doing this, so can all of you! I’m so happy right now and this subreddit has been a great help in my journey and I hope that someday I can give back some that was given to me.

For instance, I will do all of my laundry, clean my apartment, do my budgeting, etc. while having drinks. It's almost become something I look forward to. However, In the last couple months I have been trying to stop drinking and continue to fail. One of my big struggles is having the motivation to do anything while sober. The most sobriety I've achieved is about 5 days but literally through the whole time I am just sitting on my couch watching TV not wanting to do anything... to the point where it almost seems like I would be happier dying 20 years earlier in exchange for having the motivation to do something instead of just sitting here terribly unhappy. What I'm wondering is if anyone else has dealt with this in the beginning and if so, how the hell did you get through it? Does it get better or do I just have to accept that life seems empty from here on out?  I should also note that I have had  a neurological issue that causes fatigue and pain pretty quickly, this was before the drinking began. So replacing the drinking with exercise, or what many people do isn't really an option for me.  Thanks to everyone in advance for your time.

Each time I come back things have gradually gotten worse.
It makes me crazy, on the brink of madness as to why I’m here again. It feels like I’ve got no clear understanding of myself, no willpower, no hope.
I’m 34, unemployed, very nearly single and certainly more isolated than I’ve ever been. It’s been 14 hours since my last drink and I’m curled up on my bed under a blanket. My palms and feet are sweating, my mind is racing and my stomach is in knots. My anxiety is all consuming and it feels like it will never leave. 
It feels too late... too much damage has been done. 
Everyone around me is frustrated that I just won’t stop, I’m the only drinker in my world.
My social anxiety stops me from being able to walk through the door into AA. My alcoholic brain keeps convincing me time and time again that I CAN and WILL control what I drink. The Australian drinking culture makes it even harder for people to take my cries for help seriously, it’s not considered a problem to drink a lot of beer, it’s like water right?! Wrong... Water wouldn’t be able to wreak so much havoc, water wouldn’t make me hate myself with such a passion, Water wouldn’t take life, in fact water can give life. So many thoughts and feelings all at once. I know I just need to stop, knowing what I NEED to do has never been the issue. I hate this disease. I mourn for the wasted time.... being wasted. 
But I’m going to throw whatever is left in me at sobriety, one more time.

I stopped because of my first episode of anxiety as a withdrawal symptom I've never felt before. Now I'm feeling restless, slightly anxious again. Will it go away?","Let it also be known I haven't had tobacco in two months and full on no nicotine (did Velo, the nicotine pouches) for three weeks.  Yeah, quitting two things at once is fucking hard.... but not impossible.  Also got prescribed Wellbutrin.

So... never much of a liquor drinker, beer 99% of the time.  I'm pretty healthy, methinks.  Blood draw last year came out within normal ranges for everything.  I'm due again soon.

I've been on and off drinking since I was 21 (I'm in my mid 30s), but never more than socially until a part of my life three years ago.   I like craft beer.  I don't aim to get drunk but sometimes it happened.  I started drinking 3-6 nights a week, and over the last year almost every day.  Sometimes a few beers, sometimes a twelve pack.  It felt good to get up in the morning a little hungover and put one foot in front of the other.  But I drank for reasons, like we all did.  I didn't drink to get shitfaced.  Just preoccupied with thoughts and depression.

I experienced some of ""the fear"" anxiety, the impending doom type.  It was crazy.  I'm a decorated soldier, saw death before my very eyes in my time in service - nothing, and I mean NOTHING has ever come close to this ""fear"" alcoholics describe.  It was scary.  My skin and scalp were tingly.  I was vitamin B deficient, too.  The next day at work I started freaking out internally, and I quietly left and told my leadership I had a medical issue that needed attention.

I went to the ER - indeed, I was suffering from withdrawal but I wasn't a straight up shitfaced-every-day drinker, and I wasn't in a seizure scenario since this was day 2 of sobriety at this point... I rarely got shitfaced drunk, but I did binge when I shouldn't have... Anyway,  they gave me an IV with the good stuff, five days of librium taper, and sent me on my way.  It worked.  In the ER, when that IV hit, the anxiety was gone.  The first week of librium taper... anxiety was gone.  I think this was the slap in the face I needed because I've read some of your stories and stories from other subs and I am tame in comparison.

I don't want to continue drinking just so I don't feel the fear or anxiety.  I want to adjust to life without alcohol...

Living each day normally... but I'm starting week 3.  I'm restless, adjusting to life without the bottle.  A little bit anxious.  A minor version of this ""fear"" anxiety.  I just want to feel normal without this shit hitting me at random times of the day.

&#x200B;

tl;dr -  Moderate light-to-binge drinker, got heavier over last year, started experiencing anxiety at a random time after drinking a day or two before, starting feeling tingling in scalp, self-admitted ER detox visit and prescribed librium, made it through two whole weeks and starting to feel anxiety again, got prescribed Wellbutrin a few days after ER visit.  Wondering when this'll all stop.

Also, I've started taking vitamin B complex twice a day, it's helped with a lot of other stuff, too.

I have decided to stop drinking. I've never really enjoyed drinking, and sparsely do it maybe once every 1-2 weeks. However, I am a very annoying drunk, or at least I personally believe I am.  Also, while I'm able to moderate pretty well, sometimes I lose track and can easily get grossly intoxicated given my low tolerance. I probably don't need to tell anyone here about how bad hangovers become in your late 20's either.

I kind of asked myself the most obvious question: why do I even drink lol? I don't like it in any way shape or form. I like having my mind sharp at all times, like being my happy/confident self (me before 3 beers), and never having to worry about taking a Sunday away from personal projects (software dev) or knowing I'm about to feel like a sardine. It just doesn't make sense.

So I'm all for this change, and the many benefits, but I'm worried about losing my social life. I know several friends will probably want to go do their own thing, and I'm ok with that. However, I like my social life and the things we do, even excluding the drinking.

My concern is that this might change. I'm also concerned about my dating life as well.

Does anyone here have a similar situation? Were you able to either keep your previous social life or potentially create an even better hybrid one? Were you possibly able to find new people compatible with the humor, lifestyle, and likeness as your previous friends? I love my friends, I just want to stop drinking because I don't like it.",2

It had been from posting stuff on social media, saying I was going to harm myself(the truth was I was just trolling and being drunk and stupid)

Next thing I know, police officers bang at the door and evaluate me. The exchange is a bit of a blur because I was drunk but I was very calm and non-resistant. I told them I posted something online that said I was going to do self-harm, they decide to take me to the ER to be transferred over to the psych ward for a 72 hour hold. I stay at the ER for several hours(possibly because they wanted to get my blood alcohol level down before they transferred me over to my room). 

I get to the psych ward and its my first time there. I am beyond scared. I get forced to take a small dose of a drug called Atavan(sp) to help lower blood pressure and calm me down. I end up staying at the place for 3 days and while I'm there, I think about how I ended up in a place like that. I end up at the very least, making new friends with some of the patients, I learn how to play board games I haven't tried in years, and I try to make my time there count. I take advantage of the group therapy session which unfortunately wasn't offered everyday(at least wasn't offered on the weekends anyway) and I do pretty much whatever the nurses ask of me so I don't make any trouble. 

After three days, I finally get released and boy, I could taste the freedom! I has never known such a wonderful feeling since I've never been involuntarily taken away and locked up. I take a really nice hot shower for like 30 minutes and reflect on what I'm going to do to better myself. 

The first thing I tell myself to eliminate is alcohol. It's what put me there in the first place. So today, I start a new chapter in my life and I will come here everyday to the support of others and hope to find ways to repair and heal my life again. I'm excited for what this new change will do for me and I thank everyone for reading this post.",27

Sometimes I find that in real life, there isn’t always someone around who fully appreciates the little things that give us pause and make us realize “wow, I DID that!”, so I thought I would make a thread for anyone who might want or need a high five today on the little (or big) things that mean a lot to us, but kind of go unnoticed or unappreciated in our day-to-day lives. 

Here are a couple things I am proud of; please feel free to share yours if you would like!

- I am over 400 days sober, which in hindsight, feels impossible. I remember at the beginning not being able to wait until I saw numbers like that, and now it feels strange that it was ever a hard thing to accomplish. I barely think about drinking anymore, and THAT seems impossible.

- My lower back has been in pain for years, and I have finally been getting help for it. A couple of weeks ago I was able to do 5 leg raises in a row, and it has been years since I could do that without my back feeling like it was about to explode. During my last training session, I did over 20, and I wanted to cry with joy (and the relief of being pain-free)

- I have been learning Muay Thai and boxing for the last 8-ish months, and just in the past couple of weeks I feel like I’ve hit a major turning point; I don’t feel as much like a beginner anymore, and am starting to feel like I am getting the hang of it. My trainer took a video of us doing a certain combo a couple of months ago, and then another one last week, and I can’t stop watching it, because I can see so much improvement in my technique and form. I am starting to look like a real fighter, and I just can’t imagine my life taking this kind of direction. Back when I used to drink, I had sort of given up on the idea of doing anything physical with my life; when I was young I was an athlete, but as I grew older and lazier I just assumed that that part of my life was over. I could never have imagined myself becoming a boxer or Muay Thai fighter; as I am writing this, I am almost overcome with gratitude for this wonderful second chance.

So, anyway, thanks for listening, and thank you in advance to anyone who may want to share what they’re proud of. I’d love to hear from you!

Possible trigger warning.,"This shit is a lot harder this time around. Last yr at this time I turned in my older brother for the yrs and yrs of sexual abuse I endured. He was a correctional officer at a prison in CA. Both my parents are ex law enforcement and decided to back him. Even tho I told them about the abuse and they knew 15 yrs ago. Older bro grew up and had my nieces (I was so upset I couldn't even bring myself to meet her for 9 months)when he was 30 ish. The last time he raped me I was 19(6 months before I found out he was having his first daughter) Before that I was 13. I realized I needed to get sober so that I could be there for them (my older brothers kids)in the event that I needed to protect them. So I got sober. I've remained sober for those kids all this time. 
When I realized something bad was happening I told my parents something was wrong, they agreed and also agreed to intervene. At this time I never wanted to have to blow everything up and go to the cops. Especially what it would do to my family. I just wanted him and his kids in therapy, for him to get meds and stop drinking (he's also a drunk)I was effectively conditioned all my life and I just broke that conditioning when I realized my parents were gas lighting me at the kids expense to save their image.

I turned my older brother in the next day. He's currently looking at  life in prison. 21 counts. Including torture, kidnapping,continuous sexual abuse of a child, sodomy, incest etc. The preliminary is over and it's moving forward. I'm ok with all this. There's been multiple other ppl to come forward some are men now, that have similar stories to mine The part that hurts and why I started drinking again is my family. My sobriety hinged on them. I created a life where I was always there for them in any case. Since I've turned in my older brother they have completely cut me off. Everybody. My mom and dad all my little brothers. My grandma.... All the ppl I built myself up around to love and take care of are gone. The worst part is they're keeping me away from the kids I set out to protect. I haven't seen anybody except in court for going on a yr. They haven't talked to me. Nothing. I've been outcasted. They operate like a cult. You go against them you're out.. The love was always conditional. 

It took me 4 months to relapse after I turned him in. I drank a few days a week for about 3 more months which turned to every night. I blacked out and did some dumb shit 3 weeks ago so I cut myself off. But besides HALT. (Hungry, angry, lonely, tired) nothing else from AA helps me. 

Ik everybody in AA and I swear its only ppl that have to be there. Nobody is there out of free will. Also the twelve steps are based on god and I don't believe in God or the Bible. I need help to cope. I'm in therapy and on meds. I work out, have a good sleep cycle, I have a ton of hobbies but this thirst. I haven't felt this since I was a in my early 20s before I quit drinking and it stuck, I tried several times, but always relapsed after 6-8 months. 

I have to be ok.  I have to make it thru this. Failure is not an option, I have to be here for those kids when they're grown or when this is all over.. 

I'm looking for advice or maybe just ppl to talk to that get this feeling.",16

I just decided to stop smoking too and holy shit. The nicotine withdrawals are SO much worse than the drinking withdrawals were. When I've stopped smoking in the past, I was always still drinking, so I think I never noticed the nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

I really *really* don't want to start drinking again. That is priority number 1. But I was starting to have heart trouble from the smoking (and years of drinking, no doubt) so I feel compelled to stop smoking as well. I know drinking would take these withdrawals away immediately, but that's not an option for me.

But this last friday i fucked up bad. I met up with a friend, went to some guys place to drink vodka. There were some people there already and we sat down. My mate had to go somewhere right away so i was there alone and some of the people started picking on me and mocking me... as far as i remember, i took it well and went out when my mate got back. I was driven home by cops which isn´t exactly normal but not too strange where i live. My friend spent the night at his friends, where we started the ""party"". Anyway... next day i get a call and turns out i waved a knife around and fought with someone and who the fuck knows what else.

I´m fucking terrified at the moment. Since noone got hurt, i guess i´m alright. But the thing is.

I’ve been having a really tough time with life in general for the last year. First I had a miserable job, and then I lost that job in the fall. I’ve been unemployed for months, cashed out all of my retirement funds to pay bills, and my wife and I have been arguing all the time. 

I turned to drinking heavily as a way to cope with things. All I succeeded in doing was scaring my wife and kids, making them think I had a medical condition unrelated to my drinking. 

Last night I ended up in the ER after I binged what much have been 10-12 shots of vodka in about two hours. Then I fell over, hit my head, and bruised myself up pretty badly. 

I lied and said I hadn’t been drinking. Ended up having blood work done and was told my BAC was 3x the legal limit. My kids spent the night with their grandparents. The doctor came in to talk to me and I lied that I hadn’t been drinking for some reason. 

My wife almost left me last night. She almost called the cops to have me removed. 

I spent two hours last night talking to a crisis therapist by text.l because I couldn’t get in touch with mine. 

I’m heading down to a mental health hospital to be seen and make sure I’m not going to stroke out when the inevitable withdraws come. I’m scared shitless at the moment not know what’s going to happen. I’ve driven people away and don’t know if some relationships can be prepared. 

I just want to get better. I’m tired of the addiction, the kids, and the deceit. I want to go back to the way I used to be, or at least become a better version of who I am today.

(+ alcohol & weight side question),"Hello all! This is my first post here, as I'm usually just a lurker. I've been trying to reach out to people in my life about my drinking but I feel like no one takes me seriously or they tell me they don't think I drink enough to be an alcoholic

**Main issue:**

Me and my SO both drink. He drinks about 2-4 beers on an average day . Mine has recently increased from about half a pint to a pint of gin a night, and I'm already feeling sick and a little shaky in the mornings. Every morning I wake up wanting to quit because I feel awful, and then evening comes and I'm back at it (I don't usually drink in the daytime). I tell myself I'll just have one, but we all know how that goes. This morning I feel especially awful and thought that maybe this sub could help motivate me

However, the biggest issue for me is that I want to stop drinking and my SO wants to stop smoking cigarettes (which we both also do). I feel that my drinking is a  much bigger issue and that if I could kick it I could quite easily quit cigarettes too. So, I want to start tackling the drinking first.

Since he doesn't usually seem to have any want to stop drinking (or he does very momentarily), I obviously have a hard time trying to stop. If he tries with me, we'll be good for a couple days and then he brings home beer and I end up having one too.

Has anyone had any experience with this? I've tried many times to ask him to quit with me and it never works. He doesn't make much of an effort and ends up bringing home a case of beer within days, to which I also end up having beer (even though I don't really like it). We're both quite unmotivated and don't do much other than gamer stuff. Of course I will try again, but I'm just looking for some tips on how to avoid drinking when you're around it often (I work from home so it's around all day, although I usually only have 0-2 drinks in the afternoons).

**Side question**:

Has anyone who has successfully quit drinking lost weight after doing so? I suddenly gained a significant amount of weight a few years ago (1-2 years after starting to drink daily) and am having an impossible time trying to lose it because most of my calories come from alcohol (which delays any fat burning). Exercising etc has only made me sore all over and hasn't helped anything. I'm making losing weight one of my motivators for quitting so would love to hear some success stories!

I love waking up on Sundays with no regret and feeling like I have a full day ahead of me.  But man, it's amazing how I'm triggered every Saturday (and plenty of other days too).  I have realized all the dumb reasons I've convinced myself to drink for no reason in the past.  I have had to say ""not in the next 10 minutes"" as opposed to ""not today"" many times.  

The biggest challenge so far was a group dinner and concert (I skipped the concert) with college friends.  This is a group of guys and their wives, and we always drink together.  I've never been around them without drinking.  I was nervous enough about this that I thought about not going, and I also thought ""Why don't I just have a couple so I don't have to deal with the questions?"".  I was strong enough to tell myself to own it.  If someone doesn't like it, screw them.  And it helped to realize I didn't actually want to drink.  It was just that little voice trying to convince me it would make things easier.  I was able to tell myself that doing something I don't want to do, just because others expect it from me, is really stupid.  It went well.  A couple guys asked me questions about it and a couple others looked disapprovingly at me.  It may have helped that their wives were there, but I was true to myself and didn't give a shit what they thought.  It felt good.  

Upcoming challenge #1.  Guys weekend with most of the same group.  This is a tradition and is basically a drunk fest.  I'm sure that I don't want to drink, but I'm back to questioning whether or not I should go.  

Challenge #2.  I haven't been completely forthcoming with my wife.  She knows I'm not drinking and supports me.  But I haven't shared to what extent I have struggled with alcohol.  She wouldn't think I have a problem, so she has probably chalked this up as a phase and an attempt to lose some weight, be strict about things, etc.  This is all on me since it was easier to give that impression when I started, probably as a subconscious defense in case I didn't stick with it.  Time to open up.  Not my strong suit.  

Thanks to all who post here and encourage each other.  It's really amazing.  And thanks for reading if you got this far.  I was really trying to be brief, but I guess I have a lot to say!",7

I got DUI in 2011, so I still need to do a number of things before I get my license back (have an Ignition lock installed, take a driving test, etc.) Problem is, I want to get it all done NOW. I’m feeling pretty anxious and overwhelmed so I’m going to try to remind myself to focus on doing one thing at a time. So here is a short list of things I have been able to do since I quit drinking:

-Left a terrible marriage 

-Gotten my own apartment, by myself 

-Manage my bills (again, by myself) well enough to keep current, decrease debt dramatically and maintain a very good credit score (I had literally zero credit when I was drinking)

-Maintain a healthy and flourishing relationship with a great man who loves and respects me as much as I love and respect him

-Vastly improve my physical and mental health 

I still have bad days, but nothing compared to the hell I was in when I was drinking. I really have accomplished quite a bit, even though sometimes it doesn’t feel that way. Of course, there’s always room for improvement, and nothing will ever be perfect. But now that I’m sober, I have hope. 

I just have to remember to be patient.",8

They seemed to get stronger the more times I nodded off, awoke from a zap, and started to drift again. This was combined by an “awake dreaming” stint as well. I’d start to fall asleep, get a zap that startled me, but didn’t jolt me awake. As I recognized the zap, I’d start “dreaming” all kinds of things and it almost seemed like a hallucination. Inanimate objects were moving, morphing shapes, changing colors. Thinking about it this morning and can’t really tell if this was actual sleep-dreaming or just my mind playing tricks on me as a was dozing off. It felt like it went on for half an hour.

Yeah, 100 days isn't nearly as long as so many of you, but its been enough to get me to realize this is a life I want to continue living. Thanks to everyone here for their stories and their encouragement, this is always such an inspiring sub to read through!

Things I’ve noticed since stopping:

* My anxiety is melting away
* My brain feels calm all the time
* I’m saving money
* No hangovers…aka no Sundays where I don’t come out of my room because I’m so hungover
* My body overall feels better
* My skin looks good
* I have so much energy! This past weekend I went to 3 concerts. Had I drank at the first one…I wouldn’t have made it to the second and probably would’ve been miserable during the third
* I feel confident that I can go to a party/work event and have a great time 
* I no longer have brain fog during the week
* No one has pressured me to drink, if anything people tell me that they wish they could stop too
* I don’t feel scared about the awful possibilities of what could happen during a day/night full of drinking
* I’m getting good nights sleeps
* I’m way more productive at home and work
* I can make plans for the day after going out with no fear of being hungover

And at the risk of sounding overly dramatic, I feel FREE. Before, I felt like I was chained to alcohol. I couldn’t have fun without it. I couldn’t celebrate anything without it. Well, I now know that’s not true. I've learned I really prefer myself in each and every situation sober…took a long time to realize this but its true.

Two anecdotes: 

1. I was worried that my boyfriend (who is definitely a heavy drinker on the weekends) would be supportive of my sobriety during the time I was taking the medication (because how could he not be?) but might start to get whiney and annoyed when I continued not drinking even when the meds were done. Well…he pulled me aside the other day to tell me he really admires my sobriety, appreciates how I’ve handled it, thanked me for not ever getting preachy on him to stop, and that he wants to become sober one day too.
2. Some friends of mine pulled me aside to tell me that they can clearly see I’m thriving while being sober. They’ve noticed an upward trend in my mood and energy levels since stopping (I don’t think I was ever in bad moods around them…but I think I’m just happier and more energetic all the time now). 

Moral of the story? Not drinking has been a really great gift. I wish I had learned this 10+ years ago. IWNDWYT.",32

I figured I would take this opportunity to post, see my flair as a reminder, and pat myself on my back for how much I’ve changed - for the better - already.

Yesterday, my wife and I welcomed our second son into this world - our first turns 3 in June - and I can’t help but be overcome with happiness knowing that I’ve made the decision to stop drinking while they are young so they can grow up with a present father who prioritizes family over drinking.

I was in a very bad place for a very long time, and it took my wife to put things in perspective to make me actually do this. She has been the best support I’ve had and she’s truly saved my life.

For those lurking (I was one as well) everybody has their own story. We all relate on here and show support because we all share the same disease and it shows it’s nastiness in very similar ways for a lot of people.

Just know that you have your own story. You have the ability to start rewriting how and what tomorrow is going to bring by putting down the bottle.

Just from my experience, the tomorrows have been the best they’ve ever been.",3
2020-02-25 09:09:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f9ascl/a_crutch_i_didnt_realize_i_was_using/,A crutch I didn’t realize I was using,"I decided to stop drinking, not because I am an alcoholic, but because of the person I turn into when I drink. I stopped drinking because of the anxiety I feel for days at a time after drinking. I stopped drinking because of the fear I felt of having done or said something terrible after drinking.

I stopped drinking nearly 60 days ago.

I started to notice that I was really leaning on alcohol for stress management. Things would go wrong at work, so I would drink. I felt lonely, so I would drink. I would want to relax, so I would drink. I started to realize that anytime I began to feel uncomfortable I would tell myself, “have a few drinks, and take the edge off.”  But I caught myself... I realized that I was falling into a pattern of drinking anytime I felt uncomfortable. I realized that I’d have a drink, and would want to hide it because I didn’t want to hear my husband say that I was drinking with too much frequency. I realized that I was developing a problem. 

Over the last 60 days I’ve had to look at my feelings straight in the face. I cried everyday for 11 days straight. I kept wondering wtf was wrong with me, and why I was crying so much. And then I realized....

I took away my own crutch, my pacifier, that I was using to subdue my feelings. I wasn’t drowning out those feelings of loneliness with alcohol anymore . I wasn’t managing stress with alcohol anymore. I wasn’t diluting (and sometimes igniting) my anger with alcohol anymore. I was actually feeling my feelings. 

This afforded me a great opportunity, however. I’ve been able to think through and assess my feelings with clarity. look my feelings in the face and contemplate them. Address them. 

I was shocked at the initial realization that I was basically medicating myself with alcohol. You watch TV and you see actors chugging drinks after stressful situations, and you think nothing of it. It’s so casual. When you do that in real life, however, you’re seriously creating more obstacles and problems for yourself.

For the first time in years I owned that I’m not drinking anymore. I told a friend, “I don’t drink anymore (after she propositioned that’s we get buzzed at a bar for happy hour) but I’m happy to have a seltzer with lime and enjoy the new bar with you.” It felt good. It felt good to own that I don’t drink anymore. I used to care what people would think, and frankly the benefits are so massive that I don’t feel like I’m telling them that I can’t drink because I have issues with alcohol, it feels like I’m telling them that I don’t drink because I love the benefits of it. 

Crazy what a little reflecting and different perspective can do for oneself.",110

I'll start with a bit of history I guess, I'm not much of a writer so I apologize for the rambling and formatting before hand.

I've always been a pretty heavy drinker with some other substance abuse issues in the past, mainly cocaine. I've been free and clean of the drugs since 2006 but for some reason never viewed my drinking as a problem.

So a few years ago I moved to a new city and was in a terrible relationship, so I started hanging out with my friends and drinking more and more heavily. Ended up meeting my future wife during that period as my previous relationship finally fell apart. She was one of the funniest and most kind hearted people I had ever met. 

My wife and I were both heavy, heavy drinkers at the time. I was more of a weekend binge drinker, she drank a bit more during the work week and was a functional alcoholic. Once we ended up getting together she started to cut back quite a bit to be mostly a weekend binge drinker as well. 
We had a great time together on the weekends but had a pretty perfect relationship other than that for a long long time, ended up getting married within a year and a half of so dating. Everything was great for a few years.

Fast forward a few years and we started to have some issues all stemming from the alcohol use. We would have massive blow ups while drunk on the weekend which finally culminated in her punching me in the neck one night.

She used that low point as a driver to finally get sober, albeit with some bumps along the way. I withdrew further and l spent more and more time drinking on the weekends with supposed friends. We ended up separating during that time and began living apart. I cared more about going out drinking then trying to repair things which ended up leading to us not speaking for a few months. 

The thought of actually losing her finally gave me the wake up call I needed. I realized my so called ""friends"" never really cared about my daily life, just wanted to have a drinking buddy. Everything revolved around the next party. Removed myself from that friend group entirely at that point and reconnected with my wife in January of last year. Didn't quit drinking completely but cut down to once every couple of months

Things slowly but surely started to get back to the way things were in the beginning sans the alcohol. We were taking it very slow and had some bumps along the way but it finally seemed like we had a future again. She's been sober almost 2 full years now and I couldn't be more proud of her. She ended up buying a house recently and we were talking about moving back in together as soon as my lease was up. 

Fast forward to Friday night. 

Ended up going to a hockey game with my younger cousin, ended up having way too much to drink at the game. Went with my cousin to a local beer arcade after the game to meet up with his girlfriend and friends. Not long after getting there my cousin and his girlfriend/friends decided they wanted some blow and asked if I knew where to get any.

Being a fool I started to call/text around to people I thought might be able to help. Sure enough I ended up sending a text to my wife accidentally and she was understandably furious with me. I immediately jumped in an Uber to a liquor store not far from my house and walked home from there while talking to her on the phone on the way back trying to explain myself.

Once I got home I proceeded to drink even more and kept playing middle man between my cousin and a guy that called me back saying he could help out with the blow. Ended up staying up until 3-4 in the morning trying to arrange it and seriously considering getting some for myself before I blacked out drunk.
.
Woke up a few hours later still drunk as I had forgotten to take my sleeping medication the night before due to being black out drunk. I felt so ashamed of myself that I was that close to throwing away 14 years of being clean. 
Immediately sent the wife a message to talk. She was angry, hurt and asked what the hell I was doing. The guilt, shame and alcohol made me panic. I tried to lie to her and play it down like a moron and she saw right through me. 

She doesn't want anything to do with me at this point and I'm  just heartbroken. I love her so damn much and was so excited to finally be getting our life back on track. I hate myself for ruining it with alcohol and bad decisions AGAIN.
I hope we can work through things, but she deserves so much better. 

I don't know if getting sober will fix things and I don't blame her if it doesn't but I need to finally do it. Before I ruin myself and my life even further. 

Thanks for listening.",7

I really only drank because I was just bored. And so I'm still sober for 51 days now.

Last Friday I had a bender that last well into Saturday evening - I didn't intend to go out on Friday but circumstances led to my making poor decisions. I really only intended for 1 drink but with ""my friends"" it ended up being maybe over a dozen.

I've realise that they/their company influence me heavily since without them the urges are not nearly as strong.

The thing is now, that every evening since then they have started pestering me as to why I'm not out with them.

I want to be brutally honest and tell them that having considered my habits and behaviour it leads to I want to reassess my relationship with alcohol - although I know they will say some nonsense in retort that I could just spend time with them and not drink (which will inevitably lead to drinking).

Please help me and suggest ways for me to get out of this precarious situation?

I want to be the one of the group that shows the rest of the lm that sobriety is the way",2

But I find getting sober tough.  I posted a year ago about this and my situation is the same. I quit drinking, sometimes I'll manage to drink like one beer, but more often than not I won't and as soon as I start I can't stop.  I'll drink to excess, and put myself in awful situations.  And the next day I just wake up feeling sweaty and shaky, I just want to panic and kill myself.  However it's either I have another drink to calm myself down or power through the crazy thoughts and feelings.    
What happens is that I will stop drinking for say 1 month, every day I will remember how bad I'm hurting myself and others.  But after that month the bad memories start to fade, and I think 'yeah I can drink a couple'.  I'll have one beer with a meal, and think I'm improving.   Then I'll go to the bar and have a few and think 'wow I've managed a few, I can moderate',.  Then after that, I'll just go out drink a whole bottle of whisky, drink to excess, and be back to square one! I feel as soon as alcohol hit's my system, I'm just left craving more and more.  I never used to be this bad.   I'm seriously thinking of getting help, but then I often feel guilty, like I'm not an alcoholic so why am I getting help? Am I just weak?  
The last thing, being in a culture where socializing and alcohol/drugs are synonymous.  After not drinking for a while I just get bored.  I get the urge to party with my friends, go to raves etc. Even my sports hobbies revolve around alcohol.  I hate drinking, but I love it too, I've got so many memories from it.  Most of them bad but some good.  I think nostalgia makes me remember the good.   
For a relatively young age, I've lost a lot to alcohol, and I'd like to stop this before it becomes unbearable?

Does anyone have advice or can relate? Maybe people who've been in situations like this?

TL;DR I quit drinking for a month, drink for excession for 2-3 days, lose a lot, and repeat.",5

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning. 

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone. :) In a program I sometimes attend, they talk about being ""happy, joyous, free."" I cannot think of a better image of those words than of my stupid, goofy, loving basset hound named Humphrey. If I can live one day like him, it will be the best day of my life. But since I am not a basset hound, and I don't just rotate between sleep and play, I have to be a little intentional about the happy and joyous part. Without being mindful of happiness, I tend to run on autopilot and don't take time for laughter and play. Today, I am going to practice finding my happiness. 

I typed this last night, as I like to prep the DCI the night before because I typically wake up at 5:45AM EST and don't want to miss the deadline. I was listening to Apple Music crank out some bangers and playing fetch with my two dogs, one being [Humphrey](https://i.imgur.com/6OR01Ru.jpg). I was at peace. I was free. I made yesterday a good day- especially due to this group and all the affirmations and mantras. What's your happy, joyous and/or free look like today? IWNDWYT!",141

I managed the first strong urges of the early days, thanks to journaling on this sub for accountability.  My mind is getting clearer and, without shame or judgement, I really don't understand how any of us can prefer getting drunk to waking up sober.

My mood has shifted : from being anxious and self loathing, I'm now more angry and upset with myself. The good thing is that I can now act on this. Alcohol deprives me of any long-term thinking, without it I can actually start seeing a bit further than the next bottle of rum. It feels weird to be part of the world again.

I know it's only been 5 days, and I am extremely humble and cautious. But I'm proud with myself so far which is a feeling I had not felt in a long time.

Thank you all for your support. Lurkers and posters alike. Reading your posts, your experience, your relapse, your success is tremendously helping.

It was really sad. And it was sobering. 

Doctors at the ER last week told him he’s on his way to his deathbed if he doesn’t quit, but that only made him drink more after they released him. The shit isn’t cute. It’s not fun. It’s not funny.

The weirdest thing is, this last time, I didn’t have a huge desire to drink some days, but I did anyways. Forced myself to drink beers in a public situation. For no reason. 

I know all my reasons for wanting to stop but for some reason it’s still so hard. This place is an enormous help. I have spent about 3 hours tonight reading through so many posts. It’s so comforting to know I am not alone. I appreciate how candid everyone is and the embarrassing stories people tell about their journey. I appreciate the chance to put down in words my struggle and try to gather my thoughts. I have not talked to anyone in my life about it. One person knows that I am back to not drinking but not because I have a problem. 

I also appreciate that I have had sooo many day ones and everyone is still supportive in here. One of the main reasons no one in my life knows I am trying to stop drinking again is because no one believes me. So many sarcastic comments, laughing or just negative feedback.

I need to tell them that I can't keep working my current shifts and I need a change. I have completely justified reasons but I'm nervous.

I decided that I need to quit drinking after I was struggling to sleep the other night because I couldn't stop thinking about how overwhelmed I am with life at the moment. I was getting into catastrophic thinking about leaving my job, having to break my lease then having to move back to my hometown with my mum.

Usually I'd feel like it's okay to give myself some time to start making changes but I've already left this shift in my head, I have no intention of going back. The later I leave this the worse it'll look.

If I have to drink to handle the stress of my job then I shouldn't be working this job. Thinking about making this call is just making me think about my job as a whole and how much I hate it. I was desperate for work when I took it on and to begin with it was fine, but now I feel so burnt out by it. I have no support in the role. I haven't even met my boss in person.

What a waste of all those years feeling tired, weak and sore all the time. I’m definitely going to start hitting the gym as soon as I’m able( never gone to a gym so I’m a little nervous). I feel like there is more to unlock when I get some cardio built up. Another unexpected side affect is a increase in my libido, simultaneously cause for joy and frustration given my current situation. But I shouldn’t say things like that to you lol. I feel good. It was a good day and I’m thankful for making these changes to my life. I honestly could not have predicted that I would feel this way or how far down physically alcohol brought me.

I had no idea who I was. I'd been black out drunk every day for months and I'd some how convinced myself that this was okay. I'd managed to lie to myself for years that this was normal acceptable behaviour and I wasnt really killing myself mentally, physically, and literally. The hardest part was coming to terms that I didnt want to live that life anymore and that my life had become unmanageable and frankly absolutle hell because of alcohol.
 
Through trial and error, and believe me there was a lot of error  I finally made it through the first three days. There where many day ones, oh so many, but through struggle, commitment and frankly this page I kept trying and finally actually made it past the first week. 

After the initial  shock and anxiety of having to live life head on it got better. Little by little at first then like a stream role. It was like I'd been walking in the rain my entire life only to discover sunshine. I found myself actually smiling just cause which if I told you I'm known as a bit of a miserable bastard before will give you an idea of how little that happened. I'm not saying quiting alcohol was a cure all solution for my life, but when I stop actively poisoning myself everyday it deffinitly helped my see the good that was still here. Even better I'm finding the man I want to be more and more everyday.

I know I've got a long way to go and as an addict this is a fight I could fight on forever, and there are still bad days among the good ones, but the good days out way to bad one by a mile. Thanks for the support of my groups, my friends, and this page. With out all three I could never be here today 90 days sober.

Wish you all the best on your journeys,

2020-02-24 20:52:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f92hbh/21_miles_and_thoughts_on_being_sober/,21 miles and thoughts on being sober,"[10 mile post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/e6zbpq/recovery_and_running/)

In the above post, I wrote about finishing 2019 by running 10 miles on trails. A feat I never imagined undertaking. I went back to the same place this past Saturday and ran it again, twice, for a total of 21 miles. 

It was hard. The first loop wasn't too bad; I PR'd by 15 minutes and felt strong. I took time at the aid station to change into dry socks, grab some food, and stretch a bit before heading out to do my second and final loop. Within a mile, I realized this loop would be completely different. What had been solid ground previously had turned to mud as temperatures warmed into the 50s. 

I had wanted to do this race for a while. After my 10 mile trail run and my half marathon on January 1st, I decided I would do an ultra this Autumn. I had been building mileage and felt that a 21 mile trail run was manageable. I didn't have trail shoes but didn't think I'd need them; I didn't need them last time. I hadn't run over 13 miles. But what's a few more miles when you walk uphill to save energy? 

Since I slowed down so much to stay safe while jumping over creeks, walking over slippery tree branches and climbing uphill in the mud, I also had a lot of time to think. 

At one point, overlooking the fields down below, as my heart was beating so fast from exertion and I was drained with 5 miles to go, it hit me. I wouldn't be doing this if I wasn't sober. None of this. It hit me in that moment, with wet socks, muddy shoes, sore calves and legs, that this was exactly where I was meant to be and that as I've dived more into running and healing, drinking has become less of a constant nagging thought to a rare thought. 

So many times during my second loop, I kept saying ""This is the hardest thing I've ever done"" But it wasn't. Maybe physically, in that moment. But getting sober was the hardest thing I've ever done. 

Facing myself sober was hard.
Facing others sober was hard.
Facing my trauma, emotions, vulnerability was hard. 
Facing my needs, wants, desires was hard. 
Facing life without my easy crutch was hard. 

Getting sober brought me to my knees, literally. I spent so much time on the floor, looking at the ceiling, sobbing as I faced what hurt inside of me and who I hurt because of my drinking. I spent so much time in therapy, sobbing. I spent time writing. Making amends. Making more amends. Learning a few more things to make amends for. Changing behavior. Checking in with myself. Saying no to things. Saying yes to things I didn't want to at the time. I read books. Listened to podcasts. Watched movies. Checked into chat. Checked in with friends. Checked in with myself. I still do these things. But I also run.

And I know 100% I can only do these new hard things because I did and continue to do the hard work of being sober. 

Sobriety is not always easy at first. It wasn't for me. It was gut wrenching. Confusing. It pissed me off a lot. It left me raw so often. But all of that was necessary. I needed all of that to get to a place of complete surrender to a process of learning how to live this life without the crutch of alcohol. 

And these thoughts are what got me through the last 2 miles of 3 massive hills to climb with a body that hurt so much ""I'm doing this because I'm sober"" because once I was able to reach a place of knowing I can live and thrive sober, nothing feels that impossible anymore. 

And as a sober goddess says a lot ""You can do the hard things""

If you're just starting out or still trying to figure out what you're doing 1000 days in, I promise, you can do this. You 100% can do the hard things.",9

my therapist reminded me today that the last time I got to this place was the last time I relapsed.   things started getting real, and going well for me, and I had to step up and be responsible and I just let it all crash on me.

not this time.  I have to be brave and step into my new life.  its so scary, people look at me and they don't see a relentless fuck up, they see a business owner.  I don't know how its all going to work.

Normality seems to be returning to my marriage and my mental state.  Feeling good about progress - v happy to have put some time between me and last incident.

Have declined or avoided alcohol in a number of triggering settings- this feels fine and little effort at the moment, however I did feel the hint of wistfulness seeing craft beer labels during a pub dinner. 

I will need to manage my thinking on this as time passes.

To bear in mind:

1. Drinking isn’t fun for me like it used to be.

2. When drinking with others, I invariably devote significant mental energy to how to get the next one/further ones- if I don’t get it I fee unhappy and hard done by.

3. When drinking by myself there is a grimly automatic process that sets in- my urge is to swill as much as possible in as short a period as possible with little savouring and actual sensual enjoyment. Then what? Hunt around for more? 

4. For a number of reasons, a small amount will do me in now. I have never had a great tolerance but that period of enjoyable drunkenness before incapacity has shrunk substantially.

5. Best case scenario afterwards, a hangover now makes me depressed, listless and ineffectual for days.

6. Worst case scenario afterwards, I could cause the breakup of my family like a true wretch who does not control his own life.

7. I have real responsibilities to people I love- getting back into old patterns means abandoning my dependents.

I will be going back to AA in coming weeks and will maintain involvement in various forms of peer support.",8

In this box I've written 10 reasons not to drink, 10 reasons to be sober. Maybe they can be useful for someone who has a craving:

**10 reasons not to drink:**

\- I don't have blackouts and dangerous traffic situations

\- I don't have hangovers and medically dangerous situations like vomiting in my bed

\- I don't send shameful messages and damage relationships due to drunk actions

\- I don't partake in hazardous sexual behaviours

\- I don't spend so much money

\- I would lose health and a youthful look if I would drink

\- I would lose my improved dopamine reward system and return to easy shortterm rewards

\- I would lose working on longterm solution for my insecurities and anxieties and opt for shortterm solutions like escapism

\- The strong matches I have between my authentic self and my friends would weaken, I would get drinking buddies that support the bad behaviour

\- I wouldn't grow emotionally anymore, I would lose myself in escapism.

**10 reasons to stay sober:**

\- I can genuinely say that I like who I am

\- I can learn much more everyday from life.

\- I learned how to forgive myself for mystakes, and by extension, how to forgive others for their mistakes.

\- I'm more empathetic

\- I'm physically fit and like how I look in the mirror

\- I experience positive emotions more strongly. I work with my emotions to find solutions instead of drowning them away.

\- I wear less masks in life and behave more like my authentic self in situations.

\- I'm more humble, my ego and pride doesn't keep me locked in my comfort zone. This allows me to try new things.

\- I feel my cognitive abilities, self-discipline and other brain functions have increased.

\- I feel my social skills have improved. I feel that I learn social skills quicker because of the increased empathy.",64

-We, unfortunately, live in a society where drinking is the perceived answer to stress. You just can't escape that.
-I must have been nicer/calmer when I was drinking everyday even though I never drank at work.
-It is apparently well known in my office that I self-medicated with wine.
-Considering he's not the 1st coworker to make a ""joke"" about me having a drink to de-stress, I have apparently not made it clear enough to those around me that I'm serious about this.

I'm 3 months into this journey. I make it 5-ish days then the stress/anxiety wins. My longest is 10 days sober. At my worst, I was drinking 2 bottles a day and not skipping a beat at work (and apparently a lot nicer.) I'm now drinking less than 2 bottles a week and working towards total sobriety.

My ""sober acne"" (which is an unwelcomed surprise to those female heavy wine drinkers) has finally cleared up, I'm getting stronger/faster in the gym, and a sleep like a hibernating bear. I am not giving up!

So, try to brush off those ""little"" comments and stay strong! No matter how many times you ""fail"" keep trying!  Y'all are inspirational!",11

I'm in my 50s and have been a binge drinker all my life.   I don't like it, bad things have been happening, it's gotten worse, and it may be time to call it quits.

I really love electronic music and have been going to events/raves since the 90s, and there is a recurring outdoor free house music party I love going to.  Normally I'd bring 7 or 8 tall cans of beer with me and get a bit sloppy.  Yesterday I attended again, this time I didn't bring any alcohol.  I was pretty nervous that I'd get bored quickly.  Instead, the music was hitting me just right and I was getting an endorphin rush just from dancing.  I felt incredible.  I can't tell you what a relief that was.

Bonus, I didn't leave the event all messed up and $40 lighter from taking Uber to and from, and with a slightly annoyed partner.  There was no urge to keep the party going by doing shots when I got home, as I had done so many times in the past.  And I woke up today clear as a bell with no regret or remorse.

I'm nervous about the future,  but now a little bit less so.

Well, I’m 6 months sober today.

I have mixed feelings. I know, for a fact, that my life is far better this way but there are some personal and psychological barriers I’m facing that feel like they are constantly compromising my sobriety. 

I’m questioning myself and I swear sometimes I catch my brain subconsciously trying to advocate moderation.. or telling me that I can do coke because it wasn’t as much of a problem.. but it was...

I don’t intend to crack and give in to these pressures at the current moment and this sub is hugely influential in keeping me on the right path. I’m still motivated to stay clean but it’s been tough lately. 

Thank you. You guys are fucking inspirational.",163

By sharing our experiences, giving encouragement and posting our highs and lows will help us all to kick this shit once and for all. I have a really embarrassing moment that happened to me while I was drinking and I have posted this before, a long time ago. My partner was at work and it was 12.30 afternoon. Out came my bottle of wine. I was nearly finished it when the door bell went( I had locked door as per usual I case someone just came in and caught me), I completely panicked thinking that this was partner home early. Downed the last few gulps from bottle and hid it, rushed to bathroom for mouthwash...NONE! Took my can of deodorant and gave a quick spray near my mouth being careful not to get it right in my gob, how I thought this would mask the smell god knows. Well I went to the door, it was just the postman, anyhoo went to bathroom to brush my teeth,looked in the mirror and all round my lips and chin it was pure white!!  The poor postman must have thought I was nuts. I can laugh now but then I could have died of embarrassment 😱😱🤪 lol. Peace out ya all. IWNDWYT 💋",5

It was hard to keep it together at work today, and it still is right now as I cook dinner.

Anyone else feel this way around this long sober?

My past couple of relapses have caused a bad stabbing pain in my stomach, I drank two nights ago and the pain hasn’t gone away. I figured it was time to get it checked out. I’ve never told a doctor about my drinking,hell, today is the first time I really brought it up to my therapist. 
I’m going to be 100% honest with the doctor, as many of y’all urged me. It’ll be hard, but I’ll be truthful. 


I’m scared, I know I’m not going to be judged, but I’m still paranoid about it.I’m also just nervous of the results, I don’t expect it to be serious. but this is potentially my first medical consequence of drinking and that fact alone is scary regardless of severity.


I certainly will not be drinking tonight. And honestly, I think this is good for me. It’s going to be good to see I’m not invivincible. 
Also the copay was $50 and I was too embarrassed to ask my parents to cover it so, I’m seeing how expensive my habit can be, that was half my bank account and a rough blow after draining it with my drinking over the past few months.





Edit: waiting on a white blood cell count now..... :( I’m scared as shit.


Edit 2: aaaand now I’m waiting on the results. I’ve never been so scared at the doctors office. Whether there is a problem or not I gotta get serious about quitting! I can’t go through all this anxiety and waiting again

I just took my meds for the day and started thinking about one of them, Naltrexone, that I had no idea existed until recently. Look, I'm not a pharma shill OR a doctor so take this as you will. 

I'm not entirely sure how it works exactly, but it's a treatment for opiate addiction as well as alcoholism. I do know that you CANNOT take opiates while on it, but you *can* drink...but it makes you not want to. At least it makes me not want too. My doc tells me it can help disassociate alcohol from certain emotions. It can make it so that first sip isn't a rush of endorphins, but a mouthful of liquor. I haven't had a drink while taking it, nor do I intend to (woo 90 day club) - but a friend of the family took it when he was in recovery, and said that drinking was just not the same. Drunk felt just sluggish and gross. Beer became stale and gross. Liquor was acrid and unpleasant. Seems like it just takes all the fun out of drinking and leaves you with the shit, on a chemical level.

Again, I'm not a doctor. If you have one, talk to them about this drug. Research it yourself. I wish I knew about it years ago.

Again, I’m only stating that to give whoever reads this an idea who/what they’re reading about. 

I’ve gotten myself in quite the pickle, and I don’t know where to even begin to find help. I’ve known for some time that my drinking was getting out of control, because in the morning I’ll say “I’ll stay sober tonight” but by the time 5 or 6 rolls around it’s been getting easier and easier to justify drinking. I can’t seem to go one day without drinking, and I couldn’t tell you the last time I was sober for 24 straight hours. My wife and I are expecting our first baby in July, and I MUST be sober by then. I quit smoking in January, and it’s time to get my drinking under control now too. But I have sooooo many questions/concerns, and here’s a few: 

Is it realistic to say that “I’ll just drink on the weekends” or “I’ll just cut back?” 

Does anyone else struggle with thinking they won’t be happy without it? Or won’t be able to have as much fun? 

Lastly, how does one go about finding an AA meeting, if that’s what I end up needing? 

I feel proud when I read through all of your posts on this page. It’s inspiring, but on the contrary it’s not so inspiring that I can quit myself. Please don’t take offense to that, I’m just trying to be straightforward with whoever takes the time out of their day to read this. If you’ve made it this far, thank you so much for reading this, and any advice you can offer would be greatly appreciated. 

Have a wonderful day 😊",29

Anxiety and depression sky rocket from the after effects of alcohol consumption. Suicide is 120x more likely in Men when alcohol is involved. Alcohol floods the central nervous system and flushes out all the serotonin, dopamine and oxycontin needed for a healthy and functioning brain. From what I’ve read the brain doesn’t begin to balance out until days and even weeks later.

From my own personal experience, I always thought something was wrong with me mentally. I was on anti-depressants for years and just thought that I was a depressed and anxious person. Needless to say I was binging heavily on the weekends. Maybe I was hungover the next day, but it never even crossed my mind that alcohol was a major factor in all the negative thoughts and panic attacks days later. Now that that shit is out of my system I feel much more balanced. I still feel emotions - angry, sad, depressed - but it’s nothing I can’t deal with now. Before I would simply spin out of control and stew in my own shit. I can handle it all now without anti-depressants.

People often don’t want to hear about these effects about alcohol because it’s been such a good “friend” over the years. It was for me. However as many complain about the problems in their lives, they never look at those couple of hours of fun that leads to 10x more in mental pain and suffering after. As long as they aren’t homeless or broken everything is all good. People don’t have to let this progress before things spin out of control mentally. 

Why is this not discussed more? What can we do to create more awareness?",18

Dangerous place I know, but thankfully I made it through just fine and it actually wasn’t that hard. This story isnt really about me. Bear with me, im bad at telling stories sometimes. 

So Im standing in line at the bar because they have delicious non-alcoholic beverages available and im indulging (honestly it helps to not drink, because im already having a treat!), and the person in front of me looks…..strange. Like he is uncomfortable. Its hard to place what I was noticing but he looked preoccupied and like something was just off. 

Anyways the guy gets to the front and asks the bartended for a vodka and orange juice. Bartender says “Si?”, like he didn’t hear him and its loud so its understandable. Also its Mexico and they don’t all speak great English. So he repeats the order to the bartender. Bartender says “Oh ok! Orange juice!” and proceeds to put ice in a glass, and then fill it with juice. 

Just juice. 

Im next, but the guy in front of me just stands there staring at the glass. Bartender is juggling people from a few lines, so he keeps doing his thing. The guy grabs it really slowly and is looking at it and it looks like he is trying to solve some complex calculus. Im not sure if I wanted him to move, or if its just the social awkwardness I sometimes get but I make the joke/comment while moving up to the bar for my turn: “It looks like he forgot your vodka!”. 

The man turns to me and kind of stares blankly. Bartender asks me what I want, and I indicate something I cant pronounce from the menu in the “non-alcoholic” section. 

At this point, slowly after a pause, the man speaks: “This would have been my first drink in 22 years, Im in AA. I have been here for almost a week already and…. I honestly don’t know why today was going to be the day. I was just going to have this drink, I don’t know why. Im going to take this as a sign from someone out there though……”. 

He trails off and begins walking away, I stopped him and mentioned that im sober too and we have a little chat. Nothing significant but he said he was going to double down on being careful and wont be giving into those strange temptations again. I wished him luck. 

It was a short interaction overall, but it really had an impact on me. It reinforced that I cant ever be lazy with recovery because who knows when, even 22 years later, something is going to click and I could make some bad choices. This was near the start of my trip and I don’t know if it helped me to be sober for it but I certainly thought about it a lot over the past week. This one interaction felt like an entire meeting packed into about a minute and a half. 

I don’t know if I believe in a higher power in the sense that it can influence things like that, more likely the bartender didn’t hear him, but these are the kinds of interactions that can make you think.",219

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

I was listening to a recorded talk by an [AA speaker](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx0yuE0aLAM ) where he talked about “the prison of loneliness.” He talked about learning to recognize that others might be trapped in the same prison of loneliness that had so often gripped him when he was active in his addiction. Recognizing that others might be suffering similarly allows him to have compassion for others instead of taking offense and interpreting their behavior negatively.

I’ve been struck this week by the way my relationships with others have changed now that I’m in recovery. I lived in the prison of loneliness for a lot of years, and the more my drinking problem progressed, the worse it got. In sobriety I’m able to connect with others more, but my reflex is still to make other people’s behavior about me. 

So my AoK this week, both towards myself and other people in my life, has been cultivating compassion for others. I’ve been paying attention to the fact that I don’t know what’s going on with anyone else. I still want to interpret how other people act, as if I know what’s going on in their mind and in their life. I don’t. I [barely know what’s going on with me](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q7ZZVJ120A4).

Having humility about that allows me to be more emotionally available to other people. I’m able to offer genuine support, instead of spinning my wheels and getting worked up about what I *think* is going on.

So that’s me for this week, sobernauts. I apologize for the late post and my relative absence recently. I’ve been pulled in a couple of different directions, but I know that that isn’t sustainable, so I’m changing my schedule so I’m more able to take care of myself and so I don’t get totally burned out. Which is an AoK in itself. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",15

In one I couldn’t ride with the rest of my family to our event because I had to go somewhere else first. In one I was trying to CLIMB A LADDER WHILE HOLDING A BICYCLE. Weird stuff. So I woke up at 5 and my mind was racing with “what was all that... does any of it make sense?” 

And it just clicked. All of those were a metaphor for alcohol. I’ve felt held back, Like I’ve been struggling, like I’m fighting against something so out of my control for so long. And it’s all alcohol. It truly does stand in the way of me and the rest of my life. I’m taking back control. Here’s to stopping the madness and not letting alcohol control me, in my dreams or not.",3

I didn't think about it for a few reasons. I was finishing a move into a new apartment with my life partner while nursing a very sore back. I was visiting a friend in treatment. I was having a tattoo consult with my partner, our form of a wedding ring. I was worrying about my brother who has a case of the flu so bad that he had to go to the ER.

I can do all of these things today because I am sober. I met my partner while sober and helped her get clean. I met my friend in who is in treatment while sober and helped him get into treatment. I deepend  my bond with my brother when I lived with his family for a year right after my own treatment. I keep my career by going to treatment and staying sober and now I make enough money to live in a great apartment in a wonderful neighborhood.

I woke up five years and a day ago, it was a monday, sick and scared. I couldn't remember the weekend nor 4 of the previous 5. My tailbone hurt because I slipped and fell at work a week prior while still drunk from the night before. I was a week from homelessness and was heading for unemployment.

I made a decision that morning that changed my life. I decided that I couldn't live like that any more and called my boss and told him I was going to treatment. Somehow some way I was going, I didn't have insurance yet as the job was new but I got help and got in. I still have that job and I am steadily moving up the ranks in the field.

Everything I have today from my career to my relationships to my financial wellbeing I owe to my sobriety and to communities like this one who have helped me along the way. I still have plenty of work to do but it is work I do gladly and gratefully.

Thank you to every single person who reads this today. The simple idea that I may be able to help someone else on their journey sustains and humbles me.

I'm now stuck in a dead marriage as my husband will not divorce ""he doesn't know how to continue with out me"", a teenager, I love her but teenagers kinda suck and a 5 year old.  

I'm trying so hard to stay sober but things like yesterday happen and I just don't know how to cope. I had a concussion last week from a skiing accident supposed to be resting, but I'm still cooking cleaning and everything else. I found out yesterday have to return to work early because there's no one to cover me, my grandpa collapsed and now needs and additional surgery after the one last week. My bff calls me she's injured leg badly and is on crutches and her mom just had a stroke, she needs my help with her young baby, in between hospital visits, grabbing decor for sons upcoming party, figuring out dinner.... Ahhhhhh!!!! I broke and downed half a mickey of vodka after dinner. I hate myself today. I'm mad at myself for giving in but I don't know how to deal.

I went out to see a local band with some new friends this past weekend. I was nervous BUT I don't want sobriety to mean that I don't have fun anymore. When I got to the venue, a good amount of my old drinking buddies were there. Someone put a shot of jack in my hand and I can't believe I handed it back and said no. WHO IS THIS PERSON :)

I listened to a lot of Annie Grace's Podcast (This Naked Mind) and I remember her talking about how being buzzed/drunk is the same experience whether you're at a ball game, a concert, out with friends, home by yourself, etc. It just feels like getting drunk. Even though we think alcohol heightens these experiences, it actually robs us of it because we just feel numb. But because I stayed sober I got to actually experience the true natural high of dancing and singing. I feel so cheesy, but I cried on my drive home. I was just overwhelmed with gratitude. I never thought I could say no to drinking. I've tried so many times before and failed. I am so unbelievably proud of myself and I feel like this was a big milestone. :)

The only times I felt a little weird scary twinge was when the shot was put in my hand, and then again when the band ended their set and everyone was talking about going to a bar afterwards. But I took a deep breath, said good night to everyone and went home. It felt so dam good to make some good decisions after all these years of believing I will always be a fuck up. 

Thanks for listening, I really have no sober friends and it feels nice to tell people who get it!",11

I started the habit because I think drinking keeps me further from spiritual fulfillment. But I also see it as a yearly stress-test to check if my drinking has become so problematic that the withdrawal is dangerous. I've slowly come o realize that even the fact I think I need a stress test is a sign of problematic drinking. I've tried to stop outside of Lent before. This summer I had months of sobriety after listening to This Naked Mind. Sadly, I started drinking again on a trip to Germany with my father.   


I didn't mean for this post to be so long. It's just that I want to be done with alcohol. And I've wanted to be done for a long time. The nice thing about Lent is that it gives me cover. When someone asks if I want a drink, I can say: I gave it up for Lent. But I want to stay dry after Lent, too. I just need the ability to attack the anxiety that results when I think of never drinking again.

I’m one of those people that hides in plain sight. High-functioning, drinking patterns probably even seem normal. But it’s really impeding my health and fitness goals. I’m at the point where I can have 6 drinks over a few hours and feel exhausted and gross but not drunk. 

I think my issue is that I don’t know if I will be okay with ever drinking again. I don’t want to be the person who doesn’t drink at Christmas and Thanksgiving. I like to enjoy a glass of wine or whiskey. But I can’t say “just holidays” without it spilling over into everyday life within a week.

He refuses to do any research on the subject, and has told me I'm not an alcoholic because he's seen me stop for weeks at a time previously. 

When I drink, I drink into serious 3 to 5 day benders. Each day gets worse until my body physically will not hold alcohol down any longer. Then it's a huge shame spiral and I do it all over again. 

How do you make someone without the same problem understand?

Just because I've stopped for weeks before doesn't mean I dont have a problem. He thinks I keep doing this because I want to, and that's not it at all. 

To sum it up I've been told ""alcoholism doesn't give you off days""

I think for me though, reading of the horrors of hangovers, bloat, puffiness, and overall health issues is enough of a scare me away. There seems to be a lot of these stories of late and it’s really affected me in a positive way.

I recently went to a casino and it was just dumb. I’m not a gambler (spouse wanted to go) but also the lack of alcohol really made it even less enjoyable - will not go back.

Went out to eat at a local chain restaurant and EVERY PAGE had an advertisement for some form of alcohol... never really noticed that before. Food did taste better than I remember though.

I think after a month my stomach is finally healed up - I no longer am running to the bathroom when I get the urge. Ive never experienced this in my adult life. 

I feel skinny? Weird because I haven’t really lost any weight. I was hoping that the lack of calories from alcohol would translate to automatic weight loss but - I’ve been eating a wee bit more than usual. I told myself - one thing at a time, get alcohol under control then worry about the food part. I’m not eating 500 Big Macs a day or anything but maybe just a bit more than usual? I have not been eating my late night alcohol induced “snack binge”.

My skin feels amazing. Such an odd thing to notice? My skin color and feel has changed - I look human? Have had many people tell me that I look different and they guess as to the why.

I feel great and I cherish testing myself during occasions where previously I’d have got shitfaced. I like to see it as me retraining my brain to view alcohol differently.

For example, this weekend just gone I went to Cardiff to watch wales play france in the rugby. I’ve been to Cardiff to watch rugby countless times and every time previously I’d make it my mission to get hammered. The decision to get hammered would be concrete and it would never even be up for debate. On those drunk days out I’d take every opportunity to drink as much beer as possible so that I could really ‘enjoy’ the day. Yet, I’d forget the game, I’d spend a ton of money, and I’d spend half the match at the bar or the toilet.

But this weekend I treated it as a little experiment. ‘Can I enjoy a weekend in the same way whilst totally sober?’. Yes. It was exactly the same, if not better. I had great interactions with people and I wasn’t relying on a crutch to have fun. I also had two meaningful conversations with two other guys who had done 12 months and 6 years of sobriety respectively. If I was drunk I’d never had gained those insights from them

TLDR: At the start of the year I promised myself and my friends that I’d do at least 12 months sober. 2 months in and I’m really enjoying it and I have literally no desire to drink anymore",16

This past Thursday evening I started noticing I wasn’t feeling very well toward bed time, and woke up Friday morning running a fever hovering near 100F until yesterday afternoon. This came along with cold/flu/cough symptoms. The only medicine I had besides ibuprofen (which I used to handle things the best I could) was a liquid cough/cold syrup. I only took the recommended amount (30ml) once Friday and once Saturday. I noticed immediately the first time I took it Friday that it must have an alcohol content to it. Checked the label and then confirmed. I guess this is why I feel guilty taking it again Saturday, even though it was in the correct amount and not abused.  

Anyone else experience this type of feeling? Feeling guilty even though I did nothing wrong? I currently can’t drive (due to good old alcohol) to get myself to the store for any other medication. I just can’t shake the feeling like maybe I should have just powered through the sickness and the weekend? I am proud to say that although I was tempted, I did not have anyone bring me a bottle of whiskey so I could drown myself in hot toddy’s because it’s a “cure”. Baby steps.

But, moderation is a good thing. Life, I believe, should be enjoyed with variety, and moderation.

Even though my use was moderate, I was using a lot of brain energy to maintain this moderation, and true moderation shouldn’t require that much effort or thought - I think - idk for sure, I’ve never been one to moderate anything, that’s just kinda who I am, all or nothing. I’m working on that, or at least trying to channel that mindset to healthy alternatives.

I drink about 1-2x a week and am actually within the limit for what my doctor says is acceptable. But it doesn’t feel healthy. It feels over the top and it makes me feel out of control. 

I want to quit drinking but I just can’t seem to stick to it. I don’t feel like I know how to overcome the urge. 

I guess I’m looking for help on tactics to stick to just one, or tactics to just not drink. But still going out. 

It feels like there has to be a way to help the urges or fight them. Or something. And I’m just at a loss.",3

Then ""ah, I'll drink b/c tonights a special occasion""... blah blah - back to basically drinking every night last week. 

Then something new has started happening.  I stared bickering with my girlfriend when I drink.  Perhaps there is a root cause but definitely the drinking exacerbates it.   

So, now I'm sick and tired of feeling like crap and I'm an otherwise ""always happy"" individual but feel blue as hell right now.  Its the funk of alcohol.

The afternoons are the hardest.  I can feel like shit all day long and then when 5 o'clock rolls around I want to reach for a drink.  I've got to figure out how to get passed that witching hour!!  I mean I WILL figure out how to get passed 5 o'clock without drinking.",2

I can't change the past, but I do have the power to change the future. This week hasn't been transformative by any means, I'm still sad, my husband and I still haven't resolved our issues, but I do feel more present. And I don't have to struggle to remember what exactly happened after 8 pm. It's also easy to get up in the morning and I feel like I'm on the road to becoming a role model for my kids. In short, 1 week of sobriety has convinced me I want to take on another week. I hope you all have a good week.

Numbing myself with alcohol when any intrusive thought or feeling came to mind meant I never truly dealt with anything. It seems my longest period of sobriety in my adult life has lead to me spending actual hours on my own thinking as if to make up for time. 

I'm asking myself tough questions, addressing why I drank in the first place and these thoughts lead down many different rabbit holes, some are long forgotten happy memories and some are big barriers I'm still struggling with. 

The major issue I seem to have is the lack of love for myself, I realised how bad it actually was when a fellow member here said they looked at their reflection in a mirror and said ""I love you"" which was followed by many cathartic tears. I immediately tried this out for myself, but I couldn't bring myself to say those words.

Still early days yet, today is a tough day emotionally but the desire to drink is not one of them, I'll once again appreciate these normal human feelings whether they are good or bad and I'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts and feelings of self love, whether existing or developing, they may help us both.

Alcohol seduces me and lies to me constantly and I still, clearly, have not learned my lesson yet.

So I didn't quit cold turkey, because I am a heavy beer drinker for almost 10 years and my withdrawals when quitting cold turkey come close to death. I was so afraid of it I started slowing down with the amounts I intake whole last week. So, usually, if I would drink 6-7 liters of 6% alc. beer per day, I slowed it down to 1 liter on Friday and did not drink from Saturday completely.

When I woke up on Saturday I had a usual panick attack, but it was not as strong. I made myself eat a breakfast and still felt alcohol aftertaste in my mouth the whole day. It was a long Saturday thinking about alcohol all day and trying to further my mind away from it.

Sunday came. Felt better when I woke up. No more nausea. Was very hungry. Ate a good full breakfast. Also was eating light healthy snacks all day, smoked cigarettes, ate sweets, but the feeling that something is missing remained. And I knew exactly what I was missing. But I still held up. Tried not to think about it by playing video games all day, which helped time go faster.

Today I woke up without any panick attack at all. My mind is clear. I feel no hangover, my constant diarrhoea has ended, my hands shake only just a little, but it may be from the cold, I have an appetite and my social anxiety starts fading away. This 3rd day is the first day I want to talk to people or share my thoughts. This is incredible. I haven't had a day like this for years without alcohol.

One minus is that I now can't fall asleep until 4a.m., and sleep for 6-7 hours. But I feel rested.

I still constantly think about popping a cold one and I hope this fades away in time. This annoys me a lot.

TLDR: 3 days sober, anxiety fading away, appetite coming back, a bit harder to fall asleep, diarrhoea ended, still feel urge to drink, but fighting it. Head feels clearer, starting to want to socialize. Will continue not to drink.

It’s one of those facebook moments where you’re scrolling through your feed and it takes you a second when the news article pops up because you recognize and know the guy. 

I didn’t know him that well - he was a grade younger than me - but this guy was going to be a real winner. Family was loaded, bright guy and friends with everyone, went on from our podunk high school to be an Ivy League School grad, started a promising career. Then imagine my complete shock at reading his obituary and seeing the cause of death sandwiched in there with all of his accomplishments - organ failure from alcoholism. Seems insane. Creeped on his Facebook and it’s still up, he was posting about Pete Buttigeg three days before he died from organ failure. 

Like, that’s my age. Hell, that’s a year younger than me. What the hell.  I remember those virgin days in my early 20s of lurking SD in 2012 - suffering from mild WDs too afraid to make an account - thinking “man, this is awful but I’ve got time before my body giving out - I can milk this for another decade and be fine”. But he’s dead. Left behind a fiancé and everything. Wonder if she knew how bad it was or if he was great at hiding it.

Like I know this disease doesn’t discriminating in intelligence (if anything it’s worse on those who are particularly empathetic and intelligent), but what’s wild is that on the outside this dude was set. Ivy League school, overachiever, incredibly smart, wealthy family,  probably could afford the best care/therapy to fight it, etc. but it didn’t seem to matter. I think any alcoholic knows that no one “accidentally” drinks themselves into organ failure in their early 30’s because they’re loving life.

I’ve had issues with alcohol since, idk, 2016? I started out binge drinking, then it was daily drinking, and then it was just a constant back and fourth between the two. My drinking became daily again in December, it escalated until I reached the beginning of January and began to have severe anxiety when I didn’t drink. I had this gut feeling that things were going to get bad if I didn’t quit for good, so I quit. Detoxing was hell, much worse than any of the previous times. I learned what addiction really meant that week. At 9 days sober I went to my first AA meeting. Things were going great. I reached 24 days then relapsed, and my life has been chaos ever since.


 The first day of the relapse I noticed stomach pain the moment alcohol hit my gut (probbaly evcause I fasted), but I powered through, wincing through the growing pain. I eventually puked, tried to drink more, but couldn’t stomach it. I’d never been so reckless in the past. Worst of all though, that day my partners dog died. He needed somome, but I told him it wasn’t a good day for him to come over. Because all my selfish ass cared about was getting drunk. I also went to steal my roommates JD that night, but couldn’t find it. That was all wildly out of character. That of course didn’t stop me, I drank the following day, in the middle of the day (something I didn’t do). I skipped therapy because I was drunk, put off projects for work, and neglected homework. The third day of the relapse I nearly got hit by a car rushing home to drink. I got sober again after that, for 8 days. The first 3 days were dark, I almost relapsed with intent to seriously harm myself, but got picked up by a guy from AA that I called. 


After 8 days I relapsed again and snorted adderall 3 days in a row, then tried to find meth because I wanted a more intense high but had no luck (thank god) 

Last night, at 2 days sober I drank. I drank out of pure apathy. I drank heavier than usual. And only had a few pizza rolls for dinner beforehand. I got far more drunk than I usually do. Once again I drank through stomach pain, drank past the point where I knew I should quit. I stumbled into the shower at some point. All I remember about the shower is being on my hands and knees puking my guts out. I puked red, and I remember thinking “I hope this is fucking blood and I hope I fucking die” it coulda just been the pizza rolls, but is scary looking back, because I really don’t know. Also just he whole “I hope I die” mindset...While drunk and while recklessly apathetic. I feel like I keep growing more apathetic, I keep caring less and less about recovery, I keep growing more selfish and shit.


Today’s hangover has been hellish, the first time I puked it almost looked like there were bits of old blood, but again, I don’t know for sure. Blood or not I still have that stabbing pain in my stomache, it concerns me, especially since I’m still tempted to drink. Despite my fear my biggest reasoning to not drink is the fact that I don’t think I can stomach alcohol, and want to save my booze for a day I can.  


With each relapse I get more reckless, more apathetic, more aggressive with my drinking. I can’t do this again. I don’t know how long I’ll keep bouncing back into recovery mode,and I don’t know how long my body can take the abuse.


I’m a college student in my final semester, with how my university works inpatient just isn’t possible. I’d have to return for another semester, and really just can’t afford that. I’m already up to my neck in debt. I also don’t think inpatient is necessary anyways. 

Any suggestions? I don’t really have any ideas of the treatment options that are out there. I just wanna fuckin’ beat this beast. And idk, maybe something more intensive is overkill, but I don’t know how to gauge what’s “bad enough”

Also, if I do go through with some form of treatment I’d have to tell my mom about my alcoholism :( I’m on her insurance, and also couldn’t pay for it alone. She’s an alcholic too and is unlikely to take me seriously since I’m the “pussy drinker” of the family. How do I manage that?",3

2020-02-23 22:00:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f8kpev/made_it_to_day_5/,Made it to day 5!,"Hello, I’ve been lurking for a little bit but this is my first post. Apologies if it’s long... & for rambling... I tend to do that, haha. I just needed to get this out there.

So basically I (33,M) decided to quit drinking about a month ago after having my first ever panic attack due to withdrawal after yet another 3-day blackout bender. At the time I thought I was having a seizure, and it definitely put the fear of what can happen if I keep up my lifestyle of getting absolutely trashed 3-4 days in a row every week. 

So far, my days off have been my downfall. I can get through the work week fine (as in not drinking, not as in feeling like I’m not a groggy, bloated zombie for those 4 days) but as soon as I would clock out I would head straight home, sit around for a few hours and ultimately crack open my first drink. That first one would turn into 2, 2 into 5 etc... all the way up to about 20 or so drinks. Then I would eat too much pizza and crash out in my bed until the next afternoon/evening when I would wake up and immediately start day 2 of my bender for the week. 

This continues for the next couple of weeks until today. Yesterday was probably the first time in a long time where I just came home after work, watched a movie and went to bed. Largely due to the fact that I had only been able to sleep for about 3 hours a night all week... But I still did it!

So now we’re on day 5 of being sober and the first day of my “weekend”. So far it hasn’t been too bad, still kinda groggy and anxious but nothing as bad as day 3 was. Even though my symptoms were mild, 10-11 hours working with the fatigue from that was killing me. 

However I’m worried about running out of things to do over the next few days, getting the urge to drive down to the store and pick up a few drinks. I’m hoping that I can just go to the store, pick up a bunch of gummy candy, some chips/nuts, and maybe a few root beers. Then come home and play some Fallout or pick up a Lego set or 2 to keep me occupied. One thing’s for sure, IWNDWYT.",13

And it caught up to me again.... like it always does. But I’m more than a month sober and it feels good!  I love being hangover free, I’m sleeping better, am less grouchy and impatient and generally functioning much better all around. I’m meeting my responsibilities better and am much more present for my family. 

Btw, here is a story I remember from years ago that I’ve been thinking of. It was from a Catholic priest who would speak about his battles with addiction. He asked you to imagine that you had a hole in your front walkway, and almost every day you tripped when you accidentally stepped in the hole on your way out the door. What would you do? You’d fill in the damn hole. :)

That was alcohol with me. So many hangovers, dangerous decisions, fights with my spouse and embarrassing behavior.  When you look at it objectively, it’s so clear that you should fill in the damn hole.

Nearly every person there was drinking with their meal. This was my toughest moment as i was seated at  an island that looked out the window. On the other side of the glass were 2 couples eating, and each one had a sampler drink platter to themselves.  I had 2 choices,  either watch them drink or dive into my phone. I chose the latter and fortunately will be resting easier tonight for it.

Six months ago, my long term partner left me because of my drinking. We both had to move out and since I was spending all my money on going out, I ended up having to put everything I owned in a small storage unit and couch surf until I finally found my own apartment. I didn’t know how to handle the split, and since I live alone, it just fueled my drinking/other addictions that much more. There pretty much wasn’t a time where I was even slightly sober. 

Fast forward to January. I was on another wild bender and decided I would go blackout at my favorite club, justifying it “because it was Friday.” I was leaving the bar with another random potential one-night standy and was so messed up, I fell and broke my ankle. It shattered so bad, I ended up having to have surgery and stay with my parents who live 5 hours away from the city I live in. 

I just got back to my apartment after weeks of staying in my moms basement trying to heal. It hit me on my way here that I’m going to have to move back in with her back in my hometown. I’m once again having to start my life over and I’m losing it. 

I’ve been sober since the night of the fall but I’m struggling now being back here in my apartment alone. There’s two bottles of vodka in my freezer and I’m so upset I just want to drink until they’re gone. I don’t have many friends or people to reach out to so I’m just letting it all out here. 

My life has been spinning and shifting and changing since my breakup and I just want it all to stop. How do you stop from drinking yourself away? What keeps you all going?

I’m not sure why or how. Every one of these five days, I had at least one point where I had decided to get fucked up, but somewhere between making the decision and making it to the gas station for a six pack I had changed my mind. Today, I went back and forth three times within a span of fifteen minutes. Outside of work, I’ve spent the last five days profoundly alone. 

I want to pat myself on the back for being five days sober. In fact, I do pat myself on the back. I can look at myself and observe that things are getting better, my behaviors are improving. But a few layers beneath that there’s a voice that’s just screaming. This has been a very melodramatic body of text so far, so I didn’t want to put it that way. Cliches and whatnot. But that’s actually factually how it is. No matter what I’m doing at the front of my mind (so to speak), I’m screaming in the back of my mind. If I don’t keep myself busy, it becomes just paralyzing. It used to be so bad that I couldn’t sleep. Alcohol has a way of silencing the screams, and that’s why I have a problem in the first place. 

There’s a coffee grinder I want to get. It’s about $100. I’ve been telling myself that I can get it after two weeks of sobriety for about a month now. Maybe this is the one. Monday is going to be a hard one since I don’t have work Tuesday morning, and Wednesday for the same reason. Wish me luck.",5

You deserve to have a bright future if people are crappy to you because they may not be right.

You deserve to have a bright future if you’re lonely because there may be a whole bunch of people you’ve just never met who would like you.

You deserve it if you’re not good at things because you may get better at them eventually. Or you may discover a whole other set of things you’re good at.

You deserve a bright future even if you haven’t been a great person because sometimes it takes good things coming to you before you can put good things back out.

You may not see that brighter future coming but everything can change in a second. It can really be that fast, it’s been that way for me a few times. And I hope wherever you are, you believe you deserve a good future and you prepare for it because the more prepared you are for it, the better you can make things when good stuff starts to happen.

Now, obviously I was terrified of withdrawal. The stories of DT, Seizures, and depression. I will say the first day I was MORTIFIED of what would happen. But it's been a week, and thank God I'm ok. Just reading posts here have helped me too, and seeing those of you/us that are far along and years sober is incredibly inspiring. I'm using my new free time to wake up early, play videos games with my friends online again and go on long night drives to nice views. Before I'd cancel plans and shut myself in my room to drink.

It’s been a good couple of weeks. This past weekend was really busy and I was dreading parts of it all week but it actually turned out fine!     

* good friend’s kid’s 2nd birthday party. Normally I’d have 3 drinks probably to help deal with the social awkwardness of not knowing anyone and not knowing how to just be normal. Stuck to Dr Pepper and soda water. It was fun, as fun as those things can be when you don’t have any kids. 

* play date with our new puppy day care friends and their puppy, Ginger. They’re big beer people apparently and I’m still dreading the “can I get you something to drink” question. Luckily, this visit was an am visit so I came prepared with an iced coffee. I thought I was ready to slip em the I Don’t Drink but I don’t think I am. Cuz they’ll ask why. And I don’t feel I owe them a reason. Lol. I do want a more permanent reason than “I need to go running tomorrow!” Cuz I don’t want them asking again at subsequent hangouts. Maybe “I haven’t been drinking lately because of my anxiety” ? Technically the truth (then hangxiety is real) but I feel like that also makes me look weird/crazy/whatever.  Well who cares. That’s then and I only care about now.   

* husbands dads 60th birthday, we had dinner (bbq!) at their place. I was positively DREADING this one because they all drink so much and they always ask multiple times if I want a drink or why am I not drinking. My BIL always asks if I’m pregnant. It’s super uncomfortable. We stopped on the way to pick up a card and I scooped up a 6 pack of ginger beer and stuck to that and soda water all night. Amazingly not one person commented on it or offered me anything! It was odd but a welcome change from the norm lol   

I also actually got all my laundry done this time! I ran 9 miles Saturday and 5 today. I officially kick off my ultra training which is exciting. All in all a solid weekend! I’m ready to get back to work tomorrow. 🥰👏   

Hope you all had as good a weekend! Onward and upward!

I've recently cut down massively on my drinking, before 2020 I was drinking like 4+ cans a day and more on the weekend with no alcohol-free days and kept this up for like 2 years due to being young and having a stressful job at the time. I finally realised at the end of 2019 that I cant keep doing this... I'm 24 and although I might get away with it now my health is going to eventually suffer so I decided to make a new years resolution to not quit but at least half my drinking. Since then I've cut down quite a lot, I have 2-3 alcohol-free days a week now typically and only drink like 1 can a day now, on weekends I may have 3-4 which I still get annoyed about sometimes if it's not an occasion.

I want to cut down more but I find it hard to resist the temptation when I'm in shops, once I get the idea in my head I want a beer I cant get it out until I give into temptation. It's pretty pathetic but how do you resist that urge? I'm hopeful some of you can relate.",6

I did quit between about April 2018 and June 2018, but a stressor kicked it back off.  I worked back up in a hurry and averaged 12-15 beers a day for most of that time.  But, the past few months, things have sort of changed slowly.  It occurred to me last week that I was really drinking out of habit...not so much out of stress anymore.  

I stopped.  I did crave some the next couple days.  Then I got some weird strep sort of thing, so that has made most of the time distracted by feeling like hell.  I knew from last time I quit I didn't have much of any issue with withdrawal, and I didn't have really anything this time, which is sort of miraculous.

I had dealt with a few come and go medical issues from drinking.  Hearing loss, high BP, random pains, breathing issues, neuropathy, and lately facial flushing and throat swelling.  Interestingly I think that I really had a long term minor throat infection and the alcohol was making it worse, but also keeping the bacteria at bay due to minor antiseptic properties...and when I quit that antiseptic thing stopped, hence the illness...can't confirm that, but....  I was tired of it all so much.  I was functional, but...killing myself.  

I have noticed a minor bit of reduction in facial swelling and I just sort of feel like my gut is less swollen.  The scale says a couple pounds down, but it overall feels like 10.  I honestly have a good outlook.  I think I know that I have dealt with the worst in life.  I see benefits from not drinking now.

The song is about an alcoholic who is sitting at a bar drinking a Coke because if he drinks alcohol he can’t stop drinking. The chorus goes “the more I drink the more I drink”.

A significant portion of the audience raised giant beers and swayed along, acting like this was a song about how great it is to be a drinker. 

It was an incredibly sad moment for me, and one in which I realized how far outside the drinking “matrix” I am. I felt so sorry for those people who thought they needed alcohol to have fun or to be a true fan.

I've been sober for one month and a week now and my desire for drinking is finally dwindling.

I smiled back, thinking to myself that he needed the same kind of help that I am currently getting. When I got my groceries, I saw another old guy behind me requesting a bottle of hard liquor from the shelves behind the cashier. I felt as though the whole world was drunk and for a moment, I realised that these people could've been me in some years.

If I hadn't realised that I needed help, I would most likely had ended up like these two old dudes.
I would have been the one making a fool of myself in front of the cashier and other customers with my drunken remarks and attitude.
I could have ended up alone on a Sunday, buying beers and hard liquir for no other reason than wanting to destroy myself.

I'm resetting my badge after a period of drinking more than I'd like.  I've had previous bouts of sobriety lasting years; and somewhere along the way I started having a few beers / drinks around friends and family.

I'd previously stopped drinking after a tragic bout of alcoholism that almost cost me my job.  That lasted for 2.5 years.  It was a great time, and a sober time.  The main reason I wanted to quit drinking (funny enough) was so that I would quit smoking.  Now that I've been casually drinking again for a few years I've begun to bum cigarettes at bars.

I know the warning signs, and I'm starting to feel like things could get bad if I keep casually drinking - so I'm deciding to pull the plug or cork the bottle before things get out of hand.  Not sure how long this will last, but I'm not going to drink today.  I want this to last for a bit so I can fully sober up and re-assess things.

I have friends, and next month I'll be moving in with 3 good roommates in a house, I'm nervous because they all drink. At the very least I want 1 month under my belt.

I know I've isolated myself to be sober, and it's my fault, but I'm really sad and lonely right now. I have a good support group, but I'm feeling depressed and last night I was very close to slipping. This is worth doing right?

I know this is a long post, but I have to talk about this. I (32m) graduated college 7 years ago, I have never had a run in with the law.

I'm trying to stay motivated to accomplish my goals, but right now I dont feel like I'll ever do anything, like I'm just fooling myself, and sobriety wont matter if I am the loser that I feel like today.

Yall are always supportive, and I know this is just a whiney ""woe is me"" post. Thank you all for sharing your stories and helping to open my eyes about alcohol.

It was the fifth anniversary of my mother's passing a few days ago. I was on my usual trap, vodka and whatever I had in the fridge to mix it. Come morning I find most of the 750 gone, vomit on my stove, and half a jar of peanut butter consumed.

This scene was not uncommon in my life. I work a high stress job and get home late to a cold, lonely apartment in the middle of nowhere. My friends are all going to bed right when I open my door, and I have another four or five hours to kill before I need to be in bed. Four or five nights out of the week I'd mosey over to a gas station, get another 750, and chip away at it all night. All alone in my apartment and in the dark.

Drunk me is just an id. Full of wants. I'd go around buying all sorts of things I didn't need, but felt I needed in the moment. I'd go on Facebook and fawn over attractive people, people I missed a chance with, or people I felt like I lorded over after high school. A few times I sent some drunk texts, other times I sent some unsavory Snapchats. Many a morning did I awake to some difficult stuff on my phone, leading me to search through all of my history and chats to delete what shame there was.

The shame would sit with me through the day while I sifted through the hangover sludge. Does everyone hate me now? Am I going to cause problems for myself at work? Did I hurt somebody?Thankfully, I have good friends at work, and by quitting time most of my fears would have been washed away by the laughs and concentration I had at work.

Then I'm driving home, anticipating that cold, lonely apartment, and I think about that friend I have.

I suppose there's much more to it than that, but this is the main cycle I'm seeking to break. I can't feel anxious all the time. I can't keep bombarding my body. I can't keep putting my livelihood and relationships at risk. It feels like I keep swinging a loaded pistol over my feet, and I want to be free of that. I think I'm going to reach out to some friends this week and tell them what's been going on. It's largely been a secret, and it shouldn't be.

What strikes me the most is the day I'm choosing to start this. Alcoholism runs in the family. It nearly wrecked my parents' marriage and made us disown my unruly aunt. When my mom was dying, she asked me to not go down the same route. I told her I wouldn't, and today I'm standing by it.

I'm an alcoholic, but I'll get better. I planted some flowers today, and I'm looking forward to some hot tea and a blanket in my cold apartment tonight.

The first 30 were easy, and up to 45 even, but I've found I've had a lot of stress with work, and a lot more social invites the last 2 weeks. Plus a few odd cravings for champagne (which I never really drank??)

I wish I could say I've experienced the pink cloud, or that things have massively improved - but they haven't. What has changed is:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my nearly constant anxiety is more a few times a week rather than several times a day. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't wake up bloated or blurry ever. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am proud of being able to go out and not drink. I was very scared of caving under the pressure. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've lost about 6lbs 

But, I find it hard to socialise, as I did rely on work drinks, etc to make friends for so long. I am often a bit bored or miss that feeling of something to look forward to as a reward.

When those results came back I got a very stern talking to by the doctor. He was pissed off. My results yesterday were twice over the limit meaning my tolerance was so high I could easily get to 5 times over the limit where most people would die.

It made me fun. As someone who is really anxious, alcohol was a way to quiet the noise. When I was younger, it was viewed as funny and fun because most of the people around me were drinking to excess too. We would bond over the “you’ll never believe what I did last night” stories. However, over the past couple of years it seems that I am becoming the only one who still acts that way.

My drinking has put me into many risky situations. Once I’m drunk, I want to talk to everyone and will frequently separate from the friends I went out with. I am more willing to smoke cigarettes and, occasionally, try substances. Luckily, I haven’t seriously hurt myself or gotten arrested...yet. 

Recently, I have been dating someone who doesn’t drink. When I’m drunk I will start fights with him. I feel I have a free pass to say whatever I want when I am drunk. In the past, other boyfriends I have had also drank so we both wouldn’t remember much of the argument. But now, having someone to hold a sober mirror to me and make me see how I am acting has brought to light how horrible it is.

On Friday, I went out with friends for happy hour at 4 and proceeded to stay out drinking until 11:30. I, once again,separated from my group and had to Uber home alone. Waking up on Saturday at 6:30 am, unable to sleep, barely able to keep down water, and with numerous mean text messages to own up to I finally decided enough is enough.

I want yesterday to be the last time I experience the crippling anxiety of realizing that I am losing an entire day of a weekend because I am hungover. 

When I’ve tried to quit before, friends have told me “just cut back!” I’m ready to admit to myself that “just cutting back” doesn’t work for me. The next drink isn’t going to be different. So today I pledge to not drink.",5

This past weekend, I agreed to a few social plans after spending the majority of my weekends alone or with my family for the past few months. I went out Friday to something with people I didn't know who were all drinking, though not excessively and it wasn't a booze fest. The whole thing left me feeling hollow, uncomfortable, and resentful of spending time and money on yet another awkward time that I had to pretend to enjoy. 

I ended up canceling Saturday plans after feeling insanely anxious and tempted to drink that morning. I hate being a flake, but I just couldn't take the risk. Then, last night, I also found out that my sister relapsed on coke, as she called me high in the middle of the night. I just feel wrecked and exhausted. 

I have started realizing how much my social anxiety triggers an overwhelming desire to drink (or take/find drugs), but spending so much time solo lately has also started to make me like a failure for not getting out there and 'living life.' 
I guess I'm just struggling with maintaining sobriety vs fighting feelings of anxiety / low self worth. 

How long did it take you to get back out there in the world? Wether it be dating, making new friends, finding new hobbies, etc. I've gotten back into exercising, my financial situation has turned around and my professional career is in a better place than it's been in years since I have up booze. But the guilt of saying no to plans and being a 'failure' are starting to get to me. Anyone experience something similar? Is it wrong to spend months mostly alone as long as it keeps me sober?

I was sipping my coffee outside, smoking a cigarette this morning and my neighbor walks out with his dogs and tells me he’s hungover. And I was like that all the time. I get celebrating with a drink but now that I’m sober I have to celebrate with other things and with that in mind I feel like I’m fully celebrating something instead of muting my emotions with a drink. Like emotions are real. They’re good, they’re bad, they’re meh. But they’re real and I love feeling everything good and bad. I have control now. I just feel kind of sorry that even though I consider my friends to not have a drinking problem the first thing they run to to have a good time or to celebrate an accomplishment is with alcohol.

I left my home and my gf in persue of a never ending party. I get that in my head when I drink, I think I'll just go to a bar and the party wont end - oh what fun. 
Any kind of badness in my normal sober life triggers me to drink and I will eventually end up dead. 
4 years ago I got so drunk that I ended up in a mans car (he said he would take me home) the man then drove to an abandoned shore and raped and robbed me. After this he left me for dead naked from the waist down. It scared me so much that I didn't drink for two years but I think I might have PTSD because I cant deal with normal life the same as before so I drink and do coke to get out of my head. 
My gf has left me because she believes I have cheated whilst I've been out and I cant convince her that i was just chasing a high like an idiot. 
So I've decided it's time to face the music, deal with my feelings and stay sober. I've been on this sub  for a while because it's always been on my agenda to give up and I hope that I can use this group to help me in this journey.

I felt this deep sadness that I was saying goodbye to this wonderful thing that made me and my friends so happy.

I'm currently on the tail end of a weekend trip with three of my closest friends that I found myself dreading. What if they badger me with questions about why I'm not drinking? Will they think I am weird? Am I even gonna have fun at all? 

So far all of my anxieties have been proven gloriously wrong. I'm writing this Sunday morning (completely HANGOVER FREE) feeling so much gratitude.

Not drinking hasn't stopped me from taking all our dogs on a beautiful walk, talking and reminiscing. 

Not drinking has not stopped me from getting all dressed up for a nice dinner/night out, helping each other with hair and makeup like we were in college again. 

Not drinking didn't stop me from dancing to 90s hip hop last night and being the designated picture taker for the night ( one of my favorite tasks). Gossiping and laughing about the people around us.

I know this is getting long but if anyone reading this is is holding on to drinking because they are afraid or sad at the thought of giving up fun with friends, it's a lie Alcohol is trying to tell you. 

I repeat: it's a lie Alcohol is trying to tell you.

I threw up when I was lying in bed often and my parents cleaned up after me. About half a year ago, I had my worst night. I drank about half a litre of about 20% alcohol in a couple of minutes, when I was already drunk as hell. This was the second last night with my friends and my girlfriend before I was going to University in another City, >400km away from my home. I don't remember, what happened after that last drink but when I woke up the next day, I found out. Somebody drove me home and I threw up nearly everywhere in my parents house and my parents cleaned up after me. My girlfriend broke up with me, because I behaved so bad that night and even threw up on her pants when she held me and cared for me. She later told me, that my dad said, when I came home and did all that, that he is happy that I am leaving the next days. That hit me so hard and was a big wakeup call for me. I realised that I messed up so badly and often. When I arrived at the other city, I still drank but not that much when I went out partying. The problem then was, that I didn't study in the weekends because of hannovers. 
But I turned my life around and also have my girlfriend back since some months and I've quit some bad habits in the last months, including drinking. I will not drink again, it just destroys everything I have and everything I care about. 
I feel so ashamed for my behavior, because normally I am a healthy and happy young guy and always care for my girlfriend, but alcohol always changed me and made me aggressive and do bad things.
My life is much better now and I know, that if I ever go back to drinking on the weekends when I go out, I will have a blackout again and have messed up again.
I will do this and this community here helped me a lot, the last parties I went to I didn't drink.
I wish you all a great successful week!",6

Then we went to another bar and I was completely triggered by the situation and I’m not even sure what happened, but all of a sudden I was sullen and seething mad, calling him names, told him to just leave me there (we were 1.5 hours from home!!). 

He ended up taking me home, but I was yelling at him the whole way. I’m not looking for sympathy, I know I’m the one in the wrong here. I’m so afraid he’s going to break up with me this time.

As theres no stag I decided it would be a good idea to crash for a few hours. 

The hen party was about 30 strong. By the time I showed up they were singing karaoke and all in good spirits. I had driven up to Glasgow so that temptation wasnt easily given into. However, there was none. 

I drink some.cobra zero most of the night. I sang karaoke sober. I stayed with them as we moved onto a club. They didnt have any non-alcoholic drink, so a red bull and a can of irn bru in my hand still made me feel included. I danced like I'd had a drink. Because in my head I thought I had to be drunk to get up and enjoy myself like I did. 

I done this entirely sober. For the first time since I was about 16/17, I'm 34, I sang in public (I'm terrible), I went to a club and I danced like no one was watching. I actually enjoyed the night and I've woke up this morning with none of the usual side effects from a night out.

This was a lengthy story so if you made it here, thanks for listening. I'm feeling immensely positive about sobriety now. As I said, this is more significant than any number of days. Sorry, but I'm really proud of myself on a number of levels.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi everyone, and happy Sunday! My intention into this Sunday is to give myself the rest I need to recharge before the week ahead. By slowing down and keeping it simple, my mind, body and spirit can be replenished. Without intentionally pausing on the weekend, I can sometimes spin into a frenzy by midweek and then become bitter towards the self-created chaos. I sure hope I am not alone in that, but boy, my midweek attitude is not something I enjoy if I don't rest on Sundays! So, if you'd like to share how you keep it simple, whether it be intentionally on Sundays or anytime throughout your week, I'd love to hear from you.

Then being disappointed when things inevitably get out of control and starting over again. 

I know that moderation isn't going to work for what I want out of life and I am the only person who can break this cycle.  It seems when things start to improve without alcohol, that long held beliefs that drinking is such a fundamental part of life start to creep back in.  It's almost as though the pain it has previously caused has lost its vividness. 

I am now a father which has given me more motivation and drive than ever before to kick alcohol for good.  I want to be the role model to my daughter that I didnt have growing up.  I'm hopeful that each set back has been getting me closer to achieving this.  

Would be interested in the perspectives of others who also battle with this ongoing shift in mindset.

 I lurked here for a long time and had a bad physical addiction to alcohol after being a heavy drinker -10-20 a day for decades.  The DT's were so strong I just drank to maintain, to feel normal, I didn't crave it at all, but still had to drink myself to sleep in order to operate the next day. The fear of quitting was mostly the fear of going through withdrawl, it's a miserable feeling and it goes on all day every day until you get that poison in your blood stream and you start to feel normal again. I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be like that. If you need to quit and you want to quit, go explain this to your doctor and ask for a short dose of librium. 2 days of no DT's, maybe one more for good measure, you still have crazy dreams and cold sweats while sleeping, but its nothing like going through the day waiting for that drink to make you feel normal again. You can detox at home. Drink as close to a gallon of water per day you can and your muscles come back in days. The whites of your eyes are visible again on day 2 or 3. Don't tough this out, it only leads to giving in. Don't be ashamed to ask your MD for help. It worked for me a year ago then out of bore dome I relapsed, DT's kicked in again and I needed a fresh supply. I'm not counting the days, cause today is all that matters, but I'm telling you it works magic. Good luck to all of you and thanks for being here for me.",8

As a bonus, out of 9 people at dinner, only two drank. If I had still of been drinking I guarantee that we would have been at least two bottles of wine and some beers in since at least one other person at the dinner tends to socially drink.

I should feel grateful, but today I wanted to escape from it. It’s why I used to drink.  Because being is just hard sometimes. 

Tomorrow morning I’ll wake up and know I made the right decision.  I’m trying to stay grateful that at least I KNOW now that drinking wasn’t helping. I wasn’t escaping, I was numbing. Knowing that I can do life without booze.  Booze won’t make anything easier or more fun. All my problems (plus some new ones) will be here when I sober up.

It got harder and harder to stay away from it, and I started developing some concerning drinking behaviours (drinking alone, hiding my drinking from friends/family, always getting drunk when I did drink) which finally made me decide to give it up altogether.

I sort of want to go to AA, partly because I really feel like I would benefit from having a sponsor to talk to (even well meaning friends who are really supportive of me don’t quite “get it”). However, I don’t feel like I’m alcoholic enough. I only drank for a few years of my life and never more than a few times a week. It didn’t get to the point of making me broke, or losing my job, or destroying my relationships or anything like that. I’d drink most weekends to get drunk and that was the extent of it. So I don’t feel like I was in deep enough to qualify for AA... can anyone relate or advise?",9

I come in here and lurk from time to time which helps. Thanks so much for everyone's openness and honesty. 

And now, I am absolutely loving the results I've seen. 

I traded drinking a 6 pack and staying up too late for getting up at 4:30 am workouts. I ran a triathlon in the mountains. Took work more seriously and found a new job (with 2x the salary). I eat better. I feel better. 

I am better. 

I just got back from a wedding with some pretty heavy drinking involved. After the reception, I woke up at 5:45 am and ran up and down Seattle's hills while everyone slept in. I cooked everyone breakfast and looked like a freakin' superhero because I wasn't hungover. 

I can't express this enough for anyone who needs to hear it: If you find yourself thinking ""maybe I should cut back"" that means you definitely should. If you told me 365 days ago that I would be here, I would have laughed, said ""cheers,"" and drank to your health. 

Now, I'm crushing it. Like I said, don't upvote this one yet. I'll be back to celebrate on Tuesday :)",3

I just realized my cake day (Dec. 8th 2019) was my quit day. I don't remember doing this intentionally.

Here I am, Feb 22nd 2020 still completely alcohol free. I was reading my old journals while getting into re-binding a while back, and I kept finding so many entries (going back to 2014) wherein I'm swearing off alcohol, talking about awful drunken incidents I created, or writing inspirational plans and anecdotes about not drinking/other people I know or read about who do not drink.

I'm really glad I finally did it. Every couple days I face a bit of a challenge, but I keep going, and every time I get over the hump I am so grateful to still be alcohol free. IWNDWYT  

Edit to say, I just noticed this sub's birthday is Dec 9th, so that's close enough to be a very cool coincidence!",9

I won't bore you with personal details or my ""Story"" I'm mainly here to share and hopefully help someone, even one person, make it to a year of sobriety.  Many people will disagree with some of my advice, but this is how I have gotten and stayed sober.  Just a reminder, alcoholism is progressive and fatal, so if it keeps you sober and is not self harm, then do it.  

Here's what I've learned so far on my Journey:

#1 Ignore people that are calling you a dry drunk or tell you that you need to go to AA and put all the focus on how much of an alcoholic you are.  If you aren't drinking, you're winning.  As long as you're winning you can tell these people to fuck off.  Keep winning.

#2 Avoid triggers (at least to begin with)

Triggers are a very real thing, if you have a group of drinking buddies you're going to need to stay away from them at least until you can go several weeks without thinking about drinking.  Bars?  Nope.  You're not going for a while.  You need to stay away from any situation where you would normally drink until you establish the habit of NOT drinking.  Expecting to avoid bar/restaurants or social events for the rest of your life where alcohol is served is unrealistic.

#3 Avoid Boredom

In relation to number 2, Boredom can be a massive trigger.  You have to find something productive to do with your time, addicts are wired primarily to seek out constant stimulation, you should seek out that stimulation in healthy ways.  This ties into....

#4 Find a hobby and sober acquaintances

It's important to reconsider who you spend time with, I'm not saying to get rid of your old friends, I see mine on the regular but I also go to Jiu-jitsu to do an activity that doesn't revolve around alcohol.  Some hobbies you could pick up to occupy your time include learning a Musical Instrument, Playing/Collecting Videogames, woodworking, metalworking, art, martial arts, dance, weight lifting, working on cars, starting a side business, etc...  Things that will have you socializing in a way that doesn't revolve around alcohol.  That ties nicely into...

#5 Accept your social life is going to change

You will probably not be going out every weekend during your initial months of sobriety, your life that revolved around getting drunk with friends is now going to change, but it's all for the better I promise.  You'll have to learn to navigate social situations and make friends without the social lubricant that is alcohol, but it's doable.  Find interest groups in your area, go to meetups, look for events that don't revolve around alcohol, or if you're an introvert, just relax stay at home and pop on some netflix.  Either way, you're life will be different.

#6 Don't view yourself as a helpless alcoholic

There's a lot of ""admit you have no power over alcohol"" bs floating around.  It's a partial truth in that you have no power over alcohol once you start consuming it.  Just remember, there's no such thing as ""Just one beer or just a taste"" Fuck that, not one drop of liquor is going into your body, and you just keep telling yourself as long as I don't touch it, I have power over it, but if I take even one sip, I'm in serious trouble. 

#7 CBD can help

For me one of the hardest parts of quitting drinking was the anxiety, holy shit it was crushing.  What I found really and truly helped was CBD.  The Jury is still out on this, but Anxiety is a MASSIVE trigger and if you want to stay sober you'll need to do something about it.  If you've got the money, by all means go see a doctor, but if not try to find ways to relieve your anxiety.  Personally CBD does the trick for me.

#8 If one method isn't working try a different one

By all means if this guide isn't working for you, try a different one, if that one doesn't work try something different.  Keep trying until you find a way that works.

Some things I Do and don't do:

On the rare occasion I'm out at a bar for lunch or sitting by a bonfire, sometimes I have a non-alcoholic beer.  I really don't recommend this for most people, but I've found that for the most part my desire to drink in social situations comes from not wanting to feel left out, it helps quite nicely too when I want some with my wings.  That said I can probably count on one hand the number of these I consume in a year.  Again, I don't recommend this, but I feel it has helped me, your mileage may vary.

I don't go to AA nor have I ever been, I don't actively focus on not drinking and have my lifestyle be that of ""Recovering Alcoholic"", this post came about from a discussion with my wife who works at a rehab, I wanted to be able to share some knowledge with those people but obviously I can't just walk into a place like that so I figured I'd post here instead.  I focus on keeping busy and just not consuming alcohol, that's it, no meetings, no self help books, none of that.

I don't ""Test"" myself.  If I have friends over and they want to drink that's fine by me, I've told them if any of them were ever to hand me a beer I'd beat the life out of them, and equally If I ever ask one they get to punch me in the face.  I don't ""test"" this theory and when they leave they take the booze with them.  Should they forget and I see it any alcohol I find goes straight in the garbage.  No ""saving"" it in case someone else comes over or any of that bs.  STRAIGHT IN THE TRASH.  No keeping booze in your house, if you have an SO, they need to respect that too, or you need to find a new SO.

I Do constantly keep myself busy, my current hobbies are woodworking, jiu-jitsu, restoring an old car, video game collecting, weight lifting, playing the cello (poorly), and running a side business along with a full time job.  KEEP BUSY.

I don't count the days.  To me counting days just means you're treating it like how long you can go before you fuck up.  I'm just sober, I just don't drink, it doesn't matter how many days, I just made a decision to be done with it and now I've stuck with it.

I Do get cravings, I'm not perfect, I've had one close call in 4 years, but it gets easier and easier as time goes on.  The first month is the hardest, it gets easier after that.

Anywho that's all I got for a knowledge bomb to drop on you.  If you've got questions or need help or ideas, feel free to comment below.",206

I'm working out my student loans, applied to grad school, and feel at peace in almost all aspects of my life. My one year sobriety lands on Easter and I'm not a religious person but the symbolism  is fitting. There were times I thought my life was over through this. Even times I WANTED it to be over but today I am grateful (something I would hear in meetings and roll my eyes at in my early months).

She sells clothes and was having a party--muffins, mimosas, clothes to try on and put in an order. I was gobsmacked by how badly I wanted to have something--but not at her house. At my own house later that day. I didn't drink at her house though, and when I went to buy groceries I did 2 smart things: I stopped at home first and got my kid to come with me so I wouldn't buy any. He has never seen me drunk and knows I drink wine ""every now and then"" (I hide the full amount from my family and it's pretty much been contained to weekends, but that's neither here nor there). For me though, buying wine after my commitment to myself not to drink and to do it in front of him would be doubly wrong. And I also thought actually to what that wine would taste like, how bloaty it would make me feel, and how fuzzy. And I didn't drink. I admit I have all kinds of thoughts of ""I can make it 30 days and then I can drink at a party or make a plan to go out with because then I will have it under control."" But as long as I'm thinking about when I can drink again then I'm not in control, drink is. I got Day 7 in my rearview mirror, had a clear, good day with my family, and I'm not going to think about 30 days. Just tomorrow. Have a great night everyone, and thanks for being here. IWNDWYT",5

I was asked to come back when done with work and hang out for the weekend. So I drove through the canyon into the valley and found myself morph back to the person I thought I had left behind.

I tried to cut straight through to the mountains and lose myself in the redwoods but I couldn’t make it that far as the sadness and fear overwhelmed me, as it all came flooding back triggered by being in the physical place where I experienced a lot of trauma, where my toxic relationship ended, where I lost the home that I built and fought so hard to keep, where the PTSD episodes began, and where I began to head into a darkness so dark I almost didn’t make it out. That familiar toxic voice returned, I was overwhelmed with loneliness and pain: my heart was ripped from my chest and I couldn’t breathe.

Was near Apple HQ.. Managed to book a hotel room - full service - boutique kind, some association with a winery and brewery, they boasted. I was in such a state that I was stuttering and about to melt down as I checked in with the front desk 2 hrs before normal time - muttering about how I need quiet and chocolate cake. 

They upgraded my room to the top floor - a rare corner suite with breath-taking views of the Mountains and Silicon Valley.

I climbed into bed, turned on PBS, took my meds, and breathed through it. I immediately checked the room service menu : not generally a luxury I allow myself. The wine jumped off the page at me.. I *KNOW* I was looking for and could have my oblivion with that bottle of wine. 

An unexpected knock on the door:

The concierge had sent someone to the gourmet bakery down the street and bought me a gigantic piece of chocolate cake.

It was only then that I began to cry.

I almost threw it all away on a bottle of wine - back to my old habits.

Tomorrow I will go into my beloved hills and lose myself amongst the trees and mountain lions, and find my oblivion there, as it should be.

I had gotten to where I thought I had this not drinking thing nailed: wasn’t counting days anymore. Today is a reminder of the work ahead: Still don’t have the PTSD under control.

I think my solution is self-love but honestly I don't know how to love myself..","After giving this years of thought I finally came to this conclusion. I'm in my 30's now and have a lot of PTSD to emotional trauma I had to deal with that started from a very young age.

I realize now that I have blocked most of these issues as a defense mechanism but the scars are still there and even though I try to forget about the past it's clear in the way I approach life and I'm sure this can apply to everybody.

Drinking is my go to addiction to feel good and turn off the negative thoughts in my head but I struggle with other things as well like food, internet, caffine etc. I'm always looking for ways to escape how I'm feeling.

When I do manage to string a couple of days together it feels like so much effort to try and feel ""normal"" and it usually is followed by a worse relapse.

If anybody can relate to this or has overcome these feelings I'm all ears! I do sometimes feel ""normal"" but it's usually when im so busy with work I don't have time to think.",26

When I lived in California, where I could purchase legal marijuana in a store, I almost never had to go without. Sure, there were the days I stayed at my mom’s house, or the times I was traveling. But these times weren’t very regular. 

However, now that I live in a US state where marijuana is a illegal, there are many times where I do not have weed. During these times, I find myself longing for the feeling of being stoned. I get anxious and irritable if I can’t smoke. Essentially, I feel like my mind and body are so used to being stoned, that when I do not have it, I crave it. This is becoming a huge barrier to my desire to stop drinking. 

Oftentimes I find myself turning to alcohol when I cannot get my hands on weed. I love getting stoned. It is my second favorite thing in the world (my fiancé is the first). She likes to smoke too, but can take it or leave it. She is the same way with alcohol. 

Now i feel like I understand what people in AA talk about when they say we need to be completely sober. Weed is a substitute for alcohol, and when I can’t smoke, alcohol becomes a substitute for weed. 

I’m getting married tomorrow. I have family in town. I cannot smoke weed at the moment and I do not have any. However, because alcohol is sold everywhere, I can always get a drink. This is a nerve wracking time for me, and I’m back to old behavior of sneaking drinks when nobody is looking. 

I think this time in my life is going to make me rethink my relationship with marijuana.",10

So for quite a long time I've been stress drinking.  While work is somewhat stressful I've been quite successful and I could handle it.  The real main culprit IMO has been the slowly deteriorating relationship with my wife.  Two years ago I stepped down from a pretty promising mgmt track at work ... I was managing 4 teams around the globe and was working way too much and traveling frequently.  I was losing touch with my wife and kids and I wasn't okay with that.  

We spent the last two years experiencing ups and downs but never really managed to recapture the relationship we used to have.  I focused as much as I could on the kids but my wife was an enigma, I never knew how to talk to her anymore.  I was stress drinking and drinking to not think.  The fam would go to bed early and I'd just polish off a half bottle or so of something 80 proof (i took to buying half 375ml bottles as a way to artificially limit myself) several days a week. I felt like I needed it to forget and so that I could fall asleep.  Three weeks ago she said she wanted a divorce and that really, really sucked.  I was just so tired of fighting her, fighting for her, that I agreed...and started the process.  I found some healing through focusing on the process itself.  We absolutely worked together to keep things amicable and not affect the kids so that was nice.

A week ago we had a giant  breakthrough and things are wonderful between us right now, almost like old times.  I'm an overcommunicator and problem solver and she's the exact opposite...but she opened up to me emotionally again and even agreed to get help with her anxiety and what I feel like is undiagnosed depression.  I'd asked her for years to do this.  She's following through her words with deeds and I'm as happy as I've been in a long time.  Years.

It's my turn to get my head right.  I need to drop drinking, or at least get it under strict control (I would say that I'm a frequent binge drinker).   I feel like I could do it myself given time but I want to really get a jump on it and I feel like I need the help of those that have been there/done that/helped others out. 

I was thinking a week in an inpatient rehab facility might be the ticket to dropkick me into getting my mind right.   That would remove all opportunity for me to say ""hey it's cool"" and give in to temptation.  

Thoughts and advice?  Thank you all in advance.",2

As many times as I tried in my younger years, I never felt connected to Christianity. I actually grew to almost despise it. My husband and I are alike in this, but he has always been interested in Jewish ideals and I am getting to a point in my life where I'm looking to find meaning in more than just the surface of things, spiritually or otherwise. 

I was originally going to just drive him to the service and get some work done in the car. He dressed up, as he wasn't sure what the normal dress is. When we pulled up, we noticed everyone going into the synagogue was very casually dressed, so I offered to go with him in my sweatshirt, leggings, and tennis shoes. I felt a warmth and calmness throughout the service, following along with the readings of the Torah. 

The lessons were very humanistic and all-encompassing, even without thinking about the religious aspect of it all. It felt kind of like therapy.
I held my husband's hand and tried my best to sing the translated Hebrew songs. I felt grounded and centered. Towards the close of the service, everyone was invited to come up and ""take communion."" I'm not sure of the term for it in the Jewish faith, so please forgive my ignorance. But it looked to me to be the same sort of thing as Christian communion. Each person drank a medicine cup of wine and a blessing was read. 

The passage that was read gave such reverence to wine. For a moment, I felt myself romanticizing it, as I have many other times in my life. I wanted to be a part of this, just for a moment. But I knew if I chose to take part, it would inevitably lead to more wine at home. Which would inevitably lead to waking up feeling terrible and without any of the warm feelings I felt last night. So instead of waking up hungover and miserable, I'm clear-headed and able to reflect on this new experience. Apologies for rambling, just wanted to share.

I have been out hiking a lot the last couple of days (it's been great out where I live) and reflected on my sober time and everything that got me here.  The biggest thing I have noticed is this year felt 99% the same as my 3rd year sober. The year-to-year change has dropped off almost completely for me it seems.

I remember during the first two years for me a lot of rapid change happened. The only real difference between this and last year for me with how I relate to sobriety was me being a bit more social. I went out to the bar a couple times with writing groups and friends and am slowly getting used more used to being around people drinking. Beside that year 4 felt almost exactly like year 3. I guess this sort of leveling off makes since, the most dramatic change is in the first year.

Anyway, hope everyone has a great sober weekend. And for anyone starting out, getting to the place mentally where you are fully ready to quit is half the battle. Don't let relapses and setback get you down, you can do it!",41

When will I learn?,"I was doing good this last round of abstinence. I logged 45 days, beginning on Dec 1st. But only 11 days into my new-found sobriety I broke my foot and was stuck at home, unable to get to meetings in person. A couple of months later, my foot felt good enough to venture out into the neighborhood again. By then I had completely let my guard down and had forgotten all about why I had stopped drinking.

""Why not celebrate my return to almost-normalcy with a nice cocktail??""

Sure, the first couple days it was two drinks and done, with no accompanying desire to get drunk or escape. I maybe even had a day here or there without drinking. I told myself I wouldn't keep booze at home, wouldn't drink at home alone, wouldn't drink to escape, etc. But of course that didn't last long. Last Saturday I spent the morning with my head in the toilet and felt the pain of regret at hurting someone very close to me by my actions. I've been back to daily drinking, to the point where a couple of days ago I felt like having only three beers in a day was a non-drinking day. I've noticed that I plan my time with non-drinking friends in a way that enables me to go drink on my own, and I get irritated if they want to hang outside of planned events because it will mess up my beer time. Yesterday, I had 8 drinks and didn't even feel drunk/buzzed (two margaritas at lunch, a beer at home, a happy hour cocktail, a beer with friends, two glasses of wine, and another cocktail).

The writing is on the f\*cking wall, man. This poison is stealing my life and my $$ away from me.

It isn’t wise giving someone advice like this. Weed and mushrooms aren’t suitable for a lot of people. These drugs still have major side effects. Weed actually makes me feel lethargic and depressed the next day and I ALWAYS want a beer when I’m stoned.

I mentioned this earlier in this sub - I’m very close to someone who experimented with mushrooms and afterwards they had to spend two months in a Psychiatric hospital because of it. They’ve been a heavy drinker since (they wasn’t a drinker before).

She basically fumed about how stupid she was to think I'd follow through, and was silent when I explained my position. 

It's strange being on this side of sobriety, identifying the victim role of someone who has had a very long, deep-seated, even more toxic relationship with alcohol than I have. I used to feel that her pity parties were always my fault, as she used to blame me for the fallout of our friendship, and apparently still does. In reality, I've always pushed myself to achieve bigger things, but she never has, and I think she feels ensnared in her own web she's spun for herself. I can finally feel free of that responsibility to help her claw her way out of every funk, take initiative to show that I care by relentlessly inviting her to get together through the years despite her innumerable failures to commit or follow through, and be fully unapologetic in my resolve to put my sobriety above all other priorities.

If I spent decades improperly associating alcohol with the positive results and by doing so have trained my subconscious to default to the drinking whenever I need that “boost” or “relief” then it begs the question why can’t it work in the opposite direction. Consciously condition my mind with the real affects of alcohol and how it is a destructive force that hurts me and the ones around me, then with time and repetition, it stands to reason that instead of my subconscious telling me that alcohol will give me relief it will instead be a red flag when I’m offered a drink or when I’m looking for a way to handle a stressful situation. 

It’s logical that with constant almost habitual reminders of the the negative affects of alcohol and associating the positive feelings with sobriety ( better sleep, better health, improved relationships, Etc.) that the auto response to default to alcohol can be turned to an auto response to be repulsed buy it. Retraining the brain. 

Sure, it’s not a silver bullet and won’t provide instant relief for a bad day or a craving in the beginning, but as a conscious long term strategy to be aware of and work towards along with the support networks, community and therapy etc.

I was tired of the stress, anxiety, and malaise.  I was tired of the sleepless nights, the hangovers, upset stomach, the sweats, the shakes...the disappointment in myself when I bought beers even when I truly didn't want to.

On that morning 1000 days ago my daughter, 3 at the time, walked into my room and wanted me to wake up.  My hangover was bad and instead of treating my child like the little bundle of joy she is, I snapped at her.  Why couldn't she understand that 6am isn't the time to run into my room and want to play when daddy had 10 beers the night before - she's an asshole.  Wait a minute... the 3 year old isn't the asshole here, Dad, it's you.  

After mom and the little one went to work and school I sat down and checked my online bank statement.  Uh-oh, where did all the money go?  I looked back over the 30 days of transactions in front of me and made a shocking discovery.  The money went to this bar, and that bar, and the micorbrewery, the liquor store... pretty much everywhere but where it should have been going like paying down debts, buying healthy meals for my family, savings, etc.  I felt like a complete failure.  Most of my stresses in life had to deal with my lack of money.  Truth is, I didn't have a lack of money, but I was spending it on self medicating through alcohol.  

I made a post here and then texted my wife to let her know I was done drinking and I meant it.  Over the next couple of months I went to AA meetings and attended some SMART meetings online.  I read posts here every morning and any time I needed the support.  I am forever grateful for the tools that I have been able to place into my sobriety tool box and try to share some of my thoughts/experiences here in hopes to help others.  Helping others and sharing my experiences help me stay committed to my sobriety and keep me grounded.  

After 1000 hangover free days I can confidently say that my life is so much better today than it was 1001 days ago.  Is it perfect?  No.  Do I get stressed and have thoughts about having a drink?  Yes.  Will I ever reach for the bottle again to cope with life and the things that are thrown at me?  I truly  hope not and that is what keeps me working at my sobriety and living a healthy life.  I owe it to my family, my friends, and myself.

I bought a bottle of nice wine to mark the occasion. I told myself it would be a one time thing. A few days later I bought a box of wine. I told myself I'd just have one glass a night to ""help me relax."" The first night I indeed only had one drink. The second night two. The third night three. Last night I had seven. This all happened in a week. I should've known this would spiral. 

When I wasnt drinking I was up early with a smile, reading like two books a week, and generally killing it. Since I tried this ""experiment in moderation"" I've barely touched my books and am so hungover today I dont even want go to the gym though I've been going 6/7 days for a month and a half now.

I'm an alcoholic. Moderate drinking isn't in the cards for me. One turns into seven way too easily. Not to mention I'm sluggish and don't even feel good afterwards.

I'm really committing to the sober life. I'm concerned I won't be able to meet people, but if that's the price then so be it. I'm going to do right be me. I like feeling good more than I like the (empty) promise of meeting someone around the karass of alcohol.

Not to mention literally everyone else in this place was drinking hard.  Who would notice?  

Ive done such a great job being sober for months now, this is our first night out in the new year, I’ve been putting in hard hours at work, I sacrifice myself for my family everyday.  I earned this!  Right?

Wrong!  In a counter move to the drinking-thinking I used some common sense. 

“I don’t need this shot. I don’t even want this shot. I don’t want that life I used to live back.

Yes I have done a great job being sober for months, why change that now?  Keep a good thing going. 

Yes this is our first night out in the new year, I had a great time without alcohol. Why have some at the end?  What will improve by me having this?

Yes I’ve been putting in hard hours at work and since I’ve not been drinking I’ve been more focused and better at my job.  One shot only has the potential to throw me off course. 

Yes I sacrifice for my family everyday but what does that have to do with anything?? I’m contemplating whether or not to have alcohol or not. I would be there for my family no matter what, just in a worse capacity if I was drinking. 

If I’m looking for a reward look no further.  I have my reward.  A family that loves me, a decent paying job, a chance to go out every once in a while.  A clear and sober mind and clear conscience.  Pass up on the shot.”

Only about two seconds passed while all that and more ran through my head. I grabbed the shot and handed it to the girl sitting at the table next to us who was eyeballing it. They all took it and I watched very satisfied with my decision.  

And I’m sitting here this morning writing about being very satisfied with my decision. And tomorrow and next week and the next time I’m faced with a situation like this a year from now, I’ll be very satisfied with my decision.  

Sobriety is like a snowball effect.  Keep that ball rolling.",37

I had a blast, drove my friend home and came home with leftover pizza for my sons.

Finally fulfilling a dream I’ve had for several years. Sorry for a not so typical post but I’m feeling proud and pretty grateful.,"I’m hiking the Pacific Creat Trail this year. It’s a trail in the US that spans over 2k miles from the Mexico border to the Canadian border.

I’ve dreamt of it for years. 

Had I not quit drinking it wouldn’t have been possible to train my body and mind for such a task.
I wouldn’t have been able to save up enough money.
I wouldn’t have had the courage. 
I wouldn’t have been able to do the necessary planning.
I would’ve never started. 

I would 100% fail any attempt I made at it if I were drinking.

This is life. This is living. This is the type of thing that is on offer when you give up the crutch and the escape buttons. 

I don’t know. I’m more writing this as a thank you to my sobriety than anything else. I haven’t given it the credit it deserves in this venture of mine. I’m trying to humble myself to the realization that none of this would have been possible had I not put down the bottle.

The hike will be tough. I’ve got a bad knee, a very tight budget, no plan afterwards (maybe school), extreme sensitivity to cold and I’m terrified of bears.

On the other hand I’ve trained hard. Did lots of sober hiking last summer and dialed in gear.

Last summer on one of my hikes I laid with my head outside of my tent and was in complete awe of the sky. I could see the Milky Way and what the sky looks like outside of the light polluted city. I felt alive. I realized why this is all worth it.

Life, for better or for worst, is unique and it only happens once. This is my one chance to experience myself. To love others. To experience the wholeness that’s there to be had.

Alcohol takes that opportunity away and replaces it with a wall. A time stamp to be revisited one day. My heart goes out to those who never wake back up into the preciousness that their single life has on offer. 

The world is a shitty and beautiful place and I want all of it all. For better and for worse.",1027

To be yourself is a bold act. It’s the most courageous thing you can do.

First it requires the courage to see yourself for who you are and who you can uniquely become. It’s easy to hide from yourself.

Then it requires the courage to endure rejection and judgment from others for being yourself. It’s easy to follow the desire to fit in.

2020-02-22 07:05:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f7rpq6/officially_day_two/,Officially day two.,"So I guess it’s day two for me, it’s 4 am and I can’t sleep. Whatever part of my body I put a blanket over becomes drenched in sweat and whatever part is out becomes freezing cold. My house is trashed, empty random beer cans and liquor bottles, haven’t had the energy to clean but at least I dumped out the full ones. So I’m just on here to vent, or rather to say to someone (or myself) what my life’s been like. 

I got sober first when I was 23. Was sober for 4 years in AA and moved to Seattle and started drinking again. In the last 4 years of drinking I’ve tried to get sober again I think 5 or 6 times, most recently for as long as two months. Im unemployed because I lost my job from drinking, I’ve lost the best relationship I ever had from drinking, last week I was officially 86ed from my 3rd bar in Seattle after something I don’t even remember and ended up doing a little meth that night. Was on a 36 hour bender last week and actually sort of ran into my most recent sponsor, he was across the street of the bar I was at. Not sure if he saw me but I think he did. My depression is at an all time high. I’m so anxious I don’t even want to leave the house to get the mail. 

The most frustrating thing is that no matter how badly alcohol beats me down it’s so easy for me to just say it’s not a big deal and have a drink and figure the rest out later. No matter how many times I’ve been on the floor crying and begging myself to change I just don’t change. I just ignore all those memories and think that if I pretend I’m a normal person I’ll somehow drink like one. So I’ve been trying to repeat the line I used to always hear in AA, that you never have to feel this way again, and I just hope this time it’s true. 

Anyway thanks for letting me share, I will not drink with you today.",28

I've been trying to deepen our relationship over the past few years and it seems like she's open to that, so when we were chatting on the phone last night I decided to be brave and tell her that I had quit drinking. Her immediate reaction was to say "" oh, that's great! That's awesome! I'm so proud of you! Are you going to AA?"" I said yes, and she praised me again.  Now I was of two minds about this, of course I was extremely relieved, to hear her immediate show support and pride in me was awesome. On the other hand, it was proof that maybe my drinking problem was more obvious to other people than I thought.

My wife has been out of town and I've had a lot of intrusive thoughts about drinking, but I've used tools i've learned here, gone to a meeting, and I feel like telling the people that are most important to me about this decision just gives me more reasons to stay sober. I'm accountable to myself, and I'm accountable to my wife, and now I am to my mom as well. It's good stuff and such a relief.

I was pretty darn close to it though.  I work as a teacher and started the day with a 12 year old telling me to ""Shut the fuck up!""  Things just kept going sideways from there.  There must have been something in the air because kids were just off yesterday.  I was able to leave early because my daughter was home sick.  My wife was staying out for a happy hour with her work friends and I had been invited.  She still doesn't get that idea that I can NEVER drink again if she wants to keep the mean, abusive, drunk driving, unhealthy version of me away.  I went home bored on a Friday and watched a movie.  I couldn't get in touch with my wife which just pissed me off more.

Then there was a moment of clarity around 8 o'clock.  My wife was on her way home, she hadn't drank nearly as much as I projected she would.  I stopped and thought, ""I have had a shit day.  Does this really need to translate to me waking up hungover and then hearing from my family about some horrible things I said and did while drunk?  When I drink, I drink to blackout.  When I drink and I'm angry, I take out my anger on those around me while blacked out.  Will this scenario really make my weekend get better?  Will it fix any of the things from the day?  No! It will only worsen them.  I woke up sober this morning.  I have God and the support of people like you guys to thank.",107

My friends are totally cool with it. I was not tempted to drink at all and drank Coca-Cola and 2 NA beers. At one point, I get to talking to a fairly inebriated and friendly guy after ordering a coke. He says he's more a beer drinker but he gets how people like bacardi coke. So after chuckling to myself I tell him I don't drink alcohol and he seems surprised. We splinter off into talking about drugs and addiction and I kid you not, at one point he says 'I don't do drugs either' and takes a big sip of beer. Come again?! It really is crazy to me sometimes how the global alcohol marketing machine can actually brainwash so many people into not realizing that they are consuming a DRUG that can make them an addict. I told him alcohol is actually a drug and he looked at me very perplexed, and that was the end of that conversation... And I guess the cycle continues. Just a rant. Enjoy your weekend.",7

I didn't drink, which I'm glad of. In the depth of my apathy I entertained the idea of one of my classic binges, but it passed. It just sucked to go from excited that I'm changing my life for the better to wondering what's the point of trying so hard.

A weekend in Vancouver followed by 4 glorious bluebird sky days of skiing at Whistler/Blackcomb. Simply amazing! 

The caveat being...family trips are a huge trigger for me...as are airports.

My boyfriend knows the extent of my problem with alcohol and that I am doing my best to stay free and clear. He also knows that my family is not the greatest influence...Despite traveling alone (the bf had to take a later flight and the fam came from a different state) the almost two months of sobriety helped me avoid my usual pre flight temptations and stick to a Diet Dr Pepper. The trouble began, however, when I met up with my family at the hotel. It turns out a new trigger came along with them, the news that my grandfather (92 on Monday and one heck of a guy) is back in the hospital and this time in the ICU. This is not entirely unexpected but sad none the less as well as unfortunate timing. To cope, my mother declared that she was going to drink -heavily- because as she put it, her father was dying.

With that, my father and I checked into the rooms and brought up the luggage while my mom found a comfy spot in the bar with my brother to drink a bottomless double glass of wine. Though my brother opted for harder, mixed drinks, after the rooms were sorted, my dad joined the wine party.

Here is where my Canadian Hero enters our story. My boyfriend had not yet arrived (a sturdy arm to lean on in times of weakness), the rest of my family is drinking and I have an ""excuse"" to join in... I devour the pages of drinks for something, anything, to have that would do in this situation... then my eyes land on the perfect thing, a ""Winter Mule"" cranberry, cinnamon and ginger ale in a tall glass with a lime on the rim.  $16 for the thing (albeit Canadian) is kind of a dick move, hotel... ಠ_ಠ but it was what I needed. That, alternated with water, kept me through the post flight drink off and when the group moved to a restaurant (to get some food in mom's stomach before she lost the ability to walk over) a brand new selection greeted my searching eyes, anxiously scanning their menu and my sobriety reigned.

I know Canada isn't the only place to offer virgin cocktails and that any bartender worth their salt could whip up something % free and fancy (of course a soda isn't the worst option comparatively) but there are times when that feels too hard to ask for and I appreciated this little Canadian moment, eh?",18

I know one thing at least it's that I won't drink today and I will wake up sober on Sunday morning. I'm looking forward to that.

Got up to 20 beer per day.  My rule was if my eyes were open and I could, I would drink (beer only).  I work from home on my computer most days sitting right next to my bar fridge.  No one really knew how much I drank because I was one of those functional types, and hid the beer. Not an easy job with those many cans. Good career.  No DUIs/drink driving.  No puking.  No hangovers.  2 happy Daughters 26 and 16 yrs old.  

She must have dreaded holidays.  Especially cruises (where I would sneak-drink triple what she thought I was) and beach holidays.  I even drove drunk many times in foreign countries, I hate to say.  What would have happened if I got caught or hit anyone makes me shudder.

Her Dad died Dec 28th 2019. Before we knew she asked me to drive up to check on him cause no phone answer.  30 min drive.  She found a half drank beer next to my chair that morning and let me have it (before she suspected her Dad was in trouble) because she thought I had quit for 1 year.

When I got there the police were already there because someone found him dead from natural causes and called them.  While waiting around, after talking to the Police, I actually went back to my car and chugged the final beer.  I went back and talked to the police like I was the smartest guy in the room.  One of them pulls me aside and asks 'have you been drinking because me and my partner can smell it on you and your acting that way'.  I deny it and say it's my anti anxiety meds.  I know he doesn't buy and and the world stands still for what seems like an hour.  His next words could end my life as I know it.  IE breathalyzer, blow over, handcuffs, back of police car. (he saw me pull up driving earlier)  Instead he says 'considering the circumstances, I will just ask you that you do not drive home.  Can someone else drive'  I say yes, my Wife and kids are on the way.  I thank him.  Walk away and almost faint realizing what could have just happened.  I walk to the public bathroom and puke my guts out (which I hadn't done in 20 years from drinking).

My Wife and kids pull up and now I have to go into damage control mode.  She is already inconsolable because her Dad just died (89).  I see them going to the same Cop and run over because I have to control the conversation and somehow have to get him to NOT mention the suspicion of drinking.  I blurt out to everyone that the Police have asked me not to drive because I took too much medication (I said I took 2 instead of the usual 1).  I in fact, had not taken any.  My oldest Daughter yelled at me 'how could you!' But in the end she drove the car home.  The cop didn't say a word about suspecting me of drinking.

Then the horrible job of dealing with the Coroner and eventually wheeling her Dad out had to happen.  A long day made longer when my buzz wore off.  A long drive home too in silence.  I found 2 more beers at home and chugged them back in 1 minute.  Didn't help.  That was my last beer since Dec 28th 2019.  Little did they know the earth shattering bullet we all just dodged because of my sickness.  Reading back the word sickness seems like a cop-out.  An excuse.  More like 'beacause I was an ASSHOLE'.  It would have affected generations because I know my Wife would have left me and taken the kids.  Relationships ruined for years to come.

I thank God for that day, because when my beer brain starts whispering 'you can sneak some again.  You did it for months without anyone knowing.  You're one of those high functioning types.'  Also my friend knows but says, 'let's go on a cruse and get shit faced.  She'll never know.'  Then i think back to that earth stopping moment the Cop did NOT ask me to blow and my normal brain says. THAT'S NOT NORMAL OR REASONABLE BEHAVIOUR.  You have a problem.  

Wow.  I meant just to type in the title ""How do I say sorry to my Wife for drinking for the last 20 yrs while she put up with me?"" and leave the subject blank.  I guess I needed to get some things out in the open so I could see the words myself.  I did some horrible things I know (and i will never tell her about them), but please don't hate-on me for them.  I am trying to change for the better.

Do I have to start at day 0 again now? I’ve been so proud of myself and feeling so much better and I managed to stop myself... but I still had half a drink... I didn’t feel anything but idk do I need to start over now? I just feel so ashamed of myself that starting over feels impossible and if I could just keep going to day 12 feels more possible.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

    Europe - Morning  
    Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

Morning SD on this Super Saturday! I hope everyone had a sober 24! If you picked up, start anew today!

There are no words to adequately express how thankful I am to have found Stop Drinking on my day one! There is a lot to be said about the strength of numbers. It is very powerful when a group gathers and puts positive energy out into the universe! We are 220,000 strong and create a collective consciousness together! Amazing things happen here as we rise by lifting up one another! Our common goal bonds us! We don’t just sympathize, we understand. We don’t judge, we’ve been there! We understand the struggles, pain and milestones! We don’t just listen we hear!  We are not alone, we have each other! Together we make a difference!

My week is over and I am a better person for what I have gained through this experience! If you have 30 or more days sober and want to host the DCI in the weeks to come, let me know. You will be giving back to our wonderful community and reaping a blessing in the process!",86

A big revelation that I had was when I was reading “Quit like a woman” (I know Holly Whitaker isn’t for everyone but her book helped me a ton) and it said something like “You don’t have to be an alcoholic to want to reevaluate your relationship with alcohol, or remove it from your life”. I always thought if I quit, it meant I was an alcoholic failure who was doomed and unredeemable. It’s nice to know I can just make a decision that fits my life and promotes my health, without having to “decide” what I am and constantly go back and forth about it.

2020-02-21 22:24:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f7msii/just_got_my_second_dui/,Just got my second DUI,"Last Sunday I woke up in jail with my second DUI. I have been struggling with alcohol addiction for a while but have managed to stay out of trouble for the last 8 years. There were many times durring the past where my relationships (girlfriends and family)  have been negatively affected by my drinking. I would just tell myself that I made a mistake and that I would work on cutting back but it never lasted long.  My first DUI was when I was 19 (I'm 27 now) and it put my family through hell. I totaled my car and racked up a few other misdemeanor charges. I stopped drinking for 8 months but eventually started up again. Through the years I progressivly started drinking more and more and eventually got to the point where I would start ocasionally drinking  in the morning after a night out. Fast forward a few more years and waking up after a night out I would start nursing the hangover as soon as I got up. I was not drinking every day maybe 4 days out of the week and would only have a bender on the weekends. I would always have this voice in my head telling me I need to stop but I would just tell myself that it's ok and I got this under control. There were times where I would stop for a week but I always kept coming back to the bottle. I enjoyed the escape and not having to worry about any problems that I might be having with at the time. Whenever I drank nothing good ever came out of it. The amount of stuff I have lost (phones, watches, hats etc.) I would write off as oh well it was a fun night. Blacking out was a very common occurence for me and I got used to it that it never seemed wrong. Sunday morning when I woke up in jail it was the first time I woke up and said to myself, ""I'm done with this shit. All alcohol has done for me has caused problems it's not worth it anymore."" It took me years to finally admit to myself that I have a drinking problem. I was always too afraid to admit it to myself. I need to give up drinking for good. I finally feel like I have the power to do this. I know I will be facing some jail time and  burning through my savings because of this. However I am happy. Money is important but what is more important than money is my health and relationships with my family and friends. I am finally ready to make the step into sobriety and I know I can do it. I will be starting outpatient treatment soon as well as attending AA meetings. Alcohol had taken over my life and now I am finally ready to take back what it took from me. Much love to everyone out there and I know I have a difficult journey ahead. I just can't take it anymore and it's time to start a new chapter in my life. As soon as I starting drinking the alcohol would take over and I could just not stop. If you are reading this and are thinking about wanting to stop drinking. Look back and see what alcohol has done for you and that should answer your question for you. Finally admitting to myself I need help was one of the hardest things I have done. But it can be done. Goodbye alcohol and hello to a new life.

Edit: I would just like to add that I feel very fortunate that I have not hurt anyone through my reckless behaviour by drinking and driving. This gives me hope to know that I still have a chance to turn my life around and get back to the place I want to be. Drinking and driving is no joke and I am very ashamed of my behavior. Wishing everyone the best in their recovery and thanks for all the positive support. I love all of you and together we can beat this terrible addiction.",288

In below zero temps on my way home from a Christmas party. I've made excuses saying it was other things involved, bad food, whatever. It wasn't. I drank too much and I blacked out in the streets by a highway.

I used to say I'll only do one or two just cause my back hurt, or cause it had been a long day, and would go out of my way for it, spending the money I shouldn't. Being in groups of people didn't help.  I'd always have to outdo others and prove I could drink a lot. But what did that do?

Sitting where I am now, no excuses, about two months since that night without a drink. It's been tough in social groups, but I am ok with it cause I can be in control of me. I need to be in control of me, otherwise what's the point right? Anyways. I'm two months in and proud of being this far in. Thanks for reading.

I’m staying few extra nights to visit an old friend. I told him I’m not drinking, but today while touring around I was really noticing how there are SO many bars and liquor stores, and it smells like weed everywhere. 

I’ve caught a little part of my brain saying, “you could get drunk tonight. No one would know.” Or “you could just restart your sobriety date - what’s the big deal? Just buy some weed - that will make it better.”

I immediately started crying. Next month will be two years. The bartender looked horrified. She almost cried as my friend explained I'm sober.

Then I might decide to reduce how much I drink. My liquor bottles are running out faster than I'm comfortable with or whatever.

When I say to someone I'm going to drink less they will always make excuses for me. They'll basically be like, you're cool, you're not waking up and drinking to stop the shakes, you're not yelling at people or getting into fights.

Like??? Why do I have to wait for that to happen to want to be better to myself? I feel like it's because they might drink more than I do and they're confronted.

It's like everyone wants you to be alcoholic. They encourage it and act like it's funny and endearing until you are in a really dire situation and then it's you who has a problem.

I say this because I was looking for resources for my boyfriend. I think his drinking is becoming a problem and affecting his life. But a lot of questionaires are really intense. People who are starting down a dangerous path might not relate to all of the questions and could have a false sense of security about their lifestyle.

I saw a comment once with a list of statements and you see how many you relate to. They were more about your relationship with alcohol, the reasons you drink, thinking the drunk version of yourself is better. I can't find it! I really want to find it or something like it!",12

I just moved in there are not many meetings around me so I’m very limited, most of them require me to drive which I am terrified to do, especially in this area. I just moved to California and the roads are crazy. I just tried to find one of the meetings within walking distance and could not for the life of me find this place so defeated I went home. I can’t keep doing this. Because I waited a few days, I  decided to drink last night, one of those four packs of the mini bottles of wine telling myself I could only have 2. I finished three and force myself to spit out the contents of the fourth. Still mildly hung over. Tired of doing this. I’ll be so motivated and then I’ll fall right back off once I’m feeling better, as if I just forget all about what the hangover feels like. I absolutely cannot do this on my own, I’m feeling a little frantic that there aren’t any meetings nearby.

I don't know if the right word is shocked or amazed at some of the stories we get on this sub of your struggles and your achievements.  Everybody has their own story, their own beginning and eventual ends. I like to think learning about different people's struggles and triggers can help others in a way as to let us know we really aren't the only ones.  

My question is how old were you when you started drinking?  Was there a reason?  What made you start the change to quit?

Me?  I never drank anything aside from stealing a sip of beer when my dad would ask me to go and get him one. My dad was an alcoholic, but he'd seriously toned it down by the time I was 8 so I don't really remember it. Mom lets me know of stories when we talk, but I can't think of much. So aside from those sips that was it. Legal age in my province is 19.  I had my first 6 pack a week before my 19th birthday at a golf tournament. Mom gave me shit, dad didn't care.  

After that it wasn't much. Not a lot, weekends only was always a rule. I stuck with that for the most part.    I guess the shit hit the fan for me was after taking time off work for depression I was a month or two away from going back to work.  One Sunday I woke up, found it strange my kids weren't there to give me a kiss to wake me up. Went to the bathroom, saw a note on the microwave. She up and left. No notice, no communication, just a Dear John letter.  The signs were there up to it, but I think I was naive and purposely ignored it. But man oh man, has anybody had to listen to their 5/7 year old kids cry on the phone that they want to come home but they know they can't?  Fuck it sucked.  I did what a dad is supposed to do. Keep it in check. Play the tough guy part. But it broke me. I kept it together for pretty close to 1/2 a year. Then the wheels fell off.  Weekends turned to once a week, 3 days...7 days.  This was 2012.  

So much for the keeping it to myself. I drank everyday. When it was my time with the kids. It turned into day time fun, night time movies while dad drank.  Never once did I drive with them or put them in danger besides being drunk.  But I justified it so easily.  My poor kids now 15/17 had to see me do this to myself and to them

It's mid November 2019. I was tired. Physically and mentally. I legit couldn't walk 100 feet without feeling like I was going to faint. I did our usual "" I'll start Monday"" lie that we like to tell ourselves. But I actually started.  So I got up Monday, left my wallet at home as to not grab beer on the way home.   I found this sub and you guys and decided to tone it down.  It's not a perfect system but I've gone from being deunk daily to having Saturdays (every other when the kids aren't here) hockey night.  I will aim to strike it completely.  

So here I am now.  Using you guys on here as inspirations. Getting jealous of the ones who have completely kicked for x amount of days, weeks and years. Hoping that I can give a bit of advice to somebody who hits that little bump and let them know they aren't alone.


Keep up the good work.

Well. I almost made it to a year. I was so close!

But if it hadn’t happened then, I’m pretty confident it would have just happened later. When I picked up my first white chip almost a year ago, things were still pretty good. I lived with my pastor dad who has always been extraordinarily fearful of alcohol, and to be an active drinker at home meant I had to do it without him noticing. That meant my metric for failing, for having a problem, was much, much higher than it would have been if I were on my own. So when I got to the point that my family noticed, when they immediately ushered me into a rehab program, I still had a lot of things going for me. Sure, I was failing out of college. Again. And sure, my sparkly internship was in jeopardy, and I had to tell my boss, for the second time in two semesters, that I couldn’t start as a full timer the date we agreed on, that I’d signed on, because I wouldn’t be graduating. But I hadn’t lost my job (yet). Nor had I lost my relationships, or my family, or my financial well-being. 

I met a lot of people whose stories seemed so much worse than mine. So I felt pretty sick to my stomach when I heard testimonies that reminded me so much of myself. Alcoholism isn’t something people talk much about out in the wild, so this was the first time I’d heard much about it (the truth of it anyways, not just warnings from my parents), and hearing things I related with on such a level was pretty scary. I hadn’t gone to rehab for an alcohol problem. I went to rehab because I was anxious and depressed, because I (a 4.0 student many, many moons ago) couldn’t pass college, because it was the prettiest way to fail and the easiest way to tell my boss I wasn’t graduating again. I figured, if I had to fall out of the plane one way or another, I may as well do it with a parachute. 

Discovering I have alcoholism felt like something I did accidentally along the way. It felt like I saw the train headlights coming in the distance, and by some grace I put two and two together and realized, hey, if nobody else feels this way, but you feel this way, and I feel this way, then maybe I’m like you. So it almost felt like I caught it early. I never knew the truly harsh consequences of alcoholism. I isolated, but I was never alone. I was never arrested, never woke up in a hospital. I was fortunate to keep most everything I started with. 

But what I’ve learned about the gift of desperation is that it is truly a gift. The allure of being a one-chip-wonder was pretty nice, but I only met one other in my last year, and his own trials and tribulations FAR outpaced mine, he went through hell to land where he did. And it’s slowly become apparent why those people are so rare. Throughout every step of my journey I wondered, is this really me? Am I sure I’m really like these people? I related to everything they said, but I’d never tried to stop on my own, I couldn’t convince myself it would really be the way they said it would if I tried.

Three weeks ago I was feeling the most confident in my program I’d ever been. I was going to 3-4 meetings a week and FINALLY going because I realized how much better I feel when I go, and not just because people told me to. But those doubts never really went away. I can only guess I was overconfident, because when an opportunity came up, for whatever reason this time, I took it. I’ll say, I didn’t initially relapse with alcohol. I relapsed with my old DOC, over some of it I found in my old room, but it didn’t matter. One thing led to the next, like a comically long and slow slip (have you seen that video of the guy slipping on ice for like 30 straight seconds? Yeah.) and before I knew it, I was stopping by the liquor store on the way home again. 

Thankfully I was able to catch myself after only about a week and a half, and I still didn’t face any actual serious consequences, but it was different this time. 




SO. What did I learn??

I’ve always been told, “just because you aren’t drinking doesn’t mean your disease has slowed down. In fact your disease is outside the door right now, doing push-ups and getting stronger every day, just waiting for a chance to catch you slipping.” Yeah, yeah. That’s very poetic, it sounds great in a meeting. ...right? Oh boy. 

Yeah, turns out they WEREN’T kidding. When I went back out this time it was so much different. Even though I still didn’t have any truly serious consequences, I had my ASS handed to me six ways from Sunday. I put so many little tests in place for myself and I failed every single one. The score was something like addiction monster 47, me 0. It wasn’t even close. 

It started with just at night when all my obligations were taken care of. Before I knew it, before even a week had past, I was cutting work early to go home and drink alone. And once I’d initially relapsed, there wasn’t a single break day in between, it was every day from relapse day to the end. It was never like that for me before, I got drunk 3 or 4 days a week at most. And I tried, I actually set out to have break days and it just didn’t happen, I discovered myself at home drunk every night. I even found myself cracking my double shot in the car on the way home, something I’ve NEVER done. And I was unhappy, I didn’t have a good time at all. It was like they all say, I quit drinking 7 times in a week, but come the next day I was overruled. I let my alcoholism in the driver’s seat for one moment and they didn’t give me back the control for even a second. 

While I was drunk and miserable one night, an analogy came to my head. I’ve always thought of drinking alcohol like thumb wrestling (yes this is a weird thought, but I’m going somewhere with it I promise). For some reason, I’ve always really liked thumb wrestling. There’s just something about it, it’s fun, it’s competitive, I get to whoop up on this little thumb, and I just enjoy it in a way that doesn’t make sense to most people. But I do, and that was okay for a while. But somewhere along the line, that little thumb started to grow. It got to be ankle high, then knee high, then waist high. And before I knew it, I couldn’t wrestle with it without leaving with some cuts and bruises. And even then, it kept growing, bigger and bigger until it was this big hulking thing, like a massive body builder, and it had this ugly scar over its eye and tattoos everywhere and it’s grown a second set of arms. And now when I tussled with it, it wasn’t even close, it kicked my ass and I didn’t stand a prayer. 

Through the last year of sobriety, and in particular about three weeks ago, I found myself thinking, “man, I miss thumb wrestling. It was always so fun. And I’m such a good thumb wrestler. I’d absolutely ANNIHILATE some little thumb. Plus after all that time I spent fighting way worse, man, I’d show up with like, guuuuns and kniiiiiives and I’ll kick that thing’s ass, no mercy, it wouldn’t even be close.”

And so three weeks ago, I showed up expecting a thumb wrestling match. After all this time, I expected my opponent would have shrunk back down to size. But that’s just not what happened. He showed up bigger and stronger than ever and he absolutely kicked the shit out of me. No contest. I still like thumb wrestling, but the cold reality is that that’s just not the game I’m playing anymore. Things changed and they aren’t going to change back. When I hit ready player 1, I’m not put into a thumb wrestling match, I’m put into the ring against Mike Tyson. I might have an ego but I’m not ever going to be a good enough fighter to come out against something like that. The cold hard truth is, other people may be able to thumb wrestle, but I’ll never have another thumb wrestle again. It sucks, I hate it, but it’s the way things are and getting okay with that now means more time being okay later. 

I’m hesitant to say I’m thankful for my relapse. Because it sucked, I hated it, and I didn’t have any fun at all. Not to mention my day count is starting over. But I look back on where I was before and I think, man, that guy’s situation was a lot more delicate than he realized, I’m not sure how long it could have lasted. And so here I am, with my second white chip and halfway to my second 30 day chip, knowing this time, without a shadow of a doubt, yes I have this thing, and yes it’s worse than you think it is. And I can’t help but think I’m better off without the uncertainty I held in secret before. I hope that maybe my story will resonate with and help motivate someone else. IWNDWYT.",25

About a year ago I posted here after a rather rough dui experience, lost my license for a year, paying thousands in fines, fees, and for a lawyer, and greatly dissatisfied with state of addiction. I expected nothing but shame and humiliation from this subreddit, no doubt only due to my own self hatred.

But a year has passed and I'm glad to admit I'm still sober, not one drop of alcohol has been imbibed by me since that fateful day. My attitude has turned around as well, no longer do I see myself as a failed person but more so someone learning upon his path. I used to be worried that sober me wasn't nearly fun enough to be around, now I know regardless of mental state I can be the life of the party should I choose to be.

I've been tempted quite a bit, as I still go to functions and meetups with friends at bars but for the last year I've left every one of those hydrated, happy, and clear minded. No matter how good it sounds at the time, the words of my daughter when she saw the wreckage of my truck echo in my head, ""Daddy, were you drinking?"" I am an alcoholic, and I will never forget that no matter how long my sobriety lasts.

Thank you to everyone in here who comments well wishes, positivity, and positive reinforcement. To those who comment on the perceived ""failing"" posts with not judgement, but love. You are all fantastic people and it warms my heart to know I inhabit a world with people like you.

I'm a dude in my early twenties from Denmark. In Denmark a large part of youth culture here is (and some danes would vehemently disagree with me) excessive binge drinking.

3 years ago, for the first time I started noticing drinking stopped doing anything for me. I no longer felt the mild euphoria of a couple of drinks in, that I usually did. I no longer felt like I was having fun. My nights also often consisted of doing shit you'd regret the day after, which rendered my already increasingly long hangovers even more miserable due to regret and self hate. My health was also deteriorating. Libido was much lower, my sleep terrible, and my skin looked awful. Despite this I kept drinking weekly with my friends whom all supported each other in the drinking. 

Two weeks ago I decided no more. Something I've decided every week for three years. Finally, I lasted more than a week. I have more energy, I feel happier, less anxious and I don't even feel like drinking. I just needed to get it out. I'm proud, and I hope it lasts. Have a good day/evening folks.",256

He destroyed every possession of mine with a chainsaw when I was 8 or 9. 20 years later, I found it within myself, somehow, to reach out to him. He made ammends, we talked off and on for about a year, and then he decided to threaten to kill someone and disfigure their family. He got arrested and I got a call that he hung himself in jail. I spent all of last year putting my life on hold virtually overnight to settle his estate, before the final sale of his home in September, when I thought I could finally move on.

I promise you that I’m not trolling. It’s embarrassing to write this knowing that it’s probably going to get downvoted. But please hear me out.

I have been wanting to get sober for awhile now, and I finally decided to go to an AA meeting yesterday. I should point out that I find smoking to be gross and I am very sensitive to the smell. Being around too much of the smell is a major trigger of mine.

I didn’t know that everyone meets up beforehand to smoke outside. I wanted to chit chat with people, but I couldn’t stand the smoke. So I hid inside the church for a bit until the meeting was about to start. However, there was still a strong scent of cigarette breath inside the meeting. I couldn’t take it anymore. Before I even got to speak, I bolted out and went home where I drank a bottle of wine.

I bought an energy drink that has 300mg of caffeine. I love energy drinks - I tend to have one daily. It's one of my remaining vices. Anyway, I got this new brand that supposedly had some green tea stuff and amino acids. I took one sip and gagged. It tasted just like warm brandy. 

I can't believe I had convinced myself that I liked the taste. It was a strange sensation, and my whole body just shook from the taste of it. I poured the rest out and gagged a few more times.

I am thankful to be sober. Those little reminders (the taste) are shocking sometimes.

2020-02-21 17:21:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f7ita4/if_this_reaches_any_new_comers_please_click_here/,"If this reaches any new comers, please click here. Today is day 93 for me. 3 Months. Here are some of the things I've learned and some of the things that have improved in my life. It's a bit of a long read, so I'm sorry, but I hope this can help somebody.","I really have no idea where to start. Well, I feel a lot better generally. Dark days are still there, yes, but there are also a lot more beautiful days- and the beautiful days are beautiful because I can let them be beautiful. Does that make sense?

Happiness is not something that can be acquired, even better, it's something that can be created. Going this long without drinking, I've been able to focus more on the positive things I have in life rather than solely on the *what could have been*'s and the *what once were*'s. And for the longest time, I believed that all of the positive things I had were actually curses. I was resentful, and sometimes I still catch myself in those thinking patterns. But that's the thing, I can *catch* myself and stop the thoughts and replace them with positives. I couldn't do that when I was drinking, and I thought that it was just the way my brain was wired because I grew up with depression.

There are a lot of unfortunate facts that I have to face now that alcohol ""shielded"" me from: faults of my own which I once blamed on others, inevitable endings which I couldn't have prevented and the guilt of not enjoying the moments before them, the misery that my own suffering inflected on those who cared and care about me, and so forth. But the joy of facing those facts lays in the ability to learn from the suffering and prevent the same mistakes from happening again. Life *is* hard, but by drinking to ease the pain I only made it harder. 

My relationships have grown stronger, both the important ones and the ones that may have seemed not so important. I had/have a lot of social anxiety and I often have let it cripple me in life, but that doesn't mean that now all of a sudden I'm a sex god who goes on stage every weekend to perform in front of crowds of hot strangers who drool at the thought of sleeping with me. No I'm still a wimp for the most part. I'm afraid of trying to skateboard and fall in front of girls and be laughed at, and I'm afraid of going to see the local bands because ""oh i know some of them as old friends to whom i've embarrassed myself irreversibly in the past."" 

But one anxiety that HAS improved is my fear of talking to people and looking them in the eye. In focusing so much on my major fears, i often failed to notice all the times I could have simply said ""good morning"" to a fellow coworker who may have had a shitty night arguing with his ex wife or for whatever reason. It matters. Now that I'm not drinking, I can make people smile, and that makes me smile. I can listen to what the outcast of a group has to say, and I can empathize with them and make them feel cared for, because I was an outcast too and I don't have to treat others the way I was once treated.

I've also lost some weight! I cut back on eating like a pig, and I've started exercising too, as well as taking medication that aids with focus and determination to meet goals (for ADHD). Have gained a bit more confidence. Started making amends with some of the people I've wronged in the past. 

But most surprisingly of all, I've slowly started to allow God in my life. This is surprising to me because 'the whole god shit"" is what I hated about AA, and i grew up hating church saying ""jesus is a cunt"" and my first ever tattoo was the Hebrew word for ""Satan."" I was a self proclaimed Satanist, forreal. I'm not an altar boy yet by any means, but I *am* ready to stop being a fucking asshole to myself and others. I can see how it is helpful to many having faith in a spiritual presence, fighting life by myself is pointless and ""Satan"" sure wasn't helping, he was supposedly banished to Hell, so says the story. Do I really want to worship the ""loser"" archetype? I become what I worship. I saw myself in Satan as the outcast freedom fighter, but there is no way Hell can be perceived as BLISSFUL, not unless you make heaven of hell and hell of heaven. So therefore, if I worship something that is generally, and at its core, perceived to be and representative of literal GOODNESS, then hopefully I will become good myself. 

And what better way to achieve BLISS, or nirvana, or Happiness, than through being good?

Does that make sense?

Peace and love to you all, have an absolutely great sober weekend. I Will Not Drink With You Today",52

I'm talking start with 1 beer, get another beer, feelin good. why not lets get a shot. I'm feelin frisky, how about a gin and tonic.

Okay I'm done, time to go home. see a bar on the way home, ay shit i'll stop in to see my fave bartender. Another G&T, enter a conversation. 

8 drinks later and half a pack of cigarettes I'm home and making a mess. I get injuries I don't remember, I lose shit. I give my jewelry away to strangers and i wake up not being able to face myself or anything I've done. And the only way I feel like I can face myself is to have another drink.

This happens 4-5 times a week at least. and when I'm too ashamed to go out to drink, I'll go to the store and drink at home alone.

Yesterday I said no more. Instead of drinking, I went on a nice 4 mile walk. I wanted to buy some weed so I could cope, but I realize its just another crutch that can backfire on me while I'm fragile. 

Today, I \*WILL\* go to my first AA meeting. I will not drink today. I'm working on quitting cigarettes, but thats a whole different can of worms.

She wants to talk and joke around. I’m dead in the middle of sleep and was not amused.

I leave early for work and she’s calling me but I don’t answer. I go home for lunch to assess the damage and she’s there eating a Big Mac, obviously skipping work for the day. She apologizes for the damage, but hates that I’m so moody at 1:00 am. She resents me trying to go sober and that I’ve tried to tell her that she’s got a problem with alcohol. Truth is of course I’d like her not to drink, but I don’t care if she does (I even buy her wine) - I do care about her behavior.

When I make a goal that seems insurmountable, like quitting drinking, it's really hard for me to focus on a specifically large number. It's daunting to see people with 1000s of days of sobriety on here. I look at my number 10 and think, that's a world away. 

I was on a run today and wasn't feeling it, 1 mile in I wanted to quit, then I thought, just 8 minutes at a time. ""You can do anything for 8 minutes?"" I ended up running 3.22 miles breaking it all down off an 8-minute mile pace. 

That's how I am looking at drinking, for me right now ""you can do anything for 1 day"" works, but I don't know if that always will. I have a dinner coming up with my college, buddies, not sure the last time we did anything sober. For that dinner, I am breaking it down to ""you can do anything for 3 hours"". 

Find your unit of measurement, and knock it out. Each time you do, you accomplish something, and it's important to celebrate wins along the way to remain motivated.

My life has changed in the last 6 months, I am fitter, happier. My relationship with my girlfriend is the best it’s ever been and I am doing so well at work. I am proud. 
I would have to write an essay to describe the destruction that alcohol has caused in my life. I have had months off work, been drunk-driving, destroyed a previous relationship and caused untold misery to my family.
Circumstances have conspired to mean that both my girlfriend and I will be in different countries working over the next few days. The temptation to ‘just have one’ is strong.
The last time I drank I was in the street battered and bruised at the end of a week-long uncontrolled binge. If I pick up a drink now, deep down I know, nothing has changed. I will be miserable, I will inevitably lose control.
I have ‘lurked’ here for a few years now, I have tried AA but stopped going, I don’t know why, maybe I should restart.
I have only got here today by taking it one day at a time, I grasped that much at least from AA.
I posted today because of temptation but for anyone new here, keep coming back, keep reading, we are special people, I think we are great. This community gives me the strength to keep going. I’m posting now to solidify the strength and keep going. 
Sobriety has been the best thing by far and away that has ever happened to me, it will be for you too.

-My face is less puffy.


-My nails are stronger.


-I am more active.


-My resting heart rate has gone down about 5 points.


-My anxiety levels have decreased dramatically. I still am dealing with depression but my anxiety has become a lot more tolerable. I don’t have to be anxious over what drunk me did, I am sober and myself and every decision I make is my own 100%. I still make mistakes but instead of drowning them I can notice and work on them.


-I have followed through with a lot more things. I had a lot of ideas that would stay ideas when I drank. Now I’m taking the next step and actually trying or doing things.


-My sleep is not awesome yet. I’ve been tossing and turning a lot more. I’m having some very violent and real feeling dreams on some nights.


-Every week or so I wake up in a foul mood and hate everything during the day. I have a lot of rage and anger I’ve never really dealt with before and I am finding it difficult. I might exercise or try to push myself out of this anger but it doesn’t always work. Having emotions and bad days are a part of being human and I’m learning to accept this.


-I still have other vices (Reddit and food) that I realize I will need to work on. I might not be there yet but I’ll get there a lot quicker then I would have if I were not drinking.


-My self respect is growing. I hated myself before. I would ruminate over all the negative things and stay there. I’m working on loving myself. 



-My attitude towards moderation has changed. I’m understanding that it is not an option for me. My life is a lot better without alcohol. Drinking will not open any doors for me. 


-Not drinking makes your bill at a restaurant a lot cheaper. I’ve saved a bit of money over the last 50 days.


-Reading posts here and reading books about sobriety has helped a lot. I do love reading others lists so I thought I’d share my own.

I was no longer super-duper passionate about my job, so that is one okay-ish thing...perhaps this will turn out okay and I will discover something I am more passionate about.

I cared about my job though, and I had worked with the same people for over five years and I will miss them. My boss was a huge support for me as well as some of my coworkers.

Getting fired is like losing a family.

Plus, I'm in the US, so employment is tied to insurance...I will lose my therapy, group therapy, so much support I need right now just gone.

Zero desire to drink, so that's good. I filed for unemployment and will look into getting gov. insurance to get me thru until I find another job.

I have to believe I will get through this but today it feels like the end of the world.

# Know the facts about alcohol and climate change

By Miranda Green

If you did dry January this year, you probably reduced your carbon footprint without knowing it. That’s because alcohol production and distribution can be quite energy intensive. So, what if you want to reduce your environmental footprint but you’re not quite ready to hop on the wagon and stay there?

Whatever your poison, one of the most important things you can do, for your health and for the planet, is drink in moderation. Even if you don’t cut out the booze, keep it reasonable. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means [one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/alcohol-use.htm).

Beyond that, it helps to know the facts about your drink of choice.

Broadly speaking, liquor tends to be more environmentally sustainable per unit. “The more concentrated they are, the less impact they have,” Alissa Kendall, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Davis, said of alcoholic beverages.

Drinkers typically get more mileage out of a bottle of spirits than wine or beer. That’s especially true if you drink to get a buzz. Simply put: Liquor is quicker.

For beer, the world’s most consumed alcoholic beverage, refrigeration is a big part of the emissions equation. A [2008 study by the New Belgium Brewing Company](https://www.ess.uci.edu/~sjdavis/pubs/Fat_Tire_2008.pdf), based in Fort Collins, Colo., found that the greenhouse gas emissions from one six-pack were about the same as driving a car nearly eight miles. The largest share of those emissions came from refrigeration. Craft beers must remain chilled to retain their flavor profile, experts say.

Another factor to consider is packaging materials. Is the beer in a glass bottle or a can? In the United States, the most environmentally friendly option is almost always the can. Not only is aluminum lighter to ship, but it’s more likely to be recycled.

According to Georgie Walker, co-author of [a sustainability study for the Firestone Walker Brewing Company](https://www.firestonebeer.com/files/FW_Sustainability-11x17-web.pdf), her family’s business, it’s also important to look at the number of miles a beer has covered after being bottled. Then, buy local.

“It will be fresher,” Ms. Walker said. “It won’t be sitting in storage as long and won’t have the gas miles behind it.”

Shipping distance can also be an important consideration when choosing climate-friendly wine. A [study by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality](https://www.oregon.gov/deq/FilterDocs/PEF-Wine-FullReport.pdf), for example, found that transportation accounted for 13 percent of wine’s emissions in the state.

Generally, shipping by sea is better than train, and train is better than truck.

An easy way to assess the emissions in play is to consider the East Coast, West Coast divide. Wines from Chile, for instance, are often transported in giant vats via ship to the West Coast, where they are bottled and then moved to market. Those wines could be a sustainable option for, say, drinkers in Oregon, but not in New Hampshire.

Easterners, on the other hand, may be better off with French Burgundies that were shipped across the Atlantic. Many wine labels list origin and bottling details.

For wine, though, there is no bigger emissions culprit than bottles.

Manufacturing a 750 milliliter glass bottle accounts for 33 percent of a wine’s life cycle emissions in North America, according to [the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable](http://media.wix.com/ugd/49d7a0_4d74ddfdfbd64d3a8c1b27c17f460e36.pdf).

Want a better alternative? Try bag-in-box wines.

Yes, we know. Quelle horreur. But the quality of boxed wines has been [improving for a while now.](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/dining/reviews/boxed-wines-review.html)

According to a 2011 study of California’s wine industry, boxes [reduce the drink’s overall carbon footprint by 40 percent](https://www.sustainablewinegrowing.org/docs/California_Wine_Executive_Summary.pdf). Boxed wines also last longer after being opened and the packaging is largely recyclable.

According to Dr. Kendall, the U.C. Davis professor, you can use that to help win over skeptics.

“You can feel O.K. about maybe going lower-end on your wine choices and tell your snobby friends you’re saving the environment,” she said.",9

I'm starting to put more time into creating my small home business, I'm going to start going back to the gym, I'm going to start learning to knit.

I hadn’t really been keeping track of the days, I just felt like I hadn’t wanted to drink. 24 is pretty cool though! I got up to 3 months about 2 years ago so taking it day by day. Feels so good to not be hungover. I suffer from a panic disorder and really was only getting anxiety attacks when I would be hungover. However, 2 days ago I had a full blown panic attack (panic attack is different from anxiety attack for anyone who is unaware) on the freeway completely unprovoked and had to pull over and put on my hazards. Hadn’t had that happen in so long. I’m wondering if my sobriety is playing some kind of part in that. I feel like I’m rambling. Anyway, just some thoughts.

For a while I was struggling to deal with it all mentally, but I feel a lot better now and feel ashamed i've been drinking to mentally cope with all this shit. While going through this, an amazing tech company reached out to me about a month ago and wanted me to interview for a specific position. After 4 interviews I was finally offered the job, and it's basically my dream job with a HUGE raise. So the drinking is going to stop. 

For the last week I have been drinking (2) cans a day of a 16oz. beverage with 10% alcohol content . What schedule would you suggest for tapering off safely and effectively? I plan on using CBD oil and I have a prescription for Clonazepam which I read was good for helping taper off.

At the first event, I had a Sprite. At the second, I had a glass of wine after agonizing for a while.  I didn't even like the way it made me feel. It gave me a headache and made me sleepy. Still, the alcohol made me want more alcohol.

When I got home, I pulled my roommate's handle of vodka out of the freezer. I had it in front of me for a while, agonizing more about wanting ""just one more"" since I had been so good and only had one drink at the event. Then I thought , ""What good will this do me?"" I fast forwarded to the next day, waking up with a headache and dry mouth and regret, having barely slept. I thought about all the things I have to get done today. I reminded myself that I don't even like vodka. And I put it back. Got a LaCroix instead.

I could be beating myself up for my ""slip up"" but instead I feel really, really proud. I had a drink and it's over. It didn't knock me off my sober path. Today I start again with three weeks of good work behind me building tools that allowed me to say no to a drink at that first event and to put that handle of vodka back in the freezer. I'm not weak, I'm actually a superstar. Day 1 again but feeling proud of how far I've come.",1183

I’ve already done this earlier this week in a more low key setting and I was around the right people.

I am in my mid 20’s, I’m single, and it really sucks that such a big part of socializing is revolved around alcohol. Tonight is going to be another test. I don’t want to just lock myself away in my room while everyone else is out being social and having fun. But last Friday when I wasn’t strong enough to say no, Saturday Was full of hangoverous regret. It’s a big part of why I was able to stay sober all week.

I don't know how to deal with this. My mom has been sick with huntingtons disease for five years now. It's been rough the past years. When I was 15, shortly after she got diagnosed, I started drinking. I'm not only daughter of someone with that disease, which is hard enough in itself, I've been mentally ill since my childhood, I suffer from BPD, CPTSD, Anxiety disorders and depression. I was never able to express my feelings or deal in any healthy way with the situation. There was no one there, my dad's been busy caretaking for my mom, my little brother was only eleven when the doctors told us.
Now in the past year I woke up from three years of substance abuse, mainly alcohol, and being suicidal to the point I would chill on railways. Anyways, my BPD was way worse while drinking. I scared everyone away. I did bullshit. Cheated. Tried to commit suicide. 
One day I realised, if I want EVER to be happy, I needed to *stop*. **stop drinking.** **stop cutting**. **exercise.**
So i did. I lost 14 kg, got sober, made friends, attended therapy. My symptoms got better. I started feeling better. I started being a better person. I felt alive, happy for the first time since my mom got sick. I've been sober to this moment right now...

Well, i got a call today,
she will die tonight.

 I have to say goodbye now. I am tiping this in the backseat of a rough car, with a german keyboard (yes, it's slightly different) 
My first reaction was ''I'm gonna go back to drinking. Fuck all this''
I don't know. I don't care about my future AT ALL right now. **FUCK THIS**

I still have the strong impulse to call the people I used to do drugs with. We did LSD,  amphetamines, MDMA, painkillers, benzos, Ketamine, everything back then. Until I stopped and got clean. 
I don't even know why I'm posting this. Maybe to calm me down from all the sobbing, plus we still need to drive a few hours.

I don't know what I am supposed to deal with all of this fuckery. Being sober. 

I don't think I'm strong enough.",16

Last night I did a search of ""resting heart rate"" and ""blood pressure"", and found that there's 100% chance of BP and HR improving. Resting heart rate dropped for a lot of SD users by 10-20 within 2-3 weeks, and BP normalized by the 2 month mark almost across the board!

I didn’t drink for the lovely taste of the wine, not in the last few years. I wanted to be tipsy (so my conscious mind said) to take the edge off. My unconscious mind wanted to be drunk. One or two was never enough. I needed three or four to feel drunk. So to sit at a restaurant sipping a glass of wine through dinner is not what my physical body craves, nor does my mind these days-it looks less and less appealing and more like pouring in childish, mind-numbing poison. That’s why I know I‘m full on done with drinking. Moderation doesn’t fill any needs or serve me in any way, the addictive part of alcohol pushed me past that place already. I don’t choose moderation as an option.

I can remember a few years back walking into a liquor store and feeling like I was surrounded by a massive amount of bottled poison. Being fully aware that even a fraction of all that liquid poured into my body in a single sitting would kill me. It didn’t stop me from drinking but I never forgot it. I’m now using that image as a reference point and consciously pulling it up when I am in a grocery store and pass by a display of wine or beer. Retraining my perception, one aisle at a time.",14

I have an amazing girlfriend... I learned to love myself and in turn realized that I can be loved by others too. She is supportive and amazing and is helping me grow every day.

I have a clear mind... No alcohol for 460 days has given me a clear and stable way to process everything and I am actually dealing with this much better than I would have under the guise of a bottle.

I have drive... I didn't sleep much last night. Not because I was nervous but because I want to work. I want to get my website, portfolio, resume in order and show this fucking city that I am god damn good at what I do.

A couple of “revelations” I want to share with you are that first, it’s never too late to stop, so please don’t let age or the number of years of abuse lead you to believe that you’ve missed the opportunity.  Second, at least for me, the one year sober milestone was the thing that finally gave me the confidence and resolve to admit to myself that I’m never drinking again.  I now know a lot of things about myself that are important in that scary decision.  I know that I don’t want a drink or two, I want to get drunk and I know that I like myself much better when I’m sober and, perhaps most importantly, I deserve to be sober.   So I’ve let go of the ridiculous notion that I might moderate my drinking one day. I can now say and truly believe that I don’t miss it and I don’t ever want even a sip of that fucking poison for the rest of my life.",143

I'm 450 days sober and strong in my sobriety. I have no cravings to drink even on my worst of days. I've been to weddings, breweries, house parties and more and haven't felt even a twinge of desire for poison. 

But. I'm a bridesmaid in a wedding this summer and the girls are planning a weekend away. I paid my deposit and just got the itenerary. It is literally 3 days, 4 wineries and 1 brewery plus a champagne brunch.  There will obviously be drinking going on at the house were staying at too. 

After much thought I told my one friend I don't think I should go. She basically told me to suck it up and that she was pregnant and couldn't drink for a girls weekend last year. To me, that isn't the same at all. 

One part of me wants to go and have a good time away regardless, but the other part wonders if I will just be miserable and triggered the whole time. I don't feel like I will desire to drink at all, but I just feel like its a toxic environment to put myself in for 3 days straight. I don't want to exclude myself based on coping mechanisms. I want to really delve into what would be the best choice.

Then I read about Alcohol Use Disorder and got scared. So, I’ve decided to shop using alcohol, weed, and even caffeine and added sugar. I want to get to whatever my new mental baseline is and work on myself from there.

You could go as far as almost fantasizing about it. Then I remember what I was like drinking. I was a rude, horrible person who only cared about his next drink. Was I still up at midnight looking in the fridge for the beer I promised myself to make a Sunday morning Michalada ( Idt I spelled that right.)? Oh well hungover me, sorry fiancee I'm going to be in a fowl mood until I can get a few more beers in me. Or would it be the I'm drunk and having my last drink around 10p when I have to be up and outta the house before 6a to go to work? Sorry bossman I'm hungover. Then I give thanks for my time on the wagon. Just wanted to vent a little. I'm doing fine now. My life has been better then it has been in years. Thanks for reading SD fam. I'm so proud of all of you. Keep on being awesome!

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning SD on this Fabulous Friday! Hope everyone had a great sober 24! If not, jump back on track! It is Friday so time to get those game faces on and have your guard on high alert! We will resist temptation together!

There is temptation to drink all around us! Alcohol is portrayed everywhere we look as fun and sexy. Alcohol companies make it look glamorous but we know better! I have never seen a commercial of someone going through alcohol withdrawals or in a hospital bed dying from liver failure! They never advertise the ugly side of alcohol!

When I quit drinking, research told me I would have life threatening withdrawals. Out of fear that would occur, I kept the rest of the bottle I had. I was prepared to go to the ER but in my pickled brain it calmed me to know I could take a shot if I got DT’s. My withdrawal was pure HELL!! To my surprise, no tremors or hallucinations though. Then knowing that bottle was here and I was Not going to drink it, empowered me! It weirdly gave me strength!! I now know that was what is called the “Pink Cloud”! I rode that pink cloud to dust too! After a few weeks, I poured it out because it is easier to avoid temptation than to resist it!

Do you want to share one tip for getting through a temptation?

\*Disclaimer: This was My experience only! I do not advocate quitting without medical advice as it can have dire consequences.

My week hosting is coming to an end. It has been such a pleasure! I enjoyed learning a little more about the wonderful people that make up the SD community!  Even though I could not respond to every post, I read each and every one. If anyone with 30 days or more of sobriety would like to host the DCI in the next few weeks, just let me know. It is a great way to give back to our community!",83

I tried to text my husband about it while I was at work, but he never responded. After work, we met at home briefly and I tried to talk to him, but he left for another scheduled activity soon after. He left while I was crying.

I almost broke down and made a trip to the store. But I’m glad I didn’t. I’m starting to realize that this situation was a big trigger for me today. I can’t let these feelings decide what I’m going to do.

I dont tell my kid that but it's just... im so mad at the world and this isnt who i usually am. Im usually that one person trying to make everyone laugh or smile.  I am no longer that person. I feel destroyed and like complete nothing. 



I finally showered and ate a meal after days. I took my kid to her doctors appointment and made sure she got out and played despite the stinging of direct sunlight.  

But i keep thinking about the bad shit. I battled cancer alone while you were in rehab and you even told your mom that you were drinking because i was diagnosed yet you still fought with me often. 


I found out the day before christmas that all my procedures worked out and i was cancer free and you were so happy. Fast forward a month later and you just fucking hated me so bad

But tonight everything in my house blew up when my oldest kid, now 18, had yet another rage fit over a video game, slamming shit around - then came downstairs right when me and my husband were in the kitchen and somehow this turned into a SCREAMING match between the two of them.  


My  youngest son has an anxiety disorder and has had ENOUGH of my oldest acting like this.  It triggers him and he has panic attacks.  It doesn't happen that often, and in every other way my oldest is an easy-going, kind, decent kid but this shit is SO DISRUPTIVE.  


I'm in tears, my husband (who is 4 glasses of wine into the evening) blows up, my youngest starts yelling that he can't live here anymore, my oldest locks himself in his room, and I'm left to try to moderate as usual.  


All I want is to say FUCK THIS SHIT, I'M GETTING DRUNK.  After all, the whole damn house is filled with wine, like it always is.  Instead I take a breath, I go through the same damn conversation I have with oldest son that I've had about this problem before but this time, I say you have to get anger management of some kind, and make real apologies (not just angry, spat-out ""SORRY') to all of us, especially your little brother, AND that if you cannot do these things, you will have to live somewhere else.  


I made it clear that I will help him find some kind of help, and that not living here is not an angry ultimatum, but a last resort because we don't WANT him to leave, but he can't stay if he can't change because he's causing too much damage.

Stopping drinking is just the start - we gotta stay stopped and with AA, work a daily programme to keep moving forward.

Here’s some stuff I’ve learnt about quitting:

1. My cravings continued 3 months after stopping

2. Ive had to address and do something about all the reason I became an active alcoholic.

3. Full acceptance of needing to be completely booze free. I NEVER WANT ONE. I WANT DRUNK. 

4. The first drink does the damage - if I have one, I have them all. I can’t get enough.

5. I justified and denied my drinking because I loved it and it was the best thing in my shitty life.

6. I couldn’t do this journey alone. I get to talk and open up and get support and share and let go of all my shame and get honest.

7. AA isn’t religious. I’m not into Santa Claus for adults either. It’s about me making my peace with life, death, and my constant existential crisis (just me?). I’ve put all that stuff to bed. And my relations and communications with myself and others have never been better.

8. I was a daily drinker. Now it makes me feel a bit sick - the thought of it. But I’ll always be an alcoholic - so I have to keep brushing my teeth by talking and having a daily programme.

9. So many celebs and people are teetotal. It’s so common.

10. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done. I don’t regret it, I don’t miss it, I’ve never felt of thought better than I do now. 


Good luck out there to anybody struggling.

I didn’t realise alcohol was keeping me stuck and was at the root of so much of my unhappiness.

It was as almost something stuck a cable inside my head and I could hear and see myself at a bar. It also made me re-think my commitment and forget all the shit experience of the past. As if it's going to be different this time. Sudden sense of fear washed over me. As if I realized I was being manipulated. I took out my first 24 hour chip from my first AA meeting and held it in my hand. Took a deep breath, and said NO.

Earlier in the day I got a call from one of the AA's from my home group. He was just making sure I was OK. Making sure I was staying sober. It was the first time someone checked in on me in a very long time. I was at work and it almost made me feel out of my element. We talked a little, I assured him I was doing good and staying strong. But then I got a text from one of my firends who invited me to go spend the weekend out of town. I think this is what triggered this craving. Remembering all the fun we had just six days ago. He knows I started AA, but I know that I'll be tested if I go. So I decided to decline the trip. Can't believe I am at a spot where I NEED to go to another meeting.

I was diagnosed with alcohol-induced congestive heart failure in the spring of 2019. I'm a 24 year old guy who began to suffer from extreme fatigue and difficulty with even very light exercise. I'm reasonably fit and at a healthy weight, so this was a little strange. Due to past psychiatric issues, I assumed that the symptoms were psychological in nature - sleep issues, high anxiety, worry, etc. 

Routine check-ups with a cardiologist are normal for me, as I've had a chronically high heart rate since childhood. I went in for an echo-cardiogram as usual - my heart had always been healthy at each check-in, so I wasn't worried - and walked out of the clinic with a surprise diagnosis of severe cardiomyopathy.  My heart's ejection fraction was in the low twenties when it should be upwards of fifty.

My doctor repeatedly told me that this was really serious, so I actually told the truth once the topic of alcohol came up: 8-12+ shots worth of whiskey per day, usually consumed within the span of a few hours at night. Sometimes I'd finish off the entire 750ml in one sitting. I was so used to it that I practically never got hangovers.

I was a terrible binge drinker, and I knew it. I was fully aware that I was an addict. I just didn't think it could hurt me so quickly. I thought that I had plenty of time to enjoy booze before I had to get serious about sobriety. People live with alcoholism for decades, I told myself. 

It may seem a little strange, but I was actually legal when I had my first drink. That's 21 years old here in the states. I had barely turned 23 before I was on the verge of dying young. It hit me hard and fast. About half of those diagnosed with heart failure die within five years, while only 10% live at ten years out. Many severe cases die within a year.

Medication was prescribed and was to be taken religiously. The doc told me that I needed to get help for my addiction immediately. 

I slowly started to get better. I'm quite lucky that I didn't have serious withdrawals. A couple of nights spent with tremors, but that was it. 

It took lapse after relapse after lapse after relapse, but I finally got to the point where I was only drinking twice per week. This felt like a milestone. Those were binges of course, but I was getting better. I stayed this way for some time. Eventually I celebrated a month sober before breaking the streak. I've celebrated one month a couple of times now.

Well, earlier this month I got the news that my heart failure is ""controlled"". I'm up to a healthy ejection fraction of 56! I'm feeling great and I've been told that I'm once again healthy enough to exercise. I've been grateful for my workouts ever since. 

Today I'm again celebrating one month sober. I just thought I'd finally make a post, as this community has been profoundly inspiring to me.

There have absolutely been some positive changes at this point, but mostly physical in nature, mental health is still a struggle right now.

So far though, I definitely feel less sick, more ""normal"". I don't know how else to describe it other than when I was drinking constantly I just *felt* bad in more ways than just feeling hungover, improvement there has been pretty solid.

I have more energy, and in general I would say I have an easier time getting out of bed. Though I have noticed I struggle more than I used to to even notice an alarm If I set it really early, or don't allow enough sleep before the alarm is set. Not sure If I'm just sleeping deeper or something but it's not really normal for me to sleep through alarms, and I've done so MULTIPLE times in just the last 50 days. Not snoozing, just legit waking up an hour later disoriented with a notification on my phone that I missed an alarm. Aside from a few incidents like that though, I'd say I'm generally waking up naturally and feeling ""awake"" sooner.

Cravings haven't *gone away* by any means but they've definitely changed in nature and severity. I *know* that as I'm wrapping up work (especially if it was a hard day) I'm going to go through a period where I want a drink, and so it's just a feeling that comes on and then goes away. Sometimes I want a drink just because, but again, it's just not the kind of out of control *urgency* that I would feel in the first couple weeks. I do really miss having a beer with someone and chilling, so unfortunately I've kind of been avoiding social situations where I might want to have a drink. It's still really hard to watch other people drink around me. Mostly though, I'd say I think about drinking much less often, and am no longer having the daily ""to drink or not to drink?"" Battle. Most of the time, it doesn't seem that appealing any more. 

I wish I could say that my mental health has improved a lot, but while there have been improvements, I'd still say I'm in general rather depressed and anxious. On the other hand, there are separate stressors in my life affecting that, and aside from not drinking, I haven't been doing the other things I know would help right now, like going to the gym and eating healthier. I've absolutely noticed that in the past I've felt much better, much faster by doing those things. I'm having a really hard time right now though and, for the moment at least, feel pretty satisfied with myself just staying off the drink. Sorry for the novel guys.

I mean that litteraly. I just can’t seem to stop counting the days. I had been drinking maybe a bottle of wine a night. For sure a bottle  every other night. I am a fitness instructor so it was getting out of hand. I think I’ve been a heavy drinker for 7 years now? I just couldn’t open a bottle without seeing the bottom of it. 6 months ago I started opening the second bottle and it took me a while to realize I was chasing the dragon. Alcohol just didn’t give me that warm and fuzzy feeling anymore. Instead I got heartburn and fatigue. I knew I had to quit. Tried once. Got to two days and a month later I tried again. I’m pretty proud of myself for getting this far. I sleep better (sometimes). As an instructor I workout about 9 hours a week but now I have so much energy, I just started a new challenge (CrossFit) just to get rid of it. I’m eating much better and smoke just the one sigaret at night but plan on getting rid of that bad habit too. Every now and then I get hit by this tidal wave and I just craaaaaaave a glass of wine sooooo bad. At those times I just crawl in to bed with my phone and lurk on this thread. It helps me enormously so thank you all for sharing your stories. Y’all helped me stay sane and sober. IWNDWYT",19

Yay!). I told my therapist the next session, and since then he has really been pushing for me to go to AA. I told him I had thought about it but would only want to go to agnostic/atheist meetings since I am not comfortable with the religious language most meetings use (and yes, I know you can use whatever you want as your higher power, but I also know that hearing anyone talk about God being the reason they stop drinking is going to be a huge turnoff for me). He said he's worked with lots of addicts and observed AA meetings and a lot of attendees in the regular meetings don't talk about God. Ok, fine, but since I found an agnostic meeting...why not just go there and bypass the whole issue?

Anyway, I did go to one of those agnostic meetings and I did find it comforting to be around people facing the same issues as me. But I don't know that it really helped me in any significant way. So far I haven't found not drinking to be difficult, and I guess I just don't want my identity to revolve around being sober. I just want to...not drink. I totally get that AA works for a lot of people, including my dad! But I don't know that I want or need it. 

Anyway...I said all this to my therapist and he keeps pushing for me to go back, and even to give non-agnostic meetings a try. The thing is that I want to talk about other issues (work stuff, anxiety) in therapy too and I don't want every session to turn into a debate about whether or not I should go to AA. Am I just being naive in thinking that I can stay sober without it? Should I find a new therapist? (But finding one who takes my insurance and was taking new patients was tough.) 

I would appreciate thoughts from anyone with more experience with sobriety, AA, and/or therapy than I have.",11

A therapist once shared the following exercise with me regarding forgiving others:

Pick a person you would like to forgive other than yourself. Start writing down all the things you wish for them...but write what you wish for yourself instead.
It can be anything...A.N.Y.T.H.I.N.G!

I wish for you happiness.
I wish for you health.
I wish for you to understand you are strong.
I wish for you unlimited puppy kisses on demand.
I wish for you a restful sleep.
I wish for you a lifetime of being free of alcohol.
I wish for you...

Just keep writing.
Just keep wishing for them.

At some point in the process it dawned on me...by showing some compassion to another (that I thought was unforgivable) I was able to find some compassion for myself. 

I am forgivable.
I can look in the mirror.
I can love myself.

I haven’t hit rock bottom 
I don’t get blackout drunk
I’m not that bad 
I still function 

I am not judging people who post things like this because at first I felt the same. I didn’t have a problem with drinking because I never drove drunk, managed to work out, I wasn’t extremely overweight, the list goes on and on. But the fact was I was killing myself. I thought I would puke in the sink each morning because of a sensitive gag reflex while brushing my teeth. I had chronic  diarrhea due to IBS. I liked wearing sunglasses INSIDE because of my sensitive eyes.

This is just a friendly reminder...all alcoholics don’t look and act like Homer Simpson and his friends. I was relatively in shape, ran 5ks, posted the right instagram pics, but I was still very ill. I think so many in society associate looks with health. This isn’t always the case. 

If you’re lurking and think I’m not as bad as him, so I don’t have a problem. I only get wasted on the weekends, so I’m ok. I could stop if I want to, etc. etc. ask yourself why you’re reading.

My *immediate* instinct right now is to grab a giant bottle of red or Bailey’s to sit by the fire with while I get cozy with my family this weekend. I’m not and I’m sitting here with my hot cocoa, but in the last couple weeks of Sobriety Attempt 2020, I’ve been noticing what a minefield of triggers I walk through every day. 
Bad day? Drinks will make it better!
Good day? Better celebrate with a drink
Boring day? Drinks make things a little more satisfying! 
Is it hot? Frozen drinks! Fruity drinks! 
Is it cold? Coffee-based aperitifs! Warm, desserty drinks!

I knew I could justify a drink pretty much anytime, but I didn’t realize how many specific triggers I, personally, had. I have champagne on Christmas, my birthday, my friend’s birthdays (even if it’s just to share via Skype), the anniversary of my Gran passing, and before I perform. I have lager (and pumpkin-spice beer) in the fall. I have Bailey’s and mulled wine around Christmas. I have crisp, light beers and bright, snappy cocktails in warm weather. Beer always comes camping or to the beach with me. If I have the house to myself for the weekend, it’s Prosecco, usually straight from the bottle.

I’m never at risk of drinking shots or straight liquor (not a fan), but I’ve made all these insane, arbitrary rituals for the rest of my life that I’m only just noticing are *everywhere* and, if I don’t adhere to them, I’ve convinced myself I’m missing out or not honoring the moment or some noise. What a load of lies I’ve told myself.

Anyway, I’ve been on SD for a couple years (new account) and struggling with sobriety for 16 years now and I feel ridiculous for just now noticing how tightly I’ve clung to these little rituals.

I remember thinking to myself how shitty it must be to deal with chronic pain when you can no longer use the medication that best helps manage the pain on a day-to-day basis. 

10 years, multiple stints of sobriety and several relapses later, I am now dealing with chronic pain myself, some of which is likely due to my drinking history. 

For those of you with chronic pain issues, how do you manage it? Obviously different kinds of pain call for different treatments, but I’m curious if there’s anything out there I haven’t tried yet. I take Aleve daily for the severe form of arthritis in my hip, use heat or ice depending on the type of pain, and have muscle relaxers for when my back gets so tight I can’t stand up straight (I use these very infrequently though). I was told not to do physical therapy for a while due to the bone issues causing my arthritis, but light PT has been recommended at this point and I already have an appointment set up to continue with that. 

I used to have a medical marijuana card for my state of residence but I let it lapse because THC-free CBD does not require a medical card here. Opiate painkillers scare the crap out of me because that’s what got me to rehab in the first place. 

Is there anything else you all have tried to manage chronic pain?",6

When I was drinking I tended to live a hermit lifestyle and would usually stay in so I could drink in peace. As my wife became more pregnant it was harder for her to go out alone with our 2 year old so they were forced into this as well. Now we spend the weekend at the beach, aquarium, zoo, and other fun activities. This is all thanks to my sobriety and there is nothing better than hearing my little girl squeal with excitement as the Pacific ocean waves cover her toes. My wife is happier and has been extremely supportive. She now feels much better about the upcoming addition to our family since she knows I'll be able to help throughout the night without worrying if I'll be sober enough.

This week I changed my workout schedule from after work to before work, I get up at 4am go to the gym then ride my Peloton and finish with walking our puppy. I now accomplish more physical activity by 6am on a Wednesday then I would in a weekend. My wife was ok with the after work gym sessions because it was helping me stay sober but I could tell not having me around to help her was getting more difficult.

It's a place where I felt the safest, my protective bubble where I spent many mornings, afternoons and evenings drinking on my own, an unspoken rule in my house was nobody bothers me when I'm in here so I knew I could do as I pleased without interruption. 

Approaching a month sober I began to feel so uncomfortable in this room, while on a surface level it was clean as I started to care more, but I knew under my bed and behind each cupboard door was relics of a way of life I want to separate myself from. 

Stains, cans, garbage, bottles full of piss because I was too lazy to walk a few steps to the toilet, absolutely disgraceful! I am ashamed but that's what I was. 

It took many hours over two days but this room is now immaculate, the burden of knowing what lied hidden, a representation of my lack of pride and ambition has now been deleted and my slow and gradual recovery has taken yet another important step. 

This room is a true sanctuary now, not to hide away from the world but to feel wonderful in after a hard day at work and get an even better night's sleep.

Sometimes reading stories about people crashing cars, getting DUIs, getting into fights, waking up with a divorce threat, etc. can lead me to question whether my problem is big enough. I don't get belligerent when I drink; on the contrary, I get super happy and outgoing. I don't drive when I'm drinking. I'm sure my partner is aware I drink a lot, but he's never brought up being bothered by it. It bothers me *for* him, but I am the type of person who's so self-critical that I struggle not to worry about literally anything I do bothering someone I care about.

I've not suffered any negative health consequences from my drinking that I can definitely point to. I know I am probably about 5 pounds heavier than I would be if I didn't drink. It would be nice to be leaner, but I'm not that bothered. I read in Alcohol Explained that drinking will reduce your cardiovascular fitness. That bothers me. My one outlet besides drinking is exercise. Deep down I'm not sure I believe it though. I worry about my skin, but I am also just getting older.

What bothers me the most is what I'm not doing because my main hobby is drinking. I've been having some abdominal pain which has me unable to do much exercise (tbd, but I do know it's not my liver), so I've basically said fuck it, I won't do anything. Now my drinking has ramped up. I used to read books and study languages. I used to play music. Now I just drink beers and sit on the couch after work, and lately sometimes during the day on the weekend.

It's pretty sad when I think back on it. I go to work and then I get drunk now. That's my life. I tell myself I enjoy it and deserve it because I work hard. I wonder how much my life would be different if instead of obliterating, I pushed through and put myself out there. I'm not sure what that even means at this point, but it's not getting drunk on the couch.

I'm still conflicted as I write. What else am I going to do with myself? How will I relax and unwind, something that is incredibly difficult for me? I do wish I had never found out about alcohol, but I'm struggling to find that motivating reason that will keep me from drinking. I do want to have something to look forward to and be excited about. Drinking on the couch is not what I want to say I did when people ask me about my weekend.

Tl;dr... I don't want to drink, but I do, and I don't know what else to do with my life.

At least, I am not going to drink with you all today. I already pledged that.",3

I find this incongruent with my assumed view of society in general, because it seems that it's touted and embraced as something that is a part of your adult life. It's marketed, and generally accepted in social circles, as something good, something helpful, something that helps with the daily grind and eases us into position of relaxation and enjoyment.

Yet, when I mention I don't drink any longer, I receive praise as if it's something that *they* should also consider doing, or a decision that they are envious of. We recently had a dinner party at a friends house and when I mentioned I don't drink, the wife texted me the next day saying she was proud of me, and that she really wished her husband would also do the same, as she felt it wasn't ""serving his life goals."" 

There's a major disconnect and schism I'm starting to see. Alcohol is so wonderful, yet so many want to get the hell away from it. Although, maybe this is why drinking is on a  decline?

so, i've largely been able to clean up the smaller things in my life, and maintain a healthier daily routine. things have been immeasurably better, and i am grateful for sobriety. i do find that i am slipping into a bit of complacency; i am interacting less here at SD, after a burst of creative energy i am a bit less focused. i noticed that several times this week i came straight home from work and started playing video games, and as my habits got closer to the habits of the drunken nights, i found myself really considering taking a night off from sobriety. last night i went to the store on a regular grocery run, and was stunned at how seeing the alcohol section struck me. after 4 months of barely even noticing it i practically made a b-line straight to the hooch. went so far as to pick up a can, but just to check the price. it was being advertised as .50 cents for like an 8 oz can. Made me think of ""micro-transaction"" in the gaming world, now it seems to have hit the drinking world. Still, i managed to stay dry, and aside from the initial pull, it was fairly easy to move on from.

so, this complacency. having cleared a lot of the small things from my path, i've been able to cultivate new interests, and spend some time trying to change some of the larger ""issues"" in my life, for better, or worse. with this complacency has come a tangible feeling of slow to no progress, self doubt, and probably a little anxiety. i wanted to take a moment to address my larger issues to put in perspective the things that have changed.

**my job:** as i gear up to start to job search next month (where do i even begin?), news came out that a position would be opening in the company i am wanting to leave. i would have been a strong candidate, and even though i am largely done with this place, and possibly this type of work the pay increase could have really changed things significantly in my life. like, real chance of paying down some debt before you die type chance, still, i was really conflicted about applying. a few days after the initial announcement that there would be a position open, the person who had resigned the job, rescinded the resignation - lol - no job to apply for. so, job search back on. as far as progress on this front; i planned a march 1st start date, and am sticking to it.

**friends/loneliness:** again, i was feeling little progress here. it's been quiet at work, where i get most of my interaction, and so things don't seem as energetic as they had been. I've been laying down for bed around 8:30pm, and just feel a general sluggishness, or lack of interest in the night time - could be dreary cold weather this week.

the new gym routine is going well, i am seeing some familiar faces, but hard to make connections without the ""group dynamic"" exercise i am used to. But, still making slow and steady progress on a healthy/fit physique.

i am still staying away from romance, but there doesn't seem to much interest in me from anyone that i have noticed - so, i guess that's the same, and is still fine for now.

I did get the phone number of a guy who works in this same industry. we talk quite frequently, and i've thought he is the kind of person i would like to be-friend; professional, thoughtful, sober, funny, caring, and just the other day we traded digits - haha - maybe we can hangout sometime. so, things moving slowly toward the positive.

still, i haven't felt overly lonely, or really lonely at all. the evenings are pleasantly quiet, and content, though i do feel a little bad about going to sleep so early, but it does allow me to get up earlier, and be productive before work - which i do like.

**creative ambition/hobbies:** i've been able to cultivate enjoyment from a variety of activities with all this sober time i have. i am reading a lot more, and loving it. I was writing quite a bit there for a moment, lately that has stalled.

i started to learn animation, and 3D modeling in a playstation ""game"" called ""dreams"". it is essentially your own animation studio - the things you can create in this game are simple awe inspiring, and the ambitions i have for these projects are lofty, and my skill level is beginner, so the gap between realizing the vision and what i can physically do feels like an ocean, and has me feeling some self doubt, and anxiety, and other existential bull shit that doesn't really  mean anything. I did have a productive conversation with a co-worker about this, and feel better just about experiencing the journey and learning something. i don't need to submit anything to the cannes film festival right away - ok - can we all just calm down a bit? :)

so, it's back to the basics. think in small chunks. re-dedicate myself to my ambitions, and writing in the morning for at least 30 minutes, spending an hour with the animation studio, understand that the small things i do during the day help me stay above menial distraction, and give me the chance to focus on larger things, while making staying in the present more tolerable, and not missing out on the smaller things. tall task, but i think i, you, we, are up to it

Another sub on here for intermittent fasting has been on my radar for awhile. It wasn’t until I hear a doc I respect talking with someone else about it. I then questioned him and he told me he does it and it’s benefits.

There’s a movie on Amazon prime called ‘Fasting’ that is great.

So I drank casually (another change) Sunday and Monday I started a 16 hour fast, 8 hour window to eat. It’s actually quite easy!

My weight has been a top struggle for awhile... in 3 days I’m down 5.5lbs. I fully understand right now it’s bloat and not drinking and such, more than fasting but it is so motivating to see a drop in the scale!

2020-02-20 09:01:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f6thb6/the_sleep_gets_soooooo_much_better/,The sleep gets soooooo much better,"One of the main reasons I never even thought about quitting was because I had convinced myself that alcohol was the only way I could get a nights sleep.  I wasn't completely wrong, when I was drinking basically every day, on the odd night where I didn't, sleep was a total disaster.  

I dipped my toe in the water not drinking for a brief stretch late last year, and the sleep was miserable.  I pretty quickly used the sleep thing to get right back to my old ways.  Not surprising, as my heart was never really into it.  This time I had a different mindset and I actually wanted to see it through.  

I had read from others on this sub about how the sleep gets better, but I was reticent to believe it would actually apply to me.  I was wrong.  The first few nights were rough, make no mistake.  I had super vivid dreams and even the sweats for a few nights.  Since 4-5 days after quitting, it has been a revelation.  I can actually go to bed at 10:30-11:00 like a normal person, be asleep within 30 or so minutes, and pretty much sleep through the night.  I never thought this possible.

I share this because if you are a person or a lurker who is hesitant to change because of how awful alcohol-less sleep can be, I want to be a(nother) anecdote about how it actually does change if you give it an honest effort and stick to it.

I don’t know how scientifically true that is but I do know that in the last few weeks I began to feel change internally. When I quit drinking I thought I would lose some weight, but I ended up gaining about 10 pounds because I had those nasty sugar cravings and I generally allowed myself to eat whatever I wanted because at least I wasn’t drinking, right? 

At the beginning of 2020 my wife and I gave up soda and most carbs (pasta, pizza, bread and rice mainly) together in an attempt to both shed some weight. She’s a dime but she supports me, so we’re in it together. So far I’ve dropped 9 pounds on my way to 30 as a goal. That’s only relevant because it is not something that I was ever able to do successfully when I was drinking, those kinds of goals would serve as fuel for the cycle of failing, reminding myself that I didn’t deserve to be successful in the first place, spiraling with beer and bad food, reaching a break point and setting another goal, rinse, repeat.

What seems to have changed internally for me is that I feel like I’m worth fighting for. When I leave for the gym in a few minutes I’m seeing changes in my body and I feel good and I feel like the guy in the mirror is a pretty good guy and he deserves to love himself and to be loved. That is a fucking HUGE change for me. When I get lunch it will be chicken and fruit, not pizza, and I work in a restaurant. The next time I meet with my psychiatrist I’m going to discuss getting off my anti-depressants because, and I know this may be shocking, but since I stopped regularly using liquid depressants my overall mental health has greatly improved!

This is a wall of text, apologies. I don’t post regularly, I use this group for daily reminders and motivation and it has been truly helpful, invaluable really. I guess I want to say thank you to everyone who is out here struggling and making progress even when it’s not a straight upward line. I’m going to keep fighting and I want everyone here to keep fighting, we are all worth it, we all deserve to be loved and to love ourselves.

Hope you are doing absolutely fantastic!,"TLDR: It is a bit of a rant, but I just wanted to share some of my thoughts of my life, the journey etc. If you read it, great, if not - I still hope you are doing great and all my best wishes to you on your personal journey!

I have been thinking for some time on what to share with everyone here, but have honestly struggled. The changes in my life so far have been so big that I haven't managed to put anything into writing yet, but hopefully I can share something here that gives something even to a single person here.

Gentlemen, a shot view back to the past (F1 inside joke): 2018 fall, I am miserable, lonely and drinking every day, in debt (but managing) and living paycheck to paycheck.

Today: still problems with my self esteem etc, but otherwise feeling good about myself. I have no job as I managed to finally get laid off (toxic work environment, feeling very happy about it). I have a nest egg of a stock portfolio worth 5 figures, I have zero debt and financially I am in the best place I have ever been - I can finally sit on my ass and look for a job that I want to do (never felt that way before, and it feels awesome!)

On top of that, I have lost around 12kg (combined from starting to eat better and exercising more, but nothing too intensive).

Perhaps it's the fact that English is my 2nd language, but I feel like i am unable to put it into words just how I feel, or the words of guidance / help I would like to share. 


I guess what I am trying to say is that try to believe that you really are in control - it definitely will sometimes feel like you are not but you are! You are the only person who can choose to be a better version of themselves. And change is not only possible, but it can be even easy (in a way) once your brain rewires itself. At first, once I was around a month or two sober, i felt extremely lonely, which was terrible. But it passed and nowadays I am enjoying my own company again (and of other people to a point)

For example: the best way i found for losing weight was simply to start writing down everything I ate (the app Myfitnesspal helped a lot, it has recipes and whatnot) in a day. That small change started to slowly change how I ate, not just how much. And after that, the weight just kept dropping.

Alcohol is so prevalent in our society that it makes me sick: for example, the other day I was listening to Ricky Gervais talking on the radio show about how he lost weight by still doing everything he was doing (including drinking a bottle of wine a night) but also exercising a lot. Now that he is older, he can't work out so much but still drinks etc, so now he is getting fatter again.
the two guys he was with, just laughed with him about it and joked about it too, and it felt so alien to me. It made me really sad for him, as imagine what he could achieve while not poisoning himself daily?

Overall, I really really never want to drink again (I think, This Naked mind is really stuck in my brain now and it won't leave, yay for me!), and sincerely hope I won't. Until that, I will not drink today or this week or this month etc etc. 

All the best to everyone and thanks for reading.",5

I'm 40y old, male, have always been casually drinking a couple of beers here and there, but from 30-35 I had bumped it to an average of 5 drinks/night. Then it was discovered in a random examination that my liver values were elevated, and at an ultrasound my doc said I have a lightly fatty liver. He wanted to check up on it a few months later, but I never did. He said to cut abck the alcohol some, recommended 3-4 nights off per week.

Since then I have definitely cut back. After time and the initial shock I am maybe averaging 3 drinks /night since then. This January I did a dry month, and as I turned 40 I thought I should finally follow up on the liver again. I started to read more about it, and the more I read, the more I am starting to panic! I had maybe 5 glasses of wine beginning of February, but quit completely since. I have never experienced any symptoms. I do moderately much sports, eat rather healthily (pescetarian) and am not over-weight.

I feel guilty and ashamed that I didn't take it more seriously back then. I am dead scared that my liver is destroyed. This week I have been a mess. I can hardly eat or sleep due to the fear. Unfortunaltely my doctors office is closed until next week, and also then I don't know how fast I will get an appointment for ultrasound.

Has anyone been there before? How bad does it sound to you?

I do drink daily and have been consisting fooling myself of drinking less by just switching the drink. If its not beer then its cocktails or shots etc. I feel as I'm in this place where I take comfort in the feeling of being drunk because time passes faster and I become so apathetic about all the things in my life that bother me. I don't even know I'm really even prepared or ready to stop drinking.

I am 49-M and had been drinking heavily since I was 21 (my first paycheck). Last 5 years had been particularly bad due to my switch to vodka. You can drink insane amount of alcohol in a short amount of time when you drink vodka!

I had tried stopping many times without success, longest probably 3 weeks so far. But this time around I kept at it with help of this amazing subreddit. People sharing their struggles and successes and failures, everyone being positive and offering great advice.

Thank you community, for making it possible for me to achieve longest sober stretch since I was 21! Hopefully this time I manage to kick it for good.

To those who are on their first day, I can say that it does get easier as you accumulate days. Now I get some days where I don't think about drinking at all! But on most days I still have to visit this forum to remind myself.",5

I felt like I dug my bottom even lower & didn’t want to wake up most days. But I had hope that if I stayed sober & kept doing what my sponsor suggested that things would get better. The book says “sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly” & holy shit did those months drag on. But finally these past 2 weeks have given me that feeling I’d been searching for in sobriety. I just realized when I got my 6 month chip that I hadn’t had a suicidal thought in a little while. I finally enjoy waking up again & going about my day. Sobriety is fucking amazing & I hope I don’t ever fall into those urges to use or drink again. Today I will stay sober. Love you guys/gals

Enigmatic at times but that shroud of mystery always became cleared after a few drinks. 
 
My sister and I fought last night because I couldn’t handle him being called an asshole and a horrible person for doing what he did.

Physically uncomfortable, my nose slightly stuffed and realize that its going to be one of those nights where thoughts race. Which is the beginning of an indefinite series of nights of insomnia. So i decided to get up, sit on the couch, open my notes app and start writing.

And so this story begins...... i guess for me its a story well too known but never understand where it will take me next, this time around. Its that ferocious vicious cycle of “fear”. The rain before the storm which preceded by a storm that just passed with a few sunny days in between. The thunder brewing in the background, flashes of light in the sky that warns you somethings coming. The warning bells ring and you have to hold on to something tight, ground yourself before your swept away. 

Life is complicated. And trauma, ptsd mental illness, and addiction complicates it even more. Knowing whats going on, being aware of whats happening is half the problem and half the solution. Your action or reaction to whats unfolding is where the story turns one way or another. The other half of the solution is depending on which way you turn.",2

I saw that I had to turn around, and did, and went way the hell around.

I'm 25 years old and over the past year I noticed my hangovers getting worse. My last few bad hangovers caused heart palpitations that made me sincerely think I was going to die. My heart would skip beats and then come back with a huge thud of a beat. This would be accompanied by dizziness, shakiness, sweating, chest pain, uncontrollable thoughts, involuntary body jerks and movements, you name it. Now I know these were withdrawal symptoms after putting my weak and desperate body through hell the night before.

During my last horrible hangover, I finally went to sleep at night after convincing myself that I would be happy dying in my sleep anyway. I honestly thought I would never wake up. Instead of seeing a doctor, I went to bed hoping that everything would finally be over. 

The next day I actually woke up. So I decided I would be taking a little break from drinking. That little break turned to 20 days and I love seeing the number of days slowly go up. I have booze in my closet that I haven't touched. I do think about it and consider drinking ""just one"" but we all know that's bullshit.

I have gone a whole year before but then I started again because I thought I had ""fixed"" my problem.
The year I quit was really awkward. Telling my friends and family that I quit usually got  uncomfortable because many of them are problem drinkers too. They would often get  defensive, or give me bad advice like I should just switch to wine and always have it with food, or only drink light beer.

I'm also a runner so this past year I have stayed quietly sober by blaming it on training. Whenever I wasn't drinking someone would ask if I was running the next day or training for a race. I always answered yes so no one pushed it.

The issue now is that I am turning 40 in 2 weeks. My partner is throwing me a party and I'm sure everyone will buy me booze. I'm not worried I'll relapse because the last time I drank I blacked out, puked in my hair and had to be showered by my teenaged daughter. 
Fuck ever feeling that shame again.

My worry is what do I say to people? 

Do I tell everyone I'm sober and I plan to stay that way; or do I tell them I'm running the next day??",10

You’d think I would have learned by now. After waking up this morning and finishing the glass of wine on my bedside - I could see myself shaking but hurried and sipped anyways before I could change my mind. My dumb logic sometimes is “oh I already had a sip so what does it matter drinking more because I already started the day not sober?” I hate myself for that. No surprise I snuck a few more throughout the day until finally I said to myself IM DONE. I even put that extra drink back. not that that seems like it matters when looking at what I already did earlier but I’m trying to look at it as a first step maybe ?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Thursday SD! Hope everyone had a great sober 24! If you slipped, jump back on the sober train with us! I won’t drink with you today!

We live in a world of immediate gratification, the world of the quick fix! High speed internet, streaming  shows to watch on demand, cell phones so we never miss a thing and have everything in our reach asap,  social media constantly rolling. We can pre order groceries brought to our car whenever we want, almost anything tangible can be ordered with the push of a button to be delivered to us within hours, including alcohol.

Sobriety doesn’t work that way. We have to go through the storm in order to see the sunshine.There is no difference if you are rich or famous. The storm is worse for some than for others. It doesn’t come with a one size fits all pattern. Sobriety can’t not be ordered online. Google can’t locate it for us. There is no rushing the process by paying express shipping.

Sobriety is delayed gratification. Contrary to what we are used to, sobriety is not something that can be bought. It is a healing process that takes time. Don’t give up what you want most, for what you want right now.

If you want, share just one gratification sobriety has given you?",58

* Seeking support

- educating myself and reaching out for real help this time has made all the difference. Alcohol disgusts me now, just the thought makes me ill.

- I was a insomniac train wreck for the first week. But I got better slowly.

- kindness comes in many forms and can turn a bad day into a good one

- tracking and documenting my day everyday helps me to look back and see the progress even if I can’t remember specifics. Apps help.

- I’m going to have bad days, and how I cope with them is key to never going back.

- when I wasn’t drinking I felt I was a good man. Now that I’m sober I will be even better, one day at a time. 

- If I have a bad day or a tough thought, blast it on here. I am not alone!

- look back, but don’t stare. Personal responsibility is important but living in the past I can’t grow. Shame and regret are not productive emotions.

- I can’t fix years of mistakes in 1 month. This is a long game so bench in. 

- I have to keep busy and accomplish something every day. Big or small I spent years in a rut and it’s time to play catch-up.

- don’t make up for lost time or feel bad for missed opportunities. Use the time and energy I have now to make new memories.

- asking for help is not weakness. I am not alone. People care about my life, even strangers on the internet. 

- don’t look too far ahead. Let this new life form naturally. ( I struggle with this one )

- helping others gives me a sense of fulfillment. Being grateful and humble are positive traits and don’t cost anything. 

- I may have started this for other reasons but if I’m not doing this to help myself then it’s not real. 

- alcohol affected the way my brain worked but I need to accept that I was that person who made those choices. I chose not to be him. 

- I am not my paycheque or my job title. Let go of the notion that you can’t be happy doing anything but what you were.

- don’t be afraid about feeling good about my progress. I can’t change the past so may as well feel good about the now.

- be totally honest, tell the whole truth. With my self and the ones I care about.

- accept that there is no going back only forward. 

I’m close to the longest sober stretch that I can remember, mostly because I can’t remember lots from the past many years but I’m hear now and I’m ok in this moment and maybe tomorrow I’ll be good and the next great. Time is what I’m working with. Time that I wouldn’t have had if I didn’t chose to take to off ramp and get away from that path of destruction I was on.

When I was down to two drinks or less a night, I started to notice a couple changes. (I’m tossing a couple good changes on the list to keep me motivated)

Changes to my body:
- Could not fall asleep. I wasn’t comfortable in my bed, lying in bed ‘sober’ felt foreign to me.
- My waist went down. My weight stayed the same but I felt less bloated throughout the day.
- My skin in general is tightening up.
- I have more energy. I’m waking up earlier on days I don’t have to get up early.
- I have more energy in ways I don’t like. I can’t fall asleep even after I got past the initial withdrawal.
- My... number twos are healthier... I guess... which is weird to me at the moment cause I’m used to using half a roll of toilet paper after each go.
- The cold sweats in the middle of the night... I wake up two or three times a night in cold sweats and it takes forever to fall back asleep.
- My tolerance for alcohol already went down. I would drink 5-6 drinks in two hours for a buzz, now two drinks in the same time does the same. My wallet is already thanking me.

Changes to my personality/personal life:
- This may be another underlying issue, but I remember everything! Especially the bad. Usually the bad just kinda drowns out after a night of drinking, but now I remember what happened, the feeling associated with it, and I don’t like it.
- I’m snippier with the people around me.
- I’m able to joke around with friends and have a genuine laugh while sober. Not that faking it cause other people are laughing laugh.
- I’m so bored! Usually the alcohol would drown out flow of time until it was time to sleep, now I have no idea what to do with my time.
- I’m a person of habit, and thrives off of a schedule. This whole not drinking when I usually do is bothering me. Thank god I usually start drinking when the stores start to close.
- I realize there’s suddenly more time in the day! The couple hours before I went to bed was drinking time and drinking time alone. Now I have more time in the day to do other things and not be tethered down by the time slot I set aside for drinking.
- Have I mentioned I’m bored? So bored! Help, I just spent the hour self reflecting and writing this post in an effort to motivate myself and waste time.",10

Kaiser Urgent care sent me to emergency because of how high my BP and shakes were. Off I go being pushed in a wheelchair by my amazing saint of a mother.

Got lots of fluids (banana bag) and an rx for Librium. Slept like a rock. 

Today I had a follow-up with their chemical dependency department. Doctor gave me more days of pills. Therapist was amazing and helped me see toxic patterns that made me feel like I needed alcohol when in fact I just needed to start away from the wrong people (simple isn’t it?)

I’m starting meetings Friday. Usually I’d scoff at them but this is now serious. Went to lunch with my mother and went to thrift stores and for some cute things. I’m glad this experience has brought us closer.

I’ve been sleeping all day and eating ravenously and I’m letting my body heal. I put it through hell.

I was able to hop in the car and drive to work and take care of everything.  Two nights ago I would have been too drunk to do anything and had to try and wake up early and probably still drink to try and go deal with it.  I'm not a believer in any higher power, but this told me that it pays off to be sober.  Also friends, don't trust any windows patches, at least until they've been tested for a good month.

Like 15 times (I’m not kidding) thru rehab, I finally found sobriety. I found something that worked for me. I started a small business to keep my mind BUSY and distract me from drinking. I truly worked! It occupied my mind and took away the obsession I had with drinking, like nothing else. 

So today, life CURSED me again! $@?&!

I still work my day job. I won some outstanding achievement at work and was invited to a fancy luncheon. I was semi-worried about drinking, but I shrugged it off and thought I got this. It’s coke for me. I went into the luncheon, saw my bosses and SR. Vice Presidents and was sober and held my head high and I honestly felt good. 

So then lunch was served. I was talking to my neighbor and I looked over and the server was refilling my coke. She was filling it from one of those little carafes. I don’t know why I looked down at my drink but I did and I saw the magenta color on the top of my coke. I honestly half knew it was wine, but I wasn’t 100% sure. I wanted too and debated calling the server back over to tell her “I think you just put wine in my coke” but part of me had just been served the drink I kind of wanted but wasn’t going to order. After what was a while I decided to take a swig to see. I drank, and I won’t bullshit you, I immediately knew it was wine in my coke. I SCREAMED in my brain. Mothr$&);)$! How does this happen to me !!  I don’t eat out often and who knows how I won this award? Maybe being at work? (See 15 times thru rehab above)

So long story short, I drank it. And of course by the time I finished it, well I had already had one so i ordered a proper glass, and had one more with dinner. 

When I got home I honestly told my spouse about the mix up, but didn’t tell him about the two proper glasses I ordered. 

Now I’m wanting to go to the liquor store. It’s like someone has relit the forest fire called alcoholism in my brain again. I don’t know if I should go for the bender, call my shrink tomorrow, drug myself to go to sleep, check myself into rehab, go on the bender or what. 

If you have read all this, maybe you have some insight. How can I settle my mind, sleep this off and wake up tomorrow and go another year and not burn it all down again.",14

Last December, my first love (a girl I had dated 8 years previously but remained good friends with) passed away from cancer at 30. 

This last June I got married (yay - so happy). In September, my new wife left me suddenly when I was at work (haven’t seen her since) and returned with a Uhaul to take ALL (I mean all) of our things (including wedding shower gifts from family members specifically to me and every piece of furniture). I slept on an air mattress for two months. A couple of weeks ago, it was confirmed she was cheating on me. And now I’m going through the divorce process. 

Life has been really sucky lately. BUT I still haven’t drank so I know this sobriety thing is working. Being sober doesn’t make life magic and rainbows but it sure makes it a lot easier to handle life’s curveballs. I’ve had to white knuckle it a few times but generally, time makes sobriety easier. Or at least more natural.

I’m good. I’m happy to be out of a relationship with someone who would treat me like that. I’ve taken the high road and i wouldn’t have done that if I was drunk. I’m sure being drunk would’ve complicated everything. And I’m truly happy, which I wouldn’t be if I was drunk.

I don't know what day I'm on, literally it has been so long since I've had a drink I have to look at my badge on here.

So the why do a re:    just to brag? Well here is things went bad.

I had another date with the really hot girl I was dating tonight. Things were going well but she posted on her snapchat that she got some good D!@#, and it was a good day. She swears she said I just need some good D!@# but her saying that on snapchat will get the dudes swarming her. The next post she said something to the tune of ""Can you have sex with someone and not love or like them?"" Well we aren't boyfriend and girlfriend but I confronted her because I felt like it was disrespectful..... and we haven't hooked up yet.

She said since we aren't exclusive she can do w/e she wants and that I just misheard her on the video. I explained it still felt like a slap on the face. Date canceled, I explained to her my guard is up super high because of my ex. Check my post history for that interesting story. She said she wasn't used to this anymore and wanted some space. It's been 6 hours and nothing. I fly out on vacation Thursday night, I guess you can't win them all.

All this to say, life will never be perfect even when you stop drinking. I still go to my empty ass house, and I have my stressful ass job. I'm pretty sure this girl won't talk to me because that's my luck with women.

If you read this far, I hope you can get a good laugh at my terrible luck with women, and I hope this helps you not drink because even the people doing their best still get $@#$ on sometimes.",3

My therapist was pretty shocked to hear this and she was kinda happy for me. However, I didn't participate in AA or Pagan AA or the recommended  (by her) outpatient rehab centers in town. I've been using the ""I'm Sober"" app to pledge daily and I've been lurking here/in the IRC to keep grounded.

Regardless, I told her about the app and she was like, ""cool."" She seemed really supportive, but then she told me, ""I don't think you have a reason to stop drinking."" Not as in, ""you don't need to stop drinking,"" but as in, ""you don't have any kind of accountability outside of this app and I don't think you're going to succeed in stopping right now.""

It was kinda a sucker punch. I've been struggling (read STRUGGLING struggling) less as the weeks go on - the *urge* to drink and to stop by the store or whatever is a shadow at the moment (I know it can come back stronger than before). But I've been trying hard.

It just felt... dismissive. I know 17 days is a drop in the bucket and tbh there's gonna be some really shitty days down the road. I don't know what I'm looking for here. Reassurance that I can do it? Some kind of encouragement? Tips on how to actually ask for help? IDK. I just feel burned after therapy.

I guess if you've read this far, share your favorite chili recipe below and if it looks good I'll try to make a plant-based version of it soon. Bonus points if it's spicy.

Today, I turn 27. The sun is out (a rarity for this time of year, at least where I’m at), I bought some books (the fourth illustrated Harry Potter and Everything I Never Told You), and got a haircut.

I feel so proud of myself for the past seven months. I never thought my life could feel so full sans drinking, yet here I am. Another year older and a little bit wiser. 

I am still wrestling with my triggers and letting myself feel all the feels when things get hard, but I truly believe I am the fullest and best version of myself when I am not drinking. Here’s to another year of feeling the sun on my face, ginger beer in hand, sitting outside with a good book.

2020-02-19 17:39:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f6isna/self_regulation/,Self regulation,"Morning of 17th day since last binge - feeling good about self and current effort, emotions levelling out. No desire to drink at present.

Feel that daily interaction here (among other routines) does help to keep issue front of mind.

Looking to switch to longer term AF lifestyle (rather than go back to bad unhealthy patterns after completing set period).

Something I have been thinking about (and have thought about during previous dry stretches) is that over time, I have come to rely on alcohol to regulate my emotions and feelings of self-worth.

What I mean is this:

-immediately after a bad binge I feel worthless and undeserving of love/success/fulfilment etc. I am desperate to cling to any half decent element of my life - I am grateful for the smallest show of affection or tiniest amount of responsibility.

-after some efforts to reform myself and the passage of time, these sad feelings and self-loathing start to wane. My self-esteem starts to recover and I begin to feel myself again.  I am in this stage now.

-after further time has elapsed and my confidence has recovered completely, I start to feel growing dissatisfaction with elements of my marriage/career/life trajectory etc. I feel envious of people having a drink around me - I feel unfairly excluded from this fun activity. Whether after completion of a set AF period or otherwise, this sets me up to allow myself to reengage with alcohol- either on that first occasion or after a period of failed moderation, this has always led me back to a bad binge, which begins the cycle anew.

This works out to be a roughly quarterly process for me. Am reasonably sure that this cycle has prevented me from addressing the (perceived) causes of my dissatisfaction directly. Some of it is bound to be the brain’s sneaky way of justifying another drink.

What I will need to do to make this time different is identify these feelings when they inevitably arise and to detach them from the craving to resume drinking. Thereafter, to put some proper effort in to dealing with root causes, rather than using grog as an escape.

I expect others have had the same experience- how have you dealt with it?",4

I didn’t drink, didn’t want a drink through the holidays, through the uncertainty of having a job.  I made it through my companies re-org with a new position.  I messed up the very first time I found myself alone, which happened to be a business trip.  Long story short, I jeopardized losing my job and my life in a city where no one knows me.  How could I let myself get to that point?

I don’t want to have a pity party. I’ve done that enough over the past 2 days. What I want to know is how to I keep myself accountable when I am by myself, where the only person who can stop me is me?  I have another trip at the end of the week and one at the beginning of next week.  How do I control myself? When I’m at home, I have my wife and boys with me, so even if I wanted a drink, it won’t happen, they won’t let me.  I have snuck around drinking my whole drinking life, so being alone is a trigger.

My wife thinks I should look for therapy for my anxiety.  Maybe I do have depression, not anxiety.  Maybe that’s why I can’t stand being alone without a drink?

Whatever I need to do, I don’t want to drink.  I don’t.",8

Whenever anyone mentioned this to me I just said ""that's too bad that that happened to her"" and changed the subject, not wanting to stoke the fire in the gossip engine.

Sober Christmas, New Years, various parties, bar settings. It wasnt all sunshine and rainbows. Frankly at times it fucking sucked. The anxiety, craving and depression faded day by day. I stopped robbing my future self of happiness. Largely because of sobriety I managed to land an amazing job, quit sugar, and become a more caring, selfless person. I hold no shame about who I was in the past. I needed to hurt in order to appreciate my current state. 

I’m not done growing, I’m a work in progress for sure. Drinking now would halt that progress completely, and although I struggle with temptation, in my heart of hearts I have no desire to drink.

I'm at a cafe I usually dont go to, in an area I used to live that triggered an old memory 'I showed up drunk to a piano lesson somewhere by here'

I cant remember what the teacher looked like, I remember thinking he was quite good looking. The lesson was at his home and for some reason he picked me up and dropped me home. This was about 6 years ago now and im reflecting. Did I ask him to pick me up because I was too drunk to drive? I cant remember. In those days I was much more careless and would have driven around the block at peak hour no worries.

I know I definitely tried to pretend I wasn't drunk. 

Either way it wouldnt have worked out, his teaching style was to ""ignore theory and feel the vibes of the music"" (shit maybe he was also drunk and stoned) 

I just taught myself to play piano instead because I could drink while doing it and could spend the money I saved on wine and ciggys.

I've been lurking here for a while, but never posted. This subreddit has been a major source of strength for me.

As of today I'm 29 days sober. I've been loving sobriety so far. I love having whole weekends to enjoy without blacking out, being hung over, or fighting with my boyfriend simply because I'm drunk and angry. There have definitely been some rough days, but overall I feel pretty confident about my decision to quit completely.  

But I'm supposed to be going out with my coworkers in the next couple of days to celebrate my getting a new position at another location within my company. Kind of a going away get together. A couple of my coworkers know that I haven't been drinking, but don't understand that I quit because I have a problem. My coworkers are pretty much all big drinkers, and we will almost definitely be going to the brewery up the road for this get together. 

I'm scared. I'm scared because I've started to rationalize having just one beer, just so I don't have to explain to everyone why I'm not drinking. Just so I don't have to hear my boss give me shit about it. (Which he will, in what he thinks is a light hearted joking way) I'm scared that I can't just have one. I'm scared that I'll fall right back into my old ways. I'm scared that I'll be too weak to order a soda instead.

Before stopping I counted several years of drinking everyday. On a normal day I would at least drink 1 liter of beer with a percentage of 12.6% alcohol. On 2 days a week I added 2-3 double vodka's to that amount.

I made a rough calculation... considering a normal beer is around 5% and  is only 25ml, the 1L of strong beer alone equals close to 10 normal beers a day, close to 70 beers a week. Adding the vodka's to this, it came to around 82 units a week. I thought I didn't have a real issue, but the calculation kinda scared me. 

Made the first week without major issues. On Friday in the 2nd week I had a glitch and consumed one whiskey. I could stop at one, but it didn't really gave me any satisfaction. The taste was good, but I found out that it wasn't the taste I was thirsty for, it was the feeling of getting drunk.

Yesterday I again had a small mistake, one half liter of beer, again 12.6%. And again the same feeling, it didn't satisfy me as much because the real feeling I'm used to only comes after the 2nd one. I'm glad I could restrict myself from adding another one (or 2).

Today I woke up, felt a bit less energized as the days before. Even while I feel a bit sad I had 2 drinks after promising myself to stop, this was a good wake-up call. I feel more determined now to give it another try and stay sober for a longer time.

Here is to hope that this helps. 

I'm a 28 year old Master student on my final semester.   
I started taking drugs in my early/mid teens, a bit more than the others but nothing special. When I was about 20 I decided that I would try to make something about myself one day and other drugs are very illegal here and would ruin any career so I decided to switch to alcohol since that was legal. One thing I seem to notice that is different about me compared to other people here is that I can have 1,3, or 7 drinks and stop if I want, this is something I do at social gatherings to hide my alcoholism. I exclusively drink like an alcoholic when I'm alone, anyway in the beginning I drank a lot during the weekends and then it started spilling over to the weekdays and you know how it is. But things really went of the rails about 4 years ago (At this point I'm drinking 6 days a week), that's when I really admitted to myself why I drink and that was my biggest mistake.

I don't drink to get drunk, I drink to get unconscious. When I admitted that, that was when I exclusively started drinking hard alcohol and if I started in the morning, noon or in the evening the goal was always the same, pass out as fast as possible.  My favorite thing is/was to get bottles of vodka, pour it in a sports flask and get in bed with my laptop, drinking till I pass out, and when I wake up I just continue drinking for as long as I have vodka left, which can be days. Somehow I have been able to sort of keep my life ""together"" and maybe a secret. I don't know who knows, nobody has every said or even hinted anything but I think some people should have figured it out by now. 

Anyway last July/August I went of the rails and until early February(?) I didn't have a single sober day. That's not that bad by my standards, but I really increased my intake, it wasn't 700 ml a day, it was 1L or even 1,5L (80-100 proof) when I wanted to have a really good day. I ate badly, increased a lot in weight, screwed up my studies (Which is a miracle that I have passed this long), missed/ignored so many great opportunities, and I actually got stretch marks on my stomach which I'm extremely ashamed of. 

I spent the last days tapering to get rid of the shakes and I spent all my money on purpose, clothes, food, headphones and I now have less than a $ for the next few days. I thought this would give me a good start, because now I can't get a drink for a few days even if I really want to. And I'm glad I did because I got some incredibly bad news an hour ago that really wanted to make me drink.

Here is to day 1, let's hope this works.",14

Back then, I would’ve spent the day one of two ways. One, I’d have drank all day (I had a client meeting! It was pressure! I deserve it!) and either waffled about my ability to drive at 5pm or decided I had to spend $30 on an Uber each direction. Two, I’d have held off drinking til about 430, then downed two glasses of wine because by 5 I’d have the shakes and welp, can’t drive when my leg is shaking so badly I can barely change from gas to brake at a red light. Or I’d have canceled plans altogether and put it off to tomorrow. Tomorrow will be better, right?

Now, I can safely get in a car any time of day and do what needs to get done.

Then I’d have been running errands, feeling disoriented and shaky. I’d have a couple of airplane bottles in my purse that I’d sneak into the bathroom with. They wouldn’t do much, but I’d think it helps.

Now, I can get things done, not waste time, and not lead people to believe I have some kind of horrible bowel syndrome by running to the bathroom every 20 minutes.

Then, I’d be thinking about my drive home. I need groceries, but I’m still shaky and nauseous and I’ll feel better when I can get home and have a couple of glasses of wine. But we’re out of wine. I guess I can swing into the liquor store (it’s on the way, there’s always one on the way). I’m out of airplane bottles anyway, what’s $25 on some liquor and soda?

Now, I can swing into the grocery store and pick up a few things I need. Maybe I’ll grab the large pack of chicken and meal prep for the week. Oh and we’re out of pepper! Good thing my memory’s on point and I think to get what we need. And maybe a few cases of La Croix.

Was it more expensive than the liquor store? Yup. But is it actual sustenance instead of poison? Yup.",11

I quit drinking. Not hard, in retrospect. Stayed sober. Not hard, in retrospect; for a while. I started drinking because I deal with anxiety. My drinking caused panic disorder and eventually agoraphobia. 

So, I quit drinking, but I never worked hard enough on my original problem. The fallout was all too inevitable. I wasn’t drinking, but I had awful anxiety and I wasn’t getting out enough to solve my deep issues. So, eventually, I failed. 

I’m currently working harder on myself than I ever have. For anyone that doesn’t know, to fix agoraphobia you have to do exposure therapy. This basically means I have to go to places that terrify me to eventually stop terrifying me. Think of what you hate the most. Now think about forcing yourself to do it everyday. That’s where I’m at. 

It’s hard. It’s harder than quitting drinking, but it is the only way I’ll stay sober; and truthfully, it is the only way I’ll ever live a normal happy life. 

For those that struggle; get help. For those that have been able to quit drinking; make sure you find out why you drank in the first place and fix it. IMO it isn’t good enough long term to just not be drinking, because the drinking will always be around when you struggle again.

Since way before Day One I have lurked and commented and occasionally posted. Thanks to all of you here for any reason at all. I like knowing self-care and kindness are important to other internet humans too! 

I am a writer and don’t enjoy working in coffee shops, but there is a “bottle shop” aka beer emporium with sandwiches and WiFi and a nice vibe down the street. It was also one of my favorite day-drinking hideouts, so I have avoided it for the past few months.

Last week I ventured in and had a salad and plugged in for awhile and didn’t feel any interest in the beer nearby. I don’t care for sugary sodas or bottled drinks usually, so I drank water. But like a lot of posters I see here, I’m bored sometimes of water.

I loved to drink IPAs, and like the tannic, bitter mouthfeel. Iced Jasmine Tea (from teabags) is a nice substitute, but I had wondered about the new Hop-infused alcohol-Free drinks. 

My bottle shop had a Lagunitas Hop Refresher. (Lagunitas IPA has a high ABV, so I was already familiar with their work.) Since I didn’t feel weird or triggered in the bottle shop, I decided to try one. The bottle looked like a beer, and it did feel like my old habit to walk it up to the counter and ask for a glass.  

I thought it was tasty and a nice change of pace from water or tea. It reminded me of Heineken 00, which I tried once a couple of weeks ago. (That had an odd aftertaste for me, but I liked the familiar skunky Heineken flavor and aroma when I was drinking it.)

The Lagunitas soda was a lot like a flavored seltzer, and was $3 at the bottle shop. The Heineken XX was $5.50 at a restaurant. 

I didn’t want a second bottle of either one, which made me think about how I believed I drank so much beer because I loved the taste. I couldn’t imagine sitting there and ordering three or four more. Insanity.

Some oldschool recovery types are grumpy about alcohol-Free alternatives, but I didn’t feel like I was substituting addictive behavior, so that was the test for me.

Anyway, hope this helps someone. Anyone else try a good hop-based alcohol-Free drink? Have you added those beverages into your routine? Do they remind you of drinking?

My healing process has been inspired by This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained, and the slow changes to my core belief system about what alcohol is and how it affects me. It took a year of actively experimenting with that knowledge to stop all that and get to 113 days. Feels great to wake up. 

I gave myself that to stumble and test the idea that a small amount of ethanol is okay under certain conditions and circumstances. For me, I have scientifically proven to myself it is not okay under any conditions or circumstances. So yay for that. IWNDWYT",6

I never realized how preoccupied I was with getting a drink.  It was this huge unnecessary stress.  Coming home from a long day work?  Have to make sure I stop and get that 6 pack now, wouldn't want to go back out later.  This applied to everything, always making sure there was a gas station or way to get alcohol on the way home.  I also only smoke when I drank, but that pull was just as strong sometimes, and navigating, making sure I had at least a couple black and milds on me before any outing that I knew would involve alcohol became such a burden.  It's finally nice to be able to come to and from places, and not have to either stop somewhere under the guise of something else, but always emerge with alcohol/tobacco.  
2. I've never been a morning person, and I still wouldn't consider myself one, but I'm finally not running around like a crazy person in the morning getting ready for work in 5 minutes.  This even applied to mornings I didn't drink the night before.  Drinking apparently just has a cumulative affect on your sleep, and after the first 30 days I found myself actually wanting to get out of bed 30-45 minutes before my alarm.
3. I'm guessing the cravings probably never fully go away.   I know I'm very early in the stages, but for almost the first 45 days or so after I made my decision, I was very confident and content in my choice and I didn't crave alcohol much at all, and thought I might be just ""done with it for good"".  Then some unseasonably warm weather brought back the memories of certain situations that involved alcohol, etc... and before I knew it I was fighting justifications in my head of ""just have 1 or 2, catch a small buzz and stop"".  Fortunately I think my resolve is still stronger, but I feel I'll always be fighting the temptation in certain situations.  
4. My fitness goals are now finally coming into the level that would meet my efforts.   I've always been a dedicated weight lifter, kept my diet in check, but I always discounted the alcohol as far as never reaching certain goals I had.  ""Oh it's not that, I'll just have to be more strict on my food or train harder, switch programs etc.."".   Now finally at the age of 36, I'm seeing changes and strength I haven't ever seen, or haven't seen since my early 20's.  I only imagine how my health/physical fitness would've went if I hadn't been poisoning myself multiple times a week for the last 2 decades.  Better late than never though.

This is my first ever post here. I'm a 29 year old man, and I decided to get sober in the middle of December, for the first time. Things went well over Christmas, and although I was surrounded by family and friends having a good time and enjoying alcohol all through the Christmas period, I managed to not have a single drink. After the holidays I went back to my regular life, and after a couple of weeks I started drinking again. The trigger was having a date with a girl, and when she suggested we go out to grab a drink, I went along with it. This led to a week of heavy drinking, before getting sober again. I have now been sober for 3.5 weeks.

I am finding that the biggest challenge so far is others not taking me seriously. I'll be at a social event, not drinking, and my friends/coworkers etc., will be urging me to drink. ""Come on, you can have a beer, don't be so boring"", etc.

I *know* that I need to stay sober. For the last couple of years I have completely lost control over my drinking habits. Incidentally, the last 3 years I have had my own flat and been living by myself. Freedom to drink whenever I want without anyone knowing. Having a couple of beers on a Wednesday to chill out developed into a six pack, into two six-packs. Planning to wind down with a beer in the evening ended with my waking up in my own sick on the couch. During family holidays I'd have to hide booze in my room because I knew there would be wine etc. with food and I could drink as slowly or as little as them so would have to secretly be drinking more. I'd go over to visit friends/family and see their bar cabinets and think to myself ""How is it physically possible to have a bottle of whiskey and not drink it up?"". I was drinking to handle stress. leading up to exams at Uni I'd be getting drunk most nights just to sleep through the anxiety. Which would just make doing well that much harder. I'd do things I'd regret, like sleeping with people I had no real interest in, ultimately just hurting them. I'd go to work feeling like death and just have to try to get through the day. I  would make up excuses to not hang out with friends and not do things I actually love doing, because they got in the way of sitting at home getting plastered. Frankly, there are so many reasons to get sober. Before alcohol  used to enhance things. Everything would be more fun. Now it numbs everything down. 

Before Christmas I showed my family all of the empty bottles  I have hidden under my childhood bed. They had been concerned for a while, and when I came clean and told them I have a problem, they were incredibly supportive. We have a history of alcoholism in the family, and they know how bad it can get.

My friends have a completely different reaction, though. When I told one of them I had to quit drinking, his reaction was ""So you're just going to stay at home by yourself your entire life?"", as if deciding not to drink was the same as giving up my entire social life. Others have said things like ""Ah, you're young, it's no problem"", or ""You just need to drink a bit less"". I am finding it incredibly frustrating. Especially since that's the sort of things I *want* to be thinking. When I feel like a drink my brain is telling me ""Come on, one drink is fine, you're young and should enjoy yourself"". These are people that I've tried to explain my problems to. I don't think it's that they don't want me to be healthy, it's just that they don't get it.

At work events I'll have colleagues urging me to drink because they don't know that I have a problem. It's not really something I want to bring into work, as I see it as a personal issue that's none of their business, frankly.

Sorry for the long post, just needed to vent. Has anyone  got similar experiences? How did you handle it? This is all pretty new  to me.

450 days today. Feels like a nice round milestone to give an update and advise on things I've learned, and changed through the process. Here goes. (THIS IS MY EXPERIENCE, MAY VARY)

1. It gets easier, I can't emphasize this enough. Not drinking at all, or even thinking about it has diminished if not completely gone away for Me.
2. Health improvements are bar none the biggest gain. No anxiety, no sweats, no high blood pressure pills, weight loss, elasticity of skin, looking younger at 44 than I did at 36.
3. Energy levels are off the charts, I can barely contain my surprise at the fact I can go longer, further, and with more enthusiasm on everything physical. This includes the fun stuff (sex) and the chores and hobbies.
4. Time is viewed differently, I can not tell you how nice it is to think about things without comparing it to when I shut down for the night, or the vacation because of drinking. I can plan nights out, vacations, camping, and events without worrying about a curfew for my habit.
5. Depression is gone, I no longer feel sorry for myself about anything. I still get bummed out, but I do not feel like it's hopeless any longer.

One ""BAD"" thing.

People who don't support you need to go out of your life, it's not possible to keep them around unfortunately in my experience. It's just a matter of fact, but I also divorced my wife and left my dream home over my adult step-kids and her, all who could not stop abusing drugs. There was abuse I finally identified through therapy and sobriety, but that comes with the headaches you'd expect. I never had a drink over it though, and I'm 450 days into this.

450 days. Wow.

I'm 100+ days alcohol-free and feeling good. All the positives are for real - losing weight, sleeping better, more clarity, job going well - but it has been a solid push of working, working, working on myself every day. Thinking, walking, working, reading, listening, running, praying, pacing, thinking, all one thing that starts when I wake up and ends when I finally get tired enough to put it down at night. I feel so much better physically, but everything is a test, my guard is always up, and I'm getting tired of hearing myself think.  I've been quiet here but thinking I should probably post my success.

Then, I got a call from my son.   
He's been using again. Lost his job, might lose his place.  
And right away, I found myself thinking about drinking.

Not that I want to, but that I *could*. Or maybe, that I *should*. It isn't like there's been nothing hard in the past 3 months, but I've mostly been focused on myself.  Now my kid is in danger again and I can't help him, and it fucking hurts. All day long hurts. And I just want it to stop.

Old me would have made this an extra-drinking occasion, up all night calling everybody who cares to talk about it, pacing and drinking and spilling my guts until I was literally sick, blowing off work and everything else. So messy. So pointless.

Instead, I watched a show about dogs and ate some extra desserts last night. Didn't say a word about this stuff to anybody. Now I'm about to go for a morning run, thinking deep heavy thoughts about my mom, who my son and I were both very close to when she died two years ago. She would have known what to say. I am so lost without her, especially when it comes to hard stuff with the kids. But she knows and they know and I know, IWNDWYT.",6

2020-02-19 09:02:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f6b0g4/1_0_0/,1 0 0,"First time poster here but I felt a milestone this significant deserved a post. I actually found this sub by accident while I was considering cutting back my excessive drinking and soon learned from research and trial and error that 'moderation' is a myth, or at least doesn't work for me and I would have to sacrifice alcohol completely. What a blessing this 'sacrifice' has turned out to be! While I have never posted here I read others posts every day which help reinforce my daily decision not to drink and comfort me by showing there is a like minded community out there which is mostly absent from my real life. I thought I would contribute by sharing some of the major benefits I have experienced in my first 100 days sober, which are:

\- Hangover free (no wasted days feeling terrible, never waking up filled with regret and dreading looking at my phone, etc) 

\- No alcohol induced anxiety from regretting your actions from the previous night or having to face people after not knowing how you acted around them the last time you saw them

\- Improved mental health (probably from avoiding alcohol/drug comedown rollercoasters and feeling more confident and comfortable in my own skin in general) 

\- Increased physical health and fitness due to not ingesting copious amounts of fatty alcohol drinks and craving and doing exercise pretty much every day

\- Saving sooo much money from not having to buy drinks and also being able to drive when I go out saving money on cab/uber transport

\- Increased productivity generally and being more invested in real life and hobbies (gym, running, sports, djing, playing piano and reading have provided great alternatives for me)

Some other stray observations: 

\- Although you change, the world around you remains the same. While some of my friends have been very supportive of me, most have been indifferent with some being downright critical which has taught me that if someone is attempting to go through a positive life change you should let them know you support them because hearing a little support can mean more than you think. 

\- Noticing just how ingrained alcohol is in my culture. I'm actively offered alcohol almost every single day. While I used to be a heavy part of that culture I'm now of the belief that every situation where alcohol is present could be improved with it removed.

\- You have nothing to fear by not drinking. In social settings if you can avoid drinking while other people are on their first or second (which is when the effects of alcohol *appear* the best), you will start to naturally relax like everyone else and it will literally not matter that you are not drinking.

\- I still like to go to gigs and nightclubs and even raves and if the acts/the night is good, not drinking will have no hindrance on your enjoyment. One of the best feelings is partying and dancing until five or so in the morning, then driving home and still being able to get up and function the next day when everyone else will be nursing a two-three day hangover/comedown. It feels like you're playing life with cheat codes.

\- I've had countless people compliment my appearance/fitness recently, including friends, casual acquaintances and even people who have stopped me on the street to flirt. And it's true, every day I feel like I'm in the best shape of my life and my skin is so vibrant and healthy, I just look healthier and stronger than I ever have before in my life and it feels amazing. 

\- My sex life has taken a bit of a hit (because I'm no longer going out every weekend trying to have a one night stand with anyone that would have me like it's my last night on Earth) but my self assurance has greatly increased and I'm very confident that better things are on their way this year, rather than a seemingly endless series of only ok things. 

Next steps:

\- I've enrolled in a postgrad that starts in two weeks, which is a career move I would not have been capable of before I was sober, which I am nervous for but excited to throw my full self into.

\- I'm going to continue pursuing my hobbies and see how much improvement I can make on them.

\- Continue to make good life choices and take sobriety one day at a time.

\- Looking forward to Day 101.

Thanks to anyone who read this post, no matter where you are in your journey just remember the most important thing is what you choose to be today. Even though you might not be exactly where you want to be in life and the journey to that destination may seem long and daunting, just focus on the here and now and make good decisions for yourself, because eventually many good small decisions add up to one big changed life.

So far, almost every meeting I've gone to except for one has been focused on Step 2. At first, I was really irked by this. The God part of AA has always been what's made me stay away. I hated the idea of AA and needing a higher power. I've claimed to be an atheist for years now. Now, I'm thinking something's trying to tell me something. I think I've clung to being an atheist as a way of avoiding wrestling with the idea of God/Higher Power/what have you. I think of myself as a very logical person and simply put, the idea of a higher power makes no sense. But you know what? I'm starting to let go of the idea that everything has to make sense. There has to be more to this world and its not something that I'm going to particularly understand. I just have to let it be. And let it help me get through this. I mean, I've done such a stellar job going it on my own /s. I've really enjoyed just listening to other people this last little while and seeing what the program has done for them and I want that. I think I'm willing to start wrestling if it means getting that something more that they have.

Here's why

I'm known by quite a few people in my personal life that once any % of alcohol gets into me.. I LITERALLY DON'T STOP until I'm plastered and can't remember a single damn thing the next morning 
(Or whenever I wake up)
But yesterday?
I was able to pace myself
I was able to recognize intoxication. 
And best of all.. the strength to say 
""Nah I don't want anymore"" 
The willpower to not have my mood turn from Cheerful AF to Grumpy AF
I'm learning to love sobriety ! 

I literally bet that exactly one year ago
Just around 365 days go
This week of February 2019..
I was drinking 1 or 2 bottles of Wray and nephew in a day (60%)
A YEAR ago when I had any form of intoxication. It needed.  NEEDED to end with me drunk. Puking. Falling. Saying/Doing stupid shit.
Looking at myself a year ago from today.. I can't process how I even enjoyed that..
I mean I lost 18 days progress and I'll admit I'm a little disappointed. 
But where I was a year ago,  
And where I am right now.
You gotta enjoy every bit of progress right?",4

When I binge the hangovers (especially the anxiety is pretty bad), but fortunately I never got to the point where I had a DUI or anything to that degree. I did notice the hangovers slowly get worse though. If I start limiting myself to lets say 5-7 drinks throughout the night (\~3-4 hours) and stop blacking out, will the hangovers start getting better? Is it worth trying to moderate to this degree? Is it possible to do this and still enjoy drinking after experiencing binging?",2

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Wonderful Wednesday SD! I hope everyone had a sober 24! If not, dust off, get up and start again! I gladly will not drink with you today!

The day I quit drinking, the negative self talk kicked into overdrive. That little voice got loud! You all know that voice that says you are not good enough. You will fail so why even try. We have all done the negative self talk and it can keep us from making positive changes if we let it. So I made a conscious decision to think positive. I said 4 positive things each morning. If you tell yourself you can do it then soon, you will believe it! Anytime a negative thought snuck in, I imagined a stop sign and stopped it. I named my little voice Lying Lucy. I would say Lying Lucy,  there you go making up lies again! Yes, I talked back to her! (FYI do not do this when others are present, Lol) That made me say the thought out loud and release it to the universe! I know it sounds crazy but those little things helped me get through some real hard times. The positive self talk made me start to believe I would succeed one day at a time! Even after all this time ole Lying Lucy will pop in on occasion to say, you have done so good, you deserve a drink or you can have just one after all this time. I just say Lying Lucy you will always be a big fat liar so Shut the @#%& up!!!

If you have a tip that helped you on your journey and you want to share, it could maybe help someone that is struggling today.",82

I’ve known I have a problem for a long time, but I’m really good at downplaying, making excuses, negotiating, and just generally convincing myself that I don’t need help—that I can do it on my own and “this time will be different.”

I’ve quit and tried to moderate many times, but I always seem to end up right back where I started or worse. This time, I went looking for help. 

It took a lot for me to nut up and go, but I am so glad I did. Everyone was so welcoming and a lot of people had a (surprisingly) helpful piece of advice to share with me.

I’ve read about a lot of negative experiences and bad vibes, but I feel really lucky that I happened to find a great first meeting.

And I don't particularly care because I'm depressed about my sense of isolation in the world and my dead-end job and generally dead-end life situation. It would be so nice for people to give a crap about me instead of being judgy over whether I'm ""anxious,"" of all things. Of course, I'm anxious. I'm anxious, I'm depressed and I'm going through one of those times where my energy is low, so it's hard for me to even focus on the outside activities that help me stay sober.",9

Things are now miserable again. We are far from the AA that we used to love going to multiple times a week and I am on day 1. I don't have any cravings as I am just trying to get my wife to feel better. She has now missed her second day of work and already called in sick for tomorrow.

I black out and now that I’m taking antidepressants I behave really dangerously if drunk. I have decided to stop drinking because I would hurt people when drunk, say nasty stuff, remember nothing the next day and then live with crippling anxiety for a week. I’ve been sober 35 days. I was doing fine until I got this news. I just want some wine and something to distract me.

I’m 22 now and far away from school, but I just got the news today that he was busted for creating and distributing child porn. He would take pictures of us in the girls’ changing rooms and toilet stalls with micro cameras he had hidden around the school. Apparently,  he posted it in some pedo groups on the deep web. My gut reaction was to throw up. He was my history teacher when I was just a kid and I barely remember the classes, just that I hated going to them and that he made me really uncomfortable. I think he has photos of me as a child that could have been used for the sort of material he produced. I’m almost certain. And if he does, they’re on the internet and God knows how many creeps have gotten off to them. 

I just really want a drink and to pretend this did not happen.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support. I ended up ok. I’m 36 days sober now :)

I’m going to take all this to therapy tomorrow and talk to my friends from school. Everyone is shocked and disgusted. But I’m ok. Thanks for being such a great community!",5

2020-02-18 21:49:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f63yaq/life_without_booze/,Life without booze,"Tomorrow I will have gone without alcohol for 31 days. Ten years ago I went 30 days, which was the longest I had gone without drinking since I was a teenager. I'm approaching the age of 50.

This time around I'm not drinking because I am talking an anti-fungal medication to clear up a minor skin thing. Terbinafine.  It works through the liver. Ergo no booze.  At first I didn't want to take it because I didn't want to give up my nightly bourbon(s) and weekend wine.  But then I thought, fuck it.  It's only 90 days.  Got a really nice bottle from Napa waiting for me when this is over. I can do this.

After 30 days, I don't plan on drinking again.  I realized that about a week in.

Am I an alcoholic? I don't know. Don't really care about what you call me. Never had a rock bottom. No DUIs. No missed work, no relationship-ending arguments or behavior. Liver function normal (ALT and AST both in the mid-twenties) as of two weeks ago. I'm blessed in that sense, no doubt, and grateful for it. But I've always known I \*probably\* drink too much out of a habit it's taken decades to perfect.

And now...four weeks in, I'm sleeping through the night, every night, 7.5 to eight hours. I'm not irritable at all any more.  I look forward to getting in bed and reading (as opposed to falling asleep on the couch with the TV on with my wife continually rousing me until I come to bed).  I wake up the minute I wake up every morning.  I feel good from the morning to the night.  I'm enjoying the freedom to drive (at night) that I haven't felt since I got my license almost 35 years ago.

I travel a lot for work.  Airliner upgrades to business class and airport lounges.  Hotel bars. Expense accounts.  Unlimited free booze for the asking. I thought that would be toughest part.  But I've spent nearly half of the last 30 days on the road for work or personal travel, and it hasn't been a challenge. It's because I just don't want to drink any more.  I did when I stopped. But now I don't.  I've realized that life without booze is better than life with it.  The fog you hear about is real, but you probably can't see it until you've emerged from it.  I know I couldn't.  I had forgotten what normal (sober) was. But I see it now, as clear as daylight.  Life without booze is better than life with it, at least for me.

If you're like me, a \*highly\* functional alcoholic, or maybe, like me, not an alcoholic but unquestionably a drinker, I'd encourage anyone who thinks booze might be too much a part of their lives to give it a week or two and see if the moments that make up your day shine a little bit brighter. Good luck.",197

My sober journey started back in 2017 but I'll share about that another time.
  I've had some ups and downs but the latest is that I've was caught secretly drinking by my partner after I relapsed over Christmas... A whole big resentment thing over not being normal I think... Anyway I got back in touch with my sponsor and we've agreed to really work the steps on my return from this trip. 

Thinking I'd be fine not drinking as my partner is with me for the 2 weeks, and it would be a great way to stay dry for a fortnight, I didnt give it a secound thought... 
Until tonight, which is day 6, and I was sooo close to bloody 'shoplifting' a bottle of vodka from the supermarket so I could sneak a drink in my diet coke later, its scared me!  
I never even drank vodka!  Or stole anything for that matter... 
All afternoon I've been plotting ways I can sneak off and get a drink.
This really has came out of no where today and due to the time difference back home I've no one else to get this off my chest to so I just thought it would help to write this out... Sorry for the long text.",3

Last bar my friends left me talking to this lady who I then realized was either homeless or was a prostitute. I left the bar quick and went to my favorite shit hole bar. Took money out in case I could find the guy that sold stuff. As I stood there swaying like an idiot, I downed my second vodka. Then a sudden realization came to me that this is fucking stupid. I was by myself. I wasn't having any fun. And I was about to make my whole weekend turn into shit. I sat my drink down and called a Lyft. I thought about stopping at a store on the way to get more booze, but decided not to. Just went home and went to sleep. Woke up feeling like shit. But happy at the same time, because it could have been way worse.

I knew I was an alcoholic for a very long time. But always considered it as my ""cool"" lifestyle. But then I couldn't recall the last time I was having a blast because I was drunk. Why am I buying drugs again so I can just drink more? I made a post earlier about how to find AA meetings that were late at night. Last Saturday I clicked on the link that someone commented. So that night I found a meeting that was late at night. It was either that or go get drunk again and be alone, again. I always had a stigma about the ""god"" use in AA. But said fuck it and just went. 

9:30 PM Saturday Night I was on my motorcycle. Palms sweating. Eyes tearing. As I got close I almost wanted to turn around. But I just twisted the throttle and gunned it. Found where the meeting was and just sat down. Not knowing what to expect. 

10 PM I was surrounded by people I didn't know. I was handed a laminated page to read. Later I found out I was suppose to read it to the group.

Everyone noticed me there, sitting in the back. They shook my hand and we got to know each others name. My instinct told me to not trust anyone, they want something from me, this is a scam, this is a god cult. But after hearing the speaker, and some of others sharing their struggle, I felt something I haven't felt in a while. That night I went home and slept sober for the first time in months.

Next day I woke up rested. No hangover. Cash still in wallet from Friday night. I decided to fix my bed, clean, do my laundry, go to the gym. I don't remember last time I went to the gym on a weekend. Same night I went to two meetings. Met some great people who gave me their contacts, just in case. 

So now I am on my day 4. Going to the gym and then going to a meeting. Again. 

That self-hatred, anger towards the world, the sense of loneliness is fading away. The bags under my eyes have almost vanished. That anxiety that was only ""cured"" by booze when talking to others isn't present. I no longer feel alone in this world. And that's something a bar tab can't substitute.

Did I start believing in god and praying? No. Do I realize that I was a selfish self centered asshole. Yes.",18

Heading into the evening, I already made the decision that I would be driving home later that night. This isn't a rare event for me as of late and I caught myself a DUI four years ago. We both lost control and stumbled back to his house to continue drinking. Then I'm phasing back out of a blackout going 75mph on the highway at 2:30am, an hour in the wrong direction, my car sputtering to a halt because I ran out of gas. Luckily I have AAA but my phone was dead so I had to flag down someone to help, which ended up being a car of sweet college kids. Luckily. 

My luck will run out, and not by my choice. I am terrified of my drunk self. I do not have the capacity to have just one or two and have a safe, enjoyable night out. I black out very quickly and I'm becoming more and more active during that space when my sobriety is absent. So many times I've been in and out of blacking out in a panic, almost frantically looking for someone or something that really isn't there. 

This past Christmas I was really proud of myself for not overdoing it with my family like I normally do, until the last night. Found myself wine drunk and out for a walk in the snowy woods of Wisconsin by myself in the middle of the night. I remember sort of gasping and looking around in the cold dark to get my bearings, then seeing the cabin lights down the road in the distance. 

In the mornings after incidents like this I have paranoid thoughts that the police are looking for me or I've woken up in jail with someone's blood on my hands. The anxiety spiral of drinks regretted, things I could have said and done that I don't remember - booze is sneaky and will kill me with no remorse if I don't stop. 

Why do I drink like this? Where is this dangerous and mindless behavior rooted within me? Looking for advice to help find those answers and to have a better understanding of myself.

I’m coming out of a relapse after being sober for three years and I know, deep down, even though I don’t want to admit it, that the relapse happened because I took my sobriety for granted. I’d stopped going to meetings. I stopped reaching out for support. I stopped paying attention to the alcoholic voices getting louder in my head. 

But you know what I did do? I schemed and planned and hid and strategized and put loads of effort into figuring out how I could get my next drink. It consumed my thoughts and actions. I gave alcohol my 100% full attention. 

So it should be no surprise that a disease that requires *so much* attention to nurture requires even just half that much attention to control, yet I treated it like an afterthought - a thing I’d conquered after enough time sober and could just ignore for the rest of my life. 

My alcoholism may not look like yours and I recognize that we may all have our own approaches to sobriety, but this realization has hit me like a ton of bricks and I hope it’s something I remind myself of daily for the rest of my life.

Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I have been trying for about 6 months to quit drinking. It’s progressively gotten way worse. I “tried” to taper, to no avail. I’ve told my SO, my friends and family quit dates that I just blew through without even trying. I just can’t stop. 

So after a massive fight this weekend with my SO and even more reflection, I’m checking my self into a detox unit tomorrow. I had to talk to my bosses at work and try to explain it in the vaguest terms possible, for obvious reasons. That wasn’t fun. 

Well anyway, I’m terrified. I’ve been to inpatient twice before 12 and 15 years ago, but for opiates. I’ve never done this type of thing just doing detox and I have read a lot of horror stories online. I drink quite heavily, 12-18 a day depending on the day. At that level for probably a year, not as bad before that, but still a lot and still everyday. I can feel my body starting to suffer and fail, and I won’t want to die. 

Anyone who’s been to detox have any light to shed on the experience? This facility is pretty bourgeois and it will be a medical detox. I just have no idea what to expect!

It was one of my friend's birthday yesterday. We visited a few breweries and had one drink at each. In about 8 hours I had one drink every hour. I took a cab home and my memory is quite blurry of anything that happens after this. I came home around midnight. After talking to my girlfriend and joking with her she tells me that I fell asleep on the couch. I have no memory of most of the things that happened until the morning. She said that I was in a very cheerful mood. 


Now this is from putting pieces together and my girlfriend telling me what happened later in the morning.



About half an hour after passing out on the couch I woke up. Then I stood outside our bedroom and started yelling at the door of our laundry room. Then I repeatedly punched it until there was a hole in it. My girlfriend thought I was throwing up or I needed help so she brought a towel. She tells me that I threw the towel into the laundry basket without doing anything about it. I apparently told her to stay inside and not come out of the bedroom. Then I threw our TV to the wall and cracked it which also put a small hole in the wall. For some reason I also poured the water inside a vase down on our carpet where I was punching the door. 

I woke up at 7 to see all this mess and having no memory of the whole thing. It seems like I just went back to sleep like nothing happened. There was blood on my hand from having punched the door and some cuts on my other hand. When I woke up my first thought was is my girlfriend OK? I ran to the bedroom from the couch where I had been sleeping. I asked her if she was OK or if I did anything to her. She then told me the story and said that she was a bit shook. We both had to go to work. So we could only briefly talk. I couldn't hold back my tears when she tried to console me saying that I was probably very stressed and I had to let it out. She hugged me and told me that it was done and I would be OK. 


I have so many questions and can't find any answers to them. 
I don't know what I was thinking or what got me to do all this. 

I'm a man in his 30s, living with my girlfriend whom I love more than anything else in the world. I have a stressful job and I've been through a lot in the last few months. We've been through a lot together as well. I have no past incidents of aggression after drinking. I'm usually a very happy drunk not that I get drunk often.  


I am so disappointed in myself and ashamed. I don't know where to begin putting this puzzle together. I am at work and I feel traumatized my the whole incident. I don't know how this is going to affect our relationship. I don't know if I'll ever do anything like this again? I don't know what triggered me to act this way. 


It all feels like I was in a nightmare but it was all real. Is this a sign of a mental disorder? I'm considering going sober for the rest of my life. I want to have a family and kids. I cannot put anyone in danger like this. 

How do I put this behind me and move forward?",7

Thinking about doing it.  No one has told me to but it makes sense to eliminate all sugar/carbs. 

If a person changes to an full fat diet, in addition to no carbs, they body becomes ketogenic. Your body will then stop craving sugar/carbs and switch over to burning fat.  

This in turn would reduce alcohol cravings? Might give it a shot.",3

Not a big one, just a few beers, then went all week with nothing then thought what the hell on Saturday night. I had drunk 4 beers and thought I felt fine. I was at home and my kids were in. I was having fun with them when my son said something I didn’t like and I apparently turned into a moron in a split second.

Not physical or overly abusive, but I just became a bit of a twat and must have realised it as I attempted to sit down and try to calmly rationalise my behaviour to my kids when in fact I just dig myself deeper.

I then proceeded to drink 4 more beers while thinking I was right but also must have sensed I was wrong really as I just disappeared and watched a film . Then, when I was actually drunk, I popped my head in and half apologised, but knew it wasn’t a proper apology.

Next day neither kids were talking to me so I left it a while and later in the day apologised for my behaviour.

When I was halfway through those 8 beers, I genuinely thought I just felt normal, but I now know that my self perception was way off and I was in fact partially inebriated.

This is just a note to self really so i can look back at my reddit posts when I fancy a drink and know that it’s likely a moron will appear as a result.

Tomorrow I'm facing the music. For the first time when the doctor's office asked if I needed to talk about anything I said, ""Health concerns related to alcohol abuse."" It felt weird to hear myself say it.

Here I am hungover again.  VERY hungover.  

Of course if I could drink just 2 or 3 drinks (I can't), I wouldn't get hungover.  When I'm hungover, come mid afternoon a couple of beers to chill the hangover call me.  Which like trying to just have 2 or 3 fails, so does just enough to reduce the hangover.  So I end up wasted - again.  

I'll keep saying it because it's true - at least I finally have admitted to myself I must stop booze.  I've admitted to myself I am not capable of moderation.  And at least I'm down from drinking 4, 5, or 6 days a week to staying dry for a week or two, sometimes four.  Then having 2 or 3 days of boozing.  Then another dry streak.  

But it sucks.  I can't lose weight when I'm drinking.  My sleep goes whacky.  The hangovers are atrocious.  

My truths are they I can NOT moderate, I'm happier sober, and I must stop - 100%.

2 hours later my wife would be walking the other couple (neighbors and friends of ours) home when they literally stopped functioning. They were fall-down drunk. She even took a picture of this couple laying on the ground at one point.

My Dad died an alcoholic, a week before my daughter was born.  I needed to break the cycle for my family.  Quitting drinking was something I wanted to do with him or at least on my own to show him it could be done.  I like to think he's proud of me for this.

Money.  In the beginning money had nothing to do with it but as the year has gone on I noticed my monthly budget was much easier to stick with.  I guess knocking $26 a day off will help that.  $9490 I've saved this year.  

I hadn't felt happy or pursued a dream in years, I had forgotten who I was.  It was one of the earliest things to return during my sobriety.  It was so nice to meet myself again.  I dont like thinking about the bad drinking brought me, I just focus on the positive.  I am not that person anymore.

Anyway I'm new to sobriety (just about at a month and a week). I guess I kind of started this journey back in early December with a trip to detox, then back to drinking, then back to detox, then a little more drinking, then a short stay in rehab. Maybe I just didn't find the right rehab. I finally found an awesome IOP though. I wanted to stop drinking before, but there was a little part of me that always wanted that one last day of drinking, which I realized never worked and would always lead me back to daily drinking. I drank one day during the first week of the IOP, and the next day decided to give sobriety 100% of my effort. Not sure what changed; I guess some part of me really wanted to finally be sober and move forward with my life.

I'll get to the fitness part in a minute. While drinking, I basically wouldn't eat. Maybe a slice or two of pizza. My stomach was always a bit uncomfortable in the morning, and I would start drinking shortly after getting up, so I wouldn't be hungry. My calories mostly came from vodka and soda. All I did was drink and sit on the couch. I was up to a bottle of vodka per day, maybe more if I wasn't completely exhausted and falling asleep by dinnertime. When I finally got to detox I had lost 15 pounds (I have a pretty fast metabolism and have always had a tough time keeping weight on).

Now to the getting back in shape part. It's been pretty horrible. In addition to simply being in horrible shape from drinking and remaining sedentary all day every day, I think when I wasn't eating my body was breaking down the little muscle I had for energy. I feel worse now than I did when I was drinking. Exercise has been a huge part of staying sober this past month, so I have to keep it up. I need something to focus my energy on, and it really helps with cravings. I know it will get easier, but it's tough. It's also a bit depressing to see just how much my physical health has deteriorated these past 5-6 years.

Anyone have any experience with not only being in bad shape, but being in even worse shape as a result of drinking? Any advice on a quicker recovery?

Thanks for reading. I know this was a long post. It feels good writing this though.",3

I feel like such an asshole, but despite all the opportunities to drink and no one really stopping me, I fought against it. They probably would have encouraged me to do it so I would get over myself and calm down from the big emotions I was feeling. Not using something to numb frustrations is hard! I didn’t realize how much I was numbing them until I decided to stop drinking. 

After a good night’s sleep, an early morning workout, and some reflection this morning, I have some pieces to pick up. I’m hoping if I write this enough times I’ll finally realize throwing a massive tantrum when I have big feelings is not a healthy behavior for someone my age. I’ll figure it out one day.

I knew there would be lots of wine and this friend and I have downed many a bottle together. But I felt strong and I wanted some Bouillabaisse the place is supposed to be famous for. I accepted, prettied myself, and headed out after some prayer and affirmations that I knew would bolster my sobriety. Plus, I felt hella strong and happy about Day 3. I stayed that way! However, when I sat down and ordered a large bottle of San Pelligrino, I saw the question on her face. I blurted out, ""I'm drying out from Costa Rica,"" and left it at that. Since I'm a bit of a people pleaser, I felt uncomfortable that she was uncomfortable since we'd also had conversations about getting sober in the past. To offset that, throughout the event, I urged her to drink on. ""Girl, go ahead, you know I'd be right there with you otherwise..."" I watched the changed that each glass of wine had on her (4 total) and after the last said I'd drive her home if she wanted to have another. While I smiled all the way home that I didn't cave (and wasn't driving under the influence), this morning I feel a little slimy about urging her to drink. But I guess the bottom line is, while I might have urged, it was her choice to imbibe. Just like it was my choice not to. And I have to be selfish and protective of that choice at all costs. My sobriety is #1. When I have a little more time under my belt, maybe I'll have an opportunity to nudge her in the opposite direction. But right now it's all about me. IWNDWYT",8

""There's something about you... keeping me sober.""

This song and music video inspires me. Men deal with a lot of pain alone. They are less likely to seek the type of support structure women get for fear of being called gay (nothing wrong with being gay btw). We (men) do not want to lose social status, so we jam down our emotions and die inside. Women also tend to jam down their anger emotion as they are conitioned to be nurturers. There also is the nature aspect of it.

Honestly, I do not give a fuck and have female and male friends. I talk about emotions. I work on healing. Are you human? Okay. Then go from there and there is no need to confirm to, frankly, unhealthy standards of being. It is okay to be positive. It is okay to be negative. It is okay to heal.

I also understand women, statistically, have higher incidents of depression. Men are more likely to have a ""successful"" attempt at suicide.

There is a lot more to talk about but I am going to leave it here for now! Have a good day!

These so-called milestone days are always a bit rough for me, so this'll be an accountability post as well.

I consider myself lucky, and sometimes I remember to be grateful too for my sober days and how my life has changed for the better since last summer. I am in all the ways healthier, and my existence is not just surviving day after day anymore. I'm in a relationship too.

That being said, I've realized through therapy that I'm very much an emotional adolescent, I am still depressed and anxious and I really am questioning whether having an SO right now is wise. She has her issues too, and although not alcohol related, I find myself unable to often be supportive towards her struggles. I'm having a rough time right now as well, and even though I haven't really had cravings in months now I've definitely had a fair amount of triggers. 

I remember someone saying that sobriety is a lonely road on this subreddit, and I'd add to that that it is a very selfish journey too, or at least for me. At the same time I feel guilty and yet determined to put myself and my well-being first and foremost. It is conflicting. Embarrassing. Alienating. I find myself seeking the same dopamine rushes from the relationship as I did from alcohol, at least to some degree. I don't think that is fair. But at the same time I crave and need connection, as addiction is at the root disconnection from yourself and others. Perhaps disconnection from meaning too. 

All this being said, I'm glad I feel things again. Even though it is scary and terrifying at points. Especially the good things.

For all of you reading this, thinking: 'how could I possibly make it to a year?' 

Can you imagine that I thought exactly the same?

... of course I thought about hitting the one year mark often. Sometimes it felt like all I could think about. In my mind, by that time it would be a serious attempt, maybe even a succeeded one. 

I projected success on a future state, although day to day me was already making progress.

Already at one month, two months, three months, or four months and a week, I was succeeding day after day after day. 

Every IWNDWYT was an important step. 

I quit drinking on a Sunday morning, when I woke up with another terribble hangover, feeling not only unsatisfied with again a day lost, but more generally I thought: this is not the way I want to treat my body/mind and spend my time.

It was not just an impulse. I had been trying to quit drinking on and off already, so I kind of really wanted it, but also experienced some pushbacks. And here we are. 1 year sober. 

The book The Naked Mind helped me tremendously, just as did reading and writing on this subreddit. I think the two of them make for great support. Love for you.",27

That makes 18 years of drinking. I’m surrounded by people who drink daily and then are drunk every weekend.

It’s more like “ok well this is what we do so I guess I’ll get to it”. I’m over it. 

Drinking has done nothing positive for me. It’s given me hangovers and panic attacks and weight gain and embarrassment and I’m sure other negative effects that I just don’t want to think about right now. 

I want to be one of those people who can have a glass of wine or one cocktail in a social setting and be good to go. But I’m not. I can’t stop at one unless I know I’m the DD. 

It’s incredibly frustrating that so much of my social life is consumed by drinking. Its incredibly frustrating that I don’t just say “no thanks, I’m good” and still have a great time with everyone.

2020-02-18 02:07:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f5nvev/50_days_sober/,50 Days Sober,"Almost 37 yo, it's strange to think that I've never been sober this long as an adult and I think even before then. I wanted this to happen for such a long time and now it's really happening?!

I used to be in a cycle that started with a lot of caffeine in the morning, alcohol in the afternoon or evening after I had done my day's work (or while still doing work - why not? I thought), then often nicotine, valium and more. But I quit all of that at once after a rock bottom experience just before new year and feel much better. Key to quitting it all was quitting alcohol, my drug that the others revolved around. People never talk about alcohol as a gateway drug, maybe they don't even think about it as a drug. When I was an inpatient they called it ""D&A"" as though drugs and alcohol are loosely related but separate categories. Not saying everyone who uses alcohol uses other drugs too, but I'm sure a lot of complicated addiction patterns start with alcohol.

Not long after quitting I started to feel like I rediscovered my inner child, I always thought that kind of talk was crap until now. I know people on here sometimes talk about their inner child as the compulsive and irresponsible force that compels them to drink. For me, drinking was a specifically adult behaviour, something that adults do to handle stress. My childhood wasn't awesome but over previous years of increasingly intense binge drinking I felt like I had lost the peacefulness of the best times of childhood, when I was just existing, fully engaged and absorbed in whatever activities I was doing, falling asleep when I was tired and waking up early because I was rested. In adult mode I was always charging through the next set of overwhelming tasks or chores to get to the alcohol waiting for me at the end. My way of existing now is more like the inner child way... peacefulness... drifting with memories and dreams... I want to say it's OK little guy you can come out now.

I'm surprised how rapidly things have been changing for me. The most obvious thing to change was sleep, I fall asleep easily and sleep deeply and soundly all night. On alcohol (and caffeine) I was constantly sleep deprived. But the biggest change is my control over my own thoughts and emotions. I experience a lot more power of decision over what my mind is doing. On alcohol I was always grieving, ruminating, raging. Sober it's like opening a window and those things just fly out - bye! - as though replaced with fresh air. It is also the humility of having confronted substance abuse... I'm still getting used to the idea that I can just let things go. All sorts of things are changing for me, big things... a new job that I could never have held while actively behaving alcoholic... the loss of a major unconstructive relationship... the reconstruction and redefining of other relationships... standing up for myself... having money in the bank that didn't get spent on alcohol... smashing through chores and to-do lists, being more productive than ever resolving problems and getting things done... creativity impulses I thought were dead forever...

Quitting alcohol has been so life changing for me so far that I am curious to see how things will continue changing. It's cheesy but it feels like one of those cartoons where there's a fork in the road and one of them leads to doom and gloom... I feel like I went in the other direction from that and everything is looking better for me. The future is always scary but I feel more and more now that I can handle it.

BF is all about going on a diet since now embarking on the sober life, so when he got home from work, we went to the grocery store. 

We bought:

- 10 Smart Ones frozen means (on sale for 5/$9 or 10/$18)
- Two types of hummus (2 for $3)
- String Cheese ($3)
- Baby Carrots ($2)
- yogurt cups (on sale 10/$6)

The bill came out to $36. It was shocking to actually have groceries in the cart for the same about of two twelve packs. This stuff actually serves a purpose!

They really shouldn't have the hold on me they do to make me feel like a shitty terrible person. Theyd read that sentence and feel like its manipulative, thats been a word tossed around me lately. 

I dont say it to make them feel bad, in fact I know them well enough they wouldn't feel bad. Cause thats unhealthy.

But its true, when theyre mad at me I just feel like complete utter worthless garbage. Its me giving them power over me because I hate myself so ill over invest my energy in them... and then I get hurt because my love isn't getting returned to me but obviously it cant because they're healthy normal people who value themselves.

I feel like that sounds matryish but I dont mean it like that. Its a flaw. I should be like them more, I just have this giant black hole 🕳 inside of me.

anyway Ive been doing really well but I wanted this to finally be the excuse to break me. finally bought those 4loko seltzers. waited the full day before finally cracking one open and having a few sips. Short version is a relative caught me, i initially lied before doing the right thing and dumping it. (Im not resetting my timer... it was a few sips and I never even got a buzz.)

Its not my friends fault. Its been really hard lately... but one of the things motivating me to be better was not ruining my friendships and you know that horrible nasty voice thats like ""what was the point of all your effort? Sober or not you still ruined everything you piece of shit!""

and im so god damn beaten from work. I cant take it anymore. I really do just wanna give up, be unemployed and drink myself into oblivion. even now things are sorta okay with my friends, I still feel like garbage.",2

It was so bad, on Sunday my BFF brought up that I should consider outpatient mental health services. I used to drink to numb all the fear, sadness, guilt, shame, and negative thoughts. Without that, what else was a supposed to do? My solution was to lay in bed all day and watch netflix. 

So today was spent with no Netflix and no bed, writing out everything I was actually feeling. And then the tears finally came. And, oh boy, they have barely stopped since. 

But it felt good to feel something again for once. So that’s what I just kept telling myself the whole day -  “feel the feelings again” even the bad ones.

I work at a comedy club in NYC, so the people I work with drink pretty heavily and pretty regularly, and I knew that going in so I expected the party to involve a lot of that. But I really didn't expect the extent of it all. Huge open bar, an ice luge for shots, loud music, gambling, people smoking weed out in the open, so on and so on; the party was nuts. And I stood there with my club soda awkwardly sharing a few words with random people and just feeling shitty and uncomfortable the whole time. I kind of don't know how to put into words how I was feeling. It was kind of a whole mix of wishing I was still drinking just because I knew that would make the party easier for me, while also wondering if I really want to be included and accepted by this group of people, and if it was worth being drunk and sloppy. I think ultimately I know at least now that I cannot fully enjoy parties sober, but I also don't know if I even want to enjoy them anymore. For the record, I never came close to getting a drink and knew that I wouldn't, but it just left me feeling so empty and sad. This is a ramble, like I said I really don't know how to put it, but it's been the hardest night of not drinking for me so far (almost a month and a half in). And not necessarily not drinking, but sort of mourning how I used to enjoy parties, because I feel like that's gone now, and I feel like I'm saying bye to a part of myself, even if it's for the best. Not sure how to feel. But right now, just sadness and frustration.

But I’ve found a great podcast too called “Take A Break From Drinking,” with Rachel Hart. It’s free, so that’s badass, but it also has a lot of good stuff on anxiety and numbing. Raise your hand if those two things got you here, at least in part.

Rachel does have a disclaimer that her podcast is not for alcoholics, whatever that means. But for those of you not obsessed with labels or are still wanting to dig deeper into the “why” we got out of hand with alcohol, it’s an interesting podcast to listen to. 

While we are discussing it, I’d like to also hear from any “true blue alcoholics” as they say in AA, who drank like we drank, but for no apparent reason at all - weren’t trying to cope, mask a feeling, heal from pain, calm your mind, face a crowd, etc. Does that person actually exist? I am really and truly fascinated by the idea that one would chronically drink in excess for no apparent reason after college. 

Please do not take offense to any of this. This is ideally going to be a civil discussion. We are all here to learn, right?

It’s so apparent now how alcoholism grows due to a feedback loop because once you’re more easily agitated or anxious it gives further subconscious reasons to drink in order to numb oneself even more. Like a bug or “feature” of human programming that cannot be patched short of actually abstaining.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Well it is Terrific Tuesday SD! ! For those who stayed sober for the last 24 hours, High 5's!! For those who slipped, remember it is not how many times you get knocked down that counts, but how many times you get up! Let's all not drink together today!

Then I thought how her relationship mirrored what my relationship was with alcohol. I am an intelligent, good person. Alcohol was not good for me. Alcohol damaged me. I stayed in my relationship with alcohol for too long. Alcohol was my toxic relationship! Difference between her and I is, I kicked that sucker to the curb!!!!

March of last year I logged a DUI. In April I received my sentence, and that begun my sobriety. 


I made it 127 days. One-hundred, twenty seven, amazing days. 


Then one day, I said I could go back to the bottle and it would be fine. I had demonstrated a level of control. I could do this. 


I was wrong. 


Nothing crazy happened. But before I could realize it I was right back where I started, drinking the way I used to. My anxiety is palpable. My body aches. Called out of work a few times. But nothing crazy has happened. I just had a realization while I was walking to the bus stop. 


I don’t like myself like this. I don’t like myself any more as a drinker than as a sober person. In fact I’d say I like myself markedly less as a drinker. I’m sure as shit poorer. 


So I broke my after-work cycle. And as luck would have it my ex girlfriend (who herself has gone sober) hit me up to see if I wanted to have dinner. I agreed, went home, cleaned up the house a bit, got in the shower, already miles ahead of where I normally would be on a Monday after a rough day at work. 


She never came over. Maybe it was too much for her to see me again after all or whatever, but she sent me a couple text messages apologizing profusely and she had to cancel. 


I stared at the whisky bottle on my kitchen counter. It’s a little under half way full. I haven’t poured it out yet, but I want nothing to do with it. It resides under my kitchen sink. Because with or without her around and just because one bad thing happened, I will not let that stop a decision I made to be better. 


I got to cooking and made dinner anyway, threw my clothes in the laundry. Called my mom and talked about all this, it’s been too long since we last spoke. Got my gym clothes ready for tomorrow, and leftovers loaded up for work. I just got a promotion and read over some paperwork on my laptop. 


This is the version of me I like. This is who I still am underneath a veneer shines with whisky. And I won’t cancel on myself. I am capable of so much, even as a drinker, I will be unstoppable again as a sober man. 


I will break the cycle. I did it once. I will do it again.",41
2020-02-17 22:42:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f5lg3h/my_first_29_days/,My first 29 days,"I decided to get a jump on my New Years resolution, so in early December I started to stop drinking. By mid January, after a lot of journaling and crying and looking at myself in the mirror and begging myself to stop, I finally made it through my first weekend. I was still sick on the Tuesday before that weekend, but on the Wednesday I was feeling better and was getting worried, if I wasn’t sick, I was probably going to drink soon. I kept saying one day at a time but in my mind it was all about getting ready for Friday night and Saturday afternoon and Saturday night. My friend was in town hanging with another friend and the plan was to get wasted. I told them 100% I wasn’t drinking and I wasn’t going to hang out. 

I talked to myself all the time, telling myself to resist, that I was going to stroke out like my father, or drink myself to death like my grandmother, who laid in bed drinking until she died. I told myself that not drinking was the greatest challenge of my life, that it was an adventure, to drink again was to never go another adventure again. I just kept repeating whatever seemed like it might resonate. I would say it out loud to myself, sometimes looking in the mirror when I did. Which made me cry and feel so full of shame and weakness. I’d use one platitude for a couple of days and then lean into another one when it started losing its power. I put post it notes up all over my house, some encouraging, some brutal and mean. I would read them when I walked passed. I would touch them and focus on them. I took long showers and just kept saying to myself, ‘don’t drink today and get ready for the weekend. You aren’t going to drink on the weekend.’ I’m a binge drinker. I can go a couple days, drink only a bottle of wine on Wednesday or Thursday, but come the weekend, I drank for real.

Friday night came and I felt strong and for some insane reason, I went to my friend’s house. And I didn’t drink. I joked around with them the same way I did when I was drunk. They pressured me a bit but I laughed it off and just kept drinking water. Then when their initial positive rush was over, and they started to slur their speech and that slow heavy drag started to take over the kitchen. I just grabbed my coat and before they could protest I left and walked the long walk home through the cold night. I was so happy. I knew then I had a chance. I had fun that night, real fun, and I didn’t drink.

The next week was not magically easy. I normally drank alone and every single day I wanted to drink There was a bit of pink cloud but really I was distraught. I started over eating and smoking a lot of weed. But I also kept talking to myself, ‘anything but drinking. You’ve lost 20 years. Don’t drink today. Resist. Resist. Resist.’ I’d read AA materials, listen to stop drinking audio books. Watch celebrities talk about giving up drugs and alcohol. Just trying to saturate myself, and anything that worked I grabbed on to.

By the third week I was randomly crying a lot. I went to an AA meeting and when I tried to share I could barely talk. I just wanted to run out of the room and cry in the hall. I kept picking at my cuticles. Afterwards people were nice to me but I was so disoriented. I left and I called my mother and told her I went to AA. She knew that I struggled, as I had been arrested and had medical problems from drinking, but we never really talked about it. I just never drank around her. But I told her, I told her it had been three weeks since I had a drink, and she cried and told me she was so proud of me. The way she said it, it was so full of love and fear. 

This passed week was a lot easier. I’m still over eating and still smoke weed. But that is something I’m getting ready to deal with as well. This is new territory for me. One month is very foreign, I can’t remember the last time I made it to a month, probably after I got arrested and court mandated counselling 8 years ago. But I’m not resting or letting my guard down. I don’t know what the plan is but I am going to keep looking for what works for me and no matter what, I’m not putting ethanol in my body. 

One day at a time. Stay strong brothers and sisters, we can do this. We are doing this.",10

I can't imagine putting myself through all the health problems I was having from alcohol. I am so very thankful to myself for getting sober.

I’ll be honest - I’m still trying to figure out what I even want. I’ve definitely abused alcohol due to trauma, but I have regained a lot of control. It’s just weird to picture certain scenarios without IT, but I’m definitely seeing the grass really is greener and I can do anything. 

But! Needing to write here because I don’t have anyone to bond with on this/ramble to. I’m going to try not to be angry with myself and appreciate what I learned, read some quitlit and really solidify my mentality for who I want to be and not poisoning myself.

I don't really know which aspect to chalk it up to -- my body really hasn't changed *that* much in this amount of time (although weight-loss is starting to happen). I think it's a mentality that I had lost long ago. I used to be SO confident in myself and love myself, happy whatever. I was drinking, but I was carefree, student, didn't really have issues. The more recent years of career-finding, moving, paying back student loans, responsibilities made life seem less .. fun. 

Drinking and drug use were catalysts for negative change. They put me into an amplified negative hate spiral. I just had no motivation. I reluctantly went to the gym like... once a week. If that. I ate like shit. I drank and would make bad decisions. Every time, adding to the hate spiral.

Then I stopped drinking, mostly was just going to do it for dry January, but then I just started feeling so much better. I stopped hating myself, and while correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, I think stopping was the catalyst for positive change. I eat better, I love running again, I love waking up early. Yeah, I still have to pay back loans, and im not the happiest with where I live, but its so much more manageable.

For some reason, I found myself thinking about times when I've been so drunk I embarrassed myself because I got too emotional or aggressive or just behaved in a way that I feel was not myself... between the years 2005-2010. Somehow I was making a list of embarrassing moments from my early 20s, recalling moments I thought I had forgotten and wonder why a certain pattern exists and what underlying feelings might have helped this sort of behaviour. These are, for the most part, not even my worst moments, but for some minutes I was fixated on them, which made me feel quite anxious to the point that I went down the ""I wasted my youth"" line, which I know is a lie. Thankfully I could talk myself out of this easily enough, but it's left me feeling slightly uneasy because it's never happened before with such distant memories. Whenever I feel embarrassment at my drunk behaviour, I am usually thinking about almost every time I got drunk in 2019 when each bender was a slight regret and I was more aware of the effect alcohol had on my behaviour and my mental health, I had never gone that far back.

About 12 of us (late 20s/early 30s) book a long weekend trip each year - this year it was skiing (something I also tend to dread on its own). 

This is THAT group of friends, the ones where I can drink to my full alcoholic content to without judgement (other than my husband) because they too love to drink. I was pretty uneasy going into it because I hadn’t “outed myself” to them. I wasn’t nervous about drinking, but felt genuinely weird about telling them I stopped. 

Welp, they found out and I got an array of responses, from impressed to them thinking I had been abducted by aliens. The topic stayed weird for me, but I got through it & the whole thing really helped with perspective. 

There were absolutely times this weekend I felt jealous that I wasn’t drinking. However, there was not one time this weekend that I felt concerned that we were going to run out of liquor. I didn’t have to plan drinking around events, or sneak drinks while at them. Never felt annoyed because I could feel my buzz dying, obsessed with trying to find more. No mystery mornings trying to decide if I was fun last night or if I owed everyone an apology. And of course, the perk that never gets old, NOT A SINGLE HANGOVER!

Success!,"I stopped drinking a little under a month ago. I was a daily, heavy drinker and the thought of 24 hours without booze or drugs scared me to death. Long story short, I had to choose either drinking and probably dying/losing all meaningful relationships, and getting sober and enjoying a life of sobriety. 

I went to my girlfriend's college house two nights ago, knowing that they were going to be throwing a party and so I was planning on leaving as it got started. I ended up staying and partying sober with them!

Her roommates were incredibly rude, and before the party even started they messaged her saying they didn't want me to stay and that I shouldn't be around alcohol this soon. My girlfriend and I ignored them, even when they were rubbing it in as the night went along (being wayyy overly obnoxious to me about the fact they were drinking, yelling ""Shots! Shots! Shots!"", Etc.). We continued to ignore them and I sipped on some iced tea and socialized, having a good time. I was even completely fine when my girlfriend had two glasses of wine in front of me!

Later in the night, I took inventory of the house full of drunk people. One guy got so drunk within the first hour that he was having trouble standing up, being loud and incoherent, and ended up having some people cut him off and his girlfriend yelling at him. Another guy was making a complete fool of himself by trying to give me and my girlfriends beloved golden retriever large amounts of alcohol, which I put a stop to. I was so happy to be clear headed, sociable, able to speak coherently, and knowing I'd wake up in the morning feeling great and ready for a workout and productive day! It honestly was such an important night for me in terms of recovery, and seeing so many people acting like high schoolers at their first party made me not want to drink even more. 

I would never act like a saint or talk down to people for getting too drunk, because I guarantee I have been worse than everyone at that party many a night, but I couldn't be happier and more proud of myself for sticking to sobriety. One month ago I would have been the most intoxicated person there, but here I am not even having the urge to drink. Cheers!

When she left I could feel the urge, and regretfully I emotionally gave in. I've gone 6 days, clearly, I can control this. I walked over to gather my shoes to walk to CVS to grab whatever my heart desired. As I bent over I saw the new running shoes I bought with the intention of changing my ways. For too long I stared at the two of them deciding which ones to lace up. Because of this community I recently read ""Alchohol Explained"" and knew the tricks my mind was trying to play on me. So rather than grabbing my 'drinking shoes' I tightened up my running shoes, went no headphones (helps me actively meditate) and hit the pavement. 3.5 miles later and I feel great!

Too much of my life has been predicated by ""if-then"" statements. ""If only I had better running shoes then I'd run more"" ""If only my job wasn't so stressful then I wouldn't need to reward myself with a drink"". You get the idea....

I  am not sure if I will never drink again, but I know I won't today. I'm proud that when the fork in the road presented itself I chose the healthier route. My new mindset is ""battles and the war"" I am in a war against alcoholism, in order to defeat it, there will be many battles along the way. Today I won that battle, tomorrow is a new day.",130

2020-02-17 15:28:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f5f1x1/sober_life_is_kind_of_surreal/,Sober life is kind of surreal," A little over 10 months here. I haven't posted much lately but I'm sitting here in this endless car wash lane. I was mindful enough to bring Paul Churchill's new recovery book here but found myself here. So here goes -

It's just surreal. Its hard to quantify because I just feel a complete change from who I was and who I'm on my way to being every day.

This morning I was counting coins and cash I've been putting in a bucket from a second job, neatly placing them in a Ziploc for a vacation I want. 10 months ago I was literally scraping that bucket to buy anything that would quickly satisfy my needs, whether it being alcohol drugs, hangover food or poor tasting coffee.

I work as a bar manager of sorts at a hockey arena and had a moment last night. I'm squatting down in a sea of beer drinkers with the bartender pouring draughts over my head as I'm changing out a second keg. I just laughed. It's the closest alcohol has been to my mouth in so long. It was just a spur of happiness, feeling like I'm finally able to control these urges and desires that I always felt powerless over.

I'm finding joy in all of these little things every single day now and am just amazed with life. I don't really know where I'm going with any of this here, and I know that I'll have to watch out for triggers and set backs and stressors and events that may lead me to considering going down a path that I don't need to. But man..

Today is that day I promised myself ten months ago. Crying all alone in a car wash lane. Because I'm happy this time. And I'm proud of myself.

Thank you to everyone here. For listening, for being brave enough to tell your stories, for your guidance and for your ability to relate. Life does get better.

All the best,
J

Edit: This post kind of blew up, so I was just to thank all of you from the bottom of my heart. It means so much.

I'm not sure I would have lasted this long without you guys THANK YOU,"I recently moved in another country for a student exchange program. I decided to buckle up and travel in Europe a bit before my classes begin.  
Yesterday night, I ended up in a rooftop bar with a new friend I made in my hostel dormitory, talked about everything until 2m, had a night kebab, ended up having incredible and crazy sex with some russian dude I met a few days ago...all of that sober. 

I thought sobriety would make me boring. That I would never enjoy night life again, have fun, be spontaneous, or have all of those moments again.   
I was so nervous to pass that 1 year mark.  
But I've never been healthier, happier, met so many people. I've learned to face social anxiety, all my trauma, my ugly shit and to deal with it. And thanks to that painful beautiful process, I've learned to relax, to talk to people again, to flirt and date again, to build relationships.

Not every day is easy but sobriety is the best choice I ever made. I'm so so so grateful for this community, for your kind words, for your support. And every new post I see here about someone having their first week-end, their first week sober, their first month makes me so happy. It's so heartwarming to see you begin that journey with us.

I told her yesterday afternoon that I am on an alcohol break, so I won't be drinking with her, but she is still welcome to bring whatever she wants.  She shows up with a bottle of Gin (one of my former favorites).

We hung out for about 3 hours, had dinner (I made a korean black-bean stew yesterday), and watched some stupid tv show.

After the first 5 minutes, I wasn't even tempted to have some Gin with her.  I was happy to just sit and talk and drink my soda water.  The best part about it, was that when she went to leave I MADE SURE that she took the rest of the Gin with her.  I know that if it stayed in my house last night, I would've finished the bottle.

In the three hours we were hanging out, she finished half the 750 ml bottle.  This is how I used to drink with her, one fifth was barely enough for both of us.  It was great to see that sober, because it just reinforces the feeling that I started doing this because I wanted to be healther, but now I WANT to continue this journey because my life has improved drastically in the past 3 weeks.

My relationship with my SO is better than ever, I am losing weight, and I am getting on top of things that I have let slip for way too long!

2020-02-17 12:49:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f5ci8q/something_i_have_noticed/,Something I Have Noticed,"Something I’ve noticed over the past several months is that, on days that I would typically drink, I start to create a narrative early in the day that can only lead to getting drunk. Typical, everyday stresses at work or at home get blown up into “OMG this day is so stressful, I had to perform the normal tasks of my job! OMG I need a drink!” or “OMG, I paid to have the car detailed and my wife doesn’t like the job the guy did, marriage sucks, get me a drink, stat!” I’ve been at my job for five years and I can probably count on one hand the number of legit shitty days. I’ve also been married for five years and though the shitty days probably outnumber the fingers on one hand, compared to a lot of couples, we are the picture of peace. 

I am a people pleaser and non-confrontational to a fault, which means that any criticism towards me, or the appearance that someone might be upset with something I’ve said or done can result in an anxiety spike, which can also lead to drinking at the end of the day, even though criticism is a normal part of life and is usually not the end of the world. See, I understand reality and I understand how my mind works. But when it comes to using that information to create a better version of myself instead of falling into the same traps week after week. I guess I’m just fucking lazy. That’s too much work! It’s too much work to say NO. It’s too awkward to plan on making dinner after work because if I don’t and the wife doesn’t, we will default to drinking. It’s easier to just slide on into the bad habits that we’ve known for so long. We can be better tomorrow. 

This morning, I tried to front load the day with good choices that would set me up to NDWYT. Up at 530, I took a walk around the block, then meditated for 10 mins, which I have not done (either) for a while. Ate breakfast, took some supplements. Got to work early and proceeded to own the morning. But regardless of the exterior things I do, my mind wants to fight with me, to tell me that I’m not normal, that my life is crap, that I need to drink to feel better about…what? My life is not so terrible. So I will fight.",39

I've been reading posts about this, the exhaustion, the emotional roller coaster. That helps, but really I am just all over the place. I can’t find my ground. The details of life feel unmanageable.

Within a few years I’d started drinking on a near weekly basis with friends, and when a close friend killed themself shortly after high school I found myself a full blown alcoholic.

The silver lining here is the fact that it was only one night and I didn't continue drinking the next day. Usually when I start drinking I find it so hard to stop. I've been sober for Friday, Saturday, Sunday and now I'm on day 4. (will update the badge when I get around to it.) I've always had this stupid ""all or nothing"" mindset. When I screw up I think ""well I've already screwed up so it doesn't matter anymore, I might just as well keep drinking.""

After my slip up 10 days ago, we were doing good financially.  Got groceries, started the 2020 budget in earnest, etc..  Was doing it! Hit another week sober!  But then got a lawsuit taped to my door.

tl;dr - my soon to be ex got in a drunk driving accident, in my car. I was never informed it was an accident, just another arrest, go here to get your car out of impound. I didn't file insurance on it, because it was cosmetic only damage, and it looked to be previous damage from her going into a ditch. Officer never gave me other drivers information or a report number.  Other party recently added me as a co-defendant, claiming I ""allowed"" stbxw to drive / gave her permission by having the car available.

So I called my insurance, got a claim going, had to get reports and file responses, $250 later I feel not only exhausted but like utter and complete shite.  For what the other party is requesting, if my insurance for some reason doesn't cover, I'm... i'm not going to have a lot of options. Trying not to think of it.

That was last week Thursday.  a day where it had been pouring all day. Flooding was coming (and, now, is here).  I still had a few hundred in  my account, and was well stocked for the week.  Went down to the car with the full purpose of grabbing some libations for the weekend.  Put the key in the car... turned... ""click click click click click"".  The car that had not a week earlier taken us to Florida and Back, my pride and joy, had a dead battery.  FFFFFFUUUUUUUUU world.

Okay.  Get a jump from roadside assistance, putter over to Zone of the Auto's.  Pouring rain outside at this point.  This poor guy who works there... together we take out the old battery. Put in the new one. $160 drained, plus i gave him a 20 for tip.  Didn't bother checking the account, knew I had enough... Puttered over to my favorite libations store... Guy has my favorite gin queued up, was surprised he hadn't seen me earlier... check out... /declined.

I pull out my phone.  Apparently, when I did the budget, i had forgotten that everything digital came out that day, as did my fitness club (hah) fees. My remaining money had been decimated.   A higher power's way of laughing at me (even though I know it's my fault).

Used as much of the remaining as possible to buy fun and cheap meals for me and the kiddo the rest of the weekend and this week, and then made sure his school lunch account had enough.

That left me with $8 in my account.  

The weekend was harsh. Not because I was truly still detoxing, but because... I felt like utter poo. I can't un-see the darkness of the possibility that things go south. And the urges... I seriously thought about trying to use bread yeast and potatoes to try to get something started lol.  

But my ever thoughtful kiddo kept me in good spirits.  From board games to movies to diablo 3 on the ps4, we had a blast over the weekend. Now ready to face this week, and whatever challenges it may bring.

1. Stop partying and stop drinking to hide all the internal conflicts and issues he had

2. Thought professional help for his internal demons and struggles 

And the not drinking part is the biggest first step. Now I wish all the best for Dennis and I did some googling this morning on him as I thought about his story. Just a few months ago he had an incident at a bar. Which tells me he still struggles with drinking. 

Also his networth is estimated at 500k and the omly way he appears to make a living is paid appearances and selling merchandise on his site (which i checked out and its expensive)

And Im so grateful I dont have deal with the internal personal struggles he does.

Things that would have lead to downward spirals are controllable, I can feel feelings, and life is improving everyday. I went from losing everything to being in the best position I have been in my life. I lost my house, my job, my wife, my daughter, my freedom, had no money, and self respect.  I have my house back, my job, bad ass girlfriend, on speaking terms with the ex, daughter is talking to me again, money in savings, I'm happy and most importantly I have my health and a plan for the future.

I still think about alcohol from time to time but then I remember the smell and the feelings that go with them.

Though I never pegged myself an alcoholic, there have been far too many nights where I've done things I regretted, drank to the point of vomiting, mornings wrought with nausea and anxiety, and engaging in risky behaviors that are damaging or hurtful to both myself and others.  

Despite all of this, I was extremely functional and had a more or less ""normal"" social life.  Something that really resonated with me was seeing someone's comment that you don't necessarily need to hit rock bottom to decide to give it up.

Though I was never the morning drinker, sneaking it at work or in the daytime, or reaching the cliched depths of addiction so many less fortunate people have experienced, it's hard to deny it was a net negative and impacting my life for the worse.  Each day of sobriety I tack on, it feels like there is more at stake and more incentive to keep the streak alive.

The idea of having one or two drinks and then stopping because you don't like the feeling of inebriation is so anathema to everything I know about alcohol.

It feels special, even though I've was previously close to 1.5 years before a post-breakup relapse took it away. Perhaps its because I essentially did this alone, but for my cat, and I was in the same circumstances that led to my increased drinking. Stress (work instead of grad school), living alone and isolated, feeling lost.

It's strange, the days leading up to this. It feels like everything has changed and at the same time, very little. I'm still depressed and anxious, I still gained the Christmas weight (although not as drastic), and the student loans are still there. But, I understand, despite the issues still being there, my sobriety has allowed me to tackle them from a position of strength. It has been a tool to allow me to better shoulder life burdens and overcome them. At least, to the best of my abilities.

I know my cat is happier that I'm sober. I'm able to dedicate more time to him, although being woken up at 4 am for playtime is never fun.

I still have the urge. In the early days, the urge was almost insurmountable. Now, it's just sorta there. Like a grey cloud, perhaps. Looming, but without great affect. But the the good days, the good days make it worth it. Early morning coffee, nights without having to take a pill to fall asleep, cuddles with the cat.

So it has been one year. I want to beat my previous sobriety record.  I'm competitive like that.

I need help :(

I have drink since 16 years old, I'm 30 now.

I only drink beer and usually only in the weekends, but in the last times that I drunk I vomited and yesterday for the first time I vomited blood and I can't see anymore the face of my wife scared, and I think that I will lose her if I don't stop this.

I tried to keep clean before but after one week or two I back to drink again, my entire family and friends drink and because this is hard to keep away from beer. They have control of it but I don't, when I start do drink it is hard to stop, I drink until I drop.

I always told to anyone that I'm not alcoholic that I can stop whenever I want but that is a lie I can't stop.

How can I stop for good? I need to stop now.",2

I'd wake up feeling guilty and scared until I realised it was a dream. _Why_ did I do this to myself again? _How_ could I let myself do the very thing I was so scared of? It's insane. It truly is insanity. 


I have so much to be thankful for. It could be so much worse. I have some great opportunities now thanks to all the work I did when I was sober, and I know if I keep drinking I'll throw it all away. I black out frequently and god knows I could get myself killed. My last drink was Saturday and I injured myself pretty badly. Don't remember it.


I think I'll be hanging around here a lot and hopefully posting regularly. I have a lot to figure out with myself. Right now I'm very tired but thankful to be sober and to be mostly okay. There's so much I want to do, and I can't do it while I'm drinking. I'm useless when I'm drinking. 


I have a lot of issues with my relationship to myself that I know I need to fix. If I constantly tell myself that I'm a worthless piece of shit, I'll continue to act like a worthless piece if shit. I know I need to change my perspective. I need to feel like I deserve to be better.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday SD! If you made it through the weekend, Great Job!! If you didn't and are starting over just remember that you haven't failed until you quit trying!

While contemplating a topic for today, I thought of all the benefits being sober these last 11 months have brought me. There are plenty and I could ramble on about what each of you already know or have experienced yourself.

However if I had to choose just one word to describe what sobriety has  given me, that word would be Freedom! One definition of freedom is knowing what you want and getting rid of the obstacles in your way. ""The secret to happiness is freedom and secret to freedom is courage""! Carrie Jones

Thoughts?","For a long time, I have rejected the thought of taking Xanax for mental health, or any benzodiazepine, because it is described as ""alcohol in a pill,"" and I'm a recovering alcoholic. Those two things don't mix. I don't want to take a pill that will make me want to drink again.

A week ago, my daily meds switched from Lexapro to Wellbutrin XL, and since I have anxiety attacks, I was prescribed 6 pills of 0.25 mg of Xanax just in case, while the meds are adjusting. Well, I had an anxiety attack today, and then even thinking about taking the Xanax made it worse. I felt like if I took it, then I would be basically drinking and I CAN'T go back down that road.

Has anyone had experience with Xanax after being sober? Did it have any impact on your recovery?",7

I am at a loss with myself.

I(23F) come from a family of alcoholics. I have my own struggles with alcohol and it's starting to take a toll on me. I have to stop completely. I've tried to talk to my mom about this and told her that I don't want to be completely sober I just need to cut down. I told her that I have it under control. She said to try to only have a drink on the weekends which sounds easy, but it's just not. I don't know why it's so hard to just NOT drink. I drink excessively knowing I have problem and I can't keep doing this to my mind and body. I confide in my mom about a lot of things but this is a sensitive subject because her dad was an alcoholic, my dad is struggling, and I don't want her to worry about me. All of my close friends like to drink, and I can't admit my struggles with alcohol to my SO. I feel like I can't find the right person to talk to about this.

For me, there is no ""only drink on the weekends"". It has to be no drinking at all. I have finally come to accept that the drinking needs to end. I need to for myself, my mom, and all of my relationships. I don't know what I would do if I ruined any of my relationships because of my excessive drinking. I honestly don't know if I can do this. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. ",6

His wife (my sister in law) was talking to me about a party they went to last night where he got *obliterated* and had to be taken care of all night and how she barely slept as a result. I don’t judge, hell, that’s been me more often than not but it wasn’t me last night, tonight, or any night in the last 50 some odd days.  

Feels good man. I chatted, laughed, made conversation, and I didn’t feel the need to make sure I got that last glass of wine. I went to the bathroom and had a moment where I was like “damn AT you lookin good!” I look happy. Healthy. There.   

 We ran out the door after dessert because Penny the Hound *really* needs to be let out, shes been crated since 2 and it’s now 6, the poor thing. I didn’t mind leaving (well, I felt guilty af about it) because I didn’t feel like I was being interrupted from cultivating the perfect buzz.

It’s hard for both of us to stay committed to sobriety. We don’t know how to manage that we both have addictive personalities. Any advice? Has anyone been in a relationship where both people have a drinking problem? 

I think my wife and I are both looking to the other person to be the leader, but neither one of us are stepping up.

It’s been several years since I have been 7 days with out drinking. I’m so ashamed to even write that sentence. I have tried and tried. I’ve made so many promises. I have tried so hard to go 30 days. I feel like if I can go 30 days then I can reset myself and feel comfortable while sober. I’ve had that goal for over 3 years and I haven’t gone more than 5 days. I sweat a lot. I get incredible anxiety. I get moody. 

What makes it worse is that when I drink, I do not drink just 1 day and then take a 2 day break. After I drink the first night, I wake up and start drinking again and again without stop. I didn’t drink for 2 days and then I felt bad on Monday. Emotionally I didn’t like my job, my wife, my entire life. I had promised not to drink that entire week. It was fucking Monday afternoon and I gave up. I have drank everyday since. The entire week flew by. Each night I had passed out somewhere in the house. This type of thing is a regular behavior. To be honest I’m scared. I’m so scared of the damage I am doing to my family. I’m scared of my own physical wellness. I feel horrible. I feel ashamed. I build myself up and I become committed to changing. I make significant effort into changing. I fight urges. I fight all the symptoms of recovery.  But I don’t get very far. Somewhere along the line I convince myself that drinking a small amount is okay. Or that I deserve it. Or that I’m a better husband and father when I drink. Honestly Sometimes I don’t even know how it happens, but I end up drinking. And when I drink one day then a huge bender comes on. The past 5 years have been bender after bender with only a few days of sobriety in between.

I need help. My wife needs help. She is just as bad as me. Please if you have something that can help and can offer any guidance, then please do. It feels like we have tried everything. We have a struggling marriage. Very middle class family. I understand that we would both benefit from rehab. We would welcome it with open arms. We don’t know if it is even feasible with jobs, kids, responsibility as adults. We went to our physician asking for help and thinking we could take a medication where any alcohol would make us horribly sick. Unfortunately the medication conflicts with another medication that we both take. 

Bottom line is both my wife and I need to fix ourselves. We need this to happen. We need sobriety in all aspects of our lives. How? What happens when ....? What about weekends or ....? What about the anxiety and sweating and withdrawals? How? 

How have you been able to come this far? How can we do the same? How do you find excitement and joy in sobriety? How do you feel relax and enjoy down time?  How can I get 1 week? How can I get a month? The last time I did 5 days I celebrated by drinking. That lead to a long bender. How do you celebrate?",3

The idea first came to me when I turned up a study which showed that a mere 5 hours of meditation  over a two week period (10 * 30 minute mediation sessions) reduced cigarette consumption in smokers. Interestingly this reduction was subconscious. After following the same course I've found I have no or few cravings for alcohol anymore, and if I do drink one, I don't get cravings to keep drinking to blackout. 

I know exercise has worked for some, but unfortunately it wasn't a panacea for me. I run high volume training for marathons, yet at the end of the day this high volume hard training didn't put a dent in my cravings for alcohol. Nor did diet (which I eat mostly plant based). The only thing that helped was going to and training my mind directly, because it was my mind creating my cravings in the first place. 

Now I won't be able to train for a few weeks due to a sprained big toe, and that would normally send me insane and drinking alcohol to cope. But 30 minutes to an hour meditation a day has really been helping me cope. It's also way more challenging than physical exercise. I find it easier to run for three or four hours nonstop then to meditate for two hours! So brain training is an even greater challenge for my self discipline. The benefits are so worth it though.",251

I'm 38 years old. About a year ago I stumbled across this subreddit along with This Naked Mind and I slowly tapered off the nightly bottle(s) of wine I was drinking. I got to where I was moderating quite well, really. Only dinking on weekends, never more than 4 drinks, no day drinking. You get the picture. 

Then I got pregnant in August 2019. Yay! I've struggled with infertility for many years so this was such a blessing. Several weeks later I went for my first ultrasound appt only to discover it was an ectopic pregnancy and I had internal bleeding so severe that had I waited even one more day I likely would've been dead. Needless to say that pregnancy had to be terminated along with my ability to ever have children naturally. 

Fast forward to November 2019. I was drinking more than ever. Hell, I had an excuse, right? I was depressed,  I was hopeless, I was riddled with anxiety, my marriage was falling apart, and I had completely lost my will to live. In that same light I also knew that I couldn't keep this shit up. I had just escaped death weeks before (which i should be SO thankful for) only to sail away on my own little depression filled booze cruise? I don't think so!!

So on November 18th after another blackout night of drinking, I said enough is enough. I struggled through Thanksgiving, holiday parties, New Year's, happy hours, and a vacation to Mexico. I went to therapy and learned how to grieve properly. I even started talking to some of my close friends about my sobriety and had one of them jump on the wagon with me (so cool).

This past 90 days has been incredibly healing. Looking back at where I was to where I am now, there's no denying my life has changed for the better! My marriage is thriving, I'm hopeful, I'm happy, I'm strong, and I'm ready to start living my best life (with or without children). I'm the person the drunk me always dreamed of being, and I can't help to think it's only going to get better!

Then this morning happened... I got up extra early, did a 45 minute Peloton ride, lifted weights for another hour, feeling studly and sober.

I’m out running errands now and trying to catch up on shit I’ve been putting off for... like a year or more... and about then was when the flip switched in my brain to go get those tall boys cuz that’s totally cool to do at 11am on a Sunday morning while you’re driving around.  

And damnit I was driving straight to the liquor store.  I already rationalized how I had a week already and starting Monday I’d jump right back aboard that wagon and get straight again.  I swear I could already taste the beer!

Just as I’m getting ready to pull up to the liquor spot I see this cool little coffee shop with a bunch of people hanging out doing you know, normal healthy sober people shit and I made that turn instead.  Thank god for normies and overpriced coffee!!!!!!!

I just want to be able to not drink for the wrong reasons (anger, sadness, loneliness, wanting numbness) and to enjoy a quality adult beverage in the appropriate settings (cold beer at a bbq, wine with a nice dinner, etc). Is it true that I'm like all the stories, and a single sip will send me into a tail spin?

it isn't that my behavior was bad last night. I didn't drive home, I didn't act out or do anything irrational. what I did do is lose my cell phone (it was under my passenger seat) for three hours and have a complete meltdown because I couldn't find it, which culminated in my best friend and I having quite the excited back and forth in my driveway before the people picking him up got there (he drove me home). 

all I know is I don't want to do this to myself anymore but I feel like if I open one I may as well buy a case. I don't know what it takes to fix this. alcoholism contributed to my father dying and I have a grandpa I didn't meet before he died because alcohol killed him before I was born. I don't wanna drink anymore but it almost feels like I'm unable to stop. nobody ever believes me when I tell them I'm gonna quit drinking but I hope I can stop cold turkey, starting today.

Dumb shit I don't do well in my daily life causes me to have a total meltdown and it's so silly!

While the morning hangover anxieties are a thing of the past, I feel like I grapple with this constant stress that I'm not doing the perfect thing every moment, or doing things right. It gets extra stressful when my sobriety gets involved--I've gotten into some sports that help keep me sober, but I'm currently off one of them because I'm injured (seeing a doctor: not a thing drinking me would've done!) but now I have a ton of panic about ""well if I can't do X sport I'm gonna fuck up my sobriety,"" like if I can't do the cool things I've discovered in sobriety, or I don't do them well enough or enjoy them enough, I'm worried I'll just start drinking again, or that all I'm good for is drinking ('well you suck at running but you don't suck at drinking, might as well stick with what you're good at!'). There's a good chance I drank to avoid these thoughts, which is why I never noticed them before (definitely would've been several beers deep into that pie crust yesterday lol) but I don't actually know what to DO about them.

When I asked what he was talking about he told me to ""cut the shit"". He does not believe me. This is so heartbreaking. I know he has plenty reason not to believe me, but it hurts. A LOT of the reason I quit was because I wanted to save our relationship. 

I am trying hard to not let this hurt the pride I have for myself. But it's hard as shit. I want to be able to celebrate my progress with him. Now I know in the back of his head he will be thinking my progress is a lie and won't be as happy or proud of me. 

This really sucks. And want to bring it up to him again to try and get him to believe me. Idk what to do. 

I think he has been checking my car. Because he said it wasn't there before. Not gonna lie, my car is a mess. I have kids crap and shit all in my car. When I 1st quit I knew that I had at least 1 bottle under there. So I felt under the seat but didn't feel it. Since I had cleaned my car I thought I must have gotten rid of it.

“When you drink alcohol while taking naltrexone, you can feel drunk, but you won't feel the pleasure that usually comes with it. ""You're trying to make that relationship with alcohol have no rewards,"" Holt says.

The medication can help ward off cravings, too, he says. When you have alcohol use disorder, just thinking about alcohol triggers a pleasurable response in the brain. ""Naltrexone can help uncouple alcohol and pleasure.""


Research shows that naltrexone works best for people who have already stopped drinking for at least 4 days when they begin treatment. You take it daily as a pill or get a monthly injection at your health care professional's office. The medication can help you have fewer days when you drink heavily as well as drink less overall.”

I'm hoping to get pregnant after I hit a year sober and am charting my cycles in more detail now to make sure I'm healthy and fertile when the time comes. I ran a quick statistical analysis of the last 14 months and the months that I was sober show a statistically significant increase in luteal phase spotting (spotting right before my period). I know that binge drinking can cause estrogen increases, and I wonder if this is related. However, I would think it would sort out almost 4 cycles into full sobriety.

It hit on something I've sensed for a long time but haven't been able to explain, basically that I use alcohol to try and access some kind of magical consciousness. I've usually thought about it as accessing art, creativity, or beauty. But I think it's all part of the same thing. Not to say I was always doing this when I drink; sometimes it was to feel less awkward in social situations or to try and have fun or whatever. But I think I was often looking for something magical to happen. Obviously, drinking is not the key to transcendence, and I would get frustrated and tell myself I was lazy because I was trying to feel like an artist or something by drinking rather than actually making art. I know it seems silly to look for magic or art in drinking, but it somehow made sense to me.

I went from a very social drinker( getting very drunk 1-3 times a week) to drinking 1-2 drinks every few weeks. The last several weeks I hadn't had any at all and I was feeling amazing. My chronic stomach issues, headaches and general tiredness was gone. My exercise routine was better than ever and I was eating to nourish myself. Then on Valentines day I decided to have 2 glasses(goblets) of wine. The rest of this weekend has felt awful- i've eaten foods I wouldn't have, dragged through my yoga class and slept for many more hours than necessary. 

It was such a good reminder of how I used to feel all the time- bloated, tired, achy. There is no such thing as moderation in drinking for me.  I'm excited to be back on the path- hopefully this weekend sticks with me. It wasn't a terrible embarrassing blackout drunk- but it was enough to make me a significantly worse version of myself.

2020-02-16 08:53:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f4qx4z/no_longer_alone/,No longer alone,"I started this sobriety thing almost 3 weeks ago and I have made great strides in my physical and mental health. The best part so far is that my wife and brother have agreed to take the journey with me. My wife was never an alcoholic per se, but she definitely drank because I was always buying booze for her. Mostly, so she wouldn’t be angry at me for drinking. She also suffers from lupus and kidney failure. I was literally killing my wife by pushing liquor on her every night so that I could stay drunk. 

My brother is three years younger and has always been my right hand man. We used to pilfer booze from my Dad’s stash and replace it with water. As my addiction intensified through the years, his did right in tow. We used to sit in my car in our twenties and share a pint a couple nights a week and listen to music as we talked about women and fighting and whatever else testosterone-ridden young men would fantasize about. Before you know it, we were buying our own pints. A couple nights became every night. We moved apart and our brotherly ritual morphed into solitude. 

When I told my brother I made the choice to get sober, he told me that he had been thinking about doing the same for some time. A couple of years ago, he made the decision to finish his college degree and get his masters. Having a constant hangover and fuzzy brain was not helping his progress. He agreed to take the journey with me.

My mother died a few years back and she was repulsed by all of our drinking. She came from a troubled background where substance abuse was all too common. After she told us she had terminal cancer, I don’t think she ever saw me sober again. I am crushed to think that my Mom’s last days were watching us slowly kill ourselves and dissolve the relationships around us, because we could not cope with the situation.

The only way to fix this is to get sober. And my wife and brother are behind me. So to all of you who are out there struggling just like me, remember that you’re not just doing this for yourself. There are people in your life that depend on you. Not only that you save yourself from addiction, but they might need your influence and example to save themselves. Just like all of you have inspired me. :)",5

This sub has been so helpful in showing me there's so many people that have stopped and are happy about it. I went from daily drinking (several glasses of wine and/or bourbons) to having at least some af days,, down to 1/2 a glass of wine every couple of weeks or so while pregnant. Had the baby, and now.... i've had a glass of wine some weeks, but it's just not enjoyable. I'll think that I should have one, when I have the chance, but the last two weeks I've just skipped it. One doesn't really do anything for me (really I want four), I'm not drinking with anyone, and I don't know, it just doesn't hold much appeal.

I'm kind of happy about this, it's nice to know I'll be sober if the boy wakes up in the middle of the night to nurse, but somehow I'm also not ready to commit to never drinking again. Even though I think that's what I want. When I think about returning to regular drinking, it just seems empty, but also a little inevitable - like I should aim for a drink or two a week, to seem normal. But that thought just kind of depresses me too.

I have been drinking since I was 14-15 (now 38M) and two years ago I realized I needed to stop (I was drinking about 1/3-1/2 of the 1.75liter bottle of Ketel One). I tried to stop alone (huge mistake I know and have paid) and have ended up in the hospital at least 7 times, twice with Acute Pancreatitis, with every relapse getting shorter. Last year in July I had just gotten sober again and a month later my Grandma died, I made it through that sober and then next month my Tata died, relapse, for about a month, a blur, ER, Sober. Promised myself sober holidays, 1st ever, and did. Went back home earlier this month to help family pack up Grandma's house to be sold. Lots of memories. Got home and relapse for just under a week, realizing what a huge mistake I was making I tried to sober up and back to the ER. Sober again just under a week. I went to the ER follow up visit with my DR and he has prescribed me Acamprosate. 

My question is, anyone who has had any success with this, how was it? I got to pick up my Rx tomorrow and would just like something from real people. I tried looking for the sam in other places but a lot go it felt like Ads. I know I'm still feeling the anxiety of Here I Go Again on My Own (I know I'm not alone), so any advice would be helpful.

Go To The Limits of Your Longing:

God speaks to each of us as he makes us,
then walks with us silently out of the night.

These are the words we dimly hear:

You, sent out beyond your recall,
go to the limits of your longing.
Embody me.

Flare up like a flame
and make big shadows I can move in.

Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.
Just keep going. No feeling is final.
Don’t let yourself lose me.

Nearby is the country they call life.
You will know it by its seriousness.

Take my Hand.

I am 3 weeks sober now and am very proud about that.

I have been doing SMART online meetings and found them very good but it doesn't give the friendship a life meeting can give. In my country SMART doesn't exist. I am considering going to an AA meeting in 2 hours, but am afraid to go. The God-thing is withholding me also to be honest.

Part of me still thinks I can do this sober thing alone, but deep down I know I can use some support.

For context: this guy was the kid in my high school friend group that for some reason got picked on by all of us, some more than others. I was the nicest to him, but I didnt stand up for him. Anyways, at one party senior year, we were both pretty hammered, and I was standing on top of his car like a drunk idiot. He started yelling at me and next thing you know, all of our friends are egging us on to go 30, so we went 30. I went overboard and he ended up taking a bit of damage. This kid was the nicest out of all of us and put up with so much bullshit. 

One year ago (three years later), I pull up to a red light and look to my left and his car coincidentally is next to mine. We make eye contact at the light and roll down our windows. I say ""yo, you gotta chill with me and [randy] sometime"". He says ""idk man"" and that was that. 

Today, on my way back from a faith based professional development conference, I pull up to a stop light on my way home (after talking about God and living to serve others all day), and sure enough, the same kids car is to my left. We both saw each other but didnt make eye contact. I immediately called him, no answer, called again, no answer, I texted him saying I want to apologize over the phone; he said he will call me tonight. I just got off the phone with him. He said he really appreciates that I apologized, hes happy to hear my voice and that I was always the realist in the squad. He's two months sober. We have plans to catch up this spring. 

God gave me another chance to repair this friendship and apologize for being a douche to this kid, and I took it. Honestly I was always a skeptic but time and time again I see God's work.",6

Hi SD Family! I am so excited to be doing the DCI this week!

Well what came to my mind is how did you decide on your user name?

A little background on me. My dad was drunk the night I was born. My young mother was all alone. He was very strict man that drank and cheated on my mother. I remember being beaten with a 2 inch leather belt when I did something he deemed wrong. I grew up in fear.

I was determined to break that cycle. I did not ever want to be him. My kids have always been told that I love them. I read to them, tucked them in every night, we played, hugged and they were secure. We did not have alot of money but they had what they needed. I never drank when they were growing up. I am so very thankful for that!! I was determined that they would have a better life than I did. Now that they are grown, they tell me they had a great childhood. Now that they are parents they can see the sacrifices I made.

I started drinking once they left the house. I never became my dad but was a closet drinker at home every night. I wanted to quit for years but did not do so out of fear. I let that old fear stop me for so long. After a decade, I decided that I really am determined in anything I really really want!! That is where my user name comes from! Where does yours come from or how did you decide on it?

I will not drink with you today!",67

No TL;DR because this isn't something that can be summed up in less than two sentences)

Hey everybody. I figured I would come here because everybody here understands the problem of drinking. I realized it after I had a violent outburst that it was affecting me more than I previously thought. I didn't hurt her. I wouldn't have remembered if I did. What she told me brought me such shame, shame that I will carry forever. I know this can't be fixed. You can't take away the fear you imposed over someone. I lost everything. The only woman I wanted to marry, the apartment we got together, the journey we carried together, the pets we had, and the life I had all gone in the last 3 days. My best friend in the world, I can never be with again. 

I never thought that my drinking was a problem, and I just realized that I have been an alcoholic for longer than I thought I was. I had done some hard drugs previously from xanax, cocaine, and ecstasy. I quit all of those cold turkey but never stopped smoking marijuana and I never stopped drinking. I always thought these were fantastic coping mechanisms but as I reflect, I see now that God had been striking me down to be sober for so long. I quit xanax after a car accident totaled my car (I fought the feelings with marijuana and liquor). I could have died during this, I came to during the crash. I quit ecstasy because the rave life was over for me, so I graduated to the bar life. I quit cocaine because I couldn't pee normally anymore and bankrupted myself, but margaritas were still calming with a blunt. 

I was still drinking when I quit cocaine and moved out of the city I was in that helped perpetuate the usage of my cocaine. I think I amplified my drinking when I moved in with my brother. I was kicked out from his house because of my drinking, and then I met her. Let's call her K. 

I don't want to write about K because it makes me sad as all hell to be thinking about her and how wonderful she was. She pulled me out of a dark place when my father got incarcerated and my brother kicked me out. We bonded like no other, our damn souls intertwined.  We left the bad city we were in, moving near her family (where I didn't know anybody, but I would do anything for K).

And guess the fuck what, I didn't stop drinking. She drinks too but she can handle her liquor, I could never. And I finally did it. I got so damn drunk that she called the cops and kicked me out. I say I don't believe it but I do.

God gave me one last strike. I am now surrendering to my addiction and going to get sober. I have more clarity today than I have had in the last few years. I realize now that God, the Universe, Mother Earth, whoever, gave me my last strike. Everything that I had worked so hard for to acquire like my beautiful apartment, beautiful location, and my beautiful girlfriend were all stripped from me because of my fucking addiction. The ONLY THINGS I WANTED IN LIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM ME.

I am heartbroken, I will be for a long time. I now realize what the problem is and it is me and my damn drinking. I know that the next time I get drunk I will either land in jail or die. The last straw had been dealt for me and it took me losing an angel to realize that.

I have clarity now. I don't want to be the weirdo and try to earn her back or bug her incessantly to take me back. I know she deserves to be happy, and if that is without me then so be it. I know that I ALSO deserve to be happy. I just wish that I had decided to be better earlier. I would still have my life, my animals, and my love.

I found a place to rent. I am staying in town for one month. I am renting an AirBNB, a private loft with my own bathroom, living room, and bedroom. I am going to just get better and relax in a space away from everyone. I will continue to work until the end of March. I decided that if I can't be happy here (why would I want to stay in a town where I don't know anybody and I am constantly reminded about everything I lost?) so I am moving to San Diego come the end of March. I will be moving in with my Mother who is 100% sober. In the last 10 years I maybe have seen her less than 20 times. So I am happy that I will be moving in with family and be able to help her put her life in order (she wants to exercise more, I am a gym nut, this will be good).

I am just sad. I also can't sleep and have zero appetite. Is this normal? I feel mental clarity, but my body is withdrawing. I feel shakey and I am not sure what to do. If you made it this far, thank you for taking the time to read it, it means more to me than you think.",26

And I feel better than I ever did than before a near-fatal biking accident I suffered late November. However, ‘better’ is an answer that does not do any justice. It is a cop-out that's  tangential to “I am good!” when responding to the quintessential small-talk question of:

How are you doing?

I am 21 years old; I had my first drink when I was 18. My daddy is a maintenance drinker— or a ‘controlled’ alcoholic where it is always 11 AM somewhere. Just like his daddy, and all of the men before him and in my family. *Machismo*: why bother going to therapy or getting help when the psychiatrist down the street can serve you a fifth of Jose Cuervo – Gold for a fraction of the price? It is the manly thing to do anyway.

When I first started out drinking, yeah I blacked out a few times...more times than I can count on my fingers. But I got over that, and drunk the facade that I had it under control. I was never a stranger to drinking by my self— I loved it. Early on, I did not understand on why it was a social norm to stigmatize drinking alone. 

It is fun, makes music sound better and time go quicker. Then I learned why it is not a social norm; be cool— put a smile on your face, say “I am good!” rather than “Well I am depressed, bored with the monotony of this internship and I need help.”

Although the blackouts and binge drinking behavior I had were evident that I had a problem, they did not kick-start once I bought myself a fake-ID after my 20th birthday. Flash-forward to the summer after my 21st birthday, a year later, I was already rotating between four stores at my college and three back at my hometown. 

It was the Fifth of July, an 11 hour drinking spree has faded, along with the sense of freedom I got for seventeen dollars a fifth and making out with random girls at a party. It is 4:30 AM, and I have work at 6:30 AM— yeah those gold-paved roads that America promised my dad sure when he emigrated here now looked gilded. It was my first and only time I had to drink at work—the shakes were unbearable. My workplace/internship is the type to breathalyze anyone if there was ever an accident at your site/office. If someone’s H2S monitor had gone off that morning, I would’ve failed that breathalyzer, lost the job, and have failed my family.

Those 24 oz Natural Light cans evolved into Modelos, and those eventually into Hurricanes. Whenever the liquor store last summer had a 2 for 2 deal on Hurricanes—I guess I have to drink both now. Or the rarer 3 for 2.45, now that was a good Monday night. I mean, I would work from 6:30 AM to 5 PM on average, then gym or go on a run six days a week, and only then I would enjoy a half-pint of Cuervo or a Hurricane or three. 

It is not alcoholism; people tell me that “I have my shit together!” – the friends of my father at his work would praise me after they are half a thirty rack deep—praising how they were happy a kid from this working-class neighborhood was going to college. “I have my shit together” —and then life tests that out.

It was the second to last day at work before I had back to college for my senior year. It was 8 AM, a clear-skied Thursday, where I learned the answer to what happened to a coworker. Earlier that week, it was announced that a 23 year old coworker had passed away, no explanation so far. It was rumored that it might have been a motorcycle accident. He was 23, came from a rougher working-class neighborhood than mine, blue-collar, but a well-paying position. He was well-liked too, always joking around and I knew he liked going to clubs—he would suggest bars or clubs to check out with my friends—all around a ‘dope guy’.

Suicide.

By hanging. Not a single clue. Just like that, a person can hide his or her feelings then proceed to take their life; due to emotions that I sometimes know can be too real and suffocating. And that is the problem of a closed door.

My drinking picked up after this, I never got the opportunity to get closure about this unfortunate event until months later. Talk your emotions out, don’t drown them. I chose the latter for the most part of my return that school that term. This is not a humble-brag, but it was a rather successful quarter, thinking again that I had my shit together. I think I was averaging 28-36 drinks a week; definitely a Hurricane or Steel Reserve a day. Hell, there were times where I would drink in class or in the library. Then life tested me out.

85 days ago, I fainted while riding my bicycle home from the library. I had pulled an all-nighter or so and I was really dehydrated. Also running on a copious amount of various stimulants but not limited to nicotine, caffeine and Ritalin.

Thankfully there were people near my bike accident, 911 was called very soon after.

I am fortunate to say that my Glasgow Coma Score was 15/15. What the hell does that mean? It is a score reflective on an individual's brain damage after an accident—how reactive are one's pupil, motor, and motor functions. Completely comatose with bilateral fixed pupils? That is a 3/15 - the lowest score, with death most certain or at best a prolonged vegetative state.

My score of 15 indicates the best possible prognosis, something I am extremely humbled and grateful for. I didn’t even know what a Subdural Hematoma was before the accident; let alone how high the fatality rates for those type of accidents can be. I was at the hospital for 12 days, discharged right as winter break had started.  The only deficits I can say I have at the moment are a difficult (but improving) sleeping schedule and a slight increase of impulsivity.

These are two quotes I said my first day at the hospital according to my sister and friends. A nurse offered me drinking water, which I declined. Instead, I asked “Can I please get tequila instead?” After prompt rejection, my stubborn self asked “What about cranberry vodka?” A good friend of mine who feared my personality would change was extremely relieved to hear this, exclaiming “He’s still ThrowAwayCHE2020!”

I am realizing this is getting long, I am sorry about that. I left alcohol after this accident, I still go out with my friends, but I do not drink, nor do they peer pressure me. It is interesting going out to the bars I used to like or night clubs now. They fortunately re-enforce my goal of permanently quitting alcohol. It has not been easy, especially not before the accident. My face is now clearer and I have received multiple compliments in the form of “Hey ! Wow you look... different! How are you?!”

I am good. But it does not stop there. I do not know why I wrote this today, I hope its not nonsensical rambling.

The details of both addictions are neither here nor there. I remember them both vividly. To put it mildly, ""rock bottom"" shouldn't be a competition. If you want to stop drinking today, I reckon we're both in the same spot.

What I do know is that recovery is a process. The phrase ""road to recovery"" should be taken quite literally. There are detours. There are potholes. There are bumps in the road. I have driven down freeways singing ""Life is a Highway"" along with the car stereo at the top of my lungs...  More recently (two days  ago...) I have softly sung ""Everything's gonna be alright... rockabye..."" in the grocery store as I agonize between a 4 pack of double IPAs and a litre of seltzer...

The seltzer won, but oh dear God, it was hard....

I am an addict. It is something I identify with. Alcoholic... not ready to go there yet. Lemme tell ya about snorting lines off the steering wheel... lemme tell ya about hot showers and transdermal pain patches... but alcohol?? I'm not sure I can describe the other side of that hell, in large part because I know I'm in it. I'll know when I'm on the other side of it. 

I'm not there now.

If you aren't either, welcome to the club. You're not alone.

I know I need to stop. I know I want to. I've gotten better. I know I slip up. I know I can do better.

I know I am not perfect. Perfection is beyond me. Progress, though... I'm okay with progress. Some nights, that's all I have. I'm alright with that.

2. The fact that I am in this position in all- like I am some problem requiring management by other people (I have realised that a sense of control is extremely important to me).

Am focusing on putting a good stretch of time between me and my last binge. Hopeful that these sad feelings will lift in due course.

Waking up without hangover and all that goes with it is a joy.

Another (forgotten) side effect is that the weekends seem to have so much more time in them if you’re not dedicating hours to binging then feeling awful the next day.

For quite awhile now I thought I hated going to work just because I was hungover and would rather be drunk. Now I’m realizing I just don’t like my situation.

I’m on this uncertain path towards taking over a family members business, due to them being laid up and being at the age of retirement, but it’s never been explicitly stated whether they’re coming back to work or not. I never really asked to be in this position and it’s becoming more and more clear to me I don’t want to do this thing I’ve been thrown into. The only thing is that backing out would leave another family member alone in it, who has kids to feed and a family to provide for, thus he only works 3-4 days a week while I work the full 6. We are supposedly taking this business over together but again it hasn’t been made clear what the timeframe is. 

There’s also a whole other issue involving my dad who doesn’t work with us anymore because he and my other family member got into a terribly personal argument. My dad and I weren’t talking for awhile because of it but we have mended things recently which feels good. 

I know this is all jumbled up and not really going to make much sense. I’ll probably try to organize my thoughts a little better another time. I just needed to try to write it down to see if it helps me feel any better. I’m trying not to be too specific in the odd chance that a family member ever reads this sub, as I haven’t really expressed any issues with anyone close to me. But I know I’m stressed to the point of exhaustion and the whole thing has me really depressed, and it’s a large reason why I used to drink. I’m strongly considering taking a huge pay cut and just working at Whole Foods for a bit till I figure out what path to take. I just don’t want to screw up the family business, or realize I can’t live off less money. Luckily my fiancé works and we don’t have any kids, which is why I feel this is the right time to make a change if I think it’s going to be better for my health. 

Despite freaking out about all of this, drinking will not make anything better, it’s time to confront this thing. 

Anyone else have any issues working with their family?",8

I found this out Friday night and have had no desire to drink though I’m still processing it.

—-

Three months ago I got drunk again, crashed a car and in doing so broke more promises and had to move out from my partner ending a relationship.

I have since gone to AA, gotten sober almost 50 days now and started recovering.

Over that time my ex partner and I still spoke. And I have continued to help where I can financially and with gardens etc at our former shared house.

Over the time we have gone through stages of chatting and talking and these have been up and down.. feeling like we’re getting along and the like she hates me.. and it was very confusing. Through the work I’ve done in aa and looking at myself I’ve managed to stay out of the weeds. I haven’t retaliated to any name calling or anything and kept doing as they say “the next right thing”.

Two weeks ago she came over to watch a movie with my daughters and I. We visited the next day our shared house and swam together in the pool.
Then for the next week or so she wouldn’t talk to me even though nothing really happened.

Then started chatting again.. she actually apologised for snapping at me which was good. And we started being okay with each other again

Then she came over again this Friday.. but said she needed to talk to me. You know that’s not normally good.. well it was that she had caught up with a friend since we broke up and although they have bern friends for a long time I’d never heard about him in 18 months together. Anyway.. she had slept with him twice since we had been apart. She was feeling bad about lying about it and that’s why whenever she started feeling closer to me she would start pushing me away again. Officially we are separated so it’s not cheating but we had agreed to tell each other if we were starting to see other people. We broke up mostly because of my drinking not because it totally wasn’t working and there was always hope it might get back together.

So she was upset telling me and there are still a lot of emotions and things to work out between us if we ever can get back together. But now she says she wants to try seeing if there’s small steps we can take towards that.

This is something I wanted and it’s good, but I’m not sure how I feel about the rest. I’m hurt but not really angry not that I feel yet anyway. I know I need to feel and express and not just go along to something I want without being sure I’m okay with what’s happened. At least I get an explanation for the sudden turns of feeing from her - it was her own feelings about what she’d done and been misleading about. 

Anyway I’ve got all this in my head and needed to get it out. 

The key point being I’ll deal with this and be okay and won’t drink!

Fears of choking on food are making it almost impossible to eat unless I am drunk.  

For those of you who will read. I did 2 days (mostly) sober right before New Years. At the end of the second day I had (what I now assume to be) a panic attack. Felt Like my throat was closing up and I couldn’t breathe. I had my roomates call me an ambulance and went to the hospital, was open about my drinking and was given 10mg of benzodiazepine to take the edge off. I went home and have continued drinking every day since, although I do try to limit my alcohol intake. This is proving harder now that I am consciously doing it. All I can think about is when my next drink will be.  When I go to eat, I’m either uninterested in food or I am afraid to choke on it.  Which prevents me from swallowing. I now have to take little bites and chew a lot and swallow with water, or preferably beer.  Also if I have mucus in my throat or nose, I get a fear of getting clogged up or choking on it. Has anyone else experienced things like this?  Please feel free to ask any questions or discuss. I am stuck, scared and do not know what to do. I have to go away next week for an entire week of work training and I am terrified that I am not going to get through it because I am struggling so much with this alcohol and anxiety.",3

Then I thought I'd have a nice hot toddy because the weather was so cold. Of course, I had to.buy and entire bottle for that. And it didn't last long.

I know where this leads. It leads to waking up on the bathroom floor heaving my guts out and thinking I might literally die.

I also had a dream I was in Vegas, I was standing on a balcony with a random woman and she looked at me and said “guess I don’t need this anymore” and tossed a 10yr chip over the railing. I chuckled and said I should do the same as I looked at my 24hr chip. The entire dream was just me walking around with that chip in my hand debating on if I wanted to drink or not. I woke up as I chucked the chip into a pond.

Of course getting sober benefits everyone around me, but I realized that when I try to do it for other people, I fail. 

This time last week is was drinking 500-750ml of vodka a day. If I had something important to do — something that requires mental concentration — it had to get done by 10:00 am. After that I was drinking and could not concentrate in any useful way. 

On Tuesday I began a three-day medically-supervised detox at home, with the use of benzodiazepines (a carefully dosed prescription). 

For anyone contemplating this: I can’t tell you what a painless, smooth process this was, at least for me. I was dreading it, because for me the withdrawal symptoms were real... and a huge barrier to quitting. I’d start feeling them by 9am every morning, and the time at which I had to start drinking to keep the withdrawals at bay kept getting earlier and earlier. 

But my detox was withdrawal-free, I’m off the benzos and feel great. 

Yesterday I got up, went for a light run, sat down and tackled a bunch of bills that have been piling up for two months, called my career coach (I’ve been avoiding him), and fessed to my problem. 

And GET THIS: I went to Costco and for the first time in years DID NOT BUY four bottles of vodka and a case of beer (“I’m throwing a party,” I was always prepared to say to the cashier). That was huge for me. 

This is the first Saturday in forever that I’ve woken up feeling clear-headed and refreshed. Oh, and I have a complete memory of everything that happened last night. Wow. 

I feel like I’ve overcome a major obstacle to recovery. I also know this is where the real hard work begins. I’m doing outpatient rehab and hope to learn the tools to stay sober. I’ve done AA and not sure it’s for me (not ruling it out), but I know I need to find a community (beyond this one). 

So many of you have months and years of sobriety, and I’m sure this all sounds familiar. 

To those of you who are struggling with or contemplating sobriety: if you find you can’t quit because of physical dependency, I urge you to consider detox. AFAIK any physician can prescribe the treatment, even at urgent care or ER. Or if you have insurance, ask if they have an addiction medicine counselor (that’s what I did). It’s by no means THE solution to sobriety; not at all. But for me at least it’s helped me build the initial foundation to get there. You can’t get sober till you stop drinking. And for the first time in who knows how long, I’ve stopped drinking (for five days anyway).

Today is my little girl’s 5th birthday party and I’m beyond thrilled that I’ll be sober and completely present for it. 

Thanks to everyone in this wonderful community!",9

**Intro:**

I've been a long time lurker and have used SD many times when I found that traditional means didn't appeal to me. I am in my mid 20's and throughout this long journey, I've recently celebrated 2 years of sobriety. While I am extremely proud of this achievement, I can say that it wasn't easy. I found myself searching the web for tools for young adults and found little to no resources. 

After doing some research online, I found some tools which were aimed at those who were struggling with alcohol in later stages of their lives. I found myself in AA meetings where I was the only ""young"" one there. I was actually asked if I was present for a school project. Over the course of the last two years, I've been told many times a range of comments from ""you're too young to be an alcoholic"" to ""we don't see young adults here often"". This made an already difficult process even harder. After some time, I found 1 (!) meeting aimed at young adults, which only gathers once a week. 

It was during these meetings that I got to speak with other young adults and found I wasn't the only one who was struggling with a traditional approach to sobriety.  After speaking to many, I found that the majority of them gave up traditional means. Some of these were success stories, where they were able to find their own ways to deal with addiction/sobriety. However, many spoke to me (and I personally know a few) who attended one meeting and never returned. It was through this journey I found r/stopdrinking and started chatting with other ""young alcoholics"" about their struggles using traditional means. 

These young adults who stopped attending meetings and found no help directed at young adults in traditional support were experiences that really broke my heart. A few of us have started working on a website which is aimed at young adults struggling with alcohol addiction. Our goal is to create a hub for young adults, where they can find age-appropriate support, whether governmental or non-profits support, specific to their location. The moto, ""Support for & by young alcoholics"". We are hoping to create a chat system, similar to r/stopdrinking, where young adults can meet anonymously to discuss struggles, goals and implement community support, for and by young alcoholics. 

**Sorry for the long post, here are my questions**:

1. Would you (young adults of /stopdrinking) be interested in such a hub/website/support?
2. If so, what type of resources, tools and features would you like to see implemented?
3. Are you aware of young adult resources aimed at those struggling with alcohol addiction (websites, books, apps & anything really!)? Please name the resource, their website and country of origin. Our team (of volunteers) are looking at cataloging these resources to eventually add them to the website. 

We look forward to any suggestions, comments or questions you might have.

I'm still getting used to actually /feeling/ things, so the butterflies in my stomach had some real magnitude all week. But I think I nailed it. I seriously thought about having some drinks to celebrate but ultimately decided, why ruin this? Besides, today I have plans to hang out with my friend who's been struggling to get sober too and who just got out of the hospital from a detox after relapsing. I gotta stay real to be a good friend.

Instead I did something I never would have done before; I went out to see some live DJs for cheap--by myself. I wanted the option to just turn around and leave if it was too crowded, loud, and boozy. So I didn't invite any of my like 3 friends. But it was none of those things, and I had a great awkward fun time. I didn't talk to literally anyone, but just being there was a big step for conquering my anxiety and trying to start developing a personality and social life. And I think sitting around at home would've made me more likely to drink. Ironic that going out to a bar helped me stay sober.",16

I've promised to go to a friends birthday party later tonight and there will be tons of alcohol. I haven't really had any major problems from withstanding alcohol at social events, I just sip on my NA beer or a soda and usually leave pretty early but tonight I just feel like giving in.

2020-02-15 11:49:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f4bzjs/falling_in_love/,Falling in love.,"Wow, that can suck sober, huh?
I wasn’t my best self last night. All of HALT was there. I went through a family tragedy in the morning. I didn’t eat. I haven’t slept comfortably in a long while due to having a new puppy. And anger was just a combination of agonized feelings I felt about my day and that tragedy. 

My family goes hard on vday. My parents got engaged on it. As siblings, we would give each others cards and presents (2 boys/2 girls household) and it was one of our best family traditions/days. My ex used to make this day somewhere of a torturous day for me; intentionally refusing to do anything, often gleaning for a fight. 

I was genuinely so excited to spend a peaceful, loving Valentine’s Day with a man I am crazy about. He’s like no one else I’ve ever met or been with or have ever wanted to be with. He makes it so easy to want to wake up daily in a state of presence. But as it happens, all my triggers happened last night and I was both overwhelmed and stunted. I acted prickly, raw, and unnerved by the plan he’d put together. And all I kept thinking was: a glass of wine would take all this way. I’d be softer. I’d be safer. I would know how to say what I’m really scared of and about. I’d be flirtier. It would really be Valentine’s Day if he could have a glass of red wine with me. (I worked in advertising for a long time, it works.)

I wrote this post because I felt a momentary itch again for that glass (let’s be real and say bottle) because I woke up this morning feeling naked and sheepish. But I reminded myself: I can remember what I did last night. And I would take every last bit of sheepiness over the exhaustion and embarrassment of not knowing who I was or what I did.

I wrote this post because I stopped drinking because I want to be present. And that’s true, even for the icky parts. 

Thanks, all. IWNDWYT.",12
2020-02-15 11:46:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f4bxwh/longest_i_have_been_sober_1_month_today/,"Longest I have been sober, 1 month today","Today I have hit 31 days sober, which is the longest sobriety streak I have ever had. No sip of a cocktail after a week. No caving in and buying a bottle of wine after 2 weeks. 31 days and not a drop. That feels so weird to think about.

I feel (and pray hard) that this is the time that sticks. This is the first time that I’m genuinely doing it for myself, because I want it and I want to learn how to love myself. 

The past year and a half of failures and relapses had me quitting for all of the wrong reasons. I need to quit for my health and stability. I need to quit for my family. I need to quit for my fiancé. All good reasons, but it was compelled by obligation instead of personal desire. There was always that part of me that said, “Someday we can drink again when things get better.” I was not doing it for the most important person in my life, me.

It took losing a job, 4 months of unemployment, losing my fiancé, and then going through withdrawal completely alone after my last bender to finally confront myself. When you lose so much, that is the one thing that will always stay with you, yourself.

Yesterday I got my first paycheck at my new job and wanted to cry. I paid my bills, took care of some debts, and still have some money in the bank. Things that used to feel so overwhelming to me just a month ago are manageable now. Anytime I get frustrated or irritated, it’s only a passing feeling instead of something that looms over me the whole day.

My ex-fiancé and I are still trying to figure out if we want to work things out or not, and honestly that is probably the only thing in my life that is causing me emotional distress right now. She is scared to ever trust me again from the years of me lying because of the drinking and lying about the drinking, and I don’t blame her. She is so proud of me with this new job and new take on sobriety, but scared that this will just be another high point before another inevitable relapse. All I can tell her is that this time is different because I want it for myself, regardless of whether we get back together. The only thing I can do right now is keep living this new life I have, which is hard in the sense that I have to move on expecting that she won’t be apart of it anymore. 

Oddly enough, the easiest part of sobriety so far has been not drinking. It’s confronting all of the turmoil of my past and the relationships with those who I love the most that have suffered from my drinking that really is tough.

This community has been my rock this last month with encouragement and resources. I have a busy job where going to daily AA meetings wasn’t really possible. Instead I pop on this subreddit a few times a day and read the encouraging post of those facing many of the same problems that I have. At night I try to read a chapter of This Naked Mind.

Every day life brings a little bit more happiness out of small things that I either didn’t care for or have the patience for when I was drinking. It’s like I’m experiencing the same things in my old life on a new and deeper level, and it’s so much more satisfying.

I know I don’t post much, but I want to say thank you so much to those that do. I read those post everyday to reflect on and continue my own sobriety.

I’ve felt much better now in the ways I always thought alcohol made me feel better, e.g. more social, less anxious, having more fun, plus generally feeling more healthy and energetic.

The weird thing is I feel like I can still sense the habit or thought patterns that fueled my drinking.  Against all logic and the certainty that I feel better in so many ways, there’s a deep part of my brain that still thinks it’s so much fun drinking with friends on a night out, or that when it’s Friday or Saturday it’s time to drink some beers and relax, etc.  I’m not actively thinking these things, in fact, I don’t even feel like drinking ever anymore.  But I was originally planning to break for 100 days, and I can feel that if those days were up now and I were to drink even once in a time and place I thought would be appropriate, I would so easily slip back into those patterns of thinking “it’s time for a drink” on a daily basis.  

Anyone else notice anything similar?  I’m planning on keeping going with this, and I hope this weird deep unhealthy mindset around drinking I built up over the past years goes away.  If it doesn’t, I’m for sure never reintroducing alcohol into my life in any capacity.",8

The article may help me, and some other folks, I guess. The problem with my relapses was that after a month or several months, I have told myself - in my familie from both sides there was no problems with drinking, and thus I can control drinking. The article shows that some animals has a different brain structure, and they can't process the alcohol normally. I thought because of my Italian part of me, I am immune to alcohol since there are not alcoholics in Italy. But in Italy still they have a large number of people red wine lovers with liver cirrhosis, these are dependent people. They just don't behave as it's common for the drunks to behave in northern countries of Europe. The article showed to  me that 13% of any population just can't process the alcohol normally. And the only way is to stay away from the substance. Surprisingly the AA founders were right - it's kind of an allergy, the dependent people can't just process the substance property.  I don't like AA, but I admire people who don't drink for years, and I saw such people in AA. But I am not a believer and always wanted to find a scientific answer to the problem.  And I never could until I found this article.  Well, today for me is a day one. In my drinking career I have switched from beer to spirits, and then to red wine - and the red wine showed to me, that it just not necessary to be drunk for just thinking about the glass, and the next glass, and yet another glass.  Scary how  rats and people are similar when dependent to the alcohol.  I am not a doctor, but it seems to my that alcohol abuse does not relate to the stress level in life. The past year was not bad for me, but I elected to drink the red wine and a lots of it. It's difficult to admit but there are people with a defected brain structure, and they can't just drink. I am one of them.

I tend to read a lot that many people drank too much yet didn’t eat. This seems alien to me - alcohol makes me ravenous. I eat everything in sight after a heavy drinking session.

My issue was that I wouldn’t drink in the week. But when it got to the weekend, I’d drink a crate of beer and a bottle of wine plus lots of food would accompany that.

I put on so much weight between 2008 and 2019 all because of beer, wine and food.

When I DON’T drink, my diet and exercise regime is very good. I’ve already lost weight since giving up the alcohol again and I actually enjoy the gym rather than make excuses not to go.

Anyone else give up the drinking for these reasons?",56

I have been averaging 7-8 hours a night. That is not bad especially considering I got worse while drinking. Sure, the hours back then were comparable. The quality was not.","Yesterday the first desire to drink hit this sober attempt and passed almost instantly. I had a rough work week. It is exciting and I am a passionate person yet there are personality conflicts on the team I am working on resolving. I am leading one aspect of this initiative while others lead other aspects. I am encouraging people to play to their strengths. I cannot do this alone as others have skills I do not. I have skills they do not. Those skills include psychology and technological aptitude in a generalizable skill (many orgs have this role). I also hold amateur status in a lot of other skills.

Some on the team are attempting to do things they have very little aptitude in despite me staying out of their specialties... other than me learning from them/asking questions. For one person in particular, they are doing it because they are a bit overwhelmed and they are not sure what to work on. They should likely stick to product management as they are good at that. I do value them and respect them yet not when they try to do what they are not experienced in and get defensive when I try and help them. I am tweaking my method of help as I do not yet know what will work for this person. Part of the problem is the pace is so fast the team is building rapport at the same time we are doing a crazy high amount of work. I am averaging over 60hrs a week. I do not mind if people want to learn what I do, but not barrel through it and ignore people (me & others) that have done it for over a decade. I can learn from newer people too and want to especially if they are good at collaboration.

I need to get past a year sober again (my only other attempt) and beyond. My patterns of behavior will be much more established and my sleep will be better. I will be better equipped to weather that which, frankly, is minor. What I am dealing with isn't all that big of a deal. My mind is unpracticed at dealing with it without alcohol. Of course I understand the value in living in the present moment. It is also nice to have things to look forward to. Being practiced at sobriety is one such thing. :)

Anyway, thanks for letting me vent and work through this and any feedback is appreciated.

&nbsp; 

I work with a group of maybe a dozen guys. Last week, something happened and there were a couple of guys who were seriously hurt ... like race to the ER hurt. People did what they were trained to do and everyone is going to be okay, but it could have easily gone another direction ... like procession to the cemetery direction.

&nbsp; 

I'm the only sober one in the group. When the two guys who got hurt are healed up and back to work, there will be a little party to commemorate their return.

&nbsp; 

I'm tempted to bring a fancy bottle of spirits for a toast. I'm not going to drink, not even considering it. I'll have a sparkling water. What I'm wondering is if it would be a hypocritical move for me because there's more than one guy who is clearly struggling with alcohol and I don't want to encourage or enable their problems.

&nbsp; 

I want to set a good example, but I also want to properly mark the occasion. If anyone is wondering, if I hadn't quit drinking, toasting the event would be a pretty normal thing to do.

I am having my wedding shortly, I was more than happy to buy some alcohol for everyone attending (the adults who drink)-- some time ago I thought maybe I would have a dry wedding. But, I am ok with it-- folks can enjoy themselves if they wish, I only bought a little bit, not an open bar like some would do at a wedding.

If you read this, while you are perhaps only just beginning your journey on sober life--- give it a good try, I tend to think of it like this...

Would you put your mouth around the exhaust pipe of a car and breathe in? no? toxic right???? 

Well, excess alcohol is toxic too *shrugs*

I have a serious debilitating anxiety disorder and I’ve used alcohol to suppress and self medicate for close to 4 years now. 
I realize this is the healthy thing to do. I wake up and I don’t feel like dying. I don’t spend the first 3-6 hours of the day nursing myself back to “functioning” levels so I can maybe get out and do something productive before I get fucked up again. I’m not spending $20-50 a day on killing myself. 
I feel like I can’t get a break though. My anxiety is relentless and I feel abnormal amounts of stress from daily mundane tasks. The only thing I ever looked forward to was getting fucked up at night because I knew it would give me a few hours of not feeling like the world is caving in on me. 
I’ve gone to A.A on and off for the better part of a year but I’ve had really negative experiences with the groups and sponsors I’ve gone to and it’s really put a sour taste in my mouth for the whole process. 
I’m so proud of everyone on here when I read how they feel better and are leading healthier and more fulfilling lives but I just don’t feel that way and I’m afraid I won’t. 
I’m still getting pretty intense moods swings daily and I know it’s alcohol related because they start as soon as I would typically start drinking in my normal getting drunk schedule. 
I’m sorry if this seems like just mindless rambling but I’m really feeling hopeless and I know I have the strength to keep myself from drinking but I don’t even know why I’m doing this anymore. 
I don’t want to be a drunk but I don’t know how to live my life without the crutch of some sort of substance.

I think about drinking and not drinking about a million times a day. It has taken a while but I’m starting to understand that thinking about drinking doesn’t *have* to lead to drinking. I know it might sound obvious to many of you but this is a revelation for me.

The thought of drinking always led to the impulse. I would feel the urge to drink and make plans to purchase that drink and nothing would get in my way. I’d flake out on people, miss deadlines, avoid company, even start an argument to get that person to leave me alone so I could go get my drink. 

Now I still think about drinking. And I’m not beating myself up for thinking about it. I’m just acknowledging the thought, the impulse, the urge while not acting upon it. It both harder and easier than I thought it would be, if that makes sense. It hard to exercise impulse control because I’ve let that particular cognitive skill slide by the wayside over the years. And it’s easier than I thought because it feels very freeing. It’s lifted this massive weight off my shoulders. I don’t have to drink. I. Don’t. Have. To. Drink.

A year ago my MELD was through the roof, either 30 or 32 at one point.  The numbers were bad.  Docs told me I had a 30%'ish chance of 3 months.  Cirrhosis, decompensated with ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, malnutrition, I was a skeleton.  Told I would require a liver AND kidney for a shot at long term survival.

Today I went in for bloodwork, and my MELD is 13, bilirubin 2,  Numbers are all nearing perfect and dropping.  I'm ""Too well to transplant"".  Good f'ing thing, because I also found out I'm losing my health insurance that would cover them.  I've been itching to get back to work anyways, and other than fatigue I feel like a million bucks.

BUT.  All available information says that I should be dead in 2-3 years, and that's quite the kick in the nuts..  If that's true, I may as well just take my SS and go hang out in a tropical place on the cheap.  If I have a shot at 20 years, I'd want to jump back into my career.

Anyone know why there are no stats that show survival after HE/Ascites?  Am I just doomed?  Not scared of dying, but an idea of what the hell I'm really looking at would be huge...  My docs say ""just keep doing whatever it is you're doing"" and admit they don't know.  I find that hard to believe.

Any insights/stories appreciated!",14

(We had been binge drinking before, and I suggested we take at least a month, maybe more, off of booze. I wanted a glass of wine and felt like garbage the next day, even though it was a quarter of what we’d been drinking months prior) We went past all of the wine and liquor at the grocery store today and didn’t even consider it. This is the first time in over a decade we haven’t had a drink on Valentine’s Day, and it feels really freaking great to not try to have sloppy, drunken Valentine’s Day sex, or pass out on the couch at 9:30 at night because we overdid the booze.

Im on day 2 after a relapse and tonight I am dealing with the most intense anger I’ve felt in years. I got home from AA and was hit hard with cravings the moment I walked through the door, this was escalated by my roommates open drink in the fridge. I flew into a rage and kicked my metal bed frame full force, then paced around desperately trying to get a grip and not let myself have an anger relapse.  I couldn’t contain the anger I kicked everything in site. I’m sore as shit now, my back was already screwed up. 


I can’t do this, I can’t become what I was before. I used to get nasty angry. Angry me is worse than drunk me. Angry me is more harmful to myself and others than alcohol. I have got to find a way to deal with this anger that doesn’t involve going on a destructive rampage. How do you deal with anger?",12

For some reason, it started to sound fun.  I did have a stressful day at work, but nothing I can't handle.  I am so glad I didn't drink because I got to feel my feelings.  I swear, it sounds so dorky but it's true.  I had a moment to just be me, rather than drinking away my feelings.  And I was alone with them. I reflected on love because I realized at least four people that I loved very dearly had been hurt by my drinking.  And that's just boyfriends. I started thinking that alcohol has been my true companion and I've put it before other people in my life that I supposedly care about.  And a lot of it is about fear.  Fear of just having those feelings.  It's fucking fascinating.  

Anywho, having feelings, drinking coffee.  Very content to not be drinking and thought I'd post to you all.  The tonight just took a turn for the better because I decided not to drink.  IWNDWYT.",4

I tried my best to get that dog to stop by hitting it with a yard tool.  Apparently, I was also screaming like a banshee and my neighbors came running and got the dog off.  

I spent 4 hours that night at the emergency vet.

So what’s the problem?

Well, I had gotten home early from work and started drinking at 4 pm.   

I was about 3 7% IPA beers in when the attack occurred. 

I drove my cat straight to the emergency vet under the influence of three 7% IPA’s. .

While in the waiting room, the adrenaline wore off and the realization hit me that I could have been passed out and my cat would have been savagely killed.  My neighbors son had admitted afterwards that the dog was a cat killer.  Another scenario was that I would have been way too drunk to drive my cat to the vet etc...

I have never felt such burning shame in my entire life.   I am divorced with no children and My support system lives in another state.  All I have is Daisy the dog and her royal highness, the grand duchess Vera, the cat.  I cried for 4 hours in the waiting room.  Yes, I was extremely distraught over my cat but I was horrified at what my life had become.   

Vera has a few cracked ribs and is in pain.   She is moving around and is drinking and eating.  My poor kitty 🐱.  She is expected to fully heal within 4 to 6 weeks. 

I couldn’t sleep at all because I kept ruminating about past mistakes.   At work, I kept bursting into tears.  They let me go home at noon. I think I had 14 years of repressed emotions finally come to the surface.  My body is yelling at me to stop.  

I don’t want to drink anymore. It’s no longer fun or enjoyable.  It hasn’t been for sometime.   I’m no longer cute and am starting to look like a frumpy middle age person with a drinking problem. 

My neighbors have already reimbursed me for the $346 vet bill.  They are horribly sorry and so on.  

As today is Valentine’s Day, I’m spending it with my courageous cat Vera who fought back as best she could (9 lb.  cat vs 80 lb dog) and my dog daisy. They love me even though I’ve been out of it plenty of times.

This is probably my first post (unless I posted whilst off my nut, which is distinctly possible).

I stopped drinking (and using) about 19 months ago through CA (like AA, but with added cocaine stories) and it's mostly been great. Life's tricky when I'm feeling shit and I can't hide in a 4 pack of special brew but that's just life I guess?

Anyway, went to a meeting this evening where I do service and got an absolute earful from someone I was recently trying to help (getting called a rude cunt, fake something something, whatever) and stormed out. I was supposed to be taking the meeting and left it for someone else to pick up the pieces. I won't write my inventory on it here but just wanted to say thanks for being here because it's been a fucking stressful week and I really needed some recovery tonight. I felt unable to call my usual people on the assumption they're all having fantastic evenings with their gorgeous other halves while I sit on my own reading Reddit, waiting for a curry. I now feel a little less trapped in my own head.

1: ''Tracy`s binges usually lasted about two weeks. As he did not like to fly, he would take the Santa Fe Chief and the Twentieth Century Limited trains to New York (about four days) and check into the St. George, carrying a suitcase filled with whiskey bottles. According to a St. George bellhop I interviewed in 1960, Tracy would lock himself in the room, strip naked and get into the bath tub. He would remain in the bath tub for a week, drinking up all the whiskey, and not having to get out of the tub, even to perform bodily functions. At the end of the week, his binge having run most of its course, he cleaned himself up, dressed, took the suitcase, now containing empty bottles, and checked out. . . .''

I already had developed a really unhealthy relationship with alcohol at that point, so when we’d fight I’d just drink more to cope with it. He was abusive, but over time getting drunk together every night and getting into horrible fights just became normal.

I remember one specific instance where we were fighting and drunk, and I took his liquor bottle and started to pour it down the drain. He punched me in the face. I remember numbly finding it odd that all the horrible things I had said didn’t seem to incite anywhere near the amount of rage in him that pouring that liquor down the drain did. 

I finally broke up with him when I was 22, blocked all the numbers he tried to call me with, and never spoke to him again. He died a couple years ago, I know it was due to alcohol but I’m not sure of the exact cause.

Fast forward to now. I’m 27. My boyfriend is amazing. I still drink, but in my head I’ve “gotten better”. I only drink on weekends, I don’t drink liquor. Except, once in a while, I’ll drink a little too much, and something small and stressful will happen...and I’ll go absolutely insane. I’ll start screaming at whoever is around (pretty much always my poor boyfriend). Telling him he’s a piece of shit, he’s worthless, and I hate him. All the things I remember my ex doing and telling me years ago when he’d get drunk, and I’d always believe him, every time he did. I never remember saying these things when I wake up. My mom told me that it’s some kind of PTSD reaction, but I don’t know. All I know is I’m an ass hole. My boyfriend always forgives me and I always promise that I’ll control it better when I’m drinking. 

Last night I had 7 or 8 beers, I think. I can usually handle that easily, but I’ve been eating super low carb/low calorie the last couple weeks. It REALLY hit me. My boyfriend said something I didn’t like, I don’t even really remember what it was...and I lost it again. Screamed at him, called him names. Woke up alone in the bed with him on the couch and at first I didn’t even remember why. 

He cried and told me what I said. I had called him a piece of shit, screamed that I hated him, said I wanted to break up. He said that I make him feel horrible when I’m drunk...that when I’m sober he loves me, but he hates the person I am when drunk more than anyone on the planet. He’s still not talking to me right now.

I threw all the leftover beers I bought in the trash. I’m not drinking any red wine for Valentine’s. I’m done hurting him so badly and not even remembering it the next day. I’ve tried to stop a few times before, but I’ve never felt as resolute about this as I am now. I refuse to be like my ex. I may not have the self-love to stop drinking for myself, but I have the love needed to do it for my boyfriend. 

No more. Ever again.

Daily smoker and bottle and a half a day of wine drinker/ 3-6 beer drinker with weekend binges for a year and a half. 26 y/o male. Immediately went into a two week long withdrawal. Symptoms subsided after a month. Now i’m in the PAWS phase. Loving AA as its a place where I can meet people who’ve actually beaten this. Still have minor twitching that goes away day by day. Doc said its part of the “de-pickling” process and it can take months and for some people even years for the nerves to achieve homeostasis again. Now i’m slaying the final dragon of quitting caffeine. 

Don’t ever want to experience withdrawal again so won’t drink. Guy I went to AA with told me it took him 6 months to feel like himself again. If I ever have kids I’d like them to grow up without their parents drunk.

Questions. Can I have foods with vinegar or soy sauce? Anyone in the 6+ month sober period can confirm their healing?

Honestly the best thing about this is that I feel like I can help other people going through this now, whether its AA, a friend, or this subreddit. I feel like a Knight who has sworn an oath to not drink. 

AA helps. This subreddit helps. Therapy helps. Finding a higher power helps. Nutrition helps. Sleep helps. Music helps. More sleep helps. Drinking a fuck ton of water helps. Walking helps. Reading books about this helps (alcohol explained, this naked mind, brain in balance, the big book, the bible.) If one has a problem as big as this why not throw the book at it. Grit and determination helps. I’d like to think that since i beat the withdrawal the hard part is over now and all i have to do is not drink or smoke and the pieces will come together. IWNDWYT.",6

I've managed to work myself into a downward spiral of depression and anxiety, that I haven't been dealing with perhaps for a decade now. Whilst at uni I got myself hooked on coke and MDMA to the point I was giving presentations off my tits. Didn't help that my dealer lived 5 minutes away. After my degree I took myself back to my parents home and got completely sober, drink, drugs, everything.

Wind forwards 8 years and I'm sinking 8 cans of beer and half a bottle of hard liquor or a bottle of wine. Every. Fucking. Night. I then got into a habit of downloading Grindr and hooking up with random guys most nights (I'm in a relationship, well, I was).
Once that said relationship ended a month ago, and whilst we're still living in the same house, i decided shit really has hit the fan and i need serious help. 

Although I've been on antidepressants for 3 years, I started counselling last week and took myself off work for 6 weeks to at least start to mend. 

I've cut back on the booze, but am still drinking every night. No more random boys though. Just came back from the shop with six cans. My housemate asked where I'd been, told her ""cigarettes and snacks"". She knows better than to believe me. Felt so guilty I decided to post. Writing it down has made me realise how badly addicted I get. I mean, heck, I've got around 10 empty bottles of pinot hiding under my bed.

Edit: I posted this in a different post, but decided after last night's binge that I needed to create a new one. Yes, I poured 8 cans of beer and half a bottle of bourbon down my throat and slept with some random. Again. Woke up at 2pm, missed my therapy appointment, missed my doctor's appointment. I can't keep doing this. Time for damage control. Time to get rid of the empties. I'm done.

A lot of other people in this sub talk about it, too. There’s this idea that if, miraculously, it’s possible to stop after one or two drinks for one night, surely I won’t get blackout and embarrass myself the night or week after. 

This is what I call the Moderation Mirage. 

I convince myself I can moderate, but it’s all an illusion. The only real way for me to stop damaging drinking habits was to go totally dry and ignore this mirage completely. I’ve had too many nights where I tell myself I’ll stop at two or three and then it’s ten drinks later. 

So, looking into Valentine’s Day weekend, I will not drink with you today and tomorrow. Even though I’ll take my girlfriend out and she might have wine, I know I personally have to ignore the moderation mirage. I won’t even have one glass. And if I do that, the night will be infinitely better! 

Happy Friday everyone and stay strong against the moderation mirage!",42

Thankfully, no one really sees that picture except for me.    


I'm about to renew my driver's license, which means a new photo.  There will be one less photo of my hungover self.  My new driver's license will show me \~40 pounds lighter with glowing skin.  Yay.   


But I find myself not wanting to ever change my employee photo.  It has become a talisman of sort.  It is a reminder of who i was, and who I will quickly become if I decide to pick up the bottle again.   It isn't just about me looking better (though i will say i feel a lot sexier :-p )... that picture just shows how absolutely miserable i was.

I posted this a while ago, and I’ve been struggling a bit. I haven’t had a drink in almost 8 years, and while I’m not about to start now, Things can still be hard. This is a good reminder for myself and maybe it will help someone else:

PSA: I DIDN’T GET SOBER FOR THIS SHIT: 

I didn’t get sober to play it safe, to take the easy way out, to not take risks, to not make every single day a new quest for buried treasure. I didn’t get sober to sit around and think about how scary the future might be. I didn’t get sober to not embrace change, to make decisions based on fear, to not make decissions based on fear. I didn’t get sober to live in fear.

I didn’t get sober to not fulfill my purpose in this lifetime. To not discover what that purpose might be. To not be painstaking about what I desire and who I fucking desire and what I deserve and who I don’t need around me anymore. 

I didn’t get sober to feel sorry for myself, to listen to that ever-so subtle voice in my head that says “you aren’t good enough”. I didn’t get sober to wonder whether I am valued by the people in my life. To feel like I’m as important as what color socks someone might happen to put on this morning. I didn’t trudge through a thousand foul fires of self-centered, self-loathing fears and make it through to the other side (against all odds) just to hear someone say “I like you, buttttttttt…” I didn’t get sober for this shit.

I didn’t get sober to play games, to cut corners.  I didn’t get sober to be the same person. I didn’t get sober to feel invisible or misunderstood or alienated. I didn’t get sober to hide or cower or crawl or crumble. I didn’t shatter every single one of my beliefs and dismantle every single idea about my Self and then put the pieces back together in a perfectly imperfect fashion, only to second guess myself. I didn’t get sober to apologize for the full magnitude of the person I am, for the person I fought to become. 

I didn’t arise from the ashes like a phoenix to censor myself, to be tamed by someone else’s whack standards. To be that brand that everyone likes, that girl who everyone thinks is sweet. To wonder if I’m making the right choice. To not trust myself. To settle. I didn’t get sober for this shit.

I didn’t get sober to avoid getting my heart broken, to avoid falling apart, to avoid getting hurt. I didn’t get sober to lie to myself, to say “maybe this time it will be different”. I didn’t get sober to make the same ole mistakes, I got sober to make new ones and to learn from them. I didn’t make it out barely still alive to be complacent, to be quiet. To please anyone but myself. To give my power away to other people. To give my heart away. To act like it’s not the most precious thing I have–like I’m not the most precious thing I have. 

I didn’t get sober because I was scared to die, 

I got sober because I was scared to NOT live.

I didn’t get sober to not preach to myself every day. To not feel empowered. To not know that I am a sandstorm, a force of nature, an atmosphere, an eternal garden of Eden. To not be the Queen of my own Existence. I didn’t get sober to fear what anyone thinks of me, to fear what anyone listening right now thinks of me. To not make the remarkable dream that I dream a reality. Every single day. I didn’t get sober to not be in love with myself and in love with my life and my friends and my job and my mind and my spirit. To not be in love with my flaws. To not feel. Everything. To not grow, transform, unfurl, unwind, let go, be held. To not be true to myself, to not be authentic. To not show up just as I am right now.

I’m not looking for someone to fix or to complete me or make me happy or call me babe or buy me shoes..., I’m looking for me, and I'm looking to reinvent me as often as necessary for true growth to occur. I’m looking find the beauty I have yet to truly see. Im looking to build empire,  to destroy some shit and rebuild,  to hack into some scars, slay some dragons, jump through flaming hoops, and to make some irreversible leaps of faith.

 I don’t need someone to buy me dinner or “like” my Instagram posts or tell me I’m pretty. I want to be peeled back, uncut, unedited, unfiltered, stripped raw, I want to be here, just as I am, sober, perfectly imperfect, a child of the universe,  or I don't want to be anywhere else at all.",69

We’ve not spoken in years... it got worse! Valentine’s Day became a fifth of vodka or gin alone in my room, half naked playing video games and feeling worthless. 

I made my mind up - no more booze. No more drinking. Dec 29 2018. it’s Feb 14 (duh!) 2020 now. I have a girlfriend I’m truly in love with. She understands me, she’s sympathetic, she’s joyful, she’s smart. She’s compassionate and sexy, brilliant and fun. Every time I look at her I feel peace and comfort. Every time she and I speak I smile. Every time I hear her name I grin like a fool! I’d love to each have a few glasses, maybe a bottle each, of champagne and giggle like idiots into the wee hours of the morning. 

But I wouldn’t love what would happen after. I’d fall back into my habits. I’d traipse back in, slowly at first, then with regularity, to the liquor stores I abandoned. I’d slug back those sugary bottles of champagne over the next few weeks and months. Vodka, beers, gin, mixed drinks. I can almost taste a hint of lime and tonic just typing this. I’d get fatter again - I’d fall off my meds cycles and find myself late to work and disheveled daily - id sacrifice so much. 

My girlfriend has made it clear - I won’t be drinking that champagne tonight. We’ll giggle and have fun, and maybe fall asleep at 11pm like the old people we secretly are, and not 3am while drunk as hell. But we’ll wake up at 8 or 9 and start our day and go do things... we won’t be stuck in bed hungover until 2pm... we won’t lose seeing our families on the long weekend... 

It’s not a sacrifice. I’m not sacrificing the “fun” of one night of booze for the potential consequences. It’s sabotage. Sacrifice is doing something hard to gain something important. Sabotage is doing something easy to gain something temporary with long term negative consequences.

I can’t remember the exact day I finally got sober two years ago, but I was able to narrow it down to this week in February, so I decided to make Valentine’s Day my sobriety date, so I could celebrate my radical act of self love on a day that is traditionally fraught with all kinds of strange expectations and disappointments, never mind the rather gruesome death of a saint named Valentine.

Six years ago, I woke up in a sketchy studio apartment in a Mexican resort town black and blue, physically and mentally. In what I can only describe as a moment of grace and clarity, I was finally sick and tired of drinking to blackout every night with a bunch of alcoholic expats. The party was over, as I knew it. I knew that I would die if I kept living the way I had been living for 20 years. I was lucky to have survived so much already. Things that should have been my bottom were not my bottom. My bottom finally came with more of a whimper than a bang.

I thought I was finally free, living the dream in Mexico, drinking tequila all day in my pyjamas. I was anything but free. Six years later, I am typing this from my open air kitchen watching my Man Friday paint my new home the most gorgeous shade of pink you ever saw. This might sound like some kind of sober infomercial, but don’t worry, it was a rough and wild ride to get here. And not every day is perfect, life isn’t like that, even sober.

After I woke up that morning, it took me six years to achieve two years of continuous sobriety. My first year, I went to AA on a small Mexican island and managed to stay sober. I went to meetings and I did not drink. A flock of AA snowbirds took me under their wings and showed me another way to live. I walked into that AA room scared and shaky as hell. And I found a group of people laughing about stuff that normies don’t talk about, let alone laugh about. I wasn’t ready to laugh about everything yet, but I could see I would laugh one day at some things I never thought I would be able to laugh about. That meeting shone a ray of light in a very dark place. As Rumi says, “The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” Listening to the stories in that room, I felt like I had finally found my secret tribe hidden away in the Amazon, after wandering alone for years. This isn’t a happy ever after AA love story, but I am forever grateful for the love that community showed me in a time I sorely needed it. And the stories, how I loved the stories…

After a year of sobriety on that tiny island, I had achieved some financial freedom and took off for a life nomadic, driving all over North America in a van. Eventually I drove right into a three year relapse. Nothing great happened in those three years. Most things took a dive, again. And I did not suddenly drink like a normal person after a year of sobriety in case anybody was wondering. With a year of sobriety and some recovery behind me, I could not drink guilt free, with wild abandon, returning to the beginning all over again, like 14 year old me drunk on homemade Italian wine in the basement of a junior high friend. I was still trying to get sober but failing again and again. During those three years, I had so many day one’s, week one’s, month one’s. I can relate so well to those of you who post about your early days and struggles. I will ALWAYS remember that soul crushing anxiety when I woke up at 4 in the morning. I never ever want to feel that again. I loathed that night hag, that demon sitting on my chest in the darkest hours. Waking up without a hangover never gets old for me.

Why the hell did I start drinking again? Because I had not filled the void that led me to drink in the first place. In my sober year, I managed not to put a drink in my mouth, but I hadn’t done any of ‘THE WORK’. I didn’t even know what the work was, yet. I had not started digging around in the past or uncovering any of the reasons WHY i drank. I had not filled, yet alone looked inside, that painful empty hole inside that lead me to drink my life away in the first place. Not putting alcohol in my mouth slowed down the madness, but it didn’t fix me. It was time to do the work.

I agree with Gabor Mate, that addiction is a response to pain. That addiction is a symptom, and not a disease. With all my untreated and unaddressed wounds, I still needed to numb out, disassociate, and replay the trauma bonds of my childhood. I could not get out of survival mode and thrive. I could not escape the cycle of drama and dysfunction that plagues the alcoholic. Then I started to uncover years of childhood trauma and to look into the dark void where the depression and anxiety lived.

Peter Levine says: “Trauma has become so commonplace that most people don’t even recognize its presence”. To recognize trauma’s massive influence on ourselves and those around us is paradigm shifting and explains so much about our behavior and the lives we live. Learning about trauma and starting to heal it changed my life. Learning about trauma was like a Rosetta stone for understanding myself and those around me.

Now, at two years sober, something inside has shifted because I did the work this time. I still do the work every damn day. The idea of drinking seems foreign to me now, the addiction has lifted. But even after something clicks inside, it doesn’t mean we’re never in danger again. But alcohol stops being what we think about every waking moment and sobriety becomes the new normal. We can no longer imagine feeling like hell all the time. We can no longer imagine being hellbent on self destruction.

Not putting alcohol in your mouth is the easy part, but dealing with WHY you drink takes a lot more work. AA works for many. The steps can certainly facilitate the spiritual awakening that Carl Jung deemed necessary for recovery from addiction. I like to think of AA as Stage 1 recovery, and it keeps many sober for a lifetime, but for others, something is missing: what I like to call Stage 2 recovery, where we address things that AA does not, like early childhood trauma, wounds, dysfunction, family dynamics, attachment theory, intergenerational trauma. Therapy is often extremely helpful in recovery. And body work too, yoga, somatic experiencing. Lots of modalities are available to assist in recovery. The ‘work’ is different for everyone, but without doing it, it’s pretty hard to stay sober.

Sobriety is like the classic Hero’s Journey. The hero receives a call to action and crosses the threshold between the world he/she is familiar with into the unknown, doing something he/she has always been scared to do, like getting sober. The hero faces their crisis, their ordeal, and overcomes the challenge. Never to be the same again, the hero returns transformed, having defeated the enemy, ready to share what they’ve learned. Stop waiting to be rescued and be the hero you’ve been waiting for. Love YOURSELF this Valentine’s Day.",1592

Alcohol nearly killed me. Twice. It nearly killed my husband, three times. (Delirium tremens/seizures.) The withdrawal process is hell. I still have good days and bad days....but a bad sober day is lifetimes better than a good drunk/hungover day.

I remind myself how much that first week or two hurts, and that, for me, has been enough to keep any temptation at bay.

I didn't sleep great last night and my mind was racing/wandering and I've been trying to determine new ways to cope and why I was so comfortable with alcohol before.  My wife grew up in a household that was very ""cold.""  No affection displayed whats over. I am very affectionate and feed off her physical touch, doesn't have to be intimate, just to feel close, that she cares for me. Early in our marriage when intimacy was few and far between I began to bargain with myself. If I have a drink or two, I know I'll feel good, if I wait for her to display affection, it may not happen today.  She has gotten better, but I have not.  Now that I'm working on being sober I have this rush for affection and physical touch again. I feel I've espoused a thousand apologies to my wife that won't hold any weight until I prove it to her in action, but I want to share these thoughts with her. 

Am I just making up excuses again or is this a legitimate feeling? 

Am I safe to give weight to these thoughts and share with here what I'm feeling? 

Is it okay to share now and change what I feel later?

I'll probably post here a lot if it's okay, I'm an odd emotional person. I don't share a lot with people because it doesn't feel safe, but singing a few lines to a song can make me cry if I'm alone. This is already an incredibly emotional couple days and I'm glad there is a group like this to lend support.

I do feel like I'm missing out by not going to meetings, but maybe it's only because I want friends. I don't want friendship based on recovery. I feel like that's the same as making drinking buddies.

Well that's it for me, I feel pretty dead set on sobriety. Keeping it going. IWNDWYT.",7

My wife was dumbfounded.  I was shocked.  The conversations this triggered although heartfelt were much harder than I expected.  How close I am to just losing it all for 1 drink is so very fresh in my mind... And now hers again.  Last night was a wake up call.  I'm not just sober now...  I am an alcoholic and must be vigilant for my sobriety.  Was I not listening properly when I opened my mouth?  Ive been to these places before... I should have known.  It's been a really nice recovery so far.  This hiccup makes me feel raw again.  Im grateful it turned out the way it did and ended in I love yous.  I'm just one drink from being lonely.

I’m struggling quite a bit with the social side of things. My partner is very supportive of me quitting drinking. I have periodically asked him to not have been stocked in the house which he is okay with. We’ve fallen back into a pattern of having beer in the house (which is on me - thought I could have one drink to celebrate his new position at work).

While he is supportive of me not drinking, I feel a lot of guilt over not drinking. We did a lot of craft beer stuff when we got together in our twenties. And for right now, it’s a struggle for me to be in certain situations. 

Today is day one again after having a chat with my counselor. Yesterday my partner asked if I wanted to go to a football game this weekend. We just went to one last weekend. And while I obviously don’t have to drink, everyone around me including my partner will be drinking. I think he sometimes struggles to understand why I simply don’t drink.

Situations like that I’m not sure how to handle. I’ve recently gotten some mental health stuff figured out which is helping me a lot with being more social. But I can see my partner is disappointed if I don’t want to do something with him.

Any tips? IWNDWYT",7

And they see you as just hurtful to them. Maybe because you have misinterpreted them. Maybe its because what you have to give has become perverse by your own hate for yourself. Maybe because what was once beautiful is now tainted by pain. And you try to relieve that pain with care for another but cant because you lack care for yourself. And maybe you cant or just shouldn’t try to give because giving is taking what is wrongfully yours. And never was yours to even share in. Maybe you shouldnt have tried at all because its not what they really needed. And therefore by trying only inflicts pain. Maybe you were right for them for a time, but your time has run out. Because what you have, your love, your kindness, your compassion, isnt or is now not good for them, because its now not good for you. Trying to strengthen and support someone is beautiful, it is in our nature to love but when we lack the love for ourselves, you become not the support they need.

Said company does have some major perks and overall great people to work with, which is why I’ve stayed for 7 years now. 

About three years ago, I started to majorly get into craft brewing. I’ve always been on the “runner’s body” side of weight, and when I look at myself now, I’m disgusted with how I’ve let my self go due to drinking. It is the number one symptom of a greater issue, which doesn’t need to be discussed here. 

The point being, alcohol has made me fat (by my standards), lazy, depressed, and stupid. 

I haven’t drank for a week now. I had been wanting to quit for a long time. The guilt and self-loathing grew every single night that I poured open a few beers. And that’s all it was. Every single night, 2-4 beers. 

The issue was that I did this for three years. That has taken a major toll on my body. Some rough patches, I drank more a night. 6-10 beers.  But 90% of the days that I’ve drank, it’s 2-4 a night. 

Now that I’ve stopped for a week, I feel my sense of humor actually coming back. I feel and respond to an inner dialogue again. It feels like my brain is no longer being blocked from thinking and allowing myself to feel. Frankly, I hate it right now. I always have been super energetic and aggressive when I stop drinking. I have too much energy. I think that it’s time to use that at the gym and put myself out there again. 

The addiction to drinking doesn’t have to be a bottle a night. It can be any amount. I was addicted to all sorts of wonderful beer, and I think that I am quite the aficionado now. But, at what cost? 28 is very young. I want to cherish my health. 

I hope and want to keep this streak up. It’s so fucking hard to not drink, and I empathize with all of you struggling with this issue.",12

Sweating then cold.. hungry then sick. I was miserable surrounded by a dirty house from a party the night before. I was scrolling through social media and saw something called dry January. I said hey let’s give it a shot. Instantly I had gone through all upcoming events in my head. I had plans to go to a Casino the following weekend. Dinner plans with friends—a lot. 

Fast forward to the end of the month— I made it without drinking! Shocked! Now on the 18th of January we had met with a few people very close to my inner circle. They came over and I offered drinks to everyone. Conversation with another girl went like this 

Girl “oh what are you drinking”
Me “nothing just some water”
Someone in the room “oh she’s doing dry January”
Girl “ well that’s boring. People only do that to say they are doing it. What’s the point “ (mind you I never told anyone. The person in the room knew because my boyfriend mentioned it to him) 

Now I explained to her my reasons for doing this. She seemed understanding. This is also a person in my life that I have supported now matter what they did. I’ve flown to places to support her, I’ve donated to causes she was raising money for. Always supporting 100%

Fast forward to February. Super bowl Sunday at a friends house. I was already in my own head about whether or not I would have a drink or stay on the sober train. I stocked up on water and virgin Moscow mules mixers. 

Same girl is there... 
In front of a large group calls me out 
Girl “ are you still not drinking ?”
Me” no I figured why not keep it going”
Girl “ no no no after having kids and giving up alcohol for 9 months I will never give it up again. You wouldn’t know about it but just wait.” ( she actually had drinks ..not much but drank during the pregnancy) 
Me “ok cool” walks away. I feel like I had nothing nice to say so I just walked away

Later in the evening I’m making a virgin Moscow mule
She comes to the kitchen
Girl “ what are you making ?”
Me “ virgin Moscow mule. Would you like one?”
Girl “ no what’s the point?”
Me “ I can add vodka to yours if you want. I still enjoy the taste without it and just not the hangover with it”
Girl “ no that’s just ridiculous there’s no point”
Me .. walks away again. 

Now I’ve been listening to This Naked Mind on audible and she talks about situations like this but it certainly does not make it any easier. Luckily I have my boyfriend who has been super supportive even listening to me complain and dissect situations like this one to him. 

Anywho we’re meeting this person again this weekend and I’m still not drinking. I feel nervous as I would only drink to make her shut up. I DO NOT want to do that .. ugh. This inner circle is part of our family and just not speaking is really not an option",3

I listened to music and had a good inner monologue with myself along the way, the evening was refreshingly cold and peaceful and the closer I got towards the shop I could feel desire slipping away, I walked past the shop, shaking my head at the ridiculousness of the situation and headed back home.

I feel so many strange emotions about that evening, how easy it was to give up, how easy it was that I changed my mind despite a horrific couple of days, anger at myself that I promised myself alcohol and denied it, pride that I promised myself alcohol and denied it. 
It gives me hope that I can do that but it is not over yet, I'm on a very thin line and experiencing a new stage of recovery that I have never experienced yet because I've never lasted this long.

I guess I should claim victory, better yet today feels significantly less dreadful, how different things could have been if I walked into that shop last night. 

Also an apology to those who replied to me yesterday, I wanted to reply back and thank you for helping but I was in a rotten mood. It was appreciated though.",11

This is something he does when he's too drunk to have his keys or use his keys - I let him in last week and decided it was someone elses turn and tried to go back to sleep. Then at 3.30am the buzzer goes again, I get up this time and it is the police, I go downstairs and there are ambulances outside, the police wanted to know if X lived here, he had fallen down our high concrete stairs and hurt himself, I didn't see him but they were using a stretcher. I told them where he lived and helped them find his flatmate to go with him.

However, I think this may be a reason why I've been having the issues that I do.  


I am ruining my relationship with my girlfriend of 13 years because of how combative, stupid and sensitive (yet simultaneously insensitive) I become when I drink. I have no off switch, so even when I intend just to have a few beers, I end up going out and drinking 12 or more pints by the end of the night, starting some stupid shit, embarrassing myself and waking up feeling like a moron and trying to reconstruct what the hell I did the night before.   


I've reached my breaking point, and I can no longer justify drinking AT ALL because sooner or later it turns out the same way all over again. I'm quitting drinking entirely, and I don't  have anyone to talk to about this in my personal life, because I've kept my drinking problem private (for the most part).   


I don't really know what to say other than Hello, and that I hope I can look back on this post in a few months, and then again in a few years and finally point to the moment where I said ""Full Fucking Stop"" and got myself and my life back under my own control.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Ended up doing a few shots, moved to the next bar with a few people I barely know, and don’t remember much else afterwards. Someone put me in an Uber home and I am told by my boyfriend I said some horrible things when I got home, that I hated him, etc...
It’s not the first time, and he’s not the only BF I’ve done this to. Just full on rage mode. Which is crazy because sober me is or tries to be very positive.

Lately when I’ve allowed myself to drink, I have been blacking out very quickly. 
And then other times I’m in control, but I really have to watch myself. If I could be like that every time I wouldn’t be here. It’s the blackouts that worry me and I know if I keep drinking I’ll probably always have them because I haven’t ever been able to find a healthy middle ground that lasted.
I don’t know why my brain or body reacts the way it does with alcohol but it doesn’t seem normal.

I gave up drinking last year and went 3 months til I went on vacation. And since then Ive slowly slipped back to a few here and there, mixed in with a night that goes overboard that I have no recollection of. Just not fun anymore when you’re in your 30s.

I think I’m going to give it up again and instead of having no support system this time I thought this would be a great place to not feel so alone. I think  this may need to be a permanent thing for me and not just a break, because my relationship with alcohol has been so unhealthy throughout the years. 
I’m nervous because giving it up means no drinks while traveling, and that’s become such a big part of vacation I’m not sure I have it in me to stay true because even if I drink well on Holiday, it is back home where I drink & slip up the most. So to Day #1. Advice or Tips welcome!",5

I just finished a whole 30. For those who may not know, its a 30-day, restrictive diet where you essentially eat only whole, unprocessed foods. I figured I had some sobriety under my belt and was feeling great, why not give my body another treat by doing a whole 30?

Well, I weighed myself today. And I gained 2 freakin pounds. I was devastated. Finishing this program was a huge accomplishment itself, and I couldn’t figure out why I had felt like such a failure until a few moments ago. 

I realized that one of the things I love most about my sobriety is the feeling of freedom I have achieved. Alcohol had trapped me; I was enslaved to the poison. I’m now free to enjoy my life without the constant itch of wanting to drink. I relish every moment of this freedom. 

Toward the end of this restrictive diet, I found myself falling into similar patterns as when I was drinking. The idea of cooking exhausted me. My entire day revolved around food. I was eating almond butter by the spoonful, even though I felt so full. I felt disgusted and wanting to just stop, to free myself—exactly how I felt before I stopped drinking. I was burdened and trapped and making excuses for eating exorbitant amounts of “compliant” foods. 

I think I wanted to lose weight so badly because I wanted it to be worth it. When I was drinking, i think there was a part of me that also wanted to find the secret hidden in alcohol; the magic which I convinced myself it contained. I wanted my suffering to be worth it. And in both cases, it wasn’t. 

Anyway, tonight I will enjoy a normal serving of popcorn and a generous helping of honey in my tea because SCREW IT it’s delicious. Man, it feels good to be free. IWNDWYT",24

One of the phenomenon that therapists look for is ""discounting the positives"" - we tend to ignore the good and focus on the negative.

I've felt depression sinking in recently again. I feel kind of lost on how to achieve my long-term goals and what's in front of me right now isn't too inspiring. I was thinking of drinking a lot this morning from wanting to turn off anxiety coming from the sense that my life is passing me by. I ultimately had a panic attack so bad today that I couldn't tell if it was a stroke and had somebody drive me to go get medical care.

It's not hard to tell how I got here. I had my first date in over a year last week and it ended kind of lukewarm. My job, I'm spinning my wheels, I'm good enough to be really bored but it's too early to reasonably leave. I had a better compensated job basically offered to me but couldn't take it because it was too soon, so it was very stressful to say no.

But so much good stuff happened this week - I can't even believe it was one freaking week.

I was at a small punk rock show and one of my favorite singers showed up to listen to the band. I'd never seen him in person, it would've been on my bucket list when I was a teen. He jumped in the mosh pit and I caught him at one point. Another of my favorites singers was there too and was right next to me most of the show. I traded info with somebody who is putting out an album and am even getting a signed copy from one of their side projects.

I got that job offer and it came basically because a bunch of people who screwed me over on my last job ended up in trouble and the downwind led to someone leaving at the worst time. They needed someone fast. An executive who I haven't talked to in almost a year and only met me once *called me first.* I stuck out as good to him that strongly. I've never felt that competent before, I usually feel like I'm last choice in anything - and that guy could still help me make my career one day, in a different situation.

And for the first time, I feel like I have choices in my career, even though I'm still far from having ""made it."" My current job is good enough and accomplishing things for my professional reputation. It's the first time I haven't felt like I have to immediately take anything else that comes along, to make slightly more money.

They did an EKG on me and told me that my heart was normal. This is actually extremely good news because I haven't done any check-ups since getting sober (had one scheduled coming up) and I have a family history of heart defects. Will still check it out but there was a reason I was anxious about possible sudden death and it looks like that's not where my health actually is. I'm actually looking like I'm ok-ish.",4

Sometimes we go out to a bar or two after and on occasion we might go out clubbing after the bars and have a big night out. It's an easy progression from the office to the clubs sometimes.

I've had lots of fun times at these little get togethers and it's really strengthened my relationships with others in the office that I don't directly work with. But if I reflect, it wasn't just because of drinking that I enjoyed myself but more of being in good company of others.

First time poster, long time member of the subreddit. I haven't had the confidence to post until now. Three weeks ago I decided that enough was enough, and I checked myself into rehab. At that point I was drinking a bottle of Vodka a day, and while trying to detox on my own, the withdrawals were horrific. 

I've been drinking for 5 years now. I've attempted in-patient detox twice (this being the third) but until now I've never done it for me. I've done it because I've been found out and it's the 'right' thing to do. This time, it's for me. My life was a nightmare - I was in my first year of full time work, commuting, and still drinking. I don't know how I even managed to get up in the mornings. 

I've had plenty of day ones - where I was done with alcohol and wouldn't touch it again - but by day two I was 'rewarding' myself with a drink for making it through that day. I know how twisted that sounds. 

I am now very proud to announce that I am 17 days sober. I never thought it would be possible. The 'I am Sober' app has calculated that in that 17 days, I have saved $510! I go home on Monday (so two more days in rehab), and it's safe to say I'm crapping my pants. I'm terrified of messing up again, of slipping and relapsing. Most of all I'm terrified that my whole life will always be stuck revolving around alcohol. 

I'm done passing out on the toilet and waking up on the bathroom floor. I'm done with the red eyes, the withdrawals at work, with everyone asking me what's wrong. I'm sick of the shame, the mental energy of plotting and planning my next drink. 

So I am very proud to join this community and say, finally, I WILL NOT DRINK WITH YOU TODAY!",28

Man, I had a shit day at work. Got handed a crap project and dealt with some dumbass processes that management handed down that make no sense. You know how it goes. Stupid work, amiright?

Anyway, I work from home and used to go to the bar pretty much every day after logging off to get drunk and get some social time time in. I very, very rarely think about drinking anymore, but honestly after I was done today, a very fleeting thought crossed my mind that would it be fucking fabulous to go to the bar, get obliterated, and kvetch about my job.

It passed quickly, but I needed to get out of the house and do something. So I walked passed several bars in my neighborhood and went a cute local boutique instead. They had an adorable dress in the window the other day, and I knew I wanted it. I got there, and found they had one left in my size! It fit love a glove and looks super cute so I bought it. Also, it has pockets! The ladies will know what a score that is, and dudes, well, just so you know, a dress that has pockets is a good dress indeed.

It wasn’t cheap, but thanks to not drinking for more than 2 years, I have a good chunk of money saved, and I haven’t already blown my whole paycheck on alcohol so I could easily afford it. I’m so very thankful for that.

I also had a moment yesterday when I decided to get a pedicure after work. The place I go to is right next to my local liquor store (just a few blocks away from my house) and it was odd sitting there, waiting for my nails to dry, watching everyone go in and out, getting booze for their Wednesday night. So many people! I was so happy that isn’t me anymore, and was very content, sitting there with my new pretty pedicure, that I paid for with the money I’ve saved by not drinking. It was a Very Good Feeling and I was very thankful. 

Anyone else out there engage in some retail therapy when you’re feeling like you want to drink or just want to treat yourself for being so fucking awesome? What have you done to Treat Yo Self lately?

I hope everyone is have an excellent night. And if you're having a rough one, hang in there -- you got this! It gets so much easier, I promise.

I decided early today that I was going to start my sober journey. I've taken breaks here and there, 2 days, 4 days. Stopped hard liquor, switched to lighter beers, but never really committed. I had not decided until 4 hours ago to tell my wife. I was conflicted in revealing the guilt and shame, disclosing the hiding spots, snuck drinks and horrible choices. I didn't want the stress of talking to her presenting more stress on our marriage but decided most damage was done and her thinking I wasnt serious was worse. 

I'm 99% sure that I made the right call but feel the lowest low in a long time. The shame and guilt weigh heavy and shes the most important thing to me and I feel horrible about what shes put up with for the last 15 years.

I am trying to turn the thing on its head this time- that is, look to the benefits of an AF life, rather than just focus on completing a dry stretch before returning to normal.

Daily pledges and reflections are helping, as are various forms of peer support, including here.

I think I do feel a bit different this time - am certainly not calculating when/how/where I can have my next drink (at least at the moment).

I don’t miss the energy devoted to that sort of thinking and the dishonest sort of dirty feeling that accompanies.

I don’t miss the feeling of crushing inevitability that I would exceed any limit I tried to set while sober.

I don’t miss the panic, fear and disempowerment of waking up after a night on the turps - the racing questions of how and whether a binge could be concealed from those close to me.

Loads of ongoing work, of course- part of this will be to retain the realities of my drinking patterns with me so that a ‘quiet drink’ somewhere doesn’t creep back into mind as an attractive option down the track.",6

I never thought about suicide or harming myself, but I suppose drinking myself into oblivion is pretty much harming myself. For the most part, I averaged two 1.75 liters (a handle?) of vodka a week and I'm a 5'6 130lb female. Or was anyways. 

So when I ""quit"" drinking, I was really worried about temptation. My roommate keeps beers around constantly but I'm not really a beer drinker so it's not that bad. Even if I drink beer, I could only have 2 or 3 at most, which to me isn't much. But thats probably the alcoholic part of me speaking. I decided I would not buy any more vodka and try to resist any sort of alcohol temptation. But of course, during that first week, without my poison of choice, those beers tempted me. I'm ashamed to admit I did drink maybe 1 a day, but that was it and I felt very guilty when I did. And I realized if I wasn't getting super drunk, that 1 beer wasn't even worth it. So I quit doing that after the second day. Even though I still drank a little bit, I knew it was a lot better than me downing 1/3rd of a handle of vodka like I normally would. 

Little by little, everyday I woke up feeling a little better, a little more clear and more energetic, a little more motivated to do things. Today, I looked in the mirror and noticed how nice my skin looked and that was a major confidence boost and incentive to keep it up because my skin was looking dull and washed out from all the drinking before. Also, I haven't been smoking as when I drink I always crave cigarettes. With my renewed energy, I decided I was going to try to detox, eat better, and try to lose my alcohol weight. I bought a scale the other day and was absolutely shocked to see I am at 150lbs now. I don't feel like I've gained that much weight but I guess I have. Mostly in my belly. I'm going to try really hard to lose that weight now. Last Saturday was my friends birthday dinner and I hadn't seen all of them in a really long time. He wanted to do a group birthday shot which I obliged but I felt a little guilty. But I didn't drink anything after. And since then, I haven't drank anything at all.

I'm wondering.. for everyone who has quit drinking, does 1 small drink followed by not drinking any extra count as a relapse? As in, I should reset my flair? I'd like to think it isn't but I suppose ""cheating"" is cheating. I guess technically I have since I did have a drink, but deep down I don't feel like I relapsed or fucked up too much because I resisted drinking any more. How do you guys deal with that?",3

I’ve finally come to a point where I’ve realised that if I don’t quite have a problem yet, I’m about to. 7500 calories each week I don’t need - that’s three full days of food I’m drinking.

3 or 4 times a week, I’m regularly drinking 6 or more pints a night. Once I start, I don’t stop until I’m the last man standing, then I head home.

I’m always tired, always anxious about work. I get in late, stay late, then start the drinking to celebrate the day being done. It used to be fun, but now it’s just lubricant for the rut I’m in.

I’m posting here to mark the day - I’m going to try not to drink for a month to start. Today’s payday, and we’d usually get on the piss tonight. Normally it’s me trying to rally the crowd to head to the pub - tonight I’m going to try to say no and go home. I’m afraid I don’t know how anymore.

I truly feel crazy, or lost, or like I’m playing some sort of game at life, but I don’t know all the rules and I am blindfolded.
I finally got the courage last week to go see a doctor.   He gave me medication – it’s all in French so I don’t know the names, but basically lots of vitamins, Xanax, and a pill that he says will make me lose the urge to drink. He also gave me some sleeping pills, which I took one time, and didn’t wake up until one the next day – so those are done for me.
I had my first drink at 14, and it felt like coming home. I thought that was how it was supposed to make you feel. Pretty normal drinking through college, and less and less normal as the years passed.
I lost my sister at 24 to alcoholism. Well actually, it was suicide, after she was the victim of a violent attack, that happened while she was so drunk she couldn’t function. It took her six months to kill herself, but she managed to do it with a combination of vodka and a shit ton of Tylenol p.m. I was 27.
I am 43 now. I have two beautiful children, a great husband, a rather kick ass job, and there’s just something sitting inside me that must hate me – because I wouldn’t wish the way I feel or the way I’m living my life on my worst enemy.
I’ve been lurking on this Site for over a year.
Last October, my grandmother was crossing the street to get her mail and was struck and killed by a car – driver was texting. I think things got really bad after that – not that they were good before – but looking back that’s when I went from a bottle of wine a night to up to a liter of vodka a night.
I just did blood results, and my AST, ALT, and GGT are through the roof -GGT is 297.
I’ve been seeing the doctor every day this week – he’s keeping tabs on me. The first couple days were rough. And today was rough. And I think tomorrow will be rough. I do feel that the medication is helping me -the Xanax at least is keeping me calm, or numb, or whatever.
I am just so pessimistic about this. I don’t think there’s anyway I can keep this up.
So I guess this makes it day 4 for me.

I'm not sure how I got to this point. 

I feel like it's been a long time coming. I quit almost completely during the spring/summer last year and somehow got right back to it. I lost a lot of weight and was feeling pretty good. Now I've developed high blood pressure and diabetes. And I know I'm going to end up with more liver problems combining those medications and alcohol so I've just got to stop before I get there.

I've basically been drinking too much since my 21st birthday. During undergrad years, it was mostly partying on the weekend. In grad school, I arranged my class and work schedules to allow partying Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. Sundays were generally light drinking while trying to rejoin the world of the living. At 24, I got married. At 25, I finished school and got my first ""real job"". My drinking progressed to be almost every night. For the past few years, I have been going through a wine box every couple of days or so. Some nights I drink the entire box (4 bottles of wine), and then I feel awful the next day. Luckily, I can work remotely, so I spend many hungover days in my bedroom recliner, trying to keep up with email and conference calls. I'm 90 lb overweight (6ft, 275 lb). At my last physical, my liver numbers were slightly elevated. I convinced myself that they are reverse of alcoholic fatty liver, so I just have normal fatty liver (like it's a good thing), which was sufficient rationalization to continue drinking. My family deserves the best husband, father, son, and friend that I can be. I'm certainly not giving them that thus far. I want to get my fitness back before I'm too old and sick to turn this thing around. I don't know if I will ever quit drinking completely. I enjoy an evening glass of wine with my wife, and I'm confident that I can moderate. But for now, let's go completely sober for a while, reset my body, and hopefully get the ball rolling on some weight loss.",9

I was anxious, scared, but optimistic. The first few days were tough. I had to adjust to living in a room with 7 other men, adhering to a strict routine, and confronting myself. At first I hated it. The schedule. The classes. Living soberly. Eventually, I adjusted. Alone with my thoughts, I was truly able to reflect and process what had brought me to that moment. I couldn't run, or escape, and I was glad. 

When I exited, I was terrified. I was no longer tucked away and safe. I was in the real world again where my vices and insecurities were able to persuade me to use. I admit, outside of work and meetings, I retreated to my apartment. I didn't trust myself yet. After all, my best thinking got me to where I was. In a meeting, one older gentleman said: ""You can't be afraid to live life. Yeah, you're an alcoholic, but being scared and hiding isn't the way to go."" That really stuck with me. 

106 days sober, not everything gets easier, but it does become more manageable. Stressors that I used as an excuse to drink aren't persuasive and I can dismiss them. What used to be boredom is now a calm that I enjoy. My wife and I are still separated, our marriage still in limbo, but we're communicating again. Work is mundane, but I find joy in seeing my coworkers suffer along with me (/s). I've made more effort to spend time with family. Honestly, there's nothing really I can complain about. 

All in all, I wouldn't change anything. My past brought me to where I am and taught me to truly value and prioritize my sobriety. My alcoholism will never go away, but it no longer has control of my life. For those still struggling, it gets better. Each relapse isn't a failure, but a learning moment and no reason to quit. I'm worth it. You're worth it. We're worth it. We deserve to be happy. By right of birth, be deserve to experience joy. Not everyday will be full of sunshine, but that's real life. We experience sadness, regret, and misery in order to appreciate the good that does arrive.

After over a year of lurking here, and also after reading This Naked Mind (from all the glowing recommendations here) I finally have come to the point of truly not wanting the consequences that alcohol creates. My physical and mental health have both been steadily deteriorating over the past few years and I've known the longer I wait to turn things around, the harder it will be. So I decided 2020 was my year to kick this habit/dependence and make better decisions for my future. I'm no good at day 1's but something recently clicked for me in terms of percentages. So far I've been sober for 67% of this year. Not great, but compared to my 6% sobriety in 2019, I'm on fire! So that brings me to this most recent achievement that I'm so very proud of. I play a silly mobile game called MyVegas and last year I was able to turn some make believe game points into 3 free nights at The Mirage. At the time I booked this vacation I didn't bat an eyelash at the atmosphere, foolishly looking forward to a 5 day/4 night vacation of debauchery. Of course being presently focused on my sobriety, I was a bit apprehensive about how this would go. But here I sit in McCarran airport, awaiting my return flight home, and I'm happy to report that not a drop of alcohol was had on this vacation. This is the first sober vacation of my adult life and I am just so damn proud of myself. I had an amazing time AND I remember all the moments that made it amazing. I didn't waste a single second being hungover or dehydrated and I realized how much energy I used to spend on alcohol - figuring out where to buy it, who had it for cheap, spending money buying it, spending time lugging it around (and that's not even counting how much water I had to buy/carry/drink to counteract the ravages of alcohol). All that time and energy and money I got to reinvest in ME and my MEMORIES this time around. IWNDWYT

Since I make the rules, I'm celebrating anyway. Here are some of the things I am reflecting on today - it's not all joy and wonder.","The day before Valentine's Day last year, I got a few beers into a six-pack, and decided I was done. I was purely drinking out of misplaced nostalgia at that point - it was doing nothing positive for me. I quit. 

Now that some time has elapsed, I've spent a lot of time reflecting on what has what has changed, positive and negative. These aren't the bright, colorful revelations that some post about after quitting. The ""best decision I ever made"" just hasn't been my experience. Maybe, though, these ruminations resonate with some for whom is isn't all coming up roses.  

&#x200B;

\- I was anxious and depressed (not diagnosed or anything, but the shoe fits) before I quit, now I'm anxious and depressed, just less. The highs and lows are attenuated, so it's much more manageable, but I'm certainly not in a state of bliss or even happy. I do think there's value in confronting this without the influence of drinking.

\- I discovered that the real me is not a social person. I wasn't actually a ""social drinker""; I used social situations as a license to drink. Without the promise of alcohol, my desire to be around people socially has gone to basically zero. I'm discussing this in therapy. 

\- While I have many regrets from my drinking career, I do acknowledge that some good things such as meeting my future wife (\~10 years ago) wouldn't have happened without it. It's a little tough to reconcile this with the generally positive motivators for quitting. I suppose if it was all bad, nobody would do it. 

\- I never quite relax these days. I think I always have a nagging voice that is telling me I have things to do, that I should be doing this or that. I used to silence that with alcohol, and it seems clear this was a big part of why I became dependent on it. 

\- The veil really gets lifted on how present alcohol is in culture and how much the media urges us to drink, and drink more. It's portrayed as something that makes characters charismatic, brave, skilled, brooding and complex. I really noticed how often characters on TV drink. Even when drinking has nothing to do with a scene, there's wine or beer around as set dressing at all times. It's totally normal, or at least we are urged to believe it is. 

\- I don't see my friends much anymore. This is probably a combination of factors but sobriety and the fact that I have a new baby make me party poison. Not that my friends party much anymore, we are getting old. I'm basically alright with this.

&#x200B;

The tone of these items may be negative, but I could write volumes on the positives. I'm grappling with some of this stuff, but it doesn't come close to making me want to start again.

The largest effect of quitting, to paraphrase another stopdrinking poster, is that my ""bad luck"" ran out. The subtle combination of lousy reputation, lack of motivation, public embarrassments and poor self esteem that alcohol helped me accumulate manifested in a long run of bad fortune. That has started to turn around, but Rome wasn't built in a day.

I've made up my mind and I'm going to do it … in a month :)  The more it sinks in the more my insistence that I must wait a month is turning into wishing that I could go right away … but that would be so disruptive to my career and family that it would do more harm than good.   

I'm very excited.  I've needed to put down the booze for a long time.  It's killing my insides, and I only drink beer lately.  It's destroying my brain.  

In the meantime, I'm trying to keep it at a minimal effective dose, so to speak.  I know it's not ideal to have 4 to 6 beers a day, but all my efforts to quit have been futile.  I've done a good job with harm reduction already …  (mostly due to my need to be sneaky with it) … I've weaned myself down to this level from much higher alcohol beverages … and I can't imagine doing anything particularly dangerous or stupid, or ramping back up to scary levels in the next month.    

Now I just hope this month flies by, because I can't wait for my body to start to heal.  

Getting all my work projects wrapped up in the next month is going to be  little tricky, but I can't believe how motivated I am by the thought of being locked away from alcohol for a couple weeks, and getting my right mind back.

The thought of having counseling and medication as needed and some quiet, away space … all in one place … it's is beginning to sound idyllic to a busy, divorced working mom like me.  I really can't wait.",7

Last week I created a post that I was 'about' to stop. I did it and the counter is now on 7 days.

Before I had +- 4 years of drinking every day up until about 50 units a week. I was still able to work and enjoy some quality in life, but I was living on the edge and knew it.

I expected a lot of cravings and was not wrong about that. I still have some beers lurking to me in the closet and some tubes of whiskey I got as a present. They called me a few times, please drink me... its ok, just one... no one needs to know. But I told them to piss off and ignored it, even while it was really hard.

The first few nights I had trouble sleeping and the first mornings felt like a bad hangover. Now after a few days I feel the energy coming back, I am more productive at work and enjoy life a bit more.

Up to the next 3 weeks, promised myself at least a month!

I've been trying to stop drinking for some time now. This sub has helped me realize that even tapering my drinking is still an accomplishment in itself, and even if I fail at all out quitting, it's still a step in the right direction. Yesterday, I was feeling pretty good in my sobriety. I had a productive day, my kids were being super cute and loving, and I felt pride in my ability to provide for my family. These are feelings that are dampened by alcohol. I got the usual urge to stop by the liquor store and grab a bottle, and I almost did. But instead I looked up to one of the prominent mountains that surround Salt Lake City, the mountain that I grew up in the shadow of, one that I'd climbed to the top of numerous times, and it gave me strength. That wild piece of geography that was once a sea bed, and forced thousands of feet skyward by ancient tectonic forces, stood like a beacon of undepletable strength; a strength that I could draw upon if only I'd stop poisoning myself. ""I am a mountain"" I thought to myself. I have within me the ability to accomplish fantastic things. 

I won't promise to myself that I will never have a drop of alcohol again, because that probably isn't true, and being realistic about your weaknesses is part of being strong. But, I drove past the liquor store yesterday with senses heightened by my reverie, and this morning I rose early, clear headed, and watched the sun rise over that mountain, and I found the same solace it gave me yesterday.",17

I am 26, live in Los Angeles and I am a daily drinker. I have been drinking daily for almost four years now. At first, I was not concerned (although I should have been) and I lived my life somewhat happily. I started drinking more heavily at the age of 19 when I was sexually assaulted at gunpoint. It was and is a terrible coping mechanism. As the years have progressed the drinking has only ramped up. I am sober right now as I type but only because I have been up since 3 am (I wake up at this time almost daily) and am too embarrassed to head to the store this early. I have been stressed out about my drinking for about two years now. But it really started affecting me when five months ago my aunt died, we were very close- only nine years apart and were best friends. She died from an accidental overdose. She struggled with alcohol, we lived on opposite sides of the country for the last few years so we did not drink together. I so desperately want to get help but I don't know where to start. I am very poor and don't have health insurance at the moment. I can not tell my mom- like I said her baby sister died from this so recently. I don't feel ready to go to an AA meeting, plus I dont believe in God. I don't really know what the point of this post is. I guess just to have somebody listen.

2020-02-13 10:29:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f3blqe/100_days/,100 days,"First time poster, long time lurker. First off, way before I hit 100 days, Beer had a hold of me. I tried to quit, but some how someway, a bottle of IPA was in my hand by 5. Stringing along even just two sober days was damn near impossible. My energy was always down in the dumps and I was the walking dead mentally. I just wanted a release from life and it's stresses. Once the hops and suds entered, I turned into a belligerent, short tempered husband instead of the boyfriend my wife met all those years ago. I was there physically, but that was about it. I didn't have life because I was knocked out on the couch by 8pm, only to wake up at 2am drenched in sweat and my heart beating outta my chest. I was a heartbeat or two away from a cardiac arrest. I'd swear off the booze and curse myself for falling into the trap once more. Never again I promised. I knew that I would die young if I continued on this path. I'd bumble through the fog and the haze. Forget stuff. Feel stupid. Get irritated at small things. I felt like I needed a break from all that, so I drank. I'll quit tomorrow, so let's make tonight count. This went on for years. Drink, almost die, swear to change, hangover, craving, repeat. 

Beer had such a grip on me that I saw giving up IPAs was worse than dying and I was OK with that fact. I wasn't proud that I was going to leave my wife and new born early, but I just couldn't figure this shit out.

What snapped in me was the embarrassment and shame when I came clean with my wife. She knew I had a problem, but didn't know to what extent. I squirrelled away bottles literally like nobody's business. I would play hide and drink on our drinking nights, which coincidentally turned into most nights. She thought I was 'only having 2 tonight' but let's be real here. 

After countless times of trying to get sober, something finally clicked. No more would I waste my money, health and most importantly my time. These 100 days represent the life I regained from the insidious clown we call alcohol. No more will I have to relive all of that which I described. I had to white knuckle it early on. Hell, even just the thought of beer used to set me off. Nowadays I am repulsed and saddened by it. The sight of alcohol represents the +10 years I've lost. I'm healthier, sharp as tac and I'm making better decisions in life. I won't get back the lost time, but at least I have control of what time I have left.

I felt really horrible and ended up lying to myself about the whole thing. I thought I could just sweep it under the rug and everything would be fine. I continued on. I've had some more significant slips since then and owned up to (let my sponsor know and collected a different chip at my home group), but ever since then I have felt like a failure.

Well, yesterday I was out grocery shopping with a girl I've been seeing, we were planning on having some friends over so in accordance, I grabbed a 6 pack of beer that I knew one of the people coming liked, or at least that was the sentiment. This girl knows I haven't been drinking but didn't know my history with drinking, which is something I should be talking to her about, but I digress.

Night of the get together, one person cancels, then another, so we decided we'd wait to have it another night when we could all be there, my girlfriend took the opportunity to get caught up on some sleep so she took off. so I'm sitting in my house, bummed that my big plans fell completely apart and with nothing to do and a 6 pack in my fridge. I would go to the fridge and just open it up and rummage around to almost prove to myself that I could resist. I grabbed one of my NA beers and retired to the couch. After some time I went back to get another and there the beers were, almost staring me in the face as soon as I opened the door.

I made a dumb decision, I grabbed one, popped it open and took a gulp of it. The taste was NOT what I was so fondly remembering, I stood there feeling absolutely disgusted with myself that I even did this, I poured the rest promptly down the drain, grabbed the rest of the beer, shamefully walked all the way out to the back of my backyard and poured them all out, 1 by one, bagged them up and into the recycling bin they went. I called my friend who's on this journey with me and told him what happened, he told me he was proud of me for not finishing it, or going back for another or slamming all 6, for that matter. I took that as a lesson learned of just how powerful the drink can be over a person. I plan on telling my girlfriend about my alcoholism and how I'm working to defeat it. She doesn't drink hardly ever but I'm not sure how she will take it. I just know I need to be honest to myself and to everyone in my life to keep myself accountable.

2020-02-13 08:03:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f39o0p/i_like_the_new_sober_me/,I like the new sober me.,"I have been reinventing myself this year. First, with my new-found sobriety. This is a huge accomplishment for me. Second, with the habits I would like to implement. I have a lofty list of new goals I’d like to achieve this year. It's almost like I am building a new person.

I have recently started a 5:30 am morning routine. If you had told me even a year ago that I would be waking up that early *on purpose*, I would’ve called you crazy, laughed, and popped open a bottle of wine and repeated a painful process. These days waking up like this makes the most sense to me. It is what I *want.* What I crave.

I’ve decided to stop listening to the stories I tell myself and start listening to what my body wants. I used to work with a woman at a local restaurant who was a preschool teacher. She would wake up around 5:00 am every single day. She would go for a jog, do her laundry, and empty the dishwasher. To me, this seemed impossible. I had every excuse in the book for why this couldn’t be me. I was not a “morning” person, I needed tons of sleep, I was a night owl, I *hated* mornings, etc.

Yet deep down, a part of me was jealous. I wanted her schedule. I admired it. I wanted to be able to wake up early and have solitude, time for an energized run, to be able to journal my thoughts, and to have a sacred few minutes with a piping hot cup of coffee. Before sobriety, I would’ve been too hungover on a consistent basis.

But now that I have found the magic of being sober, I have just started doing it.

This year, I want to do many things that I told myself just aren’t for me. I want to change the script. Here are some initial thoughts:

* There is a trail in the woods near my house that I visit almost daily in the summer. For the rest of the winter, I want to take frequent walks through it. Even in the snow and cold. I used to tell myself I hated winter. Sober me has decided she loves winter and will do all sorts of outdoor activities. I believe this will keep me sane.
* In the summer, I want energized runs in the morning around the above-mentioned trail.
* I want to consistently wake up at 5:00 am and go to sleep by 9:00 pm every single day.
* I want to pick up a second job as a waitress at my favorite restaurant to save for my future. The best part: they close at 9:00 pm, so as long as I am not closing I should be able to stick with my routine.
* My fiance and I are selling our condo and plan on living with his parents for a few months. A year ago I would’ve told myself that was impossible. But now, I embrace the possibility. Saving money sounds awesome! Lucky us.
* I am going to have enthusiasm and joy for my job, even though it is probably not something I will do forever. The drinking-version of me would throw myself a pity party every day.

I used to tell myself a girls night wouldn’t be complete without a bottle of wine. The next morning, I would be writhing in agony and guilt for how much I had consumed. This year, I will be attending *my own* Bachelorette Party and intend to remain sober. There will be many girls nights up until then and I will rock them with seltzer in hand.

Sobriety has given me a new sense of self. It has opened up the possibilities for a new and better version of myself. If I had been drinking consistently this year, there is no way I would’ve been able to write these words. I am grateful I took the leap. I am overwhelmingly excited about what this year will bring.

Five months of travel has come to an end. I am typing this at the airport.

The adventure fades into the past and becomes a memory. A moment that may never have happened. The world seems a little darker and the future less titillating. I wander through duty-free trying to forget about the tears that are amassing behind my eyes. Each tear a memory. A celebration of an achievement that was never expected. I notice I am in the hard liquor aisle, by coincidence, I didn’t wander here like some sort of alcoholic homing pigeon. The bottles seem blank and lifeless. They no longer offer a solution to my current plight. I am at the lowest I have been for years but this isn’t depression. This is the comedown from the greatest time in my life. I want it back. I want those five months of travel back. I want them again. I want to relive each day again. I never said that whilst drinking. I drank to escape each day. I pause for a minute and look at the bottles. There is nothing here for me here. There is no longing. No yearning. It’s like looking at a photo of an ex-girlfriend who I know reconciling with would only end in disaster. The solution resides inside me. I have to accept, regroup and go again. To where? I don’t know.

The tears won’t leave. My emotions are discombobulated. A mixture of joy, sadness and loneliness. Joy at being able to see it through and achieve what I never thought possible. Sadness at it being over. And loneliness from the people I met and left behind.

I don’t know what I am going to do. I am unsure for the first time in years because I no longer have a plan. I am not worried about the lack of direction. I am encouraged by the freedom I still have thanks to not drinking. The freedom to draft up another plan and set more goals.

I just never expected to be at this point.

My focus was first on stopping drinking and then on reaping the benefits of sobriety. I am at the end of that road. The dreams I drafted out on a scrap of paper and hung next to my desk as a reminder are now complete. I never expected to say that. Those words should belong to someone else, not me. Not the man who gave himself no chance. But they do and on reflection, it was easier than I thought it would be. At the time, the change seemed hard. The changes I wanted to make seemed like trying to turn the titanic the second before impact. That's why I broke them down and gave no deadline. I didn’t want pressure I wanted to change and was prepared to wait for it to happen. I had the belief it would turn out okay and thankfully it did.

My flight is boarding so I fight the tears and make my way home. 

The UK is in the grip of winter. The cold seeps into my bones as reality seeps into my mind. I have no plan, no crosses to bear. I have given what was owed to the alcoholic me, a life beyond my wildest dreams. I achieved what I could never have done back then and feel proud to have done so. Yet, on my return, I feel a sense of emptiness like something is missing. I notice that I browse shopping websites for something to buy. Like an item will fill the void. Maybe it will for a short time but it seems like a series of short term fixes for a long time. But there is no void. There is no perfect item to make me complete. I already am enough. It all resides within. There is beauty in everyone.

People will wrongly assume that my “hippie” outlook can be attributed to the travel but it is due to the work I did on myself in sobriety. The meditation, yoga and the books I read played a part. I had to release the nonsense that used to twist my mind into a knot. The world problems that I had adopted yet had no chance of changing. I was killing myself with worry. I had to learn to pick my battles wisely and focus on myself for a little while. I had to stop and smell the roses every now and then. Embrace the simple beauty in life and celebrate being alive. Not weighed down with pointless guilt and worry.

I know my purpose. I just have no idea how to make it happen, yet. I climbed off a barstool, paid back what I owed and achieved my dreams. It is time to pay it forward. To demonstrate the way. To help others achieve what they thought they never would. To help others find the strength to find the answers. How this takes place I am not sure yet. I will keep writing blogs in the hope that someone gets something from them but in the long run, I will need to be more involved. I want to do this because I once thought that the cyclic mundanity that was my life was life. I thought the self-loathing negativity was normality. I thought that it was my destiny to live like that. I sit here today knowing that nothing is further from the truth. The world I thought existed was a mirage. An illusion that I had created to keep me from trying.

It took courage at the start. “The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.” That step was saying “I’ve had enough. I have a problem. I want to change” I had to say it. No one could say it for me. I had to say it. I had to believe it and I had to mean it. I spent years lying to myself and that had got me nowhere. It was time to get honest with myself and then the world. Of course, it was scary but the fear was just a barrier I had created to stop me changing.

At first, I just stopped drinking. Nothing more. I just focused on not drinking.

Once, the alcohol had left my system, it had left my life. There was a temptation. A craving to escape. To scratch the itch but I knew where it would take me and I was tired of being in that place. I was then left with a void of time and loneliness. As I had consumed alcohol it had consumed my time and my emotions. Now I had time to fill. I believe if this time isn’t filled then boredom creeps in and then alcohol makes it’s way back into my life. Sobriety is the time to achieve the things that were once unachievable. To be the person who I deserved to be. So i dusted off the dreams and brought them into the light. It is time to believe in myself. It is time to reward muself for making the change. Not be punished for the decision. It seemed like I was missing out on life at the start. My friends would be out drinking and having a “good time”. I would be at home drawing a comparison and questioning my decisions. But over time I began to see the rewards of not drinking; financially, physically and mentally. It was hard to not fall back into the old routine but that is why it is so important to replace the old habits with new healthier ones. I read books on confidence, self-help and personal growth. All things I would have laughed at previously but I wanted to change and I had to be prepared to change to make it happen. I don’t know why I believed that it would be better. I guess I just thought that being sober couldn’t be any worse. I had blamed everything and everyone for my problems. Everyone, accept me and everything, accept alcohol that is. So it was the only thing left to try. I’m glad I realised before it was too late.

- First off, I'm well over a year sober!!!
- I did a year of intensive therapy with a psychologist and came out with a much better understanding of the origins of my struggles, triggers for my bad behavior, etc.
-I started eating even better and exercising more, and dropped another 40 pounds (a total of 70 pounds in 2 years)!
- I repaired 99% of my relationships. What's left are those people who are still living toxic lives that I can't be a part of.
- I started dating again! Had a couple of false starts, but now I've been dating the love of my life for about 6 months, and I've never been happier or more certain of someone than I am now.
- I gained 20 pounds back (see the above note for why, haha), and now I'm working on getting back to a decent weight while still enjoying the food I love. 
- To that end, I started playing racquetball at the Y, and got back into yoga.
- I stopped meditating, but really want to start giving it more of an effort.
- Friends and family have come to me asking for help and advice with their own struggles with alcohol, or how to help a loved one.

Even though I'm still a flawed human, I feel so much better about myself, my decisions, and just everything that's been going on. If you're near the beginning of this journey, please please PLEASE trust the process, and know that you're on an amazing path. even if you stumble a few times, just dust yourself off and stick with it. And because you're here, you have a fantastic community to support you! Keep at it y'all. 

Let me know if you have any questions, or just need someone to listen. 

I will not drink with you today!!!",47

On and off all day, yes, no, please don’t, but I want to. Do I have enough time to stop at the store, drink a bit and cover it up before my husband gets home.  Even in yoga classes, while I feel the benefits of the energy generated, the peace and calm and strength, my mind would be quietly arguing, planning, talking me into drinking later after work. Enough already. I said no, and that’s final. 

I dreamt last night I drank. Just one drink. I can’t remember what it was, or what the circumstances except that I was alone. What I do remember is the conflict afterwards. Do I sneak? Do I reset the counter of sober days back to one or do I lie? When I woke up it took a few minutes to know it wasn’t real, I didn’t drink, I don’t have to have that conversation with myself. I was so relieved.

We went out for dinner last night and my parents each had a drink. My mom offered me a taste of hers and I knew I can’t, it won’t taste good but it will trigger me. This was my first time being around alcohol since I quit. Snapper Jack’s, a typical beach restaurant with a huge bar in the middle of the room and signs promoting various types of alcohol on the walls. I wasn’t interested. Yay for me.",12

The 12th of Jan this year is when I got out of rehab and yesterday marked a month in ""the real world"" sober and clean. Its a milestone / personal best as I've never managed any more than three weeks in any attempt prior.

There were cycles of shame/guilt/depression and there were a couple times for a split second i was tempted, but despite a helpless financial and personal situation I've somehow survived. 
What kept me from doing so would be support from friends and family, some good playlists(music), sport, meditation and writing alot of journals which really helped to get in touch with / process my feelings and emotions. Also, a new perspective on spirituality changed some aspects. 

To top that off I was approached by someone (acquaintance/friend) who reached out to me for a chat. He had been contemplating to get help for a long time but didn't know how to, in a community that doesn't approve of rehabs and therapists. Hearing my story nudged him to go see a therapist and he finally gathered the courage to share with me and get contact details from me for further help if needed. I hope he follows through and wish him all the best. 
I should say it felt nice / a little useful to be able to help, in any little way possible.

I'm a guy who likes to put a positive spin on anything but today, no, this is awful right now. It's been about three weeks since my last drink, I know I need to push through, if it was this easy addiction would be an empty word.

Any helping ideas for someone who breezed through the first few weeks and feeling it hard now? I can rationalise my sobriety in a thousand different ways, but biology won't listen to reason!

I’ve managed to achieve a few small things in my short time sober, I did laundry for the first time in a month, I emptied all the nasty out of date stuff from my fridge, I cleaned the bathroom. All very normal things for someone in control. All things drunk me really didn’t care about.

Yesterday was a real struggle, but I didn’t drink, I managed my stress with better methods. I’m finding calming music helps change my way of thinking. And stops my mind racing.

Today I’m going to go to a supermarket and buy some fresh food and cook myself a meal, normal, right? I haven’t done that in months. And I love to cook!

I drank the subsequent weekend, sharing a bottle of wine on the Saturday night with my wife, had a mild headache on the Sunday, the following Saturday I had 4-5 pints of beer again had a mini hangover. 

Although not abstinent I’m pleased that I’m limiting and it really feels like my relationship with drink is changing for the better. (My friends don’t get it and I’ve received some abuse in our text group), however it’s only motivated me that I’m on the right path. 

We are visiting friends this weekend, normally I take 8-12 cans of lager for the visit (per night). I’ve bought 4, and not really that fussed on drinking them. 

Just hoping everyone can stick to their plans this weekend, be it full on sobriety or reduction. If anyone fails try not to be too down.",2

I have been doing the sobriety thing for a while now (wow time flies) and im feeling fairly good about it. Of course I know thats when it gets you, so im trying to refrain from anything approaching cocky. 

At the end of the week im going away to an all-inclusive resort on vacation with family. Of course this means free flowing and readily available alcohol absolutely everywhere; last time i went to this place there was a full bar of beer and hard liquor in each room. Prior trips, I drank like a fish. 

This will likely be one of the biggest challenges I have faced yet; I know that a lot of things that trigger me will be present and it would be a ""great"" time to slip. I will hold strong though. Or at least I hope!

I have plans. Everyone im going with knows about my issues so thats a huge help that I am able to be open. I also have a breathalyzer (if you dont have one GET ONE! its a great tool and also fun at parties for the folks who do drink. They are affordable for decent ones!) which I love because scheduling tests before bed/other times where my wife watches has helped immensely in the past and will likely do so again. Im much less likely to do something stupid if I know for a fact ill be caught and shit will hit the fan. 

Im not really worried about this trip, although of course that makes me worried lol. Not sure the point of this post, except that writing it makes me feel better and hopefully will help with the whole experience. Wish me luck, it will be a week away, and ill try and remember to check back in with updates after I get back.

That is what my boss is pissed about. 

My staff got me out of jail. My parents were more concerned with getting their car I've been using out of impound. Which they did, but were gonna leave me in jail.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

But I realized during the last few weeks while trying to quit drinking that a big part of drinking for me was the opportunity to be social. Part of me being unsuccessful is that I’m going crazy with the thought of just sitting at home. A friend of mine who is also getting sober said that she has been unsuccessful in the past bc she would avoid the thought and topic of alcohol completely. She said that it still needs to be acknowledged and to not be afraid of it. 

So today I went to sit at a bar. I went to a different bar, one where the bartenders don’t know me and won’t have a beer ready  by the time I sit down. I went in with the sole intent of ordering a nonalcoholic beverage. I started a club soda with a splash of cran and a lime. While enjoying this drink I decided to look up other nonalcoholic drinks I could order. I was intrigued by the soda with a dash of bitters. To make it more interesting I ordered it with muddled oranges. I learned after I ordered  however that bitters has alcohol in it. I was almost super upset that I blew it already but I did some research and found that the amount of bitters actually used is no where near enough to feel a buzz and that it’s comparable to eating or drinking foods that naturally have alcohol. So I guess what I’m wondering is what is everyone’s thoughts on a dash of bitters in drinks when you are sober?",4

He never seems drunk, but he seems to drink all day, many days starting in the morning. 

He seems fine. I asked him about it 6 months ago and he said he was fine, feeling better than he had in a while, was drinking more than he wanted but planning to cut back at some point. 

Clearly he hasn't cut back, but with lack of any issues (never seems drunk, doesn't appear to be affecting work or even be noticable), I don't know what to say or if I even should say something again. The conversation went well the first time but I'm afraid if I keep bugging him about it, the conversations will stop going well, he'll push me away, and the drinking won't get better.

But wow if there’s one thing I’ve learned in my life it’s that I love numbing myself. I’d do it in a heartbeat if I didn’t have some pride. So yeah, I’m know I’m not myself and I know it’s definitely time for a therapist. 

I guess I had this rather naive idea in my mind when I became sober that the urge to drink would pass once I reached some point in time. Which I thought would have happened by now. Ha. Oh peaches. 


I guess I’m just unloading. I don’t have an answer for anyone here beyond don’t be discouraged by me. This is truly just my safe space and thank you so much for reading.

BUT after being approached by someone who works there and also did when I was there. He asked if I would be interested in coming back, I said yes but I didn't want anyone to get the feeling that I think I can come and go as please.  He said one of the best things to me, he said ""Well all know you're struggling/were struggling and it's not your fault, hell if we thought you were just fucking around I wouldn't be talking to you"" .

So he talked to them and I was given a 3rd chance!!! A 3rd chance!!! Those are like unheard of. 

I only accepted because I'm in a much better headspace now, no longer drinking every night regardless of what day it was or what I have to do tomorrow, I'm regularly seeing a councillor and therapist, in finally on the right meds and the right doses (took a while but glad I got there) and also this sub has helped immensely, I cannot that you enough.

Just about everything in my life is so much better than it was when I was drinking. I don't even think about drinking most days, and when I do it's usually just a passing thought.

Recently though, I tried to convince myself that I'm not an alcoholic. I was just stuck in a rut where I was drinking too much. You know, as non-alcoholics do for years at a time. /s

My sneaky addiction tried to convince me that I could totally handle a binge night now and then because that would be ""fun!"" 

I had to have a serious talk with myself in the mirror about it because *I* don't want to give up my sobriety. Only the addiction wants to drink, and she's not welcome in my life anymore. 

Drinking isn't fun. Cringing at the flashes of memories that come back after a night of drinking isn't fun. Hangovers aren't fun. Losing my family and friends' trust and respect isn't fun. Gaining weight without the joy of eating delicious food isn't fun. Falling over and breaking things isn't fun. 

Real fun is engaging in interesting and meaningful conversations (and remembering!) Fun is being present and coherent. Fun is following through on plans because I woke up with a clear head. Fun is genuinely laughing at jokes that are clever. Fun is reconnecting with my loved ones. Fun is getting out and enjoying life without having to think about how long it'll be without a drink.

Anyway, we bought a new appliance and I spent awhile in the garage cutting cardboard into manageable pieces to fit in our recycling container.

This made me think back to times I looked for excuses to do stuff in the garage - always with a closed door and away from my family. They often used to check on me, knowing full well I was drinking from some hidden stash. 

So tonight I spent the same time away and nobody bothered to check on me.  Don’t think my wife or daughter consciously thought about it but it made me so happy to see one way in which I’ve earned back trust temporarily lost by years of dishonest drinking behavior. 

There’s nothing earth shattering about this but it was a quiet moment I could appreciate and be thankful for.  It’s just one of many ways in which my life is better since I quit drinking.

I havent had a drink in 3 months and my depression and anxiety seem to have gotten even worse. I was blacking out every time I drank and putting myself in dangerous, traumatizing situations so I know I made the right decision to quit but I feel like there is something wrong with me. I keep reading threads of people feeling optimistic, enjoying good nights of sleep and improved cognitive function but I'm getting none of that. The brain fog hasn't lifted, I'm not sleeping well and even if I do get a full night of sleep I feel exhausted all the time. I have no energy or motivation at all. I know I spent the last 15 years of my life self medicating with alcohol and cant expect to immediately feel better just by quitting but I was hoping by 3 months I would at least see some improvement in my mood and overall health. What if I never feel better sober or there is something physically very wrong with me because I've neglected my health for so many years? My new insurance doesnt kick in until next month so I have to wait to get a physical and see a therapist and I'm afraid I'm going to start drinking again because that's the only way I know how to cope with feeling so hopeless and tired all the time.

Heavily as a young adult and less so as an older adult, but still consistent. I've realized it's not good for my health a long time ago. I've realized it's not good for my family.. or my pocketbook. But finding something to replace the time I used drinking has been hard. I don't have the motivation to do my old creative crafts. They just aren't the same without a beer in my hand. And learning something new is frustrating. 

I've even looked for spiritual guidance. Lost Christianity a long time ago, tried mysticism, Wicca, and even had a thing with aliens for a bit, but I'm sort of a realist/skeptic, so that all fell through.

That brings me to the book recommendation.  The book is called Remember Be Here Now by Ram Das.  It's not any sort of self help book, well not really.. Ram Das was a Harvard grad psychologist in the 60s who fell into the psychedelic mind changing scene, went to India and found spirituality, and ended up writing this weird, wild, creative, beautiful book. Now, I'm not here to sell you a spiritual doctrine or anything, but what the main focus of the book is about is finding peace in just existing, in finding what's holy inside yourself and seeing the holy in the world around you. 
It's helped me realize that it's not about replacing drinking with something else, but about being quiet and just ok with life as is. About being Here and Now. It's like a big thought experiment and is working for me. If I feel bored or agitated, I pick up the book and read a few pages. It's inspiring and soothing to the soul.

Anyways, that's my recommendation. Hope it helps someone out there. We're all in this together. IWNDWYT",13

I've said multiple times, I'm done drinking, and then I just seem to end up drinking more. This is the worst it's ever been. Just in the past few weeks, I've found myself waking up drunk, staying drunk, going to bed drunk. I've genuinely woken up at 5 in the morning, still buzzing, and have taken a swig of vodka and then gone back to sleep. I've left the house in really awful weather conditions just to buy vodka. I've made so many stupid drunken comments and caused so many silly arguments. I've told so many lies. I work with kids, so that's currently just not happening bc I won't do that drunk. I have before and I'm not proud of it at all, but that's what I mean... I'm a mess, I'm turning into a piece of shit, I don't even feel human at the moment. I can see it's affecting the way I look too, my eyes are just so dull.  Physically too, my body just feels so done. I rarely have an appetite and just generally cannot bother with eating bc I feel sick or I want to stay drunk for longer and an empty stomach helps me achieve that. Everything is just sore and I'm covered in bruises, both due to constantly hurting myself while drunk and also pretty sure some of them may be due to underlying issues caused by alcohol.

I can't bury my head and heart in the bottle anymore, if I don't stop this now, I'm going to be left with nothing. No family, no friends, no health, no job. I miss being a good daughter/sister/friend/teacher/anything. I love my students, helping them genuinely makes me happy and not the fake, fleeting happiness I feel when drunk, and not being able to commit to working regularly is draining on me mentally too. It makes me feel sick when I remember that I delivered a lesson while buzzed. I miss dedicating time to my hobbies bc all I seem to do lately is drink. Just the other day, I went to a museum with the guy I'm seeing and I had to drink a quarter of vodka beforehand to ""motivate"" myself and ensure I'd ""feel okay"". I love art and museums and things and I like this guy, but the way drinking is affecting my mood, it's as if I'm blind to any joy in my life. As if I've forgotten how to even exist sober for longer than a day.

I know I sound disgustingly dramatic in this post (I'm not drunk rn, I promise), but I also know some reading it will relate and I can't talk to anyone in my real life about my drinking in this way.

I turn 26 in about six months and am really hoping to be in a better place by then. One hour at a time, bc even one day at a time feels impossible atm. This summer, I will also hopefully become an aunt for the first time - I know, ultimately, I need to do this for myself, but that's another motivation to get through this and to the other side.

I don't really have a question, I guess I just had to get this out somewhere where I know at least one person will read it. And hopefully I can look back on this one day and be proud of how far I've come.

Thank you if you got this far.",12

Thankfully school is out until next Tuesday and I can work from home so we can recuperate, but darn this sucks.

I know it sounds silly, but I honestly thought that a shot of whiskey would really help cure the brain fog and the aches... And it might for a few moments. But I know how that turns out for me: A shot turns into a few shots, which then turns into a pint, which will indefinitely turn into two pints. Then I'd wake up tomorrow feeling double shitty and the cycle would more than likely continue with drinks again the next night. Not today. 

I'm gonna make us some hot tea and chicken noodle soup, then cuddle up in her room and binge movies on Netflix.

I have had 3 months maybe twice before in the past 15 years, but this is the first time that I have actually been putting work in on my sobriety.  I never really went further than Step One before. This time, I got my first sponsor, who I’ve been calling every night and meeting once per week in person. 

We are just starting on Step Four, which I’ve been told by many people is where a lot of people stop and then end up going out sooner or later. I am kind of at a point where I don’t really know if I am bought in to the 12 Steps being the answer for me. I kind of want to take a break and reassess where I am at, and what I want to do to maintain my sobriety.

I also am kind of tired of having to call a dude every night. I promised my sponsor that I would not drink without calling him first, and I intend to keep my word on that as long as he is my sponsor. But I have a crazy part of my brain that is resentful of the fact that I have to call him and probably be talked out of drinking if I ever want to drink. I know this doesn’t make a lot of sense. I don’t want to drink, but I want to have the option of relapsing without having to feel guilty or accountable to my sponsor.

I think the main reason it has been this easy to stay sober this long this time around is because of having a sponsor as a kind of safety net. And I know it sounds crazy but I really want to get rid of that safety net.

I don’t want to drink right now, but it’s like there is part of my brain that wants to set me up to be able to relapse more easily and with no accountability. But even if I don’t want to set myself up to fail, I don’t really want to keep doing the steps without taking a break and really thinking about it. I feel like if I were to power through doing the steps reluctantly, I wouldn’t do a very thorough job because my heart and mind are not behind it.

I ended up rambling a bit more than I thought I was gonna. I hope it makes sense (even though I know some of it doesn’t make actual sense).",5

A small centre in Southern England. Only a week of supervised detox in a place really aiming to provide a full 28 day counselling 12 step thing I was struck by so many inconsistencies.   

I guess many of our community will be familiar with the debate on whether alcoholism is a disease or the result of choice and circumstance.   But I was t and I found it weird to have the disease thing pushed so hard every day: the message being ‘hey it’s not your fault’ its genetic or a result of malfunctioning brain chemistry.   This to my addled brain sounded like an absolution like I’m not responsible.   

I didn’t find that very helpful as I try and build the reserves of inner strength to take the fight against addiction forward.  I became a problem drinker and alcoholic because I lost my job and structure and filled it with booze.  I walked my dogs in beautiful countryside which just happened to have a beautiful friendly pub exactly 2 miles from my house: allowing a great 4 mile round trip with a 4 pint pit stop.  This habitual drinking spiralled and became habitual.  A ritual, some structure, with claret to follow up in the evening.   That’s not in my genes.   That’s wilful habituated behaviour and driven by boredom and filling a void and dulling the sense of loss.

Also if it’s a disease what is the Higher Power (HP) stuff about that underpins the AA process.  How do you square the circle between the science of a disease and a loosely defined spiritual forces.  

What’s the HP up to moving in such mysterious ways and allowing such horrors to befall alcoholics and those around them.  

Then there’s the fact that I was whacked out for the whole week of massive doses of Librium - a highly addictive drug.   I’m still dopey now even after a rapid end of week tapering process.   Addictive drugs for an addict huh?   

Then there’s the commercial drivers of the treatment centres and their regulation.  Who, how, what can be done to ensure that decisions are made exclusively in the best interests of the individual while recognising that there are costs to treatment.   

Anyway I’m not trying to answer any of these questions just putting some of the inconsistencies out there that I have found.  I guess addiction and recovery thinking and philosophy is still very much work in process and that different things work for different people but I am left with so many questions.  

Sure is good to be back home and in my own bed though.  Racing mind but IWNDWYT.",4

I hate that I have this problem. This dilemma. A refusal to accept I do have to give up drinking. I shouldn’t be mad at myself for that.  But I hate it’s a problem but the real problem is not wanting to give it up. How sad. Something that is poison and tearing life away from me I don’t want to give up. That hour of feeling on top of the world shouldn’t be more than having a full life that I am actually in control of and can remember. 

I’m sure the reason why I think I’d feel so lost without it is because it’s completely taken over. 

I can get through day one. I need to get past day two. Yesterday was supposed to be day two... but I can’t go back... I can reflect but I have to see what could be better without having another morning and day of feeling ashamed and embarrassed.  I let myself lose control and I need to want control back.

2. The brain fog is started to lift! And my anxiety was a lot less on my daily commute. 
3. I slept so well, and has so much more energy today.

Wasn't all perfect, I did get tempted to go to the shop on my way home (one of my fav wines is on offer which also doesn't help!) But thinking about the small wins has helped me focus on the bigger picture.

2020-02-12 16:15:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f2y8u1/recent_wedding/,Recent Wedding,"I quit drinking over a year ago now. There's been a few ""bumps in the road"" over the past year, but by and large by a huge margin I have been completely sober. I've gotten to the point now where it's really easy to go to social events and not drink. The temptation is still there... it's just instead of a hulking silver back gorilla it's more of a spider monkey. It's much much easier to deal with and not as strong. 

So we're getting ready at the hotel and this thought pops into my head. ""I regularly go without alcohol now, it's easy for me to abstain from in these kind of events. Maybe I should talk to my wife about me having a glass of wine or a beer tonight?""

This of course is a real slippery slope which most of us on this sub will acknowledge. So I thought about it some more... how I would introduce the topic, how I would explain to my wife this could be harmless.... Then I realized that this wasn't the time or place. This wedding was for one of her good friends and me even bringing this up was going to make her anxious and put a huge decision on her lap. Best case scenario was she might be cool with it (around a .5% chance) and worst case is it blows up into a huge argument ruining the evening. So not only that, but what was I going to get out of 1 glass of wine, or 1 beer? I knew deep down that it wasn't about one drink... it was about having one, then sneaking off to pound another, then maybe I could convince her to let me order a second (actually my third)... so on and so on... In the end I decided against bringing it up and just not drinking like I normally would do, and that's what I did. 

So second part of this post is this guy Jason I ran into. Jason is an alcoholic. He hasn't admitted that to anyone but the writing is on the wall in about 20 different ways. He's the spouse of one of my wife's co-workers and I've been around him many times in the past, but not in a couple years recently. 

So I run into him after the ceremony and he seems ""not drunk"", which isn't to say he hasn't already had 6 beers. We get to chatting (reluctantly on my end because he's extremely obnoxious and not someone I particularly like to be around). He starts asking about if I still like ""good beer"" (I was a craft beer conoseiur... a fancy booze bag lol) I explained to him that no, I don't really drink any more. Haven't in over a year. He kind of looked at me curiously and a little suspiciously which most drinkers do of people who say they don't drink. I explained since having our first child that I simply can't drink anymore, which is true but not the entire truth. The real truth is that I have a problem controlling my drinking, but I don't like to go there with people generally. He started to ramble about how he only drinks ""casually"" now because he doesn't drink bud light, only good beers. LOL. I can see the justification in his head going on as he's talking. I just nod and say ""yeah"". Then, after a couple minutes he just blurts out ""you know, sometimes I wonder if I should just stop drinking completely."" To which I said ""yeah, maybe.""   


So fat forward to the end of the reception, and Jason has been posted up to the bar pounding craft beers all night. Not trying to make conversation with anyone, just kind of standing there getting loaded and looking at his phone. At this point he can't even really talk, he's just swaying and standing there with a blank stare. I on the other hand actually had fun the whole night, and didn't drink anything stronger than coffee. I noticed before they left his wife come over to our area and looked like she had been crying. She said something to the effect of ""Jason is shitfaced and we have to go"". They said their good byes, Jason not even able to speak and this point and just gave a nod, and then they left. While my wife and I waited for our Uber I realized how happy I am that I can actually enjoy my life again without being numbed to the point of being unable to speak. I was really proud of the decisions I made that entire night.

We've known each other for 24 years. At first we got on great and had some good times. Great shared experiences for a young man finding his way in the world. You were my friend.

Back then it was fun, it was new. Chasing pretty girls and sunshine.

After a couple of years though you started to cause me problems. I couldn't remember things, silly injuries, getting me into scrapes, losing stuff. And stupid, stupid juvenile behaviour. You even had me falling asleep in bars and shit.

I stuck with you though. I thought the good times we had outweighed the bad. Plus you were friends with all my mates. We all thought you were a good egg.

But these last few years have been tough. You have really started to show your true colours. 

You have been bad for my body, bad for my mind and bad for my health. You have embarassed me in front of my colleagues. You have made me feel like shit. You have even jeopardised my relationships with others. You have regularly put me at risk and made me out of control of my senses.

And you know what, I've had enough. I deserve better than you. I thought you were my friend but you are nothing of the sort.

So I am saying goodbye. You won't be seeing me again, alcohol. Our time has run its course. Its over. You betrayed my friendship. This is the end.

And one last thing. If you ever show up here again, I'll kick your fucking arse you piece of shit.",91

When I first stopped it was difficult to imagine past the end of the day.  All I could focus on was not drinking.  Now that the emotional turmoil has passed for the most part I am able to take a step back and see how much has actually changed from all the small seemingly inconsequential changes I've made.  Examples:

- Since I am sober at night I can make good bed time decisions and go to bed at a reasonable hour.  Regular, good sleep for months on end has saved me from being an irritable impatient bitch. I'm nice and I see good in people far more now, even when they cut me off in traffic.

- Not drinking allowed me to be aware enough of my body to realize how a lot of foods and trend diets make me sick.  I never would have known to research and experiment with foods if I wasn't aware of my body's reaction to normal foods.  When I was drunk or hungover (my only two states of existence before) I felt like so much shit the health issues were buried beneath it.  I cut out dairy in August and promptly lost 40 pounds eating the highest quantity of food I've eaten in my life.  I am healthy.  I look like a different person.

- I have things to look forward to.  I make plans that I know I'll keep.  I'm not a flake anymore.  I learned to say no to things I don't want to do (HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE!)

Life gets better.  I still have a shit ton of financial problems.  But now I know that I can get through it without the crutch.  This sub and my partner have been monumental in my success.  So I thank each and every one of you.  I don't post much but I lurk every day.

I have a close family friend whom I grew up with. They have had a rough past and subsequently moved across the country several years ago. Leaving their parents behind, which I remain close with. During a recent visit with this old friend, I discovered their severe addiction to alcohol, cocaine, and (probably) other substances to the point that it has altered their physical appearance, and brought about a nervous tic, among other things. I have only spoken to him about this new addiction in passing. Avoiding the word ""addiction"" at all costs. Over the past few months, his parents have been reaching out to me asking about their son, as they aren't able to keep in touch with him. I am torn on whether or not to tell his parents or maybe talk to him myself. The distance makes helping him extremely difficult. I'm one of the only people he stays in contact with after all of these years, and I fear he has no one else close to him. I have had many friends who suffer from addiction in the past, and I know how delicate it can be to handle. Any advice is much appreciated.",5

Getting to the gym, feeling healthier, even had a successful job interview, which I'm usually terrible at. So I'm currently feeling pretty positive about life, which is unusual for me. 

However, I've been feeling a little complacent the last week. Haven't really been thinking about alcohol, but I know it's coming. Inevitably, I will get a case of the ""fuck its"", whether I am feeling like I want to celebrate a good day or forget a bad day in a whiskey glass. Maybe today. Maybe next week. Maybe next month.

2020-02-12 12:44:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f2uy1f/6_months_sober/,6 Months Sober,"Today's my six month sober anniversary.

I quit on my 40th birthday. I wasn't an alcoholic, but I knew that I was drinking too frequently. I am also prone to panic attacks and anxiety, and I knew I was using alcohol to mask it, as opposed to dealing with my problems head on. I thought a lot about giving up alcohol entirely, and I toyed with the idea for about a year before I actually did it. I did dry January in 2019, and I was surprised by how easy it was, and how weird, but ok, attending my first wedding as a sober person was. As I counted down to my 40th birthday in August, I (coincidentally) was in a position where I was having drinks with family every night. As the days got closer, and as I drank glasses and pints of wine and beer respectively every night, I knew that I was making the right decision. I just knew. And I remember drinking the last drop from my wine glass the night before my birthday and being fully committed to quitting forever. And that was that. I think a lot about the fact that ""I just knew,"" and I wish I could replicate that definitiveness in other areas of my life.

I want to thank these two people who really helped to cement my decision; a decision I've never regretted:

Sarah Levy (NY Times article): [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/fashion/weddings/how-i-survived-wedding-season-in-my-first-year-of-sobriety.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/fashion/weddings/how-i-survived-wedding-season-in-my-first-year-of-sobriety.html)

Adrian Chiles - Drinkers Like Me (YouTube - 1 hour): [https://youtu.be/RX2opvj7WE8](https://youtu.be/RX2opvj7WE8)

As I reflect on my six months sober, I need to be honest and say that sobriety hasn't solved everything. I had three panic attacks in three days late last year during a particularly stressful time at work. My weight hasn't changed at all, and I need to get rid of the voice saying that I can binge eat to compensate for sobriety (spoiler: you can't). Without exception, no one has been anything less that very understanding when I tell them that I no longer drink. And if anyone ever starts to make a big deal about it, I'm aware that it says a lot more about them than it does about me. But there are definite plusses. Waking up without a headache is a gift, as is my general quality of sleep every night. Driving with the knowledge that I'm fully alert, especially at night. Knowing that I'm 100% myself when I'm in a conversation, even if it doesn't go well.

I've lurked here in the past but today I'm posting to keep myself accountable. I'm 33, married with two kids and I'm a stay at home mom. I took my daughter to preschool late today because I went out with friends from my neighborhood last night and got out of control sloppy drunk and feel like shit today. We were even later than we might have been because I discovered I left my purse at my neighbor's house (with my car keys) as we were walking out the door. I had to text her and by sheer chance she hadn't locked their front door this morning so I was able to go get it. I was already deep into the shame and anxiety cycle that follows drinking for me but this is what really broke me. The fact that I let my daughter down and let my drinking interfere with her school day. The fact that one of her teachers came out to meet us at the car and I probably reeked of it. The fact that I was embarrassingly drunk and oversharing with my neighbors last night. That I threw up and had to put all my clothes in the washer and shower and clean it up in the middle of the night. That instead of working out like I'd normally be doing when she's in school, I'm in bed dozing and feeling horrible.

I don't really have an issue with the frequency of my drinking so I've been able to downplay it to myself and rationalize it. But I can't moderate when I do drink and I don't want to be this person anymore. I quit drinking for 6 months last year after a series of overly drunk nights and bad decision making. I felt like I had it under control and started drinking again last summer but it's time for me to acknowledge that I will never have it under control and abstaining is the only choice I have.  I hate that I can't just have a few drinks and have fun but I am not that person and it's time to acknowledge that and commit to this.

I'm so thankful that this community exists and looking forward to not drinking with you all!!",170

Then that other part of my brain chimed in\*, ""Oh, FUCK THAT! Do you want to wait until you get a DUI? Do you want to wait and hurt your family? Do you want to wait to watch your health crumble?""

I've learned that setting nebulous goals, ""Quit For-evah!"" don't work for me, so I set a simple, short-term goal: quit for 100 days.

Btw, starting at about day 80 or so, I began to have some serious and *constant* low-key mental discussions with myself on whether I was going to have a drink on day 101.

Which morphed into how much and what I was going to drink.

Which morphed into ""Well you can have a big ole glass of go fuck yourself, we're not having a drink at all and btw fuck you."" 

Which morphed into, ""What's this 'we'? You got a mouse in your pocket?""

Which led to me turning off the audio in my dash-cam.

Anyway...

Any reason for quitting is a valid reason.

Any attempt to quit can be successful.

You don't need to quit for ""forever,"" just quit for today.

You didn't drink yesterday? Do it again today. 

You fell off of the wagon yesterday? Many of us have also done that. It happens. No shame in trying and failing. Try again.

Try again.

Try again.


Day 159 is still Day 1

They're all Day 1

I'm a very-intermittent poster here over the last several years. I've known stopping drinking was a good idea for me for 5-6 years now and have been creeping towards that goal ever since. I definitely agree with relapsing being not a failure but just another step along the journey of learning more about yourself and the addictive nature of alcohol.

I've done dry-Januaries the last 3-4 years and every time I enjoy \_not\_ having alcohol in my life! So I've done it again this year and for me, this one has been the easiest one as far as not being tempted to drink. It's a new decade, I'm 42 now, my father (an alcoholic who I have a complicated relationship with) is probably going to pass away in the next year or two... a bunch of great reasons to get grounded.

In short, I feel great about my decision and more confident about it than ever. Told my wife a couple weeks ago, ""Before, the hardest part has been the stigma from other people. But now I don't give a shit, I know I feel better not drinking!""

The hard part is having zero support. All my friends are drinkers and over the last couple of decades I've basically been a ringleader of the group. A quarterback for the drinking team. They all are at various points within their own journeys, but it seems like none of them have any insight into mine... or they haven't come near reaching the end of their drinking-rope yet (or at least, are damn sure not going to admit it).

The worst is my wife, who is that baffling drinker who can have two glasses of wine a night and be totally fine with leaving it there. The other day she said my stopping drinking entirely was ""annoying."" And shit.... that about ruined my day. I've been so positive about my decision and feeling so good, but having your closest friend belittle the effort... it's difficult to process.

I've told her, ""You don't drink like I have, you're not on the same playing field!"" But she just doesn't seem to get it, or just doesn't want to. I've read so much quit-lit lately :) so I'm armed to the teeth with anti-alcohol facts.. and I've been super-careful about not preaching any of it: ""I'm cool with you drinking as long as you're cool with me not drinking.""

So, I literally have nobody to talk to about sobriety.. and so here I am. Back here again.

I really appreciate this community existing. Hope you all are well today!",67

I've been truly struggling for 2 years, as basically rock bottom. In a nutshell I moved somewhere I didn't want to move from a job I was progressing in very well (which I couldn't take up again when I moved) because my husband took a new job without much discussion with me about it. Then, about 3 months later, my mom got sick and was in a coma for 2 weeks and I was there for 6 weeks to help her learn to walk, eat, function again. When my brothers just weren't there to help at all. I was alone and then had to deal with a lot of turbulent family stuff. I haven't been the same since.

My husband has dealt with the aftermath of this. I've been angry ever since. All the time. Even with meds and therapy. And that's the short story.

So now, I've been drinking a lot to deal with my anger. And sadness. And frustration. I've not been myself.

And then my mom passed away at age 55 on Nov 21, 2019. I've really not been myself since and I can't accept she's gone. Again, been seeing a councilor but I'm just heart broken and can't get back up. So I keep drinking as a way to stop feeling.

I've been angry when I drink and say some mean things to my husband which I never remember because I've drank so much. He says I can't say I'm not accountable for this. That I am accountable for what I say. And again I never remember saying any of this.

I understand being accountable for drinking too much. But if I don't remember saying these things, which I don't actually feel when I'm sober...is it fair for that person to hold it against me while I'm trying to get sober?

It's been a long journey for me to this point - I'm 29/M and I have been indulging in heavy binge drinking 3-5 times a week now for the last 8 years, mostly to numb the feelings I have over my parents' bitter divorce 10 years ago and the passing of my father 3 years ago. I live in New York City so drinking is such a major part of social culture here and my habits have slowly and consistently gotten out of hand without me even realizing I had a problem. Recently it's to the point where I've puked and blacked out every night I go out. After the end of my last relationship I decided it's time to get a grip on things. **Today is my 5th day sober in a row - I've been sober 14 of the last 15 days with a blip last Friday. My goal is to be sober indefinitely.** 

I've already noticed a remarkable change in my thinking and my emotions. It's really astonishing how horrid and twisted I can become when drinking regularly and I'm absolutely done with it because it's destroyed too many relationships and friendships and causes so much unnecessary damage in other aspects of my life as well. With this newfound clarity I've decided to spend my time and energy fixing things with the people I've hurt, especially my recent ex-girlfriend - with whom I drove our relationship into the ground due to my angry and volatile alcohol-fueled outbursts. It's deeply tragic to me that alcohol cost me my best friend and someone I truly loved, but as I am a believer in the divine I do see this as a blessing in disguise and a catalyst for positive change in my life. 

I don't normally post on forums because I'm a pretty reserved person but spending time here reading all of your wonderful stories of success, love, support, and warmth has inspired me to join your community, make a major life change, and try to repair the damage I've done to people who I truly, deeply love. There's so much stigma around admitting to anyone that you have a substance problem but I've realized that there is abundant strength and power in admitting your flaws and weaknesses and working diligently to correct them.

It touches on all the ideas covered in The Naked Mind, Alcohol Explained, etc. I enjoyed it because it focuses on social drinking which pertains to a majority of drinkers. I really think that even casual and social drinking leads to so many physical and mental health issues. Only negative thought is that I was never really a social drinker. I always drank secretly at home in the late evenings. So I wasn’t worried about losing a social life because I never had one! Rather spend time with my family and work.

Most of my friends are pretty heavy drinkers, and they all like to throw a good party. Being on Whole 30 has been an easy out for why I can’t drink, just like I can’t eat cheese or bread or sugar. But now it’s over and I’m trying to figure out how to deal with not having an “excuse” for not drinking.

I’m close to 50 days sober now, and I want to keep moving forward but I guess the tougher conversations are going to come with that. My husband has already been touting how excited he is for us to be able to have wine together for Valentine’s Day (I got him on the crazy diet train with me, so he’s also been booze free for a month). Last night I was excited that we were done (mostly cause, y’know, I have a candy bar in the pantry that has been calling my name deep into the night), and he loudly declared “AND IM GONNA GET DRUNK THIS WEEKEND!” It was a huge turn off and I just kind of half laughed and half sighed. I know he was joking, and he did say yeah, maybe not, but it was super discouraging. I don’t mind if he drinks, or if our friends drink, but the pressure and constant reminders that alcohol has been just a given most of my life is unsettling.

Had my first drunk dream in a while after that last night. I was at a resort with free margaritas and the minute I had one I was miserable but knew I was just gonna keep drinking for the day since I already fucked up. I was pissed at myself when I woke up, then felt better, and now I’m just frustrated that after 30 days of easily limiting the topic of alcohol, I’m probably about to be bombarded with reminders of it everywhere. I love my husband; he isn’t as bad as I was and didn’t have the withdrawal symptoms I had at the beginning, but he absolutely has some degree of a drinking problem and will probably go straight back to using it for nightly stress relief.

I know this is a common subject, but for those of you who aren’t ready/able to tell your friends that you’re an alcoholic and will probably die if they try to peer pressure you into a game of beer pong: what’s your line for turning down alcohol? I know I can go with a simple “hey, I’ve been off the sauce for a month and feeling better than I have in years,” but I could use some fun quips to throw in people’s faces. I love a good snark, and I could use some fun ones to cheer me up :)",4

2020-02-12 10:31:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f2sw7z/need_advice/,Need advice,"(Sorry in advance for the long post. Just trying to provide context.)

Day 3 here. I'm expecting a lot of different takes on this, but I feel like a lot of different opinions is what I need.

So, I've been where most of us have been. You wake up, and you've ... Name it. But you've done something, and your SO is not happy about it.

My girlfriend has been very easy on me as far as it goes, but obviously if I've really made a mess, or said something thoughtless or critical, she rightfully  is more upset and lets me know it. Nothing like yelling or anything. And even after I quit for few days, she'll even ask if I want a single or something. Call her an enabler, but of course I appreciated it at the time. Just wanted to give the tone on my usual cycle, and our dynamic. There's even been a couple times when she's given me the ultimatum, and then a week later we're back at it.

So, this last time, what really drove me to quit for good, is that she followed through. She broke up with me...really for about a day. We're still together. But here's where I need advice:

Our house is generally not super tidy, we raise her two disabled kids together. So that dreaded Sunday, instead of starting drinking early and then proceeding to just be drunk and watch TV/run errands, I started drinking early, took some stimulants, and started cleaning the crap out of the house. I got the kitchen and living room, then, once she woke up, I got after our room and bathroom, which need the most attention since we both really neglect ourselves....

Anyway, I'm going through with a trashbag, headphones on (she's in the kitchen doing something for the girls), picking up all the empty shampoo bottles and miscellaneous ""girl"" minutiae, the mountain of empty water bottles, toilet paper rolls... You get the picture.

That's when she comes in to tell me we need to talk.

First off, I'm not using this as an excuse to drink. Know that. But today, she tells me she still loves me, but that she may be a little distant for a bit.

This might be a word I've seen on here called ""rationalizing"" but how would I know, right?

If some of you have had similar experiences, you know I'm not trying to excuse the bad things I've done while drunk, but that I feel punished for good behavior. That's why I'm quitting, because overall she's obviously right. Most of the time, I'm either a burden or downright horrible while drunk. Just. Not this time.

But my question is: Do I have any valid reason to think it was anywhere from a little unfair, to downright shitty timing, for the straw that broke the camel's back, to be me cleaning while drinking?

Another way to ask it: Do I have any reason to feel salty that her reaction is what I would expect if I had vomited on the couch or something, not for Helping While Intoxicated?",3

I went nearly a week without drinking, felt on top of the world and the healthiest I have felt.

I didn’t miss them, I missed the shots. 

So here I go, back to day 1 of sobriety. Back to the depressed feelings I had last week and the nasty hangover that will take all day to get over. Back to the night sweats that will happen again the next 4-5 days. Back to a disappointed wife. Back to starting over. 

This may be a restart but it will be the best restart because I now remember why I started my path to sobriety, this feeling is dreadful. I never want to feel it again. I will crawl out of this hole and and I will not drink today!

I’m hoping to get some insight from you all! A bit of background - I’ve been struggling with drinking for about 18 months. I was self medicating anxiety. After lots of rigamarole and misdiagnosis, I was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Now that I’m on the right meds I fee great!

A benefit I noticed is that my overwhelming craving to drink seems to be gone. However, the underlying habit is still there. As I’ve become more mentally stable, I’ve noticed a lot of unhealthy coping mechanism that have become habits. It’s confusing because that NEED to drink to quiet my brain is gone. But I often still habitually drink a beer, even if I don’t necessarily want it?

Beer is my big weakness. I’ve considered asking my partner to not keep it in the house. I fee bad because I’ve made that request many times and lapsed. But now that I’m learning more about my brain I’m more confident I will be successful. For me, I don’t even care if there is wine and liquor in the house. My counselor suggested I’m really not asking that much by simple not having a stock of beer in the house. Still feels like a big ask.

Any tips for creating new habits? The only thing I want to mention - I really really want to start running. But have some joint issues I need resolved once my finances are better! Hopefully sobriety = improved finances!",4

I struggled immensely to explain to those (family and professional) who didn’t understand my addiction what it felt like to have progressed to the point where I was unable to stop drinking, despite the fact that I desperately wanted to. This is the closest passage I’ve found that comes to explaining it.

You’re in a tight pair of handcuffs without a key and everyone blames you for it. You may have put them on yourself but you don’t really remember doing it, and you are very sorry that you did. You feel miserable so you go to see a doctor about the handcuffs. They’re chafing your wrists and the skin is infected. Your partner is upset you are no longer doing your part around the house. You find it hard to take the bins out in handcuffs. The doctor person tells you how bad it is to be in these handcuffs. The infection on your wrists could kill you if you’re not careful. You need to get out of them as soon as possible. He goes on to tell you all of the reasons you should take them off - they are affecting your family, your health and your life. He tells you how difficult it is to look after others with the handcuffs on and that they will feel unloved. But he doesn’t have the key. So nothing he says actually helps set you free.

Healthcare professionals couldn’t help me get clean. Neither could the good will and support of friends and family. Fellow alcoholics and addicts who understood my plight helped get me clean. IWNDWYT.",20

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Things look different in a different light. Have you noticed? My 6 year old is afraid of the dark, so I was up in the middle of the night following her to the bathroom, navigating past obstacles and scary shadows. But in the morning light, there are no dangers, just toys and teddy bears.

When I was drinking, I couldn´t see a way out. I couldn´t even imagine a better future. When I stopped, darkness slowly gave way to light, and a brand new world emerged. It´s almost magical!",92

I really have no-one else to tell this and I feel like it's important for me to be able to tell someone, to put it out there even if no-one read or cared, so that's why I'm making this post. I've been sober for a whole week for the first time since I don't even know when... that is all. :) 

In exactly one week from now, I'll post again saying I've been sober for two weeks. If I don't, it means I've given up and I'm out there somewhere drinking and hating myself. But I hope not, I hope I can hold myself accountable. That's what I'm trying to do.

It's been a rough year to say the least. Definitely been on some of my worst benders since the breakup. Not eating, not sleeping, drinking and driving, drinking before work. And to top it all off I've been in a severe manic episode for the past few months (recently crashed about two weeks ago and am now in a depressive episode). Anyways, I'm kind of seeing this guy. I mean he's my friend but we've been having sex and cuddling, spending time together, sharing intimacies. He's moving to New York in a few months so that absolutely sucks, as well. But anyways, I told him the other night that I struggle with addiction, specifically alcohol use. I told him I overdosed at work a couple years ago. Then today I told him I went to an AA meeting (instead of going to class which I felt he judged me for skipping). I guess I'm just struggling with being open and honest with people...vulnerable. It feels horrible. I usually immediately regret it. It's like now it feels like there's this spotlight on me. He doesn't really drink so I've been drinking a lot less ever since I started hanging out with him. But now I feel like he'll just treat me differently, thinks I'm a mess, not worth his time. I feel like a lot of this is me projecting my own insecurities. It's not like he said or did anything after that would lead someone to believe he was being judgmental. I mean I'm sure he was concerned. But idk. I also just recently cut myself and he saw that and that's another reason he probably thinks I'm a chaotic mess. I know it's like people who judge you for your addictions or mental illnesses probably aren't worth having in your life. But how do I get over that projection of my own insecurities? How do I not feel cringe-y and horrible and vulnerable after opening up to people about my addiction. I'm also not fully sober...it was literally my very first AA meeting tonight...so I feel like now I just can't drink in front of him, like he won't invite me out to bars anymore, or even over to hang out :/ I also told my parents today that I went to AA. Also vulnerable and scary and meh. It's like I know it's good to have that accountability, to be honest and communicative with your support system, but why does it always feel so damn regretful and vulnerable and downright horrible?? I hate having addiction.",3

Life since Dec 30th has been emotional, consuming and just plain hard. I found out that day my annual mammogram was abnormal. Ok, it happens.

I have a large mass that is recommended to come out. I left there without going to the liquor store 😊  I meet with the surgeon on the 28th of Jan and get told this mass was very tiny and non concerning the year before but has now more than quadrupled in size. It's coming out and will be tested for cancer. There was the word I was afraid of  - now I'm scared ☹ surgery on Feb 5th! Still not drinking, making jokes about how it would help me sleep, but know I'm not gonna do it.  Surgery day - I can handle pain, but damn that hurt!  Now I wait, wait for these results.

Don’t have too many people in my life who are sober or know how to respond when I talk about sobriety. I am surrounded by a lot
of people proud of how hammered they get every weekend and I can no longer relate. Also, a lot of people that didn’t know me when I drank so don’t realize what an accomplishment this is for me. I have also had a lot of friends who (meaning well) have commented “oh well you didn’t drink that much anyway” or I am reminded of the fact that I didn’t lose a job, come to work drunk, or get a DUI. Like somehow it was easy because I wasn’t a “bad enough alcoholic.”

A lot of work went into these past three years including A LOT of unpacking done with the help of an amazing therapist (therapy is great!). Pushing me to face hard truths, giving me homework, and keeping me accountable. Really helped me examine what I was doing, what I was missing, and healthier ways to fill those voids. 

A lot of help from an amazing PCP (nurse practitioners are great!) who asked me questions about work stress, my relationships, how much sleep I was getting, put me on medication for insomnia, encouraged me to go to therapy, asked me what I was eating, how much I exercised and meditated until I did both regularly and no longer needed meds to sleep, started me on antidepressants, switched and adjusted them until they worked for me. Follows up with me regularly and reminds me if how far I have come. I am so lucky to have these two. This is how all providers should be!

And of course, meeting a wonderful man who also battles depression and has encouraged me to stay sober by also staying (mostly) away from alcohol. We get married in nine days!

I think my biggest take away from the past three years has been that I have experienced every single second of my life SOBER. I have not had anything to numb any discomfort, nothing to make anxiety fuzzy, nothing to accompany me while I wallow in depression, nothing to put me to sleep, nothing to make me seem more relaxed or funny or silly or blame for my actions. That said... I have still navigated really difficult experiences. I have gone on a first date sober. I’ve gone to big parties where I didn’t know anyone sober. I found ways to have my emotions and accept them for what they are. I have found that people like me just fine sober!

I never got in trouble, excelled in school, was always a role model for others. I never drank as a teenager because I know it seriously messed up lives and I did not want to be one of those. After getting out of college, I decided I needed to loosen up a little bit. I was 22 and I asked my closest friends to take me out drinking. That one night became another and I began getting more comfortable with alcohol. 

I am not much of a social person so I prefer to stay at home. Instead of going out to drink, I began to have a glass of whatever while playing video games or watching a movie. It began to slowly creep up in my life. I noticed this last year and decided to cut back. I reduced my drinking, did sober October, etc. 

While my tolerance went down, my causality with it did not. Typically if I was out while having a drink, I would limit myself to a maximum of two drinks, give myself plenty of time, and be sure to have plenty of water and food if possible. 

This weekend was my last show with my band. I was leaving at the end of the month to become a pilot. Typically I don’t drink while I’m playing because I want my musical ability to be at its best. Since it was my last show, the band bought me a shot. Soon after the bar bought me a shot. I figured I was probably fine since I had half an hour of music plus an hour of clean up before I had to drive. 

About a mile after I left the gig, I see the police lights behind me. I was arrested for OVI with a .119 BAC. My arraignment is this Thursday and I am terrified on how this will affect my career. I went home and threw away all my alcohol and looked into AA. I honestly don’t think AA is for me because I don’t think I have a dependance on it.  I know I need change though. 

I knew much better than this. Luckily nobody was hurt but it makes me think about all the people who could have been. I don’t really know why I’m telling everyone on here this but I feel I need to. It is amazing how the “oh just this once” will turn into a life altering mistake. I think I need the help of a community that has similar situations.",12

One thing I know for sure is that drinking will never make it better.,"The initial reason I began abusing alcohol was to cope with depression & anxiety. The hard part about being sober sometimes is those feelings still exist & will creep up without warning. I used to always just drink through them & wake up with added shame & more reason to be depressed & anxious based on my actions while drunk. I had a couple of hard days over the weekend for inexplicable reasons... I just woke up feeling doomed. I woke up today & finally feel like the weight has lifted just as mysteriously as it appeared. I had fantasies about relapsing during those few days of depression & I am SO happy I didn't give in. 

For anyone out there having a difficult time today for any reason, remember you can deal with these feelings without alcohol, & you'll be so happy when you make it out on the other side.

He called me at 1230am barely coherent and said he needed a ride. I went and got him. I had to basically carry him inside and put him in bed, along with all the other fun stuff that comes with that. When he woke up the next morning he totally ignored what happened the night before, slept the whole way back to his apartment, and was most likely still drunk. When I dropped him off I went inside to find his aprt full of empty beer cans and half drank bottles of liqour, and a few empty boxes of pizza. It was depressing, Ive known him since the 7th grade. It's tough to see that being a sustainable way for someone to live. And this wasnt the first dumbass thing ive heard hes done recently.

It took all I had not to jump his shit, but I knew if someone did that to me a couple years ago I wouldnt have thought twice about never talking to them again. I understand alcoholism doesnt seem to make people reasonable. I want to give him a call this week, or stop by and check in on him and chat. Something clearly isn't right and I'm worried. 

Has anyone worked with something like this? Had any luck? When I quit drinking our lives basically became the inverse of one another's. I dont know if he'll even listen to me without viewing me as like self righteous. Idk, thanks for any advice!",10

Idk where to start. I’m so ashamed. I hate getting sick every morning. I did just stop for about two weeks but it’s like I don’t deserve to be okay with how poorly I treat myself.

It isn't the first time I have gone overboard, in fact, as my wife put it, ""You've puked more in your 30s than you ever did in your 20's"".

I woke up on Saturday morning (02.08.2020) with one of the worst hangovers I've ever had in my life. It was around 10am. I could tell my wife was pissed at me. She said I had some stuff to clean up around the house. 

The night before I went out with some friends and one beer led to 5 more at the local brewery. On the way home I stopped (I had a sober cab) for a 12er of double IPA's, I came home drunk and it should have been enough, I was feeling good. But instead I sat down to play some video games and before I knew it I was running to the bathroom in a haze throwing up in my mouth trying to make it to the toilet. 

I didn't make it in time, and I left a trail throughout the house.

I puked all over myself, all over my children's new clothes, all over the bathroom. And I am completely ashamed and mortified.

My wife asked if I remembered her coming into the bathroom. I didn't. I can't imagine what it would have been like if my kids saw me in that state, thankfully, they didn't.

I'm glad I didn't aspirate to death.

I've tried a lot over the years to quit drinking, I would always hide it behind I want to lose weight (I do), or do sober October, or whatever else was easier to say out loud, and I could stick to it for a couple weeks, but then I'd hop right back on the wagon and drink more and more and more. Recently, more than 2 cases of craft IPAs in a week. I have a lot of stories that mirror the one I shared above, but I want this one to be the last I share and I want to be a source of hope for others.

Thankfully, I have an awesome wife and support network in addition to therapy lined up, but for the first time in my life I am being honest with myself and admitting I am addicted to alcohol. 

I just popped a LaCroix, I am snuggling with my kids, and I am proud to say when the sun sets and I rest for the night this will be my 4th day sober.",202

tldr: Is there any helpful advice people here can give me for resisting temptation DURING my hobbies? That's when I feel like I would be having more fun if I were drinking.

All of our individual situations are different, but I'd love to hear from people who went sober who in a similar situation to me:

I already exercise regularly and fill my time with hobbies. I have a weekday 8-5 job that I don't hate, with coworkers I get along with, and a boss that never micromanages. My drinking problem is mostly a binging thing, and I would do it DURING my two hobbies: video gaming/streaming, but moreso at dance.

Most of the advice you find online for alcohol addiction is to become healthier (exercice, eat healthy) and to fill your time with hobbies. That doesn't help me. I drank because I felt it made my hobbies more fun. The people I do these hobbies with aren't always drinking, and rarely as much as I did. So it's not a case of ""get rid of the unhealthy people in your life"" or ""get rid of the unhealthy activities in your life."" I'm not going to stop playing video games/streaming video games, and I'm not going to stop teaching/competing/socializing in this dance.

Is there any helpful advice people here can give me for resisting temptation DURING my hobbies? That's when I feel like I would be having more fun if I were drinking.

Thanks for all the support! I appreciate all of you.

Afterthought: my family and friends are VERY supportive and proud of me, especially during dance. They help a lot, but it's still REALLY hard to enjoy my hobbies as much without alcohol.",7

Will be checking in on this forum as it is uplifting to see the success stories and how much life can be better without booze.

Even though I am a full blown adult, I feel like a child most of the time because I feel like I can't handle anything.","I heard that drinking stunts your emotional growth and that in theory, your true emotional age is the age when you started drinking. So lets say you started drinking at 17 and drank solidly until you were 30. Although your physical age is 30, you would have the emotional maturity of a 17 year old.

For me, there may be a lot of truth in this idea because I look around and other people my age (early 30's) and they seem to be able to handle life, whereas I still feel like a kid and a total mess. Life is hard! Life is fucking hard! And drinking allowed me to forget that. I know drinking never solved anything and was just making things harder in the long run, but wow, sobering up makes me feel like a fraud because I feel ill equipped to be here at this age. Maybe it's because I really haven't developed the same emotional and coping skills like other people my age since I have mostly drank the last decade away.

I blacked out my third time drinking.  I drank to the point that I blacked out many many many times after that partying through my high school and college years.  Through those years and for a few years after college I was a weekend warrior.  Ten years of hard partying and drinking to blackouts, but only on the weekends.  During those years I was arrested a handful of times for open containers in cars, under age possession, and probably worst of all kicking in the front door of an apartment building that I thought I was staying at while visiting friends - the actual apartment was several miles away.  Through these eye open arrests and uncountable daylong hangovers I never considered reducing my drinking.   As I moved into my professional career, got married and had kids, my drinking habits slowly morphed away from the weekend warrior and into the nightly consumption of wine.  What was originally a habit of splitting one bottle each night with my spouse become a nightly habit of consuming a single bottle, or even a bit more on my own and even more on weekends.  Within the past few months, I've found myself occasionally cracking a beer at 9 am on a Sunday to shake the cobwebs from a heavy Saturday evening - drinking in front of the TV while my wife was napping on the couch.  My real eye opener was finding myself one Sunday morning running errands and deciding to by a six pack of high % beer.  I specifically opted for cans over bottles because they were easier to hide.  Throughout the late morning and into the afternoon I went out into the yard to do ""yard work"" and snuck into the truck to slug beers.  After the beers were gone, I moved on to adding vodka to flavored sparkling water and drank that throughout the remainder of the day.  After the kids were in bed, I polished off a whole bottle of wine.  I awoke the next day with a foggy brain and a patchy memory of the previous day.  I manned up and went to work in a daze.  In the parking lot at work I had a panic attack and my hand shook uncontrollably as I tried to drink my Gatorade.  I suffered through the day avoiding everyone at all cost.  I had a few similar weekends since then during the holiday season that I am also not proud of, but hiding in the back of my truck secretly slamming beers just really sticks with me as a low point.  Reflecting on these recent changes in drinking behavior, I've recently decided that I need to make a change.  I am terrified that my health will be impacted and I won't be here for my kids.  Today I am 9 days sober.  I haven't gone this long without consuming alcohol in over 10 years and have been heavily drinking for 20.  I am only 36. That means I have been at it for more than half my life and for my entire adulthood to date.  I've been reading books such as The Naked Mind and Alcohol Lied To Me which have been helpful, as has been reading posts in this online community.  I'm not necessarily looking for the community to respond, but would like to hear how other folks got their starts in sobriety.  If nothing else it feels good to get this off my chest.  IWNDWYT",20
2020-02-11 15:33:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f2ehpv/one_year_today/,One Year Today,"I have been reflecting today on what got me to this year sober.  As I sit and think about what to write here, my first instinct is to think of the upvotes.  What is going to get good traction?  What do people tend to like here?  Should I write a lot?  Keep it brief?  Maybe I shouldn't mention AA or God too much.  This is a great metaphor or analogy to a lot of the stuff I have been working on.  So instead, I'm just going to share from the heart, and be authentic and honest.  So much of my life is me trying to look a certain way, and manage the thoughts or perceptions of others, chasing ""my story"" of what I think about myself, and what I want out of life.  That chase for the ego, and money, property and prestige has led me down a dark road.  I have found that to be a futile pursuit, there is never enough, happiness is always just over the horizon.

This is not the first time I have been sober for a year, though hopefully it is my last.  It's been a journey since early 2011, with a few years sober here, 9 months there, but if I had to pin down what makes it different this time is my commitment and engagement to really be sober, and fully embrace this recovery lifestyle.  I have always had a sort of do it my way, don't sell out, don't be a follower mentality that led to me learning the hard way over and over that when I don't follow the advice of the medical community, and the recovery community, I rarely come out on top.  For one, I was always dipping my toe out of sobriety, a little pot smoking on the holidays, etc, that just fed the shame and isolation of being out of control, and relying on substance use to complete me.  I also resisted being a part of the AA community, and kept people at arms length.  I have really benefited from the IRL connection of having those people in my life, allowing myself to be vulnerable and connected.

Me, alone, in my head is a dangerous place.  I tried to out think addiction for years, looking for the book, article, or self-help practice that would fix me.  Today, I stick with a few basic, tried and true attitudes and practices that keep me grounded and content.  Gratitude, mindfulness, a simple spiritual practice centered on love, and regular AA attendance and engagement.  I can't do this alone, and it keeps getting better when I keep showing up, just for today, and do the next right thing.

A recovery friend sent me a great quote today.  Don't chase the butterfly.  Mend your garden, let the butterfly come.  Today I try to live a humble, grateful, mindful life, and it seems the simpler I keep things, the richer my life becomes.  This great paradox has inspired me, and I find myself happy, joyous, and free - well, a lot of the time, life is still lifey, I am human, but fuck, is life better now.",3

IT is not Necessarily Magical,"My favorite quote: ""Knowledge comes from others.  Wisdom comes from experience.  Genius is their Unison.""  Our respective journeys are recorded here and evidence the veracity of this sage adage.

I blamed Alcohol for everything wrong in my life!  BUT....  I am still broke, but I'm not drinking. I still don't have a good job, but I'm not drinking and trying to get a new position.  I still overeat, but I'm exercising.  I still don't have a nice partner, but I'm not smoking cigarettes either now.  I still feel fat and undesirable, but I'm completing big endurance challenges (half marathon this weekend).  Anyway, was alcohol the only problem with my life?  No, but it is a BIG impediment to solving the problems.

I have relapsed, and I blamed a ""trigger""...AA would have me blame my self.  I've been Quitting since I was 18, and I made it 4 months last year before that Trigger punctured my equilibrium...now I can sufficiently address the trigger!  The Triggers are the people or situations that are the same as your addiction... They don't care about your achievements...only that you feed their egotism and make excuses for their maltreatment of YOU!  

Learn from others whether that be in groups, books, online, and/or other sources.  You will find your Path among the roads to successful lives without a poison to dull/fill the voids along your journey!  You will find community amongst those you ignored as a drinker; you will find appreciation in the mundane; you will be your best when you are not suffering from a body aching for a ruinous end; you will fall in love eventually with the person you are becoming!  

The Path is not easily traversed, but you will learn the ropes and be a helpful guide along the Way as you encounter people who have tried passages, encountered monsters, slashed demons, rolled backwards, and failed to move forward...your story matters, and your life matters!  Please, please know that WE ALL FAILED BEFORE, and success is born from our respective commitment to be our best possible selves.

I don't know.

Life with W had been turbulent because of my drinking. We lived in 7 different places over the course of his 13 years. But for the last 5, we lived in the same house. Sobriety made stability possible.

I also have three other much younger cats. They've *never* seen me drunk, or smelled smoke on me, and I am very proud of that. I want their whole lives to be as stable as W's last few years.

Just thought it was really nice that he picked up a general, alcohol-related souvenir for all his friends and coworkers, but thought to get me something a little different because it could make me uncomfortable and he wanted to take my sobriety into account.

I got an AirBnB in the city for my best friend and I for her birthday. She’s been really supportive about me quitting drinking, although apparently that’s only when my boyfriend is around. She was there when I was drinking first thing in the morning and she was there when I combined a bottle of wine with a full cup of vodka and used that to wash down an entire bottle of my antipsychotics. She called me out when she noticed I was drunk 24/7. I put her through hell when I ended up in the ICU on life support. I feel terrible about what I put her through, then the other weekend she has the audacity to say to me, “I hope you’ll drink again someday, you really enjoyed drinking.” 

It absolutely shook me. Of course I want to drink again but should I? Absolutely fucking not. I told her I couldn’t drink ever again because of how I used alcohol in my suicide attempt and she sort of understood but I could tell she’s still super sad that she doesn’t have me to get shit faced with anymore. 

I’ve told her a million times that I don’t mind going to bars with her, with me she’s got a DD for life. I still like the atmosphere of some places and thanks to CBD being super popular where I live I can still “partake” at least in some way. I can handle the urges when I have the support of the people I’m with. Everyone in my life knows that I have a family history of severe alcoholism, my mom drank herself to death by my 17th birthday. That I’ve had my own problems and that I now identify as a recovering alcoholic. 

When she left our AirBnb I tore the place apart looking for the “complimentary bottle of wine” that was supposed to be left in our apartment but thankfully was never restocked.  

I hadn’t had the urge to drink like this since I quit. Her telling me that I should made me want to so bad. The feeling I had in my gut at that moment told me that I really fucking shouldn’t. 

I love my best friend so much but this process of recovery is really fucking lonely and it sucks not to have her support.",18

Cheers sis
I kept my cool with my sister and told her thank you for letting me know how much I count for you and that I would not be helping her anymore, I had to cancelled so many AA meetings and time with my sponsor because I was helping her out with her kids, being a free nanny/maid and she knew, it gals me to know that even though I have spoken with her many times about my addiction, my depression my anxiety, she just threw all at my face because she could not apologise and recognise the fact that she was wrong on a small thing. 

Anyway, comes to the talk with my mum and I swear I thought I was in some kind of parallel universe when she said to me first ""why do you need to see your sponsor every week, are you sleeping with her?"" Yes mum I become lesbian overnight.... and ""why can't you just stop drinking, is it that maybe you dont really want too?""
I was floored like woow really? 
But instead of getting emotional I just told her that :
1 if I could stop I would have already, not for her or my sis but for myself!! 
2 I have been going to therapy and meetings, well when I could and that there is no magic solution. It's a process but for me to get better I need to go to meetings, I need support
 3 that I am done with their bullshit, I am going to be as selfish as them and put myself first as I can see none of them have any kind of empathy for anything that is not them and their life. 

I am still kinda shocked, because I have spoken with my mum about my addiction and my depression and what I needed to do, I thought she understood that I was doing my best at getting better. I cant completely blame her as it is not in our culture to drink, it took her time to understand that depression could not be cured by only praying.....
however it does not stop the hurt I feel. 
I am proud that I did not get emotional, crying and angrily shouting as I usually end up, I felt the hurt but I kept talking to her in a normal voice. 
It is not the first time I am realising I'm the only that care so much in my family, as I am the oldest of 4 and the one to raise them as my mum was working, I was always telling myself give them time they will grow they will realise they will come to....but this time it was like a click in my head. I am done waiting on them, they grown ass people the youngest is 23 year old, how long more will I have to wait?! 
I am not cutting them off my life, but I will start living MY life for myself. I will define MY boundaries high and if they want to be part of MY life they will have to respect them and me, no more free labor, no more cancelling plans, no more feeling guilty for doing things for me, no more ruining relationships for them. 

Sorry It was soo long and turned into a rant but honestly I feel lighter like a weight has been lifted off!! 
My drinking got better, I had long days, weeks of being sober but then it turns into 1 day binge whenever I was getting frustrated or emotional, which I am working on now and I believe this was a step in the right direction I maybe needed them to be so blatantly selfish I dont know, what I do know is that I will not drink today.",9

I'm 26F, I started drinking alot since mid 2017 though it's amazing how fast it takes you to get addicted!

In 2017 to 2018,i drank almost everyday, it was all fun then, I woke up feeling like shit but no embarrassment or guilt, when I talked to my party buddies we would just laugh at the stuff we did the night before.

About very late in 2018 to early 2019,i started to have lots of issues with my mental health then drinking become a huge problem though I've started to drink less than before about 2 or 4 times a week. My boyfriend is so not happy with that though he is drinking with me mostly, I don't drink at home I only drink when I'm out.

I've been trying to stop drinking for a year now but the longest I can keep it is 2 weeks and that's just a couple of times during those 2 weeks, it's hard not to drink as I live in a city where almost literally the only entertainment is either bars/restaurants or shopping malls.

Money would've been a big motivation to stop drinking but I never pay for my drinks, very very very rarely, my friends are all well off and they know I'm broke so they never let me pay.


It's day 4 now and it's 1am, earlier at 7pm I so want to drink but opted to cook at home instead. I so can't wait for it to be like 4 or 5pm later to hit the bar and drink!

Any encouraging words? Thank you!",3

My father passed away in October of 2018 and I started drinking more than I should. In January of 2019, I got into a bit of trouble for a bad mistake while blackout drunk.

My father’s best friend who has been sober for 10 years sat me down the morning after my mistake and had a long conversation with me. He asked me this question over and over again until it was drilled into my brain.

I decided no- it probably doesn’t add value. After 13 months of being sober- I can honestly say now that alcohol actually decreased the value of my life. My regret rate has dropped to almost 0%, my weekends are longer, I’m healthier, probably added years to my life, less fights with friends/gf and i could go on and on.

So ask yourself- “does alcohol add value to my life?” And think hard about the answer. I found it most certainly does not, and hopefully you can come to the same conclusion. Hope everyone is having a wonderful week and stay strong my friends.",55

Nope, the cake itself was boozy as all get out, completely soaked in it.

The story of how I got recruited into AA was posted here by me a couple of years ago   https://redd.it/7uz4yz - the short version is there were naked boobies involved.  

This post is to confirm the difficulties, the internal battles, the unraveling of justification, rationalization and entitlement - and the emergence of a hitherto unknown sense of worth which led slowly and with some stumbles to long term recovery and a life filled with joy.

Posted in the relatively early days of SD, this journey is detailed here   https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/search?q=flair%3Asaturday+author%3Aslipacre&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all   and I won't repeat it here

I will say that period between now and Sept was amazing and at the same time filled with great lows as my misconceptions and outright fantasies about myself were torn and shredded by humiliation, shame, and what I saw as failure - but which was I now see my path.

NOTE: slips are dangerous, there is no guarantee we will return from any particular binge - but they are not either a reason to revile ourselves and keep from trying again.

Finally - you hear this all the time in AA ""If I can do it, so can you."" and it's true - we all struggled in the beginning.

And yes AA is not the only path.  There are others now, try one try em all - but perhaps consider AA - it is essentially free, is pretty much everywhere, and some meetings are not as dogmatic and religious as its reputation, I am still a long way from Jesusized.",34

i have gone sober before for a month or so, usually a challenge between friends. that for me isn't much of an issue. my main problem is, i can never have one beer.. if i drink, i drink til i pass out, hopefully in my bed. i have no idea if i should stop altogether or just take a break but i am now willing to admit i have a problem. the fact that I'm so worried about not getting to drink again probably answers that question.

the last two days i have been able to talk myself out of getting a drink.. which is rare because usually by the time the day is done I've managed to talk myself into getting a beer or 12. right now I'm drinking cranberry juice with ice and no vodka. which tastes alcoholic for some reason anyway..

Before leaving he goes to hand me a beer from the 6pack we brought. I say no, I've got work to do. 

But the power of suggestion is a strong thing. Not long before I'm cracking a beer while settling in to do my reports.

It's quite rare that I leave a drink un-drank, particularly a first drink, so I'll take the win for the night.

I finish my work, watch some shows and finally surrender to the night and turn in. Hes still not back but that's not shocking. Best laid plans, and such.

After hours of trying to fall asleep...I'm woken up at midnight to him stumbling in.

This is my first time being on this type of work trip with him. I know he's an alcoholic and I know he drinks a lot when it's part of his job, but I dont often see him genuinely drunk.

It was sad. It was scary - in more of an eerie/foreboding way, like, seeing someone who is usually less inebriated than you not having their faculties about them. Not being able to conduct themselves the way they usually do. It was just so unsettling.

Of all the book reading, mental exercising, convincing, justifying, logic-using that I've done to try and break this habit, last night was probably the most effective thing to make me NOT want to drink with you today.",3

Today marks 666 days clean and sober for me.  It hasn't always been easy and I still face challenges now and again but the longer I'm sober the easier it is to view those cravings objectively instead of being caught up in the subjective way of thinking.

I wish I could say it's all peaches and cream.  There are days where the negative voice inside my head wins, but those days are much fewer and far between.  I don't get to just jump out of bed excited every day, as I tend to be a little overcommitted which makes the day to day grind grow tedious at times.  What I can say, however, is that Im learning to love myself, and I'm finally far enough from the actions and decisions I made when I was drunk and high that I dont have to carry the weight of them every day.  They are still there, for sure, but sobriety has given me a real way to process these things and move forward from it.

I live my life to live.  I remain optimistic towards the future.  I have walked many paths and I feel as though I am finally on the one that leads me to salvation.  If I can do it, you can to.

To all those out there struggling, it gets better, and I really do mean it.  Yes, there can be a bit of a pink cloud, but even when that fades ultimately the change in our lives we create through our sobriety is a benefit to those we love, care about, and interact with, rather than something purely for ourselves.  So grateful for my sobriety, happy to be alive and not in jail, happy that I have a place to sleep that is warm, and happy to get to continue walking this long and winding road.

While I feel all these positive things happening in my life, I'm still being dragged down by my inability to get back to work.

Part of my reason for getting sober was that I had been fired from my 9-5 job about a year ago while I was still actively drinking. Throughout my career I was basically a ""functioning"" alcoholic, which resulted in poor work performance, lateness, and basically just not climbing the corporate ladder that your supposed to be climbing in order to see increases in responsibilities + salary. I'm worried that my drinking / poor work performance may have tarnished my reputation, which is frustrating while I look for work again with a clear and sober mind. It's frustrating because I know I'm capable of being a lot better  employee now that I'm sober but feel like my past as a functioning alchy is holding me back. 

This has lead me to think I need to completely switch gears and go down a different career path, but that is also scary at 32 years old. Just wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences with getting your career back on track once you finally got sober.",11

Of course I couldn´t resist when I got days off, drank every day and felt complete shit instead of recovered.

I also kept telling myself that I will break the cycle eventually on my own. But last month has been worse than ever. I couldn´t find the energy in the morning to go to work, so I took vacation just so I could drink even more. 

I also ignored my phone, my parents got worried and went to my place. I told them everything. Of course they were shocked at first, but they are also super supportive. 

I can´t believe I didn´t tell anyone earlier about my situation, but I think the shame I felt all the years prevented me from doing so. I just hope it isn´t too late. 

Well, I will start seeing a psychologist soon. But I already feel like things are getting better. I ""only"" drank last Friday and Saturday and managed to stay sober on Sunday. Went to the gym yesterday and slept a whole 6 hours last night. Woke up refreshed today and will hit the gym later after work again.

The past couple of mornings have been so peaceful. I'm up and showered in time to enjoy some coffee and a few minutes to myself. I'm done getting ready before I have to wake up my oldest to get ready and catch the bus. She has plenty of time to get ready, and we've had some time to chat about what the day holds for both of us.

My husband isn't waking up to a sour puss of a wife. The tone of the day isn't set to a negative one. We gave eachother a really nice hug and kiss before we both walked out the door with time to spare. It's been really nice.

I've been the first one at the office this week. I'm not bitching at the sun for being to bright on my way in. I'm listening to music again instead of cursing myself for the night before in a drab silence.

Slow wake ups beat anxiety ridden 3am wake ups every time. 

The morning is wonderful when you're not hungover. 

There's plenty of normal things that induce self-loathing- alcohol doesn't need to add to it.

I can socialise without 10 drinks under my belt. 

Going to work without a hangover is more pleasant than going to work with a hangover. 

According to my body- it doesn't need sleep anymore

My husband and daughter are much more endearing when I'm sober- I was genuinely concerned about that one. 

I used to get constant UTI'S- haven't had one in 4 weeks, I'm assuming because I'm well hydrated. 

Apparently I never needed alcohol to remind myself of all my short-comings, however the way I do it now is far removed from the way drunk me did it.

Reading is more relaxing than wine.

I can sit in my own company and not 'need' a drink.

I can sit with scary emotions and remain sober.

Sober isn't as scary as I thought it would be.

Last one- I like sober me, 100x more than I like drunk me",139

I walked in the door into the kitchen and my Daughter was getting ready to head out and we hugged and said good evening as we do, and she said, ""mmm, you smell good"".

Now, I was wearing my hunting jacket which MUST have some old squirrel guts and snot on it, so I'm sure it wasn't that I smelled ""good"", it's that I didn't smell gross from beer and cigarettes.

Thanks for all of your posts, this thread has been my motivator for quite sometime. My drinking has improved since the summer-- I was drinking nearly every night to fall asleep and binge drinking 2-3 days of the week. Now I am completely sober every day of the week but when the weekend hits... I start back to 0. It doesn't feel like an improvement when I wake up on Sunday with a massive hangover and back with the same anxieties I've been trying to avoid by not drinking. I end up feeling like a failure and then have to start over again on Monday.

How do you guys manage the weekends without drinking? Unless I am scheduled to work the weekends, I am having trouble not drinking when the weekend hits. It seems that most social plans revolve around drinking. Plus, my boyfriend enjoys drinking still and I feel like I am ""holding him back"" by not drinking. 

Anyways, please give me some insights! I love my friends and honestly they are not bad influences-- their drinking is dialed back like 100% from mine. It seems like they can have a couple of drinks and be fine and meanwhile I need all the drinks once I start.  I don't want to feel socially isolated but I also don't enjoy feeling so sick and bad about myself after drinking.

Any tips would be amazing! Thanks for all of the support on this thread.",9

Now since a 2 years I quit the weed. And after this new year I was so fucked up from drugs and drinking I decided to quit. I don't smoke cigs anymore, no more coke or ketamine. Been working out regularly... 

But I feel depressed and I am in a dark place right now. I have to study alot and work with clients as a social worker. But I feel as I am slipping mentally as I am feeling better psychically.

Any stories to make me feel better and hang on? Will this get better? I feel like a failure as a social scientist and social worker not finding these answers myself but I feel like I need some community love or something.

It seems I’ve been drinking a lot more the last couple of months. At least once or multiple times a week getting quite drunk and always feeling lousy the next day. Telling myself I’m going to stop but then feeling down or really anxious and getting cravings for it, sometimes having holes in my memory. I make excuses like I’m weaning myself off it or a few pints won’t hurt, but i nearly always over do it and it always hurts the next day.  Not to mention smoking when I’m drunk.  

I guess I like the company of other bar goers even if I don’t talk to them. Sitting reading my phone or having headphones on while on a nice, warm drunk buzz. 

I also work part time in a bar so it’s difficult after a long day and you see people having fun and your stressed and tired and someone buys me a pint at the end of my shift. I don’t want to be rude and refuse and seem like the dry guy, but maybe that’s an excuse to get drunk.",5

Today is a good morning although I have to go to an aunt's funeral, already old, so as we say in my country, "" she rested"". Last Friday I had to go to a three-hour course in another city and after a month of solving work problems, medical and no time for me, I was overcome with anxiety and became ill. So I canceled the course, which is a possibility for me to work and I have to do it on my own (less chance of passing the test) and I was paralysed after 18 months of abstinence, doing things right and achieving goals. On Sunday night I felt like getting drunk, so I took a short walk and went to the bar to watch some football and asked for my 0.0 beer. Yesterday it was time to go to the morgue and today I returned to the gym to lift weights, tomorrow I have another test that I think I will not get sick and although I follow a reality show about beers on TV, at the moment I am still faithful to my non-alcoholic beer.

Daily I put my life into order, knowing which are the priorities. (WFS acceptance statement, #8)*

I'm so disappointed in myself. The last week of January I felt like I had an amazing breakthrough. I stopped drinking. I opened up to my husband and some of my friends about what I was going through and that I needed help. I came home every day and fought powerful afternoon urges by cleaning, crocheting, going to coffeeshops to work, walking my dog. It was hard, but it was a good week. I even made it through the weekend. But it was hard and I kept thinking, ""how will I ever get to 1 year, 5 years, 30 years, etc."" I was overwhelmed with sadness when I was thinking that I'd never get to taste a nice red wine ever again. I felt like I was punishing myself like someone would a kid that can't control themselves- by totally restricting. I got so caught up in these thoughts that I just did it again.

I hid a box of wine in my office and drank before my husband got home every day last week. I went out to a beer garden with the same friends I'd opened up to and drank. My husband asked how I was doing with abstaining, and I lied and said I'm doing great. The way I'm feeling reminds me a lot of how frustrated I was in my math classes in high school. I would try, it was too hard, I gave up and studied things that were easier. Maybe not the best analogy because studying history didn't slowly poison me to death...but, alas.

I can't help but think that today I'm only starting to hold myself accountable because I'm off to my regular therapy appointment where I've also only recently opened up about drinking. I'm embarrassed and I'm ashamed that I have so much trouble when things get tough. But, I've been working through plenty of tough stuff in therapy and know that it is possible to overcome it- but boy is it hard!

Yesterday on the daily pledge post, the reflection read something like ""take those difficult moments and turn them into learning experiences."" Its funny how I've heard and said this all the time in other situations. In therapy, at work. I'm a high school teacher for goodness sake- I live by this when it comes to my students. Today when the urges come and the anxiety wells up, I'm going to remind myself to grow from it. I'll just stay stuck in the same cycle of disappointment and guilt if I don't.",1

If you’re motivated by positive change like I was when I was reading your stories, I’m down 30ish lbs and about 12 bpm on my resting heart rate. Up around $7,000 on money not spent on booze. For those of you wondering about the new struggles, I’m consuming quite a bit more sugary stuff than ever before. Probably reversed about 5 lbs of weight loss because of it. Know I need to get that sorted out. And I’m struggling to stay active in the winter, which is frustrating after being in the gym so much during the first 8 months or so. But those seem manageable in the big picture. 

I’ve reflected a lot today and I think what I feel most is gratitude. I feel like removing alcohol from the picture has opened me up to receiving some amazing opportunities. While I’m grateful for those, I think the deeper layer is that I’m free of that demon shouting inside in my head that I need another drink, and then feeling absolute hatred toward myself for obeying it. 

I have a lot of love for this community. I would not have made it this far without you all. Keep at it wherever you are in your journey. IWNDWYT",90

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, no matter what happens—good or bad—and invite you to do the same. Maybe you're new to [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let’s not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.**

Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:**

A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [/r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn’t:**

A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

On the day I quit, I promised myself, ""I'll just take tonight off drinking..."" It's been a hundred days, tomorrow will be 101, and I wanted to make note of my journey so far. 

""Drinking doesn't solve your problems it just makes them go away..."" This joke (from *Bob's Burgers*) comes back to me pretty often. I was riddled with anxiety when I was drinking, because it constantly felt like I was just ahead of some big fuck up. There were all sorts of things going wrong, things that I felt like I was incapable of confronting, and so instead of actually facing them I would drink. It didn't really address any of my issues, but it certainly made them seem less significant. Of course, because I wasn't dealing with them, these problems kept getting worse, and I just kept drinking. Drinking didn't solve my problems, it just made them go away.

Now that I'm a little ways past it, I've realized that a lot of my journey toward sobriety is about reclaiming a sense of agency and a capacity to face the challenges in my life. It hasn't always been easy; there have been several times when the temptation to just drink and shut my brain off for a while was hard to manage. But in moments when I get that psychological itch, I remind myself of all the things that I can get out of not drinking. That feeling of panic, being broke before payday and not knowing what I'm going to drink, I don't have to have that anymore. I don't have to wake up with a headache, wondering what I might have said the night before. Hell, I've lost 15 lbs, just from not drinking a six-pack a night anymore. I think about all of the things that I have access to while living sober, and I want all of those things more than I want to get drunk.

Of course, in the time I've been typing this, we've crossed over into midnight in my timezone, so for anyone who has read this far, I want to say thanks. This sub has been a big help in encouraging me to go this far down the path. I will not drink with you today.",7

How the hell did I end up here? I drank like a fish for decades, tried everything I could to stop, and failed miserably time after time.  

I needed help, and the first place I found it was right here, on r/stopdrinking. I gotta admit, for the longest time, I browsed this subreddit with the mouse in my right hand and a glass in my left. Just the same, I saw how much compassion and support could be found here, and how willing people were to share advice and guidance.  

For me, it wasn't enough, so I decided I needed some real-time, real world help. I decided to try AA, and if that didn't work, I was headed for rehab, or therapy, or both. Fortunately for both me and my wallet, AA took hold. Had me a dandy little relapse in 2013, but came out of it.  

You can, too. You can do this. Look, if a degenerate piss-tank like me can pull it off, so can you. Here's what I did.  

- I recognized that I was sick. I wasn't weak-willed, or stupid, or morally deficient. I was sick, pure and simple. It wasn't my fault.  

- I admitted that alcohol had got the better of me, and that I can't control my drinking, as much as I would like to think I can. I tried, and tried, and everything I tried didn't work.  

- I realized that if I were to survive, I needed help. I'd be dead if I hadn't quit. My health was headed downhill fast. So I had to get help.  

- AA's 4th Step was an introspection of the factors that were leading me to drink in the first place. It identified the holes I was trying to fill with booze. They were pretty much loneliness and isolation, with a touch of low self-esteem thrown in to spice things up. And ego. I was the world's worst piece of shit, but I was better than everyone else...if that makes any sense.  

- I engaged with sober people, asked them for advice, and listened to them. Basically, I joined the club. They knew things I needed to learn.  

- I got my shit together....sort of. It may not have been assembled, but at least it was all in the same box. At that point, I had developed some sober time and a bit of credibility. That's when I apologized for the messes I had made.  

- I kept going. It was tough at times, especially at first, but one thing I found was that the fight didn't get easier, I got *stronger*. My head cleared, my demeanor brightened, my health recovered, and things got better all around. This wasn't an immediate change, it took a while, but it seemed that every time I looked back, I was amazed at how different my life had become.  

Come and join me. You can do it. Treat yourself with compassion and forgiveness, set aside this fearful poison, and move forward into a life that's so good it's hard to imagine.  

Sobriety will bring the world to you and lay it at your feet. It's yours, you deserve it, and nobody can deny it to you, except yourself. End this cycle, and transform into the happy person you were meant to be.  

59,999 hours and 56 minutes. I never thought I would be here, but I am.  

And you can, too.

#2 - Drinking in moderation is not an option for me.

I can finally see my reflection in the magic mirror. I am an alcoholic. Maybe I was born one. Maybe I became one over time. The “why” and “how” do not matter. I am now an alcoholic. There is no going back to being a regular person. I crossed to the other side. I either drink myself to death or I remain sober. There is no place in-between the truth and the fairy tale.

Sure, I could moderate for a while. I’ve done it a million times. But in two months, or six months, or in a year ... I’d eventually turn a couple drinks into a full-on drunkfest. That’s what happened the last relapse. No drinks in a few days. I rewarded myself with a margarita, which turned into three margaritas, which turned into shots with a random bar patron I “befriended” at a dive bar. Then, of course, drunk driving over 30 miles. The next day around 2 pm, the shakes started. Full blown withdrawal. It wasn’t a hangover. It was kindled withdrawal.

It took me 18 years to get here. I didn’t start drinking until I was 22. And even after becoming a bartender, I remained a moderate drinker until 26 or 27. After that, the afterwork bar benders started. 

I see now I started suffering mild withdrawal a few years ago when I quit for a few days. About a year ago I suffered moderate withdrawal. I quit for six or so months after because it scared me, then lied to myself that what I experienced wasn’t *really* withdrawal (even though my right arm went numb and I didn’t sleep for three days). I moderated for a while. But yet again, I ended up going big instead of going home. And the withdrawal hit me like a ton of bricks. Ended up tapering over five days to avoid shakes and convulsions. I hid out in a hotel after my taper as I was scared shitless someone would find out or that I would have a seizure and I’d be far from a hospital. So I got a room next to the nearest hospital in case things went south. Lied to everyone. Told different stories to different people about where I was. Par for the course, since addicts are amazing liars. 

I’m done lying to myself. I never want to feel like that again.

Now I am sober and... Everyday I don't drink everyday I don't give in. So weird.

I remember feeling so weak to alcohol. I knew that everyday I would drink. I would have that conversation every day ""okay I am really not going to drink today, be strong. I got this."" Only to later buy a twelve pack of truly and a bottle of rum for my husband. We would drink and chill. Not really doing anything just drinking and playing video games and watching TV. Oh and also not remember in the morning.

I would always wake up and think what did I eat last night.  Especially if my stomach was upset, which was most of the time.

Life so far at most times has been hard...There were a lot of times that I didn't care if I ever stopped drinking or smoking. Times of deep sadness and loss. And only now that I am out of it can I see how alcohol fueled that very same sadness for so many years.

I feel so strong now. Like damn why did I even drink. I don't need it. 

Now I go to the grocery store at 2 am because I am not drunk. I get real sleep. My dogs are even happier. 

All I am trying to get at is that I am so thankful that I was able to quit. Everyday I heal. My mind is awake after years of haze. 

It's weird that quitting drinking feels like one of my biggest accomplishments. I did it! Go me 🎉

No, I wasn't going to get violent with her. I'm just a dumb fuck.

I went nearly 2 yrs without drinking from Oct 2017 to July 2019, but over the past 6+ months, I've gotten drunk constantly. I gained quite a bit of weight, too. Ugh...

Anyway, here we go again. I ended my 20's being an alcoholic. I'm going to make sure I don't waste my 30's doing the same.

Edit to add: My brother told me a few minutes ago that I got into an argument with him last night and punched him in the face twice. Smh. I apologized and he told me, “It was embarrassing. People were staring at us. You’ve gotta stop drinking.”

Back in October I decided to quit and I went about two months without drinking. I was surprised -- it didn't feel nearly as difficult as I thought it would. Of course I feel into the trap of ""huh maybe I'm not actually addicted"" so I started drinking again. At first it was just occasionally, but now it feels worse than ever before. I'm drinking large quantities more frequently. I'm drinking during the day. Today I drank at work for the first time ever. 

I'm thinking about taking some time off work to focus on my sobriety. Everything seems to be triggering me right now and making me want to drink. I feel like I need to focus on just resting, going to AA, and exercising. My boss is generally a pretty understanding guy, and I thought about just telling him that I'm dealing with some mental health issues. Between school, work, and my addiction I'm just feeling so overwhelmed right now. Has anyone taken time off in the beginning? Any thoughts on this idea? 

It's hard for me to not feel like a lazy fuck-up. I'm ashamed that I've gotten to a point where I feel like I need to do this. But I'm afraid of what will eventually happen to me if I don't start making my sobriety my #1 priority.",3

I have a diagnosed sleep disorder, so not all my issues are because of liquor, but I can’t seem to get over the hump of not being able to sleep and being constantly worried I’m going to pass out in public/at work, due to not getting any shut eye... 

I have been “going sober” on and off since August (on birthday actually), where I had some kind of benzo to help with withdrawals (I was drinking 1/5th per day for about 3 months), and my new doc said he wouldn’t prescribe me benzos bc of past alcohol abuse, but I think he forgot after a couple months and eventually prescribed me one... I’m scared to talk to him about this, in fear he won’t give me medication to help, as Japan doesn’t really take alcoholism/mental health very seriously. 

I guess does anyone have tricks for how you get over just wanting to be asleep all the time? I get kick ass lucid dreams, so it’s not like I just want to go to sleep to be dead to world, but my anxiety and newly lackluster/jaded view of the world doesn’t see the point in participating 🤷🏼‍♀️",3

My eyes were heavy with the weight of my own actions.

12 years of drinking myself into oblivion had taken its toll.

Drinking is a deeply personal thing, but for me, it wasn't working any more.

I was overweight, selfish, and lazy.

I had barely scraped by my 20s, and the only thing I lived for was myself and the next drink. I had shattered my life, my future, and myself into being at my own personal bottom.

1,000 days ago I was exhausted.  My heart was heavy, and I was tired of being selfish, sarcastic, living a caustic lifestyle. I was calcified in my anger, my victim mentality, and was not even sure I wanted to live anymore.

Somewhere in the depths of a blackout, I decided to stop.

I took agency of my life, asked for help, and got honest about who and what I was.

I called my mentor and asked him to drop me off at a detox facility.

I stumbled out three days later.

I jumped into action helping others.

I cleared the wreckage of my past (and continue to do so).

I try to do the next right thing.

I humble myself and stop trying to run the show.

I didn't mean to find God, get spiritual, go vegan, or always be willing to help others. But when I put the drink down, I found I grew, I prayed, and I meditated, and I learned. I continue to do so, and look back on this picture that first month of sobriety, and realize I was just starting out on this journey.

It's more fulfilling to help others than help yourself. I've learned it's about consistency over intensity. Everyday waking up, making the bed, doing a meditation, journaling, and working out. These little micro actions change the macro, and I wake up today more blessed and fulfilled than I have ever been.

I get to be a present father, partner, and employee

I get to pray over my new born son every day and be entirely in the moment, no matter how tiring it is.

I get to daily practice gratitude and stay positive.

I love you all, and I'm grateful to be here today.

1,000 days ago I wasn't sure if I wanted to keep living, but I'm glad I did.

1,000 days ago I took my last drink.

We all have our struggles, addictions, bad habits, flaws, and things we want to change about ourselves. These things are a lot harder to change by ourselves. There is hope, there is freedom from the obsession, and there is beauty on the other side. The real, raw thing is we can connect, we can be aware, we can love, nurture, and help each other. We are in this together, and if we can admit our need, we can win.  Let's get active in our own rescues.

Things that have come back into my life:

1. A stable job.

2. A relationship with my parents and brothers that is healthy.

3. A car that I make on time payments on.

4. A healthy and non codependent relationship with someone who is also sober.

5. My health.

A lot of things have come back into my life and life is not always birthday cakes and blow jobs. I can tell everyone this, I no longer fear my phone. That feeling inused to get when my phone rang of pure fear is all but subsided. The fear that it is a creditor, a friend that is mad, a family member checking up on me, all of that is gone. I can walk through life with my head held high and for the first time a sense of peace and serenity knowing that things will be the way that they are and that's ok. If this is your first day, or your first decade, just remember you only have to stay sober 24 hours at a time. Surround yourself with people that understand you, and stay open to what they did to keep themselves sober. We all have a different path and I am so grateful for this community.

Side note: If you’re reading this and think you need to go to a Dentist but you’re anxious: Google your local dentist, email them saying you’re nervous on account of neglect and heavy drinking and would like to make an appointment - they’re all super nice - and remember they see people with *no teeth*. 51% of people have a missing tooth, and fillings are a fact of life and getting older.

That basically stopped me from going right then as I let it sit and thought more about it, but honestly the temptation was still there.

Saturday, i literally slept until 5 at night because i couldnt sleep the night before at all, and by sleep i mean toss and turn for hours on end.  Sunday, i knew i had things to do, but having slept til 5 the previous day i couldnt sleep again so i set an alarm for 4 pm at the latest i would get up.  i was actually surprisingly productive for a few hours then back to the couch for reddit and more isolation. 

ONTO TODAY: today has been so fucking weird.  i didnt sleep again last night til about four am, knowing i had court this morning for a revoked drivers license just kept my mind racing.  worrying about how i was gonna get there, how the case was gonna go, yadda yadda.  and of course my alarm goes off and its an instant FUCK, i need more sleep.  but i got out of bed, and went outside for a smoke.  we had sun for the first time in a while today. the cool crisp air, the cig, the sun, it just felt ok and for the first time in a long time i felt good this morning.  got my shit together and went to the bus.  having to be in court in less than 20 min (my fucking lyft driver cancelled my ride while i was getting dressed, he was still 10 fucking min away) the bus gave me a heart attack when it ran 5 min late.  BUT, i made it.  great news is that all charges are dropped to basically a parking ticket and i was fucking ecstatic. had to wait another hour for the next bus to take me back home but i was still riding that high so it didnt really get to me that much.  as i got home (remember how i said i really didnt sleep last night? yeah well a ton of bricks hit me in the head when i walked through the door into my apt) i layed down and fought every urge to stay awake.  i have to get my doctors appointment at 2 and if i passed out then id be out for good. and maybe even miss my night class tonight as well.  so i fought through and made it there too.  but after feeling totally fine this morning no stomach issues or headaches or burning up, as soon as i walk in im like a hundred degrees, and my stomach is in knots. now i havent eaten much in the last six days (stupid i know, but everytime i look at food it just makes me want to throw it back up) so i was also feeling a little light headed.  it was like the span of 30 seconds i went from fine to feeling like i did on day 2 again.  i get in and i have to see a new person because shes the only one available, and she proceeds to take  kind of a snippy attitude with me.  i specifically came to the doc today to ask about vivotrol shots and she flat out was like youd have to ask psych.  well when can i see them? theres a three month waiting list.  are you fucking kidding me? and no one on site is trained to give it so id have to drive 40 miles when i dont have a car or drive. finally i just say look, i am on day six of a detox and my b1 and potassium levels are probably way out of line, and she looks at me and says and? so i literally had to ask for my blood test to check them.  finally when i did get home i realized i didnt have any food so i had to run to the closest spot which is my liquor store so i could at least buy peanuts (high in B1 if anyone was wondering, still looking for some bananas for potasium) and im walking there grumbling how much of a waste of time this all was and how if i had just stayed home i could have slept for like 5 hours before my night class.  so here i sit having gone from one of those mornings where you just feel like its gonna be cool, to now where im grumpily eating peanuts waiting for my night class to start so i can go, get it overwith, come home, do a quick assignment, and hopefully fucking finally get some sleep.

It's always in the back of my head but the voice is much louder today. The thought of not being able to have celebratory champagne or beer at my upcoming wedding this Summer is especially hard to think about. I have dabbled with some non-alcoholic beverages and I know they make non-alcoholic wines and champagnes but obviously drinking O'Douls or even non-alcoholic IPAs do not hit the same as having 900+ calories  of craft beer every day.

The only thing that stops me from drinking is remembering how bad my anxiety levels were. I still struggle with anxiety and OCD but that terrible ""fight-or-flight"" feeling I have has gone down a ton. If it weren't for that and all the money and effort I am putting into my mental health, i'd still be drinking a 6-pack every day, easy.

I think today might just be harder because I am experiencing a great amount of fatigue, which I have read is a common withdrawal symptom (even a month into being sober) and general sadness at the reality of my situation. After years of being in denial of my drinking problem, it is just sad and lonely to realize I can't just have one or two drinks during social events like everyone around me. For me, 1 to 2 social drinks at night turns into drinking beer at work at 10am and not stopping until I go to sleep that night.

 I know that I used alcohol in order to avoid uncomfortable feelings. I just want to be able to be okay with myself as I am. I normally have fairly high confidence in myself, at least outward-facing...I just feel like I could use some words of encouragement from this community. It's hard to deal with this when I don't want to tell people about my drinking problem and my attempt at being sober. It's also hard to be held accountable when everyone around me is continuing to live their normal lives and I feel like so much energy of my day is spent on just being okay with myself and maintaining my sobriety. 

I just want to be normal but I feel like a fucking loser. I want to give myself some compassion but I also cannot help but over-analyze my situation and choices. It is times like these where I want to say ""fuck it,"" and drink and continue to avoid these uncomfortable feelings. I guess it just feels like an extreme choice either way (sobriety or unhealthy drinking habits) and it feels overwhelming.

My underlying plan was to stop at the mini Mart around the corner to pick up a tall can of beer to drink by myself in the garage. Knowing damn well but SO would not approve. So much so that she went and hid the bottle of tequila from the night before... Yes it's gotten that bad.

As I was coming up on the mini mart I really started thinking just how blessed I am.. to be driving my ""summer"" car (as if one good car isn't enough) - I waffled about four times before finally deciding to just keep driving. I drove right by, turned the corner, pulled the car back into the garage, took a deep breath, came inside and just stared at my partner. She didn't notice but at that moment I felt thankful and grateful for everything.

I was thankful that for whatever reason I made the right decision at that moment. Its been very hard for me to try and moderate or even tell myself to stop completely but I'm really starting to see the glory in these small wins. Even if not consistent. I'm trying.

* This was a really small meeting.  I was one of 5 so they went around the table and when it came to me, they said, ""You're up.""  So I didn't feel like I had the option of just listening at my first meeting like a lot of folks here have described.
* I was also encouraged to read a passage in praise of God and I'm not religious so that felt weird.
* I think the verbiage is a little antiquated.  I don't think being unable to moderate makes me ""powerless.""  I don't think I have a disease.  I think in avoiding thinking about past trauma, I used an addictive substance and (surprise!) became addicted to it.
* Those things aside, it was nice to have physical people to talk to who understood what I was feeling and the level of understanding and sincere caring and empathy that they showed me felt genuine and like I was making a connection with these people.  I think I can set aside the religious aspects, which felt procedural, and just filter them as such for myself.
* I'd like to try different meetings which might be larger and more tailored to my needs, but this is pretty much the only one I can get to for now. So I'm not sure I'll go every week, but this experience nets positive for me and I'm open to going again.",13

A mere few weeks into sobriety my shifts at work have become... nothing!
I shrug the work day off like it never happened, relax at home for a couple of hours and fall easily into a deep comfortable sleep.

I drink daily (often all day) and cannot stop … but I  ""moderated"" to only drink beer and rarely blackout, never drive drunk or do dangerous things … It's hard to get hammered on beer.  Basically, I sleep a lot and am very, very depressed … but I'm functioning albeit at nowhere near full capacity.  It's killing my body.

I've gone to AA sporadically, never tried meds …

A loved one is 3 weeks out of rehab for alcohol and doing great.  He completely screwed up his life and would be dead.  He got all of his in one place - counseling, AA, recreation, medication as necessary, weeks of intensive outpatient therapy. He got that all in one place, through insurance … and got short term disability, as well.  It put him solidly on a wellness track, it seems.

I feel like for me, I'd need AA … a therapist .. a new primary care doctor … a new neurologist … and a visit to a non-alcoholic retreat center.

Is it overkill or frowned upon to go to rehab in my scenario?  I have great insurance.

Thanks in advance.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I have had three talks with the folks at my preferred rehab.  Initially, I was irritated by the first dispatcher(?)'s  refusal to assure me that I could book a bed when I need it … ""I can only reserve beds 24 hours in advance.""   When my loved one went in there, there was this same hard sell... but when he was there it was only at about half capacity - he didn't have a roommate, and it was remarkably empty … so I was  a little peeved.   I really don't want to travel father than this rehab, so I'm not going anywhere else.

Fast forward to today … I had two long conversations with them and they understand my situation and timeline.  It will cost me my out of pocket maximum (not awful) for two weeks of inpatient and however much outpatient is needed. I told them I cannot go until mid-March.  They will be checking in with me weekly. 

 This is how it should work. Thank  you to this subreddit for being the only place on the planet where I could formulate this plan so easily.  Love to all.",5

I was a heavy drinker for probably the last 6 years.  It was a habit I had from senior year of high school, into college, into my 20's, now sitting at 32 I decided it was time to quit.  I hit rock bottom.  Drove on a flat tire to get alcohol.  Fixed said tire the next day in the pouring rain to get alcohol because my girlfriend wouldn't let me use her car to go to the gas station.  I was a mess destroying relationships left and right.  Not caring about the people that were closest to me.  Not caring for my daughter the way I should have.  So I quit.  With help from a close couple of friends I went cold turkey.  The first week was hell.  Withdrawls, cravings, urges, mood swings.  I was miserable and I thought going back to drinking was the only thing to feel better.  I stayed sober drank way too much pop and energy drinks.  A lot of snacks (which I never drank or ate like that before).  Week 2 was easier and week 3 I felt like myself again.  It hasn't been a hard road still have had my share of cravings and urges which I feel is normal, which brings us to last night.  All weekend I had the urge to get a 6 pack of my favorite beer.  I'd been sober 20 days not having an issue with it.  I felt like I deserved it.  I contemplated for 2 hours and finally got in the car after an energy drink and a shower.  I felt so strange standing in line with a 6 pack like I was doing something wrong, like I was going to let everyone down. I talked to my mom and my girlfriend and we all agreed it would be a good test to see if I was in the clear.  I got home and poured one in a glass and took a sip.  It was terrible, nothing like that feeling I got when I was drinking every day.  The taste, the consistency, it was horrid.  But I kept going because the first one always tastes bad right?  They all tasted terrible.  I played gta thinking getting a buzz playing some video games I've been thinking about this moment for 3 weeks!  It never came.  With every beer I felt worse and worse.  This wasnt the feeling I used to get, there was no euphoria no ""buzz"" I felt down and out of place.  I finished the 6 pack and my girlfriend jokingly said ""I'm going to get a couple twisted teas do you want more?""  I said yes.  She brought me back 2 24 oz fruity gas station drinks.  I drank them thinking it would get better.  It didnt.  I never got the feeling I was hoping for.  I never got that euphoric feeling I used to get every night getting wasted.  I didn't get anything out of it other than the sense that it wasnt for me any more.  I feel so much better every single night that I'm sober compared to any feeling I had last night and I'm so happy about that.  I dont feel like I stumbled I dont feel bad about drinking.  I felt like I needed a sober perspective of what I was getting out of it.  It's not worth it, there aren't any answers at the bottom of the bottle.  It didnt make me feel good, it didnt make me feel better, it just made me feel like shit and left me with a horrible headache today.  If your thinking about drinking I suggest taking that money and going to a movie or getting your favorite food I assure you those things will make you feel far better than anything alcohol will do for you.  Today is day one all over again and it definitely wasnt worth it.

Drinking in the mornings and passing out. Last week, my boyfriend's hours at work were low so we wouldn't be able to buy beer (10% IPAs) for the week and I went into a panic (not currently working) I started researching how I could sell my iPad Air, old Fitbit, signed up for freelance work, looked into cashing a retirement savings account. This was all Friday (Feb 7th) night. 

Saturday (Feb 8th), I was hungover as usual, and my boyfriend and I went to get some lunch. I, as usual, was not hungry and was dry heaving. He also picked up a six pack even though I insisted he get two. We went home and I kept asking him if he wanted me to go around the corner and pick up another six pack. He said no.

Still anxious about the lack of beer for the week, and having been a lurker on this page for a month or so, and it hit me like a ton of bricks.

I was dependant on this. It wasn't the need of money that motivated me to look for work; it was the fear of a lack of alcohol. Nothing else had motivated me, not even:

- no appetite for months
- vomiting every few days
- feeling disgusting 24/7
- shakes/trembles
- slight alcohol poisoning

I went to my desk, and wrote down the ""pros"" of booze. My ""pros"" were:

1. Feel good
2. It's fun

My Cons/Consequences list was FIVE pages long. I was horrified. 

It felt like the rose colored glasses came off. What was I doing?!

I've had no desire to drink since that moment. I'm currently on Day 3.

Benefits so far:

- MUCH more alert and happy; I cleaned my room and am making so much more progress
- Waking up earlier and no disgusting cotton mouth
- My appetite is coming back! These past two days, I've actually had breakfast!
- (TMI) My stool is slowly improving. No more frequent runs and seeing watery sludge
- feel so energetic

I can't believe I was in such denial. (I hope) I never go back to that!

About a week ago, I told a colleague in a conversation that did not warrant the comment ""I have a drink every night,"" she replied with ""I can't remember the last time I had a beer."" I then tried to think of the last time I went a night without alcohol. Most nights it is 2 beers or 2 glasses of wine, if I am staying up later enjoying tv it can go up to 4, this happens at most once per week. 

Writing this and before last night, I truly can't remember the last 24 hours I went without alcohol, which is starting to worry me. 

Last night I resisted the urge of having my husband buy beer and me consuming any wine or gin we have at home. I went with the simple thought of, ""it's one night, get over the habit/ritual and do something else."" So I put on a podcast and cleaned the house (honest to goodness I didn't want to sit still while convincing myself to not drink). The urge passed quickly and I enjoyed my podcast, watched tv, then went to bed... only to wake up drenched in sweat. 

No other symptoms, I'm not sick, I feel fine, no surge of energy or lethargy. But sweating at night is not normal for me. (I asked my husband if the temperature was ok last night, he said yes he wasn't hot at all) I think my body went through alcohol withdrawal. I am nervous, alcoholism runs in my family and thought I would be able to catch it sooner than showing a sign of physical dependency. 

I want to go 5 days without a drink, my husband is supportive but may cave if I ask him to bring home beer. It's not his job to keep me from drinking, it's mine. Writing this out makes it seem some much worse, but I didn't exaggerate any details, it is the reality. Sorry if I rambled, I didn't know where to start or stop.

I wish the demons in my head would just chill TF out sometimes.. it's not like my life is some horrible mess, I have it pretty good all things considered.  So idk what exactly drives me to want drugs and alcohol.. but man, sometimes it seems that's about all I have to look forward to. 

Bradley Nowell put it this way-

""Ain't nothing wrong, Ain't nothing right.. and still I sit and lie awake all night""

I did have a very intense therapy session and seemed to wake up/ perk up shortly afterwards so maybe I just had some excess negative energy that was weighing me down. 

PAWS is still in effect so I imagine the sleepiness will come and go for a while as I unravel all the trauma that led me to alcoholism.  That kind of mental work is quite taxing.

I also had a hearty and healthy meal with a virgin margarita that put a smile on my face :)

Original post: 
I understood being exhausted at first, and my energy levels got better after two months or so but I’m so tired I can barely get out of bed, having a hard time motivating myself. I’m still kind of battling depression as well. 

Just wondering if this is normal for the journey (I was a chronic severe alcoholic if that makes a difference) 

Or if I should consider that there’s something else going on. Thanks for the advice :)",11

I relapsed yesterday, but it’d been looming for a few days prior. Friday I wanted to drink, but forced myself to an AA meeting, and then to dinner with some people from the group afterwords. It sucked, because I didn’t feel like being around people, but I stayed sober. Saturday I had planned to drink, but ended up calling someone from AA and he came and picked me up so we could talk. 

After I got back from his house is when things really shifted. I felt good, I was starting to feel close to and care about people, and I was realizing that those people cared able me too. That scared me. Sobriety, AA, and my support group was something i considered disposable, but as that began to shift i freaked out. I wanted to distance myself, I wanted to be sure I mainetained my “easy way out”. I tried to sleep those feelings off, but they were just stronger the next day. 


Yesterday my mania was really nasty, I was drowning in my fears and my urge to self sabotage. I considering drinking all day. I even didn’t eat so I’d get drunker off less when/if I did drink. The last straw was the mania induced psychosis, If I was going to be so disoriented and out of my mind I wanted it to be on my own terms. I barely remember walking to the store, and I don’t remember shit about walking back. I do remember getting home and being filled with dread over the fact that it was too late to get a ride to the AA meeting that someone and offered to take me to. And I sure do remember cracking open that first gas station beer, and hurling my 24hr chip across the room. And getting drunk as I thought about the meeting I was missing. I was cocky as fuck at first, mumbling to myself about how I felt fucking great, how everyone on here and from AA were full of shit with all the “drinking will make you feel worse” shit. But that only lasted half an hour or so. It didn’t take long for the guilt, shame, and regret to sink in. 

It was really kinda scary how the one drink effected me. I was going to chug two 24oz cans then do some shots but that first drink really shut me down. I got a pain in my left side that still hasn’t gone away, I got drunker than I expected, my face was hot as hell, and I threw up before having to sit down in the shower for a while. 


I have a lot of guilt surrounding yesterday. I hid my drinking from my roomate. I lied about why I was going to the gas station, drank in my room, then brushed my teeth and washed my hands/face and said I’d been smoking weed so my behavior wouldn’t be questioned. I feel bad lying to her since her boyfriend is an alcoholic and does the same shit, I know it’s something that hurts her a lot. 


I feel really bad today. I’m depressed and my anxiety is through the roof. The worst part is all I want is a drink. I’m scared to try again. I want to keep drinking. I don’t want to talk to anyone from AA and I really don’t want to go to meetings this week. I know I should. But I’m just scared, and I’m embarrassed, and part of me wants to just keep this up. I don’t know how to move forward and I don’t know what I want. I told my sponsor I relapsed and that id talk when I was sober, but I haven’t even sent a text yet today, and I probably won’t. 

I was at 24 days, I’ve been fighting this bullshit for two years and 32 days is my record. I feel defeated. And I’m so tired of fighting.",23

Also in the evenings if I need to run to the store for something it feels almost impossible not to hit the liquor store, but by reminding myself of all the bad things and anxiety alcohol causes me I’ve been able to fight it. I have been going to 7/11 rather than my normal store since they don’t have liquor there and I’m not interested in beer or wine. I have never had this much willpower when trying to quit drinking. I haven’t hung out with any friends yet but that’s gonna be a step that’s really hard for me to not drink.

This is a great community. To give a brief background of my history abusing alcohol (I'm sure this will sound familiar) I started at a young age while in a heavy drinking culture. A family member gave me my first beer at twelve at a family gathering and for years I didn't think twice about their decision. Drank with friends and siblings on the weekends through high school, increasing more in college. Really became problematic when I moved to a mountain resort town in my mid 20's and for a few years it was so much fun, I had a good-paying job and loved meeting up with friends on the hill, always centered around getting to a spot and drinking heavily. I never saw it as an issue because I had fun instead of my natural tendency towards isolation and depression and it never screwed with my work life (or so I thought, looking back on that time I feel otherwise).

Fast forward a few years and I met and married the love of my life and we were able to buy our first house. I changed jobs and had a co-manager who had been working there much longer than I had who was a functional alcoholic. This person tolerated and actively encouraged drinking on the job, often bringing liquor and offering it. This was the point my life started going off the rails, I would drink (fairly lightly, maybe a few shots over a shift) and immediately after getting off work for the night to ""relax and wind down"" still not noticing it was problematic for me. Last year things came to a head, I would go on weeks-long benders and cracks started forming in my marriage because of it. I do not blame my S.O. in any way for this, I have been so selfish and neglectful. I was at a point where I would have whiskey before coffee and drink all day at work, get home and drink until passed out. Where is the space for love and marriage in a lifestyle like that? As our relationship started to crumble I drank more to numb the pain, and hide away because I was so ashamed of who I was becoming. Of course, this drove a wedge further between us and I became used to the idea of living a short, unhappy life due to my abuse. 

Anyway, end of last year we had a serious talk about our lives and the changes I needed to make. I started cutting back and for a time it seemed like I was on track to a better lifestyle. Over the holidays we hosted my in-laws, our house was full and everyone but me was having a great visit. having ""my"" (I'm such a selfish asshole) space occupied by other people has always been an issue for me. On X-mas eve we were all supposed to all go out for a fancy dinner. Well, I let myself get stressed and anxious about it and had a half day from work, decided I just needed a drink or two to clear my head and lessen my anxiety about it. Ended up passed out before everyone else left. It has been pretty rough going since, I spent most of January hiding in my basement, sometimes drinking, sometimes staring at the wall and beating myself up mentally. Two weeks ago I decided that I needed to stop taking it easy on myself and tackle my problems head-on.

My S.O. is incredibly disappointed with me and I feel like our marriage is on the brink. We're sleeping in separate rooms and she always just assumes that I'm drunk because she spent so many years with me drinking daily. Which brings us to now, I had a solid week of sobriety and felt great, lots of energy and mental clarity, even with horrible sleep and little appetite. Was home alone for a weekend and lapsed pretty hard, drank way too much and was wracked with guilt because I chose to be home drunk instead of at an important family event. I took stock of my situation and reminded myself where my priorities should be, have reached out to my support structure and told myself Monday would be different, back to the struggle of sobriety. I strung together another 6 days last week and over the weekend but last night cracked and bought whiskey. Drank it all over the course of a few hours and now feel horrible and un-motivated. 

My S.O. has lost all trust in me, my family I either keep my distance from due to their drinking habits or shame over my own. I feel like I can't talk about this struggle with anyone (aside from you fine folks). I'm in the process of reading this naked mind and feel like I'm getting a lot out of it. AA is not a good match for me.

I think the biggest roadblock for me lately has been not being able to sleep while not drinking. I will sleep until about 1 AM before waking up shaking, sweating, and muscle soreness. This makes my addict brain rationalize drinking the next day (maybe just one or two so you don't experience that) but don't feel like I have the resolve to taper without just drinking to excess or the time to quit before I fuck my life up even worse. Anyone with experience with withdrawal symptoms I'd be very interested to hear when they went away because it's driving me crazy to get so little sleep and having my first thought upon waking about alcohol to alleviate them. My face is red all the time, even after days of not drinking a drop, I feel like I'm wearing it like a mark of shame and everyone around me notices and knows.

How do you pick yourselves back up when you feel like you just can't break the pattern you've established? I've lost so much over drinking and need to make a change or my life is only going to continue to crumble. Well, back to day one today, I'm feeling good about staying sober for another week and longer! I poured the remaining booze in the house early this morning and reminded myself it has no value to me, only pain. Thanks for reading and any advice you can share!",7

Its time to stop for good.,"Alcohol has been part of my life since my early teens I'm 30 now . It started of as drinking with friends at party's ect ""every"" weekend drinking anything, the stronger the better. Eventually and I'm not proud of this in my early 20's it turned into bottles of vodka over the weekends which led to violence and arrests . When I was 23 I was charged with abh and rather than blaming it on drink as a whole or my own demons I blamed it on vodka. I haven't drunk vodka since and eventually as i got older my social group did the same and I no longer go out drinking to pubs or party's ect anymore . Instead my drinking has evolved into 4 beers a night  after work almost every night ""just to chill out/de stress and fall asleep "" although in all honesty I think that's just an excuse. This Friday I went out for the first time in years i lost my phone, wallet and have been told I'm no longer welcome round that old ""friends "" house. I'm depressed all the time the guilt and anxiety just feed the drinking which in turn feeds the depression/anxiety. I need to stop .

Normally, after a night out of drinking, every article of clothing I'd worn would obviously have to be put into the wash. My shirts would smell like a combination of stale sweat, cigarette smoke (I don't smoke normally, but I'd partake/lurk outside with the smokers when drunk), alcohol, and more sweat. Also stained from spilled drinks, greasy late night food, and all too often, vomit. One of my biggest cringe moments was not realizing I had dried vomit on the sleeve of my winter coat until I was in the checkout line at Costco the next day... *shudder* ...anyways.

Had a completely sober night out Saturday, and yesterday I picked the hoodie I had worn off my dresser and absentmindedly gave it a quick sniff test, preparing to toss it in the hamper, but... what's this? Sniffed again. It smells.. nice?! Faintly of my perfume and nothing else. No stains. No sour smell. I couldn't believe it! I actually was able to hang it back up in my closet. Meaning a smaller laundry pile to tackle for Sunday chores, and an insane sense of pride in not being the ""hot mess"" of days past.

Maybe it's strange to make a post about a clean sweater, haha... but I hope some of you can relate, or share other, subtle ways that sobriety has improved even the tiniest aspects of your life!",113

 “I’m an alcoholic.”

The reactions are priceless. People stumble over their words, go silent, ramble, ignore the statement all together, or act as if some something catastrophic has happened. They are as uncomfortable if not more than the question made me.

I’m not ashamed I abused alcohol. I am proud of how far I’ve come. I’m like “look how shit I used to be and how functional I am now”. It’s a victory, not a loss.

I’m not going to dance around things. I spent my drinking days hiding, ashamed of who I was. Now, I can tolerate my own company. I don’t care what people think of me. I worked hard for my three years, and social norms aren’t going to stop me from celebrating that.

If people feel the need to ask such questions, I’m giving them such answers. Maybe next time they will think twice before asking a stranger about their drinking habits.

But now I get it.","It’s a journey. The journey I’ve been on is one where I come to fully know -with every fiber of my being - that life without alcohol is better than life with it. My counter is wrong. I’ve had no major “relapses,” but I have drank a few glasses of wine on maybe 20-30 occasions since I first quit back in late December 2016. Each time added more evidence as to why drinking wasn’t as fun as I had let myself believe for so long. I have the ability to moderate; I can have one glass of wine and stop. BUT I DON’T WANT TO ANYMORE. It’s not worth it. 

One glass of wine makes me feel really good for 15mins, and then everything seems a little worse. I’m more likely to fight with my husband later in the evening. Even just one glass can make me wake up in the night with my heart racing, which is scary. And then the next day I always have a lingering sense of unease. I feel dissatisfied with my life. WHY WOULD I WILLINGLY CONSUME SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME EVER SO SLIGHTLY MORE DEPRESSED? 

I like my life. It’s often hard, but I am thankful for what I have. I don’t want to do anything that makes life harder than it needs to be.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!
Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!
This pledge is a statement of intent. Today we don't set out trying not to drink, we make a conscious decision not to drink. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
What this is: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
What this isn't: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

____________________________________________________

Good morning, good evening and good night to all of us.  I hope the weekend was just right.  Even if it was not just right, sometimes that is the way it goes.  I remember something I heard at an AA meeting many, many years ago.  I can't quote it directly, but the idea is this: sometimes you feel great and things are going well and you are kind of sailing along.  Other times the road is rough and you don't feel well and we, being human, tend to think that is a bad thing.  But this speaker said that those moments of despair or anger or indecision are moments of **grace.**  These moments are opportunities to teach ourselves something or to learn something new from the situation.  I don't usually think (when I am in troubled waters), oh look, it's a teaching moment, it's grace, it's an opportunity to learn!!!  But, sometimes it helps just a bit to know that it can be **grace** and that I have gotten myself out of those moments before and I can do it again. I just thought I would share that with you in case you are feeling that the seas and the roads are a bit rough.  We can always take heart together.",77

I would have long ago grabbed some whiskey...but not tonight (for one no whiskey in the house!) but also, and this lightens my mood actually, I will not drink and I see this as the tiny victory today that keeps me going and keeps the sh%$ that I had today a bay.

Last night: impromptu dinner for two at a fab local place. Nabbed a seat at the bar counter (place books up months in advance) Glass and a half of Chardonnay for her and a sparkling water for me. 

The guy next to me was on his own, and i watched as he had a few martinis and a bottle of wine to himself. That used to me be and I would be lying if i said my anxiety levels weren’t raised as the barman was pouring one old fashioned after another.  

Anyway; I got through it and ended up having a Lovely meal and conversation. No drama, no massive booze or taxi bill at the end and a lovely drive home listening to music. Calm. Relaxed. Comfortable. Not what our evenings out used to be like.",35

I didn't plan to drink that night, but I did and then there was an emergency I had to deal with that required me to get from point A to point B.  In my hurry, I rolled through a red light which landed me in serious legal trouble.  


The good news is that I just made it through all the hoops that I needed to jump through to get that charge dismissed.  Stayed clean for a year as a dry drunk.  


The bad new is that now I have freedom to do as I see fit.  Over the past couple of days I have decided it's ok to drink beer.  Starting with a 6 pack, ramping up to 24 per day.  This has gone on for the past 3 days or so.  Tonight, coming to terms that it's a real problem, I told my wife that I want to go to rehab.  We do have a small child that I want to protect.  I don't know if I should protect her by being gone from home and possibly getting help or if I should be present and doing AA work.   I also called a good friend from AA (from back when I was actually going to meetings).  He is 100% on board with transportation, meetings, working steps, etc that I need.    


I'm just not sure what's best for me at this point.  I feel like the structure of rehab would be good, but I'm scared.   


I'm just trying to get well.  Can anyone that's been to rehab speak to how to navigate this?",8

Now, I could've used this as an excuse to start drinking again and live in a state of denial, but instead I chose not to drink. I thought about his words carefully and I realized I didn't want to be remembered by my friends and family as someone that ""wasn't that bad"". I want to be a ambitious, caring, happy, kind, loving, and patient person. And SURPRISE alcohol stole every single one of these qualities from me. Granted, I was really good at faking when i needed to, but drinking numbed me to the point of not feeling much of anything but depression and anxiety. 

It's crazy how much of my true personality has surfaced over the last 80+ days. I'm slowly inching my way back to being a quality human being.  People have made many comments about my physical appearance but the change I'm the most proud of can only be seen by me.

I feel so sad, that yet again, I'm in a situation where I won't perform as well as I should, because I haven't prepared, and if I fail, this time, I'll fail hard.

He kicked me out and I sat in my moms car until she was ready to go, and I felt just as shitty as I would have if I were drinking. In fact he treated me as if I were drinking. When I called him out for being drunk he said something I can’t remember but along the lines of calling me an alcoholic. I told him I was done with that and he said “we will see how long that lasts”.

 A little about me: 36 yr old male from NYC, I'm a drill rig operator for deep building foundations and my last drink was on Jan 9th. The last time I was sober before that was from Oct 29th to Nov 7th while recovering from a finger amputation from a workplace accident. I started drinking again the very next day on the 8th when I went back to work, and I drank 6 days a week, anywhere from 14 to 18 and sometimes even more beers a day for 20 years prior to that. 

 I'm ashamed to admit it, but I only quit on Jan 9th because I almost died. I woke up for work and almost blacked out in the shower,and I felt like weak and disoriented. I ignored it, got dressed, walked to the train, just missed it by 1 second and I got irrationally angry and started cursing, seeing red and hyperventilating on the platform and that was the last thing I remember before waking up in the emergency room. Turns out my blood pressure was 219/123, and I was seconds away from having a stroke before I passed out. Shockingly, despite not having gone to a doctor for 18yrs, smoking 2 packs a day and all the alcohol abuse, my liver values were only 10 points over normal, and blood work/kidney/lungs were normal. I took this as a sign that this was my first and only warning and chance to stop destroying myself. So many of my friends never got that chance and I made a promise to myself, my wife, and to them that I wasn't going to waste it.

 I started looking online for information and came across this sub and have been lurking for sometime, and I just want to thank you all for sharing your struggles and supporting each other and giving me the strength to continue my own fight. I do have one question to ask, if you are willing to share your thoughts and opinions: Has anyone ever experienced a delayed onset of withdrawal symptoms or anxiety/other issues days or weeks after quitting? I thought I was lucky to not have any symptoms except for momentary urges to drink but now I'm concerned that the hammer is gonna drop on me anytime now and derail me.

Moderation. 

I have been able to moderate. I can have ONE glass of wine while I’m making dinner. I can have ONE glass of wine when I’m sitting with family. I cannot drunk draft beer. I overindulge. One pint will turn into 4 easily. 

Is there such a thing as recognizing why you drink as much as you do, and focus on fixing the actual cause?  Drinking in pubs is a trigger for me. I will keep drinking pint after pint after pint. Drinking at home is not. I’ll have one glass of wine or a beer while I’m doing other things.

2020-02-09 17:21:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f1g8ei/chains_of_shame_regret/,Chains of Shame & Regret,"I’m a life long alcoholic. My family knows I am working on my sobriety, and they are mostly supportive. My 36 year old niece just posted a meme on her FB page that said,

Alcoholism- the disease that makes you too selfish to see the havoc you create or care about the people you shattered.

I was doing better, but this was a big punch in the gut,  as I feel it was directed to me.  I get it, and damn...it hurts like hell!

Guilt & shame are the biggest obstacles in my getting sober.  I was sexually abused throughout childhood by my grandfather. My parents divorced when I was 5, and my mom became an alcoholic.  I swore I would not be like her, but I was worse.  I divorced when my daughter was 3. I was not a good mother to my now 19 year old daughter, and I have so many other regrets.  I don’t want to remember or face the truth, so I drown my brain with alcohol. 

I want to have a drink so bad right now, but I’ve gone 4 days without (and have no desire to a repeat suffering like I did the first 3 days detoxing).  I was drinking 15 vodka drinks a day (three 1.75 liters of vodka per week)- starting the moment I woke up & continuing until I passed out.  

I’ve lost my good job.  Friend & family avoid me. I’m so lonely.  I really don’t want to throw away the rest of my life.  I don’t want to die.  I just want to drink away this pain😢",12
2020-02-09 17:21:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f1g82q/maintaining_the_process/,Maintaining the process,"Morning of seventh day AF after binge last Monday evening.

Feeing physically and cognitively a great deal better.  These lasting effects (which may go to 10 days, I understand) are just not something I’ve ever considered when picking up a drink. Certainly it’s not something I gave any thought to when I was drinking regularly. 

I now recognise that this is a pernicious effect of grog though- if you’re on the turps regularly, your baseline mood/physical feeling is brought down, which in turn makes you look to a drink as a pick me up.

I am sure that in the past I have had long periods where I never fully escaped the after effects of one session before beginning another - this can only exacerbate depressive tendencies.

Closer to the present, the mad scramble and crazy post-binge low are now receding. Life is returning to normal, for which I am thankful (although there remains much humble pie to eat within the marriage).

What I can feel keenly though is specific guilt for failures to observe specific duties- particularly to my child. I must keep this type of guilt with me, rather than dissociate myself from it.

Imagining a drunk self (distinct from normal, sober, responsible self) just lets me off the hook- I have done this in the past.

Getting some days on the board has been helpful, as has been maintaining daily routines to keep AF commitment front of mind (though a drink obviously holds no appeal for me at this point).

usually on a saturday night, i’ll be mega drunk or blacked out. but not this time - i was completely sober and okay.

at around 1am saturday night, i got a call from my mum saying that she needs help. 

she told me that my terminally ill grandmother is going to die shortly. both my mum and my dad had been drinking that night (of course, not expecting this to happen) and so were not able to drive, and all of the taxi services around us were unavailable at the time. 

the only person that could take her was me. 

i drove her to the hospital, perfectly sober. we managed to make it in time so that my mum could spend the final moments with her before she passed.

it’s upsetting, for sure. i loved her a lot and i’m going to miss her a lot. but in a way, i’m thankful. i’m thankful that my mum was able to have that last moment with her. if she had to wait for a taxi, then i’m certain she wouldn’t have made it in time.

a few weeks ago this would have been impossible for me to do. although i’m sad this makes me want to keep going with sobriety.

sorry if this comes off to anybody in a selfish way centering it about me - i just haven’t told anyone about this situation yet and thought i’d offload here.

2020-02-09 14:33:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f1dozz/one_year_alcohol_free_now_what/,One Year+ Alcohol Free. Now what?,"So I gave up alcohol a year ago this month. I had a 42 year relationship that needed to be addressed. I’m 58 and I had some health issues that I misdiagnosed as liver-related, but I later found out that it was related to heart arrhythmia. I never had any real alcohol-related issues at home or at work, since I was always functional, careful, and sneaky. Never had a real “rock bottom” unless getting yelled at by my wife after she found a hidden nip (if she ever saw what she didn’t find…) So, I dropped about 50 lbs (I need to lose more) and many of these chronic issues disappeared. I was able to quit cold turkey, and for the last year I have never been more than 3 feet away from a beer or a bottle. I was a little surprised how well my will-power held up.

Regarding the relationship…it’s complicated. Nearly every fun experience or memory from my younger days involves alcohol consumption. All the parties, all the crazy stories-I don’t regret anything. My adult life has been more sedate, but all socialization has revolved around alcohol. Every male friend I’ve ever had is basically a drinking buddy. Every “guys weekend” or time apart from the family was just an excuse to drink like I used to drink, without the responsibility of being a husband or a dad hanging over me. The hope was that alcohol increased the chances that SOMETHING or ANYTHING fun might happen during these little breaks from my “normal”, dull, constrained, boring life. Over time, the socializing aspect behind the drinking has withered away, as friends seem to be dropping away to live their own lives. My “getaways” became just me, a chair, a TV, and various smuggled or hidden bottles of booze. This was after I made my nightly “food gathering” round of takeout for the family, which was really just and excuse to sneak in a couple extra mai-thais or vodka tonics before setting in for the evening and falling asleep at 9PM. I always knew this wasn’t normal behavior, and a year ago I decided to quit. Since no one in my life knows the full extent of my drinking habits, no one knows what a significant change this has been.

So, hear I am, a year away from alcohol (I should say I substituted cannabis after it became legal in my state), and I’m not sure how I feel. I think I jumped the gun on my medical self-diagnosis, but I’m also aware that 42 years of drinking is going to take a toll somewhere. I’ve come to the realization that it’s basically poison. I’m clear-headed every morning, sleep is good, I’ve lost the facial bloat, and I don’t sweat while brushing my teeth. When I consider taking a drink, I do a cost vs benefit analysis in my head, and so far, abstention is winning. I am very glad I'm not sneaking around, smuggling in bottles, burying the empties deep in the trash barrel, planning my day around securing what I want for the nightly buzz. But many things haven’t changed. I’m still bored to tears, lonely, and depressed, in spite of having a life that many people would envy. The idea that drinking as an interest or a past time has been taken from me makes me angry. I enjoyed checking out new breweries or a new high end bourbon. I enjoyed planning drinking as an activity, and now there are no activities because everything I enjoy involves (but doesn't necessarily depend on) drinking. The realization that I can never socialize in the same way has hit me hard, and making me withdraw even more from the world. Being sober is not fun, but I also don’t see the point of drinking anymore. Cannabis has made it a bit easier, but being high is lagging in cultural acceptance, especially in the affluent suburbs of Boston.

I’ve seen some people mention a type of “grieving” process that happens when you quit drinking. Is this what I’m feeling? I’m still trying to decide what happens with this milestone. I proved to myself that I can do it, and this time has allowed me to break down and analyze my dysfunctional patterns of drinking. Do I continue with the hard abstain or try a glass of wine with the wife or a beer with a friend again?",11

I last drank on New Years Eve, so around 40 days now. This is the longest I have gone without drinking in nearly 8 years and while I am sure there are still challenges ahead (40 days is both a long time and a very brief absence from alcohol), my life has completely changed. Since late December, I started exercising and dieting. Between quitting drinking and the other lifestyle changes, I've lost 25-30 pounds. I'm at my lowest weight in probably 5-6 years. 

But it's not just physical changes, mentally I am in a great place. For years, I suffered from depression and anxiety, along with insomnia. Those issues have disappeared. I feel 30 years younger without downing 7 or 8 drinks every night after work. 

And speaking of work, I have probably hit a new high point in my career. I have energy and enthusiasm when I go to work now. I wake up before my alarm goes off, ready to start the day. I'm not dragging myself out of bed each morning and dreading having to actually go in and deal with...stuff. Not to go too much into what I do for a career but compared to 1 year ago, my productivity and the amount of money I'm bringing into the business is up 20%. 

And for the first time in my life, I have a handle on my finances. I have paid off 2 credit cards this year, have been putting amounts of money into savings that I once thought were impossible, and am suddenly finding myself with enough money to buy a house. Despite being in my early to mid-30's, with a well paying career, the idea of buying a house or getting rid of debt, even 2 months ago seemed daunting and nearly unachievable. 

It's a wonder what just 6 weeks away from alcohol has done for my life. There is still a ways to go but for the first time in years, I finally feel like my life in on track again.",90

This advise may not work for most of you, as you will see why shortly, but it did the trick for me.

I wanted to quit smoking before I wanted to quit drinking. It was expensive, put holes in my clothes, wasted time, and made me smell terrible. But it was hard to quit. Eventually I figured a way to at least smoke less: Only smoke when I drank. This way I wouldn't smoke while working and during the day.

But, the end of the day came which meant a trip to the bar. And with that first shot came the first cigarette. But at least I put the monster in a box.

But a problem came that I didn't expect: I was drinking more. Man I really need a cigarette. What do I do? Buy a bottle from the liquor store and take a few swigs in my car, of course. With the liquor in me I was now allowed to smoke.  It seems crazy just typing that out.

So I had some control over smoking, but the drinking was getting crazy. I knew what had to be done next. I quit drinking and with it smoking as well. It is also a warning system to my family: If they see me smoking they know that can only mean one thing.

So that's how I did it. I know it may not be a great way or even a practical way for most of you, but quiting both was easier than I expect with this approach.",11

You're one of the most inspiring communities on reddit. #IWNDWYT

I've had a wide ranging relationship with alcohol overall being pretty controlled with one or two bad nights a year, but did a life review at the end of 2019 and realized there were so many things i wanted to do with my life, namely finish this novel I have been writing off and on for two years (more off, than on) and start a business. I really felt like drinking was the biggest thing holding me back, and here i am on day 20 and still haven't written that book (did some writing in jan) or started my business (opened my coding console for this time in 5+ years). On a tuesday night i'll get the kids to bed and watch TV with ice cream instead of be on my 3rd or 4th drink and do whatever i did before. Seems like i'm just swapping one vice for another. Making me question this whole thing :/

Anyone had feelings like this before?",7

I thought it was such a good read that I wanted to pass it along: 

[Alcoholism isn’t about Drinking too much: Alcoholism is about Pain.](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2020/02/alcoholism-isnt-about-drinking-too-much-alcoholism-is-about-pain-matthew-salis/)

\-----------------

**If you want a preview, here are a few excerpts that really connected for me:** 

*Alcoholism isn’t about drinking at all. It’s about the demon the poison turns us into. The demon is annoying, crass, and disgusting when drinking. When that demon is sober, however, that’s when he’s really dangerous.*

\--

*I was clutching tight to a* [*fantasy*](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2019/05/the-alcoholic-lies-that-we-are-all-guilty-of-believing-matthew-salis/)*. I was asking for the impossible. There was nothing carefree or relaxing about alcohol at that point. I was using booze to medicate the stress from those millions of responsibilities. I was drinking to make the pain of a crumbling marriage go away. I wasn’t having fun anymore. I was trying to forget the horrible things I said when I was drunk, by getting drunk again.*

\--

*During my active alcoholism, in the sobriety between the times when I drank, I was arrogant, selfish, and angry. I said mean things as a part of the process of denying how broken I was. I made my wife question her parenting skills, I made her think our relationship problems were because she wasn’t loving enough, and I eroded her self-esteem by berating her decisions and questioning her values.*

\--

*How can I be sure that the insults I leveled at my wife, both while drunk and while sober between drinking sessions, were not how I really felt? How do I know alcohol isn’t the ultimate truth serum? How can I be so sure the words I used to beat my wife down aren’t the truth that lives in my heart?*

*I know because those words went away as I healed from addiction and transitioned back from the alcoholic monster I was for so many years. I don’t say those things anymore. Never. I don’t have to work to suppress the feelings of anger for my wife. I don’t feel those feelings at all. It isn’t a matter of alcohol setting my deep, dark secrets free. Those feelings* [*no longer exist*](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2020/01/the-2-questions-to-ask-yourself-really-ask-yourself-about-addiction-matthew-salis/)*.*

\--

[*Sobriety doesn’t fix anything*](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2019/12/sobriety-doesnt-fix-anything-the-pain-inflicted-by-a-post-alcoholic-marriage-matthew-salis/)*. It’s just the prerequisite to healing. Patience, open-minded communication, and hope are all necessary to transition recovery into enlightenment.*

*When we find the person we were meant to be cowering beneath the insidious possession of alcoholism, the feeling is indescribable. It’s really quite something to realize you’re not the asshole you’ve been pretending to be for years. When the truth emerges, that’s when healing can begin.*",150

1. Being inappropriately drunk at events. I remember this dude I was sitting near got up and sat somewhere else. I felt like an asshat.

2. Getting into verbal altercations in social settings. Was discussing something somewhat political and it turned into me being an angry incoherent mess. I was ashamed afterwards.

3.alcohol and cars. I won't elaborate, but you know.

4. The death knell for me: hanging out with someone I just met (trying to make friends in a new city) and I got so drunk that he ended up leaving the bar and ghosting me. 

January 24th was my last drink and I'm looking to extend that to 100 days without alcohol.

2020-02-09 10:15:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f19wxb/9_days_without_any_alcohol/,9 days without any alcohol,"Hey, everyone.


I used to be part of this subreddit a while back, then I left when I fooled myself into thinking that “I didn’t have a problem.” Well, my problem culminated in a series of panic attacks induced by anxiety that was induced by the booze. 

For a while I felt afraid to leave my room — my world was getting smaller and smaller. When I felt like this initially, a few beers would have me feeling normal again, but I knew deep down that wasn’t a sustainable long term solution. 

I decided to stop drinking when I couldn’t get out of bed because of the sinking sensation I felt in my chest. At first, it was difficult — but staying in for a few days to myself really helped. 

I’m now on day 9, and, boy, do I feel great as opposed to how I felt a week ago. My anxiety is still there, but the normal amount anyone feels dealing with life’s challenges. My sleep schedule is just now settling in; I can sleep peacefully now from 10:30 pm to 6:30 a.m. Waking up without a hangover feels amazing, and my body is slowly getting rid of the cravings for alcohol. 

My social life took a hit, of course, but the world — and life in general — has many things to offer, so replace those social outings with a new hobby that doesn’t involve self-destruction. 

If you take away anything from this is that — as others have said — we all fail many times, and that in the beginning, it does get worse, but eventually, things do get better. 

I can’t guarantee I will never drink again, but what I can say is that I feel more motivated than ever to continue in my sobriety. The last couple of days have been very productive, to say the least.

I came home, told the wife I was going to jump in the hot tub and to make me a drink. It was like 20 outside and I don't think I've ever been in the hot tub without a drink before.

So literally, right after I ask her to make me a bourbon, I pick up my phone and see a reddit notification. u/cliffy348801 had messeged me asking how my day 11 was. We were on the same day.

I mean straight up, I had just asked for a drink and before it was in my hand I saw a reddit message asking how my sobriety was. What a great coincidence. Perfect timing. It still wasn't easy to not drink. But that gave me the strength I needed to muscle through.

I wanted to share a story about a stressful work trip that I had last week. I do research in education and my research team flew across the country to do a training for our partner schools. As is usually the case, our training materials are revised last minute. So, the team was frantic, as some people were going to pick up copies at kinkos, others were repackaging the training materials, and others were setting up the training space. 
Tension was high and nerves were a bit frayed. 

While I was helping prep the new materials, the training director of this program walked up to me, handed me her laptop, and asked me to set up her computer. She is a bit older and I have a bit of experience with computers, so I wasn't sure what she needed. I asked her, ""can you tell me what you mean?"" Her response was, ""you know, set up my computer."" I was baffled, so I said I can't help. On principle, I am trying to say no to things I know I can't do or am not clear on. One of my co-workers chimed in and said, ""oh yogi_lc, you are worthless."" I was shocked, angered, wanted to explode. I knew I had to respond, but I didn't want to respond with anger. I told her, ""that is not a nice thing to say."" Not going to go down in history as the wittiest comeback, and I have replayed the moment in my head a hundred times with sharp barbs, but it was the best I could do. 

Anyway, we made it through the training and it came off well in the end. At the end of the night, another coworker and old drinking buddy asked me to go get drinks with him and explore downtown. I politely said no and just went back to my hotel room. This week I have been processing this resentment and I am seeing that I have a common fear of being perceived as worthless. So, being called that in a work situation kind of strikes at the heart of my insecurities. I am glad that I made it through the trip sober. IWNDWYT",6

With him be bought some CBD oil for me.

I've used cannabis for as long as I've drank alcohol, which is a really long time. I enjoy that weed helps me sleep, however the paranoia and guilt it stimulates is never an enjoyable side effect, my brain never functions the next day. Always hazy, struggling to form basic sentences, indecisive, generally useless. Very different to a purely alcohol induced hangover.

CBD oil is not something I've ever tried, however his suggestion is that it might help take the edge off during the early days of sobriety. No THC so none of the psych side effects. I'm interested.

My attitude is that I have nothing to lose. It's quite a high dosage. I'm hoping it will stop my mind from racing in the times of calm. Relaxing is something I have no idea how to do without being wasted. During the next few weeks as my body adjusts, I know my mind is going to have the shackles taken off and honestly, the idea is terrorfying.

I'm interested to hear if it's helped you during recovery? I've looked back through some old posts and seen a lot of mixed reactions.

Happy Sunday!

People ask me sometimes if quitting was hard, which I always find a hard question to answer. Like, actually stopping drinking wasn't really that hard for me but ""quitting drinking"" *has* been, in a lot of ways. Hard in the way that all good things are hard: writing is hard, learning guitar is hard, going to the gym is hard, but the result is worth the effort. Writing here because the last few weeks have felt like one of sobriety's psychological tectonic shifts and I wanted to talk through it I guess. Every few months, I feel some palpable shift in how I see myself and while, again, they're all net positive, I also find it mildly distressing to then process what to do with the newly exposed self.

The latest one is realizing how introverted I have become, and trying to sort out a healthy relationship to solitude. I used to be extremely extroverted: first one at the party, last one to leave. I still have a really giant and well-maintained network of friends, and an active social life. But I also really, really love being alone and often feel like I have to motivate myself to go do things with people. I'm hounded by this feeling that I ""should"" want to be out all the time, date around, meet new people etc. But I just... dont? And because I've lived 33 years as a happy little extrovert, I'm having a hard time accepting or understanding this new very contented desire to just sorta be on my own. I still like socializing, but I find it exhausting now in a way I didn't used to. I am not closed to the idea of romantic love, but I don't really crave it like I used to and that worries me.

I think the healthiest read on it is maybe that sobriety has so dramatically improved my relationship with myself, even the bits of it I didn't realize were unhealthy, that I need less from other people? But the other read is that I've become a weird hermit who will be celibate and alone forever lol? I don't really know if I have a fine-pointed question as much as I'd really like to hear from others who found that sobriety shifted their social needs and how you dealt with that.

To be clear: I'm really happy, not depressed at all. On the whole, I've been in one of the healthiest mental spaces in my life. I'm just finding it hard to shake the feeling that sobriety is dooming me to a life of solitude because it's improved my self worth too much lol?",3

We started this at 3pm, and then went out to a club until 2am. I know some people wouldn’t choose to put themselves in that situation, which is totally fine, of course.

I stayed sober. I only told one person, I was just sneaky with my drinks - a lot of soda and lime - and the girl who knew helped me out a lot. Turns out most people are actually not paying that much attention!!

I usually find the first hour the most frustrating in terms of actually wanting a drink. Once that passed, I didn’t wish I was drinking anymore. A couple of times I was a little bored, but generally I had an awesome time and danced and chatted the night away. I’m not saying I didn’t miss it a little, or it was perfect, but it was OKAY! It was fun! And, most importantly, it was worth it. 

I know not drinking is nothing to be ashamed of, but this time I just wanted to take the easy route this time, which is why I kept it secret. Sometimes you just gotta give yourself an easy life! 

I would normally be the girl being cheered on, downing glasses and glasses and glasses in one.

I woke up this morning and I am elated and so proud. I can promise you, it’s so worth it. And if I can do it, so can you.

For the rest of the night I didn’t feel interested in having a drink though. I have mixed emotions about the night. I had a great time when we were in a small group / the right people but there were times I got so much anxiety about seeing people from previous nights out. I’ve done some horrific things drunk which I guess reminds me of why I am choosing to live this way now. I feel like I’d do better in a city or town that doesn’t know me. Anyway, I am proud that I coped with my first night out without any alcohol. It is easier to fit in than expected when you’re in a comfortable situation. However, there’s nothing worse than seeing a person that you know has experienced you doing some really disturbing things when you were drunk.

There have been times when I've decided to quit drinking and sometimes I've even been able to go a couple of weeks without a drink (17 days is actually my personal record) but I always end up ""rewarding"" myself for that success by allowing myself to have a few drinks. That will always end up in me going on a bender. I can't drink like a normal person would. I can't enjoy one night out with a few drinks and I can't have a few glasses of wine to relax, none of that. It's all or nothing for me and now I have to make the decision to never have a drink again since moderation will not work for me. I've been 4 days sober now, I know it's not much. But what makes it different from the last times I tried is that now I'm not thinking of it as a temporary thing... I have to permanently change my life.

It's happened to a lesser degree a couple of times in the past year and I wanted to share it with y'all.

Saturday morning I wake up with a pretty strong dull headache and some nausea.  I lay in bed for a few minutes to pull myself together, then I get up and pee and get a glass of water.  I lay back down and turn on the TV and doze in and out for an hour or so.  By 10 it's moderately better and I pull on my robe and wander downstairs.  I start the coffee and putter around the kitchen.  Spend the next few hours split between the couch, my armchair, the patio, and bed.  By noon it's just a dull headache and I take a few aspirin and go about my weekend chores and errands.  By 4 or 5pm I am back at 100% and that's that.

Things I did not have to do during this time: lie to my wife about how I was feeling, lie to my wife about what caused it, try and hide my condition from my daughter, be embarrassed about it, feel bad about it, feel shame about it, regret anything that may have happened the night before, wonder what happened the night before, swear to myself that I won't ever drink this much again, guzzle water to try and rehydrate, etc, etc.

I was sick, I got to act like I was sick for a few hours, I knew there was nothing I did to cause myself to be sick, my family knew there was nothing I did to cause it, there was no shame, lying, regret, embarrassment.  I took two asprin, made some coffee, watched a movie and went on with my life.

First, it makes me feel so much better to not have shame and guilt and regret about being hungover, because I wasn't hungover.

Second, and I'm not sure exactly how to phrase this, but the me of a year ago who MIGHT have been hungover because he had 10 drinks the night before... he might have also been sick (actual sick), but because of the 10 drinks, he would have attributed it to the drinking, and he'd have had shame and guilt and embarrassment that way as well.  Even for a legitimate illness. 

Anyway, since I've been sober, every time I'm ill... I really embrace it.  It's such a relief to not be hungover.",14

I've long stopped counting.  I've stopped counting the days.  I've stopped counting the deaths.

Today, I woke up.  People, I've shared joints with, Corona's with, lines with, did not.

I've stopped counting.  

I woke up much as before.  The more things change the more things stay the same.  

I woke up and it was still dark.  Full moon rising.  6:09PM.  I woke up and it was dark again, already.  

What day is it?  When was the last time my dog has been out?  Where the fuck is my daughter?  

Questions of before, the questions of today.   

How much did I drink last night??

Nothing, again,  it's been four years.  It's been one thousand, four hundred and sixty days.  But the question still lingers, deeply cemented in the crystal structure of habits.

I've returned back to a feral state, waking up in shit's creek, needing to go up stream.  My beard has gone long, the dirty dishes have grown crusty, piles of laundry scattered in bedrooms, and bathroom were at one time neatly stacked in inconspicuous piles.

Day one was much like today.  I woke up in the dark.  Not knowing a multitude of things, while knowing others.  I knew that I was supposed to have worked.  I knew that I wanted to slit my wrists because I was so sick of this shit, I knew that I was going to try and stop drinking, tomorrow, because Lent was coming.  There would be one last hurrah of sitting in my chair watching Netflix drinking alone, followed by another day of self hatred.  

Today, their bodies are in the cold frozen grounds, or reverted back to ashes and dust.  All leaving behind friends and family to continue the war against self destruction.  

I believe that Jesus died for our sins.  I believe in the word of God, and that it is only through him, that trinity, that we can have Salvation.  Blah blah blah.  I'm obligated to spread the Gospel, so there you go.  

I died that day.  But unlike them, I returned.  To thine own self be true...  Born anew, free from drunkenness, but only for today.

I decided there would be no last hurrah.  It would be today.  Today the first day, and the only day.

Religion is the opium of the people.  No.  This is wrong. Opium is the opium of the people?  No, that's closer but still off the mark.

Use as directed.  Drink responsibly.  Do not crush.

Alcohol isn't even the opium of the people.  The opium of the people is oxycodone hydrochloride:  OxyContin, aka Oxy IR, aka Roxicodone.


¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Whoops.  Sorry Midwest.   Sorry New England.  Sorry Appalachia.  Florida.  

What's a conspiracy theory?  I got one for you.  There is a family out there that knew.  These Mother Fuckers are responsible.  I'm going hard here, because, I've gone feral, to thine own self be true, and I'm still here, those in ground or reverted back to ashes and dust are not.  There will be no more todays.  No more tomorrows.

These people are literal Mother Fuckers.  They've killed the sons and daughters of mothers.  They've killed mothers of sons and daughters.  These Mother Fuckers have a name.

Purdue pharma.  There are names behind the name.  They make Epstein and Weinstein look like choir boys.  This cabal has foot soldiers in the 1%.  The pharmacy reps, the doctors, the DOJ, DEA, all pawns in their empire.

According to The Guardian 100 people die of opiates in the US.  Every Day.

The Sackler family.  The philanthropists funding the Ivy League, the Tate, the Guggenheim.  The family that made Valium the most prescribed American drug at one time.  The family that made antibiotics seem like a panacea for all maladies: viral and bacterial.  Perhaps responsible for the antibiotic resistance bacteria emerging.  Perhaps not.

Time released oxycodone for back aches, tooth aches, and menstrual problems.  Use responsibly.  They knew the dangers, the risk, and the potential.  The potential for profit...  This is truth, hiding in plain site.  Is this even a conspiracy theory?

Now they are cashing in again on the crisis.  They are now leading the way with the solution.  Nyxoid.  Who owns the patent?  Yeah...  take a guess.

Well, this really isn't about opiates at all.  It's actually about alcohol.  We're injected with the Corona virus at birth.  The other Corona virus.  The Corona with Lime virus.  Yes, at birth we begin, being bombarded with advertisements showing us that a Corona with Lime is the way.  The way to relax, the way to get laid, the way to make friends, and the way to be thin with clear skin, or the way to six pack abs with a full head of hair.  Yes, this is the more, much more, dangerous Corona virus.

We all know about the tobacco industry.  About how they flooded the market with a product they claimed to be not dangerous or addictive.

The information about the Sackler's role in opiate epidemic is there.  It's all right there hiding in plain sight.  It's not really even hidden.  People on both the left and right have been screaming on their soap boxes for years.

Alcohol though...  my conspiracy theory...  it's parallel to tobacco and opiates.  They know, somewhere, and they are worth billions, getting richer and richer as more and more people become addicted, while ruining their lives and worse, the lives of those around them.

But I need to celebrate. As I prepare to go to bed sober yet again I can proudly tell you all and the world that I have made it 21 days. 

This is the longest I have been sober since I started problem drinking about 16 years ago. I’ve been as bad and low as going over a year straight without a sober day. 72+ hour benders. 3am vodka shots. 8am tequila slugs. I’ve been in pretty bad shape at times. Luckily o never hit that rock bottom(yet) and have avoided the ER and rehab. But I’m sure that will all change if I don’t continue to work on my sobriety. 

I am so happy and so proud of myself. I actually am starting to catch myself having internal dialogue about how it makes no sense to have a drink anymore solely because of how crappy I would feel in the morning. 

I’ve even managed to spend 8 of the last 21 evenings out at bars or restaurants with drinkers...and didn’t drink!  I attribute that to my all or nothing personality. 

If I’m going to have sober nights I would rather go all out and rub my face in it than hide at home alone avoiding people.  None of this wasting my precious time being a hermit - removed from society. 

Incase you missed it I made it 3 weeks! Yes!  Me!  3 weeks sober. Imagine that. I’m doing a great job.

Particularly a day like today. A Saturday for one is always kind of triggering to me still. I went to a birthday party and powered through with a water and lemon and lots of food and cake. It was a good time but that “element” was missing and it kinda bummed me out. 

I wish I was more confident this far along but I feel like I’m going to slip soon. I don’t know when but I feel like it’s around the corner. And it scares me. And excites me. And makes me sad. But I also have this gut feeling if I keep making this hard, yet right decision not to drink, my life is going to naturally unfold in a way that reflects this positive change. Basically, the good I work on for myself will attract other good things. In ways that still drinking would not attract.

Idk why I’m still hung up on getting drunk. It almost killed me. And I see how it lies to people. Partying at my age (26) is such a dominant theme and thing to do (I know it’s probably all ages..). Then as time goes by I see how it affects older adults. I see how some adults cling onto this identity of getting drunk and partying. But I also see this deep sadness with almost all alcoholics. They don’t have to say anything it’s just spelled out on their face. I read it on this sub that it’s like “chasing a mirage” . The old memories and good times we had with drinking. But behind all that is fucked up arguments and emotions not handled correctly. 

Anyways. Jumbled rant I guess. I gotta ramble here. I can’t in real life very often . It’s comes off preachy and douchey. This is where i process some random thoughts and revelations. Life is weird. Goodnight!",12

I work a lot (last year I took 49 days off) and I took a weekend to go fishing with some friends. The fish were not cooperative that day, but I had fun just being out and away from the working life. My friends were disappointed in the lack of action and expressed concern that our expedition was not very productive. I smiled and said “Hey guys, some fish is better than none fish”.

My point is, if we only have a day or a couple weeks of sobriety it is better than none. If we falter and begin again it is still better than not trying at all. Stay strong my friends, we can do this!

I've been thinking about taking a break for a while now. I'm not convinced it'll be a permanent quit but I know I need to make serious changes with my relationship to alcohol . 

The only control I have left is not being an every day drinker. I take 2 or 3 days off a week (mostly 2) but would prefer to have some everyday if it wasn't for my conscious trying to not lose all self control. 

I have been drinking about 4  IPA's on my drinking days after work and about 6 to 8 on my days off but if going out or special occasions I would drink a bit more, usually no more than 10 at the most. 

I'm 48, married and my wife doesn't drink at all, never has. She doesn't give me a hard time about my drinking so I only have myself to answer to. I eat pretty healthy and don't smoke or do anything else and have been thinking about actually using the exercise equipment I pay for at my rec center but never have the energy to wake up early enough to do that before work.

Reasons why I want to seriously cut back or quit:

1.  Black outs.. Not completely but really struggle to remember things while drinking. Like a recent poker game I attended I couldn't remember who won, I knew I didn't win but couldn't remember which of the other 4 of my good friends won. I had only 7 session IPA's 4.7 abv which is light for me. I didn't feel like I was wasted at all but the next day couldn't even remember which friend won when I was sitting right there! 

2. Passing out in my recliner while my wife is in bed. Waking up at like 3am crawling into bed and feeling guilty the next day. 

3. My 18 year old has made comments about my drinking that make me ashamed. One time I was scolding him about something after I had a couple beers, I wasn't being abusive or wasn't drunk at all but he called me an alcoholic which really hurt. 

4.  Every major regret in my life I was drunk. 

5. I've got really drunk at work functions, even passing out at a table in front of my coworkers. So embarrassing to see pictures from events like that where my face and eyes look wasted. 

6. I want to start working out. I eat really healthy and am not over weight but worried what the alcohol is doing to my aging body. 

I could list a lot more. I know I need to either be able to seriously learn to moderate or quit all together. Most of my friends I associate with share my love of craft beers. I actually really enjoy beer but once I start I don't want to stop. 

Glad I found this group! I just downloaded the naked mind on my iPad hearing people on here talk about it.

Today is my Friday and is the day I usually drink the most. My wife works early so she goes to bed early and I'm used to stopping at the store for a 6 pack or more and getting in my recliner, watching TV or listening to music until I pass out. Even though I have several cold beers still in my fridge from before I took this break, tonight I commit to all of you that I'll be drinking a polar cranberry lime seltzer 😊.

I had dinner with an iced tea and got home early. Usually, the next step for me in an evening like this would be to uncork/unscrew a bottle of wine and start drinking. I’m never depressed or anxious. I just like taste and the buzz. One drink deserves another, and soon most or all of the bottle is gone. If another bottle is available, I would start on that one too. Then I would usually go to sleep around midnight after watching TV and eating some snacks. Then I would wake up around 2 and not be able to get back to sleep.

I am grateful to be 30 days sober because at least now I can face this head on and deal with it. And at this point I literally don’t have any money to drink so I’ve got that going for me.,11

Of course she wasn't drinking, and my Husband wasn't either (he's got the same number of days as me, in solidarity, he doesn't have a problem) Anyway, in our 5 years together, 2.5 married, this is the first time that I have been around a big chunk of his extended family (which is huge : ) and didn't drink. There was plenty of beer and wine there, and I didn't have a drop. Tomorrow is 40 days sober for me, and before this, my old record was 30. But that's not why I'm writing. At the risk of going on forever, like I always do, I just wanted to say that I was searching in here last night - specifically the word ""Hawaii"" - because I'm going for my 40th birthday in a few weeks, and am so excited, beyond excited, but also nervous about the not drinking there part of it. I read a lot of old posts in here, some going back as far as 4 years, and it really helped me. The people that stayed sober on their vacations inspired me, and the ones that drank and were regretful (even though I felt bad for them) helped me remember that I don't want to come back from my trip disappointed in myself, etc. It also really stayed with me that you never know if your post in here is going to help someone else in here today, or tonight, or 4 years from now.

Stream of consciousness as the Witching Hour comes to a close.,"This is just a stream of consciousness as my witching hour, about 5pm-8pm, comes to a close. If you're in your witching hour right now, know that you're not alone.

But seriously, what is it about this chunk of time that makes my mind do all sorts of torturous gymnastics to try to get me to drink? But of course, I know the answer. I was never the ""all-day"" drinker; I come home from work, or wind down from a weekend day, with alcohol. That's why this time block is a nightmare. It's when I normally drink. It's wired into my fucked up brain.

This will be my day one again. Longest streak was 12 days back in the summer. One day at a fucking time. Finding distractions is key for me.

Below are some of the thoughts my mind uses to get me to drink during these hours. Again, **trigger warning.** I wouldn't want anyone to read these and have them seep into their head; they're utter nonsense. But this is what my mind produces.

* ""You and your wife are in a long-distance relationship currently, and you live alone. How else can you cope?""
* ""You're alone even when you're not alone. How else can you cope?""
* ""You have no friends. What else is there to do?""
* ""You'll start tomorrow; just one more day of drinking is okay since XYZ happened.""
* ""You're a hopeless alcoholic. It doesn't matter if you make it 1 day or 1,000 days -- you will eventually relapse and your disease will kill you, anyway. Might as well drink.""

All of these thoughts are nonsense. All excuses. But it is astounding how real they feel during the Witching Hour (and, to a lesser extent, outside of it). My mind can flip like a switch.

But shit, here's to day one again. I've made it a full 24 hours without picking up the drink at the time of writing. Tomorrow, I will have plenty of distractions -- church, visiting with family, and ACA. But those won't perfectly overlap with the Witching Hour. I have to make sure that three hour block is covered.

At least, in my many failed attempts, I've learned that there is a particular time of day I need to target with some sort of activity. Planning ahead will be key.

Best of luck, all. IWNDWYT.",3

2020-02-08 19:02:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f106vc/im_quitting_today/,"I'm quitting, today","2 weeks ago, I crashed my car while on my way to work after drinking 700ML of vodka- a routine I've been upholding for the past couple months. I got insanely lucky, as when the officer patted me down before putting me in the squad car to transport me to work down the road, he felt my bottle. He said, ""Bottle?"" And I said, ""Yeah it's Sprite"" because I poured it all in a Sprite bottle. If he was more diligent or smelled the alcohol on my breath, I would have been rightfully fucked. Luckily no one was involved.

Despite that incident, I still kept drinking. I lost my job on the same day I got into the accident, because they could tell I was fucked up due to my breath. I always carry gum in my car, I've been playing a very risky game, and it finally caught up to me.

Now, I bounced back and I hav a job interview as a car salesman at an awesome dealership. The Indeed ad said the salary range was between 60-85k (salary + commission). That's literally twice the amount I made at my old job.

All I want to do now is walk down to the liquor store 2 minutes from my apartment and grab a $5 bottle of Brandy, get drunk and watch Trailer Park Boys. I tell myself, this is the last drink, then I'm done... I keep making these excuses to keep drinking.

No more. I'm not letting my addiction to alcohol ruin another opportunity for me. I was doing so well at my last job. They were ready to promote me to manager since I've been training people effectively for the longest time there. 

So, instead of drinking, I'm going to take a bath, make dinner and prep for my interview in 2 days at the dealership.

Today was a beautiful day here, after a long nasty winter.  The kind where you can feel that spring is on the way.  I really wanted to get a couple beers and go to the park like I usually would.  So I compromised and picked up two alcohol free beers and went to the park to sit in the sun.  And you know what?  It was great.  Sitting in the park on a nice day with a couple of beers used to be one of my favorite things to do, and I was happy to find that I can still enjoy it just as much.  In fact, I enjoyed it even more because in the past one or two beers at the park would leave me wanting more, and then I'd go home and drink, or go out and drink, and get drunk and feel like shit the next day, then drink again that day to not feel like shit... you know the drill.  But today I enjoyed it with the knowledge that I wouldn't keep drinking, that I wouldn't get drunk, and that I wouldn't have a hangover and that I could go home and have a productive rest of the day, and a nice Sunday as well.

I did buy ""de-alcoholised"" white wine because I was making carbonara at home and wanted the treat. It tasted like wine and being honest, it went deliciously with the carbonara... But after that, I didn't want anymore.

I found it funny in a way because as a heavy wine drinker it was actually alright in comparison at the start. In my brain though I'd been craving that lovely cold taste of a glass of white (rather than its affects if that makes sense) and yet, when I got pretty much 90% in taste towards it.

It seems like so many of you have gotten to a head space where you can really articulate why you drink and why you’ve stopped, so, being a little confused about how to understand my drinking, I was wondering if anyone else experienced this kind of confusion before. 
In college I was able to enjoy drinking and socializing no problem, whether it was a casual beer by a campfire or going out dancing. But in the last four years or so (I’m 26F) I’ve noticed something bizarre and different than what I used to experience. When I drink, even a half a beer or less, I kind of change? I don’t like the person I am, and I start to lose control on even a few sips, and I don’t feel like I’m making any connections with anybody or even being nice. I feel like I become really dark inside. If I do have a bit of drink, my friends or my sister will tell me they don’t notice a difference in my demeanor at all, but I feel the difference so strongly! 
So for the past two years I have barely had a full drink. Once every few months or so I’ll order a beer thinking it shouldn’t be a big deal, but then I have a few sips and I realize I’m not myself anymore and will give it to someone else and go home. I’ll decline wine or beer when I’m offered, and will lighten it up by joking about being a lightweight, but there’s something about alcohol that will immediately take me somewhere dark and vulnerable. Sober, I’ve been told I’m very funny and bring everybody together, so I guess I’m just struggling to define what my problem with drinking is. Or should I not make pains to define it as something at all, and merely identify the trigger and stay away? 
Anyway, sorry for the long vent session and I appreciate you all taking the time to read this. I realized this might be the most I’ve said about it ever. I hope you all continue to have bright and unfoggy Saturdays!",10

I've found this stretch of time to be different than other long-ish stretches of time I've been sober in that I've tried really hard to concentrate on countering the impulses to drink with vividly picturing the worst physical/mental states  alcohol has put be in. Like times where it'd be just 12 hours straight of nausea and going weeks on end without taking even a day off and everyday of my life started to be defined almost exclusively by thinking up excuses to drink. For the last few years it's been like 95% just by myself drinking which is extra fucked up.

Anyway I've also tried to not let my mind wonder into the future too much because I know I'll just automatically start trying to define some circumstance or time milestone that I sort of arbitrarily decide as ""okay xyz will have marked long enough of a break"" but intellectually I know that I'll just go straight back into drinking for days on end, again looking for any and every excuse to start.

Today/this afternoon is the first time in a while I've felt extremely strong cravings and keep imaginaing myself dirnking in like fun cool bars and chatting up strangers.... I'm on antabuse so I'm glad I have that as a way to prevent myself from actually going and doing it.

But I'm also worried about starting to like ""count down"" the days until I calculate that the antabuse is enough out of my system for me to go and binge drink.

Right now I still feel like I'm in control but I'm also scared of losing control .... just feeling this urge and feeling my brain start to form all these rationalizations of why drinking would be okay and so fun and all.

Please help , how do I nip this sort of stronger nagging urge in the bud?",3

Bachelor parties, boys weekends and family getaways. Everytime, without failure, drinking was the main activity, sometimes the only activity for a whole week. 

I booked this particular vacation before I made the commitment to quit drinking. I was worried about getting on the plane and what it would mean to me to be faced with the bright lights sober. 

As I sit here on with a fresh coffee beside my family, it has been a completely different experience than my last 8 trips. I can remember every show we saw, we did hikes and day trips that would have killed me to do hungover. I finally feel rested from a vacation! This must be what non-alcoholics feel after a vacation... relaxed, energized and ready to get back to real life. My family, who also drinks all the time; showed me a ton of solidarity and did not drink at all. Most of them have already told me in private that they want to stop drinking as well... no better test than making it through a week long sober-fest in vegas. ""If you can do it here, you can do it anywhere"" they said. Hopefully it sticks with them..  but at least all of them can remember this trip and how it brought our family together over a drink... of coffee.

I seriously contemplated downing it. It was the most intense temptation since I quit drinking 3 months ago. Never mind that it was 8 in the morning, that first sip would help-I was sure of it. It would numb and help me be able to breathe. This is what I have told myself countless times before. My first thought when I’m upset, confused or angry is to drink. It is completely linear thinking to which I have allowed myself to give into for 10+ years. I have never drank responsibly; I have never seen the value in just one drink. All or nothing; go big or go home. The first time I got drunk at 13 I blacked out. To say I was drinking heavily at 13 years old is shocking and scary. I have been drinking for 19 years, “problem” drinking for 10. However if I’m honest with myself, it was always a problem. One morning after, I said to a friend  “I was practically sober last night-I remember everything!” To me, being aware of what I did and said meant that I had drank responsibly. Obviously, this is not true but staying lucid while drinking happened so rarely that this philosophy was easily ignored. I have said and done things while drinking that I am mortified about-horrified that I would put others and myself in many, shall we say, “unsavoury” circumstances. I have been the source of worry and concern for many years now, and I am done. I want people to be able to rely and depend on me.

I have been smoking weed for 10 years on a daily, but only by my self and only by night. Weed isn’t physically addictive as booze is but I find that replacing a substance by another one is not the best way to go since it shows you still can’t deal with being sober really. I know all goals and reasons why we go AF are different but I’m wondering how youre managing wanting to be sober without actually being sober...? 

I’ve only been AF for a few days and I am on the pink cloud because for the first time in my life, I have not smoked either. I enjoy being sober and having a clear mind and don’t wanna mess it up by smoking. I’m trying to notice how I sleep better and live better and it feels that smoking weed goes against that desire. I’m just a bit anxious that in the long run I will be using weed as a replacement and just go back to my behaviour of abuse. 

I would love to hear your stories and know how you deal with this idea of not drinking but not really being sober either.",3

I was 27 when I decided that it was time to try something new, something different for a change. I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. ( an old cliche but its true )

So I decided to give up alcohol. I didn't think it would last, and i had such incredible self doubt about my ability to keep myself on the straight and narrow. But as they say I took it one day at a time. the beginning was hard. Every time I felt like I was having issues, I would turn on a podcast and go on a walk. I went on a lot of walks that first month. I went from 180lbs down to 160 as the water weight and the booze worked its way from my body.

It was difficult. Dealing with the constant nagging of giving in. Struggling to be myself, to be a human at parties, events, bars, all of that was something I had to relearn what to do. how to act, and how to be genuine. People constantly questioning your decisions, your old friends who drink trying to get you to revert, learning how to actually deal with emotions again... it is as hard as it sounds. but it gets better.

I got a job in a new field and every year making more and more money than the previous. I traveled the world, flying to places like Sydney, London, Toronto, and all over the United States. I worked out every other day and got in the best looking shape of my life. ( I still needed to work on my cardio and stretching :D ) I've written and self published a book. Created a youtube channel that reviews video games that has 27 videos so far. I'm forming new relationships, like meeting my girlfriend (we have been together for a year) and being kinder and more patient with people in general.

I've been productive. I haven't been wallowing in my own self pity hoping the world would come to me. I go out and happen to the world now. You can too. If any of this seems like something you desire, something you want, you can have it too. Go out there and be yourself. You dont need to hide behind a glass or bottle. Just go out with the mindset of wanting to be better, to heal, to become who you are meant to be. The rest will work itself out.",12

2020-02-08 12:23:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f0ul6k/sober_forever/,Sober Forever (?),"**This is how I dealt with the ""forever"" in of ""staying sober forever"", and whether or not (and when) I'd feel I could try moderation. I'm sharing it because this worked for me, do whatever works for you.**

## Problem
I [27M] quit drinking completely in May last year.
After a few weeks of sobriety I observed that the ""forever"" in staying sober forever gave rise to some pessimism about my chances to succeed and discouraged me a bit. Not just because ""forever"" is really daunting, but also because permanent sobriety is not achievable within your lifetime: there will never be an ""I did it!"" moment. Additionally, at 27 years old, I couldn't even pretend to have an idea of what me and my life will be like 10, 20 or even 5 years from now. I just can't justify making a definitive decision now about myself that far in the future.

For many people simply doing it one day at a time seems to work (counting days definitely helped me get through the initial weeks) and each individual should do whatever works best for for them, I found that IWNDWYT just doesn't give me confidence for the long-term. It would mean I'd have take a decision on whether or not to continue my sobriety each day again. Some days I feel a bit overconfident in myself, so then I could very well make the decision to start drinking moderately too soon, setting me back a long way.

## Solution
So instead of the making a decision each day, I made the decision to stay sober for the rest of the year and that at the end of that period I would honestly evaluate my experiences with sobriety and choose to either continue for another year, after which I'd do this same evaluation again, or cautiously attempt moderation and going back to sobriety for the rest of the year immediately if I'd sense I might go off track.
Setting clear checkpoints in time on which to make decisions about sobriety and putting enough time between choice and temptation can greatly reduce the persuasive power of arguments like ""This is a unique occasion."", ""I've been sober for a long time now!"" or ""Just this one time.""; which might persuade you some of the times.
In more details, the approach I took was:
- Honestly write down all your issues which caused you to (or might cause you) drink. Are they still present?
- Honestly write down all the reasons for starting to drinking again. Is there a good and persuasive reason?
- Honestly, do you think you can do moderation and would you detect a possible relapse early?
If the answer to any of the questions is no, stay sober until some a new date where you'll re-evaluate again.
If all the answers are yes, you can try moderation if you want. Make clear rules of what you'd consider a relapse (drinking alone, drinking before 6pm, *looking for a loophole in your rules*, … whatever) and unconditionally hold yourself to them. If you'd fail, there's no shame in going back to sobriety, it was an experience which taught you that you still can't do moderation, and hopefully you also discovered another reason you can add to the answers of the questions above.

In my case: all problems which caused me to drink were either gone or greatly reduced (yay!).
The one reason to start drinking again that I could think of was that I'm more sociable with a few drinks because I'm usually very inhibited. As a counterargument, I'd rather work being sociable sober, anyplace and anytime. So, while it's a reason, it wasn't a good and persuasive one.
Finally: I still have trouble doing moderation, I still finish a bag of crisps the day I buy it. Because alcohol removes inhibitions, moderation with alcohol is more difficult than crisps. This is the most dominant argument for me right now: I'm not confident that I could have a few beers and leave it at that, and I still drink too fast.
So I decided that I would remain sober in 2020, and not attempt moderation.

## Miscellaneous Thoughts
Picking a date 8 months after starting sobriety was a really good decision. Had I picked a much shorter period, then I wouldn't have been far enough to make an informed decision, had the period been too long and it would have felt just as daunting as forever. After 8 months, my struggle with habits was over (no more ""Feel bad? Have a drink!"" reflex), so this mostly helps me conquer the more subtle temptations that occasionally tempt me nowadays.

Be honest with yourself and making it a real decision. Not having the outcome ready before properly weighing the pros and cons is crucial. It may be less ""safe"" for maintaining your sobriety, but genuine honesty is the only way the decision will carry enough persuasive power for you to fall back on it later if you feel like drinking/moderating. I regularly thought about doing moderation in the mean time, genuinely believing I could do it. The counterargument ""I made a well-thought out choice, and I'll stick with sobriety at least until the next checkpoint."" only works well if you know your decision was one of honest consideration.

I made this up myself, I've actually read up very little on addiction and alcohol, but it helped to keep my dedication to sobriety strong, and I'm fairly sure it kept me from trying moderation too soon. I just want to repeat that you should do what (you think) works best for you. If you don't like this approach at all, try something else. If you have another question besides my three you also find important, add it (and leave a comment for me and others).

Also, this perspective only helped me with this particular challenging aspect of sobriety, there are many other aspects.

**TL;DR**: If you have trouble with the ""forever"" part of sobriety and are toying with the idea of moderation, pick a date in the future until which you definitely want to and feel able you can stay sober, preferably at least 6 months from the start of your sobriety. On this date, be brutally honest with yourself on whether you think you can start doing moderation. If any of the reasons you decided quit are still applicable, you can't find a good reason to start again, or you don't think you can do moderation, fix a new period (e.g. one year) where you will stay sober and after which you'll revisit the decision again. If all lights for moderation are green, you can try it (but remain cautious!).",6

The hardest part of becoming a new person is letting the old person die. I haven't had a drink for 728 days but I still am a drunk.  I have yet to change the image of myself. Some people who quit learn to hate the poison we put in our bodies.  I still long for it.
2. Once I decided to quit drinking, it took me almost 4 years before I had more than 30 days in a row sober.  Don't quit, quitting. 
3. Stopdrinking, gave me the strength to make it this far.  So many times in the beginning I was close to drinking.  Posting here and saying that I will not drink with you today, some how really helped me.
4. Replying to others posts and believing I was helping, in return helped me.
5. There is no one size fit all alcoholic.  I understand my personal demon.  It is the initial dopamine hit I get from the first sip.  It's not even the alcohol.   It's the fluid of warmth and release.
6. I don't like being drunk or high.  As strange as it sounds, there were times when I started drinking after ""quitting"" and the first night I would say to myself, I don't like this feeling. I got over it.  After giving up alcohol, I did try other means of getting high.  I didn't like the feeling either.
7. There is a thing called They Sinclair Method that has helped many people.
8. Kratom satisfied my desire for the slight endorphin hit.  I quickly started using every day and had to quit that as well.
9. I have yet to learn how to accept living in discomfort.  I continually look for an easy fix.
10. Everyone I meet is struggling with something.  Try not to take things personally and be kind.",11

Last night was the first time that I had a powerful urge to drink. Work has been rough for the last couple of weeks and as I was getting ready to leave another problem lands in my lap. I call the customer back and all I'm getting is attitude, so I gave it right back to her. Not great customer service, I know, but there is no benefit in disrespecting somebody that is trying to help you.  On the drive home, I'm feeling guilty about how I treated that customer, and just general anxiety. I'm thinking why am I even going home, I should just keep on driving south till I hit the ocean. 

I get home and I'm sitting there stewing in my own juices, too much pent up energy and nowhere to go. Normally, I would have drank vodka like it was my job when I was feeling like that. Last night, I said fuck it, going on a night ride. I ride bikes and there is a trail pretty close to my house, so despite my wife not thrilled with my decision, I geared up and hit the trail. Rode for a couple of hours with lights. Took in the nearly full snow moon and just got that energy out. I was almost run over by a mustang on the way home, but I'd take that over drinking again. I attribute my decision to the inspiration and support I found in this community.  Thanks to everyone who puts their stories out there. It really helps.",10

It’s come down to just being an annoyance and a shitty replacement for my actual needs. My quitting and my recovery has DEFINITELY reigned in my out-of-control-can’t-ever-stop-once-i-start behavior. 

A new opportunity has fallen into my lap (actually due to a friend of my sponsor) and it has somehow really affected my drive and excitement. My old career had me seriously in the dumps. Hopeless.

I feel very much indebted to my sponsor and feel a duty to be the best i can be at this. I can’t afford any lack of mental clarity.

I'm 25 years old guy from Poland, which has a heavy drinking culture and it's definitely not cool to not be drinking here. I started drinking when I was 15, but I wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic per se - I drink only with friends, every other weekend or so. But as you can imagine being Polish, when we drink, we often drink a lot. One morning, when I woke up with puke on my sheets and clothes scattered around the bed I've decided enough is enough. I didn't remember how I got there, last thing I remember was drinking vodka in a club. Apparently my friend escorted me in a taxi to my house. That was 77 days ago and I haven't touch alcohol ever since - went to a birthday party, when everyone drank either vodka, beer or both, survived Christmas, when you drink with your family to ""celebrate"" and didn't go anywhere for New Year's Eve, because I was tired of partying. But the thing is - today I go to another party, hosted by the same friend that escorted me to home last time. For some context - we're friends from university and this is a party ""sponsored"" by money that he received for referring me to our company, where we work together. So we're celebrating this today, finishing our degrees soon and so on. And I'm torn whether I should drink today or not. It's definitely heavy drinking party, we plan to go to the same club as before. Part of me is tempted to drink, I don't like being the only one sticking out, and it's not like I will drink every day afterwards. The second part of me wants to not drink, stick to my decision, and that I shouldn't need alcohol to have fun, even at the club. What do you think?",6

2020-02-08 09:25:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f0s7yk/i_went_to_medical_detox/,I went to medical detox,"For about 2 years now, I've been a pint-a-day whiskey drinker (sometimes more).   I knew it was unhealthy, probably very unhealthy.    I kept cutting back but the afternoon anxiety attacks were killing me.    I never made a real change because nothing bad ever really happened.    Sure, I missed work now and then, but they were forgiving.   Sure, I got mystery bruises now and then, but nobody really noticed.   Sure, I was irritable and checked-out as a husband and father, but people get used to that.

There were no major consequences to my habit, so nothing changed.   Strangely I thought I was too busy for detox and it was probably just a bunch of AA bullshit anyway.   And anyway, if it was really helpful, then why doesn't everybody go?   It's probably not for me.

So about 2 weeks ago I got my own fancy idea.    I got on the internet and researched the medications used in detox.    I logged onto <redacted highly illegal website> and ordered a bunch of <redacted benzo>.    My plan was to take the benzo when I felt like drinking, and then I wouldn't drink, and then I'd only be left with a benzo habit that I know how to taper.

What my Google Medical Degree failed to anticipate is the behavior of the addict brain.    If drug A feels good, then I bet twice as much A feels twice as good.    If drug B feels good, then I bet A + B feels like some amazing C.    Chasing the high takes over everything.

So apparently I had 7 drinks of whiskey and probably 6 tabs of a benzo that is normally taken daily, just listening to vintage New Order on YouTube and wishing it was old times again.

Anyhow, the next morning I woke up in my bed with 2 huge abrasions on my face and a pissed-off wife who says ""this is the last straw"".      (God bless this woman, for 2 weeks she's been getting insurance papers in order instead of divorce papers).    I took the insurance papers and went to Peachford hospital in Atlanta.   (You should totally go there).

The process itself made detox a lot easier.   I was in for 4 days total.    They prescribed the right kind of meds, they made me take it at the right time, they filled the day with sobriety-oriented stuff  I met some great humans and fellow addicts there, I could fill another post about that alone.   (Don't get me wrong - it is a little bit carceral.    No belts, shoelaces, electronics, no free access to your own spaces.    But not more carceral than necessary).

So I entered feeling like a garbage human, and I left feeling like I have a real shot.

I also want to mention that they introduced me to naltrexone.   (Actually I went with the YOLO vivitrol injection instead of the pill so that I couldn't skip a daily dose).     Naltrexone is interesting.    On the way home, I had no choice but to drive by my favorite liquor store.    Usually it's a devil-angel struggle whether to stop, and I normally lose that mental battle.    This time I didn't even think about it.   I also admit to some porn overuse, and I decided to test how that was after detox.   I really got nothing out of the porn.   I'm no MD but I suspect it's the way Vivitrol disrupts the interaction with the dopamine and opioid receptors.

So I am glad that I committed to the Vivitrol injection.   I'm not going to try drinking on it but I feel a lot safer and urge-resistant with it.

I wanted to write more but we had a surprise snowfall and I'm going to go enjoy it with my kids, sober for once.",19

This week was demanding in ways that would have made me curl up into a misery ball had I been drinking. Instead, I powered through it with just a little tiredness but absolutely zero stress.

No productivity lost to hangovers.

My weight loss plateau finally broke and I have lost seven more pounds of extra weight without losing any muscle mass.

My male RBF is gone. When I unexpectedly see my reflection, there is a slight resting smile.

My hair is healthier and thicker.

My face looks younger and overall bodily skin tone is improved.

I feel 10 years younger mentally and physically.

Work productivity is increased.

Thinking is clearer and complex ideas are more easily understood.

Navigated several social events without embarassing myself. Had good times and drove people home safely. 

No shame over drunken oversharing. No morning cringes.

Depression lifted. No fantasizing about becoming a hobo or killing myself. 

General feeling of optimism has replaced pessimism. 

More control over life in general, which leads to more confidence.

There are more benefits, but I think this list captures the big ones. The benefits started the first week, but at this point they are really accruing. This is not my first sobriety attempt, but it is the first booze-free month for me since 2017. I think this is going to be the one that sticks.  Life is just SO much better for me without alcohol.

If you are thinking about quitting or struggling to string together some time, perhaps this testimony will be helpful. Keep on keeping on.",25

The thing that helped most was to stop drinking. No doctor, appointment, or pill required!","I feel like sharing my story since everyone here is a part of it. A few years ago I was REALLY struggling with depression. I had gained a ton of weight (50 pounds) and was not doing well at work or in relationships.  I tried a number of things. Therapy with a bunch of different types of therapists, meditation, “positive thinking” books, you name it, I bought it and tried it.  Lots of time & $ spent figuring out how to feel better. 

Somewhere along the line I found this cool sub, and read about all of you who were clearly happier and less depressed NOT drinking. “Yeah, but you’re not an alcoholic, Lewis.”  I said to myself. Damn, then why do I relate with nearly every post here? I lurked here and I went along using alcohol as a crutch, trying to moderate. I noticed it messed with my sleep, even just 1 which was hard to moderate like that. Bad sleep equals tired, depressed, eating sugar. I talked to my therapist a psychologist who claimed drinking a few now and then wouldn’t hurt. But it DID. So I finally got the courage to embrace being 100% alcohol free from this sub!  *uck my therapist who said it shouldn’t make a difference in my depression. Guess what? Alcohol is a known depressant dipshop, and I’m extremely depressed! Shouldn’t need an advanced degree to make the connection that cutting it out will help.  

The daily decision (about 6 months ago) not to drink has been so empowering. Being alcohol free isn’t always easy (sure, but I wasn’t an alcoholic, ha!) but it has helped with my depression more than any other single thing.  And it’s FREE (not counting all the diet root beer of course) and doesn’t require anything. I travel a lot and my sobriety is 100% portable!   I take it everywhere and no stupid doctor or therapist or pill gave it to me.  I feel like it’s a huge DUH! that so many people are missing. I really just have a lot of gratitude for this sub for helping me own and embrace my sobriety. TY r/stopdrinking. IWNDWYT.",734

I was out at a club last night ( I live in Berlin ) and was doing quite fine without the booze. I won’t lie clubs are always hard! The promise of a little numbing is tempting in such an intense space but... I was doing well and thankfully Berlin has a lot of non alcoholic options in bars (non alcoholic beer / club mate etc). 

Anyways at one side bar where they sold food and other refreshments they had a sign ‘Ginger Shot 2 euros’. Awesome I though, an intense ginger shot would feel good right now, my energy is a little low. 

One shot later - I realize it tastes sweet and wasn’t at all that hard to drink. 

Immediately I tasted alcohol. Fuck... 

I started to panic. It’s been 8 months and the first drink is a shot! Man I was really heartbroken... 

The bar was terribly misleading, I went to confirm it has booze and they were like yup! Oh sorry no darling, it’s not a health shot... 

Man. Honestly I hate how nice it felt! Ugh I was hoping for otherwise but of course a shot felt warm and fuzzy... but it also reminded me that this feeling I’m getting with the shot - I want to get here without it man. I want to feel these calmed nerves without it. My anxiety is rough... it’s always been the main reason I drink. I feel I had an anxiety issue first and foremost, a drinking one second.

I thought everyone drank like me. I’m not even sure when it started. I just always remember drinking.

At the same time that I’m coming to grips with being an alcoholic, I am also trying to understand why I am one. The best conclusion I have so far is; I use alcohol to cope with myself. It's possible I wasn’t always an alcoholic, but somewhere along the way I used alcohol to deal with being myself.

It was supposed to be me expressing how making them unhappy brought me back to when I was younger and incidences where I was wracked by fear. Not to blame them, but to say that I have this association in my brain that is not really a true representation of our relationship and that I have been trying to work past it. I thought it went well. Being open and addresssing fear.  It did not. It turned into a disaster and now the relationship has been damaged.

I’ve said I was going to get sober before then just gave myself an excuse to drink after 1-2 weeks.

This time I had hundreds and hundreds of empty sparkling water bottles- not one beer bottle(well that I drunk).

Snuck a chicken sandwich into the theater, watched a movie I really liked again. Rode home, ate ice cream and popcorn then binged movies.

I could never get the words out... ""I don't drink anymore."" It was like I was afraid to say it. It meant a complete lifestyle change that I wasn't ready to pour the cement on. 

This is the longest I have been sober in a year. I did 30 days last year with the promise of a drink on day 31. In 2 days it will be the longest I have been sober in 14 years. I can't wait. 

I've been getting to know myself this month. I learned I have a lot more energy than I thought. I learned that I actually laugh more freely while sober. I learned that saying the words and actually meaning it lifts a weight from my shoulders that I honestly thought I would carry forever. 

Just 30 days sober has been the hardest and most rewarding journey of my adult life. Getting through the first week was the hardest. Learning about what triggers the cravings was next. Learning to reach out when I needed it helped me keep going. 

I can't thank this community enough. The candid support I received in some of my darkest moments is something I will never forget. To every person that has shared their story, thank you! 

I'm looking forward to the days ahead. I know there will be challenges, but I can do this. I don't drink anymore and I will not drink with you today!",9

This isn't the first time this has happened and it wasn't the worst, but it's the first time since I stopped drinking. My problems aren't unique - heartbreaking family problems hundreds of miles away and really bad problems at work. 

However, I am talking with an amazing woman for the first time in years. Some may call it stoicism, but the truth is I disconnected emotionally from the world to protect myself. It's the only thing I knew to do to maintain sobriety. This new relationship has opened up a lot of emotions recently and they spilled out yesterday. It was messy. 

Damn I wanted to drink so badly - or do anything that could take the edge off of that emotional rollercoaster. I passed three liquor stores on the way home, worked out, took a long hot bath, and just wrote. I wrote for hours about everything I was feeling until it all made sense to me. I was tired and ready for bed before I realized I no longer had the urge to drink.

Alcohol might make you feel better while you are buzzed but it can cause so much more harm than good. 

I’m wondering how others treat disclosing alcoholism, being open and honest about it in order to help other people (in my case, my employees). Only my immediate family, therapist and medical professionals know about my struggle with alcoholism right now but I wonder if going more public about it will help hold me accountable.

Tough Lessons Learned,"TLDR; Tonight Inlearned that the negative feelings I have while drunk are the same ones I have sober. But because I was sober, I have found an opportunity to work through those feelings differently. 

----‐--- 
I decided to go out tonight. I mentioned in a previous post that most of the social interaction I get is at bars since I live in a small town. Since I had some free time I figured I'd go see some friends. One of them invited me out after I already made the decision so I just hung with them for a while.

The good news is that I stuck to not drinking. I had water, a non-alcoholic beer, and a red bull. I had no urge to be drunk or have a drink.

The bad news is that my drunk anxieties are my sober realities. Most of the people I considered friends weren't really that excited to see me at all. The friend that invited me out ditched me for a party of a mutual friend that I wasnt invited to, and another friend decided to throw a party that I also wasnt invited to.

People I thought I was cool with just basically didnt acknowledge me at all. The body language and looks from people made me feel more or less unwanted around. I was lonely by the end of the night.

In a way, I see it as a positive. I would feel this way drunk too, but act on it differently. Probably inserting myself where I thought I may be wanted but was probably just being tolerated, being passive aggressive, and so on. Now I know my feelings are legitimate, and it still hurts. Dont get me wrong, but I'm not in a drunken fury, crying, or drowning my feelings in poison only to repress them until next time.

The problem is the same drunk or sober, but the solution is going to be different, better, BECAUSE I experienced this sober and can see that alcohol would've changed nothing for the better.

Maybe I have to sit in these feelings for a while and accept being alone. Maybe if time allows I'll try therapy again or something. At least now I know 100% that drinking isnt the answer. That's worth something. 

The hardest part of this journey is gonna be facing my negative feelings head on, and I suspect that may be the case for a lot of us, but I can tell you all with confidence and now some experience that our solution lies elsewhere.",9

I also have a young nephew, 15, who keeps me ""in the loop"" with mumble rap or whatever or new rap in general. 

I took quickly to Juice Wrld. [He sang about drugs in a realistic way](https://youtu.be/5SejM_hBvMM) and I got out a lot of my teenage angst through him heh.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

It's been wonderful hosting the DCI this week. It's always inspiring! The strength and compassion in our group is truly special.

 My week is up so if you have at least 30 sober days and would like to host, please let me know and I'll pass your info on.  I'll see you all next time! I will not drink with you today.",64

Well, today is four years, I was planning on doing a four year post highlighting ups and downs and lessons I've learned but, that will have to be put on the backburner because puppy.

Well what a week!  Trump cleared, Iowa pointing to reprehensible incompetency at best, and CoV 2019 continues it's path.  My daughter's principal has left the school, not sure if she was fired or quit, anyways it's a net positive.

And Judge threw out my child support case, and I'm the one who filed for child support so not good for me.  I could go on and on about the injustice of the situation, but due to the dot of i on line 35.b1 of form 14 F 292 not being present the case was thrown out.  I'll take it on the chin and carry on.  It's out of my control at the moment and have more pressing issues.

I'm on overnights right now so it's been grueling mentally and physically along with starting a new job in new career.  I'm going to have a wait and see as to how things play out.  One shift at a time.

Tonight, drop off daughter at my Dad's, then off to work!  Hopefully be able to witness full moon setting, and sun rising.  

If you're drinking and/or doing drugs, THC included, not judging but please don't post about it on here!  And posting from laptop so all type o's are a result of carelessness on my part.

I felt good from just being real about it. And there wasn't any weird follow up questions. He said that's tough because relaxing and drinking is so enjoyable. I said Oh yeah!

I can feel the specific, red hot shame of this latest incident merging into the background, general shame of having a disordered relationship with alcohol.

I understand that this is a normal mental  process, however I am keen to use this incident as the catalyst for lasting change - rather than let it fade from view and forget it.

I feel like a sham and a wicked, weak man for having started off so many times with genuine intentions but having reverted to undesirable patterns of behaviour in each case.

I have had a number of successful periods being AF previously- I am compiling the techniques and routines that have worked for me in the past.

Among them is daily engagement with peer support (hence my numerous recent posts here).

I am going to an AA meeting on Monday evening- have never done this before. Perhaps this will suit me.

One important daily routine is a pledge each morning and a review/journal each evening. I have found the I am sober app useful for this.

I am trying to reframe my relationship with alcohol in my own mind:

-alcohol is a wily enemy whom I must defeat

-to pick up the next drink is to abandon my duties to family, career, self etc

-the next drink is the one that will destroy my marriage, relationship with my child, career etc

-alcohol is not fun anymore and has caused me untold harm over the years

I am giving thought to the damage alcohol does to your physical and mental health - this is obvious for weeks after a binge.

The main thing is to keep the issue front of mind each day- I have failed in the past when I have let it slip from view and comforted myself with thoughts that everyone has fuck ups or that on some imaginary scale I’m at the lighter end.",7

After a wicked dive into booze last weekend, I’ve had a rough week. I’ve had the routine physical withdrawals: nervous system a wreck, emotions out of control, unable to deal with stress or even not stress. This time it was physically scary and almost unbearable cos I have no support system.

Left my career (high workload, intensive travel) and the job search is bleak but getting better. 
 
I eventually decided to taper (light beer) because cold turkey I was waking up with my room destroyed. Insomnia and I was lashing out and breaking stuff trying to go 24 hours without liquor.

I’ll be done tomorrow with the taper schedule. Mostly I feel fine but I was really scared about my sickness. I can beat this.

I’d like some help with setting up a physical routine from where I live for after I’m done with this. I can’t join a gym, but I do have good running shoes and a yoga mat and some free weights.

and...
felt this incredible sense of achievement. I giggled and my body shook with adrenaline.

Anyway, if a counter, anniversaries and/or sobrietychips help you stay sober, cool. If they make you feel bad over your relapse, don't sweat it. The most important thing is today. There's no perfect way, none of us have all the answers, but we're all rooting for each other, and that's the most important thing.",16

2020-02-07 17:05:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/f0hs90/i_relapsed_word_of_warning/,I Relapsed - Word of Warning,"Hai Friends,

A badge reset is in order. I had my first drink in over 27 months a few weeks ago in January.   


I was an addict because of deep emotional and social issues that I have been working on fixing since I got sober. I mostly consider myself healed (or on the right track). Since I wasn't worried about behaviorally becoming an addict again, I assumed I could reintroduce alcohol into my life socially without much issue.

I was wrong. Since that day in January when I had my first drink, I have drank on probably 10 or 12 occasions. I very quickly realized that I was constantly feeling awful for days at a time and I only felt better when I would have a drink or two. I chalked it up to being sick and alcohol taking the edge off. This culminated this week when I ended my relationship with my abusive father for good, and ended up drinking throughout the day on Tuesday. I did not have a lot, probably 6 or 7 drinks in a 12 hour period at most. At my worst I regularly consumed 50+ servings a day, so this seemed like nothing.

However, it was not nothing. Last night when trying to go to sleep the 'sick' feeling I've been fighting revealed itself as so much more. I began a cold sweat, my heartbeat jumped up to 150, and I began having slight auditory and visual hallucinations. I started shaking slightly, and the rush of energy and confusion possesing my brain signaled to me I was at risk of a seizure. I now understood I have not been sick with an illness, but instead developing alcohol withdrawal.

This disease came very close to killing me in 2017, and I now understand that I can never have any amount of alcohol again. Even after decades sober, one drink would set me on the path back to withdrawal and the cyclic addiction that is the ruin of so many amazing men and women.

Today I called all my doctors, missed work for being 'sick' for the first time in three years (I DONT get sick), and am now on my way again to recovery. There is a 24 hour stabilization unit in my neighborhood that my doctor has reserved a spot for me in, so if things get hairy again I have somewhere to go. For now though, I have been taking a Gabapentin every 12 hours to prevent seizure, and am trying to take advantage of this time off to relax.

I know the only way to overcome this problem is to face it head on. Be honest and vulnerable with myself and the community of people I have surrounded myself with that are now my family. This was a lesson I could only have learned the hard way, and I am so thankful this ended when it did.

Today, and everyday moving forward IWNDWYT",26

To start off, I live in Arizona. The state takes drunk driving very seriously & in many cases jail time is mandatory. In my case, I was given a ""super extreme DUI"" which means my BAC was above 0.2%. It doesn't matter how clean your record is, even as a first time offender you're facing some harsh consequences. The mandatory minimum is 45 days, but many end up serving 6 months to 2 years.

I'm 23 years old. I've been drinking for what feels like a long time for my age. I picked it up at age 11, got expelled at age 14 for drinking at school, & eventually got alcohol poisoning one night at age 16. Seeing my mom cry & begging me to stop was enough to make me quit. I scared the shit out of her that night & I didn't want to see that again. However, that attempt only lasted 2 years. During that time it was easy to say no. Then one night I had a drink & I haven't stopped since.

I don't drink liquor because of the alcohol poisoning incident. I stick to beer, because I don't trust myself with liquor. Even knowing that, I still never really accepted alcoholism as being a problem. I've been up & down with my intake over the years. At some points it was every day, at others it was twice a week or so. Every time I do drink, its usually 40 ounces or more.. usually more. I'm well controlled (or so I think) & I dont get crazy. Usually I'm just relaxing, talking with people, just with a drink in my hand. I couldn't count how many times I've gone driving after being buzzed or drunk. I've done it so much I never even worried about it.

Then on Saturday I was spending time with family after my grandmothers funeral. Everybody started drinking so I joined too. I didn't keep track of how much I had, but I know it was 7 or more before we left to another relatives house & continued there. Thats when I started to have small gaps in my memory. I remember everyone there, & what we were doing, but I hardly remember a lot of what we talked about. Anyway, I was there for an hour before I started heading home. I got on the freeway & I remember driving in a straight line, going 70mph. Everything seemed fine from my point of view. The last thing I remember is hitting my blinker & switching lanes to the left, nice & clean, no loss of control that I can remember. Then suddenly I'm looking around, seeing that I'm sideways in the fast lane with the car smashed into the median. My first thought was ""Oh shit, I can't be in the road like this, I need to move"". I reached for the shifter & seen that it was snapped off. ""Fuck... Theres no moving this... Oh fuck.."" I looked at the smoke coming out of the front. The hood was folded. It started hitting me that I just wrecked my car & theres no getting out of this. I'm screwed. I didn't realize I was bleeding until I touched my face & saw my hand covered in blood. I looked down & saw it dripping on the floor, but I knew I was lucky because if I wasn't I wouldn't be up & walking around. It turns out the blood was from my forehead. My head hit the windshield & the glass cut me up. Luckily it was nothing that needed stitches. The cops wrapped my head up before arresting me & taking me in.

I'm thankful that the only person I hurt was myself. I'd never forgive myself if I had hurt anybody else. Theres a lot of speeding on the freeway. I could've killed somebody. I could've killed myself. I don't know how I'm even okay after hitting a wall at 70mph. Honestly, I'm more hurt on the inside than on the outside. I'm so disappointed in myself.  I keep reimagining sitting in that front seat & realizing what had happened. Seeing my bloody can of beer. I dont think I'll ever forget that feeling. I have to go to court at the end of the month & I fear what my consequences will be. I've never been in jail for more than a night. I'm gonna have to get used to day after day, week after week... more than likely month after month.

One thing that's for sure is I *do* have a problem. I had 1 beer during the Super Bowl & I didn't have any more even after being pressured to. I bought a tea to keep in my hand instead. Then two days ago I bought a 15 pack of 16oz cans. I drank 4 that night, then another 4 last night, alone. I don't even know how I can drink after how shitty I feel about myself.

I want to quit, but I still have a hard time thinking its possible. Part of me still thinks its fine & I could handle myself. Everybody thinks that though. That night of the accident, I thought I was fine & I wasn't. I'm not sure what I expect out of this post. If you read until the end, thanks for letting me vent. I hope everybody is on a better path than mine recently.",42

I've had scattered successes, and while drugs are a big part of my story, alcohol is the focal point and lubricant for all the other debauchery. I've maintained a work life and some quality friendships, but all my romantic interests have been complete failures due to my sometimes erratic or unreasonable behaviors. I've become extremely depressed and anxious, and often have suicidal thoughts or daydreams. 

This back and forth dance is an unacceptable way of living life. I've had numerous friends from AA suggest going to treatment. They also are fearful I will end my life. I always downplay these sentiments by trying to say, it's not that bad guys. I'm not that bad off. I'm ok. I just want to die when Im not drinking and snorting and smoking. No big deal right? Pff..so insane. I've posted here a number of times over this journey, and I wanted to share here today that Im checking into a treatment center tomorrow.

I cannot imagine what this would be like if I was still drinking. I honestly cannot imagine where I would be in life if I hadn't quit. There have certainly been points where I have thought, fuck it, why not. I can always continue being sober, but I know I cannot support myself while I am drunk.

""The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his  drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The  persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the  gates of insanity or death.""

I am a decade sober and the  statement above still enters my mind. A lot of people who have been  sober for some time say they dont miss drinking. I ain't one of those  people. I miss drinking a nice beer or a good whiskey. Drinking with  friends, drinking alone. Drinking in general.

 The problem is, when I think about drinking, I think about drinking 18  beers or the big bottle of whiskey. That is where my head takes me. That  is why I remind myself daily that I can't have just one. Hell, I don't  even know what just one is of anything! One is too many and one hundred  isn't enough. So I keep my guard up for the first one and the rest works  itself out.

I dont miss the hangovers,  the apologies, the  arrests, the jails, the one phone call, the court dates, the probation  officer,  the being on paper, the money spent on all the previously  mentioned. It simplify it, I dont miss the consequences.

A lot  has changed in myself over the last decade. Some has not. I still work  on what I need to change and let go of what I can't. 

I do not  relate to the person I was ten years ago. Some people still carry a  grudge against that guy. I understand and hope someday they can let it  go. Not for me but for themselves. That guy was very comfortable being  uncomfortable.  Now I am only slightly comfortable being uncomfortable.  Stubbornness & pride are the main cause for that. Like I said, I am  working on it.

I dont have a lot of recovery post, have a bumper  sticker on my car, no shirts, no big book thumping, Not because I am not  proud of it but soo many people know how I was living a decade ago  versus how I live today. Recovery is attraction not promotion.  

 If you find yourself needing help, reach out for help. Starting is the  hard part. A.A. has a saying called the responsibility statement it goes  .“I am Responsible. When anyone, anywhere, reaches out for help, I want  the hand of A.A. always to be there. And for that: I am responsible.”

Just reach out, help is out there.

I’m on day 25 and I’ve been doing really, really well. I’ve been proud of my alcohol-free streak and have been reading This Naked Mind and listening to the podcast and feeling so, so happy and empowered. I finally felt freedom from all of the things that I didn’t even realize were weighing me down about drinking and I thought I would really never want a drink again. I was looking forward to a bright, sober La Croix lifestyle and feeling euphoric about it. I even made it through several weekends which is a big deal for me, as I only ever drank on the weekends. 

But then we got to THIS weekend, and those thoughts have been creeping in. I know this is almost a universal experience and I’ve read many other posts but I still find myself needing support. My SO and I are going to an arcade tonight. It’s attached to a bar and we’ve been before and I’ve drank there and I find myself looking forward to it FOR the drinks and not to spend time with someone I love. When I remember I can’t have a drink I get sad and don’t look forward to it as much. I find myself going “maybe just one?” although I know it won’t be just one and I’m so proud of being AF for 25 days and I know I’ll regret it and feel sad and disappointed in myself. I KNOW all of these things but still - that thought keeps popping up. It’s all sick and it makes me so sad that I think like this. 

She really wants to go, it’s one of her favorite places in the world, so I don’t want to tell her I can’t handle it.    I know this is all part of the process of changing your mindset. I know better and still there’s a part of my brain that goes “yeah but what if you just had ONE?” and I just feel so tired of having to tell that part of my brain to shut up.

And then I ratted myself out to people in recovery and flushed it. Didn’t think anymore, and just did it. 
That was the first time I came face to face with a drink or drug and I was by myself. 

But I want to have a clear conscience today. As much as I wanted that fucking pill. And as much as I want to go into a bar every day. Or a liquor store. And want to get loaded. I want a clear conscience and to feel better. I knew that pill wouldn’t do shit. Just like one drink won’t either. When I found it, I immediately wished I had found more than just one.

I remind myself that a fantastic sober nights sleep is oblivion. That a hilarious sober conversation with someone I love (the kind where it’s hard to catch your breath from laughing) is oblivion. The moment I crest a hill on a hard run/ride and my endorphins go nuts is oblivion.

Applies to most areas - that tour of Iraq/Afghan? You hated most of it but look back with fondness/pride. Why? FAB.

And alcohol. For me I have done several stints of sobriety, varying from 50 to 120 plus days. But the longer I go the more I look back and think ""those times weren't so bad"", ""see, I can go without"", ""how good were those nights in the pub back then"". 

And then I become gradually more likely to then go ""well I deserve a pint now"", ""it's not so much of a big deal"", ""I've had a healthy break"", ""I can moderate from now on"".

I have found the first few weeks easier than the long haul bit where you look back with fondness and almost forget the whole reason you are doing this in the first place. And then end up back at square one, when moderation inevitably peters out and you are back where you left off.

Well, knowledge dispels fear. Another one in the armoury.

We need to remember why we are doing this and keep our guard up.

I (46F) drink 2 to 3 glasses of wine every night. I never get drunk but I'm certainly tipsy and I get antsy for it around dinner time every evening.

I suffer from insomnia and often wake up in the middle of the night feeling hungover. This exhaustion and headache often carries over into the next day.

I have an internal struggle over quitting - I do want to quit because I want to sleep better and feel better but I don't have a strong impetus because my drinking is not causing major damage to my life and relationships. In fact many of my friends and family celebrate this amount of intake and encourage me to join them. I also feel that being a fun social drinker is part of my identity and I'm often playfully teased about my love for wine.

I agreed because I felt a change of venue would do me good, I love her dog and who wouldn’t want to stay in a stunning mansion for a few days. I got there yesterday and the housekeeper showed me around before she left for the day. After she left, I carefully locked the mudroom door, unlocked the front door and my car with the fob and went to get my stuff from the car, leaving my coat, phone and keys in the house. Yup, you guessed it. The door slammed shut locking me out. I had no way to call anyone or even start my car to keep warm! I couldn’t call the housekeeper because my phone was in the house and I  don’t even know her last name!!! 
OMG the panic!! I thought about breaking a window..but figured  I would check them all first. I finally found the small mud room window about 7 feet off the ground was unlocked!!! Now it’s snowing. Hard. I am freezing. I dragged the garbage bin underneath the window and crawled onto it. Somehow by hanging on to the top of the gate and sliding my legs through the window, I was halfway in....all my gym time has paid off...but then my boots fell off so now I was hanging halfway in through a 12” opening barefoot and thought my spine was going to snap.  I couldn’t crawl back out because I was too far in and now barefoot and the snow is really coming down. I had no choice but to try to go forward.
I flailed my legs around and my foot hit the top of a large basket that they keep towels and dog stuff in and I was able to lower myself through while only removing a couple of layers of skin off my back LOL but I was back in!!!  Shaking. Literally trembling from the panic. 
All I could think about was having a very large slug of vodka. I didn’t care how many days I had been sober. I needed a damn drink. NOW.

Mine was alcoholism.  I've worked in bars since the age of 14 so I've been around alcohol all my life and blackouts were an every other night occurrence.  I used to think that I was a ""functioning alcoholic"" but as I'm typing this I just counted the amount of times I've gotten fired from jobs due to alcohol and it's been 6. Not to mention the toll it took on relationships, family, friends and nights in the drunk tank. So really the only ""functioning"" part was that I hadn't died yet, or committed a felony to be put behind bars. 

I cleaned up my act 2 years ago and went on my longest dry spell for almost a year (360 days) but then relapsed. Hard. Got fired from my job, and have $100 left to my name. That was about 3 weeks ago and I've been in limbo ever since. The shakes, sweats, and night terrors came right after I stopped my 4 day liquor bender. I sobered up and it dawned on me that I'm broke, unemployed, gf is about to walk out the door, and I'm pretty damn close to being homeless. 

Through pure luck and chance I landed not only 1 but 2 jobs and 1 offer benefits. I start one this sunday and awaiting the schedule for the 2nd this sat who've said they'd work around my other one. I've reset my badge here to reflect my days sober, and started working out to compliment my sobriety. 3 weeks ago I was terrified and engulfed in a heavy black shroud of guilt, fear, and anxiety. Today I'm X amount of days sober(I find it's best to not keep count), starting a new job (with benefits woo!) and like Batman in The Dark Knight Rises, scaling up the walls of sobriety. 

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that as cliche as it sounds, it DOES GET BETTER. The hardest part of going sober is that moment when you finally make up your mind and put the bottle down. The biggest battles happen you pass the liquor store and in that split second you have a decision to make. You know what the right decision is so like Nike, just do it. Walk away. 

Lastly, I wanna thank this community for sharing your stories and reaching out to me. The inspiration this community gives out is monumental. And a special thanks to a kind redditor who pm'ed me and said ""Hey, if you don't know how you're going to eat in the next few weeks, pm me and I got you"" While I didn't take him up on his offer (Rice, Beans, and chicken gang!) Such kindness from a complete stranger left me breathless. So whether you're thinking about cleaning up, or you're in the 4 digits clean, know that I am here to talk, know that we are here, and that WE GOT YOU.

It isn’t even the social pressure. 

It’s the forlorn concept of drinking in moderation. It’s the conviction that you will be able to control it this time. That you can be the person who enjoys a glass of wine with dinner, or settles down on a cold evening with a good whiskey to relax. To me, the knowledge that I will likely never be that person, having ruined alcohol for myself by the age of 20, is the most disheartening thing of all.

There also are no punishments for having a drink and not restarting, and there are no prizes for highest score.

I have not had a drink in almost a year, and it’s been the most meaningful, challenging, joyful year I can remember. If I decide to have a couple drinks on day 400, does that erase this year?

I've appreciated reading your posts for a while, but never thought I'd need to post. That is, until yesterday.  (Apologies for any formatting issues, I'm on mobile.)


Yesterday I woke up in the ER shaking and sweaty after a hellish night. I had arrived in the back of a police car with my 3yr old daughter, fearing death, for I had made a terrible mistake. A little background:

A few weeks ago my estranged mom died. About a year prior she was sent to a nursing home. Around that time I was able to go and collect a few of her things: like some old photos, books etc. I also hurriedly grabbed one of her old bags I'd always liked. 


Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago: It's been almost a year of drinking every night after (and during) a series of kicks to the ovaries by life, including the deaths of my dad and 2 friends. I don't realize how increasingly suicidal I've become. I don't realize how much my tolerance has truly built, how mediocre at best I've become as a mother to my incredible daughter. 


I was feeling some grief from my mom's pssing and decided to go through her things. In the bag I found, I discovered 2 pill bottles with a small amount of oxycontin inside. I freaked and didn't know what to do with them, so I stashed them away in my dresser and forgot about them.


The night before last, I remembered them. The night started out well, but soured with each rum and ginger I drank. My boyfriend and I got into a fight after which he stormed off. I put my daughter to bed and made way to my dresser. I popped a pill of the strongest oxy, my first time since the time I did it in high school and felt like I was going to die. 


I texted my boyfriend to come get our daughter and a few friends and family to say goodbye and laid down, awaiting my fate. That's when I heard a knock at the door followed by flashlights in the house. Two police officers had come to visit on a wellness check. By this point I had changed my mind on dying and asked to be taken to the ER. From there the trouble really began.


My boyfriend met me at the ER to collect my little girl. I went in and foolishly, if not rightfully, told them the truth about what had happened. The nurse violated HIPAA by calling CPS and telling them I had taken an oxycontin. The next day I was interviewed and a hearing was held. Temporary 30 day custody of my daughter was awarded to her deadbeat biological dad, who had never had any hand in raising her.


The sound of my sister, and brother-who has cried like 5x in his life- crying on the phone will forever scar my heart. I promised them then that in 30 days I will be 30 days sober.

I want your advice on whether its time for me to quit alcohol for good ? 
I have been an ocassional drinker (once in two weeks, which has turned to twice a week many a times) . I had been diagnosed with liver abscess 6- 7 years ago. Even though it has healed completely but it has made drinking difficult for me where it has become difficult for me to digest alcohol. Have been admitted to the hospital 2-3 times due to severe acidity and vomiting the day after drinking.
Secomdly, i find moderation very difficult. When i drink i drink until i pass out, which has also led to some embarassing moments.
Thirdly, i am currently depressed and have been taking medication for the same. Alcohol and antidepressants dont work well in my opinion. 

I would like to know your opinion on whether i should quit alcohol for good ? Or abstain from drinking for 3 to 6 months and then decide whether i should drink or not. I need your help. Thank you in advance

I would really appreciate your suggestions.",2

Last night I was nauseous and feeling like I was going to vomit. I was up and down all night with this feeling, but I never got sick. 

This morning I have a terrible headache. 

Not sure if it’s from not drinking or if I caught a bug.  I work in health care and I’m around sickness everyday. 

I decided to call out of work and just relax. Take the weekend and go back to work Monday and hopefully feel much better.  I never miss work, so it’s weird being home. 

I went to the doctors yesterday’ for a physical. The doc asked me if I was drinking more than socially.  Of course I said no. Some of my blood work for the blood cells are a little out of range.  I came home and did some research on alcohol and your blood cells.  Every time I drink, alcohol attacks my cells in my bone marrow. It messes them up or kills them. It destroys you from the cellular level. 

I’m done drinking. I have wine and beer in the house and I could give two shits about it. 

I was treated for low iron recently, and I truly feel it is from the alcohol abuse. 

Thanks for letting me vent.

It’s my first time stopping drinking but I have gone sober from drugs before and it was a success once my mind was set on it. I feel the same way now with being completely sober, I know it’s only been 4 days but I don’t feel I’m depriving myself from something, I feel like I have made the right choice and the intelligent choice for me. 
The thing is, I don’t know how to share my new goals with people around me. I understand I will have to build new relationships that doesn’t evolve around drinking and partying but I have this group of girl friends that are very dear to me and that have accepted me when I stop using cocaine and others. Now that I am going AF, I feel some of them are just not understanding why I would make a problem out of this and will be trying to get me to drink with them. I am going to hang out with them tonight and I am a little nervous I will have to defend my choice. I think for now I will just say I’m doing Dry February since I feel it’s more accepted. 
It feels so weird that people are uncomfortable with sober folks, it must be confronting for them. I know I will actually have way more energy and be a better gal without drinking. 
Stoping to use drug can be done somewhat in a discreet way but alcohol is everywhere and you have to be very public about it. 

How did you deal with this? People not understanding the drastic take on this. I feel when you say no, no people can be uncomfortable with the fact that you are an addict..? How to avoid this?",1

It's Friday, and man - after the week I've had (that's every week) - this is the night I want to stop and get some special Craft beers to ease into the weekend.

And then tomorrow too, you know, because...it's Saturday...or some other ""reason""...and why not? The excuses don't need to actually make sense or be tied to anything tangible.

Then Sunday - damn, work tomorrow, may as well relax today with a drink (LOL - ""singular"", I mean drinks). It will make Monday worse...and the night...but that's for future us to deal with, amirite?

This no way to live. 

**THIS IS NO WAY TO LIVE.**

Anyone want to commit to just not drink with me today? Let's start the weekend with a normal Friday that leads us into Saturday where we wake up feeling, maybe imperfect, but decidedly human.

On Saturday we'll deal with Saturday, but today the weekend starts - I'm not going to sabotage my Saturday and Sunday today. Let's give Saturday a chance.

Instead of trying to diet alongside quitting I decided I would stuff my face as much as I wanted (guess what? still loosing weight!). Instead of telling myself I will never drink again, I've told myself I will not drink for a month. Instead of dealing with the night-time anxiety and sleepless nights, I decided to self medicate (can go into a bit more detail, but not sure if allowed). And... it's all been going really well to be honest.

I've been at this stage before many times; 6 days in. This time, though, I haven't constantly been thinking about drinking. I haven't had to do deal with the inner conflict that hits me around 7pm. I do seem to have some sort of evening depression: I feel pretty positive during the day then the evening hits and I feel pretty lonely, but even that is becoming less of an issue as the days go bye.

Today is the first day I've really had cravings. I exited about watching the LEC (league of legends thing) and the thought just popped into my head 'and half a bottle of vodka would make this such a great evening' right out of nowhere. It's definitely set my cravings off, but I feel in a far better mindset to deal with it now than pretty much any other 6 days mark.

I don't wanna jump the gun as I still have a longgg way to go, but I'm actually feeling pretty positive about not drinking for once. So guys, if you're trying to quit by doing the same thing over and over again, just try doing it a bit differently, even if it doesn't fit your ideal quitting scenario. IWNDWYT!",3

Years ago when I tried non alcoholic beer, I found it to be a poor substitute for real beer. Just like veggie-bacon is nothing like bacon.

I have the same advice for people who want to cut out something from their life. Do not substitute it with a poor copy of the original but switch to something completely different. You want to break a cycle and you won't do that by drinking something that constantly reminds you of what you want to avoid.

When I cut out alcohol completely, I found that I missed sipping on something. At first I tried low calorie soft-drinks (which was something I never drank before) and in winter time I started drinking whole pots of green tea. I became quite a fan of different teas.",0

If you do I hope you are hanging in there, but I quit drinking over 400 days ago and being at home became very easy to stay sober after awhile as I grew used to the sober lifestyle.  

I am currently deployed and in a port call, alcohol is absolutely everywhere, all the people I can choose to go out with were all drinking.  Bars and hookers constantly are in your face.   This is the time I was most fearful of in remaining sober.  People constantly handing you drinks because EVERYONE drinks.  Nothing malicous people just honestly forget.  Everywhere you go it's about alcohol no matter what you do to avoid it.

I went to a few bars tonight, hung out with the friends who were drinking and I held strong.  Had a cigar and a couple of sprites and now I am in a hotel bed sober still.  It's tough but hang it there my fellow military folks.

I knew deep down for years I had a big problem with alcohol. Until I crossed the line and admitted I was an alcoholic, I was going no where. On one side of the line, I could talk myself out of how bad the situation was, deny it to hell and back, justify it in increasingly creative ways, and continue to struggle. When I finally said it, ""I'm an alcoholic and I'm struggling,"" doors opened up. I went to the doctor, came clean to friends, family, and my doctors,  and went to meetings. I started therapy. I realized that shame, fear, and guilt were halting the recovery process. Crossing the line shed those feelings and healing began.

If you are on the other side of the line and you are afraid, don't be. It's not easy to address the problem head on, but it turns out it's a hell of lot easier than suffering every day with your physical and mental state.

I'd like to share my experiences eliminating alcohol consumption, reading Alcohol Explained, and attending an open bar community outreach event.

On a whim, I decided to attend a resident happy hour to engage local area residents and learn more about civic service opportunities in my neighborhood. Four weeks after my decision to eliminate weekday drinking, why not find some new hobbies to do after 5:00 PM. 

At happy hour I focused on remembering names and meeting new people rather than alcohol. When asked what I'd like to drink, I requested water and realized I made conscious choice for water and not wine or beer. Although I consider this a win--a successful moment--I can't help but wonder why now. What's different about this attempt to stop drinking compared to past fails? The answer could prevent relapse. 

A decision to re-calibrate one's dopamine/serotonin reward triggers from alcohol to alternate, healthier activities and behaviors isn't easy. I suggest reading, or in my case listening to, William Porter's book Alcohol Explained. After listening to the book 3-4 times, I would posit I have successfully empowered my subconscious with knowledge of how alcohol works and fully understand the ramifications of just one drink in a logical manner. 

In addition to that audiobook, I invested in an Apple Watch, downloaded some sleep apps, and created a sleep journal. Rather than drink the night away, I'm challenged to improve my sleep hygiene stats, an easy way to maintain consistency. Sleep quality and quantity is often ignored when it comes to r/stopdrinking. 

Another helpful area to refocus your gains on is nutrition and wellness. There are foods that improve sleep, reduce stress and inflammation, and replenish vitamins and minerals that alcohol has stopped your body from absorbing.

On that note, I afford myself a cheat day once a week, Saturday or Sunday. It's only been four weeks, but so far, those three cheat days really screw with my sleep analytics.

This is totally my own thing; I'm not trying to preach or anything, rather just share how I feel. 

From the age of about 17 to 19 I used cocaine a lot. Looking back, I was totally addicted. Memories of crawling around on my hands and knees trying to find little grains of the white stuff that may have fallen on the floor after the nightly supply had run out are definitely not happy ones. When I stopped, I just stopped. Didn't think about rehab or any support groups. I just stopped. There were maybe 2 or 3 months during which especially the weekends were difficult. They didn't feel 'enough' because the drug was missing. Then it was fine, and I never really thought of it again. It was just something I did during a certain period, and now didn't do any more. 

While part of my identity while I was using was the fact that I was using, when I quit, the fact that I was not using was not part of my identity. I never thought of myself as an ex-cokehead. I was just me.   


For all the years I drank, drinking *was* my identity, and now I've stopped I feel not-drinking could become an identity. I don't particularly want that. I don't want to be dominated by daily thinking about this sort of thing. I don't want to find myself still, in some way, being dominated by the thing I've let go of. 

Like the cocaine use, or the toxic relationship, drinking is gone. It's something I did during a specific period and now I don't. The end. 

I couldn't tell you the last date I took drugs. It holds no significance. I don't want to spend the rest of my life counting days and needing to find something in that number or anything like that.   


I've nothing against groups like this -- I've got a lot of love for the people in this and other communities -- just as I've nothing against somebody who chooses to drink. Guess we've all got to find what works for us, and this feels right for me.

I am almost positive it started the day I quit drinking.  Or maybe the day my dad died, because in my mind he was healthy,  but he was actually not... Or maybe the day I gave birth,  because I am taking care of a little human, and I wanna be a good example. Anyway, the further on the journey I go, the more I learn and it seems, the better I take care of myself.   
I mean, it hasn't been a 180.  I have felt weeks of depression and gotten sick and then been so frustrated and given up.  And then sort of wake up with a glimmer of hope.  I am just slowly sprinkling in a little more ""health"" on my life.

I am getting closer to understanding the meaning of the word ""wellbeing"" than ever before. 

And finding there is no one way.  Walking,  meditation,  no Facebook,  magic foods and diets, special gyms or long hot baths... I am trying to decide what it means for me.  

I've recently been pouring over diet health theory and have drastically reduced my sugar binges.  They were getting really wild.  And at the time, I was ok with that, because it's better than drinking.   I am questioning whether I drank for the sugar now... honestly.   Sugar is super addictive too.  In my first ""low"" sugar week, I have definitely struggled in times of cravings and caved and had treats here and there. 
I want to recommend ""Sugar: The Bitter Truth "" (available on YouTube) because the Dr likens Alcohol to Fructose.   It seems our bodies metabolize both molecules the same way... almost.  

So, wherever you are in your journey,  I support you.   I hope you are climbing up and feeling proud today.  Here is a list I'd like to offer, of things that are helpful to me:

Not getting in a car.  Walking or riding a bike or running 

Sitting quietly in a comfy chair and looking out the window 

Nature. Touching the earth on the forest floor

Talking with family, Openness 

Being creative and writing music and singing 

Being playful with myself and others and doing silly voices and being vulnerable 

Little mini workouts that are only ten minutes or so in my regular clothes 

Vitamin D!!!

Chewing my food extra

Roasted veggies and rice (lots of whole foods and cooking and learning new recipes)

full fat milk latte (coffee or tea or chaga) and a little 20g 85% cacao chocolate bar

Fresh rolls and butter 

Love, cuddling and kisses 

Adventure and learning and challenges 

Giving myself a break

So much of my daily life at the moment revolves around improving my long-term situation and I'm not in the mood for productive activities tonight.   

I've already taken my dog for a long walk in the rain, made dinner for the family and ate with them, listened to an audiobook and I just feel bored out of my fucking mind.   

I want my usual routine of drinking half a bottle of vodka, eating mcdonalds or equivalently trashy food and watching something on Netflix half-conscious until I fall asleep.

Three weeks ago my 15 year old cat jumped the fence into the back yard where our other two dogs were (we think she may have had dementia).  Needless to say, she didn't make it.

So we also rehomed our beautiful new kitten so the same thing didn't happen to him.

On Monday, my two dogs got into a fight.  In separating them (yes, I know you're NOT to do that but I was home alone and had no other options) I sustained minor but painful injuries.

On learning evidence that it was the same dog that bit me was the one that killed my cat we made the heartbreaking call to have him put to sleep before he hurt anything or anyone else.

Of five dearly loved pets, we have lost four in under two months.

I've been sober nearly four months.

My heart has been ripped out, stomped on and set on fire, but I maintain that that particular grief is still in a way easier to handle than the guilt / anxiety / doom that comes with the morning after drinking.

This grief is pure, and I don't have my drinking to blame for any of it and for that I am glad.  It will help me to heal, staying sober.

But damn it was hard at times.",23

What a difference it has made so far! I am much fitter and healthier. I have a memory, more money in my pocket but most of all a strong urge to succeed rather than just exist waiting for the next opportunity to have a few drinks.

If you are in doubt whether you can do it or whether it is worth it just give it a go.

While I continue to remain strong I have no doubt I will not be going back to the dredded drink.

Stayed sober but it’s not easy. 

Had to bring a loved one to the ER knowing it would be a 5150. I didn’t see a choice.  She was breaking. Well, she broke. 

I’ve never done this before.  She’s 24hrs into a 72hr hold. What happens at hour 73?  She’s still going to be clinically paranoid. She won’t suddenly realize the importance of food.  She’s an adult. Can she just excuse herself?

How the hell does this work?  I have absolutely no idea. None. And I have two days to figure it out. 

And I need to do this sober. There would literally be no other way. And my husband is out of town. This community is why I’ll figure it out. Whatever it is...it’s not at the bottom of a bottle. 

Thank you SD.",7

I'm currently 26 and man I just am so ready to get off this awful ride. I received a Public Intox when I was 21 and a severe DUI at 23 that has caused me to lose out on several valuable opportunities. I've lost jobs over my drinking, ruined and certainly tested relationships with those closest to me, and most recently I lost my fiancée to alcohol. We were putting down a fifth every night for two years straight before one day I woke up from a stupor and all her stuff, the dog, was just... gone. She fled back across the entire country after we had a miscarriage from (you guessed it) alcohol. I've tried AA several times and it wasn't for me. I'm not religious but Celebrate Recovery gave me more peace of mind for a quick minute as their take on alcoholism was a little more my thing. But I've gone back to drinking often entire bottles of vodka every night, as in I can't sleep without it. And if I don't drink, I get mad crazy shakes, anxiety, depression sets in, the whole nine yards. If I'm being truly honest with myself, I feel as though I look like I've aged seven+ years over the past three years alone.

&#x200B;

When my fiancé left me, I attempted to stop cold turkey. I flew myself out to my aunt's house (suuuuper religious nondrinker) across the country for a week and it was absolutely horrible on my body. I'm one of the 5% who experienced D.T.'s. Highly intense, A Clockwork Orange-like blasts of relentlessly fast, flashing hallucinations, uncontrollable tremors, sweating. So cold turkeys not going to fly because it made me feel like my life was flashing before my eyes... if my life were a billion random images that made no sense.

&#x200B;

I spent last month on my back from throwing up so often that the ER set me up with getting an Endoscopy, and I've finally had enough. There's a cyst in my liver from a CT scan. If this is the start of consequential health issues from alcohol, at 26, I've got to find a way out of this hole. In-patient rehab isn't an option because being away from work blew out my emergency fund (my rent is $1,400 alone) and while my DUI's court-ordered drug testing DID help because it slowed me down and I could only drink on weekends, I feel like I need to taper off before I can stop completely... especially after the DT's. I just discovered HAMS... has anyone ever had any luck with it? Thank you so much in advance for any advice/help/feedback.",2

Long story short, not being under the haze of the booze I could weigh the pros and cons and ultimately took the position that was what I know more about. I haven’t been in that side of the industry for probably 6 years. Felt good to be decisive despite my apprehension. It’s a remote location far away from my treatment plan and my daughter. The hitch isn’t too long and the days off are regular so I can plan. The third job was decent but I think I need to put some distance between me and my comfort zone. 

I know how prevalent drinking can be in places like this but I have a plan to combat any situations that could tempt me. I will be away and essentially on my own so the only person to keep me honest is me. And let me tell you that no matter how much stress, frustration or isolation I feel I’m going to take it one day at a time. I’m strong and confident and I can do this. The time away will help on many levels so I’m optimistic. 

And there is wifi there so you can’t get rid of me that easy 😎

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I keep thinking that my husband/life stressors/literally ANY outside force has been the reason I drink, and yet, on this fourth night, it’s the first sober night I’ve had alone because my husband is at work. And you know what?

It is agonizing how bad I want a drink right now. 

I’ve had no problem abstaining while in the company of my husband. I think I drink because I can’t stand being alone with my own thoughts. Which is really sad. But eye opening in a way. I need to stop looking at every other possible reason for my drinking and really accept the responsibility that I do this to myself because I don’t like myself. Looking back I see the pattern. I drink in excess when I’m alone. But why do I do that? What happened that made me hate myself so much that I can’t bare to be alone with myself? Did I even do anything? Did I just wake up one day and hate myself? Why am I not kinder to myself? Why can’t I enjoy my own company anymore? Why can’t I enjoy. 

It’s day four and I’m having an existential crisis.

Obviously these were all rhetorical questions and I don’t expect a response. I think I just needed to type out my thoughts. I needed to do this for myself. I need to get to know myself again like I let others know me. If that even makes sense.

Got the checked in, started the paperwork. Statements like we will randomly count your pills, promise not to sell pills, take a UA every time you are in. And all the suboxone pamphlets on the side table next to me got me thinking “Oh hell no this is not the place for a boozer like me”. Almost bailed out again. 

But after pissing in a cup, blowing 0.00 and a blood pressure test finally got to talk with a doctor. Glad I stuck around because to finally be able to be 100% honest with someone about how much and how long my drinking has actually been going on felt so fucking great. 

Got put on neltrexone and a mild antidepressant. Also starting counseling, got recommended AA and some books to read. This is the most positive I have felt about quitting since I realized I had a problem (which has been almost 10 years now).

I’m stressed. Like really high levels of stress. 

I’ve been sober almost five months.,some days as a single parent are really Fucking hard and I’m resentful. 

I’m overworked and spread really thin.  My therapist had to cancel on me this week and my daughter and I had the flu so I haven’t been to yoga in two weeks.

I prefer not to go to meetings or work the program but therapy and yoga are the things that keep me sane. I can feel myself losing all of my chill. And I really don’t have anyone to turn to.

All of my friends are still drinking heavily and I’m just lonely and need some support. I’m not worried I’m going to drink but I think I’ve outgrown my social circle, it’s all really isolating.

She talks about sneaking alcoholic drinks into her kid’s school functions and the final party where she was so drunk she doesn’t know who put the kids to bed. 

As a single male with no kids, I can’t relate to this specific examples. But I did grow up listening to her music and watching her old show with Nick Lachey on MTV. Not saying I was a fan or anything but I do vaguely remember those memories from childhood. 

Just got me thinking about how you never know who is struggling and it was to hear she sobered up after going through everything she dealt with.

I feel like it negates so much of our hard work and successes.","I just want to be truly, deeply honest. I feel like this mentality fucks with my head so much. 

I wrote this because I fucking drank again yesterday and the three days before that. Not too much. Only 1-2 drinks each night for four nights - 4 drinks was the max on the 3rd night. 

Still felt a bit crap and tired all day yesterday. Felt great again today. Didn’t drink tonight. Won’t drink tomorrow. But I am having feelings that I am rubbish at this sobriety business. 

I am getting really sick of counting days and feeling like it’s all a failure when one bit of booze passes my lips. Overall there’s been such a drastic reduction in what I drink, compared to this time last year or even 6 months ago (at least a bottle of white wine every night down to generally nothing). 

I don’t enjoy drinking how I used to because of all the knowledge I have gained through trying to be sober, and am way more mindful and on the path to eventually being sober but it’s an entanglement of some 20 plus years (started drinking socially aged around 15) to get out of and I think I have to take it at my own pace. It’s like learning somethjng new, you don’t master it instantly and no one says you have to start waaay back at the beginning of the book for beginners again when you get it wrong. 

Sorry if this post comes across as negative, It is not meant that way. Just wanted to be truly real. Does any of this resonate? I have read so many quit books that I feel like I could probably give a pretty good spontaneous presentation 🤣

I want to fully recommend ‘Quit Like A Woman’ for nothing men/woman and any other gender identities by Holly Whittaker which I finished today, it’s very interesting and I liked the fact that it speaks about control of your own recovery and working out what is right for you.

I’m afraid to go out to places where I will be really tempted to drink. Because I know I’ll be feeling all kinds of self-loathing for getting myself in a position where I can’t go out and do stuff like everyone else can.

I hadn't had coffee all day.

It's my first day in YEARS without coffee, cigarettes or booze, I felt no more groggy than I do other days with coffee, maybe it's all that ""first few weeks booze free head"" you guys keep talking about. Maybe someday I just won't crave alcohol either but there's something weird about realizing that that thing you convinced yourself you absolutely need can just slip your mind if you're busy on other productive, important things.

My staff knows I have given up drinking but we were with clients who have experienced the full force of my history as a bon viveur (only-just functioning drunk) and wine aficionado (drunk with expensive taste/expense account). 

I shared that “I wasn’t drinking at the moment” and they pushed me to join in and I shot them down, explaining they were wasting precious dinner and drinking time with their efforts to get me to join in as it was never happening. They backed down but then asked me to choose the wine for them! Not sure what to say so I did. Spoke to the sommelier, chose a really good bottle, watched them taste it and then have 2-3 more bottles while I enjoyed my dinner accompanied by a bottle of fizzy water. 

Weird thing was that I never craved it through the process. No interest in it........it actually felt like I was participating in an experiment, objectively looking at people get enjoyment out of something that has caused me so much harm. 

I know it wont be always the case and I know that there will be a time where the same situation is going to cause me to get those gut busting cravings that we all know. Just happy isn’t wasn’t the case here.",146

He said just look at what happened to Rush Limbaugh. Took a lung x-ray even though I am not even coughing, and said he saw no signs of lung cancer but I have ""dirty"" lungs. I've also had pneumonia umpteen times and he knows it. He said he wants more (fasting) bloodwork and will check on me in 2 months.

I even asked if being alcohol free and changing my diet and exercise that goes along with that could change those results and I got a noncommittal that it might.

Starting to feel myself again - starting to put things in order again.

Having been giving some thought to my regular pattern of alcohol abuse.

For the past few years I have been AF for months at a time- these tend to be punctuated by periods of unsuccessful moderation resulting in excess or single lapses.

In each case though, I know I haven’t viewed picking up the first glass as choosing inebriation over my duties to family, career, self etc.

I know I have viewed it as nothing more than a sneaky treat. This allows me to view the drunkenness and disgrace that follows as something that merely happens to me (rather than being a consequence of my own actions).

I have felt genuine surprise at the shocking results- this was certainly the case this week, as stupid as that sounds.

I am trying to make a proper go of being AF. To do so I realise I must consciously characterise the first drink as a binary choice:

1. I can choose drunkenness, disgrace and all that follows (even if it is not that specific occasion but down the track); or

2. I can choose my duties to my wife and child, career, self, comfort, security and stability and so forth.

I have been too easy on myself as far as this issue is concerned and this has allowed me to escape accountability.

The first drink is the one to focus on- it is the critical link in the chain of drinks that may follow.

The purpose of this post is to put these thoughts in order- I know from past experience that we can alter our thinking deliberately.",8

By 5:00pm I would throw those goals out the window and pick up a bottle of wine on my way home. So much guilt and shame. I knew something had to change.

I tried quitting last January and made it only 11 days. 

I wrote about those days in a personal journal and read it exactly a year later. I realized I was in the exact same spot. Nothing had changed. I still had a desire to quit and had done *nothing* about it.

I have energy. My mind isn't cloudy. I have motivation.

Alcohol disrupts the chemical balance in your brain. It makes daily activities harder to get through, as your normal levels are very low to combat the extreme high levels caused by the alcohol. The day after a binge I always have to game and binge eat (get fat and lazy) as that's the only way to not feel super depressed. The depression gets to be too much, and I drink a bit to take off the edge. Rinse, repeat. Nothing gets done, and I gain weight. I lose money (I had 100k saved in the bank from my last time being sober, now it's all gone).

Not drinking allows your brain to go back to normal.

I've been struggling for a long time with motivation at work, but suddenly today I'm hyper motivated and excited about my work. My productivity is amazing (although I'm taking a break to write this). 

When I'm on a bender, I always look for other excuses about why things aren't working. I'm not at the right job. The people I work with suck. I'm looking in the wrong places for love. Etc. 

But it's always been the alcohol.

I'm not saying that not drinking has suddenly solved my career or love issues (both which suck), but now I'm motivated and have the energy and clarity of mind to tackle those issues. 

I pray for the strength to stay sober and live a fulfilling life like this! I know that I slipped up last time, but this time it has to stick!",24

I had to do it today knowing it was two years, but still, the idea of 730 days blows me away still.

I used to join this sub when I knew I needed to stop drinking, then drop it when I started drinking again and would become discouraged or embarrassed. I bet I'm not the only one, but to anyone who may read this and is struggling, or drops this sub when they slip - keep reading here, keep using others gains as well as their missteps to learn from and realize that not everyone gets it on the first try, some take YEARS before it connects. You'll find a lot of people here who may have very different backgrounds and habits but you'll find a lot of people that seem like they are writing about you, and those are the ones that really affected me. Those are the ones that stick with you and make you realize that while your struggles may seem that they belong only to you, that no, there are others, hundreds, thousands, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS, even that may relate better than you expected.

He's one and done as far as drinking goes. Lucky him. We each had Jameson’s Rocks and sat and talked for a while. I left and went to the store and picked up a small flask-sized bottle for myself for later. After I finished that, I had a half bottle of red wine. When I went to bed that night, he could really smell it. The next morning I got a text from him with a NYT article “What Does It Mean To Have A Serious Drinking Problem?"". I read it and that’s how I discovered Reddit/r/stopdrinking. Of course, I was hung over as usual, and of course knew I was in trouble (but no lecture thank god). I told him that I would not drink at the SB party and I didn’t. There are plenty of non drinkers to sit and talk with here, thank goodness. There are also lots of very high functioning friends who drink mass quantities of alcohol. The following day, he still hadn’t said anything to me and I told him I was going to be taking one day at a time. So that’s what I’m doing.

I’m surprised to find out how polluted my body and brain must be and how really tired and foggy I still am. By reading the posts here I’ve learned how toxic alcohol is, like the hangover is lasting for days. I’ll write more later, but I am NOT drinking today!",7

I did get this far a few years ago, but I'm actually \*trying\* this time.

By trying, I mean I'm going to AA and taking care of myself, one day at a time.  I had a sponsor, but that fizzled out. I'm looking for another one, but not too hard.  I'm trying to do 'the next right thing,' and 'keep it simple,' and all that jazz.  Most importantly, I am not drinking!

But the last few days (weeks?) have been weird.  

I'm not as happy as everyone seems to be.  I haven't lost all the weight others have 'just by not drinking.'  In fact, I've gained weight despite my attempt to exercise more.  My skin isn't 'glowing,' even though I have had more water in a month than I probably did all last Fall.   My face isn't less puffy (from what I can tell).  And honestly, I'm not as 'peaceful' as people say they are at this point.  In fact, I find myself wanting to poke people and say, ""Hey - it's not all sunshine and unicorns.""  

But I don't.  And I guess that's a sign of growth.

Lately, I just feel like I'm in a haze.  Although I have had some very close calls, I don't have a constant craving to drink, but I don't feel like doing much else, either.  As in, I just feel 'blah.'  My brain fights with itself every. Frickin. Day.  Which usually ends in a standstill and nothing gets done that I want.

I find myself wondering if my pink cloud has burst, or if this was who I was before I drank (which would be \*why\* I drank in the first place!).

Don't get me wrong, though! There have been positives in the past couple of months - and for those I should be grateful - or maybe more than I am.  This is quite possibly what is driving me to write this...

I am sleeping (sometimes too much)  through the night without sweats; I can write legibly now that I am not shaking like a paint blender; I can keep up with my toddler nieces; hold a conversation without worrying that they can see my glassy eyes or smell my terrible breath (nevermind feel how hot it is!);  and I'm sure there are other things, but this is getting long and I tend to ramble.

To summarize (lol!), the logical part of me keeps telling myself it does get better.  It just has to be louder than the alcoholic part of me that says, ""meh... why bother?"" 

So, for anyone who took the time to read this - and got this far, thank you.  There was no real flow to this post. I think I just needed to get this out of my brain - and somewhere other than in my journal.  I just have to get through today, right?

Salud!

6 months ago to the day I tried to kill myself. I am bipolar with PTSD and after a night of drinking I had a flashback and downed a bottle of pills. I was in the psych hospital over a week. Doctors kept telling me I had a drinking problem but I refused to believe it and I didn't want to change. I loved being drunk. I loved being the life of the party. I loved being able to mask my feelings, i loved staying out to 3am everynight at bars. I loved going on boozey lunches at work and not going back for hours (i dont know how I didn't get fired). In the hospital I met a man who was 22 years sober, we talked and he was the one to really convince me to get sober. I related so much to everything he said. Maybe i didn't need a drink every morning, but I'd have a couple while cleaning. I'd go out every single night after work and stay out late.

6 months later and I am doing it. My mind is more clear, I can handle my emotions better, I have been motivated at work. I do still miss my social life to an extent, and there are times (weddings, holiday parties etc) that are hard as absolute hell but I don't want to be that girl anymore.

I will be sober for about a month and then I slip up but I am way better than I was a year ago (drinking 1.5 bottles of wine a night compared to 1-3 every once in awhile). My biggest issue is my spouse. He has a no tolerance and has told me I can never drink again which makes it very difficult for when I have a slip up. I end up lying and I’m a terrible liar so then he eventually finds out and then explosively loses his shit with me.  Which he has every right to do - I shouldn’t be drinking at all as it is a slippery slope - but he is making it extremely difficult for me to be honest and up front with him. It may sound strange but it is almost a control thing for me - he is telling me what to do so I run in the opposite direction. I started drinking heavily due to a variety of problems - lost a business, financial issues, etc - but one of them was because I felt ignored and unloved and completely overwhelmed with all of our problems and did not feel like he was being supportive.  So we had relationship issues before I started drinking heavily and I realize I was using alcohol as a crutch. I have been really working on myself this past year and getting the help and support I need. Except from my husband. He has attacked my character, told me I’m a pathological liar, told me that I have shown him my true self and that he cannot be with someone like me. His anger is explosive and scary. And I have told him that it makes it difficult to communicate with him and be honest because I’m scared of his reactions. I’m at a complete loss. We have one child together and I have two from a previous marriage. I feel like I have completely ruined my life by the relationship choices I have made and now I am ruining my family.  I know I am a piece of shit for lying so much to him. I don’t know if we can recover from this. Has anyone been able to regain their spouse’s trust after breaking it so many times?",7

I started showing up to work drunk, drinking stale drinks, doing anything I could to get my hands on alcohol. 

I got the cops called on me twice this past month because I felt suicidal due to the excessive drinking. I blew a .35 both times at the hospital. I finally decided to see a doctor. I got a shot that will help me curb my appetite for alcohol. This was 4 days ago. I can now look at alcohol and just look the other way. I am also on anxiety medicine, and figuring out the root to my mental issues. This shot has been a blessing in disguise. It’s called Naltrexone. I’m starting to go to AA meetings. 

Guys, I never knew what sober life was. Please get help. Not for anyone but yourself. It’s so fucking worth it. Be around true people who care about you and won’t enable you. Go see your damn doctor. Your life is too precious. There are other ways around going to in patient or out patient. Always explore all options.

2020-02-06 13:58:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezx0rm/awkward_af/,Awkward AF,"So I had a 2 day work event. And had to present from the main stage. And do a workshop.  All sober. Not that I would usually be hammered while working. But certainly I would participate in the evening drinking activities.  

It went mostly well. I presented well. Received lots of compliments.  Made it through dinner and last calls sober. NA Beer was my friend. 

Next morning my workshop bombed and my whole day went emotionally south. The turmoil. I couldn’t think straight for hours. I finally got it together but barely.   Self doubt. Anger. Mental flagellation.  Sadness. 

Finally it all ended. And while we were all saying goodbye I realized as I often do that no one really says goodbye to me.   This event but kinda never. Always. 

I thought about it the whole way home and cried when I walked in the door. 

I reflected on the day and asked my husband why no one likes me. Really likes me.   And he told me that I am hella socially awkward.   All the time. 

 I knew this, of course, but the drinking for 3/4 of my life masked my ability to see or feel my awkwardness.  I am sure at one point the drinking was a social defense that over time became just who I was.  

I may have been awkward but at least I felt good and didn’t  give a shit.  

But now sober, naked and smarting - my awareness of my awkwardness has slapped me in my own face. So hard. 

And worse - now I am 46 years old and I never learned the skill of how not to be awkward.  I never learned to compensate around it.  I just hid it from myself.  And that makes me feel so sad.  The arrested emotional development that I self induced is just making me so damn sad. 

I am an introvert by nature I have always had to press myself forward socially with great and exhausting effort.   I may even be in spectrum based on  my observations these 2 days. 

So sad.  That is all.

Copy pasted from their website:

Naltrexone is at the heart of the Sinclair Method (TSM) for Alcoholism.   When you take Naltrexone prior to drinking, it blocks endorphins, the naturally occurring opiates in the brain, from being released when alcohol is consumed.

When the endorphins are blocked, there is no “buzz” or rewarding experience, and the alcohol doesn’t make you feel the pleasure that drives you to drink excessively.",4

And I've found that having a non-alcohol drink in the evening to replace when I would have normally had a beer (or 5) is extremely helpful for squashing those cravings. They still hit hard around 4 pm and having a kombucha in a wine glass or a NA beer hits the spot for me and keeps me sober. Also, I am one of those weird people who genuinely really likes the taste of beer, so NA beer hits that craving.

But I worry that getting stuck in this ""ritual"" makes it hard to completely de-center alcohol in my life. I'm almost ""pretending"" to have a drink, and I oddly get some kind of placebo effect sense of relief and calm from it.

But staying sober is priority #1 in these early days, so maybe it's ok. What do you think?",7

Because of you all I am so proud of myself!  If it weren't for this sub, I don't think I would've had the courage to break the cycle I was stuck in.  All the success posts have motivated me and shown me that it can be done, and the struggle-posts show me that we are all human and make mistakes, but i its how we react to those mistakes that defines us.

I am 33 years old, and now over a full week without a drink... and it feels AMAZING.  I don't think I have felt this good about myself and my life since I was in High school.  I have lost a couple pounds, I wake up every morning refreshed, and I am much more focused on my work and my girl.

Two weeks ago I was in a spiral of buying a 750ml Friday, drinking till I passed out.  Waking up on Saturday hungover, so I'd just finished what was left of the 750 and usually go buy another until the cycle ended in shame.  

Eight days is the 2nd longest stretch I have gone without booze in the last decade, and the best part about this stretch is that I have rediscovered my love for reading.  I have finished two books, which is more than I read all last year (suprise, suprise... its hard to read when you're pounding vodka as soon as you get home from work). While looking for a new read on Tuesday, I decided that I should reward myself.  Instead of buying new books from the bookstore and cluttering up my small apartment, I treated myself to the Kindle Paperwhite and downloaded some new Stephen King to devour.

My journal entry at the end of my last relapse,"Here we go again, congrats. I just want to remind you what happens next time you think “I can’t handle the anxiety” “it’s been two days since I slept” and I need a drink consequences be damned. They’re small consequences anyway right? I can deal with a headache in the morning, a little nausea. I’m only going to drink tonight. JUST tonight so I can sleep, or breathe, or forget...please god just let me forget. But in the morning that pain you were running from hits even harder and you know what would help with that headache...a shot! Just one it’ll be fine. That felt good. You know what would make you so numb you think that you’re happy? A whole pint of vodka! And so it goes and I promise you - you will end up where I am today writing this. I don’t know how many days it’s been - probably about 20. In a row. A fifth of vodka a day. How do you feel right now?

This nausea is like nothing I have ever experienced in my life. It’s flowing through my whole body and throbbing up into my head that feels like it may explode. I’m hot and cold. I’m under the blankets shivering but I’m sweating through my sheets. My room is disgusting and full of food, wrappers, and trash and not at all comforting. As if someone had been locked in here without a means to get rid of this stuff. Maybe a sip of vodka will ease this sickness, it could be withdrawals right? Well I tried but I immediately threw up. I couldn’t make it to the trash can - there’s vomit all over the carpet floor. I’m too dizzy, shaky, and nauseous to clean it up right now. Put a towel over it. The pain in my stomach is incredibly intense. I’m vomiting even when I suck on ice chips - I made it to the garbage (rather, I moved it next to the bed). The waft of old vomit fills the room even with the window wide open in the middle of January. The vomit on the carpet was from two days ago now. This should go away soon. My throat is burning intensely - it’s on fire. I still think I would like a drink, but when I try my mouth makes me spit it out. My body is taking over for my mind and trying to save my fucking life because I sure as hell cant be trusted with it. I haven’t slept in 72 hours now - my neck and back are so stiff and sore and there is no comfortable position that exists on this earth. And this earth is now this room and my whole world is this bed. The sheets are sticky and wet, the pillows are hot and oily. 

Why did I do this to myself? Why did I drink? Was this the anxiety remedy I had hoped for? Is this helping you to sleep or forget? Even if it could - is ANYTHING worth THIS? Not even the physical pain and exhaustion but the emotional pain. The family downstairs you continue to let down. The nephew you adore but ignore so he doesn’t see you like this. But he still sees you. And he asks “Aunt Hersh122, you really do forget a lot of things don’t you?” And it breaks your heart. So break this cycle!! 1 is too many and 1000 is never enough. Don’t do this to yourself again. I promise you ONE sip gets you right here.",47

I've been in denial for a long time. I dont know I have rationalized my hidden vodka stashes throughout the house for this long. Of planning out exactly how much I'm going to drink before work in the morning, to get to that special warm feeling but not enough that anyone else will notice. Of having different stores I cycle through in my very small town, so they dont suspect anything. My husband is also an alcoholic, and I really have spent most of our marriage congratulating myself that I dont miss work as much as he does, or have crazy drunken episodes that he does, all the while being in complete denial about my own problem. It dawned on me a few weeks ago, and i googled the list of semi-local AA meetings, and just looked at the list and cried and cried. 

I have done many weird, embarrassing things while blacked out, off and on since Ive been a teenager. I have been much better about keeping myself from getting to that point - I'm 31 now - but a few weeks ago, my preteen daughter (who I have largely hidden my drinking from) witnessed a massive drunken fight between my husband and I AND saw me puke after. And then last night... I have no idea who put her to bed. Last thing I remember was playing a video game with her, next thing I know, I wake up in my own bed. She didnt say anything this morning. She deserves better than this, and all it takes is me choosing better.

Best friend whos on the journey with me stumbled last night and doesn't wanna talk about it.,"To preface, we decided to quit drinking together, as we have been best friends for most of our lives and partied our early/mid 20's away and then we settled into ""knowledgeable craft beer guys"" in our late 20's/early 30s (which was just a nice way of saying we drank 6+ high powered IPAs a night every night each) We decided to give it  up for good, replace beer with health, start going to the gym, eating better and just enjoying a healthier life overall.  


Well, as my flair shows, we are nearly 1 month into this, neither have slipped even once, we both enjoy a few NA beers together 1 night a week, old habits are hard to break, but not impossible. Well, yesterday he called me and told me he had a date that night, he said ""Idk man, I might end up drinking, you wouldn't be mad at me if I did would you?"" I spent the next easily 20 minutes using every analogy, sales tactic and convincing point I could conjure up. I mean I sold him the dream; ""*think of how far we've come! You're going to regret this tomorrow if you end up doing it and have to deal with the hangover and plus, think of the shadowing guilt associated with it. Be an impressive date: tell her simply I don't drink. Don't be afraid to show her you're not afraid to be who you are*."" I really tried everything. Through everything I said he just hummed in agreeance ""*mmhm... you're right man........* *I know, man....*"" then he tells me ""*but you never answered my question... Would you be mad at me?*""  


I told him of course I wouldn't be mad at him but I would be disheartened. I plead one last attempt telling him I have urges to drink too! I want to collapse and conform to what my mind tells me is a socially acceptable, hell, **expected** thing to do, but I push through the urges and become stronger and more resistant to them the more I make myself know I can't do it again, I simply can not do it. He sounded so defeated from my words on the phone. He just excused himself to go get ready and said he'd call me later that night. We have this thing where, no matter what is going on we pick up if the other is calling (unless we're at work) he pushed me to voicemail after 2 rings and texted me ""*I'll just hit you up tomorrow, man*"" with a sweating emoji. I didn't push him just told him to have fun and be safe.  


He called me at around 11pm that night drunk and was apologizing saying he made a stupid mistake and he hated himself for it, I talked him off the ledge and he went to bed. Come this morning I wanted to talk to him about it and he simply said ""*Forget it, I don't want to talk about it*"" but I kind of think we NEED to talk about it, am I wrong for thinking that? We're in this sobriety together and I think he needs to talk about this so it doesn't happen again. Am I being too much? Should I just let him sweep this under the rug and chalk it up as a mulligan? What should be my next move, in your opinion.

I cant drink today.","This is a rant that nobody needs to read. I've been depressed for so long and I haven't even told my friends why. But I'll tell you all why. Please excuse any errors, I was crying lol.

When I was 14 I walked into Spanish class and saw a girl and felt something I've never felt before. I was overweight and knew she didnt want me to talk to her so I just didnt. I was friends with a girl she was friends with so i was able to hangout with her a few times throughout those four years. We went to the movies, a play and a few walks around town, but I was always the awkward third wheel.

 One week after graduation she announced she was going to college but didnt say where. I decided I needed to tell her how I felt just in case I never saw her again. I wrote a paragraph and sent it, she just said she never realised and she always though I was nice. It was what I expected her to say, and I though that was going to be it. A few days later our mutual friend said she wanted to see my new apartment and she was with her friends , i was the first in our small class to get an apartment and I said sure.

The girl I liked was with her :). I thought she would have avoided me seeing how I was a obese kid who just admitted to liking her for 4 years, but she came anyways. We smoked and talked for multiple hours and it was amazing. I never talked about my feelings because I knew it was pointless at this point, I just wanted to be her friend. Before she went to college she came over to my apartment two more times for small parties I held. I only had the parties to see her though.

A year later I got a new apartment and she was on summer vacation. I messaged her a few times and she ended up coming over three more times with a group of her friends. Once we went to a hibachi restaurant and I paid for her and her three friends and we had a great time. That was the last time I saw her, three years ago. 

A year ago I knew she was graduating college soon so I decided it was time to try. My goal was never to actually get a date with her. I just wanted to get to the point where i could ask her confidently to go on a date, and if she said no then I would still feel like I accomplished my goal and I'd be proud of myself.

I started at 262 pounds. Within 6 months I was at 187 pounds and felt confident for the first time in my life. But a major complication happened, she started dating someone. I was happy that she was happy and tried to maintain my new weight for as long as possible. But eventually I had to admit that I was only maintaining myself in hope that they would break up, which was wrong of me to do. I gave up and in the past 6 months I went from 187 to 240. And now I feel hopeless.

I've been drinking everyday for awhile now. My pancreas failed once for non alchohol related reasons so I know if I start drinking more it will end badly. I dont know why I've cared about this girl for so long but I need to get past it somehow. 

I wont drink with you today. I will get back on the elliptical. I will get back to being healthy again. I was only under 200 for two months but I felt great. But i cant do this for anyone else but me. 

Have a great day everyone.

Edit: see announced it today. Their first year anniversary for dating was two days ago. She had other boyfriends for years at a time so I'd never imagine it would happen so soon. Trying to be happy for her, but I'm also concerned for a few reason.",11
2020-02-06 11:47:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezv116/no_longer_shaking_my_emotional_snow_globe_and/,No longer shaking my emotional snow globe and settling for the same old mess: my cleaner apartment as metaphor,"I've noticed my apartment is consistently much cleaner lately (since no booze). So has my daughter who I have part-time. She's repeatedly mentioned ""wow, it's actually clean in here!""  


  My routine the past years has been to get off my last nightshift, sleep a few hours, and then get day drunk while I do chores (laundry, dishes, vaccum). Would say ""You deserve it! Isn't house upkeep more fun getting hammered!""   


  But the thing is, I'd only actually be efficient and capable the first part of the day. Then almost invariably I'd start getting tipsy or blackout. Often feel like ""deep organizing"" and pull shit out to re-sort. Eventually end up making some greasy comfort food or nachos or whatever  


  Then wake up with a partially clean place with a sink full of dirty dishes, and nacho crumbs around my computer chair, and a hangover, and shit strewn about  


  Today I woke up and everything I accomplished yesterday is still accomplished. There's still some totes and miscellaneous items out, because I'm still in the progress of getting rid of some unnecessary baggage, and fine-tuning my ""bigger body"" (home). But I'm actually making TRUE progress on that, week to week, and it's adding up. And it's meaning my life feels less and less like a series of work and household chores and clutter  


  Rambling abit, but what I'm getting at is that my emotional/psychological life has been like that too. So long as I'm drinking, it's been impossible to make much true progress and development and growth. And the underlying trauma and insecurities that have been holding me back are never getting truly addressed. I've just been drunkenly shaking them all up and seeing/feeling them, and then waking up, hungover, with them all still there, just in a slightly different heap: nothing changed  


I've lied to myself and told myself that booze has been providing any real joy (it hasn't, experiences that can bring me joy whether I'm drinking or not have brought me joy)  


  I've lied to myself that it helps me sort out my emotional clutter and tangled knots, because I get hypomanic or cry or send loved ones rambling texts or messages .. or phone them and blather on (probably slurring and sounding kind of pathetic)  


  And so my emotional organization and maturity has constantly been in this process of ""Oh, I'm drinking and feeling really strongly I need to look into another career!""  or ""I'm drinking and I really wanna call that ex that I still care about and let her know I wanna remain close"" ..  


  and those emotions have felt super powerful, and it's felt like I'm actually accomplishing something because I feel them, or drunkenly take preliminary steps to create change in my life ( ""Wow! I wrote down some dates for a course information session that's now buried under stuff and I'm too hungover to follow up on!"")  


  But in the end I just leave my emotional interior, and social life, just as cluttered, and messy, and less infused with real meaning. The booze swirls up the emotions,  eventually numbs and blunts them, but leaves tangible issues unaddressed  


  It's taking months for my apartment to see the deepening results of consistent presence and true attention. And it's more reliably an enjoyable place to inhabit  


  My brain and ""soul"" and life  is starting to see results too (still have LOTS of issues and bad days and boredom where it's tempting to drink. Sometimes almost unbearably so)  


. But I'm actually capable of not just confronting hard truths, but consistently taking concrete, tangible steps to change my life. I'm not just shaking myself violently like one of those Christmas globes and then ending up with the same old components scattered about in the morning   


  If I untangle a knot or 2, the scrambled ball of my emotional self still has those knots untangled the next time I approach my soul-growth. And for the first time in years I actually have some cautious optimism I might reach a place of self-acceptance and contentment, with a higher ratio of joyful moments, to sadness and pain  


  I look back at all the hours and days I've wasted getting wasted, and it's no wonder not only my apartment, but my emotional life, was in frequent disarray, and not the most enjoyable place to be  


  Here's to hours of true presence and growth, sustainable .. slowly accruing deeper rewards than the debt-inducing false joy of booze could ever provide

20 years ago today I thought I was done for. Thought I would never find a decent job again, that my life was essentially over at the age of 40. I was deeply depressed and an emotional and spiritual wreck. 

I was not physically addicted to alcohol....yet. But I had started drugs and alcohol (and tobacco) at age 14, I drank every day, often alone, almost always to excess, and seemed to have little/no control over how that pattern worked. I finally recognized that I could not continue as I was, and reached out for help. One of the first people I called was an old dear friend of mine, who at the time had been sober for over 40 years. She told me to consider attending an AA meeting and to just listen, and not to worry about it when they talked about God. So I did that, and I found some people who were willing to help me. I was a total wreck and they just sat there and let me cry.

That friend is still with us. She has been sober for over 60 years (she is 94 years old). I still thank the universe every day for her help and her presence in my life, and for the help I got in AA.

I don't go to meetings any more. I stopped after about 8 years, when I started a dedicated meditation practice that included yearly week-long silent meditation retreats. I had a moment of clarity when I attended my first silent retreat in which I realized that *I am perfectly OK just the way I am.* That was a first for someone who had spent the first 48 years of his life thinking something was fundamentally wrong with him. I also recognize that I could go back to AA and I would find many of the same sorts of people who were there to help me when I needed it. It's a fantastic benevolent anarchy and you can find a home there, and you can find help there. What you do with it and what you make of it is entirely up to you. As Craig Ferguson likes to say: ""They're right at the front of the phone book.""

Today I am a veteran public school teacher. I work with amazing kids at an amazing school in an amazing program and I am beginning to plan my retirement. If you had told me 20 years ago today that I would be doing this I would have laughed in your face. It's the hardest job I've ever had and the most rewarding job I've ever had. It never would have happened to me if I had not come to that moment where I realized I needed help and asked for it.

You can do it too. 

Be well.",1556

I had my last drink January 5/6 of this year. I live in a small town with limited transportation and activities. I know that I'm very much a ""social drinker"" although I still struggle with moderation, which is part of why I quit. I pretty much used drinking as a social lubricant since college, thinking it would help my social skills and anxiety. I know now that this is not the case.

The problem Im currently facing is finding social activities to do that arent drinking related. I am slowly developing hobbies and skills to keep myself busy, but they are very isolating. The most social interaction I get is the gym, which is still limiting because its definitely not a place to socialize.

I need to find something else to fill my time, but until I save enough money to get mobile, I have to stay fairly isolated.I dont have much, if any desire to drink, but I miss meeting people, making friends, and seeing the friends I did have. Im thinking I just gotta deal with it for now until I can get around or have developed a stronger sense of discipline, but if anyone has any suggestions, I'm open to them.

Hope you all are doing great!

I managed to keep it contained to a certain extent. Maybe going heavy on a weekend night.

Slowly though alcohol started to creep into everyday life. When my partner said he was concerned rather than acknowledge it, I then took to hiding my drinking. For a while it worked, I ""got away"" with it most times, maybe 2-3 times I had a slip up and left a glass out but I brushed it off.

Then it became having to hide drinking a bottle of wine or 4 beers before even heading out because I knew people I was going with weren't big drinkers. Sometimes, I'd say I wasn't drinking that night and drink alcohol free beer but really I was going into the toilets to drink shorts I'd snuck into the place.

I've done so many shameful things, and I mean I'm ashamed of myself. I've thankfully not hurt anyone else but it was getting to the point where I ran the risk of loosing my partner. He was getting so fed up with my hiding drinking.

Yesterday, I don't know what happened. I woke up at absolute rock bottom. Maybe because I had a giant glass of wine hidden in our bedroom and I was afraid of him finding it I couldn't concentrate or sleep until I removed it. That was 5am. I was consumed by it till 5am. I don't know why, but I didn't drink it. I poured it down the sink.

I couldn't get the words out so I texted my partner. I cried all day, I made myself sick I cried so much. In some weird way there's such a sense of relief that they now know... But I'm only at the beginning of this journey on day 1.

I have a therapy appt later and I feel just as sick about having to tell my therapist as I did my partner. I feel right now I can't do it but I know I have to. I think having it out there means having to face the reality of why I drink in the first place and that there's a lot of work I have to do on myself. I feel I'm nothing without that alcohol that makes me confident, or makes my anxiety subside so I can actually do work.

And yet, I know it doesn't. I just have to rediscover myself. If anyone has any books to read or podcasts, or just advice in general on loving yourself again. That'd be great. I'm also dreading the cravings. How do you fight them?

2020-02-06 04:56:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezq7ky/im_few_weeks_in/,I´m few weeks in...,"...so maybe it’s time for my first post here. In my 30s, I decided to stop at the beginning of last December. After the blackout caused by drinking, I woke up at home without my IDs, wallet and phone. With no memories what the hell happened last night. And of course, it wasn´t first time. I have a few similar “adventures” in the past, the one case I ended beaten in blood at bar toilet (my friends keep saying it wasn’t my fault, maybe they are right, but I´m pretty sure I could manage that situation much better if sober). I always thought that I´m not alcoholic, because basically I had no need to drink. But my problem was that after a few beers (because it’s what you do with friend on weekend nights, right?), I completely lost it and didn’t care how it will end.  Now, I know, that I have huge alcohol problem.

My wakeup call that day was my girlfriend of few weeks. She came at my home at the morning as planned, but I wasn’t able to do anything because the epic hungover. She just left, and I thought that I will never see her again. She the angel, so she came back later with food to take care of me, and that was it. I knew, I don’t deserve her. Not in the state I was before I stopped drinking. I don´t want ever again to see that look she gave that day, when I saw how discussed, disappointed and worried she is at the same time. I realized, that lose someone (girlfriend, friend, family member, etc.) because of some stupid pointless thing as alcohol, is just not acceptable for me. Don’t get me wrong, I didn´t stop because she was mad at me. I quit because I was mad on myself for what I became because of alcohol. Never more.

It also made me look around me. My uncle, drank himself to dad. My dad’s drinking problem, which was solved thanks to my mother a few years back, because she is a fucking hero and didn´t left in time when most people would. My cousin (son of uncle mentioned above) with drinking problem at the point, when he has nothing and no one in his late 30s). Huge red flags and reasons to stop. Wish I noticed sooner.

I´m only few weeks in, but zero regrets. I always thought that, except few hangovers, I´m ok. But now I see how much better the life can be. Increased productivity at my job, resulting in more free time for myself. A lot of new activities that I found and like. I´m even preparing for my first Spartan race, which take place in June. 

And my friends? As anyone here, I was afraid that I will be excluded because of not drinking. But it is exactly the opposite. Looks like when I´m sober, I can be less pain in the ass to my close friends.

This sub helped me a lot to realize many things. Thank you very much and good luck with your efforts to stop drinking. It’s definitely worthy.",6

Tonight I came home and found him passed out, with a shot glass on the floor. He initially tried to lie to me until I found about 5 empty whiskey bottles he had hidden around the house, plus one full one and a chaser. 

I caught him about a year ago stockpiling like this and sneaking it the same way. I asked him to never drink whiskey again and to get counseling; he did. 

Tonight, he admitted he hasn't been sober in almost 5 days. He admitted he is an alcoholic and is inconsolable, crying and suicidal. I made him some tea and food, dumped the whiskey, and I am staying next to him so we can get through to morning together.

I am devastated, but I also know this isn't about me. He hates himself right now. I also know this could have ended so much worse, because he has driven in the last few days and I shudder to even go down that route in my mind.

At first I was furious and I am sure I have a lot more anger in my future, but tonight I decided forgiveness and grace is the best route.

HOWEVER, today's my birthday!  Eating out with friends!  Cheers all around.

My issue is truly my at-home drinking.  One bottle + nightly of chardonnay, for over twenty years.  Trying to moderate my at-home drinking was impossible.  BUT, when I go out, or visit friends, my self barometer works a treat.  I don't want to get stupidly drunk in front of them, so can easily limit myself to one or two.

Question. Is this a possible way forward for me?  I live in Tropical North Queensland in Australia.  Social drinking is defs a thing.  We only go out once in a while, maybe once or so a week.  I see this as a great compromise for me.  NO wine at home, ever.  ONLY drink when out with friends. 

Or am I rationalising this and using it as a crutch to continue drinking?",2

I'm new here. I've lurked for only 2 days. I found out about this sub from a recent article in the NYTimes. The author had a similar problem to me: I drink a little too much, but not crazy.

But sometimes I skip a day, but I might have 3 or 4 on a day, too. Those are the bad days as I don't feel good the next day. I'm attracted to this sub because it's description says it's a place for people who want to ""control or stop"" drinking. I just want to control it more. I don't ever want to have 4, and rarely have 3. I want to cut what I'm doing in half. I don't want to go totally dry at this point. (Maybe I'll change my mind, but this is where I'm at now... and I kinda feel like I'll be scared away if that's the only option... I doubt I'll ever go to AA unless I find myself getting much worse.) However, from my (very) limited lurking, it seems like most of the posts are not about limiting, but about stopping. Am I welcome here, or is there another sub I should seek? Thx.",3

“[Six Habits of Highly Grateful People](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/six_habits_of_highly_grateful_people)” has little to day about specific strategies. It’s about things we can do in our gratitude practice, rather than how to do our practice. If you have an existing practice, it’s a good check up and opportunity to consider. If you don’t have a practice, maybe this will get you thinking. Here’s the list:

Occasionally think about death and loss

* Take time to smell the roses
* Take good things as gifts, not rights
* Grateful for people, not things
* Be specific about what you are grateful for
* Process life through a grateful lens--transform obstacles into opportunities

So, sobernauts, do any of these practices seem like they would work for you? How, over the next week, will you try them out? I need to focus on people instead of things, and I need to be much more specific. I’ve added that note to my daily list, and will see what the reminder does for me.",24

What i really didnt expect is the immense torrent of raw emotion hitting like a tidal wave. I always drank to numb the mind and not feel. Now its like i have years of emotional dept to repay. Iv barely been able to function in this last week. Sleep evades me.

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I've been watching a lot of scary/thriller movies and they are a tremendous help to me which I know is weird. I think it has something to do with how anxious I am. The scary movies seem to give my anxiety a nice little target for a couple of hours, which is better than random anxiety just bouncing all over the place.  

 I tend to be a very productive person, so breaks (like watching movies) help me balance my life. It's proven to be critical for my mental and physical health. I hope you guys are giving yourselves some ""you time"" as well. I promise we've all earned it. Have a great Thursday and I will not drink with you today!",97

2020-02-05 18:05:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezicmj/thinking_about_stopping_with_alcohol_for_a_while/,Thinking about stopping with alcohol for a while,"Hi all,

The fact that I'm here writing is I think a first good attempt in stopping with alcohol or at least lower the volume. 

I personally never thought I had an issue, but in the last few years my consumption of alcohol has raised. Its been a long time ago that I had a day where I didn't drink anything. I think its at least 1 year ago. Perhaps already 2 or 3 years. On an average day I drink about 1 liter of strong beer (11,6%). In addition to that I have 2-3 days a week where I also consume 2-3 glasses of vodka or whiskey. On these days, just before I go to sleep, I take a short walk with my dog and I notice that it takes a lot of effort not falling over on the ground. So for sure I go to bed drunk a lot.

Why did I think I had no issue? It rarely happens that I need to puke before going to bed, like once a month. Also it also almost never happens that I wake up with a hangover. Although, I wonder if I just got used to the feeling in the morning and I don't recognize the hangover anymore. Perhaps its there, but it feels like normal because it's always there.

From a social life point of view, I would say there is no issue, but it feels like ignoring the facts when I say this. Lets start with work: I work 40 hours a week as a freelance consultant. I exceed on many levels compared to others in the company. Ofcourse everything can be improved, but I don't see any downsides there because of the alcohol. I do see that the relationship with my wife could use a bit more energy, especially when its comes to intimacy. She also drinks a lot and its sometimes difficult to find some 'us time' where we are both sober. I personally don't enjoy intimacy when we're both wasted.

Now my wife, that used to drink about 2 bottles of wine a day, made the decision to stop with alcohol. I love her a lot and I like to support her in doing this. It made me wonder if it would be a good time to also put a hold on the alcohol consumption for a while. I'm almost there..... and how stupid it may sound, there is 1.5 liter left in my fridge and I promised myself (for now) to not refill my stock soon. This would mean that tomorrow I have one more day of regular 'abuse', then one day where I reduce it with 50% and then most likely, the hard days will follow.

By the way, English is not my main language, so sorry for any grammar mistakes!

But why this amount of alcohol in the first place? I've always used the excuse that I operate the best when I'm self-destructing myself a bit. I can be a person with a lot of energy. When I sleep a lot, consume less alcohol, my mind seems to go into some kind over overdrive. I suspect that I have something like ADD, ADHD or something close in the same spectrum. I noticed this on high school, I get the best results when I'm in a time-squeeze, when pressure is high, when expectations are beyond reasonable. At this moment I'm 44 and for the last (at least 25 years) I always balanced between just enough and just too little sleep. Just to prevent myself from getting in this overdrive because my mind and the amount of thoughts, things I want to do/investigate/etc is going crazy.

The reason I write this all is because I wonder if there are others that feel the same. If yes, how do you cope with this? 

I've read a lot about cravings here. Also my wife, who is sober now for 9 days after drinking with me for the last years, she really experiences these cravings now. I'm a bit afraid of those... it feels they will also hit me. Any tips for my soon to arrive cravings are welcome. My first goal is to be without alcohol for 1 month and see how it goes. If it all goes OK, I would like to go back to occasionally drinking, for example only 2 nights a week, like Friday and Saturday.

But lets see how it works out..... big plans here, hope I'll make it. Any support is welcome!

Thanks all for reading my story!",4

Last December I gave up drinking on the 31st after experiencing significant health concerns. I took a hard look at what I was doing to my body and how alcohol was negatively impacting my life and decided I'd had enough. I privately promised myself I wouldn't drink anymore, loaded up a sobriety counter app on my phone, stocked up on NA drinks and ""tied myself to the mast"" as it were.

I want to say to those who are struggling, it can be done. You will  be tempted, you can fail, you can get back up and try again. But it can be done. I think what worked for me was asking myself, ""Is this what I really want? Am I being real with myself?"" I had to make it a mantra.

Last week I survived two appreciation dinners for coworkers. I say survived because that's what it feels like: an ordeal. The first one was easy, it was a sit down dinner and some of the people there don't drink for religious reasons, or they are under age or whatever. But looking at my bosses order huge, sweating beers made me want to break. I closed my eyes and ordered a Thai iced tea instead. The second 'dinner' was in a huge bar where games are available: pool, corn hole, video games, ping pong, you name it. It was loud, catered, and the drinks were on the company dime. The manager handed me a drink ticket which I immediately handed back. Later I found out I needed it for ANY drink so I ended up ordering some mocktails and O'Doul's. This is where the discomfort really starts.

Everyone I work with, is younger than me, in their twenties. They're just starting out and of course, they haven't hit the point in their lives yet where they can question the social availability and consequence of alcohol. They've also seen me very, inappropriately drunk, much to my shame. One girl caught on to my not drinking and immediately started questioning me. 

""Why aren't you drinking?""

""Because I don't want to.""

""But why?""

""Because I don't want to.""

""But you used to drink so much more!""

""Yeah. And it was killing me, because I was drinking all the time.""

She stopped after that. I didn't think it should matter to people what I was drinking. On the plus side, people wanted to know about the NA brewing process, they wanted to smell my beer and made mostly positive comments. 

It was exhausting, but I was the only one who didn't have a hangover and waste half the next day recovering. That's the other thing about this, one of my biggest pet peeves is wasting time. I've reclaimed so much time being productive and **not** hungover I feel like I am getting my life back and rebuilding towards something good.

Thank you to this community that has allowed me to vent, seek resources, and put the pieces together. If you are new and struggling, just know the sober movement is growing and you can be a part of it. Find what works for you and you can do this.

2020-02-05 17:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezhk5b/conflicting_views/,Conflicting views,"Hi all- morning of day three after recent binge.

Have been periodically AF for probably the last two years- up to five or six months at a time.

Recent binge comes at the end of a month AF, before that circa five months AF.

Each time I have either completed a defined period, or gotten lax when the heat has cooled down.

Starting the process again now- I would like to be AF for good, doubling down on resources and strategies that have worked for me in the past.

One thing I have struggled with is this:

The literature and groups like this encourage you to view lapses as minor setbacks in a broad arc of improvement. 

I think this is how I conceive of it- I know the effort it takes to be successfully AF. I think others with disordered drinking see it the same.

However, people who have not experienced disordered drinking themselves (I am thinking of my wife here) only see the lapses in a long line, adding together.

To them, of course, it is impossible to see something that didn’t occur. I have a lot of sympathy for this view too- it would be unreasonable to expect praise for behaving like a normal person.

Together though, what this means is that there is little I can say to my wife to assure her that this new effort will lead to a different result. (Internally, I know that a promise to perfect, eternal AF is probably a sham, given flawed nature of human beings).

I emphasise in my mind the successful AF periods- she emphasises in her mind the lapses (which are admittedly shameful and serious).

Just wanted to share a non-traditional milestone measured in calories saved. I just passed 100k, and couldn’t be more thrilled! While I do spend time focusing on my days without drinking, calories saved has been an eye opening tally that reminds me of the overall costs my regular drinking had on my health.

My tracking tool estimates that I’m saving 5500 calories per week with no booze. This was a very conservative number for me at the time. Prior to my stop, I was drinking several a high avb six packs during the week and many more on the weekend. Those beers can have over 200 calories per beer, or 1200+ per six pack. Plus you have to add all that shit food your eating or overeating while drinking.

I’ve been sticking to an exercise and food regime for the past 100k calories too, and sobriety has made it so much easier. Making the right food choices and sticking to exercise was always more difficult when drinking or nursing a hangover.

Thanks for all of the support SD! I’m feeling better and the waistline has been shrinking as my calories saved number has gotten bigger. Keep on keeping on.

The type of person to look up sleep paralysis and decide that I have narcolepsy lol.  Also my overthinking causes slight paranoia.  I think people are looking at me and judging me but the I tell myself I wouldn’t have known they were looking if I wasn’t looking at them. Anyways I’m also an alcoholic and we all know it “ fixes “ anxious thoughts but overall makes them way worse. And so does the process of quitting.  

One of the biggest triggers in my life for my anxiety is relationships. I love to love...but breakups are like finding out someone died. I lose it. The world comes dark, I want to keep trying, I feel like a loser, I don’t know what I did wrong and I must be flawed. Staying home alone like normal people do on weekdays feels like I’m buried underground in a box. 

So to tie this all together, I’m decided I’m going to taper off of alcohol but I am also 2 days into a break up with the girl I’m in love with. She’s amazing but also and alcoholic and way worse so it caused a good thing to be horrible. I was wondering if the two biggest triggers are happening at the same time is a bad idea (maintaining sanity during a breakup and tapering alcohol). I read it’s bad to try to quit a bunch of addictions at once and she deff. Is one of my addictions. Should I wait to taper to make it easier when my head/hearts healed? Anyone experience something similar and have tips to maintain sanity during both? I am not quitting drinking because of the break up I’m doing it because my body and mind hurt to much and it’s time. Idk how to wrap my head around doing the hardest thing ever while experiencing the hardest break up ever. Say what you want but before recently the only thing I thought could ever make me able to quit is if she was sober and wanted me to. I wouldn’t even think twice . I could do it so easy for someone else but not for myself. I love to love but don’t love myself blah blah . I apologize for the rambling and I probably would be down to say this al to a therapist but I currently don’t have health insurance. I hope this post is ok",4

For the past few months, I've been working on quitting. I've had a couple relapses but overall I've drank less than I ever have in my entire life, which feels awesome. 

Here's the thing though -- I'm starting to take note of my ""triggers"" and I'm finding that socializing with pretty much anyone makes me want to drink. I'm an introvert, so I've always had a tendency to tire easily when I'm spending time with others. It's not that I don't like people! I'll just usually hang out with friends only once or twice a week and then happily spend the rest of the time by myself. I had this terrible realization the other day though -- I couldn't remember a single time in the past several years that I hung out with friends without alcohol involved. Even my best and closest friends -- we were always drinking. Meeting at bars, boozy brunches at each other's houses, etc etc etc. Now that I've decided to quit, I find that I don't have much trouble abstaining when I'm at home by myself, but ANY time I make plans with anyone this crazy anxiety starts to creep in and I just feel like I need to drink either before or while we hang out. 

I'm worried that I've associated friendship and connection with alcohol for so long that I don't know how to have fun with people without drinking. I've hung out with friends a dozen or so times sober in the past couple months, and I just can't seem to have that great of a time. Has anyone else experienced this?

Still, it's a demanding job, long hours, which i don't mind, I'm used to that, the thing that bothers me is having no one to talk to, being at work all day and not being able to connect with anyone at the end of the day, I guess I'll build new relationships in time, wether from my new job or just the flow of life, but every day, i get home, I'm exhausted, and i have to convince myself to sleep to go for a run in the morning instead of what i really want.

My social life has revolved around alcohol for the better part of 13 years. Lost friends, relationships, ambition. Gained a bad reputation, poor coping mechanisms, and put myself in harm's way hundreds of times. Honestly, I'm lucky to be alive.

I work with people with disabilities, it's a high stress job and my hours are all over the place. No way can I get to meetings everyday (I tell myself) I also question wtf im even doing there a lot of the time.

Completely broke down to my therapist this morning, she told me: you need to see a doctor immediately. Not a step I would have taken without her help. I dont have a family doctor, and have been putting off going to a walkin clinic to discuss alcoholism because um, that seems, so, weird? 

Doctor tells me yes, you are an alcoholic, lose the guilt, lose the shame, you have a disease. Do you smoke weed? Daily. He tells me straight up: you're not in recovery. Cut out the weed. I'd been really grappling with smoking weed while occasionally attending AA meetings. Needed to hear that from a doctor. 

Gives me a note for two weeks off work, go to meetings every day, get a sponsor, no weed.

I had ""earned"" that beer (or two). I HAD to take that vendor out for a drink (or three) to close the deal. Work hard / Play hard has been my mantra for decades. I was both under control and out of control at the same time. Sure on a Sunday I could polish off a 12 pack if I put my mind to it, but it was over 12 hours, so its really not a problem - I was ""pacing"" - and normally stopped at ""only"" eight.  I didn't drink every night, and when I drank at home (or was out to eat with the fam) I limited it to one or two (usually), at least during the week. Of course those two may or may not have been imperial stouts or double IPA's in a pint glass... but hey it was only ""a couple""

Then the liver enzymes came back elevated, then I started putting on the weight. Middle age hit me like a brick wall. Deep down I know this is not my best self.

Now that I have a new job I want a fresh start. I am drinking less (or so I tell myself) but on some level I want to do more.  I want to get healthy. I want to loose weight and give my liver a chance to heal. I told myself after the Superbowl I'd take the rest of the month off.

I've noticed a lot of posts recently about folks asking when they'll start feeling better. So to celebrate Day 1200, I've put together a timeline that illustrates my experience in recovery. We're all different...some of us may recover more quickly than others. For anyone who is interested in the science behind how alcohol works and what it does to our brain chemistry, I would highly recommend reading *Alcohol Explained* by William Porter. It's a very simple approach to a complicated topic. Here's a breakdown of my experience since my ""birthday"" on October 23, 2016:    
    
* **Day 1 to 4** - Hell. I was lucky enough to have meds to help me through the initial withdrawal period...but it was no picnic. Severe anxiety, depression, irritability, tremors, insomnia, nausea, etc. It was awful and I never want to experience that again.    
* **Day 5 to 8** - The tremors subsided along with the severe anxiety and depression. I still felt like my brain was hooked up to a car battery and someone was giving me periodic shocks. Loud noises made me jump. I went to my first AA meeting ever on Day 6. I was nervous as hell beforehand. Thankfully melted away as soon as I sat in the chair and realized I was surrounded by kind and supportive people who walked the same path.    
* **Day 9 to Day 20** - My mood was all over the place. The initial irritability was gone, but my anxiety was still high. The ""brain fog"" was setting in. I was having a hard time concentrating and thinking straight. I was still having a hard time sleeping.    
* **Day 21** - This was my ""pink cloud"" moment. My mood was through the roof. I had tons of energy...almost like I was manic. It felt good but I kept my guard up. I didn't want to get too cocky because I knew this is when some people drink to celebrate. Fuck that.    
* **Day 21 to Day 90ish** - This is where I experienced [anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia). After the pink cloud, my mood fell flat. I wasn't happy or sad. I just was. I wasn't getting any enjoyment out of life. Nothing interested me and my motivation was at an all-time low. I felt like a zombie and was definitely questioning my decision to quit alcohol.    
* **3 months - 6 months** - My anhedonia started to subside and I started to feel something very familiar and nostalgic. It reminded my childhood and I couldn't quite place it. Then it struck me: I was feeling *happy*. It had been so long since I had felt genuine happiness, I didn't even recognize it. The happiness would come in ""blips."" It wasn't constant, but it was relieved to finally be feeling it.    
* **6 months - 1 year** - The blips of happiness became more frequent and turned into waves. By this point I started seeing a therapist and started a regular meditation practice that was helping boost my mood and reduce my anxiety. While things were going relatively good, I did experience a bout of [PAWS](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/post-acute-withdrawal-syndrome). Just a few days before my 1 year milestone, the bottom dropped out on my mood and I became extremely anxious. This lasted several days, but I turned here for support and found out that many other folks had experienced the same thing around their 1 year mark as well. Thankfully, it passed quickly and I started feeling better.    
* **12 months to 16 months** - I was surprised to find that I experienced the biggest gains in my mood and overall sense of well being in the entire process at this point.    
* **17 months to 2 years** - I decided to start practicing yoga around my 2nd year sober anniversary. GAME CHANGER. After only a few yoga classes, I started to feel more inner peace and happiness than I had ever felt in my life. I was amazed at what an impact it had on my mental health. I now practice yoga at least 3 days a week...can't live without it. Gaining muscle and getting into shape is merely a side effect!    
* **2 years to present** - I feel better than ever. Don't get me wrong: I still have bad days. I still get anxious and depressed, but overall my mental health is better than it has ever been in my life.    
    
I hope this helps some of you who are still struggling. It takes many months for our brains to heal after years and years of alcohol abuse. It takes a lot of patience...but keep in mind that for every day you do not drink, you are taking one [baby step](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcpcZEenDXJ/) in the right direction. I cannot stress how important regular exercise has been for me. Recovery meetings like AA are also a great way prevent isolation and to boost endorphins and oxytocin through socializing (besides all the other obvious benefits) and authentically connecting with others.    
   
I have so much gratitude for this community. Thanks, SD!

I'm remembering my first cold in sobriety, and how confused I was as to what I could/couldn't or should/shouldn't take to help with the symptoms, so I figure it might be of some benefit to share my thoughts on cold relief for any newcomers. I'll also preface this whole thing by saying I'm not a doctor, so I won't be recommending any specific medications, but I will encourage everybody to consult their own doctor or pharmacist for any questions they may have in selecting the correct medications to take. 

Firstly, as we're getting into the heart of cold and flu season, I recommend getting whatever over the counter remedies you plan to use *before* you get sick. Reading labels and comparing ingredients is a lot easier with a clear head. And I can't stress enough how important it is to read labels; it may be tempting to grab two or three different medications, thinking they'll somehow combine into a magic potion to cure a cold, but in reality a lot of cold and flu medications contain similar drugs (Acetaminophen, for example) that can lead to an overdose. When in doubt, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help selecting the right drug(s).

When it comes to selecting medications, a lot of the liquids contain some form of alcohol, though many of the gel capsule versions do not. Similarly, ""Nighttime"" versions are more likely to contain alcohol than the ""Daytime"" equivalents. Taken as directed, medications containing alcohol can be beneficial, so it's up to each of us to be honest with ourselves as to whether or not we trust ourselves enough to take them as directed.

From my personal experience, I've taken liquid cold medicines both with and without alcohol in them without any triggers from the alcohol within them. That being said, I was surprised to find that the act of drinking the liquids *was* a trigger. Using the little measuring cup that comes with a lot of the versions was too similar to taking shots for me to feel comfortable, so I've since relied on gel capsules to avoid that trigger whenever I have a cold.

On a final note, I was very self-conscious about drawing attention to the fact that I wasn't drinking in my early sobriety, especially from a stranger (The pharmacist, for example.) I can honestly say I've never felt pressured to explain why I'm looking for an alcohol-free version of cold medicine. Enough people out there in the world wanted an alcohol-free version of cold medicine that drug manufacturers decided to mass market it. It's not a big issue. If you do want a 'cover story' of sorts to use, though, I'd recommend a variation on ""I need something for this cold, but I still have to drive to work/school/pick my kids up/etc, so I want to avoid anything with alcohol. Can you help me find the right option?""

Take care all!",4

2020-02-05 12:02:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ezcltm/day_two/,Day two,"Hi community,

This is my day two. I have been struggling with addiction for more than 13 years now. Using drugs has  always been part of my identity and something I was somehow proud of, proud of the marginality, of going against what was asked for me. 

I have been able to stop using hard drugs in the past, celebrating 633 days without chemicals today. When I managed to do that on my own, I was so proud and so empowered by my self-control that I felt like to stop using other drugs would be easy and would come by itself. Of course, that did not happen and now I have to admit that my use of alcohol and weed as just grown since. It has come to a point where I am avoiding contact with other people, isolating myself and suffering from anxiety, guilt, and having this constant feeling of being a failure. I have been settled on my goal of being sober for months now, but actually doing it, separating myself from my lifestyle and from that part of my identity seems so incredibly hard and nearly impossible to do. 

Today I know what I am working towards. I have set goals in the near future that will make my life better and will allow me to do what I love daily. Having this thing to look forward to has made all the difference in being able to say ""I have to start today if I want to get there"". I feel like I have been waisting my life and my gifts and I really want to be the better version of myself for me and for the people I love. I dont want to live with this contant guilt and this constant hatred of myself when I can have control over my actions. 

Yesterday was hard to get through and so will today. I have a though journey ahead, but having a community means everything and reading your stories makes me want to work hard to achieve this gratification too. 

Thank you for welcoming me,",7

(I’m so bored of thinking about alcohol!),"I post on here a lot and decided 2020 was the year to stop. I’m 41 in a few months time. I’m not a heavy drinker, but I’m an evening binge drinker and can sometimes go 7-10 days in a row drinking 6-8 beers plus wine every night. This might not sound a lot but it is and it effects my mental health.

My recent period of abstinence was nearly 3 weeks - then until Saturday arrived. Before drinking again, I was feeling great. My marriage better than it had been for years. I was losing weight, my anxiety was at a 1/10 instead of the 10/10 when I’ve been on the beer.

So, Saturday. We went to a family member’s 40th birthday party and I caved in and drank.

Everyone was drinking. Not one person was chilling with a coke or water. The voice told me “just drink on special occasions, you’ve got this.”

No. I spent Sunday incredibly hungover. Then I drank beers that evening when I got home, then I had more beer on Monday evening and last night as well!

Back to Day One. I keep doing this. I’ll have 60 days under my belt and BOOM “just drink Friday nights” happens and before I know it I’m drinking Saturdays AND Sundays too.

I never blackout. I never drink before 6pm. I never doing anything I regret whilst drunk. But I do wake up at 2am every single time I drink. I always argue with my wife over stupid stuff the next day. I get emotional and sensitive when I am drunk.

And I can’t just have one drink, or two. If I buy 6 beers I want ALL six and then I want a glass of wine.

I’m writing all of this so I can look back at this post if I get that urge to drink anytime soon.

I stopped drinking Jan 2019 when I got pregnant. I am now at 1 year with no alcohol. My SO who was also a heavy drinker stopped drinking Jan 2019 as well. He is feeling really motivated and intends to continue not drinking. I am inspired by his resolve and also like the way I feel not drinking so I am considering not starting again. 

I read Allen Carr’s Easy Way To Control Alcohol and I found it helpful. However, I still crave wine; mostly at parties or when spending time with friends who I would normally drink wine with. I can still enjoy these occasions without wine, but there is a nagging feeling that I would like to have some. I would rather not drink at all than to have the “occasional glass or 2” but I am still so tempted.

I’ve gotten so much better about not doing that but decided it’d be ok last night. Beers at home until they ran out, followed by a stroll to see my nemesis, the nearby dive bar, circa 12:30 am. I haven’t been there in over a month. They know me there and they’re nice, at least. They even had missed me a little. “Where have you been?” they asked. 

Kept on mashing the beer button until the wee hours thinking it was all ok. Made it home late and fuzzy but safe, ordered junk food, went to bed. And, honestly, in the moment it was fine and I was drunk, until I had to wake up this morning. Hurting. Showing up late to work, chugging coffee to fix my breath, anxiety bubbling away, brain feeling like a small child sitting on my forehead. 

This is why I don’t do this anymore. Nothing “bad” has to happen for drinking to be the wrong choice for me. I am thankful this is no longer a weekly occurrence for me, but am disappointed that it happened even this one time again.

Probably an indication right there that i need to address the issue. I've since then done 3 or 4 days of no drinking after weekend binges that left me so sick i couldn't even do schoolwork. 

I'm just worried if i try to do a moderation instead of kicking the habit ill fall back into the same whole of 1 to 2 then nights of 6 or 7.  

In my phone i made a pros and cons list of quitting

Pros:

* more money in the bank
* less hangovers and being sick
* more clear mind
* losing weight
* being healthier
* less embarrassing stories
* less blackouts

Cons;

* less social activities around drinking until i trust myself to stay sober around drunk people
* awkward convos
* possible friend loss

Obviously the pros outweigh the cons even one pro outweighs all the cons

I'm excited to tell my parents when they come down  that hopefully ill have been sober almost 2 weeks by that point

April 16, 2019 was (and hopefully always will be) the lowest point of my life.

Of the countless apps I've tried, the company that makes I Am Sober honestly seems to have the addict in mind. It really helped me put into perspective how much I had been drinking, the amount of money and time I was spending at bars and on booze and most importantly of all.. It made me feel accountable for my actions. 

I do not want this to sound like an advertisement for anything, but more of an advocation. It gives you subtle motivations throughout the day and has you review your day at a set time.

The arrows are not any set time period. Rationalization could happen 24 hours to a year before the trigger. Same with permission giving.

Here’s what I’ve learned- 

- No. one. Gives. A. Shit. About me not drinking. GUYS - NO ONE WITH NON-DISORDERED DRINKING CARES IF YOU’RE NOT JOINING!!!! I think I may get this tattooed on my forearm. 😎

-My mornings are almost euphoric. Better than any feeling wine ever gave me. I’m up first. I’m grateful for my alone time before the chaos of the day. My eyes are clear, my hair feels healthy, I’m not in a fight with my head anymore. 

-You actually can have good conversations when sober! I always waited until about the 3rd drink hit to start asking real questions (you know - like “how are you really doing? lol) YOU DON’T HAVE TO WAIT TO HAVE HUMAN CONNECTION- do it now, it’s so fulfilling! 

-I remember where we parked every night. I pay attention to what my body needs. I remember to reapply sunscreen. I laugh because I’m happy, not manic. I focus on how grateful I am to be having this experience, instead of figuring out how to get my next drink.

I never thought I’d last on a trip like this. I almost cancelled my flight. Instead, I realized the invisible shield that my sobriety is. Protecting me from my worst moments.

To which he replied ""I'm such a disaster, I wrote down the wrong day, haha"". (he texted me the day before to confirm day and time, so I'm not really buying that. 
Anyway. He said he would be there in half an hour, and idiot!me decided to give him a chance and wait.
Only his behaviour triggered a lot of my self-worth issues; I often feel like I am not important, that nobody cares or is interested in me, and this kind of confirmed my worst fear.
So, the make me ""feel better"" I ordered some champagne. When the guy finally showed up I'd gone through the better part of a bottle. 
He is... Not great. And I, being a fucking idiot, keep ordering cocktails and getting abysmally drunk to somehow cope. (Spoiler alert: it didn't help)

2020-02-05 06:25:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ez8653/four_hundred_days_of_learning/,Four Hundred Days of Learning,"Hey, SD. I wanted to post something about this milestone, but instead of taking a victory lap, I wanted to share a few things I wish I knew when I was just getting started.

&nbsp; 

**I had to do more than just existing without drinking.** This is probably the single biggest piece of advice I can give anyone who asks. When I first heard the term ""dry drunk"", I thought it was a pretty stupid notion. I mean, who the hell can be drunk if they aren't drinking? What I've come to realize is my past failures at quitting weren't because I couldn't choose not to drink on any given day, or week, or month, but because I wasn't preparing myself to actually live without it. I was just killing time between relapses. Thanks to SD and a mentor, I have been working on putting together a toolkit to fix the dam before it bursts.

&nbsp; 

**I lost friends I never really had in the first place.** For the first few months, I was pretty socially isolated. I didn't have anything to do that didn't involve drinking, and I stopped hanging out with my friends ... because all we would do was drink. I didn't see that coming. It stung for a while, and I was tempted to go back just to have people to be around and share things with. I don't want to pass judgment here and call them enablers, they wanted to hang out with the ""fun"" s_h_p who could casually order doubles in pint glasses all night long. I started joining meetup groups to do something that wasn't based on drinking, like hiking or volunteering at a local food bank. I wish I had started branching out earlier, the first few months were closer to white knuckling than I would have liked.

&nbsp; 

**Rome wasn't built in a day.** I used to roll my eyes so fucking hard when I heard some cliche about recovery. I thought it was the kind of stupid shit someone puts on a bland greeting card that you buy for a problem that can't really be fixed but you still want credit for addressing. ""In these difficult times."" ""Thinking of you during your loss."" ""May God's peace be with you in your struggle."" Whenever I heard the famous catchphrase, I got angry. It's not really advice, right? It's absurdly dumb. Might as well tell me to take one breath at a time or only take one shit at a time. Well, the joke's on me. Turns out that sumbitch is surprisingly useful, and it's good to reflect on no matter where I am in my journey. Early on (I'm thinking of a summer day last year in particular), I talked about the meaning of it with some folks in the SD IRC, and it helped me stay strong in the moment. More recently, reflecting on it has helped me stay humble when I'm tempted to rest on my laurels. I am only one day away from crossing the Rubicon and heading back towards the personal hell I fought so hard to escape. With that appreciation, I come here often to get help and guidance from others, to motivate some, to celebrate some, and to make a daily commitment to you. If the bread and circuses fail, at least I will know I've made a promise to you.

&nbsp; 

I will not drink with you today.",40
2020-02-05 06:11:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ez8107/swinging_and_sobriety/,Swinging and sobriety,"Hopefully a quick question for anyone that may have a similar experience.  Luckily I’ve stopped digging to find bottom and life is good.  I drink daily and certainly more than I like to. So it’s that time in life to move on past booze.  I’ve seen a lot of posts concerning friends/bars/hanging out and all the advice seems spot on.  Here’s one though. My wife and I are swingers and we love just about everything about the lifestyle.   Drunk is heavily frowned upon and we are both very careful and “try” not to overindulge on our “play nights”.  Unfortunately, totally sober, while not explicitly frowned upon, is definitely out of the norm.  I think we have strategies to combat the “alcohol insistence” but curious of those that may have made a similar decision and participate in that lifestyle.  Thank you in advance. 

(I’m aware that some/most may not agree with our lifestyle. It’s ok, we don’t mind, as long as you are enjoying life the way you choose we agree with your choice. However, any advice that’s “stop swinging because..” won’t be particularly helpful to us.  We love it, I just can’t have one or two like most people we interact with).",11

The drummer in my Husband’s band announced that he has been sober since last June!!! He does not like meetings so we did not go to any of the onboard ones that happened twice a day. We met for coffee nearly every morning on the top pool deck of the ship. Onto the music recap. Hi lighted names were my favorites &/or the most rocking bands. Wednesday, Cruise Day 1, I saw The **Bottle Rockets**, Jim Lauderdale Band, **NRBQ**, **The Waco Brothers**, **The Super Suckers** & Steve Earle & The Dukes! Day 2 we docked on Key West til 4PM & I stayed on the ship to lay in the sun with Husbands keyboard player’s SO. Also wanted to be available to Husband as he was working his ass off on cruise already! Music this day I saw **Kris Kristofferson & The Strangers** (great to see him again but he will be 84 in June & he is frail. I cried 4 times during the show. He did Bobby McGee.), **Kinky Friedman** without The Texas Jewboys!, Went to the Unofficial World Premier of The Mojo Manifesto Documentary at The Renegade Cinema. Official World Premier of this movie will be at SXSW’s Film Festival next month., saw Shooter Jennings (so not his daddy), **Folk Uke** (these are the daughters of Willie Nelson & Arlo Guthrie), **Mojo Nixon & The Toad Liquors**. Day 3 Friday I saw: **The Yayhoos**, **Warner Hodges Band**. Lucinda WIlliams, Elizabeth Cook, **NRBQ** ( can’t get enough), Jason Ringenberg, Son Volt, **Sarah Borges** (Country’s new star babe?), **Bottle. Rockets**, (ROCKING AGAIN)! Day 4 2/1 we docked in Falmouth Jamaica where I did get off the ship for an hour, to get our granddaughter a cute little Reggae dress! Then I saw: **The Mavericks** sail away band on the pool deck outside!, Jesse Dayton, **WACO** again, The Mastersons, **Mojo Nixon & Friends Party Set** which included Rocky O”Riordan (SOBER), Warner, Dan Baird, Jeremy Tepper, some of the Waco boys. Sunday was our fastest day at sea. I mean they hauled ass to get back to Miami! Even with pre-medications & wrist bands, I vomited from 0600 to about 1500. Still managed to catch **Sarah Borges** again! I think I am fan crushing on her! I probably scared the poor girl! Also saw: **Robbie Fulks**, Waylon Payne, went to an autograph session to support Husband, not to get autographs, then we saw bits & pieces of repeated bands & **Rosie Flores**! NRBQ closed down the cruise Sunday night & I could not have been happier about that! I’m sure I am forgetting one or two bands as there were 47 (I think) bands on the ship! Already looking forward to OCC #6 next year when the cruise will go to 6 days long! To anyone who read all this, THANK YOU! And yes, I am still a Crazy Music Groupie Even at my age!",5

Part of this whole journey is about really getting in tune with who I am as well. This is a holistic approach. This means it’s okay to say no to something I really don’t want to do. I have few friends, but they are ones I trust. I don’t need a million acquaintances. 

Right now it’s time to get back into healthy eating, focus on what’s really important, drink a ton of water and revisit my goals.

I'll be OK and will not reset. Thanks guys

Someone who knows I'm not drinking sneaked alcohol into my food. I started realising it was there as I was eating but I compelled to eat because I trusted them and because they were encouraging me to eat because they said the food was delicious. At the end I said ""There was about 60mL of sherry in that cake."" They said ""Was that not OK for you?"" I said ""No. That was fucking vile. You know I don't want to have alcohol""

I'm very angry, but anyway that's enough of that story. I feel like my sober streak is ruined, should I reset my ""I am sober"" app and my counter here or do I just pretend this didn't happen? Has this happened to anyone else? What the person did aside, what is the best way for me to deal with this to move on?

Sorry I know I'm probably overreacting but I have never been sober this long in 20 years and now I feel like everything is screwed up. I'm really disappointed because I went through a lot to be sober for this long. I considered making myself throw up immediately but I had just ate a big dinner and it seemed pointless.

The alcohol tasted completely disgusting btw. REALLY bad, literally tasted like poison, like toilet cleaner. Over the past few days I've been missing drunk times and wondering whether I could ever enjoy alcohol again. But this event made me feel completely certain that I never want that stuff again. YUCK

Thanks for any advice",4

I act consciously to reduce negativity in my life (WFS acceptance statement #2)*

Yesterday my fairweather college friend came over for dinner and brought a bottle of wine. I wasn't ready to tell her that I was trying hard to stop drinking, because she is super judgy and is 1000% that girl that will go around telling our other friends be the first one say something icky when I relapse. There's also a chance that I'm not being fair to her by assuming this will happen, but speaking from 10 years of experience. So anyway, I had a smidge to be polite and chalked it up to trying to lose weight. As you might guess, that ""smidge"" turned into three glasses. 

This is my third day of drinking since I made it a full week last week. I'm so full of guilt and self-loathing, and I just want to be able to drink like everyone else. I keep thinking that if I was smarter, better, more disciplined then I wouldn't have this problem. I also know that's not exactly true, but I can't bat these thoughts away yet. 

I need to be able to treat myself with more kindness and keep promises to myself. Its weird that its easier to keep up appearances and make other people feel comfortable, but so hard to be good to myself. 

Today I'm pulling up my big girl pants and actively trying again. I'm pouring out the bottle of I have hidden away in my desk and starting Day 1.2 today. Every time I bark at myself, I will remind myself to be kinder and gentler to myself as a I try again.

Im a 22 year old man. I've come to terms that I'm a binge alcoholic. I have probably had over 50 blackouts from going out with friends. I am always the one who drinks the most. I am a complete ass when I am drunk and I have lost many relationships because of it.

I did not hit rock bottom after last weeks black out but I felt done. I'm done with the anxiety, done with laying misserable for 5 days after a hard weekend. I never go out and want to black out, I just can't control it.

I told my mom that I am not drinking for 90 days, she is well aware of my black outs. She has been mad at me for it over 100 times. After I told her she first laughed like there was no way I would make it. I told her that I class myself as an alcoholic. She laughed again and told me im not, just that I am immature and WEAK. That word just sliced my heart. I don't belive that I am weak. When I am sober I'm a great, funny, charming and strong person. I started drinking at 18 years old to fit in. I was bullied all my school years and did not connect with people. I had strong social anxiety. When partying and being drunk I felt connected. 

The black outs started from day one and has never stopped. After my first black out my friend told me that every person have one of those. The fear of it happening again will control my drinking for the next time. Never happend...

 My social anxiety when being sober is now gone and I have many great friends that I can connect with. I don't need alcohol as a fix anymore. It just makes me feel bad and gives me unsolvable problems.

However after these words from my mom I have started doubting myself. I want to be motivated for a new and better life.

 Has anyone else been in the same boat? Has anyone else shared these same feelings? I need any help that I can get.",9

 So yeah i've been trying to quit drinking properly for about 9 years ... usually because something bad happened, or a girlfriend wanted me to cut down etc.  about 3 years ago i really tried and started AA and read books and achieve like 2 months, and in between that time i've had a month here and there.    
I'm really really want to give up now soon bad.  I stupidly booked 3 holidays for my birthday.  been on the first one, got too drunk, came home tainted soul and penniless.....i cancelled the second one because i was so much in the horrors from the first one.   BUT now the 3rd is approaching, it's to Iceland....I really really want to go as its just a beautiful place seemingly, and want to see northern lights etc.  

I was looking at warm clothes online to buy and then this little thought came into my head of sitting in a nice bar, drinking and chatting and meeting new people.  and then i text my friend i'm going with (who i'd already made clear that i didn't want to drink on the holiday, and she's happy to not drink in support) and told her i'm going to have a few drinks there and keep it civil.  In a dream world i would fucking love to do that, but the past has shown me that i literally just can not do that anymore.  i've a few drinks and have a merry night, wake up the next day and have a breakfast, then hit the beer again and don't eat the rest of the day, blackout and wakeup and drink again and by day three the horrible person within me comes out....  anyway i'm sure a lot of people can relate to that old chestnut....  


My point/question is, what do you think i should do.....go there with the intention of not drinking and try to plan everything to a 'T' and pray i don't drink, cancel the trip and hit 90 AA meetings in 90 days, go there and try have a few drinks on the last night so that i cant turn into the madman i become after 3 days??  i know the answers staring me in the face maybe but i'm hoping someone has maybe had a similar situation and has some good advise for staying off the sauce on a holiday so i can see Iceland!

It's what pushed me over the edge and made me drink too much. I just had so much work to do. So much pressure on me. Fall and early winter of 2019, I worked from 8 AM to 1 AM next day, pretty much everyday, and I would have nightmares about failing to meet deadlines (I run my own business).

Starting to drink at around 4:30 PM seemed only fair. It's romantic, right? Like in the movies! I work too much so I deserve a reward. Well, it stopped being romantic when I delivered sloppy work to my clients, or the night when I drank so much I pissed in the laundry basket (in front of my family) thinking I was on the toilet.

I'm currently 75 days sober and feel better than ever. Of course I do. It's so logical it's almost dumb. Removing fogginess and constant hangovers = feeling better. Not having this constant back and forth between the real world and the fog makes you more balanced. You remember everything that you did last night. You can actually work effectively in the morning.

And yes, about two weeks into my sobriety, I made a few calls and made sure I don't have this ridiculous workload anymore. That's the beauty of quitting. You actually start solving problems instead of forgetting about them for a second.

So, for anyone on the fence about quitting because you think you won't be able to handle the stress, I promise you'll come to cherish your inner balance even more.",12

But this is the lesson. My drinking is the problem, not my ability to keep it together while drinking. I'm upset because I'm trying to communicate something and I'm actually not having a hard time, but any friction is chalked up to me being drunk. 

So the lesson here, my alky friends, is that as long as you are unable to be sober, you actually don't deserve credit for keeping it together while drinking. You are a drunk and she knows it. Don't ever assume otherwise. 

Stop drinking! (And my goodness, that's so much easier to say than follow through).",3

By relapsed, I mean I had made it a few days on and off starting stopping, but have been deep into it nightly since the Saturday before last. I've tried to stop more times than I can count. I had a few months sober before this began, and the withdrawals were pretty normal..they sucked, I had the sweats, anxiety, and nausea. But recently when I try to stop, it's like I can't breathe. I'm at work and can never catch my breath, and if I don't drink at night it's like I have to force myself to inhale and I'm unable to do so without sitting up and making myself take a deep breath. I've medically detoxed before and done it on my own before..and like I said, I've only been drinking again for about a week and a half, so it's not like I'm way deep in this again. Has anybody else experienced this? I've never been afraid of detoxing until now. With just a week and a half back in, I'm not afraid of seizures..maybe I should be? This symptom is something I'm completely unfamiliar with after having done it so many times. Any insight would be so great right now..",5

The temptation to drink diminishes with time. 

However, there is the occasional time where I am in a very angry, nihilistic, depressed mood that I think “fuck it, what would it hurt to drink again?” Then my rational mind interjects and defuses the drinking thoughts. 

What has saved my ass many times is thinking how i’d have to reset from 200+ days to 0, and i’m not having any of that! 

Be on your toes and do your best to avoid situations where a bad mood could compromise your sobriety. 

Also, if you were drinking to subdue emotional pain, buddy-up with the pain of having to deal with life stuff sober! I embrace the pain a lot more now and use it to my advantage/to grow as much as I can.

The longer your sober streak, the more realizations you have. You gain insight into yourself, you evaluate your habits more, and you learn (or re-learn) about life. 

Sometimes I think that having felt such utter darkness confers a greater understanding and appreciation of the light.

Remind you of anything?,"47 days ago I had my last drink of booze at age 53 after 35 years of booze and weed. coincidentally I had gotten seriously into doing yoga just a few months prior. like every single day serious.  and then I quit the booze and the yoga stepped up even more in terms of difficulty of class and my strength and stamina. when I started six months ago I was a bloated red faced middle aged white schlub.  and since quitting the booze the weight has literally fallen off me. my facial features no longer obscured by a layer of beer blubber.  i look good!  everybody tells me how younger I look and you can tell they're not bullshitting me by their actual look of surprise and tone. I do 200 crunches before every class to strengthen my core (aka lose the remainder of the beer belly). But the best part is the sense of calm that I get out of it. I am seriously chilled out just like the yoga stereotype. Actually, no the best part is the unbelievable sexual stamina I have. that's right ladies, yoga is like magic. I don't even break a sweat and I can go for ages. And ages. So what could go wrong here? I'll tell you. Today I got up at 530 am to do a demanding six o'clock class.  And then I went 'Fuck it' and I did another class from 8-9.  And I felt great. And then all day I was plotting at work to sneak in another class. which I did at 530 pm. And hour and a half long vinyasa flow class. And then it hit me. I was using all my old addict skills to do something that made me feel good again. I was being sneaky and ultra-focused to get that feeling again. Every day. Sound familar?  This is a serious actual addiction. Three and half hours of anything in one day is extreme. It's weird to see all the old tricks coming back. People joke that I traded a bad addiction for a good one!  Yes. but as an addict it still feels a bit weird.

My friends stopped me from getting in a fight with some guys who were upset with how I was acting towards girls they were with. I peed on my friend’s couch last weekend and was thankfully woken up still drunk just in time to make an important work conference. 

Now I’m finishing day 2 and am luckily not feeling any detox symptoms except for fatigue. 

I am grateful to be sober again and wanted to share some learnings with y’all as us humans can be similar: 

I learned that I got complacent pretty quickly. “I can control my alcohol...I’ve been sober for five weeks...”

I learned that life was so much better in so many ways without alcohol. The benefits far outweighed the negatives. 

My friends were mostly supportive, and I began to learn how to interact with those were not. 

I learned  I hadn’t become a moderate drinker just because I took time off.

Things I noticed during my time free of alcohol (I would say I really started to notice these things two weeks into sobriety):
-increased energy

- decreased shame/guilt —&amp;gt; decrease in anxiety

-far better decision making, almost no self-sabotage (I think that came from being unhappy with myself, which came from the poison)

-I felt I could take myself more seriously but take life less seriously, both in the good sense

-Improved mood

-sleep finally regulated!!! 

-increased focus—&amp;gt;increased efficiency in work production and reading speed

-mental clarity and decision making improved

-verbal fluency improved, I am sure of this

-I thought about others more!!  Called my mom, family. responded to friends with thoughtfulness and ❤️

-friends said I looked better and happier

-girls all of a sudden seemed way more interested in hanging out (that was a surprise because I always thought my wild side was a charming aspect—what an obvious rationalization huh?)

-I think a sense of humor that used to be frequent, and I didn’t really realize had waned, started to come back

-I felt I had more time and that I used my time better

-I exercised more and lost weight 

This honestly is just a small list because everything in my life seemed to magically improve! There were still tons of aspects of my life that I need to work on, but damn saying no to one thing can make a biiig difference. 

This exercise has felt useful towards cementing my resolve. 

I am really glad this community exists, it fits my style. I have been reading your posts today and there is so much positivity. 

When, with luck and strength, I make it a year I am going to get a puppy! ... that is something I have wanted to do for a bit, but alcohol would make me a bad puppy father, let alone human father.",4

I was on the verge of death when I quit drinking. I had given up, or at least I thought all that life had to offer was a vicious cycle of barstools, key bumps, stale cigarette smell, and endless guilt. Some of the side effects from not drinking were surprising. My sense of taste came back, and music sounded different. Colors were a little more vibrant, and I saw things from a different perspective. The weight loss was the most surprising. I wasn't expecting it to be so drastic, physically and mentally. Obviously, I felt better physically, and buying new clothes because what I had no longer fit was a good problem to have. People started treating me differently. I'm not sure if it was because of the physical aspect, or I just presented myself differently due to my new found confidence. I made slow changes to my life at first. I slowly left the service industry. An industry plagued with addiction and bad habits. I don't blame them, and don't think negatively of my fellow brothers and sisters in the kitchen, but I'm glad I don't live that life anymore. But with all that cooking experience, I can definitely feed myself quite well. I followed my passion and actually got a job in the photography business.

We had been working through some things and the was the first time he had actually strung these words together. It was kind of cool to be there for an “ah-ha” moment of his. He goes on to compare an addict’s relationship to alcohol like a victim in an abusive relationship. First it’s all fun and flirty and everything is great. The more time that goes on there are some signs that maybe this relationship isn’t good for you, but you ignore them in hopes that the small things won’t lead to the bigger things. But they inevitably do. You start to see the effects it has on your every day life. You have a great time with it the night before, right before it pummels you into the bed with anxiety and embarrassing actions. Then it promises to make things better, and you let it. Next comes the isolation of the disease, where alcohol just doesn’t want any interruption between you and it. First your flighty friends go, then some of your more important friends, then your best friends, before you know it, some of your family start to distance themselves. Pretty soon it’s just you and alcohol, right where it wants you. And that’s how isolation is the opposite of recovery.

Starting over today for at least the 500th time. 

I’m gonna tell myself its the 777th time, that way its lucky, lol.

Nothing written here should be interpreted as an excuse. 

There is no excuse for me right now.

I slept until 4pm today. I normally get up at 5am.

My side hurt. I’m assuming it was my liver, although I am not too familiar with internal organ locations, but that spot always hurts a little after a night of drinking.

I have not gone more than 2 weeks without drinking in 7.5 years. 

I have tried and failed to get sober more times than I can count. 

I want to so badly.

I have been single for 4.5 years

My last girlfriend left me because I would get drunk and say wacky stuff, sometimes depression/suicide related. Looking back, I don’t blame her for a second.

It took me a long time to get over that one (or drown it, I guess)

I have no social life

I drink an entire bottle of cheap vodka or whiskey in a single night at least once a week, usually twice a week.

Smirnoff or Seagrams 7. I don’t like to try new things. I’m unpredictable when I do.

Beers or a pint of vodka or a combination of the two most other nights.

Always at home. Always alone. 

I usually do so while sitting at my computer playing games or playing my guitar for about the first half of the bottle. For the second half, these activities become to difficult, 

so I just listen to music until I black out and fall asleep. 

There’s a 50/50 chance I put myself in bed on the full tilt nights. Otherwise I usually just sleep on the couch, although occasionally I find myself on the floor, still sitting in my chair, or even in the bathtub (although that’s only happened a couple of times. I think of it as a super rare Easter egg). 

About 6 months ago, I tried to get up off the couch and fell over on my brand new coffee table, breaking it in half.

That was difficult to explain to the person who was at the door. That’s why i was getting up. It was a woman that I’d been seeing. She laughed it off, but not really. She became harder to contact after that.

About 3 months ago, I was walking to my kitchen and fell onto my new metal trash can, denting it. Now it doesn’t close.

If i were to injure myself and cant get to my phone, No one would know until I didn’t show up for work for several days.

That’s scary to me.

I’m being dramatic.

My neighbors avoid eye contact with me. I think I rant when i get really drunk. I can never remember if i was saying those thoughts out loud or just having them in my head. 

If i do say them out loud, it likely sounds very strange since I live alone and they probably are incoherent half-thoughts.

I have psoriasis on my knuckles, elbows, knee, leg, and ankles. Drinking makes it worse, and tomorrow I have a follow up doctors appointment for the medication I am supposed to be using for it, but I don’t really know if it works because I am counteracting it with alcohol (if i even remember to use it, which I don’t half the time. Hard to remember these things when you’re drunk.) 

I cant tell the doctor how much i drink. My insurance will go through the roof.

Im not really sure what to do about that.

I have attended AA meetings before, but found them very strange, and my anxiety basically had me paralyzed and mute. 

I saw that eye roll

My hands are starting to shake. 

Probably just dehydrated.

It feels really good to type all of this out.

An additional 12.5% stopped drinking, leading to an astonishing 57% of the population around the world living the alcohol-free life. In america specifically, the combined total is about 46%, compared to a majority 54% of current drinkers. 

So if you ever feel like the odd one out in a social situation because of your sober lifestyle, it might help to think about just how ”normal” you really are.

I think I’m still dealing with the overindulgence this weekend. Not feeling quite on point. Eating habits a bit off, not a heck of a lot of energy. Trying to maintain a healthy diet and drinking a ton of water. 

My mind is still a bit foggy but there’s some short bursts of clarity.  Considering I basically spent all of yesterday hungover, I would expect for today to be a bit rocky as well. 

I can’t figure out a lot of things about my drinking habits. I will completely overindulge when I’m here, when I’m with friends. Let’s say I go back to my hometown. I can simply have a glass of wine with a family member and leave it at that. I can sip on a beer and leave it at that. When I’m here though, where I live, I can’t. I can’t say no. I can’t hold back. I can’t figure it out, therefore I’m not going to. No solution is the best solution, because it means I choose not to drink.

Yesterday a good friend of mine, who is a huge part of my friend group, died unexpectedly. I’ve been sober for 2 months and 1 day and have not had a sip through this whole ordeal. 

He was at my house for the Super Bowl and was completely normal. We all had a good time together and he and his brother crashed at our house because they had been drinking some. The next morning, I left for work and heard my friend snoring in the guest room. When I got to work , my roommate texted me and told me to call him because it was an “interesting” morning at the house. 

Apparently my friend woke up about 20 to 30 mins after I left, went downstairs and ended up laying on the floor next to the couch. Shortly after, he started puking everywhere and couldn’t form sentences and words very well. At first, my roommates and his brother suspected he was just really drunk and were annoyed  with the situation and him puking all over the place. It quickly became apparent that this was something serious and 911 was called. 

He wasn’t able to stand on his own so they had to pick him up and put him on a stretcher. Upon taking his blood pressure he was like 260 over something. Insanely high. He had been hospitalized for BP related issues in the past and was prescribed BP medication but I was told he didn’t take it for whatever reason. 

At the time of the initial phone call I made from work when my roommate told me to call that morning, Mu buddy was in the hospital and we all thought this was a crazy BP situation and that he was lucky to be alive and lifestyle changes needed to be made. He drank and smoked a lot and didn’t exercise much. 

Within an hour or so of that call, I got a text saying he had a major brain aneurysm was on life support and wasn’t going to survive. A couple hours after that and he died. I was able to leave work and visit him one last time. As I’m writing this, I’m with his brother and a few friends, at his parents house where he lived, going over funeral arrangements and going through all his stuff. 

What would’ve been a situation where I drank excessively to suppress my feelings is now a situation where I’m dealing with all of this completely, 100%, sober. It’s hard but I’m glad I’m clear minded and present for all of this and I’m proud to say that I’m still continuing my 2 month streak of sobriety. 

You never know when it may be your last day on this earth so IWNDWYT.

TL/DR: A good friend died unexpectedly yesterday from a massive brain aneurysm that happened in my house shortly after I left for work. I haven’t drank whatsoever during this ordeal and am processing everything sober and am continuing my 2 month streak.",79

For quite a bit of my career I was a senior supervisor with huge responsibility and massive budgets to work from and I was extremely well compensated for my work. (Oilfield) the work dried up and the industry came to almost a stand still. I was left looking for a new career to support my family. Seems pretty straight forward right. 

I found myself having to take jobs that Deep down were “beneath my skill level” and  “I was worth more money” ya sounds bad. I was only doing it to support my family. As time went on and my level of importance, title and pay dropped it intensified my depression I think and was a factor in my dependence on alcohol to cope with my feelings of inadequacy. 

I can admit this now that I look back and it’s time to let go of what WAS and focus on what I AM. I don’t need to make obscene money every month to survive and a title it meaningless if there is no work for that job. I recently took a job in the same industry as a vac hauler. A hard and dirty job. But damit its where I am at and I’m going to be the best vac hauler the patch has ever seen. It doesn’t mean I’m not going to try for a different job as I continue with my sobriety. But today I’m a vac hauler and I’m going to give it my all with no preconceptions.

Had been AF since New Year’s Day (anor binge on New Year’s Eve).

In both cases, I was feeling happy and good, accomplished and in control before opening a bottle of wine - nothing seemed amiss with it.

In both cases, a single bottle of wine was enough for me to black out and lose control.

The difference in the days before and days after is so stark- it is like stumbling off a cliff you didn’t realise was there.

It feels like the world changes in the space of a day. How I wish I could go back to Monday morning - a regrettably familiar feeling.

How do you retain in your mind the feeling of this sick low when some time has passed and the focus is off?

I am so eager to believe that I’m cured that I embrace any positive development .

I think this is what allows me to have another drink down the track- ‘one or two is fine and normal’.

In my heart of hearts I recognise that I must be strictly AF.

But I also know that at some point I will feel a sneaky pint or something is a treat I deserve.

That’s enough to normalise drinking again- which inevitably leads me back to disgrace.

She has a chapter where she talks about different experiences she had that made her recognize that she has a problem with drinking and needs to stop. She calls them ""convincers."" I thought it might be therapeutic for me to write out some of my own convincers. So here goes: 

August 2019

My grandmother and her husband are coming to visit my husband and me for the weekend. My grandmother likes to drink wine, but in a normie way. I've been trying to control my own problem drinking since oh, 2016-ish. I've been pretty successful at moderating the last few months, partly because I started taking an anti-depressant for my anxiety in June and the instructions caution against mixing it with alcohol. Interesting how I am willing to take medication everyday for my anxiety, but not quit drinking and see how that might help...

She is texting me wine emojis before she arrives. We don't see each other often enough for her to realize I have a problem with alcohol. She thinks it's fun drinking with me. I open a bottle of rose and am halfway through a glass before they arrive. Another glass as we catch up. A beer at dinner. More wine when we get home. More and more and more for me. 

The next morning I open my eyes cautiously, wondering exactly how much pain I will be in today. My husband is looking at me that way that makes me feel like I am going to die of shame. I don't fully remember the end of the night. He tells me that I tried to fall asleep in the bathroom again. He tells me he's not trying to make me feel bad, he's just worried about me. 

I start the day off not feeling the worst I've ever felt. I make us breakfast and coffee. We decide to go see a movie and on the way there I start to crash. I was probably still drunk when I woke up. The hangover is setting in now.

The movie starts. I'm too hungover to stomach popcorn. I can't focus. I start to feel like I can't follow the incredibly simple plot of the movie. I start having a panic attack. I keep going to the bathroom to get out of the dark theater for a few minutes. I'm texting my husband from the bathroom to come out and tend to me. I make him walk around the block with me because if I stop moving I feel like I'm losing my mind. I beg him to take me to the hospital, but he knows I'm having a panic attack and tries to calm me down. I tell him this is it. I can't drink anymore. What am I doing to myself? Am I trying to hurt myself? Why do I keep doing this? What's wrong with me? 

We do this until the movie ends. I start to feel better. I make my poor husband intercept my grandparents as they leave the theater and explain to them that I'm feeling very anxious and just don't make a big deal out of it. They look concerned but act like nothing's wrong. I get through the rest of the day somehow and we don't talk about it again. 

I get drunk again the next weekend.",29

I dreamt last night about drinking. All I want to do today is buy a bottle of vodka and buy lots of food and be drunk and happy eating. It’s difficult to live life without the alcohol stopper. 
Alcohol just.. stops everything. I stop feeling and reading I just zone out and exist. If that’s even existing. 
I would hit my regular spot for liquor, mix my vodka and whatever juice in the car and set out. As I’m typing I realize how problematic that is just in itself.. I’ve blacked out multiple times driving home and how I’ve never hurt someone or myself is beyond me. I remind myself when I’m sober how bad that is. 
Okay.. change of plans... don’t drink in the parking lot just take it home and get sloshed. But then it’s so lonely. But also who would I want to be around? Drinking isn’t about being social anymore. 
Then the anxiety of hiding the bottle.. hiding the smell.. resisting the urge to drink a glass at 5:30am before I head out to work just to “wake me up and get my head straight”. 
I’m tired and I haven’t even done any of these things today.

Then I checked my messages, my friends were worried if I had gotten to my sisters house ok, I had fought with friends over text about random things. I wasn’t really hangover, but the way I felt after realizing what I did was worse than any hangover I’ve ever had.

I woke up scared as hell. I’m so scared of falling of the wagon and being like that again. Not really scared, more like terrified. I know the chances of it happening right now are slim, I’m in the right track, I don’t miss being drunk and am able to have fun without alcohol. But sometimes it’s like I’m waiting for the day I fail myself and everyone else again.

And when I do drink in social settings I cant turn it off.  I used to never call into work but I have several times over the past few months.. my energy is shot to shit. Its almost impossible to keep up with my fitness goals, my anxiety and depression are off the chain etc etc.   But Im so scared to tell the ones I love.  Did anyone else have this problem?

This isn't the first time I've had 90 days in the last year.  Some of the things that are different this go around include working the 12 steps with a sponsor who has 8 years, residing in a sober living house with 10 other guys trying to do the same thing, and really getting honest with myself.  90 days ago my life was in complete shambles.  I lost my job, wound up in a detox, only to drink 2 more times in the next 2 days to oblivion.  Waking up in the emergency room with absolutely no idea what happened scared the living shit out of me.  I knew I had to change.  Something inside of me knew this was not working, and I believe I had what some refer to as a moment of clarity.  Treatment for 76 days, working with a sponsor who is taking me straight through the big book, finding my higher power and turning my will over to my higher power every single day has begun to create some kind of change inside of me.  The promises of AA say that things will change sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, but they will always materialize if we work for them.  
I'm not exactly where I imagined I would be at at this point in my life, but today I have hope that as long as I don't drink or use, I have a legitimate chance of loving a happy life.  I'm so grateful to my sponsor, AA, the people I've met in the program, and everything I have in my life today.  I have people I call friends today, my relationships with family and old friends are consistently improving every day.  I'm so grateful to be sober today.

I’ve recently gotten back into the program after three years of sobriety (on my own) and a pretty crappy relapse that made me realize I’m not equipped to do this by myself for the long haul. 

That said, I’m having a hard time adjusting to a life of constant meetings. Currently my sponsor has requested that I go to 4 a week, which I guess is pretty standard in early recovery and might even be recommended long term - haven’t gotten to that yet. I absolutely recognize the value of frequent meetings, but I work full time and have a 1 1/2 year old toddler, so my life as I once knew it is now completely full and I feel like I never have a free moment to just chill and be myself doing nothing anymore. 

It’s this kind of feeling that’s caused me to leave the program before and I know that isn’t the right choice for me, but damn do I miss a life with minimal amounts of freedom. Have any of you experienced and overcome a feeling like this? I’m well aware that I’ll lose anything I put before sobriety so meetings must come first, but it’s a hell of a pill to swallow knowing this will be my forever. 

Thanks in advance for any experience or advice you can offer!",4

I finally took a normal poo today. That poo sang like angels at the birth of the Baby Jesus.

First constipation and BLACK poops, with the smell of a rotting corpse. Then diarrhea. Then explosive poops. Then, in the words of our fallen sister Amy Winehouse, “Back to Black.”

I see very clearly I should have gone to the doctor this relapse. The black poop probably signified upper digestive system bleeding or some other horrific bodily malfunction. Glad it’s back to normal. Scheduling a check-up to make sure my body isn’t secretly shutting down.

I finally feel amazing. Hot yoga and cycling are the new booze. Never relapsing again, by God. Pride cometh...

AA has a booklet of questions.  Do you drink alone etc. They only had boxes for Yes or No leaving out the all important **yes, but it shouldn't count in my case**

I was a master of rationalization and justification - did post graduate work in it. But towards the end the lies I was telling myself were pretty transparent.

I made sure there was someone in my circle who drank more/harder than I did - so I could point and say, ""I'm not THAT bad.""

Truth was I drank a lot - too much - when I started my off switch was pretty much non functional and for all the efforts to control it - I wasn't able to - not really - and if I did somehow for an occasion I was pretty unhappy and felt deprived (and made up for it soon after).

In the beginning I was hung up on the definition.  And it prevented me from doing something about what even I considered a 'problem'.  Truth is the exact category does not matter at all.

what it boils down to is....

I had a deep seeded friendship with partying and alcohol so this was the most momentous event of my young hot life. Naturally I hit the bars as hard as my wallet could afford, it was not a pretty week. The next weekend I was out drinking with some coworkers and blacked out.

 Next thing I remember was coming to in the back of a cop car being asked about a home invasion. Apparently a cab was called for me and I was dropped off in front of the wrong house. I must have thought it was my house and my roommates were not letting me in (locked doors and all) so I sat and beat on the door screaming for at least an hour. At some point during this, a poor older man who was terrified some crazy person was trying to murder him and his wife, got out a rifle and shot at me through his front door. 

Thank God he missed. I then kicked the door a few times and fell asleep in his driveway. I went to jail for the night, faced felony charges which were lowered to a misdemeanor charge. I did not stop drinking. 7 years years later I was still trying to convince myself I could moderate, control myself, just drink beer and be fine. I am just now finishing my probation requirements and may face jail time for not taking care of it 7 years ago. But, I am today 3 months sober. Not because I have too, but because I can finally see how foolish I've been all these years. 

Sorry for the wall of text, hopefully someone might read this and stop downplaying their situation like I did. Take an extreme example of alcohol abuse and make a molehill. Take action instead of letting alcohol rule your life. It's been hard, but it's never impossible. Hope everyone has a killer sober day!",8

Yesterday was a roller coaster: awful news in the morning, great news in the afternoon, and not-so-great-not-so-terrible news in the evening. To top it all off, I had to dogsit for my parents for a while after work, two rooms away from their garage which features two old fridges full of any kind of booze/beer/wine you could imagine. 

But for all the gut feelings I had, ""*Today was stressful, you deserve it*,"" ""*that opportunity is amazing, you should celebrate*,"" etc., I stayed true to the course and made it home. I even found time to exercise, catch up on work, and have a delicious dinner. It turned into a quiet night.

I guess yesterday was a lesson that with sobriety comes all of the emotions that daily alcohol abuse numbed into oblivion, and that living sober means actually processing those feelings and moving past the painful ones. It helps to take it out on the treadmill and relax with a book.

I could have easily died. If anyone reading this thinks of doing the same, please dont. Withdrawal is a critically serious medical condition that requires medical supervision. I got lucky. 

I relapsed on a month long bender. the first two weeks were about ten drinks a day, the final two were at least a liter a day of vodka, some days more. I experienced my first blackout (actually, my first 4, within a one week period) and finally decided i needed to stop. I am married and have a job that is effectively the starting point for my career. i somehow managed to convince my wife i was just really sick. apparently i hold my liquor well, though she did remark that i was ""off"". I stopped this last thursday night, having my last drink around 6 pm. i have had relatively minor withdrawals once before, some light hand shaking and sweating for three days then feeling fine. This was radically different and a living hell. I woke around 4am with my heart slamming so hard i could hear it in my ears and see my neck pumping each beat, hundreds of times a minute. this was the first moment i realized this would be a different monster from the last one. 

i laid down and stared at the ceiling for hours, trying to calm myself down and telling myself it was just a panic attack. around 8 am i stepped into the living room to sit in the morning light, and realized that when i closed my eyes i was hallucinating terrifying creatures. I told myself it was just a hallucination, but it didnt take away how scared i was to realize i was in a truly intense withdrawal. when i opened my eyes i realized the hallucination wouldnt go away. i watched a massive skeletal butterfly just hover and look at me, sweat pouring off of me, my heart racing. 

This was the peak of the hallucinations, but i continued to hear audible voices for a couple days after. During this period i was near constant vomiting and had diarrhea, to the point that i couldnt rehydrate, giving me a massive headache. this lasted for a day, finally subsiding after a horrendous night of sleep. 

the next three days were filled with constant sweating and shaking, decreasing each day. Sleeping became a terrifying ordeal as i would fall asleep, have a night terror, wake, then repeat the process all night. last night was the first night where my dreams werent terrors, just extremely vivid, while still waking between each one. 

i still woke today with a sweat covered blanket, but my head was in the right place finally, and i am able to really settle into the idea that i am beyond the worst of it. 

This was simply the scariest thing I have ever been through. The fear of seizures, or death, or my wife thinking i was something besides ""sick"" and leaving...it was downright traumatic. I will be going back to AA  tonight after work.

i've accomplished one month or very close to it every year since then but always allow myself to get dragged back to everyday and binge drinking....and then feel shame, remorse, and disgust. and , of course, i worry about my health and my wife and kids do too. i'd like to change but am worried i can't or won't. guess its time to prove it to myself. i quit coffee three months ago as a precursor signifier of change but damn, i sure miss that too--tea sucks ha ha. anyways, its early in the month and i'm grateful to find all these post with practical strategies, pep talks, and encouragement. wish me luck! and thank you.",4

Backstory:  Been drinking since I was an late teen, now mid-40s.  Never responsibly when I DID drink (binged) but justified my drinking because I never drank during the day, rarely on weekdays, but EVERY weekend and EVERY holiday was an excuse to get wasted.  Heard a quote recently that said something like ""If you want to see the character of a person, look at what they do between 5PM on Friday and 8AM on Monday.""  For me it was being SUPER drunk at least one of those nights and SUPER hung over at least one of those days.  A sobering moment.    


Which led to a 2020 sober January which has been great...and I plan to continue staying dry.  

Q: A few times in the past month I have had something *like* Deja Vu... where it's kindofa memory, kind of strange feeling, could lean towards a panic attack but I know how to work through those from the past.  Has anyone experienced something like this?  Most of January I was fine but, 30+ days later, I'm noticing maybe my mind is different...not good, or bad, just different.  Any thoughts around this?  Any scientific research?

I know, I know...whhaaaaaa!  Woe is me.  I have amazing, huge, positive life changes coming up in the next week but I am hardcore stressed about them. I am afraid that I will not be supportive enough, or maybe have not been supportive enough, or that my anxiety (which is always something I struggle with) will cause me to be stressed and therefore stress out others whom I should be helping to keep calm and feel confident.  Dealing with some residual guilt regarding past behaviours (which I know I cannot change, but still, I have a very hard time letting go), and some of the fallout in relationships where I did try to make amends and was open about how I felt in those relationships and where I was coming from in why I felt stress and fear sometimes only to only end up making the other person feel bad and totally messing up the whole situation and adding strain.  One of those situations where you consider being really open with someone, feeling really burned by it, then not wanting to be open again.  I am not saying that I am not going to be open with people (and I am probably not doing a good job of describing the situation, and I do not want to throw others under the bus for my own faults) but right now I feel like I am not doing a great job at relationships.  I feel like others are upset, or hurt, or frazzled, and I am trying to reach out to be there, but I am not sure if I am actually making anything better or if I really can because of the past.  The desire to hide away, to make the feelings go away, to hide under the sheets, to drink, to call in to work, to be alone are all making themselves known.  I am not going to drink and I am going to try to reach out and be there however I can.  I feel so tired in the core of my emotions, but I will get up.  I will get done what needs to get done.  I will be present to my best abilities.  I plan to go to sleep sober tonight and tomorrow night.  This is the way.  Thank You.",5

I live in a family where everyone drinks, and I really want to stop drinking, because I don't get along with alcohol, like many here in the group.

The problem is that every weekend there is a barbecue with my family somewhere, and the temptation to drink is very cogent ,because everyone is drinking and offering ..I think I'll make other appointments and not show up at barbecues anymore.

how do you escape these situations? where you have a lot of drinks and people offering.

thank you for your attention.

I will not drink with you today.",5

Currently in university after I took a gap year where I basically worked 40 hours a week and spent most of my free time getting shitfaced. One of the main reasons why I chose to go to university was because of the ""social life"" (aka, went to my mates unis, got smashed, enjoyed it at the time), however by the time I actually went I'd taken 2 months of sobriety and was looking forward to doing the course.

However, once I started I just kept going out, at least twice a week, with each time my drinking getting more out of control as I have no self-control once I start. Heck, I don't even think I have self control as to when I start. I decided to do dry january, and was doing quite well until I stumbled into a situation when a drink was handed to me. I took it and I'm sure you can guess what happened next, stumbling back at 5-6am. Many people I've spoke to consider my drinking to be ""harmless"" or ""what we all do/did at this age"" but I know mine is not. It's directly affecting my life, education, social life outside of ""getting smashed with the boys"", any sort of motivation I have. Testament to that - being on a 3 day bender the past weekend and only just now being able to cook myself some proper food, have a shower and talk to anyone.

I'm too scared to tell my parents or family yet as many of them also have suffered/suffer from problems with alcohol themselves. However, I'm seeking out meetings in my area and going to see a counsellor at my university tomorrow.

I’ve been drinking daily for a few months, and mixing with benzos, too. Stepping out into the laneway behind my house in the mornings to knock back a tetra pack of wine, getting up at three in the morning to take more benzos and drink more lager and wine. I’m also a married father to three kids under five years old. Not a good situation. 

Anyhoo, was held in a psychiatric secure unit nine days ago (long story about how I ended up there), so I’ve been sober since. The detox was a little rough, but survivable. 

I’m not claiming to be a talented writer, but writing down my struggles as poetry has really helped. Here’s what I got. I hope at least one person finds something they can relate to in it. If not, we’ll, you’ve got to be willing to put yourself out there:



Untitled – 3 February 2020

There is a fear of drifting away:

A perishable passage through a membrane of judgements
Between accusing lips
Parched on one side
Sodden on the other:
The boundaries stretched to rupturing.

Lie between the deceitful chaos of swollen realism
And the tender sigh of affect that modest medicine brings to life. 

See the wooden cudgel
A cruel spear of anxiety and fear that pivots nearby
And follow the cursed hickory towards potent, chimerical waters. 

See that sobriety is the clear-sightedness of the absurd;
To be drunk is to attempt to make the preposterous a legitimate thing. 

Settle in weak brackish waters,
Where the faint brine of your pillow becomes your rum;
So that which evaporates the thoughts of hopelessness
Dries also the fear of drifting away.",5

2020-02-04 10:49:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eyrzah/35_days_sober_new_to_the_community/,"3.5 days sober, new to the community","I want to introduce myself:

* Age 39
* Started drinking every day at age 27
* Did the math, at my current consumption rate of roughly 7.5 drinks per day, that's 32,850 drinks over the last 12 years

Why did I start?  It began when I was 24 and started work for the Federal Government.  I was a daily pot smoker before that, but with the need for a security clearance, I knew I'd need to pass a drug test.  

At that point, I was a *very* rare drinker, and didn't really care about getting tipsy/buzzed on alcohol.  So, to get some kind of buzz, I started taking a shot or two when I got home from work (before dinner, empty stomach to maximize buzz), maybe 3 times a week.  That was it.

Then, my wife unexpectedly got pregnant when I was 26, and my world came crashing down.  I didn't want a kid, and I was seriously freaked out.  Still managed to keep the drinking under control until he was born.  Having a baby in the house was a nightmare, I didn't feel bonded to him at all, wife was a ball of stress 24/7, so the daily drinking began.   I'd say I drank 350 out of 365 days in an average year.

Slowly worked my way up to the point that I couldn't really get drunk off of ""normal"" cheap 4.5% light beer because I couldn't drink them quickly enough (so much liquid), so I started taking sips from a bottle of hard liquor to ""augment"" (woo!  more intense buzz, and faster, too!).  Eventually switched to 2 or 3 beers per night + about 1/3 of a bottle of hard liquor, and maintained that for a decade.  I would try to quit maybe once every year or two, make it a few days until the cravings/insomnia got too bad, and then got right back into it.

I also stopped eating dinner entirely on most nights so that I could ""save some calories"" for the alcohol and not gain a ton of weight.

I know, I know.  I didn't start drinking until 4 or 5pm, and I've managed to keep it under enough control that I don't have any physical withdrawal symptoms.  I'm not a ""hardcore"" alcoholic.  But it's enough that I woke up every morning for the last decade with a least a little bit of the spins, feeling like shit.  Diarrhea every day.  Upset stomach every day.  Triglycerides through the roof. I'm a software engineer, so I need my brain working properly, and it absolutely wasn't.  

The real last straw was Friday.  I was probably 6 or 7 drinks in, my wife said something to me that I interpreted as snippy, so I said something snippy back.  Drinking doesn't make me an asshole, but it does entirely destroy my ""filter"" and I just say whatever comes to mind.  So apparently, I *am* an asshole underneath, and booze just exposes it. 

Anyway, she went to bed right then and I didn't talk to her until the next morning.  She was furious, said I was like Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, and that she was going to stay with her Mom for about 24 hours to ""cool off"", something that has *never* happened before in our 16 years of marriage.  I stayed home with our kids, ages 9 and 12.

Our kids are wonderful, I love them to pieces.  They're smart and kind and they deserve better.  So after my wife left for her parents' on Saturday morning, I called it quits.  For good this time, I hope.  Wife is being very supportive. 

So I'm about 82 hours in and feeling...pretty good.  But I never have cravings during the day, only once 4pm rolls around, so I just need to maintain for about 5 hours a day between getting home from work and going to bed.  Just have to drive past those grocery/liquor stores.

Wish me luck, I'm going to need it.  But I'm fucking MOTIVATED this time.

------------

Important edit:  My wife is *also* an alcoholic, but that's only cropped up over the last 2 or so years.  She used to worry constantly about my drinking, and then she decided she really liked Hazy IPAs and began drinking almost as much as me.  So co-dependencies abound.  Her drinking around me doesn't tempt me at all, so we've agreed that I'll ""go first"" and stop drinking, and she'll follow in a month or so.  Don't want everyone to be stressed out all at once.

Also....the self-loathing I felt walking down the liquor aisle at the grocery store every other day...something I definitely won't miss.",15

Drinking makes me feel like I'm treading in cold water. Unpleasant, but it makes life seem more manageable in some ways. If you're only focused on getting through the day and surviving, you don't have to think so much about bigger issues. However, there's no growth, no progress.

I haven't been back since before I quit and I knew it was going to be a trigger filled weekend. I made it through unscathed but there was quite a few very pleasant surprises as well. The one thing that really caught my attention was almost everyone I ran into that hasn't seen me since before I quit was commenting how great I looked (without knowing I had quit). This really solidified in my head that quitting was a great 

(the best ) decision. The other thing that I enjoyed was the reaction my friends had to the news that I had managed to quit. I was nervous to tell them and they were all so supportive and uplifting. 

That being said, I didn't quit for them. I quit for me. I wanted to improve my life and the best way for me to that was to stop drinking. I feel like since I have done this there is no limit to what I can achieve. 

This is such a great feeling, I want everyone to feel this way. The best thing is you can. I believe that you can, I know that you can. If I could stop YOU can stop. Just never stop quitting. Keep trying. What's important isn't that you failed, but that you kept trying after you failed.",14

1. Make a physical list of things you are going to do today.  Diet, chores, basic things around the house.  This might sound funny but it helped me to have something physical.... written in my own hands.  When I would have a craving I could revert back to my list and say, ""is alcohol on my list""?  Or go to the mirror and look yourself in the eyes and say, ""Is that who I want to be""?
2. Get ready to fill the holes.  For many of us drinking just helped cover the holes or turn a blind eye.  Find someone be open and honest or r/sd but it really helped to have someone that understood outside of A.A. (didn't work for me but still helped understand how addiction works)... In the beginning your support system is your life line.  
3. DON'T GET ANGRY AND DON'T BE ALONE.  I can't tell you how many times I've failed from a emotional second.  Seriously,  a second is all the addiction needs to break the ice and be right back to square one.  Never turn your back.
4. Research the addiction and alcohol.  There are many documentaries on youtube about the later stages of addiction.  Including the biological and physiological sides of what it does to you and your family.  The more knowledge I gained the more it was easier to say ""No, I'm not drinking today"".  This may feel like getting sober is all about you in start but its easier to say i'm not drinking today for the benefit of US.  
5. Don't over over think others reactions.  Its your choice not to drink, not there's.  Come up with a default list of quick comebacks/ reasons you can revert back to when that famous question comes, ""why aren't you drinking""?
6. RELAX can't over stress this one enough.  Every night I lay one my acupuncture mat from amazon and kick on some light mediation music on youtube for 10 minutes and do a few breathing exercises.  4-7-8 method is a quick and easy one to start with.  Quitting drinking is just much about your mental health as your physical health.
7. Exercise even if its taking a quick walk around the block.  Keep busy the more busy... the better!

I'm sure there are many others might edit later but I'm off to work.  Stay strong guys!

I didn't, and got an even more disgusting hangover. Not just physical, but emotional as well.

I felt disgusting, piking, crying, lazy, fat, depressed, malnourished, and in self inflicted pain. 
I decided to stop, and I got a huge 4 day depression that left me almost unable to communicate.

It’s important, this obsession on sobriety. This continual reminder that I have quit drinking. To keep saying the words so as not to minimize what is really happening here. It feels like I’m in rehab, my own little reset. Not necessarily to dry out, because there were no withdrawal symptoms other than the usual day after detox (although, in all honesty, there were a few days of deeper detox, where I could feel some subtleties. Hard to distinguish between that and the pollens in the air, but still.) I know there will be a time when I am not so zealous. That’s what the new routines are for. That’s what the writing is for, to go back and look. A renewed hobby, in a way.  That’s why I’ve made the journal a small art project, to retain my interest. This is how I’m using the AA/rehab model for myself. Not just a week or two of good behavior. Actual behavior changes. Immersion. So far the things I’m learning are not new concepts. I’ve used them before. But it’s good to be reminded and to apply them to this new task. Practice. I am practicing sobriety. Strengthening a muscle.",17

I now take charge of my life and my well being I accept the responsibility. (WFS Acceptance statement #1)*

So, I drank the last two nights. A bottle of wine Sunday night, two glasses last night. I'm not even sure why I did. The worst part was, I didn't even feel guilty about it like I feel like I should have. It was just a matter-of-fact, ""I would like some wine, so I'm going to have it."" Woof. I don't really know what going on with my brain. I had a full 7 days sober, and then something in me decided ""okay, that's good. We're done here.""

I feel like part of me doesn't want to acknowledge that I have a problem with drinking yet. I'm in my 20s- I feel like I'm too young for this and I'm not ready to deprive myself of social drinking with my friends. But the other part of me is like...I can't handle social drinking with my friends until (or even if) I get my nightly-lonely drinking under control. And then part of me is like...do I even have a problem? What qualifies drinking as problematic? Its all very topsy turvy.

What I am seeing though, is that I can't stop fixating on these thoughts. The fact that my relationship with alcohol is creating anxiety and I can't kick these thoughts out of my head, definitely says that alcohol is a problem for me. It also looks like I'm treating this problem like I treat most of my other problems- by putting off dealing with it until something happens that forces me to deal with it. That's always what happens when I'm the only person holding myself accountable. Its much harder to keep promises to myself than to others. I've seen what alcohol dependency can do to people, and its a scary thought. I need to be able to give myself the strength to stop myself before I get to an extreme- but I also feel like I'm punishing myself by depriving myself.

I am taking a little break from overt quit lit this week and reading a sort of 101 level illustrated history of China but I’ve also been reading Roger Ebert’s autobiography and as it happens, he’s one of us. Each chapter in this bio is around a person or event in his life. Chapter 26 is “Alcoholism”. 

Ebert realized he had a drinking problem in 1979 and went to his doctor, who prescribed him Antabuse, on condition of him having a “helper” to serve it to him each morning, and AA. He was on the antabuse for the first month. He went to AA meetings for the rest of his life until his cancer made it basically impossible for him to speak aloud. He loved AA. He says he knows that some people view it as cultish or pushy with religion and he says he’ll never argue with anyone who feels that way: “The last thing I want to do is start an argument about AA. I tell people, don’t go if you don’t want to.” 

I’m not writing this to open up the AA can of worms. Please do not start a pro or anti AA debate in this thread! I’m writing this because what I found touching about his love (yes, truly he loved it) for AA is the same as what I love about you guys here at SD, this community. He says that he just loved being able to seek out a meeting no matter where in the world he was and have great conversations with random strangers from all walks of life. It’s how we lovers of drink experienced bar culture, but quit drinking support groups find all of us in our post-bar lives. 

One thing that struck me the very first time I visited SD was our pledge: I will not drink with you today. As a drinker, I always sought out companions who were like-minded on alcohol. The most important question I would have put on a theoretical application to be my friend would have been “will you drink me”? It was such a part of me to think that way that when I saw and heard that question’s inversion here, I knew I had found a really like-minded group. 

I like to think that Roger Ebert is now in the great movie theater in the sky and he’s not drinking with us today.",28

AA is not for me but I definitely really need a support community.

Today marks 1 week since my last drink.
Last summer was kind of a turning point when I ended up in the hospital to detox from some milder withdrawal symptoms (no DTs or anything like that); but I have failed to keep too much of a handle on control since then. I spent too much time convincing myself I just needed to cut back instead of giving effort to being sober for awhile. Ever since the experience at the hospital I suffer from very severe anxiety as a result of drinking too much.
I have this pattern now of taking a couple weeks off, then thinking I can slowly ease back into having a few drinks which is fine for a bit until it turns into daily stops for a few drinks which eventually turns into a blowout night. I then spend the next day or so writhing in anxiety/insomnia, heart pounding, blood pressure soaring, puking up everything I put in and realize it’s time for a break. Rinse and repeat.
Im worried for my health and for my sanity and for my relationship (I know he’s as worn out from all this as I am) so I’m really attempting to make more of an effort than I have ever put into a real alcohol free period. It’s time to break some serious bad habits and compulsions and stop dragging my partner down with me. He has been my rock through this whole thing and I owe it to him and myself to do my best.

My doctor recommended I commit to at least 6 weeks alcohol free. It will be the longest I have ever been without a drink since I was 18 years old; but this is my immediate goal and the hardest part so far has honestly been the boredom and sporadic sleeplessness.

tl;dr I’m 1 week in to trying out 6 weeks sober and I’m struggling with boredom from actually having coherent free time and insomnia.",4

I'm a recovering alcoholic who can't seem to make it work.  My long story started with about 10 years of functional alcoholism and it eventually led to the inevitable consequences.  I have been arrested twice for DUI.  I have hurt the people who mean the most to me. I have physical effects we're all familiar with.

 I have made a consistent home for myself in AA for about 2 years. I have attended 3 meetings on average per week for that time.  I spent 4 hours in meetings today and still know in my heart I am going to drink today or tomorrow.   I attend meetings and even chair regularly...but I have yet to get beyond 3 months at a time actually sober.  I don't take coins anymore because I'm tired of the charade.

I know everything rationally.  I know drinking makes me feel worse in the long run.  I know I'm wasting time and money. But ever since my last dive into drinking I can't hang it up for more than 4 days at a time.  

How do we stay sober for the long run?",3
2020-02-04 02:30:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eymi4u/the_beginners_guide_to_giving_up/,The beginners guide to giving up,"That is a trick title. There is no definitive guide. Everyone is different and everyone got to the point they are today by a different route. You have to find your own way, but I have tried to do is pull together some of the things I have learnt from my fellow SDs. The wisdom is theirs; the mistakes are mine.

1. Support is essential. The alcohol impaired brain has difficulty in absorbing information and retaining it. So, in the early days of sobriety there is a need for constant re-enforcement of information. Attending AA meetings or reading SD does that. Early days can feel empty and lonely as there is a hole where drinking and drinking buddies were. Your support group makes up for that.

2. Physical withdrawal sucks. As a rule of thumb if you are drinking a bottle or more of spirits a day I suggest to seek medical help stopping. Seriously, it can kill you. Physical withdrawal lasts about 10-14 days. This website Verywellmind “Stages of Alcohol-Withdrawal Symptoms From Day 1 to Day 30 and Beyond” will give you some idea of the many and varied symptoms you may encounter.

https://www.verywellmind.com/is-this-normal-how-long-will-it-last-80197

3. Cravings suck worse. The cravings are caused by psychological addiction. Addiction is a complicated subject and it is a powerful force. It is a battle that takes place in your head. A voice is telling you “It’s ok, you deserve a drink”. You sorta have to learn to stand aside from yourself and learn to recognise that little voice. Then have a sensible voice that says “No you don’t”. It is a bit schizophrenic. Cravings normally last about 10 minutes and you just have to distract yourself and cling on.

Dr Kevin McCauley’s talk on Youtube - The Brain and Recovery: An Update on the Neuroscience of Addiction, is very good.

4. Knowledge is power. The key is to change is understanding. Two books helped me. “This Naked Mind” by Annie Grace and “Alcohol Explained” by William Porter. They really made a difference.

5. One day at a time. This is the absolute  key stone, lynch pin, bed rock to success. Set yourself a simple and achievable goal. Get through today. 

6. Triggers – habits. Patterns of behaviour trigger drinking. Opening a bottle of wine as you step through the door; stopping at the same bar on the way home. Routines must be changed to avoid these patterns. Work out your trigger habits and change them. Quitting involves lots of changes.

7. Triggers – friends. Birds of a feather… Drinkers socialise with drinkers. Most are not your friends; they are enablers to your problem. Avoid them for one month. You will find out who are really your friends and who are just drinking buddies. Friends will understand and support you in quitting. Buddies will fade away. But it can be lonely - see support above.

8. H.A.L.T Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired - all trigger that F\*\*\*\* it moment. Wild mood swings are not unusual in early sobriety. Stand aside yourself and look yourself. See schizophrenic.

9. Time. Not being comatosed means that you are aware of time. Lots of time. It can feel very empty and boring. See support above.

10. Be kind to yourself. This is hard. Remorse and regrets are normal feelings for decent people who realise they have done stupid and hurtful things. You can’t change the past, just your actions today. Time will heal. 

This is a simplistic guide to a very complicated and difficult topic. Lots of themes such as PAWS, relationships, change etc. have been left out.  I thought long and hard about doing this piece. It feels arrogant and I am acutely aware of its many failings. I hope some will find it helpful.",57

I'm also so tired of feeling like I'm trying to grind out a successful life.

Since stopping drinking I feel less ashamed, healthier, and more in line with a real version of myself. But that real version isn't turning out to be great by sober default.. 
my lizard brain tells me why does it even matter, it feels like my peers who drink are finding easier, more rewarding paths in life. To be brutally honest I guess a part of me feels entitled to be happy because I take all the right steps that are supposed to make a person happy.

&#x200B;

I grew up around video games, mostly consoles. I still remember Atari 2600 and 2800, playing Pit Fall for hours. The Komani Code and Contra was a young boys dream on Nintendo. When I turned 16 and found booze and girls and the gaming slowed down a bit, plus I was a 2 sport athlete.  The booze took over my gaming time expect for those epic Golden Eye death matches and Madden.  Back then multiplayer games were a real in person social event just like drinking.  They just fit.

Faster forward to age 23. I had pretty much stopped gaming at 19 due to college sports, school famous, drinking, driving, and partying.  I was very good at partying, and an exceptional drunk driver. The only time I ever gotten close to a DUI was after 1 1/2 beers and blew a .068. Yeah, .068, I hadn't even begun the debauchery.  I could drink all night with little sleep and still make school, work and practice.  Then came one night of partying I will never forget. 

I'm at a new friends place getting ready to smash a 12 pack. I noticed his roommate on PS2 with a Headset talking Made Shit, MADE SHIT!! I asked who the hell he was yelling at and what he was playing. He said he just ""One Tapped"" a dude in the face and let him know just how Garbage he is at Socom.  I thought, ""WTF is Socom? Playstation? Online? Shit Talking?"" You can get online with PS2 and talk to random people all while poppin nugs  I asked? Little did I know this evening would dictate my life choices to this day.  

I am competitor, I must admit.  I played football in college, Threw Shot and Disc, played pickup B-Ball, you name it.  I grew up trash talking and pitting my skills against others. I had to try this. I lost this by getting older.  My friends were getting married and working every day.  Getting that competitive fix was not there as much and I wanted it all the time.  Booze was filling the gap more and more and now this  Socom has arrived.  You see it was the first online Console shooter game and it was fascinating, fantastic, and raw. XXX, guttural and lawless.

I picked up the Sticks again and started Getting Good. Full on gaming for hours after work during the week. Then drinking and chasing girls on the weekend. I did not start off drinking and gaming so much together at first.  It was casually drinking, mostly to loosen up the Thumbs so I could Rage Quit these Fools for trying to step up to me.  It was epic I must say.  I loved the challenge and the community. I was on Game Battles and all that back then.  Something changed over time however. 

I played every Socom ever produced. I played with my cousins my crew and had a amazing time doing so.  I really truly enjoyed that life after a long day at work.  By 27 I was a successful Investment Adviser and gamer, analytical, smart, and out going (assuming there was a beer around some where). At this point I left my job on a adventure. To travel the country and work a national presidential election. testing my skills and trying to have as much fun as possible. No gaming but not a problem.  I already knew though, to a degree, that my drinking was impacting my life negatively.  I didn't care because I was in control. 

I had a long time off of work after the election do to a bad economy.  It gave me chance to take a break after all the years of hard work.  So I drank a little more and played Socom constantly together.  Then I drank A lot more. Eventually, the series started dying off but I needed more so I started looking at PC gaming. 

I finally quit  advising 2 years later do to the stress, anxiety, panic attacks, and hangovers. Gaming was always there to hold me up though.  I will say it give me a home of sorts and I found comfort in my growing solitude. 

I'm 29 at this point, and out of advising. I lost my girlfriend because I rather drink and play the last dying breath of Socom 4 at home alone. She actually thought I was cheating on her. Like, for real cheating. I am a drunk but I am loyal. LOL! I mean, being a drunk is partially the definition of loyalty. :P Out of all that I found a pin whole of light. Ironically, it was from my new favorite sport introduced to me to by my now Ex-girlfriend. Snowboarding!! That changed my life again.

Coming from the desert of Arizona, it was a world away from what I ever excepted to be hooked on. It gave me so much joy that I got a job in Colorado as a instructor. I lost 50 Lbs and drank much less for a while. What was to be a 6 month adventure ended up being a 5 year journey.  In those first years I was the happiest I've ever been. I tamed my drinking in the dark winters of the High Rockies by building a PC, smoking Flower (Weed to some of you), and learning the sacred art of the ""flick shot"".  I found Arma 3 as my go to for it openness and endless Hardcore community. That did not last forever. I  started the cycle again. 

After poured 5000 hours of Sweat and Booze into that game, and playing almost every minute not dedicated to snowboarding, I just stopped going out.  I started drinking nightly and basically stopped snowboarding too.  Staring at the snow covered ski runs from my window, hungover of course, I just imagined myself being there like it was a world away.  It was right there, I could literally touch it if I wanted. For years I stared out that window. That 7 foot wide 3 foot tall landscape window. 10k feet up, staring down 2k feet into the valley and mountain tops beyond. but I was content to stay warm and drink in my room playing games.  Beside, it's very hard to be hungover and climb 10, 11 ,12 thousand foot peaks at that altitude. This is what I said to my self;

 ""There is tomorrow. But, tomorrow I have another raid on Arma and my boys are counting on me,  but I need to grab some beers for that.  Maybe just a few this time and I will make the morning POW session after this Epic Dump tonight.""

Needless to saw I missed more of those than I should have. 

I had to leave the mountains do to health issues.  Partly from drinking, But mostly front the extreme altitude. So I moved, started a company with a friend and everything is fine now.  Except for the booze and gaming addiction, the anxiety and depression that has always followed me. 

I cannot stop gaming, nor do I really want to. I want to be in that community to a healthy degree.  I must however, find a way to separate drinking from it or seriously cut the intake. Further, I need and want to stop drinking so much so often in general.  Alas, I fear one or both of these tasks is highly improbable unless I dump it all.  What a boring thought.

Assuming I am not alone here,  I am not looking to get cuddled, or find a group of people just like me. To what end? So we can sit in a virtual circle and wallow in the echo chamber of similar misery. That is not my style. I am writing this more for me. 

I am just hungover again. Stressed out about all the work I failed to get done today because I had to sleep it off.  Sitting in front of my PC wondering if will I'll grab a 12 pack or maybe 18 and pop Domes in Modern Warfare until I can't see straight. Or, start talking mad shit to that 15 year old who opened his mouth after snatching daddy's controller, only to catch that sacred ""Flick Shot"" I managed to eke out in my half blacked out state. 

But hey, that is just a regular night for a 19 year old kid and his friends right? At 38 it kinda sucks and makes people think of you the wrong way.  Though I will always love it until tomorrow morning. 

 IDK, I think I'll try to quit drinking today.

I don't drink because I enjoy it I drink because it's the only thing that quiets the blaring static of being present in my own head. 

I've functioned well enough my whole life and can hide it well despite a DUI and countless bouts of risky behavior. I only drink once or twice a week but when I do it's to make up for the rest of the week I'm sober. I'm a professional, people's lives depend on what I do. I cant help but feel like I'm selfish when I'm at work and half of my attention is devoted to trying not to vomit in the trash can. I owe it to my wife who is too good for me. To the people I hurt when I'm drinking. To my poor liver which currently feels like its being stabbed with an icepick. To me because of the countless opportunities I've squandered away.

In terms of physical health, I do feel much better (more energy mostly, no hangovers). But the most significant benefit has been to my mental health.  I'm not even talking about the lessening anxiety (though there is that).  I mean my ability to do the hard, so necessary, introspective work I was actively avoiding for over a decade by way of alcoholism.  This past year, I've been an absent friend.  Quite the extrovert when I was drinking, this past year has seen me become pretty reclusive.  But friends, I've been doing work - thought a lot about my upbringing and finally came to terms with how abusive and neglectful it was.  I forgave myself for cutting contact with my parents.  I came to terms with a lot of personal things that, in my avoidance of them, were holding me back from growing into the person I know I can be.  As John Meyer says in one of my favorite songs (In Repair): ""I'm not together, but I'm getting there.""  And if you take nothing else away from this post but this song, I feel good about that.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlYNey3JQgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlYNey3JQgU)

There were two pieces that were instrumental to me.  My kids gave me the motivation and this group (as well as r/raisedbynarcissists) gave me the support.

You are all so strong and resilient and you have helped me more than you can know.  Thank you for being here.  I will not drink with you today.  <3

PS- I can't believe that I had considered picking up drinking again after a year.  I think that's what I told myself just to get the ball rolling.  ""Give it a solid year, Stoic, and if you still think you love the taste (or whatever other bullshit reason I had for not quitting before) and can't bear to never drink again, you can reevaluate after a year.  That's the deal I made with myself.  The temptation is still there sometimes, but going back to where I was a year ago is such a dismal prospect, I (with humility and luck) will never go back.

When in reality its been too many to count and i got a feeling its somewhere in the 30%-50% range of the times i drink ending in a black out. I don’t enjoy blacking out. Its not more fun than when im on that good level,a fee after feeling tipsy but for whatever reason I cant stop drinking once i start. 

On new years i was craving a beer so bad and ready to drink. I decided in that moment i was going to challenge myself to not drink again until June. I guess to me that meant drink as many as possible with no end in mind. Idk why either. Maybe I feel like I “always got it” but no one can simply continue drinking without blacking out. I don’t remember the exact number but I had at least 15 beers in 2-3 hours. The people there told me i looked straight not stumbling or falling down drunk. Just you know drunk but I was blacked out even if they couldn’t tell which don’t get me wrong not most people can tell when someone is blacked out (at least not at the beginning). Long story short i ended up making a fool out of myself and spending my new years day in bed full of shame, regret, and self-pity. 

I went 13 days before i drinked again on the 13th then again on the 17th and the last time on the 19th where i ended up blacking out again and since then its been 14 days. 

Sometimes i wish it would be 6 months sober already from alcohol so i could feel like i actually am accomplishing something this time but the truth is every single day is what counts. Sticking it out day by day no matter where you are on this road the days sober only go up 1 day at a time.  IWNDWYT",6

I woke up with no memory of how I arrived home from a pre-carnival party. I also woke up with my body covered in bruises and scrapes with a deep cut above my eye, which would have required 4 stitches had I gone straight to Emergency. But no, I was blackout drunk again. I came back screaming the flat down, waking my auntie who had to deal with me... she puts up with so much and I know I am worrying my auntie and grandmother.. SO I am from London, but I've moved back to Brasil and have moved in to my grandmother's. I left London because drinking had taken its toll, I was extremely depressed and suicidal. I stopped recognising myself. I came back to Brasil, to not necessarily find myself, but at least take myself out of a place that was triggering and unhealthy for me. To find a new way of looking after me. It's been 5 months and I feel like its getting worse. This is the third weekend where I have come home with aggressive marks on my body after blackouts...  The other weekend I got so wasted, I flipped off some boys at the bus stop for no reason, They followed me in the streets and beat me up. That I vaguely remember. I know it's my fault though. I have no clue what happened last night. If it was the same boys. If it was others? If I started it. I am not in London anymore and it just feels like a have a death wish. I know I go places I shouldn't. When I arrived in Brasil, I got so wasted one night in the first two weeks, I ended up going to smoke crack with street boys. I get so fucking impulsive, it's a wonder how I am still even here. I'm fucking exhausted. My auntie sat me down and cried, scared that I could get killed. How lucky I have been that nobody had a weapon. She asked me to stop drinking. And honestly, I should. Why does the idea of quitting scare me so much though?? I don't want to be this person any longer. I've always put it off and always found a way to not blame booze... but I can't do that any longer. Drinking isn't, and has never been good for me. I have ruined relationships with people. Lost gigs and contacts. Terrified people. I don't really know what will come next. I just want to be positive. I can't help but feel so heavy and feel like such a burden...",5

*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Tuesday, SD family! We are allegedly going to get some weather tonight or tomorrow- there's finally a glimmer of hope for a little snow. I'm not entirely convinced it will happen. They've been wrong so often this winter. Our weather people don't seem to have a real grasp on telling us the actual forecast, which for me, is like the top thing you need from them. 

But just in case my cynical butt is proven wrong,  I wanted to post before it arrives since our internet is frightened of weather and posting the DCI from my phone is hard. I hope you all have a beautiful day and I will not drink with you today!",90

Wife is away and I got very drunk in afternoon - too much to properly care for our young son overnight. Extended family became involved to provide care.

Wife rightly furious. I am mortified and v ashamed.

I am mostly AF and have had long stints between drinks. I can see that I need to be AF full time.

Lately my reaction to alcohol seems to be getting worse- does not take much for me to pass out or become incapacitated.

I have used diary/day tracker apps with some success.

However, I find that after a month or so, once I am feeling better about myself, I lose motivation to maintain the AF project.

How do you keep yourselves energised in this task?",2

""Binge drinking may induce brain damage due to the repeated cycle of acute intoxication followed by an acute abstinence withdrawal state.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Hunt--7) Based on animal studies, regular binge drinking in the long-term is thought to be more likely to result in brain damage than chronic (daily) alcoholism. This is due to the 4- to 5-fold increase in glutamate release in nucleus accumbens during the acute withdrawal state between binges but only in dose 3 g/kg, in 2 g/kg there is no increase in glutamate release. In contrast, during withdrawal from chronic alcoholism only a 2- to 3-fold increase in glutamate release occurs. The high levels of glutamate release causes a chain reaction in other neurotransmitter systems. The reason that chronic sustained alcoholism is thought by some researchers to be less brain damaging than binge drinking is because tolerance develops to the effects of alcohol and unlike binge drinking repeated periods of acute withdrawal does not occur,[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Ward--3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Crews-2009-4) but there are also many alcoholics who typically drink in binges followed by periods of no drinking.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-8) Excessive glutamate release is a known major cause of neuronal cell death. Glutamate causes neurotoxicity due to [excitotoxicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitotoxicity) and oxidative glutamate toxicity. Evidence from animal studies suggests that some people may be more genetically sensitive to the neurotoxic and brain damage associated with binge drinking regimes. Binge drinking activates microglial cells which leads to the release of inflammatory [cytokines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokines) and mediators such as [tumour necrosis factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumour_necrosis_factor), and [nitric oxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_oxide) causing [neuroinflammation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroinflammation) leading to neuronal destruction.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Ward--3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Crews-2009-4)

Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol which occurs in heavy binge drinkers has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals is believed to be the mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neural kindling may explain the advancing pathogenesis and progressively deteriorating course of alcoholism and explain continued alcohol abuse as due to avoidance of distressing acute withdrawal symptoms which get worse with each withdrawal. Multiple withdrawals from alcohol is associated with impaired long-term nonverbal memory impairment in adolescents and to poor memory in adult alcoholics. Adult alcoholics who experienced two or more withdrawals showed more frontal lobe impairments than alcoholics who had a history of one or no prior alcohol withdrawals. The finding of kindling in alcoholism is consistent with the mechanism of brain damage due to binge drinking and subsequent withdrawal.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindling_(sedative%E2%80%93hypnotic_withdrawal)#cite_note-Courtney-2009-9)**""**",4

Did an extended taper and was able to quit without any real side effects apart from a mild headache & nausea on day 2 and some serious thirst for the first 4 days. Made it a full week, made some bad decisions, got blasted for 2 days, ended up feeling sicker than I did when I quit, got back on track, and here I am. Live and learn, eh? 

Somehow, despite feeling about 50% human about 50% of the time, things have been getting better in both my work and personal life the last 2 weeks. Lack of focus has been the major thing messing with me along with the mood swings that happen almost like clockwork. I know these will pass in time and if I stay the course I have nowhere to go but up. Still can't shake this sort of flat, apathetic feeling I have most of the day. It's like I'm waiting for a bus I know is coming but I have no idea when it will arrive. I'm just kind of sitting there, thoughts drifting, letting the time pass until I can get on with things.

Made it through the holiday season riding high on how excited I was to get sober. Now I'm just... kinda bored.

A few things I do already when I'm craving --

- Go to the gym. I especially like a combo yoga/tai chi class I go to on Friday nights. They call it ""happy hour"" which I think is cute, and it's a good way to kick off the evening when I used to do so with a drink.
- Re-read journal entries about shameful nights when I drank too much and remember how I felt 
- Call/text sober friends who are supportive

But I just feel like I'm hitting a wall. The novelty of sobriety has worn off and now it just feels like a drag some days. I've narrowly avoided drinking a couple nights the past few weeks, and in the morning I'm always glad I made the decision not to, but then by the evening the cravings are back...

It's absolutely true that it increases risk for certain types of cancer. Still, I thought there had to be other factors so I kind of blew it off a little.

Then I find out today that this woman in my AA group with cancer passed away this morning. Turns out she had cancer which started in her gallbladder and metastasized to other organs. I last saw her week before last. She shared she was having a bad week and was stressed out but didn't have much to say. I said, ""See you later"" as I was leaving the meeting and she smiled a little although her face was tight. Now I won't ever see her again. 

I didn't know her well, I wasn't a regular at the meetings until after NYE, but I am overcome with emotion. She was YOUNG to die, maybe 35. The most beautiful blue eyes. They say she was a heavy drinker and had been sober 18 months.

These cravings are getting so bad I’m struggling to function. My BF wanted to hang yesterday but I lied and said I was busy, but really my cravings were just so bad I couldn’t stand being around people. Everything is triggering, every positive mention of alcohol, every alcohol ad, every empty can I see on the street. I get triggered by just being outside, because as soon as I’m outside I get a strong urge to just walk down to the gas station to buy alcohol. I can’t focus on anything. I try to get control of my thoughts, I really really do, but I’m not making much progress. 


I feel like a wounded animal. I pace around my room riddled with rage and anxiety just itching for a damn drink. I feel angry at everyone and everything and I want to be left alone so badly. It’s like my mind goes blank, I lose the ability to think clearly and it takes all my energy to not bolt out the door and buy alcohol. 

I’m tired of always needing help. That’s part of why I struggle to reach out to my Sponsor and other people from AA when I’m like this, because it almost every damn day. I can’t even stand to post here half the time I’m like this. The cravings are less frequent now, but fuck when they hit they totally shut me down now. 

It’s even worse now that I’ve jumped from “fuck I want a beer” to “I want to drink until I physically can not drink anymore”.

Quick vent/ update post

This week I’ll hit 13 months sober. Pretty awesome even if I do say so myself. 

The insomnia is back again lately. It comes and it goes. Loads of stress so not a surprise given everything my family and I are dealing with lately. 

One thing I wanted to muse on was anxiety and emotional control. During the “wet times” I drank to keep anxiety “under control”. Since quitting I’ve had to learn to deal with the fact that I suck at emotional control and coping with anxiety. It’s amazing how small things can tip me into a funk or anger and how hard it can be to climb out of that depression hole. 

I’m thinking of starting some counselling just to discuss some of this with someone neutral. 

Makes me upset when I lose it with my family. Before I wouldn’t have said anything because I would just drink frustration down. Now I express myself and sometimes I sound like a controlling nut case. 

I guess being aware is the first step to improvement. 

I didn’t really anticipate that quitting was going to turn into a massive journey of introspection, self reflection, relearning self love, self control and how to be a nicer human. 

The insomnia makes it challenging to stay level through all of this. 

As always, this is worth it. But the suck it’s kinda deep at the moment. 

Ok, I’ll end my little pity party there. Thanks for always being here SD. 

Embrace the suck",5

It wasn't unusual for the group of us to throw back some drinks when we were playing but about 5-6 years ago i started to notice that pretty much after 9-10pm he'd be really out of it and at some point go silent and just leave without saying anything about 20 minutes later.  This became his MO.  We'd even poke fun at him about it the next time as it became a predictable end to his night.  I eventually realized he was getting so drunk he'd have a hard time focusing on the game or literally fall asleep mid-game due to being so wasted.  

It's also become very apparent to me that our groups gaming time was his primary socialization and now in his mid 30s he has very few ""real life"" friends, if any.  The only one i think he actually sees with any consistency is one guy who moved in with him about 2 years ago.  I don't know if he still lives there, but outside of work, I think it's safe to say that's his only interaction with people.  Although we rarely play games together these days, he's always on, but i rarely am or i jump on at the very end of my day for about 1 hour.  At this point he's usually so drunk and likely feeling extreme shame he won't join in, if he's even awake, which is increasingly rare.   When his girlfriend broke up with him a few years ago, the drinking really seemed to spiral out of control and he's been spiraling down ever since.  


We talk semi-regularly over text and he's confided in me that he has a major alcohol problem and wants to quite but can't.  I've also had several conversations with him where he is in tears because he knows his dying from his addiction but cannot stop.  His dependency has progressed to the point where he cannot stop cold turkey or he may die.  He's tried to ""taper down"" and quit a million times, but just cannot do it.   He's in his mid 30s and beginning to see the effects that of decades of alcohol abuse have on the body and if things continue, I can't imagine he'll be alive to see his 40th birthday - maybe even not his next one.    


I am not a psychiatrist, but i've heard unresolved trauma's are often the reason people drink.  From what i've gathered his dad wasn't around a lot and wasn't a great guy, his brother committed suicide and he never dealt with that properly either.  I have personal experience with suicide (my brother also killed himself) and alcoholism -  spent about 5 years as a functional drunk, but about 3 years ago I told myself i'd quit for 3 months just to prove i could do it and just never went back.  I know this is highly unusual and i'm terrified of relapsing but so far so good, i guess.  The kids are a huge motivator.  It would crush me for my son or daughter to have a drunk for a dad - I couldn't live with myself, but I'm in a much better place these days.  Sober life is good.  I rarely have an urge to drink and it's not very intense)

Anyway, I'm mentioning this because in a small way i feel like this could have been me if things has been a little different, if i had not had the right people/support in my life, etc.  


He wants to quit - badly, but it's just not enough.  I get the sense he just doesn't have a reason to quit.  Nothing to live for.  No reason to aim higher.  So he just plays video games and drinks, the excessive drinking makes him shameful, the shame feeds the isolation, the isolation brings despair which makes him drink more.  Rinse. Repeat.    


I know and believe the old saying, you can't help an addict unless they want to help themselves, but I also feel like I'm just doing nothing while my friend slowly kills himself right before my eyes.  He's halfway across the country so not being physically present also makes it difficult to intervene in a more drastic way.    


I know there's no magic words, but any advice you may have that worked on you or someone you know, would be greatly appreciated.  Love the positivity in this group.  You are all lovely people whether you realize it or not :)",2

Saw mirror images of drinking “me”. It wasn’t pretty.,"In the US, the Super Bowl is a bit like Mardi Gras.  Another excuse to drink amongst large crowds.  Plus, Miami is a great place to let loose and have fun.  With over 15 months of sobriety under my belt, drinking is not really all that appealing to me.  However, being in a loud crowd with people spilling drinks on you is not the best place for someone like me.  So I put limits on my time.  After one hour, we left a bar full of Chiefs’ fans and had dinner.  Not drinking during the game was easy largely due to the fact it is largely a wealthy and corporate crowd.  That doesn’t mean they can’t be alcoholics, they are just a bit quieter about it.  As we were leaving the game and took a long walk to get our Uber, I witnessed a fellow alcoholic getting yelled at by his partner over his drinking.  The alcoholic threw  phone at his partner in a fit of rage.  It was a scene and argument all of us are familiar with.  My partner and I nodded at each other as a sign of gratitude that those days are over.  Thank God.  I am so glad I didn’t take a shot of whiskey the day before.",40

I ate grilled chicken all last week, and I guess I ate a little bit of undercooked chicken. I’m through the worst of it, but am zapped of energy. I had a planned day off of work, and did a defensive driving course this morning, got a light 30 minutes at the gym. And though I know I need the rest, and laying in bed, I’m starting feel locked up in my apt again, and strangely it is causing craving thoughts - so weird, like more poison, will help me get rid of this other poison.

I also realized that just about every meal I have had at my apt in the past year and a half I have been either drunk or hungover. I have had 3 or 4 sober meals here now, good but still feels little weird. Never thought that’d be something to adjust too

I’m also on a new eating plan. 4x a day, as opposed to 5x a day. And there are a lot of logistics consider. It’s not too bad, I’m locked to a desk 9 hours a day, I am able to dial in feeding times, but it’s still a little wearing to thinking about it.

I may also have to move my exercise, which scares me the most. I have been going pretty directly after work, still needing to occupy my danger zone. The gym I go to now will at least until 6:30 or 7 and I’m worried I will tire out and lose motivation waiting for the gym to clear out a bit. I could got at like 2 pm, but then have all evening to kill, and I’m still kinda tied financially from starting too many new activities. Maybe one more month. I feel silly to go to a coffee shop to buy coffee and read, when I can sit here and make coffee and read. 

Just a lot of nagging thoughts like that. Tomorrow should be fine, I should let some of these thoughts go. But, still getting a little stir crazy, and not feeling too hot. I’m about to make another sober meal in my apt, then probably crawl back into bed. I know it’s what I need. Just need to tough it out tonight

2020-02-03 16:48:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/eyenne/my_one_year_reflections_long/,My One Year Reflections [long],"Man, got so busy I forgot to check in here when I hit a year!  To all you sobernauts out there - you rock and keep on keeping on.

With that said, let me see if I can collect a few thing I learned over the past couple 24 hours and put them in writing:

1. Early sobriety is hard because on top of trying to overcome the physical and mental addiction part of things, it is emotional and confusing.  Alcohol was my best friend, confidant, and comforter in hard times.  It almost felt like a messy breakup or the death of a loved one.  How could I ever have fun again or look forward to things without them.  I felt empty and meaningless.  I had put so much time and effort into this relationship for naught.  Who was I without it? I was having to go through this without the one person I leaned on most in times like these.  Allow yourself to mourn if you need to.  This will pass.  You will learn who you are without alcohol and how to enjoy the things you already enjoy sans the buzz again and cut out the things that you only liked because it led to booze.
2. No good change in your life comes without working for it.  Whether you 12 step or not you will need to try to put together the broken pieces back into something resembling what it was or something new altogether.  No one got in good shape by buying a gym membership or got a dream job by hoping for it.  You have to put in the work to get the result.  Try to mend relationships. Sometimes a mosaic of the broken pieces can be more beautiful than the original.
3. You have to practice sobriety.  Every time you hang with a friend, go on a date, attend a football game, watch Netflix or whatever sober, your brain breaks that dopamine association between that action and alcohol and rebuilds it with genuine enjoyment instead.  Each time makes it stronger and easier the next time.  The first anything will generally trigger some itchy feelings, cravings or FOMO but each time these lessen until they are gone completely.
4. Forgiveness is huge.  I did a lot of my drinking because I didn't like what I had done and who I had become.  First you need to ask for forgiveness from yourself and then grant it as you can.  After that, you can begin with others.  Both asking for and granting forgiveness for the past.  Try to recognize the wrong YOU did and minimize the hurt you feel from others actions.  You can't change the past, only what you do from here.  Think of resentment like an injury or illness you put off seeing a doctor about because you are scared it will hurt.  All the meantime, you are miserable and it is only hurting you!  Sure a surgery will be painful and uncomfortable, but it mends the root cause and allows it to heal cleanly and you will be rid of it for the rest of your life.
5. Once you get past the early physical and mental addiction parts, sobriety becomes a choice.  Each day I have to the choice of short term numbness from whatever pain, problems or reality I perceive to be too hard at the possible cost of everything I have worked towards and built in sobriety or to be present in the life and reality that I have put in place around me for better or worse.  I think of the concept that Steinbeck introduces of ""timshel"" in East of Eden.  He says that we are given a choice in everything that we do whether or not to overcome sin.  Each character is faced with difficult situations and either choose the path towards redemption or the easier path that is selfish and ultimately leads to worse things.  I see the same in my life with small choices either leading toward my sobriety or away from it ultimately leading to my happiness or my failure to maintain it.

I have rambled too much.  Hopefully something out of that babbling made some sense to somebody.  Thank you all for your experience, strength and hope.  It got me to where I am today.

This sort of came to me a few weeks ago after watching some notable NFL players retiring earlier in their careers because they don’t wanna put their bodies through anymore pain. It makes sense to me though. I had a good career.. lots of parties, travelling, Las Vegas, Thailand, Europe, a lot of great summers drinking with friends. Now it seems that my body can’t take it anymore, especially my mind! It’s almost as if I’m developing CTE (haha hopefully not). I’ve had one beer on Christmas Eve and before that i got drunk the last time in early October. I absolutely love my sober life. My thoughts are more clear and I’m starting to develop better relationships with people, my girlfriend and family. I’ve lost some friends along the way but that’s because they can’t escape this deadly disease... i really hope they do. I see the best person in them when their sober but it’s hard to explain that to them.

What was hard for me early in sobriety was weekends. Finding things to occupy my time on a Friday or Saturday night was mentally exhausting, it caused a lot of anxiety and boredom. A big help was nature. Instead of getting exciting for late nights at the pub i started getting excited for early morning walks in the trails with my dog and girlfriend, throwing my head phones in and listening to a joe Rogan podcast. It helps doing a personal inventory of yourself.. owning your thoughts and regrets. 

I always felt embarrassed and shameful when i started telling people i don’t drink. It can be annoying living in a culture where drinking makes you a “man” or “cool”. Going against the grain makes you an enemy.. but I’m starting to love owning it. Definetly starting to feeel more grateful for the ones i love and the things that matter most to me. This sub helps keep me humble and remember who i am and what i once was and how I’m becoming a wayyy better person.

My drinking career is over.. i had a lot of ups and downs but i just don’t got it in me anymore. So now i tell people I’m retired from drinking. You can say it with a smirk on your face to let people know you don’t care what they think, i think it’s a good joke. Hopefully this helps, love ya ;)

First time posting here and I'm grateful for you taking the time to read my post. I've been under a heavy amount of work stress which has caused me to lose my hair, and made me very anxious and depressed. Last night I drank way too much with my BF and his parents, whom I adore. I am very petite and didn't realize how much I had drank until it all caught up with me. I got upset when they said I shouldn't drive (I took a Lyft because they were right). Today I am filled with so much self hate and I am disgusted looking at my reflection in the mirror. I said hurtful things, acted selfishly and irrational. My BF is a loving and amazing partner and he admitted he was hurt from the events of the evening but said he will always be by my side and will never give up on me. He also said his parents were hurt about how I acted. I want to be a better person, be the woman my BF deserves, and express my deepest regret to his parents for my behavior. I don't know where to start and I'm hoping to get advice here, please. I am totally disgusted with myself and I want to hate myself less and have people see that I am a good person with a good heart and that I am so sorry for what I've done.

I’ve been on the same antidepressant in various doses for the past two years, and the same anxiety medicine. I started getting much worse about six months ago and started drinking every night nearly, and though my dosages have been increased twice since then, when I’m sober, the symptoms are almost unbearable.

The only thing I am managing to do successfully at this point is stay sober. I’m not eating, I have no interest in anything, I only sleep with plenty of OTC sleep meds, and I can’t find the motivation to do anything. 

I guess I’m going to AA tonight, mostly because it’s an hour where I won’t have the temptation of the cheap wine at the gas station across the street from my house, and I won’t be at home with my family and housemates, making everyone else miserable with my moodiness. I’m not really a believer in the program, per se, but it’s something to do, I guess.

It has gotten to the point where I would be classified as a heavy drinker. 

Last Friday I told myself that Monday would be day one. I allowed myself to have a few drinks during the Superbowl but I was not going to wake up with a Superbowl hangover. Which I didn't. 

I am ready for actual restful sleep. I am ready to wake up without headaches or stomach aches. I am ready to wake up not rushing to the coffee pot because I am so tired from the previous night.

Somewhere along the way I lost my ""when"" button.  I can't turn it off.   I am a very high functioning drunk.  get up and go to work everyday, don't have hangovers, no trouble with the law or any other effects like that.  I just drink to excess every day (weekdays after work, and all day on weekends).  The sad thing about this is, it wasn't until I was nearly 50 years old before I developed a drinking problem.  I was mostly a  light weight drinker before then. Drank rarely and if I did I would get tipsy and drunk very easily and be very sick the next day.

And then something changed. I became a frequent after work drinker that morphed into a out of control drinker. And now 10 years later here we are again.  I had almost 2000 days sober(Aug 2009 -Dec 2014), but threw it away thinking I could control my drinking. And since then, except for 2 periods of complete abstinence lasting about 4-6 months I drink every day and mostly to excess. There is no level of moderation that I can sustain. I drink everything in the house, or until its time to go to bed.  This latest spiral down started last June and has been a steady descent once again. It restarted with a couple of beers after work, and now its a 6 pack after work and 12 pack or more on Saturday and Sundays.  Even started drinking bourbon.  really bad idea.  

Don't even remember the Superbowl yesterday.  Started drinking at 930am yesterday because why not?  I have to accept that I will never be able to control this beast and I still don't know how I ended up here, but today I will not drink.  I don't know what else to do other than that.

Yesterday I went out of my way to cook dinner from scratch, and it felt really nice to get back in touch with one of those hobbies that was so easy to let go when I was drinking myself into a stupor every night. It was a nice feeling to be able to go to the grocery store and consciously avoid the wine aisle, knowing even a week ago I would have been loading up 2 or three bottles for the night. It feels like a big step in the right direction. Also, I cleaned up all of the dishes instead of leaving them to crowd the kitchen sink while I got cozy on the couch with a box of wine. I will admit my drying rack is full to the seams... but that's just life :-).

You know after a couple of days the rationalization has really started. We all adhere to the ""one day at a time"" philosophy but truth be told it scares the shit out of me to think that I'll be sober forever. This morning it's like there's a small voice at the back of my head saying ""In the future I can moderate."" I haven't struggled with alcohol as long as I struggled with weed (11 mos. clean), but as long as there's been a vice in my life, there's been no moderation. So I'm not stupid, but I'm definitely an addict and even entertaining that voice, not even listening, makes me feel weak.

This week I want to think long and hard about how and why I started drinking. Not a good sign that I've forgotten/suppressed a lot of that. Maybe I'll find some insight there so I can talk back to that voice by remembering the last time(s) I thought I could moderate. On some level, I've never really used alcohol in moderation. If I every used alcohol, the sole purpose was *not* to moderate. It was to numb everything. What am I even missing by passing up ""moderation""?

It’s so sad that today’s society glorifies alcohol and it revolves around our social gatherings, such as Super Bowl parties.  I did not drink this Super Bowl, so I was more aware of the drunkenness around me....quite sad to be honest.  There are such beautiful people in this world and I ask why do you need alcohol to “feel good” or “happy”.  The fact is that these passionate and loving people you see that are abusing alcohol are actually really hurting on the inside and they’re using it to cope with the problems of life. 

I feel that in today’s society a lot of people are too scared to cope and talk about their struggles. They want to appear as if everything in their life is fine! These people remind me of a bright red apple, but the inside of the apple is filled with black worms.  Therefore, some people result to getting absolutely drunk as a skunk to numb the pain. I used to be this person  - constantly abusing alcohol to numb my pain and now that I’m sober I feel the best I’ve ever felt in my life.  

Stay sober my friends and I encourage everyone to reach out to a loved one going through alcoholism and tell them that you love them and that you care about their well-being and health

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we share about AoK which have touched us this past week. It can be AoK to ourselves, to others, to animals, or to the environment we live in. It can be AoK which we've performed, received, observed, or heard about secondhand or through the media. Any AoK which has touched us is fair game.

My AoK to myself this week is that I’ve kept up with doing my recovery work. I’m working a lot of hours and I’m still on the steep part of the learning curve with my new job, and I’ve got other demands on my time with packing and getting ready to move and all of that good stuff.

It’s tempting when life gets busy to deprioritize my recovery, but I know that it’s the most important thing that I can do for myself. I have the life that I have now because I’m sober, and I know that I have to keep my sobriety in order to keep what I have. So I’m continuing to put time into my recovery work and I’m continuing to connect with people in my recovery network when and how I can. It’s an AoK to myself to say that my sobriety is important and worth prioritizing.

My AoK to someone else this week is I’ve been reaching out to a woman I know who’s struggling with her sobriety. I’m sharing honestly with her about my own experiences with relapse. It helped me a lot to let go of my shame and to get support when other people shared with me what their drinking had been like and what it was like when they got sober. It also helped me to know that other people noticed me and cared about how I was doing. 

So I’m trying to repay the favor. I can’t get anyone else sober, but I can offer support. And it feels good. Helping her helps me feel good about myself and where my life is now. It feels good to be able to offer hope, because I know what it’s like to feel hopeless. It feels good to be an example of someone who got out of the trap of active addiction. 

I’m sober now, and I don’t struggle to stay sober, and there was a time when I literally couldn’t pour enough alcohol down my throat to get as drunk as I needed to be, it physically wasn’t possible for me to drink fast enough or hard enough to feel okay. I have a different way of living now, and I don’t feel the need to drink today. It feels good to be able to share that with someone else, because I know how much it helped me when others shared with me.

Anyway, that’s where I’m at this week. How’s everyone else doing, any AoK that you’d like to share?",17

I am not a big football fan myself (and I worked last night) so I made it through the night without much temptation, but I know that was not the case for everyone.  If you caved and drank last night after a while with sobriety and you are reading this, then I am (and we are all) glad you are here back at it.  If you drank last night and today is the first day where you are reading through this page and you want to give it up, then please (if you feel comfortable) join us.  It gets better.  It really does.  I am only on Day 39, but trust me it gets better.  Slowly.  It is a difficult road at times, but it gets better.  It REALLY does.  So to everyone here either still sober, regaining sobriety, trying it for the first time, whether you are sick of all of the hungover Mondays or if last night made you rethink some things, I am glad you are here.  We are all glad you are here, and we are all rooting for you.  This is the way.  :) Thank You.",19

I allowed my libido to overrule my sober brain.

I enjoyed the company of the lady in question. I allowed my need for something physical to get the better of my sober success.

I let my mind play a stupid trick on me and I regret it. It was the start of a gradual return to drinking, which culminated in getting drunk during the past weekend.

I regret it immensely. I was kidding myself during the conversation with drinking buddies that it was all about finding a balance. I was convincing myself that it was all about finding the amount that was ok to consume alcohol.

I lied to myself. There is no OK level.

That little voice in mind, that deceitful and harmful voice had gotten out of its cage and back into the forefront of my thoughts.

Here I am. Looking back over the past few months and taking a long hard look at what I achieved before that fateful night.

This is a difficult journey at times.

I am on my third day without drinking.

Last night I almost cracked. The super bowl without beer.... is just not the Super Bowl to old me. We always gave people over and it’s byob because I’m gluten free and can’t drink other people’s beer, makes it easier.

People showed up with CASES of truly and white claw. I hate seltzer but it’s gluten free. I almost cracked and then I had the moment of I am not messing up two months of this for a fucking seltzer. So I made it. Got annoyed with everyone being loud and staying way too late but I made it. And considering the lack of sleep I’m thankful I don’t also have a hangover.

That said the foreverness is intimidating me. I went through a month or so where I didn’t really miss it, I was loving how much better I felt and the weight I lost.  It’s not that positivity has gone away, but I think I’m forgetting how bad I felt. How expensive it was. I keep thinking how good it would taste after this time.

I’m 14 months sober, former heavy/high-functioning drinker.  Sobriety has been an amazing journey and I am grateful for how much my life has changed for the better since I made the decision to quit.  

Throughout my journey, my husband has been attempting to quit and has gone through many relapses, including situations where our small children (3 and 6) were unattended (he would pass out at home when they had no other adults around) or in danger (he drove intoxicated with them).  My husband currently has about 50 days sober.  He went to in patient rehab in December after a particularly bad relapse where he tried to have our 6 year old blow into his BAC monitor when I realized something was up.  He told her to never tell anyone, including me.

The fallout has been enormous.  The pain caused by these incidents tremendous.  I feel so sad for my girls that they have had to be exposed to all of these frankly terrifying incidents.

I don’t really have a point to posting but I just wanted to put this out there.  How does one move on after this level of pain?  Can you ever learn to love and trust a spouse who has hurt your children, knowingly or unknowingly?  

I am so sad, lost, lonely.  I feel like a failure as a wife and a mother.  I feel like I didn’t do enough to protect my children and I feel like a vindictive shrew for not being able to get over these betrayals.

The good news is, I will not be drinking over this, today or in the future.

Also, I am in al-anon and also individual therapy so I do have help in this area.  I did just want to share with a group of people that may have direct experience in this area.

High functioning, newly retired 65 year old woman living in Australia.  I have been drinking heavily for the last twenty years; probably the last ten years I 'settled' in on a bottle of Chardonnay a night, with a little extra glass top up from the top up bottle.  Drank boxed wine for a good long while but actually that got right out of control as it was 'unmeasured' to me, so went back to bottles a year or so ago to help 'manage' it. 

Never day drink (unless a glass or two at lunch - rare), no hair of the dog, but after the evening meal I was all in, and would slam through that bottle+ in a couple of hours.  

Ran into this group and reading the posts has seriously gotten me thinking I can do it - I have all the symptoms: being overweight, the odd all day hangover, accusatory conversations with my husband, the odd 'accident' of running into a door jam or wall, with mysterious bruises the next day (how'd I do that?), seriously always needing to consider how much wine is in the cupboard and god forbid running out, a foggy head, a bloated face.

For instance, the whole idea that if you drink again, your sobriety you got is worthlss, and you “didnt get it.” They don’t count the decades of sobriety you have, if you drink its all back to zero. I’m not sure thats even true, let alone helpful. 

Also, the idea that we are “born alcoholics” And “my alcoholic thinking” and “I’m selfish and arrogant, thats why I’m drinking, Drinking is only a symptom” I don’t buy into this any more. I don’t think there are normal people that drink healthy because alcohol is a poison! You cant drink poison healthily! There does not seem to. Be a gene for alcohol, and even if there was, not drinking would not make you an alcoholic! You can only have problems with alcohol if you drink! Its alcohol thats the problem!

Sorry for my rant. Again I dont’ want to totally bash AA, but I am just thinking aloud. I dont’ like the all or nothing approach of AA. I think they could change that without hurting the good they do!",3

I feel very ill, mouth so dry but I can’t drink water, shaky hands, red irritated skin, heart palpitations, anxious and very upset. Cannot sleep properly.

Day 2: Even more dehydrated, can start to drink more fluids but my mouth still has a constant dryness. Can start to eat more normally, face starts getting very itchy and dry skin. Acid reflux makes eating difficult. Very low mood, very anxious.

Day 3: Mouth still constantly dry no matter how much fluid I drink. Begin binge eating (this continues for a few days). Feel so anxious that I’m out of breath, want to be alone.

I have drunk dreams every few months, and they usually follow this pattern: I decide to get drunk, regret it, then lie about it to maintain my reputation in the recovery community. Dream me is a liar. Awake me always fesses up, usually within a couple of days maximum. I've been sober for over two years, so no need to fess up for drinking at least.

I'm a volunteer on a phoneline where there is a minimum sobriety requirement of one year. I have a supervisory role there, which I value. I really don't want to lose that for momentary relief  of my emotional pain. (Major break up recently, doing lots of crying, having a few cravings a week for alcohol usually when at the supermarket.) 

My dream last night involved me getting drunk with others, regretting it really quickly, hoping that they wouldn't tell anyone. In my dream, I went to my phoneline job hungover, hoping I didn't smell of wine. It took me a couple of minutes on wakening to realise that I still have my sober time intact.

Sorry if it's long winded but I need people to talk with that aren't judgmental. I've been drinking heavily 7+beers, typically strong ipa's for around a year and a half, every single day.

Last Wednesday I got sick, the flu. I was bedridden for a few days and couldn't drink even though I did the day I felt marginally better. I didn't get drunk but wondered why the hell I did that. While I was healing I kind of liked the way I felt being sober. I was more focused and present especially while doing the thing I love most in this world, watching films.

While starting a movie with a beer was nice at first it leads to more and more beer. Which made staying focused for a film difficult and finishing one sometimes impossible. I always thought alcohol made films better but I couldn't even finish one. 

Since I've been sober, around three days, I've been devouring them. In particular two films stuck out to me that have motivated me to want to do and be better in my life. They were Click and Punch-Drunk Love.

Hear me out, I know they are Adam Sandler movies and he's kind of hated on but I love him with a passion. I recommend everyone here see Click. It deals with a family man consumed by work who is able to fast forward, stop, rewind his life to suit his needs. His loving family begs him to spend more time and prioritize them but he chooses work and eventually alienates everyone and fast forwards his life until he is miserable and alone. 

For me this spoke to what I was doing in my own life. Drinking everyday was like fast forwarding while at the same time not being there, operating on autopilot. No goals, not pushing myself to do what I need to get a better life. It made me very emotional even though it's cheesy. It made me look at what's most important in life, the people that I love.

The other film Punch-Drunk Love, is a beautiful love story about a broken man that despite his flaws finds someone that loves him. This film spoke to me immensely. As someone who's been single and hasn't been on a date in over a year, I have certainly seen myself much like the character in the film as unloveable, drinking amplified this a thousand fold. I want to be in love again but I have realized it's not possible while drinking especially because while drinking I don't love myself. It won't be until I do love myself that someone else will too.

If you read this thanks. I'm sorry for writing a wall of text but I needed to put this out there. From this cinephile to you, IWNDWYT.",5

Fearful of having to admit that I am an alcoholic, not just someone with a “drinking problem” 

The people were welcoming and so friendly, I didn’t have the courage to share but I listened intently to the stories. Some were heartbreaking and harrowing, making me feel like maybe my drinking wasn’t really that bad, questioning whether I really was addicted to alcohol?? 
Like, I don’t drink every day or before work, so do I really have that much of a problem?
I started thinking...”it’s not like I’m homeless or have been arrested or lost my job or kids”...

And then I stopped....and realised how judgemental I was being 😔

If I just added the word “yet” to anyone if those scenarios, that could very well be my reality if I don’t stop drinking now.

I’m not homeless...yet
I’ve not been arrested...yet
I’ve not lost my home or family...yet

And I never want these things to happen. Drinking is a slippery slope. 

It’s probably only through sheer dumb luck that none of those things have happened to me but I have done so pretty reckless and shameful things drinking, and I am so grateful for having a loving partner who is supporting me through this.

I am also grateful to my newfound friends in this sub and at AA, thank you all for the support,

There's no perfect opportunity around the next corner, hot blonde loaded down with money waiting at the bar, or a golden ticket inside the wrapper of your next candy bar. There's not a perfect girl in the meeting who's just waiting to talk to you or a friend in the making who will come in and rescue you from your loneliness and self - persecution. No winning lottery ticket blowing in the breeze or rich uncle about to kick the bucket.

Your ex - wife will not come running back into your arms to confess all of her mistakes and her undying love for you. The bank will not give you back the house you built and those jobs you've lost aren't waiting for you to come back.

The universe will not pay you back for the years of torment and self - martyrdom you've suffered simply because you WANT it to. In fact, no one in the world can or will give you that time back simply because that's what you FEEL like you deserve. The universe does not care about your feelings, nor should it.

You've spent your life in fear of failure and in the end you still failed in everything that truly mattered. You died, Chris. On October 31st, 2013 - when you're failure finally became apparent - you stopped living. Though you've continued to draw breath these past 7 years you were not truly alive.

But with breath comes hope, and with that hope there comes a renewed sense of purpose. All you need to do is reach out and grab it. Hold onto it with all your strength because that hope and that purpose may very well be the only thing left that can bring you back to life.

STOP waiting for someone to save you - no one is coming - and STOP continuing in this life without living. You very well know the grass was not greener back then and that you do, in fact, have a choice to raise yourself back up into the world once again. You have so many talents and gifts to contribute that have been wasted while stuck in your self - made slice of purgatory.

Now you know. Today you've given voice and order to the imprisonment of your own thoughts and THIS will set you free. Through the very hope that comes with your breath and the grace of God you may now move forward. Not only to live again, but to live well. 

Chris, today I love you and know that the time has finally come. 

With God's help, today I will start living again. With God's help, today I will cast aside my bonds and turn miracle into routine.

God, thank you for keeping me here long enough to work this out and be with me today - so that I may move forward carrying out your will and not my own.",7

I often wondered if she rolled her eyes every time she heard it (she didn’t). And I meant it every time! It really did feel different. But of course, for one reason or another, that time wasn’t to be my final attempt at sobriety. 

When I said it again on the 26th of December 2019, I also meant it. 

But here’s the thing: every time HAS been different. My failed attempts haven’t happened in isolation; they’ve each had a cumulative effect on the next one. I’ve learned from my mistakes. My last attempt? Failed because I couldn’t truly imagine a forever without drinking. This time I’m starting to, and that’s what makes this attempt different from the last. 

Is this the one? I don’t know, but it feels different this time. And I’m hopeful.

There was never a time where alcohol was not stocked in our fridge. There were a lot of late nights were I couldn't sleep due to his loud music and laughter. Sometimes my parents would end up fighting over it. They were even separated for a few years during my teens but he eventually came back.

My first drink was with my father on new years when I was 17. Up until I was 21 I would only drink at parties, holidays, birthdays, etc. Recently I lost both my grandparents (on my dads side) within the span of one year and started drinking a lot with my dad to cope with our loss. I was drinking so often this past year it kind of all seems like a blur. Just this past month there were only a handful of days were I was sober. Last night I blacked out and apparently had a really bad fight with my sister. I don't remember any of it. She told me about it when I woke up and I just felt this immense shame and guilt. My mother is not proud of the state our family has been in lately. She even compared me to my dad and fears I'll be an alcoholic just like him. Those words stabbed into me cause I know the stress his drinking put on our family growing up.

I'm 22 now and I need to get a grip and just stop drinking all together or at the very least cut it down to just celebratory times again. I know it's not going to be easy but I'm proud to say I'm 1 day sober. I still have alcohol from last night but I might just get rid of it. I didn't have an urge to drink today because of how hungover and ashamed I am but I fear if I don't get it out of the house I'll want to drink it myself.

Drinking is sort of a part of the work culture here. I am constantly offered beer and asked if I wanna go out and party. People always make fun of me, saying I need to live a little, enjoy life, etc. because I’m not drinking. 

Then they go get hammered and the stories I hear the next day are so cringe and I’m just reminded how much better I sleep knowing I didn’t do something dumb. Or wake up with anxiety remembering I sent a bunch of inappropriate text messages to someone. Anyone else not miss that feeling of looking at your phone hungover the next morning as embarrassment overcomes you because you sent tons of texts to your ex? Or told someone “how you really feel”?

The other weekend two of the guys were screaming at each other at like 3 in the morning, waking up the whole house. This weekend, everyone went out to a bar and one guy got kicked out for harassing the band and making lewd comments to a girl. Another guy passed out at the bar and then puked in the front yard when he got home. Then yet another guy was telling me he sent a novel of embarrassing texts to his friend he has a crush on while he drank alone in his room. 

Every weekend I get woken up by these guys drinking and they just don’t give a shit that they are being so loud. I’m so glad I’m not that inconsiderate person anymore.  

Stuff like this happens all the time and I’m like “guys don’t you see how drinking is obviously not making your lives better? You are literally living examples of why I don’t drink.” Then they still give me shit for being lame or whatever and try and pressure me to drink.

Now to the business at hand: I had always considered myself a high-functioning alcoholic. I have a stable job, a fiancee, and a loving family who -I thought- had no idea that I downed a bottle of whatever-I-could-find on a daily basis. When I quit I thought that having the support of my family would be nice, but I couldn't find it in me to shatter the image they had of me. So I shouldered it on myself.

Fast forward to today's morning. I'm out of city on work business, and I got a text from my neighbor saying that there was water leaking through my front door. My parents live in the same city as me, and they have a key to my house, so I texted my father to see if he could go and check what was going on. Turns out a pipe burst in the kitchen out of nowhere. My dad fixed it and that was it.
That was morning, he let me know what happened and how he fixed. That was it. But about an hour ago he sent me another text (paraphrasing, since english is not our first language):

""There weren't any beer cans or tequila bottles in your house,everything was clean and it didn't smell of tobacco anywhere. Since Christmas you look healthier than ever. I'm so proud of you, son. Your mother and I will always be here for you, don't forget that.""

I cried in my hotel room like a baby.

I don't know exactly why I wanted to make a post about this. I guess I just wanted to unwind. I'm taking my folks to dinner and let them know everything as soon as I get back in town. 
Stay healthy, friends. This is the way; there's not another one. I'm here for you. I will not drink with you today.",208

I’m 21 in my last semester at college. drinking is a pretty regular part of my life and the life of my friends but i feel like i always take it too far. short version is i either fall asleep in the middle of a room or end up crying and needing consoling in a way that would be okay if it was one time, but definitely is not when it’s often. 

history: my mom (48F) has BPD and a severe history of abuse from family and partners. she has been verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive to me growing up and i mostly cut ties w her about 6 months ago.  i have a lot of trauma, not exclusively associated w my mom but i have issues.  

when i drink i usually drink more than everybody else. when i drink i get sad but i project deep feelings into v small social situations and blow them out of proportion.  when i drink i embarrass my friends and my 2 year bf. when i drink i like halfway ruin the night ? not a fighter or a screamer but for those who are close to me who i’m usually w) i make their night much harder.

also, the following is something that actually nobody else knows unless they’ve guessed which, maybe they have. idk why but no matter how drunk i am towards the very end of the night i take like 2-4 extra shots. i won’t be awake for them to fully hit or ‘enjoy’ them, but for some reason i feel like i have to do them. 

i don’t want to have to stop drinking, that fucking sucks i’m 21 and am about to move to a big city. i feel lost and feel like i can’t talk to therapist, SO, any friends, or family ab this while being fully honest.  That’s also while having extremely close basically full disclosure relationships in all areas of my life except for this. i am also v scared of not drinking.

But there was one point where I had mentioned that I was thinking about getting a vasectomy. (due to my uncertainty with the future) and in that exchange she said something that really hit home that I never had considered. Part of the reason she never wanted anymore children after my daughter was because of where I was headed with my drinking... that was a big reality check for me. It tells me that things were bad for a lot longer than I thought. By that I mean probably ten years. How could I have been so blind...... of course it was the right decision on her part and as I reflect back it must have taken diamond hard resolve as I had always expressed my desire to have 2 children. At this age and stage of my life, under any circumstances another child would not be something I would want. But she mentioned, and I see now that making rash decisions about my reproductive future when I’m in this place is probably not the best idea and in reality isn’t something that should be a priority. 

Either way that admission was a pretty big revelation and I find myself looking further back at how this descent to where I am now started a lot longer ago than I realized or was ready to admit maybe. I wonder if others saw the pattern like she did..... lots to think about.",2

Checking in with yinz to share that I’ve recently celebrated 2 full years being booze free! My anniversary was actually January 28th, but I’ve been a bit busy living my life and doing my thing, so I didn’t get a chance to post last week.

I really can’t believe it’s been so long since I quit. The last night I drank, I had been bar hopping alone on a Saturday night in my neighborhood, as I was wont to do. I had dinner with a friend earlier in the evening and had some sake. She went home and I stayed out to drink more because I couldn't just have a couple sakes and leave it at that, now could I? I proceed to drink 6-8 high ABV craft beers at two other bars, then had two very strong vodka sodas at the last place I went to. I downed two vodka drinks in quick succession before the bartender had a chance to realize how drunk I was, then  stumbled out of the bar and made my way home literally falling down drunk. It was raining and I couldn’t walk straight. I fell a few times in the mud, tore up my jeans and got filthy. I was literally crawling in a muddy puddle at one point. When I made it home, I sat on the stoop for a bit and thought about just passing out there for the night. But I made it inside somehow, fell asleep in my bed, and managed to stay alive until the next morning where I proceeded to puke my guts out all day and said for the millionth time that I was never drinking again.

And well, it really stuck that time, because I haven’t had a drink since. That was actually my 4th or so serious attempt to quit in about as many months. I had really been trying hard before that, but every few weeks I’d get a case of the ""fuck its"" and drink again. The falling down drunk, though, and knowing that I really could have hurt myself and put myself in a really dangerous situation … well, I guess that was a wake up call for me that I really, definitely, no shit needed to quit or I was literally going to die. (It's all on my post history, if you're interested.)

Things are looking much different for me these days. The days of white-knuckling it thru Friday and Saturday nights are over. Not drinking has been the normal for a long time. This weekend I hung out by myself, hung out with my boyfriend and his mom, did volunteer work, and went to the gym all without the assistance of alcohol.

I’m in the best shape of myself thanks to being alcohol free. I’ve been doing Stronglifts and Couch to 5K, so I’m hitting the gym 3-5 times a week. In fact, I’ve been working out so consistently that a woman at the gym stopped me today to compliment me on my physique and asked if I was a dancer. That would have never happened if I was still drinking.

I’ve been seeing a great guy since the summer, and there’s no way I would have kept this relationship going if I was still drinking. I was honest with him when we started dating about why I quit, and he’s been very supportive and appreciative. Honestly, I found the whole “dating while not drinking” thing to be much less intimating than I thought it would be. I went out with a few guys before meeting my current beau, and they were all completely fine with me not drinking. In fact, they welcomed it. One guy didn’t drink at all; another one did drink but was cutting way down; and a couple other guys were “normal” drinkers and enjoyed hanging out with me without the pressure to drink on our dates.

I’ve also saved a ton of money. I have a full $10,000 sitting in various savings accounts thanks to being alcohol free, and that’s even with some big-ticket item purchases and a few vacations thrown into the mix. I was spending at least $500 a month on booze, and now all that money goes straight to savings. It’s been such a load off knowing that I have a cushion in case I need it. I’ve also been increasing my 401K contributions, which I’ve been getting a very robust return on. It’s so much better than literally pissing my money away.

Although I believe that the most important thing is that I’m not drinking, I am careful to say that I haven’t been completely sober. I have been using psychedelics occasionally, and I still use weed on a pretty regular basis. I’ve been learning a lot about how psychedelics can help with addiction, and I can say without a doubt that they have helped me as well. For me, I've never had an issue with weed or other drugs like I have with booze, so as long as I remain alcohol free, that's the most important thing for me, personally.

I hope this post helps someone out there who is struggling. I know it’s incredibly hard to imagine 2 years without booze when you can barely make it two hours or two days or two weeks or two months. But, I truly believe that you can do this. Recognize that it’s one day at a time, and start racking up those days. Hell, even minute by minute. Minutes add up to days, weeks, months, and years, and it truly does become easier and easier. You got this.

I found focusing on the moment and not looking to far ahead keeps me grounded. I’m not saying that it’s been all sunshine and lollipops but they say it gets easier and I’m slowly realizing that. 

I chose not to make grand statements about what I’m going to do because I can’t tell the future, and my past promises to myself and my loved ones proved to be hollow. This time everything has changed, more importantly I have changed; The way I see myself, learning how alcohol affected me physically and chemically. 

I can’t fix what is broken in 12 days but I’m dealing with one day at a time and reaching out regularly for support, something I never did in past attempts. I’m still lonely and sad for what I lost but I’m getting better little by little and that makes me happy.... ok, less sad 

Thank you for your support friends.

I have been a heavy drinker since high school and tought I had an addiction then. But for the last couple of months I have been drinking more again but not linking it with an addiction. About a few months ago I started having terrible stingy pains again around my stomach. The doctor told me I now also have an inflamed stomach and I must stop drinking alcohol or I would get an internal stomach bleeding in a few months. 

So I quit drinking because this was a huge reality check... This weekend I got some friends over and bought my first 0.0 beers. As I was drinking them it came natural to me to almost drink fast/chug them every time I drank. This for me was a great eye-opener to my addiction. My mind is so indoctrinated into drinking beer to make myself numb I even did it with the 0.0’s. This in combination with the confessions and tips I am reading here are really helping me. In a way this is a rip for you guys. If you crave alcohol try some 0.0’s it is almost a placebo for the real stuff.

I’m nervous sharing these. I can’t believe how I let myself get due to my drinking. All those extra calories and sugars... not to mention the water weight. 

I’m down 20lbs and I am feeling great. I still have some work to do but I know it will come if I just stay this course.

I'm not just saying that, I am completely genuine. You guys are great. 

Before I decided to make this significant lifestyle change, I had been a heavy drinker for about 8 years.  Usually I would down a 6 pack of beer each night, if not a bit more. Being away from alcohol and getting some distance between my drinking self, I have had a lot of time to reflect on how life was before and what it is becoming. 

My drinking never reached the point of the stereotypical alcoholic, as I'm sure it doesn't for most people who are addicted. I was never unemployed during those 8 years, I was never homeless, I never lost my friends or family. Instead, the problems caused by drinking were much more insidious. Sure, there were the physical effects, like being a bit overweight, waking up with hangovers, craving alcohol, etc. However, the mental effects were much harder to understand until I got away from drinking. I felt depression and anxiety, which slowly creeped up on me until it felt ""normal"" and with that came a sense of purposelessness. My life felt like it had no direction. I had no goals and no motivation. My sense of who things were going to be tomorrow, or next week, or next year was entirely stagnant. There was a time in my teens and 20's where I had achieved a lot but I felt those days were long gone. 

There were things that I wanted, sure, but getting them seemed impossible. I wanted to lose a few pounds and get into shape but actually doing it, too difficult. I wanted to get my finances in order, finally start paying off debt, buy a house, feel secure in the future but it seemed too daunting, so I didn't try. Positive change seemed impossible and my energy to move on to the next phase in life was non-existent. All the problems stayed the same and each day was exactly the same as the last. 

That aspect of alcoholism was one that in retrospect was the most painful but also the most difficult to recognize. I'm just now starting to see that recovering from drinking is not just getting over the withdrawals. Instead there is a long period of reflection, healing, and growth that goes along with it. I'm happy to report that feeling my life had no meaning or direction is gone. I've cleaned up my diet and have lost about 17 pounds so far in 2020. I've made huge progress in cleaning up my finances. Things are going great at work and overall my life feels completely different than it did when I was drinking. 

I know there are still challenges ahead but I'm excited to see where sobriety takes me.",6

We're all in our late 20s / early 30s, young professionals, some who are married with kids. These are all breaks that normally involve drinking all day, sometimes pot / weed vape etc. We usually go hard.

I'm planning on not drinking or smoking, but am worried people will either try and pressure me into drinking, or I'll not have fun. My body clock is now so different to theirs - I'm up early doors and active and ready for bed at 10pm... Anybody got some positive stories of similar situations that went well when they expected the worst??

I was out last night for a friend's birthday and nobody I knew or strangers batted an eyelid at me not drinking - I'm naturally a big character, gregarious but lovable (I think), and yesterday having fun gives me a glimmer of hope, but folks, please do your thang and make me feel like I can do anything!!

I'd had my eye on Feb. 1 for a few days, and when the morning finally came, I knew I what I had to do. The only thing that got me out of bed, head throbbing, was the classic Midwestern tornado siren drill at 12pm sharp; after a shower, I ran off to the library to bury my face in work for 4 hours. There were so many times that afternoon that the thoughts crossed my mind: W*hy am I even worrying about this? Do I really need to quit? I'm just going to fail anyway. My drinking problem isn't even that bad.* First of all I have to thank everyone who commented on my post yesterday, because reading them throughout the day was very encouraging. 

The truth is that I ran away from my apartment yesterday because I knew that once I got home I had to face the reality of my problem and take measures to really cement this goal. It was one thing to tell the internet that I was quitting, it was another step entirely to pour out the wine in my fridge and pick up the pieces my habit had scattered across my home. 

I remember thinking all day: *My drinking problem isn't even that bad.* 

Well reader, with a hefty bag in hand, I threw away 10 empty bottles of wine and 7 boxes scatted across my kitchen, bedroom floor, and nightstand. Weirdly, the most gut-wrenching part of it all was picking up the little circular cardboard tabs that you punch out of a wine box when you open it-- they're fucking everywhere; under a couch in the living room, under my bed, in my kitchen swept under my fridge. I can count all the bottles and boxes and explain them all away, but nothing makes me realize that I have a problem a 1,000 little poker chips racking up the debt, gathering dust out of sight in every corner of my world.

That was yesterday, and while I didn't sleep well, I'm still sober and it's a new day. I've spent the morning cleaning my kitchen, washing all of the dishes that were so easy to ignore while I drunk away all of the weeknights after work for the past two weeks. I can't count the number of times I spent a Sunday afternoon purging the wine bottles, cleaning my kitchen spotless, and plopping down on the couch to with full bottle of denial that I had a problem in the world, because at least my apartment was clean. So this time I'm taking it slow-- one day at a time. A little cleaner, a little brighter, every day. Maybe someday soon I'll pick up the last cardboard pop-out tab gathering dust under an end table and chuckle? Wish me luck.",3

Sexual assault, having my belongings stolen while I was passed out, among a few other bad things led me to quit drinking in excess before it became a habit. Now I drink very little and only in social settings and I’m able to drink in moderation (1 to 2 at the most). Currently I’m completely sober as I’m pregnant.

The issue here is my best friend, well, now she no longer is. I’ve been knowing her heavy dependency on alcohol (especially wine) and I never wanted to bring it up to her because I knew it would be the end of our friendship. But after witnessing her get really angry at me for not letting her drive home drunk, blacking out at a party I had (where everyone was drinking very minimally or some not at all) and becoming aggressive and hitting my sister, among lots of other bad events, I decided to bring up her alcoholism to her. I brought it up very lovingly and as least judgmental as I could and I expressed how much I care about her and how I am here for her if she wants to talk. 

She decided to cut me off completely. She said “I don’t have any problem with alcohol” (but she drinks an entire bottle of wine at night) and she has refused to speak to me. I’ve tried to reach out to her boyfriend so I could pass by in person and try to make amends but they both are ignoring me. Her boyfriend knows she has a drinking problem because he’s confessed it to me before but he won’t tell her anything and enables her bad behavior. He even encourages her to attend wine events because that makes her happy.

I’m pretty bummed out that my best friend won’t be part of my pregnancy and I’m sad to lose her. It’s so eye opening to realize that an alcoholic is able to be friends with people that have been awful to them but they refuse to be friends with people that don’t drink or that push them to quit drinking.

2- So I can actually be productive after the show. I started a new craft project yesterday and I would like to pick up additional supplies for it and continue it this evening

3- I promised a friend I would call him this weekend. I don't want to call him drunk or postpone it because I'm drunk

4- I'm the closest to my ideal weight I've been since summer due to the calorie savings from not drinking and binge eating after drinking

5- During this month I met a guy I'm really into. And the feeling appears to be mutual. I met him sober, and he likes sober me. If I start drinking again today, it probably won't be long before I'm drinking everyday. Which will definitely change the relationship dynamic.

6- I want to get a good night's sleep tonight so I can be refreshed for work tomorrow

When I look back at the number of things I have accomplished over this month- the amount of hours that have not been spent drunk or passed out, the number of people with whom I've reconnected because I'm not avoiding the phone, the strides I've made with exercise & diet, the number of improvements I've made in my living space that I'd been putting off, how clear-headed I am and how much faster my brain processes things...I really can't throw all of that away for a little bit of oblivion.

Thanks for letting me say this out loud to try and hold myself accountable. I'm leaving in about 5 minutes... Wish me luck! IWNDWYT!",1

I’ve thought of how to hide it, lies to tell, and excuses to make. The more these plans,excuses,and justifications evolve the more I struggle to resist a drink. I wish I could just make my mind shut the fuck up. I’m tired of waking up craving a drink. 

I’m also tired of the social isolation that has come with sobriety. I went to an event with alcohol last night to help a friend with a booth. I was free to go off and watch the bands, but I sat at the table the entire time because I couldn’t stand seeing the bar or all the people walking around with drinks. I’m about to have to decline an invite to a friend’s bar hopping birthday party, and I had to turn down going to the bar with a friend before he starts his new job. All my socialization involved alcohol and I don’t know what to do now. I feel so lonely. I’ve been laying in bed for 3 hours, I can’t force myself up. I just want a drink. Sobriety is starting to feel worse than just drinking. I want to just go on a bender and pretend none of this ever happened. 

I have a sponsor, but I’m too much of a damn fool to ask for help. Some guys from AA that have been helping me a lot were urging me to reach out if I needed to, they know I’m struggling, they are there for me, but I still can’t bring myself to send that “I’m struggling today” text. Vulrability got me hurt in the past, I don’t know how to come back from that.",1

My sister and I went to a play last night. She did Dry January as well, so we had a glass of wine before leaving the house and a glass of wine at the play. It was okay. Nothing great. 

I started to remember the fuzzy, foggy feeling that comes with a bit too much alcohol. And I know exactly what it feels like to have a clear mind, be sharp, have energy to want to do things. I prefer to be sober. I never thought I’d say that. I can drink if I want. We have tons of alcohol in our bar in the basement. But I will choose to stick with water, sparkling water, and tea.

Edit - I have always struggled with insomnia, nighttime anxiety and restlessness and used alcohol for that

He enjoys bourbon like me, so I asked if he would like the bottles I still have, as I was gonna keep this dry January thing going as long as I could. He said thanks but no thanks, he had decided that he too was gonna cut back on drinking and would rather not have them.

2 years ago I woke up from a moderate (by my standards at the time) evening of drinking. My intestines were in knots, I'd soaked through my clothes and sheets, and I was certain I'd pissed the bed. I hadn't. Why was I in such bad shape after barely drinking the night before? I still don't have an answer to that. But about an hour after I woke up, while guzzling iced coffee, I decided I was done. 

I'd been drinking heavily for over a decade and I really ramped it up a few years prior due to a divorce. 3 years of my life were effectively gone because I was blacking out every night. Thankfully my career didn't suffer (I have no idea how I didn't destroy my professional reputation) but EVERY other aspect of my life was in shambles. I was fat, depressed, out of shape, unhealthy, lazy, isolated, miserable, angry, anxious, etc. So I quit.

I downloaded myfitnesspal, started counting calories, learned to meditate (still learning), stopped klonopin, started therapy (again), went for a daily walk, and was fucking miserable. Obviously it got better over time. It was sheer determination that got me through it. I don't have a support system. No understanding family, no friends, and after trying a few AA meetings realized that wasn't for me. I also didn't utilize this astounding community enough either. I lurked looking for inspiration, and I found it every day. One morning I was overcome with cravings and posted here not expecting to get any responses. Instead I received several, and within a few minutes of posting. That saved me. Thank you to all.

Things have gotten better in every way. I lost 90lbs, run 5-6 days a week, still talk to a therapist weekly, and am almost happy. There are still some underlying problems but every negative emotion and physical sensation has improved in the last 2 years. 

Here's to many more. I love each and every one of you.",20

""When I find myself awake
I'll put my thoughts down on a page
Half-asleep I'll make a list
Then read back all my greatest hits:
- Should meditate
- Should work out more
- Should read until my brain gets sore
- Meet someone
- Go far away
- Try being socially less strange

That's how a diamond grows
You give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker
I cut at least half of my friends
But no one noticed or mentioned
I thought at last I'd breathe easy
But then I've thought a lot of things
Hey New Year, Hey New You
You left so much low-hanging fruit
In the ring
A title fight
With only montage training time
That's how a diamond grows
You give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker
That's how a diamond grows
You reach as far as you can and hold tight
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different
They say a diamond grows with time
I believe it
Cause I've seen it with my eyes
There's a guaranteed parade
Of broken promises
If you expect some kind of miracle
You do what you can do
That's all (all, all)
That's how a diamond grows
You give yourself the right chance over time
Don't believe them if they try to sell you something quicker
That's how a diamond grows
With time
Don't believe them if they try to tell you something different""",2

I quit drinking because I don’t have enough time to waste so much of it recovering from drinking. Like this morning, for instance. My cousins arrive at nine. I woke up at 6:30, late for me. In the 2 ½ hours between, I have to empty the dishwasher, do at least a little stretching for my aging, aching body, shower, go to the bagel store, go to the regular store, stop by my daughter’s house to pick up the salmon, and, most important to me right now, write this journal entry and post it.  This is not an unusual day. If I were hung over, and I’m sure I would be if I hadn’t quit drinking, I would be groggy and depressed. And resenting every “have to” on a Sunday morning, my only free day. I would sit at the computer playing solitaire until the absolute last minute and would only accomplish the shower before leaving the house. By contrast, today I am tired but clear minded. I have broken the morning solitaire routine by writing instead (and I am really liking this). I’m looking forward to the stop at my daughter’s, not planning to just buy more salmon at the store so I can get in one more game. I can’t slow down the pace of my life, but I can create more space in it by changing this one thing. Skip the drinking.

Tomorrow will begin the bigger challenge. The work week. I can usually get through these first few days, have done it many times before. It’s the after work happy hour habit that holds the most power over me, when I blindly reach for a drink to combat exhaustion and anxiety and to find false energy for the evening tasks. As the week progresses, the urge to drink grows. I will have to be strong, and create a strict new routine. I will ponder that routine today. That is my homework, and it is due by bedtime.",12

What is wrong with me?,"Last night I attended a friend's band's EP launch and I imbibed more than I should have. Here is the conundrum though - On the one hand I didn't really want to go (because of the temptation to drink was massive - obviously), and on the other, I made a promise that I'd support friends who have supported me over the last few years; so eventually I decided that I would go and _try_ to temper myself. 

A great night turned into a sour one down the line and I didn't enjoy the evening. By this time my gf asked me not to have any more but I did regardless and it turned into a fight when I got home, to which I eventually passed out, issue unresolved.

I am just so tired of resetting weekly. I'm loathing myself and I think I'll do something productive like clean my apartment (which I have found I actually enjoy doing).

I just wanted to get this off my chest. 😔

It's not even close to the hardest thing I've ever done. People are congratulating me, and honestly it feels undeserved"".


Then a week after I passed 2 months of sobriety, it all hit. Me, alone, to my thoughts, and not a damn thing would get my head still. I have a million hobbies, and each one seemed more stupid and intolerable than the last. Every show on Netflix sounded like a waste of money. Going for a walk felt impossible. For the first time I had to text up a friend who is around a year and a half sober. We went out for coffee and cake at a local shitty diner, he paid, and we just talked.


Holy fuck you guys, seeing him not drinking, and having him tell me he remembers everything I was talking about, it helped so much. I'm a guy that tries to do everything alone, and I'm here to say don't. If you have the means, reach out. I can't thank this dude enough. You are not alone. Find a group. Find friends. Find anyone at all to talk to when you need. Don't be afraid of being turned down, or told your just being a little bitch. Anyone who's gone through this won't judge. We have all been there. This is a rough time for me, life just been a bitch, but I'll get through it, and I look forward to telling him it's been a year for me someday.

He has a high end condo and about 90 minutes ago his roommate and a few others walked into the kitchen. I got up get a drink. Walked into bottles, a bong, and a plateful of cocaine.

All of them were being super sociable. They kept repeatedly asking me to take a drink. One of them assured me if I was worried about the cost of the coke, it was on him. Finally after around the 8th offer I came clean about being in recovery.

The good news is I got a round of apologies and congratulations. No one offered me anything again. I didn't want to withdraw so I stayed and talked with them. 

After everyone but the roommate left, he apologized again. (My rehab roommate slept through this whole thing). I told him no worries. He just went to bed.

I did it but I am physically shaking now. I wanted that drink. All my sober contacts and sponsor didnt pick up when I called. And I've never done coke but today seemed the time to try but I was terrified how my brain would process it.

A change in perspective,"I have a friend I have known for around two years who I initially felt rather conflicted about and met after becoming sober. Their personality was great, but many of their social activities involved going to parties, getting quite drunk, and waking up the next morning not knowing exactly what happened the previous night. And I would go to these parties and remind them the next morning of what those things were if they asked. For a while, I thought they were a threat to my sobriety because being around them risked ""normalizing binge drinking"" in my mind.

But recently, I had a change of perspective. What's actually dangerous are my family and friends who can have 2-3 drinks, get slightly friendlier, and then go on about their days like alcohol is no big deal. Normalizing that is scary. That's the fantasy *my particular brand* of alcoholism and many tv commercials try to sell me. Getting blackout drunk and puking on your N64 has no possibility of becoming ""normal"" in my mind, it's the more subtle drinking that's really dangerous to me.

That friend is now one of my best friends, and they are a frequent example and reminder of the dark side of drinking. I don't know if they think they have a problem or not, but I'll be there for them if they decide they do. Thank you to my heavy drinking friend for keeping the risks and consequences fresh in my mind. Not sure if anybody finds this interesting or useful, just thought I'd share. Much love to all of you and I hope you are being kind to yourselves today <3. Choo choo!",13

Mobile, bad formatting, etc. I've been meaning to make a post for a while, and I'm still not sure what to say in it. I thought today was 40 days, but 42 feels like the perfect chance(it is the ultimate answer, anyways...) I was a massive problem drinker. I've had friends push me to sobriety for years. I ended up hospitalized ~44 days ago with a bac of .357, and I remember thinking that it wasnt even my top 5 drunkest nights that week. I ended up on the streets in an unknown city 53 miles from home with no friends nearby and no money for a taxi. My best friend sent me $150 for a taxi and told me he loved me but it was our friendship or the drugs and alcohol.

I chose the friendship. Here I am. I have a new job, and I might actually be able to hold it for longer than 3 months! Something I haven't managed in years. I'm looking to start dating again after 3 years of loneliness and drinking too damn much. I'm already losing a lot of weight. Looking and feeling the healthiest I've been in 5-6 years. It took me only a month to find a new job and pay that friend back with interest.

I still miss drinking casually, but I'll never miss binge drinking. There were plenty of times I could stop at 2 beers after work before going home and going to sleep. Just as often I could throw back a liter of the cheapest vodka in a 4 hour period. Waking up in the middle of the night shaking, freezing cold, just to drink 10-15 shots and hopefully sleep another 5 hours before rinse and repeat.

I plan to stay sober the entire rest of my life. I'm only 23 and I'm grateful I've stopped this early. I hate AA meetings, and this subreddit alongside my friends have been all I've needed to remind myself to keep to it. Cheers to all my fellow sober redditors out there, and cheers to anyone thinking about sobriety. It's worth it. 

It takes a long time to feel the benefits. My first week was nothing but stomach pain and sleepless nights of anxiety. Week 2 and 3? Still not sleeping, but at least I was eating. 42 days in and I just started sleeping normally again a few nights back. I never want to live through that mess again.

I will not drink with you today, or any day for that matter.

Like many of you, I've tried to moderate my drinking. I've tried to have just one glass of wine but it's impossible. So I've had to make a change.

My friendship group are very heavy drinkers, every weekend is a bender for them. I feel sad that I'll no longer be accepted by many of them. I feel sad knowing they will put social pressure on me instead of encouraging and supporting my choices.

I’m 28 now. I’ve tried to quit so many times. Last year I quit for 4 months but went back to it and it’s gotten so much worse. 

Lately I’ve had a series of great 6 day sober streaks and then fuck it up. I’m surrounded by alcohol. At work, all my friends, I’m single and lonely and I just keep giving in because I love being social, and I like to meet people and that’s where I do. But I have a problem and I very seriously need to stop. 

Any advice on actually sticking to my goals and not giving in would be amazing. I can see my health is starting to suffer. As of today I’m just exhausted from trying - is outpatient rehab a good call? 

When I drink I can put down 6 beers a night easy. When I go out and party hard I can do 15. I don’t drink during the day and I don’t have withdrawal when I quit. It runs in my family and I will admit to being an alcoholic, but I’m also aware it’s probably in the “problem drinking” stage. I’ve talked to my doctor and he didn’t seem concerned. And I just got a new therapist I’m seeing for the second time Tuesday. 

I have a great job, but stressful. I’m not going to lose my job by any means. They love me and I perform well. More and more I’m recognizing some real mental health issues I’m trying to address in therapy. It just seems like a massive undertaking to change my life so drastically but I need to. Do I need to just drop everyone I know and remove myself?

1) While drinking was a normal part of my life... I would sometimes know I had been drinking more than I should... so I would stop for a few days and see what life was like. This gave me a sense I could control it. I remember during some of those times.. the idea that life was just too easy without drinking and I was too good at it.. lol and I would start drinking again. 
2) I drank at exactly the wrong times even when life was going well or good things were coming up that I knew I would enjoy. I had the thought at those times I could just have this drink it will be okay and no one will know ... the perfect crime. It was total self sabotage and selfishness all at once. Couldn’t even let life go well. I ignored the reality that at the very least I would know. I thought different rules applied for me and ignored the impact a lack of honesty and moral values were having on me and those around me.
3) I used to avoid drinking just one. Even after my problem was being seen my partner would tell me I don’t mind if you have a beer or two of an evening. I never did. I thought what’s the point only having a few. So I just had none and resented not being able to drink... but it was my own choice. though knew I couldn’t drink the way I wanted to openly because I wanted to drink too much. I didn’t drink a few because I was too afraid of the cravings so I would try to drink in secret.

All of the above show the thoughts that on reflection are proof I am an alcoholic. Even though I didn’t realise it fully at the time. I have to remember these and not lower my guard to thinking I can ever have alcohol. It’s a slippery slope.

I will be grateful the insanity and dishonesty are no longer how I am choosing to live. Whatever problems arise and whatever I feel. I will do whatever I do better without alcohol.  I will make decisions to live in a way I can be honest about.",10

I have drank every day for the past 8 months, enough to get drunk.

I think I view myself as a functioning alcoholic bc 95 percent of the time it is at night, out of sight of anyone, and it doesn't impede on my daily life directly, though it does affect so much of my life over time.

I started obtaining alcohol in less than legal ways, as an indirect way to put it, because I do not turn a legal age for a month. And my purchasing sources have started to question and be worried about my consumption.

I have no idea what to do. I am doing poorly in my university, and I am losing my god damn mind.

I don't know how to feel okay without a bottle and I do not know how to convince myself I have a problem.

Then slamming down the coffees to wake up, and chugging coffee stay awake during the day. Rinse and repeat. 

I guess I got so used to being dehydrated I forgot how it feels to be dehydrated vs hydrated.

I have been loving sobriety (IWNDWYT) but waking up some days almost feeling hungover. I felt great mentally but just massively sluggish, and then almost asleep in the afternoon. I couldn’t help but ask myself, “where is all this energy people talk about, this sucks”.

I started tracking water intake and drinking the recommended amount. It’s a boat load of water by the way. What a difference it makes! The days I felt the worst were almost always preceded by low water intake.

If you are struggling with fatigue as you are on this journey try tracking your water intake. There are apps for this and fancy water bottles if you are into gadgets. 

It’s quite a discovery when you realize that the secret sauce to feeling better might be the one pouring out of your faucet.",108

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi,everyone! I'm happy to host the DCI again- it's one my favorite ways to give back to our community. I've had a very busy day of baking.

I drank too much (again) and fell in the bathroom and my head slammed into the toilet and gave myself a concussion. My husband came to help me and I was in the bathtub with all my clothes on taking a bath and yelling at him that I wasn't that drunk. That was my rock bottom. People have died doing less stupid things. The disappointment in my husbands eyes was too much, we've been together 10 years and he knew I had a problem but I think he always hoped I'd stop on my own. But that day I saw in his eyes that he was so sad, like maybe he married the wrong girl, maybe I'll never be good enough to be a mom, maybe he made a mistake.The thought of my husband and my dog having to see and deal with my dead body was too much for me to handle.
  Leading up to this was years of binge drinking, with intermittent day drinking and hiding it from everyone (I think) I drank before work, I drank at work and I would always lie about it to everyone. I was so depressed, and now that I'm sober I see that drinking was so obviously causing my depression, but I thought at the time it would help me.
  So my summer time waitressing job ended and I told everyone I wasn't going back, I can't work anywhere where alcohol is sold, I'm not strong enough right now. I applied to other jobs and within the week got a job at a gym at the front desk. My husband already was going to a gym but now I had a free membership so we started going to mine 5 days a week. I started drinking more water, and devoted my energy to getting healthy. I feel like I want to run away from who I was.
  My other job is a tattoo artist, and being completely sober has made me so much more focused and my artwork is improving so much, I never drank on days I tattooed but it's still all connected.
  I am taking a year of self help and solitude, my closest friends understand and support me, but I'm taking a break from being too social until I know I'm strong enough. In the meantime I'm just working and keeping myself constantly busy, so I'm not sitting alone and thinking about sneaking a bottle of wine before my husband gets home.
He's so proud of me and we're trying to have a baby.
I feel like I almost died,and I can't ever be that person again. I never knew I could be sober for this long and I never want to drink again. I've been looking at this group for a while, and I alot of what I've read has helped my on my journey. I will not drink tonight with you.",111

It was a white wine and hor d’oeuvres night with dozens of people in attendance. 

Initially, I was tempted to pour a glass or crack a beer. It had been a long couple of days, and I deserved it right? Instead, I started with a sparkling water (which I’ve never liked) instead of a popular IPA that I happen to “love”. I thought, if anyone thinks it’s weird, maybe I’ll switch to something else. To my surprise, not a soul questioned my choice. I had two more sparkling waters, and the night wore on as other candidates, students and faculty drank their fill of wine and beer. 

Everyone maintained, and there was no embarrassment due to over indulgence, although they all told tales of prior years about candidates that dashed their chances by getting sloppy. That would have been me, had I decided to drink. But I didn’t, and now I have what I feel is a solid chance at getting a position I’ve long sought after.

I'm nearing my 22nd birthday and the idea of going sober at this point in my life seems ridiculous to me but it is something I've been considering in the last year or so. 

I'm on a year long exchange atm in university, from the UK to the States. I had a conduct meeting yesterday about some aggressive behaviour from an event that happened around a month ago when I was drunk. I've got two more meetings lined up in the future, each about different events that have happened when I've been drunk. 

I'm a little drunk now still from last night. Apparently I got into an argument over nothing really after I'd blacked out. I'm sure it's fine and I'll apologise to my mate later today but it shouldn't really have ever happened. 

I love drinking because it puts me in a good and confident mood, feel like I can do anything, if it didn't do that there'd be no point. It can also make me an arrogant and aggressive twat however and has put me in fights, police cars and a lot of shame the following days. Things I'd never do if I was sober.

A lot of the time though, I don't feel much remorse for what I do when I'm black out drunk. Feels like a whole other person compared to me when I'm sober. In some cases I even think I have some respect for how little of a shit the drunk version of me has and wish I could be as open and less caring when I'm sober. 

But when I've done something bad it just feels useless to promise myself that I'll never do it again, no matter how shameful I am of what I've been told that I've done. I feel separated from that side of me as I have no recollection of it and so it is often hard to sincerely apologise for what I've done. I have very little control over what happens to me after I've been drinking and even after having just a couple of beers I am desperately trying to find more and more to the point at which I'm completely wasted. Never throwing up or passing out has been a blessing and a curse in that I just keep going after I'm already far too drunk and that's when the stupid shit starts.

The purpose of putting this up was more for me to get the thoughts out of me head. I can't see myself quiting drinking because I enjoy it too much and it doesn't always lead to shit but I'm aware that it often does. At some point in my life, sooner the better, I need to quit before my health, relationships and work becomes seriously affected more than it already is. I've been following this sub for a while now and I'm sure there's plenty of people all over the place who are in a similar position as me.

2020-02-01 17:48:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/exe1vo/30_day_reflection/,30 Day Reflection,"So like a lot of others, this is the longest I've been sober in a long time. Around 13 years I think.

I naturally gravitated toward alcohol and drugs as a self conscious fifteen year old. It gave me a sense of identity, when I had a beer in one hand and a smoke in the other I felt like the man. Cool as a cucumber, I could do anything. I was a party guy, I didn't  take life seriously, it was all about having fun. When really I was a very nervous kid who was so unaccepting of himself that he needed to create this 'identity' to feel like he could fit in.

This continued into my late teens and right through most of my twenties, there was spells where I would get away from it and begin to be comfortable with myself only to have it slowly reappear and eventually get out of hand. 

Looking back now I can see I had a real problem, sometimes the water was down at my ankles but at other times I could barely keep my head above it. I knew deep down I'd one day have to confront it but alcohol is so deeply ingrained that it felt like I'd be giving up something so fundamental to living. 

I gave up at the beginning of this year and honestly, if there was a time to do it, it was one of the other thousand times I felt like I hit bottom. This time I went out new years eve, had a great time with my friends, all the while knowing that this was the last time. I wanted to have a nice send off for my 13 year companion.

So I've felt clearer since. I haven't really lost any weight because I've been scoffing all manner of junk food but my mood has significantly improved. I've had a couple of these upward feelings where I'm so grateful to be alive and beginning this new journey I'm on, during these moments I'm remembering how precious life is and how I want to be there for my family, to be a good example for my nieces and nephews. 

This year for me is about exploring and understanding, I want to get to know who I REALLY am, not behind a veil of booze and smoke but the real me, flaws and all. 

I kind of feel like I'm trying to build a bridge back to the 15 year old, to sort of pick up where we left off. This year I want to discover life beyond alcohol.

This is kind of rambly and shmushy, I really just meant to write a quick post and this just sort of spilled out, anyway, I'm really thankful for this sub, it's helped me immensely!

Why on earth did I decide to have alcohol?

And then I actually woke up.  I feel so relieved that I didn't drink. I don't think I've been feeling particularly tempted lately, but I guess it must have been on my mind.

He did not ask again so assumed he was too. When he returned with 3 drinks I look at him and say this is a soda correct? He says yes. I take a sip and there is clearly vodka. I’m beyond frustrated and after I say something to him he was complete ignorant and indicates he assumed I wanted vodka. Fortunately my team members knew I do not drink and were equally as annoyed at the waiter. I was obviously frustrated and concerned I broke my streak but the fact is that this was a test and as frustrating as it is, after a single sip I moved right on and will continue to remain steady and commutes to an alcohol free life in the fact of any obstacle.

Today is the start of my 6th day without a drink. This is also my first sober weekend in literally who knows how long. At least five years- probably more. Last night when I got home from work the Friday-night cravings hit me REAL hard. There's no alcohol in the house, but there is a case of leftover wedding wine in the trunk of my husband's car that I had to hold myself down to stop from getting into. I cried, I cleaned the house, and I (ugh) smoked a few cigarettes while I waited for my husband to get home and get out of the house for the evening. I realized once I got past 8pm, I was in the clear. That's how its been every night this week. Everyday between 4:30-8pm, I am just going CRAZY. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, on the note of ""happiness"". Weekends over the past few months have been total drunken pity parties. I have just thought of them as ""introvert days"". This summer I moved to a new city for a new job. My husband works Saturdays, so I have the day to myself and have been shy to reach out to out to old friends or new work friends for daytime fun. So I would usually start drinking around 11am, and just go all day. Usually turning on a podcast and cleaning the house, doing ironing, etc. That's how I justified the drinking (it made housework more fun). Alas, my housework was sloppy...and whenever my coworkers asked what I did over the weekend I have always just demured and be like...""man I was so busy, I don't even know."" Embarassing.

&#x200B;

Anyway, today I'm going for a hike with my dog and an old friend from college. Then tonight my husband and I are having leftovers and continuing watching a cheesy rom-com. Its going to be a good day. I need to branch out and find ways to have fun with other people and stop holing myself up and giving myself excuses to drink.

Happy Saturday and IWNDWYT. :)",4

Financial stability has not truly returned to my life, but I have a decent helping of peace and acceptance, so there's that.

Example: 30 min from home I “chose” to stop and buy some vodka because I was feeling low. I “knew” what would happen if I came home drunk and I still did it. Who in there right mind would do that? I don’t like the idea that I was never in control but my actions make me question my sanity. How could I risk (and then lose) the most important people in my life for a micky of vodka. I have difficulty with the concept that the choice was not mine to begin with and that led to here because I feel that taking personal responsibility is important. I guess what I’m asking is, was it the addiction or me that stopped for that vodka?",7

As a drunk, in these situations I usually have a beer (or 4) and if I really am in hysteric mode I punch a wall and that’s it. Used to cut in my youth but I don’t do that anymore thanks god.


I talked about it to my therapist she told me to exercise (.... she couldn’t have picked up a thing that would anger me more) or some other bullshit therapy thing that obviously is not working.

I’ve been thinking all of this this week and wanted to get it out. Been lurking the subreddit for a while, wondering when I’d be one of you. Hoping. 

So here I go..

Unfortunately, five days ago we had our company outing. I work in a bar so almost everyone was drinking. I’m in a leadership position and got too fucked up and fell. I just feel this ongoing shame about it. I know it’ll fade like the rest of it, but it’s been a part of what’s motivating me to stop drinking. 

I see some of my coworkers and bosses who are either not heavy drinkers or have gone sober. The people that can drink casually I have started to envy. I’ve found myself the last couple of years being the one drinking the most in a group setting. I see how happy the sober ones are and I know in all likelihood that it is a constant battle for them. I want that strength. And I want the respect I have for them, respect of being who they are, leading their lives on their terms, not misguided by substance abuse. 

Working in bars makes this a bit... unique. I love the industry and don’t want to leave without trying my hardest at this. I know others have done it and I think I can too. Albeit not the healthiest place to be for me now. 

My relationship has been falling apart for what seems like forever. I’m certain that our problems are exacerbated by, if not already caused by, alcohol abuse. I want to change that so bad. I don’t know if too much damage has been done, but I’m on day five and I’m hoping my girl starts day one soon. I miss her. 

I want to enjoy concerts (and virtually everything else there is to do, that I do) without using it as an excuse to drink to excess. Or even to need to have one beer. I just want to not think about it and be in the moment. How often have my experiences been influenced or forgotten and how long will I do this?

I was at work today from 11a-4a. Yea. It wasn’t planned but you gotta do what you do. And I wasn’t working hard the entire time thank god. I was tired when we closed and annoyed and wanted that shot. But I didn’t.

Im excited to not be drinking right now. It’s the first time I’ve felt that way.

As I was driving home a part of me said 'It's early, let's go get a pack of cigarettes and get some shots!' I knew what would be next: A bottle to take home and finish.

I didn't go because it was my day with my oldest daughter. 'Your kid deserves better,' I thought. 'She needs her dad to be sober. Don't think about tomorrow, just think about today. Don't drink today.'

So I headed home. But there was another bar (there is always another bar) next to my house. 'No, (my partner) wouldn't like you going there (past drama). Just go home.'

So I got home. My daughter and I had reading time and we had a wonderful pizza night. 

But the urges didn't stop there. Later, my daughter, my girlfriend, and me are watching Pokemon when I send her to bed. I'm watching TV while my girl falls asleep. Then I think 'I can go get a few drinks and take her cigarettes. Just sneak out, like the good old days. 2, 3 shots of Rumplemintz, you'll feel amazing!' 

But I stopped myself. I just closed my eyes and went to bed. It was a close fight, my addiction almost got me but I survived. One day at a time.

I do have to go into a work a little this morning, but this is the only Saturday I’ll likely have to work this year, so I’m okay with it. 

I was playing botw (a Zelda game), and had a really great moment, and realization. My gaming time has gone down, and the types of games I enjoy are different, or at least more varied. I do enjoy the compulsive, and frenetic nature of online shooters, and the shooters based in historical conflict are becoming incredibly detailed. But, I probably played 3 hours this week. Drinking I could play little longer that. First part of sobriety this time I could play an hour and half, kinda push it to two some nights. So, three hours in a week is pretty significant.

In the evening, after exercise, I have been attending “meetings” here, and journaling more. 

And, I just had the best moment in the Zelda game. My sessions are much more enjoyable. The last Zelda game I played was the first one, and I remember bringing it home from the toys r us, popping it into my Nintendo, and setting off on an adventure. I’m back on that trail, my friends.

All that, and I have time for a peanut butter toast, and glass of almond milk. (I’ve already had about 4 cups of coffee, and some biscotti :) and a chance to start my new exercise plan, which I am little nervous about. It is a different gym, and a different routine, but I have given myself a chance to show up by staying sober. And, I’m under obligation to meet any marks, just do what I can.

Then work, then we’ll figure out the evening in the evening.

Thanks SD. I don’t have anyone else I can share this journey with.

I slept better, more focus, less anxiety, dropped a little weight(still working on that) but lately I've had a strong thought on my mind constantly, a kind of ""what's the point of all this"" and ""is this all there really is?"" type feeling.

Anyone else have these thoughts? I thought maybe it's just midlife. I'm 44. I thought maybe it's just the season too? Grey here in the midwest.

I've been kinda bummed because I've pretty much isolated myself which, I honestly need alone time to recharge, but I know I should be social and do stuff. I just feel like a stick in the mud at everything my wife and I do.

Everything being mostly revolving around drinking. I live in bourbon country and it's huge here.

I'm hoping that this is the low part I'm feeling while my brain chemicals are stabilizing and eventually I'll come back up 'feelings-wise'. If that makes any sense because that's 100% my own broscience.

Reading, a lot of people say get into something, etc. etc. I have a lot of hobbies. I go to the gym, etc. None if it has given me any joy lately. Just more of a ""what's the point"" feeling, honestly.

I quit drinking because it makes it harder to care for my elderly parents. And by parents, I mean in particular my mother. Since moving them next door last June, spending an evening with my mom has become another excuse to drink. 

I think if I just drink some wine with her, or a few beers before I go over (and then drink some more while I’m there, either with her or on the sly)  I can loosen up and tolerate what I see as an imposition on my time. A drain on my already depleted energy from running a business all day, a way to tamp down my resentment against my brothers who are not here to help. Instead, it makes it worse. While the actual evening is ok and I can talk and joke and it goes by faster, the overall effect is that I get angry.  My generosity, my kindness and patience dissolve as soon as the drink wears off. I get a little mean to my mom the next day. I waste alone time ranting and complaining. And then I avoid going over, or staying very long so as not to trigger that anger. So I miss out on spending time with my dad, miss out on having a sweeter relationship with my mom. I’m in a negative loop, because also I love my parents and want to take care of them

This week, this sober week, when there was a tense moment with my mom and I cut it off by rushing off to work, I did an about turn and took the time to pick flowers and brought them back in to her. Much better for everyone.",6

Gotta say that I'm feeling better than ever. Sleeping better, no longer on sleep meds (well I ran out, haha), more energy through the day, killing it at work, and renewed confidence and optimism. The healthier eating habits are probably helping as well, but overall not drinking has made a Huge Impact in my life. I love not being hungover several times a week. I've been partying hard since roughly 2007 and lately it was starting to catch up to me, so I made a move and it's paying off.

Won't lie, definitely tempted to have a drink or six on occasion but so far staying in check and planning for a 2020 without booze. The real test will come when I get back into nightlife events. Wish me luck! 

And if you need any motivation, please believe me when I say that you'll feel better than you ever, because I sure do!",7

Last year, I quit drinking, and I got through the first month by telling people I was doing Dry January. I really wanted to quit outright, but I was afraid of relapse and judgment from others, so I stayed quiet about my true feelings.

When February 1st came, I was a little nervous about losing this crutch I'd been using to explain my situation. I thought about trying to come up with another story or goal, but I couldn't think of anything that felt right. I also wasn't ready to tell people that drinking was hurting me and I didn't want to hurt anymore.

&nbsp; 

What I decided to do was tell those who asked that I felt pretty good about the last month, and that I'd like to keep going and just see what happens. If you're struggling with social pressure and expectations, I hope you find the strength to stay strong in pursuit of you goals.

But just 2 drinks reveal to me that alcohol is a bad drug as I am hungover/headache/heartburn. This is stupid and enough so that I will do a dry February...because it is for me. :)  

&#x200B;

I am proudly saying that IWNDTWY!

I have just emptied an almost full bottle of a nice port down the drain. Emotionally I feel great; physiologically, I feel miserable. Wow, omg, ethanol is really a bad drug. I want to share my story with all of you on this subreddit as I enjoyed so many of your stories.

&#x200B;

I'm 43 M and my whole adult life I have considered myself a ""normal"" drinker. I never really binged. I never blacked out. I like the taste of beer, I like the taste of (red) wine, I enjoy the taste of a nice whiskey. Drinking was always social and some weekends I had more drinks and some weekends I had no drinks. After work or in the summer, I enjoyed a nice, refreshing beer. I also liked a nice red wine with a dinner. But then, about 5 years ago, I discovered more and more whiskey and slowly but surely I started a more negative relationship with alcohol. This was stress and depression triggered. Work was stressful, boss was a bully (he is finally gone!! yeah!), family with kids was stressful. I would say that this was (is?) midlife crisis. 

My drinking at that time went towards bad, unhealthy levels and all the alcoholic's behaviors. My wife would have 1 glass of wine and I finish the bottle (on a weekday evening). My ""collection"" of whiskeys was looking awful with all bottles almost empty - I couldn't keep a bottle more than half full. I had thoughts at local liquor store if they started to recognize me. I would hide empty bottles a bit further in the back of the shelf or discard them into recycling so that people don't see it. I had the excuses of ""I just want to relax myself tonight"" and 1 whiskey was then 3 or 4 or 5 whiskeys before I went to bed. Yep, all that. So, when I started looking more after myself I got counseling therapy. Things improved! I also started intermittent fasting and started regular swimming. I had a revelation/shock as one day I was really sick from a bad flu/cold and was coughing. I was even off work for a week which was a first. I had high blood pressure, I was overweight/low obese range, poor physical conditions with out of breath after a few steps, I had depression, I was totally stressed, I was pre-diabetic and I had a heartburn issue for 20+ years.  Then I had chest pain! I finally got is checked out and heart was ok - the chest pain was from constant coughing. 

I started skipping my breakfast, a typical 16:8 on IF, and I stopped drinking alcohol (""all these empty calories""). Over several months, I lost 40 lb and went from 4 prescription drugs to eventual 0!! My blood values were again all in the normal range again. A new healthy me again! My drinking though started to creep up again. My wife was very supportive and I decided not to have any whiskey in the house. Wine was bought when needed, so was beer. I knew it had an issue as I just could not keep a half full whiskey in the house. I could never just have 1 drink of whiskey. 

I saw a unhealthy pattern of drinking emerging again. And with that in December, I decided to do ""dry January""! I saw this sub and I heard about other people. I also started it on Dec 21. Well, it was Dec 24 and my last drink was on Dec 21. Over Xmas I didn't want to drink so this was convenient. So, January rolls around and all went very fine. I felt great. Relaxed. My over-the-counter heartburn meds I didn't need to take. I had some non-alcohol beers and even a non-alcohol red wine (was ok tastewise). 

But then I felt, what do I do when Feb comes around? Do I just keep going? Or, a drink on Feb 1 to ""celebrate"" but that felt stupid. Why do others commit to 0 alcohol? Can I be just ""normal"" drinker?  

So, a few days ago, I found this liquor store gift card from Xmas and I bought wine for my wife and I saw a nice port (""old aged port"") on sale - so I grabbed that for me. And so, Jan 31 comes around and I keep thinking more about this. Cravings started around Jan 29 and shall I drink? Or, I started ""dry January"" well in advance so if I drink on Jan 31 I would have 44 days. But that sounded silly. 

So, yesterday, I had more cravings and 1 min after midnight I just had a glass of port (tasted nice) and one glass of red wine (also nice). All was good and I went to bed. But now, even while I am typing this. I have a headache (which is very rare for me), I have bad heartburn (took some meds). OMG, I am hung over! By just 2 drinks that is it!! I cannot believe this. I assume my body was so accustomed to ethanol that I never really noticed what good can feel. Wow! 

So, after letting dogs out for a pee. I went into the kitchen and drained down that almost full bottle of port. I will do dry February! I still can't believe that only 2 drinks of ethanol can have such effects on my body. Alcohol is a poison and I just realized this. But alcohol is still around us all with society and socially accepted and socially encouraged. Maybe I will have a beer, or I just stick with non-alcohol beer. I also think I maybe shouldn't plan out my life...LOL. But what I now know is that I will have ""dry February"" not because it is the right thing to do or that I am pressured. I am doing this as I really felt great in my own body for those 45 days that I didn't drink. That will be my main reason: I like to feel good.

So, with that, IWNDTWY! ;)",6

So this is day 6 of quitting drinking. One of my coworkers quit smoking a few years ago and can have like two drinks once a week or two.

""Well you still smoke cigarettes. Those are worse for you. Itll tear up your lungs.""

""Tried that before but every time I drank I'd lose my willpower by buying a pack.""

""Well just quit them both!""

Like, is it normal for people outside of the alcoholism gang to try and control how you quit? I have a plan. Once I stop having intense alcohol cravings the next step is smoking. I have a plan. I'm just annoyed.",10

But realized that feeling has gotten me into trouble before (I can stop again, look what I just did, a whole month!) This time, I had almost forgotten how to be around others after 5:00 without a drink in my hand. And at home I convinced myself that it was okay to keep filling up my glass of red wine over and over again. 

I convinced myself of a lot of things - that wine eased disappointments when it was making me spiral downward, that it calmed my nerves when it put me more on edge, and, I am sad to say, that I was still sharp, when I wasn’t sharp at all. 

I can go a whole day now without thinking about alcohol. I love waking up without the regret. I am going through a betrayal by my best friend, and I haven’t had a drink. And I managed a party last weekend where I was the only non drinker. I could see that drunk people are not compelling to be around!  I felt like my eyes were opened - drinking can make people loud and rude and irresponsible, or sad, or stupid. That was hard to see when I was acting that way too. But I am still scared. 

Next week I will meet some people for dinner. Lovely people who love booze. One posts pictures of drinks on Instagram frequently. Her SO owns several bars. I don’t want to talk about my not drinking, I just want to not drink. And I don’t want to sit at home, because the people I know all drink. I am sure I will make new friends eventually, but since I just was stabbed in the back by my best friend, and I am middle aged, it isn’t super easy. 

My question is this:  when does the fear of being asked or pressured about alcohol leave you?",3

Having reached this point once before, this shouldn't feel as special, but it does and I've this subreddit to thank for it.","I've always known I've have an addiction problem. Not just with alcohol, but with anything that gives me a feeling that is able to distract me from the emptiness of being sober. From my teens I have spent most of my days under the influence of something. Be that smoke, drink, painkillers and so on. That's why this time feels entirely different to any of my previous attempts.

One of the posts on here spoke about the warped relationship we have with something that destroys us mental and physically. The analogy use was if we knew something like a banana made as feel like drink does, the sickness, the fear, the anxiety, we would just stop. Something clicked.

I was able to view my relationship with alcohol (and other substances) differently. It's an abusive relationship. It makes me feel safe, valued, strong for a short period before it shows it's true nature and beats me mentally and physically once again. And I kept going back. I wouldn't allow that to happen with anything else in my life. So why should I allow it with drink. 

I wake up today, not only sober, but happy that I am. Not counting days like an achievement, but thankful that for now at least, I'm not looking to some excuse that makes it ok in my head to drink. I feel content. I feel a sense of peace that I havent felt before. I'm able to embrace the calmness and quiet that comes with sobriety and I'm able to enjoy the feeling that used to drive me to seek some sort of stimulant. 

It's still very early days, but something feels much different and with all sincerity, I have this community to thank for that.

So from the bottom of my not so numb heart, I thank you.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*
 
**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**
 
I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.
 
Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.
 
It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!
 
What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.
 
**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.
 
**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I think most people i know will tell you im not an alcoholic, but i've been completely checked out and self-medicating for a decade now.  I don't think i had a turning point.  I just had enough of the booze and everything that came with it.

This might be the pink cloud talking but despite how hard it was to initially withdraw, leave friends that didn't serve me, reconcile not going to old haunts anymore (because im that type of drinker) and deal with all the ""accidentally took a drink"" nightmares, things are really turning around for me.  Strangely fast.

I quit a okay paying but dead end office job i hated.  A friend that also left that job helped me get a job i liked better that i could work from home.  i applied to a college.  I got accepted, AND i got a lot of extra aid because i am now a ""non-traditional student""  i have loans, but very small ones that i actually believe i can pay off.

I moved to a different state to go to that college.  Yesterday at a community dinner, i got asked by a retired faculty person that used to work with the school i attend about what i want to do professionally, and i talked to him about wanting to combine my sales experience with some other discipline, and potentially own my own buisiness.  He told me about a management opportunity locally that would open for the summer and said i can have the job if i want.  An opportunity that would both pay me and give me very credible management experience that noone back at home would have given me from in a million years, i just got.  And technically i didn't even ask.

For the first time in a long time, i feel like i have a very clear, albeit difficult, path in front of me.  And if i work REALLY hard this year, im going to have a very solid foundation on which to grow my professional life.

And it started because i decided i didn't want to keep burying my problems in a bottle, and that idea gained traction by browsing here.

I just want to say thank you to the community for existing, and offer my encouragement to anyone who wants to be, or continues to be sober.  You can do this!

2020-02-01 00:02:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ex16go/the_hole/,The Hole," I fell into a hole one day.  
It swallowed me up and took me away.  
I clawed and I scraped; I tried to break free,  
But the hole wouldn't loosen its tight grip on me.  


I found my dreams in a hole one day,  
The hopes I once thought that I'd thrown away.  
They darted and weaved; they chased me around.  
My unfounded joys came tumbling down.  


I lost track of myself in a hole one day.  
Failure's dim shadow had led me astray.  
I looked high and low, but my past life was gone.  
The hole was my chance to move up and move on.  


I'm climbing out of a hole today.  
I'm leaving a world drawn in shades of gray.  
I'll trip and I'll fall on the slippery slope  
Of the hole that took me and forgot to bring hope.  


But I'll still get out of this hole today.  
Its darkness and lies will no longer hold sway.  
I'll fight and I'll struggle; I'll regain control.  
And pull myself out of this cavernous hole.",23

Then right back to the bottle thinking I could handle it. Most people who know me would say I'm the friendliest, most polite, outgoing guy that could make a friend anywhere. When I'm sober that is. That's not who's in control when I'm drinking. I'm not the fun, life of the party drunk. I'm the blackout, angry, hurtful drunk. Jekyll and Hyde. Alcohol has cost me everything dear, including my freedom for a brief stint. I'm losing my wife who is truly the love of my life, but has suffered through more of the angry, drunk stranger than her sober, loving husband in the past years. I've had to fight for any custody of our children that mean more than anything in the world to me. I was father of the year to people's faces, but the drunk or hungover shut in that couldn't take them to the park or the movie they wanted to see. If I let alcohol take control again, I will lose what little I've got left, it not my life. It's day 5 again. I'm working the steps. I'm not giving up or giving in again. I will continue to work on this everyday for the rest of my life, and for now, IWNDWYT.",3
