I started a partial hospitalization program for trauma this week and I am trying to keep my five shifts per week schedule serving / bartending, since I live alone and support myself. This was my second 15 hour day in a row. I'm exhausted emotionally and physically and all I wanted my entire shift was that magical potion of hops and barley that would give me a little break and release the Good Chemicals‚Ñ¢.

2021-09-29 23:50:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pybso1/day_15_checking_in/,"Day 15, checking in.","Hey SD,

I am finally wrapping up day 15. Being free of the stress related to when I will drink next, is quite a liberating experience. I no longer have to think about how I have to hold off from drinking before class, or during the day.

It also seems like I am starting to enjoy normal things again a lot more. I feel like I need to stop smoking weed to gain the full benefits of this.

No more waking up with a stomach ache while excessively dehydrated either.

On Saturday, I went to go play poker with some friends. They were all drinking around me, but I told them that I stopped drinking to keep myself accountable, and so that I wasn't offered anything. Nobody judged me, and while it was triggering to see them cracking open cans, I simply just drank coke and played. I was really proud of myself for not getting too triggered, I simply told myself that drinking makes my life worse, and that short term pleasure is not worth the long term consequences.

I'm starting to see that a life without drinking is doable. It's still not easy. I still have cravings all the time, and seeing people drink is really triggering. Being only 21 (yes, I'm hardly old enough to drink yet I have a problem), drinking culture is extremely pervasive. I don't go to a massive party school, but I still encounter it pretty often.

But ultimately, I remember that they have a different relationship with alcohol. The guys playing with me are just having a beer or three to loosen up socially, and are maybe getting a bit tipsy. They're not getting shitfaced wasted, and they're certainly not going to down shots of vodka when they get home like I would. They also don't think about alcohol 24/7. However, I think next time, I'm going to bring some NA beer.

I'm glad that I've finally gotten a few days done now. The hard part is mostly over. I just need to continue the way I am and I will be at 3 digits before I know it.

Generally speaking things are positive. I'm  losing weight, sleeping better and I'm more productive in the non social aspects of my work. I would say I was a heavy drinker at around 4-5 drinks a day.

Come to realize I now have a very hard time formulating conversation on the fly. In talking with new people I often feel awkward and the words just don't come to me. I'm the President of a company and often my meetings with other businessmen center around alcohol. 

I really enjoy partying, going out with friends and honestly I think I miss that aspect much more than the feeling of alcohol. It genuinely has helped me form valuable business connections and friendships which remain in the absence of alcohol.

This is my first time here and its taken a lot to even write this but i could use any input.

And because of this, my IOP ostracized & belittled me - making my recovery path so much more difficult. But maybe it‚Äôs my addict speaking?","I really hesitated to post this (fearing more backlash) but I don‚Äôt really have anywhere else to go. I was in an IOP and proceeded with continuing care with the same provider. Other than a 60k stay at a different hospital‚Äôs retreat - there weren‚Äôt many options other than this IOP provider, AA, and Smart Recovery. But I quit. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. It was supposed to be independent from AA - but every therapist and counselor was associated with AA & was a fundamental believer in AA. Any time I was honest in group, and brought up my problems with the steps, or even studies that have results that even hint at a problem with AA‚Äôs philosophy, I was told to ‚Äúget over your ego; you‚Äôre too smart for your own good‚Äù, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs your alcoholic speaking‚Äù, ‚Äúyou must be drinking again or trying to‚Äù, & my favorite: ‚Äúyou have to trust the process‚Ä¶you‚Äôre new and you haven‚Äôt accepted what you need to accept yet‚Äù. I once asked what the goal was - should we just expect to be in AA for the rest of our lives and anticipate a couple relapses throughout the journey? I really meant my question. The counselor laughed at me. Along with other group members who are AA diehards. Great. I‚Äôm not even doing recovery right apparently.

The IOP provider billed my health insurance. For MEDICAL care that they ‚Äúprovided‚Äù. Quite a bit of money too. CPT codes filled out, forms filed and completed. I have never had a medical professional order me a treatment protocol that involved a higher power and asking my mom to forgive me because of my disorder. It feels a little insurance fraudy to be honest. Is Alcohol Use Disorder a mental health, medical disorder or not? 

I am so frustrated and I was going to type something about how I understand how AA has helped so many people, yada yada - but I don‚Äôt have it in me. How is it that the US, a supposed leader in medical care, is still mainly using a ‚Äútreatment approach‚Äù written in 1939 that remains largely the same?

29 y/o male, long time lurker, first time poster!  It has taken me a long while to get to this point but I am glad to be here.  This sub has always filled me with joy with how supportive you all are to one another.  In the interim I don't plan on discussing this with my friends, coworkers, or family but simply wish to come clean and open myself up to yall.  

I have never been an everyday drinker, lost a job or a relationship to drinking, gotten a DWI or drunk in public, etc.  Nobody has ever brought up concern for my level of drinking.  I seem to fall into that Grey Zone drinking for those of you who have seen the TED Talk.  Hell I've never even had a true rock bottom moment to bring clarity to my decision to stop.

What I have had though is plenty of embarrassing drunken moments as well as moments that have brought me an excess of shame and anxiety.  I can't go out for just one or two beer it always escalates to more and quite frequently I end up as the drunkest one in the group.  It's like when I was born I was born without the ""Off"" or ""Regulator"" switch. 

 I've had so many nights that I have gone overboard with drinking that I'm fortunate that I have had friends that have had my back and made me get home.  This loss of self control is scary for me because my mind gets flooded with the ""what ifs"" and all the other uncertainties that flood my anxiety levels.  I have a great career that has a zero tolerance policy for any alcohol related incidences and I'm lucky I have never screwed up enough on one of my nights off to find my way into jeopardy.  I've been described as a happy drunk, a ""stumbly"" drunk, and a sleepy drunk never violent or annoying but I don't  want to be described as any type of drunk anymore.   I want to put an end to my maladaptive relationship with alcohol  and avoid any problems for myself, my health, my friendships / relationships, and my career.

This could be the key to overcoming my biggest trigger to drink.,"Last week I posted during the middle of a week long stretch of sobriety and asked this community if I should speak with my doctor about my issues with alcohol. I had an appointment tomorrow anyway just as check up with my anti-depressants (which have really helped ease the anxiety that triggered a lot of drinking habits before) so today I typed up an email to him and let him know that I was sending this so I didn't get scared or embarrassed tomorrow while I was there. I told him that while the anti-depressants have eased my daytime anxiety they haven't helped much with the night time panic attacks that caused me to seek medication in the first place and while I had hoped that after one month of the medicine not taking those away  it was still not fully effective and would get better. I told him that I hoped that the heart palpitations and difficulty breathing was caused by natural anxiety after two months on the medication I'm ready to admit what I knew in my heart of hearts was really withdrawal. 



I haven't been able to get further than a week or two lately because I can deal with one or two panic filled nights in a row without when it gets to 3,4,5,6 I start to wear down from lack of sleep and pure terror. For example the last two nights I drank after being sober for about a week.. It sucks to start at day one again today but that was final nail in the coffin for me to get professional help battling withdrawal because mentally I never want to drink again. It's been months since I've drank socially and have succeeded in refusing alcohol in social settings. its almost purely been to battle my physical symptoms at night. So while I'm disappointed I'm starting again today, knowing that help could be on the way to battle these soul crushing withdrawals  is going to give me the strength to fight through until tomorrow sober. 

I don't know what to expect, some people have said they have been given medication for similar issues, others have said they needed to be kept for observation for a few nights. I'm open to either and while being held for observation wouldn't be ideal I'd have to use sick days etc, I live alone and one thing that does cause me to reach for the bottle when withdrawal starts to get bad is fear of dying and being found dead days to weeks later. I don't wanna go out like that.

It's funny that in deciding to stop drinking, I truly begun to realize how large of a part of my life it had become and what I used it for.  

I remember 16 or 17 and sneaking some of my dad's vodka and watering down.   Drinking some before hanging with friends to hide the awkwardness and social anxiety that teens do.   I think that happened a few times.  I did not even drink much in college as I was too busy working and going to school.   I had a child at an early age, and did not start drinking regularly until after my first divorce around 28 or so.     

Instead of leaving or working on my second marriage I drank and did other escapist behaviors.  the drinking would wax and wane - but was there.   We would have wine every night with dinner.   

I also got into beer making.  How is that for a denial hobby!  ?

After that marriage ended, I was not daily drinking but would binge once a month or so.   I switched jobs where going out with clients and happy hour was the culture.  

 I also had a drinking buddy.  This started about 2013 to 2016.  We'd drink to excess 2 or 3x a week.  I once calculated how much that was a month.  Around $400.   That's a car payment.  

I promised myself I'd stop and bought a second car .  I bargained that I would use that $400 on a car payment.  Guess what? that did not work. 

I stared a spiritual practice in 2018 that helped a bit.   

I've been in a relationship for a while but feeling anxiety as they're a drinker and there's been trust issues.   They're supportive of me stopping but seems to minimize that I have an issue.   Sigh.  Maybe I need / should divulge more to them.   Like the times I've stumbled in my door and fallen, pissed myself, blacked out, not taking care of daily things.    

Anyway.  Thanks for having me.

Weirdness aside, I tried AA meetings and could just not get into it.  The spirituality and steps/readings was not for me, and also, I noticed the majority of the people in the meetings (I tried about 4 different ones) were 50+ years old.  Obviously we need help at any age, however as a 30 year old female I found it difficult to connect and they all seemed to connect better as they were all in a similar age range.  That wasn‚Äôt the reason I didn‚Äôt like AA, but an observation.  

I recently discovered SMART recovery through this sub (again, you guys are the best) and thought I‚Äôd give it a try.  I joined the chat rooms there and attended my first meeting.. once again, majority of the crowd was 50+.  I only tried one meeting so far as I just joined yesterday so I‚Äôm not giving up - also I enjoyed their approach much more than AA so I am grateful for finding them. 

I guess I‚Äôm just ranting as I‚Äôm finding it extremely difficult to find a crowd of 30 year old age range females who may relate with me.  No matter what, I‚Äôm determined to get sober.. however through my searches I‚Äôve found recovery groups for youth 20+under or generalized adult platforms which through my experience have been 50+.  Where the middle ground sober searchers at? 

Anyway again, just reaching out incase maybe I‚Äôve missed an opportunity to be able to relate to those in my age range and/or sex.. and possibly hear stories of any of your fellow struggles to relate in your recovery.

I've had a day one before. Hell, I went the whole month of June without drinking just because after memorial day, I decided: This is enough. I didn't really do anything drastic or harm others like you hear sometimes, this is just an every day thing that I feel is slowly consuming my mind, little by little, day after day.

You want to know how I screwed up? I set a goal of ""I'm not gonna drink until the fourth of July. Then, we're gonna have some beer, celebrate America, then get back to business."" The problem though? I just went back to my old habits. I knew right then and there, I screwed up on that one!

I have drank since I was like 15. Around that same time, I was a heavy stoner. Mostly though, I liked my pot. Smoked it religiously all the way to college graduation because my career does random drug tests, so I had to quit. Around that time though, I was also growing tired of the same ol' routine so it was kind of a blessing to have something that MADE me quit. Keeps me accountable, you know?

After that, I would go buy a 30 pack of beer and a fifth of whiskey about every two weeks from the local store. I'd chip away at them each day. I was hoping by moving out to the country, that going to the liquor store would be a big inconvenience. Unfortunately, the town next door became wet. In Arkansas, we have wet vs dry counties/territories due to old religious based laws and practices.

So from April through the end of May, I'd buy a 30 pack of Busch Light every weekend. By the time the next weekend came along, it was time for another trip. I know deep down my wife is concerned but she just doesn't have the will to say anything, probably because she is afraid of pissing me off or something. So I would like to try to conquer this with myself and then also lean on you guys and reading other testimonies and just being a part of a community that props each other up. 

I've lurked this community for a long time on my old Reddit account. Guess who blacked out one night and forgot their password to their Reddit account and old email? Me! 

Back to the topic though, I had a similar mindset that I did when I got tired of smoking marijuana. I was just tired of it dictating my lifestyle. Planning my whole damn routine around it. It's just that I have substituted smoking for drinking. Deep down, I don't really have any issues, I'm just a socially awkward guy that keeps a close circle. Once I'm around people long enough, you see the real me and most people just enjoy me, or at least they do a helluva job pretending, LOL!

I have also been wanting to cut some of my weight down. I went from 350 to 325 in a short span in 2020, before Covid happened. I still drank all through then. I've noticed that I have been keeping 325 no matter what and I am really starting to wonder what all would change if I just quit drinking? I don't have a problem with cold turkey because that's how I stopped nicotine and marijuana. 

Not only physically, I really wonder how much this subtle disease has affected my mind over the years. I try to think back to how I was when I was a younger guy. I was way more outgoing, and I don't remember having a lot of anxiety and just sweating profusely or being on pins and needles all the damned time. My only thing back then, was that I was just a shy kid, usually someone else had to make the first move in terms of a conversation but then usually it turned out well.

I used to read a lot, my mind was REAL sharp back then. I've noticed especially these handful of years, even as I was working through college, my mind has been slipping more and more. I find it hard to remember the little details, or just keep up with everyone. I have odd phases to where I'm socially active and then I'll just up and ghost people, other than my immediate family for like months on end. I have a problem trying to have coherent thoughts, I still have a great long term memory, I just feel like short term is kind of fucked, and also the mental action of recalling thoughts during conversation.

Recently, I told myself that I wanted to stop drinking. I had about six beers left and the past two days, I'd have three each and just go through my routine but these past two days, I just keep having the same thought of ""I'm tired of this. I want my mind back. Hell, I want my life back. I miss the old me."" A version of myself that many people loved over a decade ago. My wife loves me the way I am now, with all my faults, bless her heart, but she deserves that extra bit that I used to give everyone. That time when I really loved myself and others more and just did not let the external world phase me other than what's needed.

Plus, it will be an interesting experience to see what it's like to watch the Razorbacks play football and not just be buzzing my butt off during a big game and raising all sorts of hooplah like I did against A&M the past weekend.

I know it won't be easy though, because my Mom likes to drink quite a bit and every time I visit her, we dig into her expensive whiskey. Last time she went to Memphis, she sent me a picture of their latest haul, bottles and bottles of Maker's Mark, Basil Hayden's, etc. You can kind of see where my habits come from.

As for Dad, he's getting older, my parents have been long divorced. Dad was the big stoner. He still smokes but he's the only guy I know that smokes these days so it's easy to stay away from marijuana, especially with my career to boot. Dad used to like drinking beer like me but he's ditched alcohol for a good month, and the only times he would drink is when I'd buy him some. He's lost 20 pounds since his last checkup.

Before this gets too long, I just wanted to introduce myself as Shane and actually follow my first instinct to stop drinking. Do you guys also have an internal dialogue of wanting to do something good and then your mind convinces you to not follow through and keep the same routine?

Part of me wonders how much of a stranglehold alcohol has had over me these years. I really think I'm in for a surprise but you know, that might just re-enforce the fact of staying clean for good.  I cannot wait to read your comments and carry on the conversation and see if anybody else had similar experiences, or has good advice from these similar encounters. One day, I'd hope to come back here and read someone new like myself, and then say ""Hey man, i've been here before."" 

Thanks for reading, if you've made it this far. Sorry if this was long winded, but I wanted to follow my first whim to actually speak up on here. Have a great day! It's been a good one so far, I have no idea what I'm gonna do after 5pm this evening because I'm not having to worry about getting beers on ice before I do X,Y, and Z.

Here are my thoughts","It's three years to the day since my last drink. I barely remember it like it was yesterday. On my last night of drinking, I promised not to get drunk, then drank alone in a garage through the entirety of a child's birthday party, drove my family home (drunk) and faded to black. I was sitting in my first AA meeting less than 24 hours later. 

AA saved my life. I don't care if it's a trope. I am alive today because the people in those rooms took me in, showed me the way and I was beat down enough to listen. There are so many close calls, drunk accidents, fights, health and legal issues and insane decisions... I really don't know how I survived long enough to even make it to the rooms but I know I wouldn't have made it much longer. 

I'm posting today to share hope. I used to think I was a mid-bottom drunk because I never killed anyone or went to jail. I later heard from others I was probably a low-bottom drunk based on my story. Eventually, I realized it didn't matter. The important part is the recovery - and I am recovered. Not recover-ING. Recover-ED.

Since getting sober, I have a peace I've never had. I have patience, I love deeper, I can experience being loved, I can provide and be of service. My marriage was saved, I lost 40 pounds, our sex is 20x better, I make triple what I did when I was drinking, I paid off all my taxes, lawsuits, legal fees and maxed out credit cards. I am a parent to my kid - like an actually present one involved in her world. I've dealt with mental health issues previously hidden by self-medication with drugs and alcohol. You literally would not recognize me, whether looking at me or my actions. I still have problems, defects and struggle. It's not perfect and it never will be. But it doesn't have to be and I know no substance or destructive behavior is going to fill that hole. The longing I felt will sometimes return - and when it does, there is a solution: the 12 Steps.

They're not for everyone and that's ok. There's definitely more than one way to get sober, you can clearly see from this sub. 

If you're new, if you're suffering, if you don't know what is going to get you out of the hell you are in: I suggest you give them a fair shot, even if you're not a religious or spiritual person (I wasn't, though now I'm spiritual).

I am a 31 year old male. I have been struggling with substance abuse since the day that i started using them. That is since the age of 15. I have been 10 months sober about 2 years ago. Lately i feel like i'm getting out of control with drinking. 

It has been having a negative impact on everything. It also had a negative impact on my work. I find that very sad because i work as a caregiver. I have gone to work a couple of times still drunk, and i am ashamed of that.

This time I am hoping to rectify that and I need to know some things....

 First a rundown of me:

I am an alcoholic. It has been hard to say those words for the usual reasons but also because nearly everyone in my family drinks as much as I do. But I am and I hate it. I don't need a drink at 10 in the morning, my work is less affected and no one has ever talked to me about it.

BUT...

I can take days off but I can't stop at one, or two, or three drinks. If one is good fifteen is better. I struggle to take more than 2 days off and tell myself I am doing well but then drink a week's worth of booze in a day or two and always telling myself a six pack will be enough. I find myself getting jealous of people who can.

Lockdown has also messed me up.

My fiance is the one I have been waiting for, and she's here and doing her best (ALanon and so on) but she's not gonna stick around forever if this is what it is.

I have tried AA, therapy and the pills that make you sick when you drink. AA did help but I can't get past the god bit, my therapist tried her best but didn't understant and I stopped with the pills because I like beer better.

So  to my questions:

1. How do you deal with boredom? I am ok with shit sleep for a while but the day to day is hard. I can get 2-3 days deep then I just think; have a drink and one leads to ... How do you chew through that time when it would be so easy to order something in?
2. What do you do about friends and family who drink or expect you to drink? I have some weddings and so on coming up, do you just say I am not drinking? 
3. Once you're past the cravings what do you do? I have lived so long with alcohol as a part of my life, I am terrified I don't know how to live sober.
4. Do you lose weight?

I am sorry and I know these are different for everyone and probably covered already, but any advice would be wonderful.

TLDR; I feel like I am going to always have an incomplete social feeling and never reach the level of connectedness I had with most people I socialised with. Is this something people can comment on or are experiencing? how are you addressing it?

I read somewhere about the [alienation-connectedness continuum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Alienation-connectedness_continuum_%28Killeen%2C_1998%29.png), from negative to positive, it is *alienation -- loneliness -- social isolation -- aloneness -- solitude -- connectedness*.

60 days came and went and it was so easy I didn't even post the accomplishment because it somehow didn't feel 'earned'. Day 60 was a good day. 

Days 63-66 have been awful. I've had to consciously focus on driving straight home after work to avoid stopping at the liquor store. I've had long and drawn out mental debates about the pros and cons of giving myself a night off. I litterally had a coworker tell me she was gonna just drop a bottle of whiskey off on my porch for me because she could see how stressed I am.

Oh... I think I need to quit my job. And that sucks, because the market isn't great and my family is 100% dependant on my income but the vast majority of my coworkers go home and actively drink to deal with work stress. Actually, my coworkers introduced me to several types of alcohol and really broadened my drinking experience. They're honestly great people. It's not their fault that I can't stop drinking at ten and go to bed like a normal person. This isn't meant to cast blame on them. But still...I don't know if I can stay there.

Anywho...today is day 67.

But the stress of the last few days has thrown the diet out the window, so the thoughts of alcohol have been more prominent. Already screwed up the fasting window, might as well grab a drink. You can reset tomorrow, right?

I'm not going to. I know it's a funk. There's a good chance that five days from now I'll look back on today and wonder what I was whining about. But right now it sucks.

You all know that voice. The one who says it'll help me relax, destress, it's just one! That turns into several. Then I wake up feeling miserable...

I'm at the heaviest I've ever been, even pregnant. My liver levels are too high. I sweat buckets. 

I know why I drink: pain, both physical and emotional. Working on both - starting to finally accept both. Acceptance is half the battle right?

Today is Day 8 of the sober life. Yesterday, was extremely challenging and I was so tempted to come home and have a few drinks! 

I was on vacation last week and I had an employee that evidently decided to go rogue and act like he was in charge and acting disrespectful towards me (while I was not there) in front of my boss, the CEO. He is new but thinks he knows everything, is still in his probationary period, and I have been considering letting him go even before my vacation. The employees in my department requested a meeting with me regarding him and even coworkers from other departments came to me regarding him. The problem is my CEO is out of town until next week, and I have requested a meeting with him next week regarding this guy not working out (They are foreign owners and their culture is different in relation to handling situations at work, so I definitely respect their culture regardless). 

Additionally, the last 1.5 weeks of the month are the largest check runs that we have. We are a manufacturer and have one distributor (our main customer for our machines), that we invoice and get payment for once a month, on the last day of the month. Usually, my Accounting Specialist will mark up the AP aging and let me review and approve to be sure we are good with our cash balance prior to printing checks. Last week, she asked our CEO and he said yes. it was all good......not it wasn't. Well, after checks were printed and sent, I reviewed our cash standing upon returning Monday and we have gone negative by quite a lot. I informed our CEO, who is out of town and he wanted to monitor the checking. I spent yesterday scrambling and corresponding with our CEO (texting as he is out of town), as all of these checks started clearing the account, for authorization to move money from our sister company's accounts; in order to cover what was coming through.

Chronic relapser here.... Been trying to quit or moderate for a long time now... Over 15 years.

Currently on day 2 on my latest attempt.

I've also been using various substances ""recreationly"" - marijuana, coke, MDMA, ecstacy and more than likely have a horrendous relationship with sex. I use all these things to distract and alter how I feel. With the caveat that ""alcohol is my problem, nothing else."", but that's not true. I use these substances exactly the way I use alcohol, to excess and often. The only difference is that I don't behave as abhorrently as I do when I'm drunk or drinking.

I've also found that additional use of the substances listed above eventually leads to an alcohol relapse. The thought process goes, ""well I'm already not sober from my drug use, and I don't currently have access to those drugs, so what's the harm in drinking?"".

The harm is drunk driving. As I did last weekend. Missing work, as I did on Monday. Worrying my family as I have all week. Missing or neglecting my responsibilities as a friend and human being. And being absolutely wrecked physically and mentally. Sweats. Cramps. Headaches. Vomiting. Suicidal thoughts.

I always thought a life based on relentless honesty was impossible. That everyone lies and manipulates.... But I think I'm starting to realise that relentless honest starts with myself.


This feeling may pass. I may slip back into complacency and find myself here again. On another day 2. Sweet jesus I hope not. This is awful.

-Learning about the buzz lasting 20-30 minutes and the comedown lasting 2-3 hours per drink was a game changer. Once my BAC goes down, I feel worse than I did before the drink. Really changed my perspective.

-Learning how alcohol numbs the senses made me realize I wasn't getting the full experience of my fun times while drinking. My wit is much sharper sober and my experiences and bonding stick with me emotionally more.

-Alcohol is a crutch and I need to know what I think it ""solves"" for me and overcome that in other ways. I.e. the notions that alcohol helps me unwind, alcohol helps me overcome social anxiety, alcohol makes me feel more loose and free.

-The vicious cycle of alcohol and anxiety got me good. I knew alcohol wasn't good for my mental health but I underestimated how much it contributed to my anxiety. 

-I'm not a failure for having a tough relationship with alcohol and struggling to moderate. It's addictive and there are scientific reasons why it makes me feel bad and I still would want to drink it.

-I'm around alcohol all the time so I worried about cravings, but I learned they only last 15-20 minutes. Haven't had problems resisting temptation.

-Speaking of which, it was valuable for me to learn that using willpower alone is a losing battle, since we run out of it eventually.

-I still feel like I'm in over my head. I keep telling myself I'm just stopping for 30 days but I know internally that quitting altogether is what I want. The thought feels overwhelming so I'm really trying to take it one day at a time. 

This experiment has been incredible so far. I'm excited when 24 hours is up and I unlock the next lesson. The combination of scientific and cultural information and guidance on mindset has led to lots of introspection. I feel more optimistic and in control than I have in a long time.

I saw a ted-talk yesterday about grey-zone drinking. This exactly my kind if drinking: Not so bad that anyone have ever told me I should quit, but a constant source of worry and self-loathing to myself. My partner even seemed suprised and a bit dissapointed that I will no longer enjoy the occational glass of sparkling with her. (she doesn't drink much at all)  Reading the posts in this forum makes me feel like I really dodged the bullet of alcoholism, if I can stick with it. 

The tricky thing about being a grey-zone drinker is that you face no pressure from anyone but yourself to quit. The whole world is all too happy to let you go on believing that 2 beers every single evening is not a problem, even if they 6-7% vol. 4-5 every friday and saturday. You're still fine. But I know now, and I felt for a long time, that this is not true. When I was drinking I did not want to know more about the negative affects of alcohol, but now I've began looking into it, to try to better understand why things have improved so much since I quit.

The biggest thing for me, is that my anxiety is pretty much gone. I was emotionally unstable for years and this caused me to keep messing things up for myself. I believe I came across as a weirdo in a lot of situations, with these exaggerated emotions that I was wearing on my sleeve, always feeling very self-conscious in social situations, even with close friends. The smallest thing could cause me to completely loose my cool and trigger my fight or flight mode. I was probably right to think that this caused me to be an exhausting and sometimes embarrassing company. I probably came across as insincere, untrustworthy and distracted, as well as boring. I always found myself trying to figure out what to say, not being able to go with the flow and just speak my mind and relax. I felt slow and unable to be present in most situations. I noticed years ago that I felt no sense of pride in myself, but rather a deep-seated sense of shame that I could not shake. I've been digging into my past and childhood to try to find some kind of traume that could explain this. I wish someone had told me years ago that all this may have been cause by my drinking, and that all I had to do was to quit. But that is not a popular message.

Now, in the last 6 weeks, all of this has changed. I feel comfortable in my skin. I went to a work-meeting last week to negotiate the price and terms for an assignment. The exact kind of situation I would usually screw up. I didn't prepare much and I was able to just be myself and rely on my professional skills and personal charm. It was like I had become a different person.

There is so much more I could add to this. I'm able to deal with too much work without getting stressed and I feel ready and excited to take on new challenges and get on with making my dreams come through. I used to get up too late, which meant that my partner would have to take care of more than her share of the morning routine. Now I'm the first person to get up in the morning and prepare breakfast for my kid. 

For a lot of drinkers, there is a reason why they started drinking. A trauma or something painful that they're escaping. For them, quitting drinking may not solve these underlaying issues. But in my case, it seems as if the drinking was actually the root cause of a lot of other problems. I feel so lucky.",22,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4438556}"

It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

My experience in all of these meetings is that the structure of the meetings all seem to be the same. Either the meeting starts with a reading from a book or a meditation then it transitions into a discussion that seems to be a therapy session for people to discuss personal experiences and wins/struggles related to the topic for that meeting. I know these programs and meetings have been very beneficial to a lot of people so I'm not taking anything away from their significance in the sober community but it seems that all of the meetings are the same structure but just have different names. My counselors in rehab kept reinforcing the idea that meetings are a necessity for sobriety. I don't really personally feel that I am benefiting from any of the programs and meetings I have attended.

As far as how much I drank, like 10-14 shots over an evening/night pretty much every night. Earlier this year when I stopped I just recall that it sucked, but not the specifics - I had been in the hospital for something unrelated and had oxycodone for pain which I think alleviated things. I have people coming to town to visit/stay at my house tomorrow for five days - I decided to stop after Sunday because I don't want to be going through withdrawals while they are here. So I was wondering how in the clear I am - I had my last drink a little over 48 hours ago. Monday felt awful at work as usual, a little shaky, anxious, etc. Last night sucked, I just felt like I had a dark cloud over me and had to move or I'd freak out. I got less than five hours of sleep but felt better than when I'm hungover at work today and tonight I'm not shaky at all, but I do still feel that darkness over me a bit. Based on the amount I drank, do you think I should feel even better tomorrow and then by tomorrow night it will be 72 hours and I figure their company will distract me enough to make tomorrow night easy enough. Does that sound realistic? I read online about how worse symptoms can happen after 2-3 days, but it seems like that is for higher amounts of drinking than I did? I guess I'm just anxious (because I'm withdrawing haha) and am looking for some past experience, if things seem to get progressively better over two days is that usually a sign you're going to be in the clear in the next day or two?",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4431513}"

I was very engaged with my friends and doing things and planning things and just living. I felt so alive. 

The last couple of months have been a rock-bottom crash. I have faced so many hardships since getting sober - My grandfather who I loved and hadn't seen for more than a year died in a nursing home alone. I'm in a job I hate and I have to fight myself to get up every day. I've isolated myself from my friends and my family. I stopped exercising. I was smack in the middle between the Caldor Fire and the Dixie fire and even now, every night I pray that I don't wake up to sirens evacuating my small mountain town due to fires. The endlessness of COVID. Election anxiety. Working through a lot of really fucked up childhood trauma from being raised  by mentally ill parents. Some friends have showed up and some friends have been more fairweather. Some family has reached out, but I don't think anyone really knows how bad it is. 

I have never been prouder to stay sober in the face of all of this, it is the one positive thing I've got going right now, but it feels so impossible to get continue right now. I'm languishing and lost, trying to navigate a world built on quicksand. I'm trying to break generational trauma and grow into someone else, but I can't quite see that new person, and I'm trying to be kind to be myself and love myself, but I am so afraid I'm going to fuck it all up for myself. On paper, I've never been better, I've had such success with college and getting a livable paying job, but I feel so afraid and so alone. I'm always trying to be strong and supportive to my friends and family, because in the past I have been a burden to them. I wish someone would just wrap me in a blanket and take care of me and tell me they love me and are proud of me. I wish I could stop being so closed off and allow myself to be vulnerable enough to ask my family or my friends for help and support. 

I'm so sad, because I remember those glorious first few months, but that person seems so far away from me now.

I'm posting this to ask for any stories / experiences y'all have for dealing with very vivid dreams (sometimes nightmares) after quitting alcohol.

Today I am 242 days sober. Before these last few months, I don't think I had been sober for more than a couple of weeks in about 7 years. Quitting alcohol has been the hardest and most rewarding thing I've ever done. I can't tell you just how important of a role this community has played in that process.

Early in sobriety I did not sleep very much, which I was told was normal. Of all the symptoms of withdrawals the one that stuck around longest was super vivid dreams about me losing my sobriety, letting myself and others down. Recently these dreams have started back up again. The ""realness"" of the feeling of guilt that comes with these is a really tough thing to carry into the next day (or start my morning with).

I'm just wondering if anyone has had similar dreams? Did they happen after abstaining for this long? If so, any advice on how to cope would be much appreciated.

They have checked the bio markers in my blood 3 times now, I have no heart damage or indications of a heart attack. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced this as a result of alcohol withdrawal?  I find out tomorrow if they are going to go ahead and do a heart cath. I'm so glad I came in, otherwise I may not be here to write about it! I told the staff everything, they are still puzzled as to why it keeps spiking so high. Even if it is not related to withdrawal, it scared the shit out of me. I will not be drinking with you today and hopefully, one day at a time, in the future either!

I am a  26 y.o. male with a history of abuse tracing back to my teens. I don't need to go in depth about the abusive years; if you're here you've probably been through some hell of your own, but lately I was in a relatively good place about drinking. Or so I thought. I wouldn't need drinking daily, I don't have alcohol in the house at all and even when there was, I wouldn't go drink alone. But every time I'd go out, I wouldn't stop. Not until I'd spend all my money, the place was closing or everyone wanted to go elsewhere (where I'd keep drinking most of the time). I was unable to drink in moderation! It wasn't every day, it wasn't at home, it would not interfere with my life in obvious ways, but it was still taking its toll. Dry mouth, weight gain, lost mornings, all obvious signs, but it's the subtler ways that actually make this habit so destructive.  
Think about trying to get into a good habit, let's say daily meditation or exercise. You'll do it once, twice, thrice, but then it's Saturday and your drinking buddy's in town and wants to go out. Will you be excercising on Sunday? Naaah. Might even skip Monday, too. Tuesday... what was that about exercise again? And gone is the habit. As gone are many hours that I could use to do, well, anything else! I could have been studying, seeing new places (for me it'd be at least a return ticket/month, money-wise), doing activities, working on a business or my skills... Even just watching more movies would have been more beneficial.   
But instead I drowned the hours away.   
What alcohol has taken away is a better version of me. In return, it gave me a way to avoid looking at my problems.   
I can't get my time back, but I can make the most out of the time that I have left.",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.549335}"

I bought a bottle of alcohol free wine today because I feel like I would pour a drink at the end of the day because it was a habit (the first one). Then once the alcohol would hit, my ability to think rationally and say no to another was gone. So, tonight I poured a glass of this alcohol free wine to have with my dinner. Not bad tasting actually. But I felt a little comfort sipping it and it kind of eased my panic and desire to have alcohol. I know this is a bandaid and doesn't deal with the underlying condition but I'm thinking it might help me through the first couple of weeks and assist me in social situations until I have the coping skills I need.

I appreciate everyone and Ive been patiently waiting to make this post because geez I feel so much better and it's great. 

I gotta wake up early for work and that sucks a little bit less. I'm a little bit more clear-headed with decision making; and generally in a little bit of a better mood. I get in bad moods less frequently. A co-worker may have commented. This improves my outlook on that.

I've been more creative, with the way I speak and the way I think. I've been more creative at home on my instrument and with my general life habits and hobbies.  Nothing big but the stuff you need to live in normal life that doesn't depend on alcohol obsession. 

I still struggle with the habit of telling myself to eat at normal times, my subconscious is still waiting for the alcohol to come and I have to remind myself ""hey you can go and eat now and not do that ""late night blacked out binge messy kitchen thing"" you're famous for.. so that's interesting, I like food so this works for me. 


Family and friend relationships haven't really taken huge steps but a couple doors have been opened now with my month milestone and now 5 weeks.

Currently, I can pretty regularly string together multiple sober days but then I hit a bump, rationalize spending a night drinking, and have to start all over. I don't have any regretful actions while drunk, I mostly just don't remember whatever movie I watch or occasionally make a mess in the kitchen for tomorrow me to clean up. 

Today I emailed my incredibly absent and aloof boss to ask some questions about our next instruction block and found out I wasn't going to be hired back as I had failed to meet expectations I never knew I had.

The professionalism around fed grants is appauling and immediately I thought ""Well this deserves a drink.""

A friend was getting married, and we were throwing a bachelorette party, had the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner, and of course the wedding. There was absolutely no shortage of alcohol and many of my friends spent the weekend drinking. For the bachelorette party, when we went to a winery and I DD'ed I felt a little bit overwhelmed, especially with passing glasses down the tables and realizing all the alcohol I wanted - which I partially paid for - was just right there. It felt good to be the sober one, though, and approach everything calmly and peacefully, and not be the mess of a woman I used to be (throwing up in club bathrooms with no doors on the stalls, drinking wine hidden in my backpack in a train station, passing out in public bathrooms, I've done it all.) I still felt very awkward and desperately, desperately wanted a drink, but I did have fun and I got through it not much worse for wear. I was feeling good in the morning when everyone else was hurting and chugging Pedialyte and I was ready to go on a 5-mile hike. The wedding itself was easier than I anticipated - even though all my friends were drunk, I was happy and comfortable, and genuinely love the couple getting married so much that my happiness was better than what alcohol could ever bring me, and I love to dance alcohol or no alcohol. 

&#x200B;

But after the wedding, the other members of the wedding party wanted to go down to the nearby college town to party and drink. It was difficult to get there (remote, rural venue to the downtown bar) and many of us had carpooled, which, all to say, is that it took a lot of time for all of us to get down there, and all in waves. I ended up at this dive bar with a few not-close friends - I am much closer with the bride and a few of the other bridesmaids - so I didn't quite feel comfortable telling them how much I thought me being here was a bad idea. I had no easy way to get back to where we were staying - I could have figured it out, and I probably should have, but I still think that I can be the loud, bubbly life of the party I used to be instead of Just Me, who is more reserved and quiet and doesn't like big crowds and lots of noise. I was really overwhelmed, and as the waiter kept bringing vodka sodas to our table I wanted to drink more and more and more. A little after the bride and other bridesmaids arrived, I had to tell one of them that I needed to get out of there. They held my hands and sat outside with me until everyone had paid their tabs and was leaving to go to another, quieter, bar where I actually had a good time getting to talk to everyone without shouting and playing darts with the bride. I initially felt really bad about making everyone change plans, but the bride said that this was much more her vibe and she was having a much better time, and I felt a lot better about that. The groomsmen, who I don't know very well, were also very kind, and it was really refreshing to see. 

&#x200B;

I made it through and I made it through sober. I was tempted almost constantly, but the only one who is responsible for my sobriety is me. I am still learning what my boundaries are, and I think I need to work on my FOMO so that I can let my friends go to bars and do things that I know will trigger me so that they can have fun doing what they want to do and I can nuture my sobriety and honor what I need. I experienced some of the lowest lows and highest highs that trying to come through my alcoholism can give me this weekend. I just wanted to share that.

I've always been an anxious person with low self esteem. People were always confused why I was constantly feeling so bad about myself because I was in a good relationship, had a good job and was in good health. I can't explain why I feel this way. 

Unfortunately, several years ago, I began hanging out with new friends that were big drinkers. Suddenly I realized how much better I felt about myself when drunk, how much more confident I was. That's when I started day drinking and drinking at my job. Somehow I convinced myself this was okay because I wasn't exactly drunk - just buzzed.

Of course, this kept getting worse and worse but I think the most awful part was people around me watching me self-destruct. I was told numerous  times by family and friends that no good will come of this. That I am going to get myself into a heap of trouble and I - being a conceited ahole - just kept saying 'don't worry, I've got this handled'.

Time will no doubt have dulled the memory of the consequences we've faced and the horrors we've experienced. Euphoric recall will have made drinking seem more enticing. You will feel the pull of the romanticized drink so ubiquitous nowadays. You may even think enough time has passed you can control it.

Fuck all that. Listen to ME. If you could have A drink, I wouldn't be here again. One drink is NOT ok.

You know what else is not ok?

&#x200B;

It is NOT ok to be drinking half a 26 daily at work, then finishing it at home with beer.

It is NOT ok to have [this](https://imgur.com/a/6Uul5lK) many empties kicking around in your closet at any given time.

It is NOT ok to have half as many full bottles stashed around the house.

It is NOT ok to brush off dementia-like symptoms, abdominal pain, and whatever unholy abomination comes out of your ass daily (drinking shits suck).

It is NOT ok to lie to and steal from those closest to you, those who trust you.

It is NOT ok to spend such a ridiculously large chunk of your income on what you don't even enjoy anymore, on what's actively killing you.

It is NOT ok to only get 3 hours of sleep so you can get more drinking-alone time in.

It is NOT ok to have drinking as your only motivation.

It is NOT ok that you've lost relationships, jobs, opportunities, friends, possessions, dignity, memories, hobbies, and years of your life to this.

It is NOT ok to use drinking as a ""slow suicide"" you overly romanticizing woe-is-me fuck. If you're suicidal, you have a safety plan. USE IT, REACH OUT

Drinking will never be done with you until you're dead, way, way, after you're done with it.

Drinking is NOT ok.

&#x200B;

It IS ok to not be ok with this.

This will take a loong loong time to get over.

This has been your go to ""self-help"" for years, it will take years to re-establish better habits and coping mechanisms.

It IS ok to struggle, to be depressed, to despair, to be so bored you can't stand it. You do NOT need to self-medicate, you already take meds and drinking fucks with them (you know this man, c'mon).

It IS ok to cry, to be socially awkward, to have a void and not fill it, to fear missing out, to actually miss out.

It IS ok for people to think you're a prude or stuck-up or look down on you because you're an alcoholic. That's their business, not yours.   *""...That certain persons simply will not like you no matter what you do. Then that most nonaddicted adult civilians have already absorbed and accepted this fact, often rather early on.""* \-DFW.  Drinking won't help this, being confident in yourself will.

It IS ok to reach out for help, you are not a burden, take people up on their offers.

It IS ok to be angry. It is NOT ok for you to use that as an excuse for...      drinking: no,      shitty childish behaviour: no,      lashing out: no,      cutting yourself: no     .  Go scream into a pillow, run until you drop, punch a punching bag until it wins, make some really fucked up art. Drinking won't help these feelings, they'll come back with a vengeance or you'll hurt yourself again.

It IS ok to take time for yourself, burnout is not a badge of honour, drinking is not a reward. You are not your professional achievements.

It IS ok to make yourself vulnerable, to open up.

It IS ok if you get hurt by doing so. Some people are unaware, others are just dicks. That's just how it is. Drinking won't help that. Positive healthy relationships will, boundaries will, working on yourself will.

&#x200B;

Though it may not sound like it from the tone of my writing, I love you. I know shit is hard. I know you are doing your best. But drinking is no longer an option. Grieve, be angry, laugh at your past bullshit, feel what you need to feel to move on. When you can, stop focusing on what you can't do, go and do some cool new shit you wouldn't have been able to. Yes, it will feel like a massive loss, but you will have gained so much more.

Play it forward, take it moment by moment if you need to, and expect to hear from me again.

It wasn't easy. It was complicated, painful and very very slow at first. But the progress slowly started to pile up.

Eight and a half years later I wake up happy and free. Happy to have woken up, happy with my lot. I am still the guy that lied, cheated, stole and destroyed everything. But through (some) hard work and (mostly) the wisdom of those around  me my life is so much better. 

My gratitude fluctuates. I can still be depressive and melodramatic but with the tools I have been given I have the ability to not be like that if I so choose. Which I do with ever increasing regularity.

I only drink in the evening, I don't drink and drive or engage in any reckless drunken behavior, but if I am home alone I am unable to resist the temptation to drink. I have a very good career though I feel I am lazy and there are days I am not productive because I am hungover from drinking. I have a great relationship with my kids.

Rewinding the tape a bit and giving some back story, between the ages of birth and ten I moved homes roughly forty times bouncing between my grandparents in Wisconsin and my hippy parents that lived all over. It wasn‚Äôt until the age of ten that I lived in the same place for a year.

In times of stability (using this term very liberally, stabile meaning a roof over our heads) I lived with my parents and during instability like that time we lived in a teepee in Colorado when I was 3, I ended up with my grandparents. This went on for quite a while until my grandparents basically demanded parental rights cause my parents just sucked.

Worth noting, my dad was an intelligent man that came from a long line of doctors but he also grew up in the sixties. In his teen years he had zero interest in what was expected of him (undergrad at Dartmouth, medical school at Johns Hopkins as his father, grandfather and so on had done) namely becoming a doctor. Instead he went to Woodstock , later getting addicted to heroin and virtually everything else.

I had zero contact with my father from age ten until 28. Throughout high school I excelled academically but socially I struggled. I never had that core group of kids I'd grown up with so, I hung out with the drinkers, smokers and potheads. I smoked weed for the first time at 13 and drank that same year. While my drinking and pot smoking certainly paid their toll in some ways, it didn't stop me from graduating from high school a year early and earning a full academic scholarship. I lost that scholarship due to drinking too much and not taking my schooling seriously.

Flash forward to 2008, I'm 29 years old, married with a young boy. I woke up the night after the Packers suffered an embarrassing loss in the post season. Hungover again and had to get ready for work. At that time I was a lead stats analyst; I worked for the government. That morning, I‚Äôd said ‚ÄòI‚Äôm done for a bit‚Äô. I‚Äôd been thinking about taking a break seeing as I was overweight, doing coke occasionally yet working out but never seeing the results. With my 30th birthday on the distant horizon, I wanted to lose a little weight. Underlying it all, I had a problem I just hadn't admitted it yet and frankly, needed a couple days of clarity to start seeing clearly.

So as the days became weeks and the weeks became months I kept feeling better. I was sleeping better, my depression was dwindling, my self esteem improving, I‚Äôd recently started a business. I had so much that was improving in my life, it‚Äôs hard to keep track of it all.

I lost an incredible amount of weight going from almost 300 lbs (I don‚Äôt know what I weighed at my heaviest because I was scared to look) down to 180 lbs in 6 months. Over a hundred pounds in just 6 months.

Quitting wasn‚Äôt really a problem for me because in the beginning, I hadn‚Äôt said it‚Äôs forever, just for a while ‚Äú I‚Äôm taking a break‚Äù. My original plan was to quit drinking until I lost a bunch of weight and eventually having a big bash for my 30th birthday.

Well I spent my 30th birthday in an AA meeting. I wasn‚Äôt a regular there because I wasn‚Äôt a committed quitter initially. As such, that got a lot of rebuking in the halls of AA. Frankly, I hated AA - most of those crabby dudes annoyed me to no end.

I could go on and on but I‚Äôll spare you. Fast forward to today. I remarried the woman I‚Äôd divorced right after getting sober. I‚Äôve had tremendous personal, professional and spiritual victories in my life. While I not where I'd like to be, I'm much better than I once was and for that, Praise the Lord.

I know it seems impossible when you‚Äôre staring at a problem in your life to envision life without that crutch but it‚Äôs very much possible. In the beginning it will be moment to moment, day to day but one day, you'll realize you've quit counting.

Alcohol and drugs are voluntary chains of bondage we keep ourselves in. They seem appealing. They look attractive. They also drive our misery and it‚Äôs a circular problem unless you do something about it. I never thought I‚Äôd get victory over these things but here I am. One day at a time my friends.

I‚Äôve always had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol but I‚Äôve really spiraled out of control the last 18 months. My spouse and I ended a 10 year relationship in January 2020. Before we broke up my routine was to get home from work and drink about 6 beers over the course of the evening before bed. Once they moved out, Covid happened and I started working from home. Because I didn‚Äôt have to commute, 6 beers turned into 8 or 10 but I never started drinking before 5 because that was my way of validating my drinking and thinking I didn‚Äôt have a problem.

Somehow, over the course of the last 12+ months it‚Äôs turned into 10+ beers a day and 1 to 2 bottles of sparkling wine. I‚Äôve been drinking earlier and earlier in the day. Yesterday was really bad. On Sunday I passed out around 8pm after drinking all day, woke up at 1am and told myself I‚Äôd just have some wine to get back to sleep. Killed a bottle, passed out again, woke up late for a work call and started again. By 11 I was so tipsy that I was worried someone at work would catch me slurring my words so I said I had a migraine and logged off for the day, then of course proceeded to drink again all day.

I don‚Äôt know how I ended up here but I‚Äôm ready to stop. It‚Äôs only 9am and the thought of not drinking today is so overwhelming I‚Äôm trying to just take it in 5 or 10 minute intervals. But so far I‚Äôve been successful.

I rationalized for years that this was just a habit and became apart of me and how I identified myself. It helped me sleep. It helped me when I was stressed. I opened up more socially. After a long day, it helped me wind down. I could be more comfortable during sex.

But after a decade long (honestly longer) affair with my ""poison"" I realized this was all a lie. I hold the power within myself to give me these comforts. 

It has been a struggle and a lot of weak moments turning back to my old friend but surely after months of cutting back, once a week, twice a month, once a month I finally feel confident in myself to never look back. But it really is only one day at a time. 

I don't wake up hurting and canceling all plans. I don't have a panic wondering what I said, texted, posted and shaking while scrolling through messages only to delete them so I don't have to deal with it. No more apologies. I don't have the anxiety for days afterwards. I don't wake my husband up in the middle of the night. I remember movies. I have energy again and am actually doing things I have been wanting to do for years. 

To be honest, 2015 to 2020 was a blur. I have pictures that captured moments but I didn't really do anything. My money went to booze and sitting alone in my apartment in front of the tv. That isn't life. I find myself excited to smell my coffee in the morning. To smell the fresh air. Excitement to get out of the house. All things mundane I took for granted and now I cherish. I saw gray for a long time and now I see color. 

My point is. This fucking sucks and is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. Sure, I liked drinking otherwise I wouldn't have done it. But this is so much better. The drink lied to me. It does come to a point where we cross a line and what we once got out of it doesn't happen anymore. I can never moderate. I can never just have 1. My brain is rewired in a way now that I just can't. And you know what, that's ok. I never want to go back to that place just a few months ago when I was breaking down crying, feeling like I was crawling out of my skin and just wanting it all to be over because I felt like I couldn't be happy without my fix. It can get better. I know I'm still a newbie but I honestly thought that it would never just click for me. 

Keep trying. That's why we are here right? We want a change. We want better for ourselves. It's out there and it is right there in us all.

I have had a bad relationship with alcohol for a number of years but thank fully I have never descended into the territory of drinking very heavily every single day. However, when I do drink it's heavily for 2-3 days (straight vodka usually) which tends to cause me mild withdrawal symptoms when I stop and taper it. I will get anxiety, brain fog and insomnia but haven't ever experienced any shakes or anything like that. I will then maybe repeat this once every 2 weeks to once a month, however it's definitely doing something to me as I've noticed the recovery seems to worsen each time.  


It's something I really don't like doing as I'm otherwise very healthy and do a lot of physical training and even manage to get great workouts done during the withdrawals I've experienced.

I had one such incident this weekend in which after a day or so of stopping my body broke out in these really nasty looking hives on different areas of my body about a day or so ago. It's particularly bad on the backs of my legs. They were the worst they've been this morning but I sweated a hell of a lot during the night and really struggled to sleep. I've experienced this before as the alcohol works it's way out of my body, but never the hives. It was quite concerning. I bought some antihistamine medication which has really helped it since.

I think I may have made my body allergic to alcohol due to the binges, combined with the fact I have a moderate diet and only tend to eat the same types of foods daily. So, I think it comes as a massive shock to my system. I've also noticed that after the first night/day of drinking I tend to wake up with a really blocked and stuffy nose which I also think is part of an allergic reaction.

I would go to the store, pick up a bottle or two of wine, drive home, begin drinking, make dinner, sometimes manage a shower (sometimes not) and then pass out on the couch at an early hour - only to wake up the next morning wishing it was tomorrow.

So let's read, I think instead of trying not to drink first a person should work on the issues which triggers us to drink like for me it was inferiority complex , helplessness, minor inconvenience with friends, failure in career or exam. Identify issues and that can be done by being honest with yourself, don't lie to yourself and you have made very great progress already trust me it's really big thing to be honest with yourself. 
So get a therapist or very good friend of yours or even social media friend probably best if you talk that with someone who had the drinking problem and recovered, higher chances that they will understand you Talk with great honesty .
Most important part so is the company of people you live with , you know friends and all. Recognise the bad influence it's really ok , good and best to limit them from your life , do it thank me later.

I'm worried that she might have early onset. This wasn't just her being drunk and confused. She would seem to absorb what I was saying but then it would just... slip away. She's only in her 50s, but I think her drinking has finally caught up with her mind in a more detrimental way than it has so far. 

It's so tragic to watch people waste their minds and bodies, trapped by such a socially encouraged way.

I'm so tired of this.,"For fuck's sake, it just feels like it's ""a new low"" every other week. I was doing okay and then I basically just ruined the tiny bit of progress I did make, all because of my poor impulse control and inability to deal with stress.

After breaking up with my ex I had to move back home with my mum a few years back which is depressing enough on its own aside from the fact she has extreme issues with control and dealing with her emotions, flies off the handle at the slightest mundane thing that isn't even important. She cannot handle me having any different opinions to her, yesterday was one of those times.

I had a job interview today and a friend got me a bottle of wine to either celebrate or commiserate (who doesn't know I was trying to stop) and I'd done so well not touching it, but one of my mum's fits of ridiculous uncalled for rage just sent my anxiety through the roof and I drank it.

And then went out and bought two more, and drank those as well. It's not my mum's fault, it's mine alone, but she really doesn't make anything easy. Not having a job is depressing too. I've been saving so much to be able to move out and live alone, so I've bought absolutely nothing outside of absolute essentials this year, alcohol being the only thing I've really spent on and my god I don't even want to think about how much it must add up to by now.

I woke up early this morning from the dreaded thirst we all know about, to notice I hadn't even set an alarm for my interview. I did - very luckily - have enough time to jump in the shower and get ready and attend, I think it actually went okay but all I could think about was ""I know I look okay but do they know?"" ""No way I'm getting this, look how more well prepared these other people are than me. They aren't fuck ups like me."" I mean, really, how ridiculous is all that? A job, which I've wanted for so long, and the day before I have a chance at getting one that doesn't even work to stop me drinking.

I'm tired of feeling jealous of people who manage to stay sober.

I'm tired of wasting money on something that doesn't even make me happy, not really, when I could be saving so much more to achieve my goals sooner. I *need* to get out of my current living situation for my own sanity and drinking is actively hindering me and holding me back.

I'm tired of feeling ""less than"" everyone else.

The latest version of this was over the summer when I had a few beers while on holiday, which started out ok.  I wasn't getting drunk but felt chilled and like it was adding to my holiday.  But then once home I was back to thinking of reasons to drink or pop the pub.  \_EVERY\_ evening meal needed a good bottle of wine and it was starting to spiral. 

I got complacent.  It's so important to remember this is a life long decision for a reason.

So here I am, back at 2 weeks sober focusing on the attitude of being grateful for continued sobriety and what it brings to my life.

One of the things over the years that always snaps me back is this post, for me it should be in the greatest hits of this sub.

Yesterday I had to console my daughter who is living with her mothers family, having to explain to her why mama and papa no longer live together. I have always tried to be there for her as any good father should, support her emotionally and financially but obviously missing the physical element. This is rough on both parties but I hope she understands the reasons why I'm here and why she is there.

The Ex and I both went through an extremely stressful time that no parent should ever have to go through. Due to the latter, I started drinking heavily and I wasn't ever going to be truly happy in the marriage. We got divorced a long time ago and haven't seen each other for many years but we talk to each other anytime we talk with our daughter. 

But, a few weeks ago the ex-wife started to use my daughter as a tool, she had previously used my daughter to emotionally blackmail me into staying with her, the term 'stay together for the kids' and that it will never work is case in point. I don't know what started to possess my ex into thinking that we could get back together. In an upset rage when I said that there is nothing left but our daughter she called or messaged my daughter stating that Papa is going to take you away from me and other nonsense which made my daughter distraught! I couldn't believe it!

New to Reddit today, been lurking on this page for a month or so and am 7 days sober so far. Started binge drinking as a teen, but really noticed it becoming a daily habitual part of me in my mid 20's and it just progressed more and more until reaching stupid levels since Covid began... a sip in the morning to get over the hangover, a glass before the zoom call, a glass after the zoom call. Then a bottle in the evening after somehow getting through the working day.  

Was curious to know from you all (especially those who quit and had no serious withdrawal/detox symptoms) whether the fear of the withdrawal actually hindered and prolonged you being able to quit. For me, once I actually stopped drinking I had no withdrawal symptoms - not even a headache. But for such a long time the fear of a seizure and all the things I'd read, kept me from quitting - I kept trying to just taper by having a drink or a shot, but it always led me to drinking a bottle or two and the cycle kept repeating. 

Just been wondering how many of us this has happened to and somewhat compelled us to continue drinking due to a state of fear of what may happen? 

I wish I had gone cold turkey sooner and pushed my anxiety of withdrawal away, because I could've been so much further down the path of recovery/sobriety - but happy to be here all the same.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or have been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Just 3 months prior to the blood test, everything was fine, then everything wasn't...

In my teens I suffered from alcoholism pretty heavily. To eat I had to drink, to drink I had to eat. I'm not a social drinker, so I wasn't out causing any trouble or anything, but it impacted me in a number of ways. Even with alcohol poisoning, I was drinking less than 24 hours after recovering. 

Eventually one night I was tired of constantly drinking (some days as early as 6am), and decided that I couldn't keep on. With what oddly intense willpower I had at the time, I succeeded and ended up not drinking for over 2 years. The first month was torture, and I was a total asshole...But after that, I got used to not drinking.

Obviously, I'm not a teen anymore, and I now have much more stressful things on my plate (like the pandemic). At the beginning of the pandemic I was battling a very intense addiction, but it was ultimately stopped by the constant monitoring of my family. Alcohol is different though. It isn't anyway near as unsafe as what I had been doing, and pretty much everyone in my family drinks daily...So, quitting that was much different.

I hadn't had any alcohol problems since my teenage years. More often than not I'd not be very interested in drinking. My ex-gf and friends could be drinking and I'd be uninterested, smoking a bowl while they drank.

After I got over my addiction issue last year from a different substance, I fell back into drinking. Traded one bad habit for another, simply put. My drinking quickly reached the point of addiction. A half gal of vodka or gin only lasted me about 2-3 days at its worst, which is a bit much, given I'm small both in height and weight. Due to my high tolerance (always been that way) I end up drinking far more than someone my size because it takes at the very least a few shots before I feel it. 

At the start of the year, when my drinking was getting pretty rough, I had a blood test and everything was fine, but after 3 months of heavy drinking and another blood test, things were pretty bad. Went from having nearly perfect blood work to having multiple things that were bad. Doc said it was fatty liver, which explained my fast weight gain and bad blood work (was size 28-34 for like a decade, that changed fast). 

I'm at a point where I want to get back to my old self. I want to have my normal body back (I'm not used to being overweight), and I don't want to feel the need to drink constantly. At the same time, stress and such tends to push me back to drinking.

I try to keep myself occupied and less stressed so I won't drink, but it is difficult to go more than a day or two without. I've been doing coding projects, working on certifications, reading, writing, drawing, exercising, cleaning, some gaming here and there, all kinds of stuff really. Even with all that, like an itch I can't scratch, the urge to drink is there. 

I'd like to be the way I was when I didn't care about alcohol. When others could drink around me and I had no interest. When I'd say no to someone asking me to drink with them because I simply didn't want to drink. Despite me wanting to be a normal person who does not crave alcohol, I can't stop craving it. 

Right now my main goal is to hit a 2 week mark and then 1 month. 1  week seems to do very little in terms of cravings. I feel like it'll take at least 2 weeks to a month to get the cravings to go away some. 

So, what are some of the things you did to push through the first hurdle? The first hurdle of course being the amount of time it takes to get rid of the intense cravings.

Did you find anything that reduced your cravings, such as simply letting yourself relax, or was it by staying busy? Did certain activities work better than others? 

&#x200B;

It was posted to r/stopdrinking by u/creaturefeature16. It's a refreshing reminder of what some of the beauty in our journey to become sober entails.,"Originally posted by u/creaturefeature16:

 

I've been with the SD community for over a year now and something that keeps me coming back is the enthusiasm and jubilation that the community expresses, especially over what many might consider to be really basic elements of daily life; taking walks, reading, a good cup of tea, spending time with family, good sleep, exercise, productivity...the list goes on. We gush over these experiences and share with each other the beauty we find in the simple and wholesome (and I'm in the same boat). It might seem a little odd to an outsider...like, what's the big deal?

It got me thinking...why **is** this the case with so many of us? And I realized: this rivals the behavior of someone who's regained their freedom again from being held captive for a long, long time. But the thing is, we didn't think of ourselves as being held captive. We chose to enter into a relationship with our addictions and over time they slowly began to take more and more freedom from us, until we were ""shackled"" and locked up. And then it was too late to easily get away, so we had to stay.

And after long enough, we no longer saw our addictions as our captors at all, but rather began to identify with them. Want them. Need them. Even ""love"" them! They weren't our captors, they were our best friends, our saviors even. They rescued us from the mundane, from the trivial. Do they hurt us? Yes, sometimes...but it's *only* because we did something wrong. And when we strayed too far, we ran back again and again, because the thought of living life without them was too difficult to imagine. They were the reason we were maintaining in the first place, and without them, we wouldn't survive or have joy ever again.

**Until one day,** we saw through the facade. We realized that our captors, our addictions, that we thought were holding the very keys to our happiness, were actually preventing it. And we broke free. And we got away...far enough away where we finally felt safe from them. And now...we're vulnerable, but so amazed with everything we had been missing. Food tastes better. Music sounds better. The cool breeze on our skin lights up every nerve ending to the point where it's almost too much to take. And the gratitude we feel from having escaped that twisted relationship and self-imposed prison is expressed throughout our daily lives, throughout this community.

Yes, we celebrate the basics, because for so very long, we were being held back from enjoying them. We were being dulled and diminished to where all we could focus on is being with our captors. But, now we're free (or getting free) because we see them for who they really are. And it feels ***incredible***. üéâ",42,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49332836}"

Was anxious all morning. Today I would finally answer ""How many drinks on average do you consume per week?"" **honestly**. I used to stretch across 7 days the amount I would binge in 24-48 hours, just so it didn't look quite as awful. I'd also miscount doubles (or triples). Hell, like I could even remember the actual number if I didn't have a receipt from the bar.

Quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done. And I still have thoughts or ideations frequently, just not strongly. 

Yet probably the single biggest support I've had is visiting this group and just scanning through post very, very regularly. 

Reading the experiences - the struggles and triumphs - across the spectrum of people helps immensely. 

* Knowing an empathizing with the person who's on minute or hour one, let alone day one, has made me a far more compassionate, understanding and accepting person. 

* Reading the old timers, the people with 10,000, 20,000, even 30,000 days sober provides so much hope and inspiration that I can model, and ultimately become them, with my choice each day. 

* And the most heartbreaking, yet impactful for me, are those who have experienced a relapse after many years of sobriety. Because I've actually experienced this in my past, too. So I can empathize and relate, very strongly. 

And it's the single biggest punch between the eyes, that sobers me up and brings me back to reality so to speak, when any type of romanticizing or ideation is happening within me subconsciously. And then both playing the tape forward, but also playing the tape backwards, and remembering the absolute pain, misery, despair and personal hell I was in in the years weeks and even day before I ultimately quit alcohol. 

This group has been an absolute godsend. And I'm grateful to you all. 

I wish you all health, happiness and true self-love and acceptance.

Every time I pick up a drink it's a massive risk at this point, not just to myself and not just to my health. I blackout after around 3-4 drinks since starting antidepressants recently, yet I've been continuing to drink more than that on a regular basis, inducing repeated blackouts.

Yesterday I got wasted at a festival, took a pill given to me by someone I'd only just met (so reckless and stupid - I know!) and then blacked out, with only bits and pieces of memory to go by up until the point where I ""came to"" this morning, just as I was being kicked out of a stranger's house...in a city I don't even live in, might I add (experienced arguably the worst train journey of my life today, nursing a comedown/hangover combo while wearing yesterday's beer-and-sweat-soaked clothes). I could argue that on this occasion the pill made me blackout, as opposed to the alcohol, but I'd just be kidding myself. If it was pure mdma, I've taken that without alcohol many a time and never blacked out from it before. If it was something else or cut with anything, I guess it could've contributed, but that's besides the point really as I wouldn't have even taken the pill if I was making rational, sober decisions!

As much as I should, I don't necessarily worry about bad things happening *to me* while I'm blacked out. My anxiety always revolves around bad things *I* might do or say while intoxicated. I know I can get pretty flirty when drunk and can also be kinda bad at reading signals - what if I were to do something sexually with someone without gaining their consent? If both parties are blackout drunk, can proper consent even be obtained? These kinds of thoughts haunt me so much that every blackout is followed by weeks of ""What if I did this? What if I said that?"", usually with no way of finding out either way, as I tend not to have anyone able to reliably fill in the gaps (went out alone/lost my friends at some point/everyone else was equally trashed and blacked out too/etc.)

I'm only 25, but I feel like I'm getting too old to be this much of a trainwreck all the time. I might recount these stories in a jokey way after the fact, making out like blacking out is all part of the fun, but the reality is that blacking out is god-awful. It's not cool or funny, it's absolutely terrifying. I can't keep accepting this risk. And it's a risk even when I promise myself *It'll be different this time...* I've lied to myself too many times about being able to moderate. Sure, sometimes I can - it's not completely inevitable that once I start I won't stop. But it's way more frequent than the sensible alternative of knowing when to stop, or having ""just one or two"". Even when I do successfully moderate, it makes me pretty miserable, because I inevitably want more so then I feel like I'm depriving myself. 

I hate that I keep hitting new levels of ""rock bottom"", then a few days later I'm back to picking up the damn shovel again. How much deeper do I have to go? Do I have to do something horrific and unforgivable - or irreversible - to finally say enough is enough, and truly mean it? Or will some sort of health complication catch up to me first? I may be young, but my liver must already be pretty battered from several years of heavy near-daily drinking. I'm too scared to get tests to confirm just how bad the damage is.

I don't like what alcohol has turned me into. At worst, a genuinely terrible person. At best, broke and boring, since drinking is pretty much my only hobby. I'm certain that I used to be more creative and intelligent and interesting than this, but nowadays my brain is constantly submerged in hangover fog. Drinking takes up time and money that could be spent on being productive, engaging in meaningful hobbies or just... watching TV, but sober enough to actually remember what I watched the next day??? 

As I said, this isn't my first post here nor will it be my first attempt at sobriety. It's been well over a year since I first started to identify as a ""problem drinker"", and all that's happened in that time is that my drinking has become gradually more problematic. But I'm tired and anxious and so so sick of it all. A sober life has to be better than this.

I was driving through my boring urban neighborhood in my sedate middle-aged lady car, feeling a certain four-days-booze-free-but-still-anxious vibe, and I thought, ‚ÄúThis whole sobriety thing would be soooooo much better with some Rush!‚Äù So I dropped my car into sport mode and played Moving Pictures as I headbanged my way home to Limelight.

It‚Äôs really hard to have a good automotive headbang session when you‚Äôre either drunk or hungover every day. I‚Äôm a fairly cautious driver, but I know there were times when I was close to .08. The last thing I wanted was to cultivate the attention of the cops by thrashing about behind the wheel as I rocked out to Ministry. So I would quietly slink the backroads listening to NPR, and if I was concerned I was over the limit, I would Uber.¬†Never once have I had a Uber or Lyft driver playing metal, punk, etc, so I kind of assume carshare services are a no headbang zone.

I also got my headbanging curbed by the near daily migraines triggered by wine, and the dizziness that comes with dehydration. Who wants to whip their hair around to Metallica when Lars Ulrich‚Äôs drums aren‚Äôt nearly as loud and incessant as the pulsing blood vessels in your head?¬†

My sobriety is fragile, but the bands I like are not. From this day forth, I shall beat a happy headbanging path through this boozeless life. Who‚Äôs in with me? What music brings out your sober headbanger? ü§òüèªüé∂ü§òüèª

Just thought I'd share with people who understand and appreciate what that means. I'm blessed and proud to share this day with all of you.

At first I thought I only had an addiction to weed (smoked 7 years nonstop), and that alcohol wasn't a problem for me because I didn't drink it all the time and really didn't care much for the taste (despite nearly always having a negative experience after drinking). I managed to quit weed but pretty much turned to alcohol and ended up replacing one substance for another. Well, I ended up getting a DUI and this was a wake up call (rock bottom if you will) that really made me reflect and reconsider my relationship to alcohol. I decided to stop drinking on or around New Years Eve of 2018.

I'm not going to lie to you. My life is by no means perfect, and I still struggle with some of the same issues I did 1,000 days ago and more, but it's immeasurably better than it was when I was abusing substances and numbing and escaping life through substance abuse. I struggle with a plethora of mental health issues, but now I am able to face them with clarity. Regardless of the problems I face, I can face them without the additional problems that alcohol brings and be thankful for my sobriety. I feel for each and every one of you struggling with addiction.

The last 1,000 days have been filled with some big ups, and some low downs. None of the ups would've happened had I been drinking, and no matter how bad things got, I am thankful to have been sober through it all. I have had many ups directly related to sobriety (see plenty of other people's posts for benefits), but no downs directly related to it.

For some reason, I've always liked to get drunk. I can't remember a time when I just got buzzed. I've had some periods when I drank less, especially end 2019, first half 2020, but I feel that since the summer of 2020 I've been consistently drinking a lot. Last month I managed, for the first time since I don't know when, to go 17 days without drinking because I had an extremely important deadline and really locked myself away. I was actually surprised and proud that I managed to not drink for so long and the longer I didn't drink, the less I felt like it. Yet, the day I finished the deadline I got drunk in the evening with friends and since then it's been a lot. Like, I don't drink when I'm alone (I went on a week-long solo trip this month and had 1 glass of wine the entire time I was there) but when I'm with others I just have no boundaries whatsoever. I've been in denial for a long time because actually being honest about what alcohol is doing to my life, is extremely difficult and painful. I lose keys, my phone, I take drugs without knowing what they are, I black out really often, I waste so much time being hungover, I spend so much money,...

It's so difficult to talk about this with my friends because some of them are clearly drinking problematically as well and avoid the conversation, whereas others do not seem to struggle with moderation and don't really get where I'm coming from. And it's difficult because alcohol plays such a big part in my life: I'm a social, single 20-something living in a big city in a country where alcohol is extremely pervasive. I wouldn't really know how to handle the boredom I think will be part of a life without alcohol.

How do you handle the craving and establish new patterns?,"First post here, let me know if anything is against the rules or normal discourse. I want to drink less or maybe stop completely. Over the last 2 years I have went from drinking occasionally socially to drinking frequently (on average 3-5 nights a week) at home. This is partially in tandem with stopping cannabis use after regular use for years due to work (which served the same purpose as drinking does for me now). I am at the point where if I start I normally drink a 6 pack of 8% ABV beers (I think I need to hear more how that is actually a lot, I feel like it doesn't even hit me that much anymore). The first one gives the endorphin rush, then I basically feel like I am chasing that feeling of the first beer until I get tired and fall asleep. I think it is also worth noting my mom had (has I guess) alcohol use disorder pretty bad (like drinking straight vodka on the way to work every day) for several years when I was in grade school (she has been sober for 7 years now) and there is lots of substance use issues in my family.

My trigger is that the work day is over. I have a semi-dread feeling about having to do work tomorrow because I don't like my job (I have another one lined up, but likely wont start for 3-6 months). I had a injury a few years ago that has limited my ability to exercise and play sports (something that used to be a big filler of taking my mind of stuff and getting those endorphins going). I crave getting to that place of not caring. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I think that plays into struggling to relax without substance use. I don't really know how to break the cycle. My brain is saying if you don't drink tonight you will have to make it through another day before you get that option again. I know I will feel bad tomorrow and regret it, but I can't tap into that emotion enough to not want to drink now.

I don't have a specific question, I am just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and what helped you break the loop. I want to quit because I am afraid of what doing this long term will do to my health and because I don't think it is a good solution to how I feel, but I just don't know where to start.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65558964}"

This morning I was scheduled to go back to St. Croix for work. I was there last week but came home over the weekend for my daughters birthday. My stress was already at an all time high due to me failing my wife/marriage, as well as knowing I was going to be at the airport, in the Admirals Club where I could be drinking for free before my flight just like I‚Äôve been doing for the past five years. But as I got to the airport, my wife called me to tell me that our daughter was sick. She had thrown up in her sleep and wasn‚Äôt feeling very well. No biggie, I thought. Keep her home from school and take her over to the local urgent care and all should be fine. But it wasn‚Äôt fine. 

By the time I got through security and to the lounge, my wife called me again to say that my daughter will not stop throwing up and has now turned blue from her head to her feet.

And after a few hours in the ER, my baby got to go home and is taking a nice, long nap. 

I did it. It‚Äôs only 4 days, but two of my biggest drinking triggers were conquered today. And tomorrow, I will be back at the airport‚Ä¶not drinking. It‚Äôs a great feeling.

I started drinking at 22 back in India. At 28, I came to Berlin. 

Europe in general has this culture of drinking. For the initial few years, I drank once in 3-4 days. Since last couple of years, I drink once in a week (mostly on a weekend). Its usually 2-3 glasses of wine or beer. 

However, I have noticed that my apetite for drinks has gone down. Meaning, I get way more tipsier in 2-3 glasses of wine than I used to, few years back. Also, the hangover has become stronger. I don't feel like getting up in the morning. Of course age is a factor. But in general, I have started to believe that for a night of fun (which honestly isn't that fun anymore), I sacrifice the entire next day. 

I have been thinking to quit for a while now. There have been times when I didn't drink for 2-3 months (the last it happened was when I went to India in April, 2021). 

But being in Berlin, where people drink beer like water, its a little difficult. And there are so many parties happening around literally everyday. 

I have tried to divert my attention. For example, I now have a bachata class at 7:30 PM Saturday. So I don't get wasted on Friday because I know I have a class on Saturday. But then Saturday after class, usually I ping my friends and almost everytime they are out.

I think its high time I should stop this shit. Any suggestions on my situation would help. I don't know if I should completely stop going out. But I am an extremely sociable guy and that would hamper me. So not sure what to do.

For example, one friend said, ""so you're going to only lay off of drinking until Halloween, right?"" 

Anyways, I'm handling it fine, but just needed somewhere to vent about it. I've always been the ""fun drunk guy"" but at the expense of my health, sleep, and overall well-being. They saw me at my best, but not when I would get home and continue drinking alone until the early morning hours while chain smoking cigarettes.

Over the last 12 years I‚Äôve been every kind of drinker out there, but the past 2 years I‚Äôve structured my drinking into binge sessions a couple hours before I went to bed.

That night I poured the rest of a handle of gin down the drain.  I was only able to sleep about 3 hours that night.  Last night I struggled for 10 hours to stay asleep.

I spent the afternoon giving my bathroom some much needed cleaning love. Finishing up the cleaning and 1/2 bottle of wine as the sun set. Infrequently, instead of sedating me, drinking will stimulate me, energizing my brain/thinking, I find this very pleasant and that's what happened last night. I was really happy with my bathroom and started planning upgrades - new towels, organizing, etc. I was out of wine so I started on the vodka that's been sitting in around for a few years. Decided I'd paint the grout in my shower (yes - you read that right). After watching a few how-to videos, I started the job around 10pm.  Did one wall and liked it but the vodka was gone and it was 1am so I went for a tequila and soda. Don't really like tequila so I stopped drinking after one, but I was up until 4am working on the damn shower tile. 

My hangover is epic and I'm going to spend the day finishing the grout and re-cleaning my bathroom because there's paint everywhere. I'm retired, live alone and have a great, fun life. Except for wine drinking I take really good care of myself, eat well and am lucky enough to have no health issues at all.  

I'm not sure what triggers it, but this is the 3rd time in my life I've done this, stayed up painting something almost all night while drinking. The last one time was over 20 years ago and the time before that was probably 35 years back. Both of those times, I was horribly ashamed and immediately repainted.

I just said ""I don't drink anymore, i've had my fair share in life"", and they all just stopped and said Good for you man, you are more than a man than I am. This completely through me off!

This is my first post on this sub though I‚Äôve been lurking for quite some time. I‚Äôve been drinking since I was 17 (now 34) and for the longest time never thought I had a problem. Everyone drank: my family, my friends, my coworkers. 
I used to blackout once in a blue moon. As I got older, and drank more, the blackouts became more frequent. The inexcusable behavior became more frequent. The drunken calls and texts, the bad decision making and mornings full of regret became more frequent. Over the course of my life drunk I‚Äôve done some pretty horrible things.
I hit a very scary low in 2019. I was drinking every day. Suicidal thoughts filled my mind on a daily basis. I was screaming inside for help. Too proud to look into therapy or search for support. Then I got pregnant.
I honestly think that getting pregnant with my son was divine intervention. I sobered up and went to the doctor for the first time in years. Ended up getting diagnosed with a fatty liver. Told myself that I was done. I held out for a long time. When my son was about 10 months old I started drinking regularly again. I think we can all assume that this decision did not go over well. 
I started sliding down that slippery familiar slope all too quickly.
Now my drinking is almost as bad as it was before and I‚Äôm scared. I want to be a better example for my daughter, and actually be here to see my son grow up. I want to be here for my babies. I don‚Äôt want to go back to being that person. But at the rate I‚Äôm going, if I don‚Äôt stop, that won‚Äôt be possible.
Having a spouse that abuses alcohol as well makes things even more difficult. I have had 100 day ones this past year. I‚Äôm hoping this will be my last. Something inspired me to post on here today, though I‚Äôve wanted to do it for quite some time. Just looking for support and positive vibes. I‚Äôve read so many inspirational stories on this sub.

Question for those of you struggling with handling mental illness alongside sobriety.,"2020 and 2021 were full of some of the hardest months, decisions, situations, and internal struggles that I have ever faced. Over the last few months, I've come to realize just how much I was using alcohol as a means to cope and self-medicate for mental illness I thought had been handled and tucked away (for the most part.)

(Preface) I was diagnosed as a child (6-7 years old) with severe generalized anxiety disorder and they also tossed in a side of panic disorder and depression as well. Never had any major issues with drugs or alcohol until my early 20's, after a bad breakup, when I started to drink somewhat heavily at least 2-3 nights a week.)

Between then and now, I've had my share of sober months as well as getting drunk 5+ nights a week for months on end. This last decision of sobriety has taken a stronger hold, due to my growing concern for the physical (and mental) damage that the last 5-ish years of drinking have caused.

ANYWAYS! While I've had my bouts of anxiety and depression here and there over the years (I got some really great treatment in pre-teenhood that kept me healthy and off of meds) but have had control over everything since then. Sober or not. Though it is arguably much easier to keep things in check when I'm not hungover. This last time however, it seems like my drinking was drawn out just long enough to unravel all of the work that I did as a kid with CBT and neurofeedback training. I'm back to waking up anxious every morning and my depression swings in and out, sometimes as harsh as it has ever been. I'm in the process of getting connected with another mental health professional (easier said than done in CA, especially with Covid still rampant enough to impact all levels of treatment availability.) but I'm curious to hear any/all of your experiences with regard to this topic.

How many of you had your mental health totally in-check and under control before you started drinking, only to end up pushing too far past the edge and undoing all said work/progress?

Did I break my brain?

Over the last 4 months I started drinking again thinking I had control.

It started with  a glass of wine with dinner when we went out , or having a beer when we were watching something. Just me and my wife.

As I was drinking again , a recent meal out with friends turned into a very drunken event ( I encouraged allot of shots ) and resulted in me trying to take my clothes off when we returned to the friends house before going home. I woke up with a bad hangover , but the behaviour was laughed off and so I thought I was ok.

Over the next couple of months my drinking increased , I stopped ordering my non alcoholic beer and ordered wine a few times a week.

Yesterday we had a family wedding I was in charge of filming some videos. I started drinking as soon as we got there , but I wanted to get some good footage so I was busy too. However once the evening party came I went full force, wine , beer , shots.... , I smoke when I drink/drunk so was outside bothering people for smokes and talking like an idot as I'm 37 and drunk me thinks I'm 22. I interact with people in such an over the top way it makes me cringe to think what those people think of me.l ( I think I would have been punched if it wasn't a wedding).

I ended up having to be taken to bed by a family member (who I'm sure likes me even less) after I started trying to rap ( kill me).

So that was two days ago and I still feel really hungover, I'm quitting drinking again and doing it for me because the bottom line is no one else cares , I'm sure I've made such a bad impression to some people and even after the 2 years off , I'm sure they still didn't like me anyway.

Bottom line here is do not start drinking again, even after years , you just behave the same and feel the same eventually. I was so sad that day two years ago and now I'm sad again.


****** Update ******

Thanks for all you're lovely comments and messages, I'm on day four of the hangover and still feel sick and depressed, guess this is withdrawal as I was keeping myself topped up with drinks each night leading up , but  I know it will pass and there is no way I'm drinking again. If I'm honest too I don't have any friends or family (on my side)  ( the friends above are my wife's) so happy to make connections, I'll be now checking in on this community daily to help me.

I'd like to thank this sub. I wouldn't be anywhere close to this far without it.

I was a high functioning alcoholic.  Right around 6 drinks a day, nearly every single day for years (15 years? I'm really not sure when it got to this level).  Only occasionally more than that and probably about once every couple weeks I'd take a day or two off if it were inconvenient to go to the store.  Once or twice a year would black out.  



My experience has not been quite like all the inspirational posts I see daily on this sub.  Getting sober has *NOT* done any of the following for me:

* Given me tons of energy. I'm still very tired every day, and I feel old (I'm 45), but I do feel moderately better than when I drank.
* Cured my depression. I'm still depressed, but my mental health and temper are better overall.
* Inspired/enabled me to get in shape.  I still don't exercise, even though I know it would make me feel a lot better.
* Cleaned my house. I'm still a slob. I really expected this to get better just due to not having empties piling up, but somehow it has not.  

But here's what getting sober *HAS* done for me:

* Saved my marriage.
* I've lost a lot of weight. Pretty much where I want to be at this point in my life (now only if I could start exercising). 
* Eliminated/reduced a lot of risky behavior. I didn't drink and drive, but did do a lot of stupid shit while drinking. 
* Fixed my sleep. I fall asleep and stay asleep much better now.  I also used to have night terrors, and those are 99% gone.   

If you're two weeks in and have the urge to say, ""fuck it, I miss the buzz"", just hang in there and get some sparkling water the next time you're shopping instead of your drink of choice.  One day you won't miss the buzz, and you'll look at a bottle like it's a guaranteed recipe for a morning headache, acting stupid/embarrassing, and getting fat; all with *NO* upside.  

Onward to 10,000.

I‚Äôve spent the last week in my room constantly drinking. Only leaving to go buy more beer from the shop. Didn‚Äôt eat. Hardly slept. 

My room was littered with cans and bottles. When I did sleep I woke up in a hot sweat. I‚Äôd have another drink to numb me out. Only to wake up an hour later and repeat. My heart felt like it was beating at 100mph and at one point I thought I might be having a heart attack. I‚Äôm 24. And I thought my life was in trouble, so I drank some more. 

I then finish a bottle of whiskey which knocked me out for a good half a day. I woke up and had an ‚Äúout of body experience‚Äù so to speak.

It's been a while since I've posted and likely that's half the reason I am where I am now. 

I know it's not an excuse but so much has happened the past month that my life was turned upside down and I caved. I caved hard. The saddest part is, is that I didn't care if I over did it.

Now the good news.. I am back and I am alive and no one was hurt (at least physically) with my selfish downward spiral. I am done - time to go back to how I was and how I felt when I was 6 months sober.

After 9 months of sobriety, I felt curious as to whether or not I could drink in moderation.

Moderation simply does not work. And you know what? It takes a tremendous amount of work to remember my rules, justify reasons for bending them, and grieving my failures the following day.

I recognized I had a problem with alcohol almost as soon as I started drinking and I spent 25 years spiraling, trying to quit, giving up on trying, trying again, and barely keeping my life together. 

Allen Carr‚Äôs Easy Way was the key that unlocked sobriety for me. Then Craig Beck‚Äôs audiobooks kept me going. I then found a huge community of sober women on Instagram. Holly Whitaker and Laura McKowen and their HOME podcast provided resources and information. I learned about amino acid therapy, functional nutrition, and other ways of healing my brain and body. 

My life is now a good quality life. I sleep through the night and wake up rested. I‚Äôve managed to pay off all of my credit cards and personal debt. I‚Äôve taken care of my horrible dental problems. I‚Äôve had hip surgery to fix my chronic pain. My side hustle has become my main source of income.

On the way home on Sunday (which was hard because I was very hungover) I could see patterns in the pavement, as if I'd been taking acid, even though I hadn't. I suppose I was just tired, but it really worried me. I couldn't really sleep last night, anxiety was high, heart racing. I went downstairs to get some water and freaked out over a shadow. I thought I might have a panic attack but didn't. I just don't want to do this to my body anymore. I want my thoughts (I shouldn't be consuming poison) and actions (don't consume poison) to line up. I feel committed to making a change, but maybe that's easy in the beginning. I've done sober months before (Dry January etc). But now I think I want to quit permanently. I've read 2 sobriety books before: Glorious Rock Bottom and The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober. I liked both but I really recommend the 2nd one. It spoke to me even though I tried and failed to make a change at the time. I feel like alcohol has lead to so many problems. All the stupid things I've said and done. Sometimes I worry that I can't escape until I've had a proper rock bottom... But also I know I don't want one. I'm a total baby, and it's been bad enough. There's always a lower rock bottom. Better to try and change as soon as possible. I feel at the moment like a snail without a shell. Very vulnerable and incapable of surviving adequately in the world. Alcohol gave me a (false) confidence and an (illusitory) way to relax. I feel some anxiety about how to tell people I'm sober, but I read the thread on that here and it gave me a lot of options, so I feel a bit better about it. I feel some anxiety about not taking sobriety seriously enough to successfully avoid drinking. I'm taking it seriously now, I just don't want to relax and have the alcoholic voice say ""oh it's ok, only one, everyone's doing it, don't make it weird"". Or ""you say you don't drink, you just know they think you're an alcoholic now, they're picturing all the terrible things you might have done, they want horror stories from you"" or ""so you're just going to sit there for hours while they're drinking, and you're bored, and you're getting more bored while they get stupider"".

A situation that just wouldn't have happened to me if I wasn't drunk. Certainly I could still be mugged sober, but predators like easy targets. 

Another time I was passed out at a party. I woke up with writing all over my face. That was just about the laughs, but illustrates my point. Intoxication makes you weak and vulnerable.

I'm a few years in to sobriety now and one of the greatest benefits is having my wits about me. When I attend parties or gatherings, not only do I remember everything. I pay attention to details. I watch the drunk people. They often seem to be in their own world (liquid narcicissm). I see myself in them, and realize I was 'that guy.' 

The liquor industry itself is predatory. They need us, the dependents. If everyone just has a glass of wine or beer once a week. That's not going to cut it. They know that something like 10% of the population buys 90% of the alcohol. Your swollen liver is another mans yacht payment.

So I met a very sweet woman at AA a few days ago. She‚Äôs been super helpful with bringing me to meetings, introducing me to people and encouraging me but I feel like she‚Äôs also using me to vent and unload. She started gossiping about others who attend the same meetings as us. She talks a million words per minute and it really makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like it‚Äôs really damaging to my sobriety. It‚Äôs literally the entire ride to and from meets. Not a second less.

I really love that she‚Äôs kind and wants to help me. That she sees me as a person she can trust and open up to. But I feel like it‚Äôs just so she can complain to me and unload her problems/past traumas. I still have my things that I am trying my best to deal with sober and am only 8 days into this. I‚Äôm scared that this may eventually lead to my demise. I‚Äôve been trying so hard to practice mindfulness and stay positive. And I‚Äôve been doing great otherwise. People at the meetings tell me to stick with her. And I‚Äôm scared that if I tell her I can‚Äôt go with her anymore or tell her why that she‚Äôll either just show up where I live, start drama or spread rumors about me at the meets or who knows what else. I don‚Äôt want to be the one to potentially trigger a relapse either. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and I get she‚Äôs also going out of her way to help me but my sobriety needs to come first for me. And I‚Äôm way too new to sobriety to be handling other people‚Äôs baggage like this. She‚Äôs told me way too much about her in the last few days and I‚Äôm still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me. Is this selfish of me? I know there‚Äôs a step that says to help others and that the program only works if you help others but I feel like I need to help myself first‚Ä¶.

Has anyone been in this situation before? What should I do? I don‚Äôt want to offend or hurt anyone. But I need to continue this path without my peace being broken. 

Thank you for your time.


EDIT: I forgot to mention that it will be hard to not bump into her even if I just stop going with her as she attends at least 6 meets per day. This is what worries me since I don‚Äôt want to hurt feelings but I also don‚Äôt want drama.

I'm 26 and a FF/Paramedic, drinking is just what we do. Everyone I work with drinks in excess, until I got moved stations. Met a guy who quit drinking after drinking 10-15 beers every day off for 30 years. Cold turkey he did it. There's another guy here as well that has complelty quit drinking after waking up in the ER when he and he's brother split 3 30 packs one night. It made me realize that not everyone drinks. I drink every day I'm off, we work 24 hour shifts, 24 on 24 off, do that three times then we have four days off in a row. Throughout a normal day I drink 4-6 craft beers, if I cook dinner and eat at home that's it, but if we go out to eat I'll add a double tall whiskey and coke or two or three. I didn't realize I had a problem until one last September I got smashed at my wedding, and 2 I've put on 40 pounds, and 3 since about April I've noticed a massive increase in anxiety at work while sober. So much so that when I lay down to sleep as soon as I doze off I gasp and sit up like I just had a nightmare. I finally figured out I'm absolutely terrified of withdrawals. Mainly seizures. I constantly check my pulse, or find something to occupy myself while I feel that dread come on. At the end of my 24 hours I usually have no physical symptoms, I don't shake, my heart rate is 70s blood pressure normal, I just can't shake the feeling of dread that I'm going to have terrible withdrawal symptoms. I've always had terrible insomnia and don't sleep well at work. Or as well as you can when you have to wake up a couple times a night to run a call. When I get home I'll usually have 2 shower beers and take a nap, bout noon get up go get lunch and do something productive if it's a good day, if it's a bad day I'll start drinking again and take another nap, then eat dinner and have a few before bed, I usually go to sleep between 1-3 am and wake up for work at 6am. Been doing this cycle for atleast 2 years, I've drank every day I'm off but no this excess for 3 years prior to that. All it took was 2 beers a night to wind down.

The first sobering experience was when I started dating and she noticed the volumes I would drink and was concerned. Suffice to say I broke up with her we didn't have much of a connection it was just sex which I wasn't looking for. I drank a lot that night but then stopped drinking for 6 months with a few planned relapses, my health actually dropped I got IBS and that would cause me to be unable to work, one day I went to work and it flaired and I vomited some blood!

I was so confused I hadn't drank in 6 months got to the docs endoscopy done and nothing came out of it there was no scaring nothing I felt so much better and relieved. I quit the job it wasn't doing my mental health any favors working a night shift and having lousy neighbours I could barely get any real sleep. 

One day I decided to have a beer after going for a walk and it was my dad's birthday. I had that one beer that night and from that one beer I started drinking for about a month the moderating kind the max I would ever drink was 4 beers.

I gained a little weight my neighbours actually mentioned I looked better and I felt better the old charismatic singing and dancing me was back I was really happy that I could drink in moderation not have a hangover in the morning go about my day without drinking until around 5-6 in the evening or even just skip a few days. There was no pressure to drink. But it wasn't to last.I started to feel that everything right was somehow misleading doubt crept into my mind more often than it should. 

The hunger for alcohol was just starting to build. Hiding the drinks, buying more putting them in the fridge as to look like I didn't drink them all. Wait for my dad to go to work just so I could start drinking and go wild. The old me was back. Things just gradually got worse and worse my handle on alcohol was now handling me. Everything capitulated especially my mental health.

It would hurt too many people I thought.  So that day, I hatched a plan of killing myself with booze since it seemed socially acceptable and everyone would just think it was my vice.  On this day 1 year ago, I accomplished my goal.  Unfortunately/Fortunately some doctors decided otherwise and brought me back.  I woke up in the ER, hooked up to a ventilator because I couldn't maintain my airway.  Still to this day I don't know what caused me to collapse, maybe I tripped, or maybe it was the .39 BAC, possibly (probably) both.  As I sat in that hosipital bed and cried I realized the time the psychic had told me about when I was 24 (38 now) had finally arrived, her prediction was 100% accurate, alcohol was and will always be my greatest downfall.  It's depressing that I couldn't have just taken her advice back then, but then maybe I wouldn't have learned all the lessons I needed to learn, everything happens for a reason in my world.  


I still may not know what that reason is or why I am not dead, but today as I celebrated 1 year without getting drunk, with my two daughters at a fun park, I am thankful.  I am thankful for the days not spent hungover.  I am thankful for the money saved.  I am thankful for not getting any DUIs.  I am thankful because sobriety has allowed me to be a better parent, son, and boyfriend/fiance, employee, and friend.  I am thankful for all the people that have continued to be a part of my life despite my shortcomings. I am thankful for so much more as well and the list could go on.

Everyone who has shared their countless stories (and read my few posts) since I discovered this sub years ago, thank you.

And now that I do know I need it, the people who make up this sub have helped me maintain it for a year and I could not be happier.

Happy Monday, y'all!

Acts of Kindness (AoK) is the weekly thread where we check in about any AoK that we have participated in, received, witnessed, or heard about during the week which have touched us in some way. It can be an AoK towards people, animals, the environment - anything that you can think of is fair game.

This week's AoK gains inspiration from a conversation I had in the SD IRC chat room (link in sidebar). Someone in the chat brought up the fact that if someone who is in recovery from addiction is at risk of drinking while in an airport, they can request an airport attendant to page ""a friend of Bill"" which signals anybody who is familiar with AA that another person is at risk of drinking and gives them the opportunity to come provide support. This struck me as incredibly kind I had to pass it along to any who may have not heard of it!

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or have been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

Good morning and happy Monday, sober friends! 

I've recently been spending a lot of time thinking about my own personal ‚Äútipping point.‚Äù Or, what was it that made the difference when I finally got sober for real? I made a half-assed attempt to get sober a decade ago and lasted 8 months before I relapsed and went straight back to another decade of drinking. So, what was it that worked for me this time? What‚Äôs different now? I suppose I‚Äôm older and I spend more time thinking about my health and how I want to spend the rest of my years. I suppose I‚Äôm now married so I do have to take into consideration another person. I suppose I have really good friends who I care for deeply and don‚Äôt want to lose. I suppose I‚Äôm just sick and tired of being sick and tired. I‚Äôm done with the mystery bruises, embarrassingly hauling loads of wine bottles to the recycling bin, all of the blackouts, the shame, the hangxiety. It was also all of you. This was the first place I came to find help and connection, and I found what I was looking for here from all of you. Thank you for being here. üíú

You might lose your hips at 27 years old.","Just got diagnosed with avascular necrosis, or osteonecrosis of the femoral joints in my hips. Turns out brutally heavy drinking can cause bone death in your hips and possibly knees, causing chronic debilitating pain. Doctors say I‚Äôm too young for a double hip replacement but I have to convince them that there‚Äôs no choice. Never had so much physical pain in my life. Still nothing compared to the emotional pain I‚Äôve inflicted and have suffered from my drinking and specifically my last relapse. You truly have to hit rock bottom sometimes for true change. Just never thought I‚Äôd lose everything to get here. 

So don‚Äôt be like me and drink 43+ drinks a day during the worst of it, and then have a seizure and continue to relapse and go to detox 7 times and rehab and more detox after before you finally get shit down. 

I know we‚Äôre suppose to take it one day at a time, but I‚Äôm never going to drink again. There‚Äôs not a chance. I refuse to be the monster I once was.

I was really proactive in keeping my friendships strong over the spring and summer. It seems like it was a lot easier to get together and do outdoor activities, fun outings. Now that the weather is turning, most of my friendships center around sitting inside drinking. At the pub, watching the football game, stuff I'm just not interested in.

My friends have been supportive if maybe a little uncomfortable (because drinking is, and always has been, a constant, I mean no get together or activity was ever dry) that I feel like without the connection of alcohol I'm becoming more of an outsider. I know it's not unexpected, but it's never a good feeling. I also hate the realization of how much my longest and deepest friendships still seem to run on booze. Like 30 plus year, know where the bodies are buried, kinds of friendships. I feel like I'm always trying to force myself to prove that I'm still fun sober.

My physical health is way better (all my liver numbers are normal again) except I‚Äôm in the process of kicking a smoking habit I picked up in rehab. Hello chocolate chip cookies. 

I‚Äôm working again. I‚Äôm hired gig by gig so when I was really far gone I basically stopped working and burned some bridges and then lived off savings and royalties. But that only goes so far. I ended up with no savings. But I‚Äôm slowly clawing my way out and have work lined up for the next several months. Thought I was going to be homeless a year ago

I had hoped that I had earned the privilege of having a non-alcoholic beer but my wife had a bit of a breakdown over that idea so I guess that‚Äôs out of the question. I‚Äôm not going to press it but I was kinda looking forward to that minor reward next time we‚Äôre out to dinner. She‚Äôs just too deathly afraid I‚Äôll drink again (which says a lot about how bad I was). Maybe I‚Äôll ask again in another 12 months. Maybe never. 

Funny thing is beer wasn‚Äôt even my drink. I just am so tired of seltzer, Diet Coke, tea, and water. She didn‚Äôt flinch when I had a virgin pina colada several months ago so I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs an issue.  But there it is.

Tomorrow my reward instead will be getting up at 5:30 to get my kids ready for school and working a full day without passing out at my desk. But I won‚Äôt be drinking.

I'm pretty new around here and just looking for some support and to share my story so that I hold myself accountable over the next few weeks.

More and more over the last few years, I've been drinking a lot to cope with quite a few issues. I have Borderline Personality Disorder (diagnosed), ADHD (undiagnosed as of yet but I'm super confident I have it), probably depression and anxiety, and basically quite a lot of psychological trauma I haven't dealt with after growing up in an environment of irregular but highly random and scary domestic violence. I'm pretty sure either one or both of my parents had narcissistic tendencies. Whatever was going on, it was toxic AF. Anyway, I won't go into that right now.

Fact is, I really don't want my past to define my future. But nothing else seems to soothe me like a good bottle of wine and a smoke. I suppose a lot of you might be able to relate.

I have a supportive relationship (been together for 5 years) but last week he told me if I continue to drink the way I do, he needs me to move out and can't be with me anymore. I respect that. When I drink, apparently I get quite mean and verbally abusive and also super clingy and erratic.

\[I suspect this is because I am not that happy in my relationship, and I worry I've actually been drinking more to avoid dealing with this.\]

Anyways, he used to drink and smoke with me, but recently he has turned his life around. While I'm a little sad he's ""left the cocoon"" so to speak, I'm happy for him that he is getting his life together. He's quit smoking and works out on a regular basis. I just don't know if I'll ever be as sane or 'together' as the type of person he probably wants / needs.

With the BPD, this doesn't surprise me. I don't want him to have to put up with that, I can't seem to control it when it gets really bad. 

I think the potential ADHD has created a dopamine deficiency in me where I need to always find some kind of a buzz. I never feel content unless I'm drinking, sleeping, smoking or eating. Everything else feels mildly irritating.

But my turning point was last week. The point where I was like ""holy shit, I can't do this anymore."" I got blind drunk one night and forgot to attend my uncle's virtual funeral (virtual 'cause of COVID lockdowns). I couldn't bear to tell my mum (it was her brother who died) so I lied to her and just said I had a lousy internet connection. 

That was the moment I realised my drinking is beginning to make me a super shitty person. I know if I don't deal with this, it will only get worse over time. I can't stand the thought of hurting anyone, but I also can't bear the hurt I feel deep inside. Why must life be so hard?

Anyway, it's been 7 days and I haven't drunk or smoked. My boyfriend made me sign a contract saying I wouldn't drink for 90 days. He doesn't care if I smoke, but I don't want to because I'm scared I am destroying myself (I tend to chain-smoke.) 

I've decided to abstain from drinking and smoking (plus fast foods) for 90 days and see what happens. So I'm 1 week down, 12 to go. 

Worst comes to worst, I feel like shit for a while and can go back to my regular behaviours afterwards. In that case, I would just apologise to my bf, say I can't do it and live by myself somewhere and try to not bother anyone while I self-destruct.

Best-case scenario, turn my life around. See a therapist and start to properly fix my issues. Naturally desire a healthier lifestyle after experiencing how good it feels.

Damn, I really miss drinking and smoking right now :( 

Anyone got any advice to get me through? Anyway, just thought I'd share. Also, if anyone wants to give me a pat on the back for quitting both addictions cold-turkey I will gladly oblige. I need all the encouragement I can get right now!

Being able to get a more solid financial footing has been one of the greatest side benefits of getting sober. I often beat myself up, though, regretting how much I squandered in my drinking days and how far behind it feels like I am. And I've been spending waaaay too much time in that negative headspace lately.

Objectively, I know I‚Äôve come a long way, and I‚Äôm proud of that. I know sobriety shouldn‚Äôt just be for the ‚Äúcash & prizes,‚Äù but **it‚Äôd be really motivating to hear any success stories folks have of turning your life around financially after sobering up!** Being able to pay for a down payment on a house, finally digging yourself out from mountains of student debt‚Äîthat kinda inspiring stuff :).

I had no actual reference point in my mind to judge life by. 

Today I have exactly 250 days completely sober. And the life I thought I enjoyed and thought I was unable to leave behind no longer holds any appeal in my mind. I am able to wake up in the morning excited about who I am, who I am becoming, and who I can help along the way. Past passions I thought were gone for good have been restored and I am beyond grateful that I did not end my life in January. 

I am thankful for the program I got into.  My hope is that someone visiting this sub, much like i did at the beginning of the year, is able to see in my words that change can happen and life doesn't have to be what it has been. 

Thank you to the people that reached out the first time around your words and advice did help! This community is a needed one!",41,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.8409858}"

Lots of black out drinking in my early-mid 20‚Äôs.

But I watched her drink and drink, and kept drinking. I wanted to be there for her too, but then in her drunken state told me about how she never thought my relationship would last that long either (I‚Äôm poly, and the woman I‚Äôm going through the break up with is in an open marriage) and she knew I was a temporary person for her, and that hurt me badly. I genuinely thought I was over feeling this insecure lol. After all it was very real to me, I loved this woman a lot and I started to spiral like, she‚Äôs right. Why did I think it was going to last? She has a husband, a kid. Established relationships and she never needed/wanted me anyway. Questioned if she ever really loved me or it was just a fling to her since I was the first woman-aligned person she‚Äôs been with.

And while I‚Äôm at it, maybe inspire a few people along the way. 

About a month into my sobriety, I was sitting in my chair one morning, and realized that I had way more time, energy and money than I had in years. I also realized that the preceding month had been the hardest thing I had ever faced - withdrawals, cravings, apologies, owning appalling behavior I don‚Äôt remember, and following through with commitments I don‚Äôt remember making - but that each of those hard things had helped me. I remember thinking that morning that hard things seem to be good for me, so I wanted to find the hardest thing I can achieve, then work toward it. Something that requires me to put in work every day. To this day, I don‚Äôt know why, but I decided to do an Ironman. I didn‚Äôt know what it is, but I knew it involved swimming, biking and running, and that I didn‚Äôt know how to do any of those things. I looked it up and it scared me. Still does. 

An Ironman is a 2.4 mile swim, followed by a 112 mile bike, then followed by a 26.2 mile run - a full marathon - with no breaks between. Each person must finish in less than 17 hours.

I downloaded the Couch to Five K app (another bunch of incredible people on r/c25k) and started learning how to run. A couple of months later, I did my first 5K. Then, soon enough a 10k, then a half marathon. I started incorporating some bike riding in the mix, and a bunch of swimming drills (I‚Äôm in my mid-40s, and was doing mushroom sinkies in the pool).

I bought a base-building plan from a website and completed it, and somewhere along the way bought the crazy expensive bike. Then I finished a handful of shorter races, signed up for an Ironman, and bought another plan to ramp up training to the longer distances. 

I put in the work every day, and last weekend, finished my first Ironman in Cambridge, Maryland. I‚Äôm still beside myself with excitement over finishing the race, and have already signed up for another one next year. I‚Äôm already looking forward to the training I know it will require. 

If you‚Äôre lurking or in those early days and wondering if sober life will ever match the highs of your drinking days, please take it from someone who began as an obese alcoholic and became a very fit athlete with newfound dignity and confidence - we do recover. And when we do, we are unstoppable. Pick a thing. A hard thing. And go get it.

Sober fun is meaningful, memorable, intentional, building something fun.

Usually those things are with different people because people aren‚Äôt usually capable of being in those two modes interchangeably. They‚Äôre either in one place or the other in their life. 

I‚Äôm grateful to be able to say I spent about 35 years in meaningful fun and 5 years in insane fun. That ratio isn‚Äôt too bad. But I‚Äôll tell you what, I‚Äôm never going back to meaningless crazy fun again. It doesn‚Äôt last. In my opinion, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything because it and the relationships aren‚Äôt sustainable. It‚Äôs not building something, it‚Äôs just a wild ride that‚Äôs actually a slow mo train wreck. It seems fun until you realize what you‚Äôve actually been doing- flying through the air then realizing you had no parachute and splat you‚Äôre dead. Then, you try and rebuild your life. 

I think of it like a pendulum, too. In normal life, we swing a little ways to either side towards good and bad/highs and lows. Alcohol forces us to experience things as really really good (drugs) when they‚Äôre not. And our brains (docs talk about this) finally have to go just as far in the opposite direction to even out. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great until it‚Äôs not and why it‚Äôs so fucking hard when we stop.

Today I picked up my paycheck. It was totally wrong. My work screwed up my hours and pay which resulted in a loss of hundreds of dollars. Now I need to wait til next week for it to be corrected. 
Normally (and anyone who knows me could tell you just how true this is), this would lead me to the closest bar to pound some shots and black out on my way home in an Uber. But instead, I stopped, thought, and decided to take myself somewhere peaceful for a quiet lunch. 

So then, I went to a restaurant to sit by the water. The only available seat in the whole place was 2 ft from the bar. I decided to take it anyways and reminded myself that I was there for the view. But there were swarms of wasps (around 30 of them) that were landing in people‚Äôs drinks, on their food and flying at them. Which made my anxiety go through the roof! Normally, I would‚Äôve done a few shots and chased them with some beer to calm my nerves. Before making my way to the next spot to get hammered. Instead? I calmly asked for the check and left. 

Then I drove two hours to a store I wanted to go to just to find out that their hours online were wrong. Normally I‚Äôd find a bar nearby since I was out there and didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúwaste a trip.‚Äù Instead, I told myself to breath and that bad things happen in 3s so the rest of my day should be great! Instead of turning those 3 things into larger problems by drinking, I went to the market and got stuff to cook a nice dinner to celebrate being sober for a whole week. 


And here I am! I have another meeting in a few hours but today was magical. Sure I faced a few minor inconveniences (that I would‚Äôve let ruin my whole day when I was drinking), but instead of using that as an excuse to blame everyone, get reckless, and act out impulsively, I actually managed to do the right thing and stay sober. I feel alive and it‚Äôs freakin fantastic. The craziest part is that for years I‚Äôd secretly drink at the sign of the smallest problem especially if I was unsupervised and nobody would find out (well‚Ä¶ til I came home and could barely make it through the door).

Drink myself to oblivion almost every weekend and it's getting to the point where I'm starting to become deeply depressed about all the shame and regret I get after a night of binging.

I'm not violent, I haven't hurt myself or anyone else. But I get really loud and annoying. Had a particularly bad binge this friday and I haven't been able to think about anything but the regret and shame for my behavior.

I have tried to cut down. Be the slowest drinker in the company, switch between alcholic and non-alcoholic. Even tried the Sinclair method + therapy but it just doesn't work. I'll be fine for a night out or two and then I'm back in the binge-shame spiral. 

I'm terrified of what might happen if I keep drinking, I would just do anything to be able to have a healthy relationsgip to alcohol and be in control of my drinking. But I'm equally terrified of quitting. Thats the only way I socialize with friends and collagues, all of my big yearly traditions with friends involve drinking.

I just don't know what I should do. I'm scared and I just want to feel happy and normal and be able to have a beer with my friends without having to be terrified of what I'll feel like when I wake up the next day.

I will try not to make this extremely long, but cannot guarantee, but really would appreciate some input.

So, today is Day 5 for me and I woke up feeling great. I stopped drinking due to a multitude of reasons that I listed a few times. One of the reasons I wanted to quit drinking was because my husband and I have been having some pretty serious issues within our marriage over the past five years. Prior to quitting drinking 5 days ago, I let him know that I was not happy and did not want to live this way anymore and wanted to consider separating. At the same time, I am finishing up my Doctorate degree. He was upset and asked me to please wait until I finish my Doctorate and if I still felt the same way, then he would not fight me on it. One reason to quit was so that I can think clearly and rationally regarding how I feel, to see if we can make it through this. Without getting into the details, we have been living more like roommates rather than a couple over the past several years. Throughout this time, we have both been drinking after both of us having 10 sober years together. The problems started really before either one of us started drinking again, though (perhaps one of the reasons we so willingly picked up with alcohol again). 

Here is the problem. My husband was drinking daily as well, just not as much as I was. When we quit for 10 years, we did it together and it was a joint effort, as this is what we believed in going forward. When I told him that I NEED to quit, I asked him if he would be willing to quit with me, as it would be almost impossible to do so with him still drinking. He admitted that he had a problem as well, then agreed and he quit the same day I did. He promised that he would not drink at the house, but said he would not promise to not have a few drinks away from the house if he was out with friends. That was fine with me. Not a big deal. Well, initially, I was going to taper and bought enough beer/hard seltzer to taper with. I decided that enough was enough and stopped the next day after I hit 6 beers/hard seltzers on Tuesday night. I had approximately 22 left and I asked my husband to give them to our daughter/fiance (they do not have a problem like us). He said that he got rid of them, but later I found out that he just put them in the garage.

Fast forward to Day 3, and I was experiencing irritability but went out for the day on a trip to the mountains by myself. On my way home, my husband asked if I wanted to go to dinner, and I said yes. It was going to be a late dinner (8:00pm). He decided he wanted to go to an Irish Pub near us for dinner because he wanted liver/onions and it was the only place that had them. I was still irritable and it did not help that we were seated in a booth right across from the bar. I did not have a great time and he was upset over my reaction/irritability ever since saying it was a horrible dinner. Well, you know what, it was! I did not want to be there and told him before we went in. 

So a few hours ago, he brought it up again. I tried to explain for the umpteenth time that I am still going through withdrawals and Day 3 of my quitting was not the time for me to go to a bar and be totally fine with it. He then proceeds to tell me that he did drink that night (Friday night), which is when I found out that he put my leftover taper beers/hard seltzers out in the garage and he sat in the garage drinking when we came home and I went to sleep. I am NOT ok with this. I guess I am shocked that I felt like we would be starting this journey together again when this is certainly not the case. He proceeds to say that I said I was fine with him drinking outside of the house.....the damn garage is not what I meant or what was discussed. I had it in my mind that he was in this with me, but now I know he is not and I feel alone, living with someone that I thought I knew well. 

Am I wrong for being upset? I do not know what to think at this point.

I refuse to give into drinking and will cope another way. Actually, because of quitting and the withdrawals, I have not worked on my dissertation all week as I should have been, so I am going to go put some effort into writing for the remainder of the day.

Still going strong on my little streak here, so I wanted to jot down some quick, random thoughts about the experience so far. 

1. It's possible to do things I'd normally do drunk and still have fun without alcohol, like go to concerts or clubs. 
2. My concentration is much better and I think much more clearly. I've been on fire in class the past week and a half or so as such. 
3. I sleep better, and have actually been sleeping a little bit less on average since I haven't had to make up the sleep debt later in the week after drinking on weekends. 
4. I've been feeling very ""level"", which I expect is the natural result of almost 3 weeks with no Saturday/Sunday/random weekday morning hanxiety. 
5. It hasn't been difficult to turn down drinks (at the moment, at least). Admittedly, I will still feel the temptation, but it's fleeting. At this point, I have been telling myself that ""if I take this drink, I'll eventually end up right back where I was almost 3 weeks ago"" and that has been working.
6. When I tell my friends that I'm not drinking and why, they are more understanding than I thought they'd be.

I've only been tempted to drink a couple times so far, but it was easy to decide against it. I've actually been tempted more often in dreams lately than I have in real life. I listen to sobriety podcasts -This Naked Mind, Recovery Elevator- moreso for positive reinforcement and entertainment than as a lifeline for avoiding drinks. I like hearing redemption stories. 

I've started doing small things to go outside my comfort zone. I used to drink to ""loosen up"" before social events as I deal with a good amount of social anxiety, and now I've gone solo to two different volunteering events (first time volunteering) and felt surprisingly comfortable and confident. I went a work dinner and had a great time! The first work dinner I attended, I made sure to take some shots beforehand so I wouldn't have to drink too much at the event to loosen up. To my horror, there was no alcohol at the event, and I felt incredibly anxious. This time around, there actually was some beer, but I didn't even think twice about it!

I haven't noticed too many changes physically, aside from feeling ""better"" overall. I've always been a healthy weight, never fluctuated more than 10 pounds, but perhaps my face is a bit ""thinner""? I guess I wasn't expecting a whole lot of change there, so I'm not really disappointed. 

A month ago, a friend suggested I sign up for a local race. I've ran from time to time, but never more than 3-4 miles. I figured I'd try and run 6 miles, and if I could do it I'd sign up for the 10k. Ended up running 9 miles that day, and said fuck it, I'll do the half marathon. Well, I just ran it yesterday, finished with a much better time than I expected, and already signed up for another over Halloween!

I'm fairly sure I wouldn't be doing any of these things if I was still drinking like I was, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.",15,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.58527535}"

She brought it and commented as she left (probably repeating her mom) ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all about the alcohol, dad.‚Äù 

I heard it. I didn‚Äôt change anything for a few weeks until I woke up hung over one morning and a miracle happened. I didn‚Äôt drink that day. I didn‚Äôt drink the next or, so far, any days since. 

I‚Äôm almost two years sober, working a program, lost 50 lbs and have never felt better. I have anxiety and see a therapist but I will always be grateful for the off hand remark of my daughter, her mother for loving me and my Higher Power for taking the compulsion to drink away.

I quit cold turkey, it was rough and was into other drugs lightly (cocaine, benzos). After 6 months I began working again, seeing a therapist, etd. I even started dating, Once in awhile business dinners or outings require Heineken Zero or a light beer, so perhaps completely sober isn't quite true. However, it ends after that. Trust me like many people here one beer turns into a night of shots and hard drinking. I'm not saying it is easy or right, but it does work for me.

My family does not believe I'm sober. They also are not a fan of ~~my therapist~~ therapists in general I have to hide this from them  which I have not told them about because they're against using drugs to solve problems (in this case Xanax). It has helped me immensely in my sobriety and seeing a therapist has helped a lot.

That said my family doesn't like ""normal"" me which they equate to working out constantly and not going out. I did that to clean up but frankly I do not have a 9-5 job and need to to business dinners or just meet up with potential clients. Again, instead of 3 martini lunches I get a coke unless the odd occasion I get a Heineken zero or similar light beer.

II've been happy and my life has been back on track, it hasn't been easy all the time but I found out my family (mom) accuses me of slurring or having red eyes in the morning. Frankly my therapist agrees this may be dramatic on her part and due to change of my behavior. Me normal routine  doesn't need a strict regime to maintain sobriety or look at the clock to get to the bar,.

Now I consider myself better I'm moving out (no one believes this or anything I say). But this constant belief I will always be an addict and will relapse at a moment notice is not healthy for me. Worst of all my parents have told the rest of my family and lord knows what they said but apparently my aunt cries and prays for me every night.

Should I just cut them off and not deal with them after I move out? Frankly they're making my sobriety difficult, but don't understand this. I have never had any issues with drinking legally or like passing out in the yard like I've heard friends do (no judgement just giving an idea of where I was). I had a lot of actual things to do today work related and friend related. I know going out at all will result in reprimands about getting loaded. there's no arguing with them them that I did not drink.

I realize it takes time for people to accept alcohol abuse has been solved, but I stopped. I'm seeing a therapist (again they don't like because the therapist did not recommend rehab, and this was a therapist of their choosing)

I need to just get to the moving out in two months and I guess cut them off. In the meantime should I continue my lifestyle and ignore them as logic doesn't help? They've threatened to ""lock me out"" if I show up what they consider drunk. I bought a breathalyzer but they think I can cheat it so that won't help. Again being social and seeing friends who aren't drinking buddies are really helping me and as an adult in their 30s I don't feel the need to justify this. I'm not staying locked in my bedroom for two months and potentially lose out on professional opportunities.

For additional context my parents aren't drinkers at all and don't frankly leave the house or have non-family social groups. So I think maybe friends would help mediate they don't have that support group.

Edit: I offered to pay for them to come therapy with me with a therapist of their choosing but they believe the problem is me and they don't understand why they'd need therapy.

Edit 2: I never stole, asked for booze money etc. never drank at home so just heavy drinking late at night and using Ubers. Not making excuses just thought that would maybe help suggestions.",3,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4833438}"

I've probably had 100 Day 1's. You know what, though? Ive never quit trying and I keep pushing my bar. For years, a week was my record. Then I'd hit 30 days every 2nd or 3rd try. My next mark was 100, which I've hit about a handful of times. And now, my last good run, was 150+. 

""Kindling"" has been real and it gets kind of scary. I keep learning small lessons, though, through each lapse/ relapse. This last time started with a camping trip for the 4th of July. I was SO confident that I could have a drink with my family and friends. Almost 3 months later that turned into the same downward spiral it always has. Slowly but surely every single time. Now, after 5 days sober, while being incredibly sick the past several days, I'm picking myself up and putting another streak together. One day at a time.

This could be the one that sticks. If it's not, no blame, no shame. Never give up and never give in. I've proven time and time again that life is SO much better without alcohol. New tools and experiences for this go round. So, keep picking yourselves up. I know I will!

I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself. Sorry that it‚Äôs kind of long. 
        I‚Äôve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of 15 years. I‚Äôm 30 now. It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school, body shaming, childhood trauma, physical/mental abuse at home and from a teacher, rape, being taken by DCYF due to skipping school, and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried. I always felt like there was something wrong with me. I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the 8th grade as soon as I turned 16. I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes, self harm, drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also ‚Äúoutcasts.‚Äù I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain.  
       When I turned 17, I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home. I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world. Well, unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path. I stopped self harm and smoking pot/cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd pound down shots and put myself in risky situations.. But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it, I felt like I belonged. I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk‚Ä¶ I lost friends who were ‚Äúparty people‚Äù themselves. Cause I just couldn‚Äôt hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing. Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn‚Äôt help. 
Anyways, this went on for years. I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk, I got defensive and figured they were the problem. I felt like the whole world was against me. That they were the problem. When in reality, if you think everyone around you has a problem, you‚Äôre more than likely THE problem yourself. The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again. The ones who wouldn‚Äôt judge me and would feed my addiction.
I got so bad that I‚Äôd go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk‚Ä¶ Even if I just ‚ÄúIrish goodbyed‚Äù them after.  I‚Äôve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public.. But I wouldn‚Äôt say it was cause I got drunk. I‚Äôd insist that I didn‚Äôt drink that much and that somebody must‚Äôve drugged my drink. I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for 20 seconds. 
Nothing stopped me‚Ä¶ I thought I was so sly hiding bottles, burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less. Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess‚Ä¶ 
After all of this, I still never thought my problem was a problem. Last year I attended my first AA meeting. But I compared instead of identified. I didn‚Äôt take it seriously and despite staying sober for 2 months, as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine. What a joke that was. Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have 3 and be fine too. Ha. 
It got worse and worse. I denied having a problem cause it wasn‚Äôt daily. I‚Äôd just binge about twice per week. My poor fianc√© would come home from work and see me a drunken mess. 
But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago. If I don‚Äôt get help, I‚Äôm going to die alone. He‚Äôs going to leave me. I‚Äôll be stuck in this toxic cycle. And I cried for days thinking about it. Almost got suicidal. But then something told me I can‚Äôt give up. I can‚Äôt lose faith. That I am a great person when I don‚Äôt abuse alcohol. That I need help. 
That is when I swore on everything that I WILL (not just try) quit. I want to feel alive and have a purpose. I want a bright future. To have a family. A happy home. Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around. I deserve better. My family deserves better (even if they tried to enable me), and my fianc√© deserves better. 
I‚Äôve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets. I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me. I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others. I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder. I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage, keep a journal that I write in twice per day, I keep positive messages around the house, meditate and have been practicing mindfulness. I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday. For the first time, the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found. It was amazing. To be able to smile, laugh, talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for 15 years‚Ä¶.. I know it‚Äôs just the beginning but I feel blessed.. I feel like I‚Äôm on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew. I‚Äôll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life‚Ä¶.

Whether you are on day 1 or year 10, you got this and are doing amazing. Thank you.",44,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7518693}"

My husband and I met 9 years ago over beers and cocktails. We loved drinking. A lot. It was a part of everything in our life (dinner, lunch, outings, even when gardening). Needless to say it was a lot and it really put a strain on our marriage and on my own personal health. 

Three years ago we hit one of those points in life where a change HAS to be made or something terrible is going to happen. It was then that I decided to stop drinking and start trauma therapy. My life completely changed which meant me as a wife completely changed, too. I was sober, 80lbs thinner, running half marathons, kicking therapies ass, and connecting back to my faith. All the while my husband is still drinking vodka in front of me with no end in sight. I grew resentful because he never stopped to help me in the process.

A year ago he was diagnosed with a health condition that requires he not drink while on his meds. He still wanted to drink after coming home from the doctors office that day but I made him promise not to and he never did again. At least I thought. That was one year ago today. 

Six days ago on his one year sober anniversary he broke his back and foot. He now has a few months of healing to do at home and it‚Äôs been stressful for both of us. 

I‚Äôm the main bread winner. My husband has never really had a solid career direction which has caused stress in the past but 
we‚Äôve always been able to work through it. 

However, there‚Äôs always been a big imbalance in our relationship. I‚Äôm always the one giving or compromising while he sits in his comfort zone. It‚Äôs been weighing on me for a while and I thought I‚Äôd be able to power through but this morning was the straw that broke the camels back. I found texts that my husband was plotting to have a friend drop vodka and OJ off at the house. He just needed me to ‚Äúleave.‚Äù In the texts he was clearly disappointed when I would stay home (even though I‚Äôm his main caregiver right now). He was also telling friends & family the worst things about me. It made me feel like a monster when all I‚Äôm really trying to do is the best I can. 

This year has been a lot with my husbands health condition (epileptic), fertility (his swimmers aren‚Äôt working), and now his broken back. I‚Äôd be lying if having a drink didn‚Äôt cross my mind but I knew better because of the promise I had made to my myself and our marriage. I just wish he could have done the same for me. 

I‚Äôm really struggling with where things go from here. I‚Äôm a giver by nature but I feel so alone in my marriage and have for a while. 

I‚Äôm all about communication and have voiced my wants/needs to my husband but he never follows through. 

He always seems to do what‚Äôs good or easy for him. 

Example 1: I love to travel but he hates it. If we ever go anywhere it‚Äôs because his friend or family member planned it. 

Example 2: We‚Äôre from different states. We met in my home state but we live in his now because he hates mine. However, I miss my family greatly and long to go back but he doesn‚Äôt want to. 

Example 3: I bought our house completely on my own. He didn‚Äôt want to help because he doesn‚Äôt like to deal with anything complicated. He also couldn‚Äôt contribute financially and so he left me alone to do it all.

Anyway, rant over. Has anyone had a similar experience?

I'm a newly recovering alcoholic with 3 months sober under my belt. Like most alcoholics, I caused a lot of hurt and damage in relationships due to my alcoholism but...and this is a realistic but... but I was also recently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia (low spectrum). 

I've been self-medicating my symptoms for years without realizing it. I started to drink at the age of 18 and am now 48 and the reason I started was because of fear I had of people in particular. My paranoia is mostly perceptual. I'm on medication now and it has literally saved my life.

I want to ask for forgiveness from those I hurt but there's a complication in this for me because it wasn't just my alcoholism and in fact, it was mostly my schizophrenia that impacted most of my harmful behaviour. I was convinced that the people all closest to me were trying to deceive me, hurt me, and that they were all conspiring together to do so. It was not a ""maybe"" it was an integrated and absolute belief.

When I was told I was wrong and even shown evidence, I simply thought I was being tricked and I made many accusations, broke boundaries with many people who I was trying to use as a conduit to find evidence and destroyed those relationships by my suspiciousness and anger.

How do I apologize in a situation like this? I don't want to use my schizophrenia as an excuse but the reality is, that it was indeed the main cause of my behaviour. The alcohol is what eventually exacerbated my symptoms as was the isolation of the pandemic due to the acute stress and it got worse from there on.

If anyone here has dealt with something similar, I'd love to hear from you and how you went about it and if it was well received. Thanks in advance.",2,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.66889626}"

Yesterday I had a moment of intense temptation. I was outside my usual bar, couple of my older friends met me there. One of my drinking buddy is moving to a different city, so I thought I gotta go and meet him before he leaves. 

It was near midnight, everyone was pretty drunk, I could hear music from different bars in the area. As I was approaching my usual bar, I thought to myself for a brief moment ‚ÄòI have been sober for a year, it might be ok to drink this one time. I gotta do it for the old time sake‚Äô

And then just like magic, I see the bartender throw a guy out of the bar - this guy was completely wasted. Picking up fights. Shouting random words. The bartender threw him all the way out to the street.

Anyway, I""m working in one of the free bars where drinks are free and unlimited.  Basically, no shots.  Unless you're staff. 

For the last two days, we have been getting crushed from noon until about 10pm being so busy with a relentless series of 'VIP's that we rarely get a chance to get a bite to eat, let alone pee. 

It' s fun.  It's one of my favorite gigs of the year actually.  There's the Almost Famous vibe sometimes.  People are interesting, and you start to get to know the regulars because they come back... Regularly.  

Who can blame them?   Drinks are $15/each and total garbage in the general admission area.  

Anyway, this was a hard event for me NOT because I had both hands on liquor bottles the whole time, but because of the frequent toasts that happen with the staff as a 'reward' for tolerating the relentless pressure from demanding guests. 

This is the culture of these single serving events.   Our bar was literally built for this event by carpenters.  And it will be torn down and repurposed or discarded this time tomorrow.  Events are EXTREMELY wasteful, but that's for a different sub. 

Anyway, the point is, I had to actively resist the camaraderie and social pressure of having a cheeky shot at every lull of the flow of guests, but I'm proud of myself, because while it would have been awesome to have a shot with the team, It wouldn't have stopped there for me. 

And I would have woken up feeling like shit.  And tired.  And hungover.  And miserable for having broken my 72+ day streak.  

The point is, I hadn't thought about all the things I would miss as part of changing my lifestyle around living my life to my potential.   But in those several moments of vulnerability last night, I was able to remember what so many times I'd forgotten in the heat of battle in the past. 

My desire to be healthy, and productive, and useful is far greater than my desire to have a drink for any particular occasion.  And it just takes a bit of practice to get passed the voice in your head second guessing what you're saying, which is, ""No Thanks, I'm good.""

So, I made it to day 5.....I am ecstatic! I have been focusing on my recovery and reading as much as I can. I have also been posting a lot, as I feel this makes a difference for me in my recovery to connect to others going through the same and vice versa. That is what community is all about: connection, support, caring, being part of a family of awesome people that struggle, survive, encourage, mess up sometimes, to lift ourselves and others up when they fall off and to just be there to listen or lurk until ready to make your voice heard and reach out. I appreciate everyone on this sub so much! 

So, day 4 withdrawals were a little weird. I had some anxiety, fewer hot flashes with sweating episodes, FATIGUE, some irritability, trouble getting to sleep and some cravings, but they were not too horrible. I just grabbed my keto ice cream and ate the whole pint, lol! Another weird thing that I had was flatulence....like really, really bad. I wasn't going to post this initially, but you know what....decided to because it was just that weird!  I was like, really?? This now?? Thank god I was at home and not at work, lol!  It was more than just regular flatulence, it was unbelievably ridiculous. Needless to say, I decided to stay in yesterday! Has anyone ever experienced this in withdrawal? 

To my first point, I don't know what I would have done without the individuals in this community! I appreciate you more than you could know. Because of all the stories you guys have shared, the encouragement, the love and support of this community, I was able to quit. I have had my share of rants very early on when I was struggling to get professional help and could not due to not being able to take time off to go to inpatient rehab as suggested by one doctor ( I believe I had a different throwaway account at that point, but my posts were so emotional, that I was embarrassed and made a new account, as I was in an extremely dark place and that did not represent who I really am.....alcohol or no alcohol, just where I was at a speck in time). My GP told me that this is not their specialty and all I needed to do is wean myself off alcohol (like it was no big deal), then proceeded to give me the wrong literature for a source of help as it was only meant for heroin addicts. I was honest with the amount I was drinking, but she did not know how to deal with it. She actually had to leave the room and request advisement.  They would not assist with medication to help me through the withdrawals at that time. I was desperate for help and went home and cried for hours. I feel like all general practitioners should be trained on addiction and know how to deal with it when someone walks into their office for help. Not that they should be able to treat it, as a specialist, but at least knowing the basics, such as how to assess the severity of the situation and point you in the RIGHT direction for your addiction. Or what they could do in certain cases and how to advise patients on what they are going through. My GP had no idea how to handle this. BTW, I am going to make an appointment for bloodwork now that I have quit and am looking for a different GP.

.
.
. I hadn't changed much in my life, still doing the same routines, I held on to the anger  and resentments that constantly pulled me back down into the bottle in the first place !.
.
.
.My story is considerably longer, and the events of my life shaped the version of my Alcoholism! My disease was apparent very early.. The violence, and lack of empathy of my childhood would fuel my resentments for later use. 
.
. 
.Adulthood was premature, because I didn't learn how to grow up with a firm moral compass,  relationships where imploded, and combat would seem the only soothing alternative. 
.
.
. My sobriety would come when I learned how to find peace without alcohol, and without chaos as validation for me being me.  I had to acknowledge and let go of the reasons I stayed hostile and dishonest.  I practice daily how to be grateful and how to be helpful,  instead of self-serving and singular. 
.
.This my friend is a short version of how I have found that living in sobriety and sharing with others is more important than anything that a drink or drug would ever do for me.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hungover from a three-day bender or have been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, let's not drink alcohol!

\---

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone, and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice, or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good morning, sober friends, and happy Sunday! I'm so happy and honored to be here to host my first DCI. You all have helped me so very much through my first months of sobriety, so thank you, thank you, thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è

My early sobriety has been all about going inward, listening to my own (often painful and shameful) truth, daring to be and do life differently, seeking guidance and strength in myself and others, and working toward personal transformation - one day at a time. I‚Äôve never been a poetry reader or lover, but I came across [*The Journey* by Mary Oliver](https://imgur.com/JxW5WvR) and I think it encapsulates what many of us are feeling when we make the decision to live a life without alcohol. 

THE JOURNEY

*One day you finally knew*

*what you had to do, and began,* 

*though the voices around you*

*kept shouting*

*their bad advice--*

*though the whole house* 

*began to tremble*

*and you felt the old tug*

*at your ankles.*

*‚ÄúMend my life!‚Äù*

*each voice cried.* 

*But you didn‚Äôt stop.* 

*You knew what you had to do,* 

*though the wind pried*

*with its stiff fingers*

*at the very foundations,* 

*though their melancholy*

*was terrible.* 

*It was already late*

*enough, and a wild night,* 

*and the road full of fallen* 

*branches and stones.*

*But little by little,* 

*as you left their voices behind,* 

*the stars began to burn*

*through the sheets of clouds,* 

*and there was a new voice* 

*which you slowly* 

*recognized as your own,* 

*that kept you company*

*as you strode deeper and deeper*

*into the world,* 

*determined to do* 

*the only thing you could do--*

*determined to save*

*the only life you could save.* 

\-Mary Oliver

**Are there poems, quotes, or words that you read to remind yourself why you‚Äôre here, or that motivate you to stay here?** 

Of course, they don‚Äôt have to be serious. A friend recently shared with me: 

*‚ÄúThere ain‚Äôt no answer. There ain‚Äôt gonna be any answer. There never has been an answer. That‚Äôs the answer.‚Äù* \-Gertrude Stein

I honestly wonder if I even want to sometimes. I love my kids to death but if my wife never matures or gets a handle on her business I worry she will always be a source of stress and chaos in my life. My drinking and anger and her lying and gaslighting has created such a toxic situation and I hate that it could end like this.

Today is one month sober for me. Since moving out, I've gone to the gym or worked out daily, gone on bike rides and started to eat healthy. I started going to AA twice a week. I feel less stress and less anxiety. I had almost forgotten how kind and mellow I am outside of the chaos of my home. I've lost fifteen pounds and feel physically better than I have in quite a while. I'll be back to my early twenties weight within a couple more weeks I'm sure.

Some days I feel like I'm actually learning how to love myself for the first time in my life. This admittedly feels wonderful. Other days, I sit with my sadness and think on what it would mean if my marriage ended in divorce. I usually tear up a bit at the thought and move on with my day.

Sometimes I feel like a plant trying to grow toward the sunlight with no real sense of where it is or if it is. Those days I try and find a way to grow on my own in some small way. Months ago I asked my wife if she could sew a button back on to my favorite shirt. She kept forgetting and just never got around to it, which is a fairly common occurrence with her. I never learned to sew and I probably could have taught myself. I think I just wanted to know if she cared enough to do a simple thing for me. Like maybe she would sew the button back on and it would feel like some little gesture of love.

Today I sewed the button back on to my favorite shirt for myself after looking up how. It's not perfect but I feel a little bit of pride from learning how to do a new, simple thing at forty years old. And it's still bittersweet as fuck.",17,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3916497}"

Not to mention how many times a couple beers turns into buying a fifth. So while I won't be drinking tomorrow if any of you have any go to  non alcoholic drinks that won't add to the waist line I'm trying to work down and won't have me hopped up on caffiene I'm open to recommendations!

I feel incredible. I honestly can't believe how much better I feel now than I did at one month, two months, three months, etc. It just keeps getting better. Nothing magical about that---I'm just gradually learning how to handle my emotions in different situations. My baseline anxiety and depression also decrease as I get better at coping with life. Plus, of course, I don't have the constant background anxiety of worrying about being a substance abuser, destroying my health, etc. Been to the dentist, got my teeth cleaned. Went to the doctor, got just about perfect lab results, including the liver function panel, which was surprising, and for which I am grateful.

Sobriety, which terrified me, which I always thought was impossible, which I always thought would be boring, turns out to be what I needed. What I needed for years. What a simple solution to all of life's complicated problems! Since I quit, I see how much of the confusion and unhappiness in my past life was (and in the lives of so many of my friends is) due to alcohol use. I wish that someone had told me years ago how much better you feel when you're not drinking. I wish we had a better word than ""sobriety"", which still does sound kind of awful and dreary to me. In any case.

I was so proud at my therapist's office two days ago, telling him that I was six months sober. ""Yes, first of all---that's a wonderful accomplishment and you should be very proud of yourself. But second, I'm thinking---what do you want to do next?"" Sobriety is giving me the ability to calmly and rationally consider what it is that I want to accomplish---who I want to spend time with---how I want to spend my time. I feel hope.

After two months of thoughtful, diligent, and consistent work of being sober...it all went out the window last night. Now that I have sobered up I have gained the ability to have a perspective of the situation which last night was impossible for me to see. I am a 24 y/o male and in the past I've looked and read many genuine posts on this subreddit. For the past 7 years since I began drinking at the age of 16-17 it has been an up and down roller coaster that many members in this community are all too familiar with. It is comforting for me to read stories that, although not necessarily the same as my unique case, ring true to the sentiments which I feel in moments like this. I have all of the respect in the world for the members in this community. The 6-7 year process that I have gone through has all led up to today. I feel that I can see clearly now that drinking is an indulgence which for me, as well as many of you, cannot be responsibly enjoyed. I would like to thank anyone who takes the time to read my story, and I can only hope that my words comfort at least one other person out there somewhere who can relate to my case. I will keep this post as short and to the point as I can. Without further ado here is my story:

Although the circumstances are quite blurry 7 or so years later, I remember the first time I drank being around junior year of high-school. The idea that a liquid you ingested could somehow alter your perceptions and reality seemed profound to me. It was an experience that I wanted to - for lack of a better word - experience. I indulged in the devious and conniving experience, drinking alcohol, for the first time by chugging a quarter-filled plastic water bottle of vodka that my friend Mike had in his trunk. I was hanging out with some high-school buddies of mine at a local basketball court. I chugged whatever shitty vodka was left, and almost instantly had a rushing sensation. This sensation made me feel great at first. I was so happy and giddy that I wanted MORE but there was nothing left to drink then. Drinking on the weekends with friends not only became a regular occurrence but transformed into an almost religiously followed weekly occurrence that seemed normal to me. The illusion that this was normal fooled me for so long. Until recently I have been unable to see the brutally honest facts of reality which exist. I was having fun with friends it seemed like a very normal rite-of-passage that I thought all high-schoolers engaged in. The fact is that the drinking was not normal at all. I would regularly binge drink to point of oblivion until I reached the point where I would inevitably and disgustingly throw up into a toilet bowl or wherever I could do it without being seen. It was embarrassing. It was frowned upon in my social circle to ""not be able to handle your liquor."" I now know that this is completely irrational. Some people cannot handle any alcohol in any form let alone liquor, which is a category I unfortunately but certainly fall into. Do I wish I could drink like a ""normal person"" and indulge in a responsible and social manner with friends? Yes, absolutely. Generally speaking drinking can be quite fun and entertaining, but for me it always ends in brutal and different forms of failure. I have never been arrested, which I honestly have no reasonable explanation for considering all of the wild situations I have gotten myself into. Nonetheless, last night I ended the night by walking from the bar I was at and passing out on a plot of land. I have no idea where this is or how I got there. All I remember was being awoken by several police officers who seemed genuinely concerned for my well being. It was because of these individuals that I eventually was given a ride home by someone they had called. I can only attribute this to my white privilege. I don't want to go on a tangent and make this post political, but I think it is reasonable to say that because I am a white male from a wealthy area I may have been treated differently than certain other individuals from different demographic backgrounds. I wasn't acting irrational or erratic when I engaged in conversation with the officers. I was heavily sedated by how much alcohol I had ingested, and just wanted to go to sleep. After an emotional and honest conversation with the officers, in which I made clear to them that I felt like I should be arrested, they decided to not cite me for drunk in public and instead called someone to take me home. I am very gracious for the kindness that these officers showed me last night. All things considered I only lost my $500 glasses which I recently bought, so in the grand scheme of things the consequences for my actions last night were not too severe. Previously I had been sober for the past two months with the exception of a baseball game two weeks ago where I fell into the trap and had several beers with my coworkers who I was meeting for the first time in a social setting since starting work a year ago. I felt awful after the game, like I had thrown away a month or so of hard work being sober, for no purpose. I still live with my parents and they have been well in tune with my relationship with alcohol ever since my dad had to pick me up in a blacked-out state from the local golf course where I was working at the age of 17. I got fired the next day, but luckily the police were not involved and again I was fortunate because it was hushed away as if nothing happened because my parents were members at this country club. I felt like a complete disappointment in the eyes of my parents when I talked to them the next day. Previously they had zero knowledge that I had been drinking alcohol for the previous 6 months or so. That was the first time I was able to reflect and question whether I should consider not drinking. The next 6 years or so is all a blur and in those years I've been through many similar situations as I got into last night. I've tried quitting here and there, but no change has been successful for any long period of time.

After I was successful in not drinking, and overall improving the quality of my life and relationships I have with my family over the past two months I felt a sense of confidence that enabled me to go to a bar after work yesterday. I was empowered by the thought that I had been fine drinking with co-workers the other week so I felt I could be successful in curbing the urge to binge. Obviously, I again failed miserably. I had a long conversation with my mother this morning, where I was completely up front with her about what happened. My dad had found my shirt and wallet outside so they knew something had obviously gone wrong. I appreciate having my parents support in stopping drinking. I've failed so many times that my confidence in my ability to quit is very low. I feel like again I will not drink for a month or so and then gain some confidence and fall into the same repetitive cycle.

I feel like I'm gaining this newfound clarity on my life and it's kind of got my mind in a twist. I've spent the last day or so reflecting and realized there are many areas in my life that I'm unhappy with. I guess that realization was scary before but now I almost feel comfort in at least being able to identify the problems. Even in regards to my career, goals, friendships and relationships. I haven't been happy for a while, alcohol always masked that or made me avoid it altogether. Everytime I'd feel down or even see a glimmer of issues popping up, I'd drown them in 2 bottles of wine and that was just to start.

I'm now experiencing thinking and feeling in a sober state of mind, and feel ready for change and positive change at that.

I‚Äôve never been a sloppy drunk, but my weekends consisted of drinking to excess and being hungover for Sunday, exhausted still on Monday, and still trying to catch up on Tuesday. This left me with two days to be healthy before I repeated it all over again on Friday night. After Labor Day I bought a scale and realized that I had gained 30 pounds over the last year.

So the past three weeks I‚Äôve cut out all alcohol, worked out every day, and introduced intermittent fasting into my daily life. I‚Äôm down 10 pounds! I‚Äôve been really nervous to see friends and have to explain this change to them. Last night I stepped out for the first time and sure enough within minutes I had been asked several times if I would like a beer. When I said I‚Äôm trying to cut some weight as my excuse for not drinking, I was handed a whiteclasw and was told that whiteclaw and tequila are healthy. I held my ground.

Towards the end of the night, I looked around and saw how many people were so sloppy drunk. It made me really happy with my decision to not drink.

Instead of waking up hungover today, I‚Äôm going to enjoy my book (Daisy Jones and The Six), workout with my brother-in-law, and have a nice dinner with my family.

My goals are to drop about 30 more pounds and pick up some hobbies. I‚Äôve kind of come to realize that the only thing I did for fun the past ten years was drink.. I‚Äôm still pretty terrified to go on sober dates, so for now I‚Äôm putting that on the backburner, but I‚Äôm feeling more comfortable stepping out with friends after last night's success.

im 36 days sober and tbh i thought a lot about the option to drink again when my mental health is better. i drank because of my anxiety disorder because i only felt normal when i was drunk. not a good coping mechanism. im going to go to a psychosomatic clinic sometime in the next weeks and hopefully i feel good again afterwards. and i swear everytime i thought about the fact that my mental health will be better in 2/3 months i imagined to drink again. not much, not when i have a bad day, not alone. and these thoughts felt good. to know you can never drink again is scary, not imaginable. the christmas markets open soon and they are not the same without mulled wine, my 20. birthday is in a few months and gosh how should i celebrate this without getting drunk? doesnt get life boring when i cant drink anymore? 

but today is the first day where the thought to never drink again feels nice. i dont want to. it feels good to be sober and to wake up everyday without having hangxiety. why do i think my life has to be boring without alcohol? why do i think i need it? i love to see how the days im sober become more and more. i want it to stay this way. and that decision feels fucking good.

Just wanted to share my past weekend experience. I've been drunk every birthday that I've had since I turned 20. This past weekend I turned 30. Went and did a weekend trip to a big city with myself, my SO, and three other friends. 

The first night we went to a fancy restaurant that we've been to before. The person, who I didn't know, that was sitting around six feet away from me got an old fashioned (fancy). They take an orange peel as well as cinnamon sticks and put a lighter underneath them to make the aroma stronger. I've had it before. It's fucking delicious. I won't lie, the thought of ""weeeeeeell, it is my 30th birthday......"" crept into my mind. 

I resisted. 

I focused on the amazing food in front of me and that was all I needed to break my negative thought process. 

We went to see a comedy show the next night (my actual birthday), one of my favorite comedians. The venue that the show was at was surrounded by bars. Everyone with me was drinking. The line to get in the venue stretched as far as you could see. The show was running way behind, and eventually it took us an hour and a half past the time that the show was supposed to start to actually get in and sit down.

Standing in line, kind of pissed, on my 30th birthday, with a bar LITERALLY right next to me, was tough. Like, I could basically reach out and touch the bar, and I was angry that it was taking so long. Once again, it crept in: ""weeeeeeell, it is ACTUALLY your 30th birthday tonight, it's a big occasion, and you're a little upset. A beer or two would calm you down and probably make the show better"".

I resisted.

I stood in line, focused on being mindful, and finally sat down inside. Two of the friends that came with were drunk out of their mind. I don't really even know if they remember the show. Everyone around me was PLASTERED. 

I am so glad I didn't drink anything. It was nice to be able to really watch and enjoy the comedy show (which, funnily/ironic enough and unbeknownst to me, was about the comedians recent stint in rehab for alcohol and drugs). The show felt validating and relatable. I was able to drive back to our airbnb and woke up feeling amazing the next morning... Not hungover. 

I'm glad I didn't drink. When I started my sobriety I told myself that on my 30th birthday I would have a few drinks (my addict/alcoholic thought process at the time: ""since it's SUCH a big occasion that you should totally drink at because you should at least get that to be able to drink, and dont you think that by then you'll have had enough sober time under your belt to enjoy a fewwww little drinks"" etc etc). I didn't do that. I'm so glad I didn't. It looks like sobriety is here to stay, and I'm so glad I have the mental fortitude to resist.

Anyways, thanks for reading. Hopefully you got something out of it. I really appreciate this subreddit. Have a great weekend!",25,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5192979}"

 One striking effect of addiction, for me, was shame. First, the shame of buying; it wasn't here at first, but at the moment i realised i had a problem, i had shame every single time i went to the shop; this shame pushed me to change shop every day, because in my mind shopkeepers won't see i had a problem; if i bought to the mall next to my place one day, next morning i walked 4 kilometres to go to the other mall, to avoid any kind of judgement (which was in my mind anyway, so i know that was stupid); but that was the easiest shame to cope with;

the other shame was , first, about myself, about the failure of my drinking the previous night; a failure to myself, to my strength, to my will  that i accepted as inherent to my alcoolic struggle; i kinda shrugged it off, day after day; it was part of me, and quite never left me (again, i'm talking from the moment i started to see my consumption as a problem)

but then..there's the unbearable shame of my actions..when i had a girlfriend, the shame of going through countless episodes of fight and cries ;i've never been the type to hit, so no physical violence, just...unbearable diputes and deception over deception, and as i disappointed her i was disappointing myself so much..and i was ashamed to make her suffer for me, she suffered because she liked me, she suffered because she saw, she realised i was fucked up, not only at the time of drinking but internally, enough fucked up to bring me to that point of drinking.. she suffered because she cared, and i was not blind to that, so i was ashamed of myself to the point of disgust;

then, when she left me, the shame of it all..[it's not because we are drunkards we don't have some kind of clarity about what's happening] the shame of being alone, the shame of retiring from my social circles so i could drink all i want, like Gollum and his ring; the shame when , waking up, i saw my mobile phone full with messages of friends and not-so-friends asking if i was allright, because i sent them too many weird messages when too drunk to even articulate properly, the shame when my brother called me in panic because i left him a message crying, yelling at him that i wanted to die, that my life was miserable...(i have no memories of that message;but i remember that feeling oh so well) and finally...

the shame of waking up tied in an hospital bed, out of a coma after a drunk evening during which i fell on the street and almost died of cold, with 3,5g of alcohol in my blood; while waking up in that hospital, i had no idea what i was doing here, of course, but a couple of friends were here (thanks to the police who picked up my phone to find them) and...my dad.. none of my friends, none of my family (except my brother) knew i had an alcohol problem; but at that moment, it was crystal clear for everyone..and i felt the biggest shame of my life, because they cared, and i didn't ; because they worried for me, and i didn't; from that moment i tried to stop three times (day 42, day 8, day 90 here on that sub, each time resetting the counter) and i feel like actually it is going pretty well

BUT the desire is always here; not constant, not everyday, but that little demon voice knows when to strike, and knows its way to my mind; the thing is, now, I FEEL FUCKING PROUD of myself. I feel proud that i went more than a year without touching a single drop of alcohol, i feel proud that this summer i was able to go to a live concert without the need of a beer, i feel proud around my friends, who all have babies now, and changed their lifestyles, i feel proud to be a good uncle for their kids, i feel proud to wake up in the morning not devastated by nausea, incapable of doing even the simplest chore, i feel proud for regaining control of my body, i feel proud that i look more healthy, and lost ten pounds in the process, i feel proud and it is for me the best antidote to failing one more time

today, i wanted to buy drinks so much...and i didn't , not because of my health, not because ""alcohol is bad"", i didn't buy drinks because i'm too proud to fall again. Cultivate pride, it's a powerful feeling, out of self respect and consideration for your life, and life in general; cultivate your pride, wether you're on day one, or day 20,30,50,100..it doesn't matter. Every day you go on without giving up is a day you should be proud of yourself. You're a fierce warrior, winning the battle today...be proud of yourself.

2021-09-25 07:09:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pv4qoi/day_4/,Day 4,"Good morning!!

I have made it to Day 4 and am feeling great, considering that I am having minor withdrawals. Sorry for these long posts. I am trying to keep myself accountable and posting progress each day during the early days, so that it may help others know what to expect in case they are contemplating quitting. I definitely know that everybody is different, but I know what has worked for me this time in terms of withdrawals and mindset.

So, yesterday someone posted a question regarding diarrhea during early sobriety.....I am just going to go there. Yes, this is a thing, lol! I thought something else was going on with me, but no, I think this may be common? The first 2.5 days......this was one of the issues I had. I thought, great, now I have some stomach bug on top of trying to quit drinking! No fever, or chills, just THAT.  I now don't think that was the case. My body has now calmed down, thank goodness, with that one.

Well, yesterday, I decided to take off to the mountains to this Amish cheese shop, where they sell all kinds of herbs, spices, candies (stayed away from these), cheeses, meats, etc. that their community makes....they are really inexpensive. I am fortunate that I live approximately 1.5 hours from both the ocean to the east and the mountains to the west. I wanted to take this trip to distract myself and to do something new. I definitely enjoyed the views, but I was so irritable all day. Also, still began with a sudden spike in heart rate (subsided within minutes) and breaking out in sweats on occasion. Thank goodness I was by myself, but then decided to come home. My husband called and asked if I was interested in going to dinner, if not, he was going by himself. I asked him to wait, as I had not eaten anything all day (could have contributed to my foul mood, but also think it was withdrawal). By the time I got home, it was 8:00 pm, so very late dinner.

I came home and put away my purchases. We left and he wanted to go to this Irish Pub.....great, lots of alcohol. I thought, this is way too early for me to be around alcohol, but decided to push through it. Still in a mood, I drove and when we pulled in, the parking lot was packed. We went in and the entire restaurant was full of people. We were seated in a booth by the bar, and I was so livid at my husband at that point. Not his fault per se, but he wanted liver and onions and this is the only place around the area the offers this. At first, it hit me, damn I want a drink, but then I heard this loud laughing (like a girl, but omg...it was a guy) and another guy with the party at the bar, saw someone he knew as they were leaving and they stopped (of course right beside me in our booth) as he came over. It was a mother with 2 teenage children and the guy came up slurring and talking about how much he missed ""this guy"" (teenage son). Don't know the relationship, but he stumbled, hugged the mom, then the son and said, ""I really miss this guy"" and she said, ""well you should come visit"". He replied ""I think it would be weird for me to just come to hang out with this guy"" (then laughed as if there was no tomorrow), then kept going on and on. I don't know if he was a teacher, coach, or what, but they were obviously uncomfortable. I thought to myself, omg.....is this what I looked like sloshed in public?? The feeling of wanting a drink QUICKLY went away. Especially, after sitting there eating our dinner, with our water/lemon, and watching all of the other intoxicated people in the pub.....some just having a good time, and some acting, well a little (or a lot) too intoxicated (stumbling, slurring, loud).

So, one thing I have learned this early, is that I can push away those thoughts of wanting a drink and even being around it. I am documenting this to reflect back upon if the urge comes again so that I can recall the reactions of that mother and her children as that obviously drunk man came up to talk to them, or rather slur at them. So day 3 withdrawals: Foul mood, diarrhea (part of the day), slighted elevated heart rate at times, sweats, urge to drink then that urge was squashed as of cringe-worthy experience, lack of appetite, fatigue.

Firstly, I would like to thank you all for the support I have received over the last 70 days. It has been a difficult time. So, thank you for allowing me to share my emotions and thoughts with you. 

I have been needing to tell people all about me over the years, I'm typically an open book in person, usually when I have had a few drinks. I'm somewhat of a 'bottler' I keep to myself and never like confrontation, keeping all my emotions inside by simply staying silent and not being able to cope with the situation but unleash my brain on alcohol I would purge myself in a jumbled mess. I have been like this for most of my adult life. 

When I would drink and was in a good mood I would be positive and confident, share my feelings more openly especially the good emotions and be supportive. however, if something upsets me it would cause me to go silent, I would repress my emotions, back down and want to run away from the situation, only to return to the emotions by myself in my mind and mentally torture myself as I felt I deserve it. This has now become curious to me why is it that I can't seem to find the words to say during difficult times?

Fast forward to 70 days later of abstaining from alcohol, 5 therapy sessions later and working hard on improving myself. 'just because you're broken doesn't mean you don't deserve improvement' 

Involve people in your life that are true friends the ones that contact you out of the blue to see how you are.  'surround yourself with people that want the best for you'

Workout a minimum of 2 days a week if not every day positively expend the negative energy. 'Walk or ride in the wilderness take in the scenery talk to the animals, get wet, stay dry, get lost, enjoy nature'

Read a few pages of the book you have been wanting to read even if it's just a few pages or a chapter. Or, listen to an audiobook or podcast. 'let the negative thoughts come then shift your focus on your breathing then let it go'

Always say what you are feeling even if it's on here it's better out than in. Yes, every day is different with the highs and lows, let the high times roll and kick the lows in the ass! From Day 1 to Day XXXX don't be hard on yourself.

It also became apparent through moderation, that I was obsessing over alcohol. It became more important to me and I would feel like I really earned it after days of abstaining. It was pathetic. There were other factors involved to be sure. The idea that I should quit had been with me for years, but I kept postponing it. The psychedelic experiences made me want to do it right now.

Today they all just crashed on me. I had a sugar crash after work and couldn‚Äôt wait until I got home to make food so I got McDonald‚Äôs. Which just reminded me how bad my diet has gotten.

I did laundry, and noticed instead of folding my XL shirts they were all clean and my XXL shirts were what I was folding. 

I watched some math lectures for fun, reminding myself how far away from my education goals I am at. 

I watched desperate housewives, reminding me how poor and alone I am. 

And fuck. It just crashed. Like a huge weight. Alcohol took everything from me. And now I can‚Äôt pick one up without my adhd kicking in and having do another thing. my adhd having been increased because of my inability to process the correct amounts of dopamine, thanks to alcohol.

For the first time since these dreams started, my endeavor had finally made it's way into the dream world and I turned down the imaginary drink. 

I've turned down drinks at weddings and walked past liquor aisles without looking at it in real life, but I would drink every time in my dreams.

A small part of me was sort of hoping my SO would suggest we go out somewhere so that I could wiggle my way into a possible drink. 

I sat there for a moment and thought about how awful I felt on day 1. The unbelievable anxiety and the physical pain I was feeling. How I literally had to call out of work because I was suffering mentally and psychically. 

I thought about how day 2 I still felt anxious and dizzy. I wanted to leave half day but pushed through a full day of work. I didn‚Äôt even sleep that night from the sweats and insomnia. 

I thought about how last night was the first night I actually got a decent sleep. I imagined if I were to drink, waking up at 3 am and chugging water down to try to prevent the inevitable hangover I would have before lying in bed again with anxious thoughts for hours before falling asleep again. 

I thought about waking up tomorrow with a hangover, and having to meet with my mom to go look at a wedding venue. My mom knows I suffer with alcohol and I occasionally lie that I‚Äôm doing okay. But she can see right through me when I‚Äôm not. I would have ruined a day we were both looking forward to.

That honestly did the trick. The stupid thought of going out and finding any way of getting a drink disappeared. I even went to the store and grabbed the four items I needed, happy to actually check out at the self-check instead of waiting in the long lines (because I didn‚Äôt have alcohol).

It scared me to verbalize my commitments to myself out loud to him, but I did it. We continued w our evening, had dinner, played w the kids, and were relaxing together on the couch.

I remember doing multiple things and believing I was doing them for the first time while SO told me that I just dont remember them

I remember how many fights I started with my saint of an SO for no good reason at all and how upset I made us both

I remember... some parts of 2016ish-2021ish, but honestly it's kind of a blur

I remember those times I called out of work sick because I was so hung over I couldn't even get out of bed till afternoon.

I remember sneaking extra drinks so that I could have more than people think.

I remember doing insanely dangerous things and thinking it's okay because I have been lucky enough to have gotten through them without any incidents at all every time.

I remember how if I started drinking, that meant that I will not stop drinking that day. It was only ever really a matter of deciding when to begin.

I remember how 23 days ago I started drinking pretty damn early, then proceeded to pick a heated fight with SO for no reason again, later took an angry ""nap"" in one room and 7 hours later woke up in another completely lost and confused and pretty god damn scared.

And I just cannot afford to ever forget that s**t, let alone go back to coasting though life so hardly present to not even remember very much of it at all. 

I drank away all of my late 20's into practical nonexistence. That's enough time sacrificed to this crappy addiction, I'm finished, thank you.

I just simply have to remember because I need to always remind myself why stearing clear of booze is so so so very worth it.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Six months ago, something in me broke. I was so FRUSTRATED at my life. I had no goals, no plans, was obsessed with meeting a guy to give myself value, not caring about my well being, and miserable. I came home to a situation that was uncalled for and thought, ""I hate this. How do I get out of this. I go pursue that career in human resources I've considered for a year. How do I do that? I go back to school. Okay. I will apply immediately. But, I HAVE to quit drinking.""

I can't even explain it. I just stopped thinking about the bottle and thought about ME. The switch was FINALLY flipped. I placed goals in my life. I went to the doctor and dentist. I worked on my diet (I have fallen off, but I'm not quitting). I stopped obsessing over being with someone and started loving the fuck out of Poppi. Poppi is an AWESOME lady guys! She rocks!!! I can rationalize my emotions and NOT stay stuck in perpetual sadness. I'm in school and doing my homework. I'm so good in my public speaking class that I was offered a part time job if I get an A.

A woman hugged me and told me that 18 days was a big deal, and I'll never forget that kindness.

Over the past three years a lot of shit has happened. I got divorced, I've went to funerals for close friends, and I've dealt with some of the hardest challenges in my career (as an epidemiologist this past 18 months has been hell) and I've felt the totality of these things absolutely. I also forgave and have been forgiven, I've found love again, and I've developed a spiritual connection with the world. For the first time in my life I feel like I have a reason to be here, and for that I am thankful.

Life isn't always great, but I've found there's always hope. I am grateful to be who I am, and I don't think I would change a thing. I just wish I could go back and give my former self a hug, and tell that terrified person that he is deserving of love and compassion, and that there is a way through.

2021-09-24 21:07:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/puwjzy/being_alone_during_this_sucks/,Being Alone During this Sucks,My liver started hurting tonight. That's new. I'm living in a hotel with my two dogs on the other side of the country and am in physical pain right now and I can't think of anything to distract me or comfort me from it. I've been sick with some sort of cold for the last week and am still coughing so I dont feel comfortable going out anywhere crowded. I wish I could call someone to come over and watch a movie or something but I don't really know anyone here yet. Being alone has always been something that's bothered me. Even before I discovered alcohol I was miserable when I was wasn't in constant contact with someone. Alcohol just made me forget about feeling alone or gave me an excuse to sit at a bar around other people and not feel lonely. I feel like I'm slowly becoming agoraphobic after not leaving my house for anything for 2 years basically. I barely will even drive to pickup takeout even if I'm sober because door dash is so easy. I'm 48 hours sober. Getting through tomorrow is a problem for tomorrow. But if this sharp pain in my rib cage doesn't go away I think it'll be a strong reminder that alcohol is not for me anymore.,73,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.94522}"

This subreddit played a role in my liberation. Thank you.,"I spent years trying to solve the riddle of my alcohol addiction. I'm an avid researcher and I left no stone unturned. I can quote Roman historians and ancient  texts as to what they say about alcohol. I went to meetings, I checked in to a 30 day rehab. I read books and dabbled with all sorts of treatment techniques.

One thing I've always hated in life is getting played or taken advantage of. Becoming someone's mark. I pride myself on being able to spot bullshit from a mile away (at least I thought I could.)

When I stumbled on this forum broken and hungover. I kept seeing the recommendation to read *This Naked Mind*. Which I did. That's when, finally, the great mental shift happened. I was a mark! A fool getting played by alcohol, by the alcohol industry. A dependent filling the coffers of the liquor industry. I was my worst nightmare, a slave, and I didn't even realize it.

Everyone has their own route to sobriety. That was the key to mine. So thank you to this subreddit for giving me the toolset to pick the lock that was shackling me.

I remember for so long thinking ""How do I operate in this world without alcohol? It defines me. Its my social lubricant."" It felt so awkward thinking I had to endure the world without my beer. That mindset is now just a memory.

It wasn't until I sobered up that I was able to even recognize and start to face some abuse/trauma in my own family. My uncle drank until his organs gave out. My aunts both ended up in rehab. This goes back generations. My sister gave me a 12 pack of beer for my 16th birthday. When I went to rehab, no one from my family came to visit, and when I left no one ever asked me once ""how are you doing?""

My family looks like shiny happy people from the outside, but on the inside there is a lot of darkness. Nothing of substance is ever discussed and the alcohol seems to exist as the mat to sweep everything under.

The guy that thought he was savvy and street smart, was getting played by alcohol and his own family. Now I understand what Machiavelli meant by ‚Äúkeep your friends close, keep your enemies closer.‚Äù  I have screws in my foot. A scar on my face, but I survived! The two greatest enemies I never saw approaching. Alcohol and my own family.

The best thing about sobriety for me is the simplicity.  If I want to complicate my life. I know a simple recipe: just add alcohol.  It's a crazy world we live in. Happy to not be drinking with you today.",55,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47529966}"

Just wanted to remind anyone who has a bad relationship with alcohol that there is help beyond support groups like alcoholics anonymous. Whether you want to quit or cut back, there are medications and behavioral therapy options available. Naltrexone and Acamprosate decrease the desire to drink  even once you've had a couple and disulfiram is the big gun that makes it impossible to drink bc you'll vomit (for those who are truly committed --> it inhibits the enzyme required to breakdown alcohol in the liver). Don't be afraid to ask your doctor about these options or find an online doctor that will prescribe (there are many). If stigma or having it on your med record is something you are afraid of, online option is a good one or you can easily just say to your own doctor - hey I'd like to drink a little less and would like a script for naltrexone but don't want to go much into detail about how much I'm drinking / my relationship with it, they will understand. Naltrexone also comes in a once a month injection if you don't want to have to worry about taking a pill every day (it can also be taken as needed when you feel cravings).

2021-09-24 16:48:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pus9he/september_20_2021/,"September 20, 2021","At around 11pm, I took a shot of rum that finished off the bottle. Chased it with a Diet Coke as I am getting fairly chubby, probably due to the excessive drinking I‚Äôve been doing as my latest hobby. I looked at the bottle and saw what looked to be a couple of drops left. I poured in some Diet Coke to collect it and drank the rest. 

Afterwards, I thought to myself, why did I do that? Did I really need those few extra drops that badly? And that started a snowball of more questions. 

Why am I even drinking? I have a wife and two great kids and a stable, secure job, as does my wife, that allows us luxuries like owning a home, multiple cars and multiple vacations a year. 

What do I gain from drinking? I feel great while drinking. But all I get the next day is little to no energy for my kids or wife, and lately, I‚Äôve been suffering from poor work performance. If it weren‚Äôt for my union at work, I would have probably been let go a few weeks ago.

When did this even start? During the beginning of the pandemic, I was bored from not working. I was still getting paid, but had about 3 months of staying at home while my job figured out how to get most of us all working from home. After the first 2 months, I was feeling the monotony of being at home all day with my wife and kids and went and bought a 12 pack of beer.

Then I realized. After drinking beer, I started building up a tolerance and needed more to get the same feeling I was at the start. Starting earlier this year, I would start buying pints of tequila and rum. And then last month I started buying fifths and would finish those in 3-4 days. Up til a few days ago, I was drinking 5, 6 shots a night, and I think one weekend I had 8 shots in one night, and was going to the liquor store every couple days. It was starting to feel embarrassing as the clerk was starting to get to know me and would say ‚ÄúHello again‚Äù followed by my name. That was my first sign that this is not good.

Then a few nights ago, I was desperate enough to get the rest of the bottle in me, no matter how little is was. I knew it was time for a change.

So far, these past few days have been terrible. I have been sweating excessively, I felt like I was going to faint at a couple points, and I just felt empty. And the cravings were intense. I thought of alcohol when I woke up, when I showered, when I ate, while I‚Äôm working, while I‚Äôm with my family, and up til I close my eyes to go to sleep.

But on this fourth day, the cravings seem to have gone away. I‚Äôm waking up in the morning feeling great, I am not entirely full of energy like before, but I look forward to the day instead of dreading it like I did with a hangover.

I have had no problem cruising by the alcohol section previously.  This is why i take it hour by hour.  It has helped me tremendously to 'play if forward'.  I stood there and pictured what a 'harmless 6 pack of beer would do.......

i get beer with intention of having only a few,  but i keep going until my kids get home.  Then it's time to scatter beers in hidden places throughout the house.  I take several showers because the main hiding spot is in the bathroom.  I also brush my teeth several times (which i know does not mask the smell).  I start working on home projects because hiding spot #2 is in the garage.  I'm still drinking past my normal bed time, eventually passing out on the couch.  I crawl into bed with horrible sleep.  

It's the morning of my birthday and i'm hung over.   I gringe as i check social media posts and texts from last night.  I can't remember which hiding spots my beers are in, but i find a few warm beers.  Time for another shower while chugging warm beers.  The plan is to just feel better, but i end up going to the store (using an excuse) again for more. I just want to keep my buzz going.  My kids know exactly what is going on and the party they planned is ruined.  The cycle of regret, shame, and guilt enters my mind and so does more alcohol.  It's rinse and repeat until Monday where it's another day 1.  I'm ashamed to even check this sub.

2021-09-24 14:28:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pupoug/secrets/,Secrets,"Growing up my family was one filled with secrets.  My father was a self destructive drug addict who wasn‚Äôt afraid to be bring me, my mom and my brother down with him.  The words ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell your mother‚Äù, we‚Äôre spoken often.  When I was young, I followed those instructions.  

My Father overdosed 15 years ago, my mother is now retired and settling into old age and I am a new dad.  I‚Äôve never been able to overcome much of the chaos that was my childhood, but I have been able to live with it.  Getting sober helped me do that for sure.  

Recently I‚Äôve been having recurring nightmares, about my mom and my dad.  I wake up from them chilled to the bone, haunted.   My parents split when I was a teen because my dads use of heroin and amphetamines had taken on terrifying new heights.  But I still visited him every weekend, even when he was in homeless shelters, the hospital or halfway houses.  I honestly wish, that I didn‚Äôt  visit him.  That i had no contact with him, because he was out of his mind fucked on drugs and he did the most bat shit crazy things with me.  Things that put me in harms way, things that could have killed me.  But I always went back, every weekend. Sometimes my mom even dropped me off.  I never told anyone what was going on.  Ever.  I thought it was normal.  What I‚Äôve never been able to understand is: how my mom could have not seen what was going on?  

For a living, I‚Äôm a teacher.  I can usually tell when something is going on with a kid.  Why couldn‚Äôt my mom? As an adult I‚Äôve never been able to have a very close relationship with my mom.  To be honest it‚Äôs hard for me to get close to anyone.  But, especially my mom.  My mom never did anything hurtful to me, like my father, but she also wasn‚Äôt particularly helpful.  She never really called or came to visit me when I moved out.  She just want a big part of my life and I got used to that.  

Years ago, when she retired, my mom all of a sudden wanted to reconcile.  She wanted to talk on the phone every week and to go on vacations together etc‚Ä¶ While I‚Äôm not exactly opposed to building a relationship, I‚Äôm not enthusiastic about it and would prefer for it to happen more organically.  

I did tell her about what would happen when I would visit my dad and she acted so surprised and horrified.  I thought it would make me feel better to talk to my mom about these ‚Äúsecrets‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt, since then my mom has constantly told me about how guilty she feels and I just don‚Äôt give a shit.  I don‚Äôt exactly resent her.  I just don‚Äôt exactly feel close to her and her attempts at trying to ‚Äúheal‚Äù our relationship are actually hurtful, because I want to move on from my past and now on her terms she wants catharsis and healing, but when I was a teen and young adult and really needed someone to look out for me, she was completely aloof to what was plainly obvious.  That she was letting me spend time unsupervised with an unstable, dangerous drug addict.

Last year, when my wife was pregnant my mom was hospitalized while having a psychotic episode, it‚Äôs not the first time, it also happened when I was a kid.  While in the hospital my mom said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell your wife, I don‚Äôt want her to think it wouldn‚Äôt be safe for me to hold the baby‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt put too much stock into what she said and i can understand the root of her fear, but something inside me clicked and it took me far far far back.  Those words, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell‚Äù‚Ä¶

Since then, it‚Äôs become clear to her physician that she is suffering the early signs of dementia.  My mom, wants to be in my baby‚Äôs life, to an almost unhealthy degree.  My mom lives far away and weeps whenever she sees or hears my daughter on the phone.  She did come to visit, and it was a complete disaster.  My mom ended up leaving early.  Seeing her in person, it is very clear that she is profoundly unwell and is in denial about it.  The whole time, she wanted to talk about my childhood and her guilt.  I want to scream ‚Äúnot fucking fair‚Äù, and I tell her to stop.  But cognitively, she just can‚Äôt hear or remember what I‚Äôm telling her.  It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs living in an alternate reality, and she probably is.

I just don‚Äôt know, I feel so insane with emotions and what I feel is so incomprehensible to me.  I have a therapist who I‚Äôve seen for years.  Honestly the whole thing is just a nightmare and I don‚Äôt know how to get out of it.  I don‚Äôt want to write my mom off, but I‚Äôm also powerless to help her and also resent that she wants things from me but when I was young and needed things from her she was unavailable.  These feelings bring me back again to childhood, when I felt like I had to take care of my parent‚Äôs.  I hate it.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5947662}"

I had a sudden burst of sudden, eye opening sobriety after years of bandaging up my problems with alcohol. I got to the stage where anything seemed like the tallest mountain to overcome. Everything triggered me to want to drink. Sometimes rock bottom comes in many forms. I thought I had been there many times myself throughout the past 5 years after so many embarrassing drunken scenarios, a DUI, making my family sick and worried about where I am after midnight on so many occasions, and ruining several great relationships or possible future relationships. Long story short, there was an incident a few months ago that changed me. I met a really great person at work, and let's be honest, making friends as an adult in your boss-stage alcoholism isn't easy. So obviously I was so excited to get to know this person. We hung out outside of work, had a great day, and I was on top of the world that day. Well guess what? I had such a great day that I decided to celebrate with drinks at home, which lead me to an anxiety induced, embarrassingly long text message that I sent that I wrote out to this person about why this probably wont work. Alcohol causes me to make-up and stress about scenarios and problems that haven't even happened yet.. The next day I contemplated sending it, all while totally sober. And eventually I did.  I ruined another great friendship/relationship because I was an insecure mess that believed he didn't deserve good things. Shocker. It ruined what potentially could have been amazing. That week, I laid in bed crying everyday wondering why everything is so awful. But deep down I knew the answer to that. I was just too afraid to give up the alcohol because I didn't know what I was going to rely on for ANYTHING. It all just clicked in that moment. Every bad thing and every bad feeling I have been feeling has been because of my drinking. At that moment I knew what I had to do for myself. I told myself out loud, ""you can't afford to lose any more good things."" There was no question or hesitation. I woke up August 27th with a new outlook on life, and 31 days later I'm sitting here feeling more in control of my life than ever. And guess what? All that depression and anxiety has been lifted. I feel so at peace and I regret wasting those years wondering why I was the way I was. Alcohol put me in this feedback loop of depression and anxiety that was so hard to break out of. Sometimes rock bottom comes in different forms, but I'm glad I hit it. And I'm so glad that this was the situation that pulled me out of this ""feedback loop from hell"" as Mark Manson called it. Thank you all for reading, and I'm so excited to be here.  


Here's the stuff I absolutely do not miss!!  
\-Waking up at 3am in a panic wondering what you did or who you drunk texted  
\-Being so hungover you're barfing up nothing but yellow in the shower.  
\-Planning your nights around getting drunk  
\-That horrible fluttery feeling in your heart when you're struggling to get through work hungover the next day  
\-Figuring out what liquor store you didn't hit that day so they don't judge you  
\-Trying to explain to someone ""what you meant"" in that stupid text you sent that made no sense, and trying to figure out a lie so that they didn't know you were drunk texting.  
\-constantly worrying about how red your eyes look  
\-Trying to piece together the night and wondering where that bruise came from  
\-Telling yourself after every binge, ""this is the last time"" and lying to yourself about it  
\-Constantly worrying about how you could have hurt someone  
\- Constantly worrying if someone can smell the booze on you (well guess what THEY DO)

I think I finally caught up on sleep from all the drunk AF not sleep I've had over the years. 80 days ago I thought I was gonna die. Literally. It took over a week to be able to eat any food. I really wrecked myself. I was drinking daily and would put down 2 pints of vodka at least each day. I was bearly able to function in my job and with my home life. 

I've tried to stop multiple times in the past and have had many, many ""day ones."" This is the time I'm going to do it for good. That was (I realize now) my rock bottom. In the past I tried meds to help me (Vivitrol and campral) and they did help at times for sure. This time I'm not using meds (although I have taken several small doses of psilocybin) and am doing it with my own will power.

Since day one, I've come super far. I'm back to killing it at work, (I own my own business) my wife isn't super pissed at me all the time and can trust me again, and we just put in an offer to buy our first home!

I've been drinking heavily since I was 17 and I'm 34 now. I grew up with alcohol in my family and had my first taste as an infant. My mom would rub brandy on my gums when I was teething. If I can make it out of this hole, so can you! To anyone wanting to make a change to sobriety, don't be afraid. It is possible. And, if you fail (like I said I've tried to quit countless times) get right back up and keep trying.

I'm feeling pretty good at the moment (barring the obligatory debilitating guilt and shame) as I took yesterday to taper down from the wreckage of another bender. 

This last one started Sunday after a beautiful 6.5 mile run. I felt great, so why not have all the drinks starting at 1PM? Monday morning I felt like the usual kindled death and quickly had a few 7AM drinks to right the ship. That of course led to a full day of drinking, blacking out, not getting much work done, and passing out on the floor. Tuesday was essentially a repeat, as was Wednesday.

Not too bad, all things considered, but this was on the heels of my last bender which was Sunday through Thursday of the previous week, which basically looked the same. 1 day of a bad decision leading to three more days of heavy drinking and debilitating withdrawals. 

Before this I'd been sober for three weeks (because I had a solid four-day binge right before that). And this has pretty much been my story for two years now -- a couple day bender followed by 2-4 weeks of sobriety, rinse and repeat. 

I've been trying to do better and not drink every day, but once I started cutting back, when I do drink I'm all in and it never ends well. And recently I've developed horrible withdrawals that I assume are the result of awesome kindling where I feel so terrible the next day I'm all but forced to start drinking again to just feel some semblance of normal. There is absolutely no moderation option.

I can't do this anymore. I hate it. My productivity at work is all over the place. My wife hates this. My kids are starting to ask more questions. The night sweats are getting worse. It's only a matter of time before everything comes crashing down. 

So here's to day one. I love this sub and participated here a few years ago when I first started cutting down from every day drinking, and it was a great resource. I got a lot of benefit out of posting daily, so that's my commitment -- 100 posts in 100 days.

this community is a reminder that we're not alone in all of this. and an invaluable resource for those of us who are looking for alternatives to traditional 12 step programs or other abstinence and faith-based approaches.

personally i've had the most negative effects in my life stem from drinking, any other use or abuse stems from alcohol. i still got a long ways to go for sure. But there really is so much in my life I have been able to create space for as a result of not drinking and you all have had a role in that just by being here and sharing your stories.

As much as I really want to say ""who cares"" and not post anything, I see how important it is to contribute to here as an OP as well as in the comments section, I'm putting my ego aside and making myself vulnerable by sharing.

The things I've gained - I've been able to restructure a lot of my relationships and find new fun things to do with friends that don't center around drinking. But I've also learned that I can still have a good night out with friends, without booze. The money I haven't spent on alcohol I can spend on other things. I got a great girlfriend and a dog and we're talking about getting engaged (the girl, not the dog) and since she's not much of a drinker I feel this is the first real romantic relationship in my life that we've been able to build a personal bond, not one that centers around alcohol.

The things I've lost - many of the relationships i've had that were very focused around alcohol were unfortunately difficult to continue with. Some of those friends are struggling themselves and I'm sure they'll come around. I've also finally started to lose a little weight (don't give up, the first year I gained weight too, and more recently i've been able to work on making better eating habits for myself)

None of this happened overnight! It's difficult when you first start off and you want everything to just fall into your lap. Well I'll just say keep doing the work and before you know it you'll be impressed by what you can achieve.

I met a new friend for dinner last night. She hasn‚Äôt been in the city for very long so asked me to pick a place. Perfect! We planned to meet at an awesome dumpling spot that doesn‚Äôt have alcohol on the menu. I was proud of myself for choosing this and felt little anxiety about meeting her.

However when we got there, she mentioned she had passed through a street fair in Little Italy on her way and asked if we could head over there instead. I really didn‚Äôt want to end up at an overpriced tourist trap of a restaurant there, and I really really did not want to be confronted by a wine list, but this was my first time hanging out socially with this person (we were colleagues this summer) and I felt weird saying I wanted/needed to stick with the original plan.

Sure enough, it started pouring and we ended up at the nearest overpriced tourist trap with mediocre food (can you tell I‚Äôm bitter? Lol). She ordered a glass of red wine‚Ä¶and I followed suit. I could have stuck with water or gotten a Diet Coke or told her I‚Äôm on antibiotics or whatever. But I didn‚Äôt. I was starving and anxious and a little annoyed and I caved. The whole time I was drinking it, I kept thinking about how I needed to come clean to my husband when I got home.

As we finished up, she asked how I felt about doing some shots. Something clicked‚Äîdrinking or not, my shot-taking career has long been over‚Äîand I felt no urge to drink anymore at all. We went to one bar after dinner and I discreetly ordered a seltzer while she was in the bathroom. We enjoyed great conversation throughout the night, and obviously she had no idea I‚Äôve been trying to get sober, but I was disappointed that our ideas of fun didn‚Äôt really align. (My idea of fun is eating my weight in soup dumplings and being tucked into bed by 9.)

When I finally got home, I told my husband the truth. I‚Äôve often been dishonest with him about my drinking, so this felt good. I also feel a renewed effort to set better boundaries.

I sort of stopped counting days, but I jump in here every now and again to keep myself on the straight and narrow., when my badge reminds me of my number of days alcohol free.

For all of you who are just starting this journey, we were all here before you.  I was at the lowest of my low not all that long ago.  Just about every waking day, the persistent thought in the back of my mind was, 'when can I have another drink?'.   I never lost a job, never had a DUI, didn't lose my family, but I was in bad shape in many ways.  On the outside, even to many close to me, I was ''fine', but that wasn't the case.

I was self-harming on occasion, and had suicidal thoughts frequently.  Alcohol had my brain totally messed up, not to mention the high blood pressure, irregular heart beat, horrible sleep patterns...the list goes on.

I found my own reasons to stop.  I wanted to get healthy, I needed to stop ignoring the troubles in my life, and I was tired of being sick and hung over almost every day.  In hindsight, I was in a pretty bad cycle. 

It's not that stopping drinking 'cured' everything, but it did totally clear my head.  I am rational, and clear thinking (at least most of the time).  I perform much better at work, I've learned  things on new topics and subjects that I knew nothing about before, and realized that I actually like learning new things.  

Physically, my blood pressure and heart are in great shape, and my sleep has improved significantly.  I had NO IDEA what an improved and steady sleep cycle can do to improve your physical and mental well being. 

I started running for the first time in my life just a few months ago, and have recently hit the 5k milestone.  I won't win any races, but it is a huge personal accomplishment, and being able to run even a short distance without panting and gasping for breath feels great.

Anyway, all this to say, if I can do it, anyone can.  I am no different or better than anyone else.  If you want to quit, just keep trying, like I did.  Find your motivation, and do it for yourself. 

You don't have to quit forever,  just don't drink today.  Tell yourself that every day.

I was a junkie for many years and got clean in 2013. Kicking that habit was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Until now... Alcohol is EVERYWHERE and LEGAL. Temptation is in my face everyday and it's making me want to turn into a hermit so I don't have to face it.

We are both ready to quit. He's pre-diabetic now and I have gained about 25 or 30 lbs from my drinking the past 2 years. Our health is declining and our mental health is too.

My husband is going to AA a few times a week. AA and NA never worked for me. It only amplifies the cravings for me. Even when I kicked heroin and meth, they just weren't for me. I have a support group and throwing myself back into jogging has helped immensely. I know there is a long journey ahead, but I'm happy I'm not doing it alone.

My husband cried and begged me for a six pack last night. I refused. We fought and we both cried. He ended up mad and I went to bed alone with all the car keys, cash, and cards we have. He woke up apologetic, but it was still really hard for me to be the strong one.

It brought me out of my shell in social situations. It gave me a wonderful, relaxed, warm buzz. It made me feel like my ideal self had emerged - confident, charming, witty and totally comfortable in my skin. It vanquished that shy and awkward guy who preferred to just stay quiet in the corner.  Gatherings with friends became wonderful, bright, joyful bonding experiences.  I can‚Äôt overstate how much I needed that sense of connection. 

But like the cliche goes, it was awesome - until it wasn‚Äôt. 

I repeatedly found myself just sitting in front of the TV pouring glass after glass of vodka until I got buzzed every night, for years. My daily workouts were negated by the VAST amounts of empty calories ingested from alcohol.  My digestive system was in shambles, and I‚Äôm still trying to get that back to normal. 

I was self-effacing and poked fun at it. Took pics of my freezer filled with vodka bottles and shared it on social media as a joke. 

A couple of weeks ago while drinking, the thought occurred to me that drinking myself to death would probably not be such a bad way to go. 

I had a ‚Äúdark night of the soul‚Äù (of sorts)  crisis last week and decided I don‚Äôt want to be that guy anymore.

Fortunately, I don‚Äôt feel any physical cravings or withdrawal yet, but I do think about it a lot.  The ritual of the martini shaker, the icy burn of the steel in my hand as I tilted it, the anticipation of the treat.  I would sure like to enjoy s Chianti with some pasta, an IPA with fish and chips  and champagne during celebrations, but that seems to lead down the same path. One glass is never going to be enough.

The idea of not drinking any alcohol for the rest of my life just seems impossible. I have friends whom have been successfully doing it for decades, but I‚Äôm keenly aware that this is NOT just a one-time decision.

I keep reading here about that ‚Äúclever voice‚Äù which tries to somehow talk you out of sobriety, and I recognize it.  It‚Äôs fucking relentless.

‚ÄúYou know this isn‚Äôt going to work, right? Just like the other times. Why even pretend?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just try moderating like when you first started?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow about we just do one week on and one week off to give your system a break.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs going to get weird again at social gatherings - is it even worth going?‚Äù

And on, and on, and on ‚Ä¶

I smile and call him out in recognition whenever he pops in my head.

I don‚Äôt do other substances and am otherwise in good health. So far, I'm feeling good and am losing weight. I‚Äôm looking for other tasty low-cal drinks to replace it with since I‚Äôm finding myself downing far too much artificially sweetened soda.  I love tea, but there‚Äôs only so much of that one can drink per day. 

What has personally worked for you?  Pelegrino? Flavored seltzer? Other? Regular water is not going to do the trick.

Would appreciate any recommendations from personal experiences.

Saturday spun wildly out of control and by the wee hours of Sunday morning (so I'm told) I was literally growling and flexing and living out some subconscious Godzilla/Kong fantasy, between bouts of weeping and remodeling the drywall. It was bad, suffice to say, and hardly the first episode. Though I had no control when I was drinking I was not, however, a habitual drinker‚Äînot long enough anyway. I quit drinking every day about a year out of college (five years ago now) and relegated it to just the weekends. I‚Äôve never experienced withdrawals, but I've also blacked out \*hundreds\* of times. So I reason that physiological dependency is not my primary obstacle‚Äîego and rage are. 

Which brings me back to AA. I‚Äôm an atheist and I‚Äôm trying not to bristle at the religious ideology sandwiched between every deli-slice of advice in the Big Book. But there are aspects of it I can‚Äôt abide‚Äînamely the extremely circular logic involved. According to the BB, anyone who fails to swallow every last tenant is doomed to fail at their sobriety. Therefore, to disagree with AA ideology is to prove it correct. Which is the very definition of circular logic. I know that there are countless success stories, and I‚Äôm not knocking that; but there are countless failure stories, too. AA, by my reckoning, is batting about 50/50. They have simply codified their program such that failures reinforce their prescription just as much as successes do, but there are plenty of people who believed every tenant and also relapsed. 

Additionally, ‚ÄòWe Agnostics‚Äô is pretty condescending. It reads about like ‚ÄúIf only you stupid atheists will believe, you‚Äôll get sober. See? pRoOf!‚Äù They lump atheism under the umbrella term agnosticism, which seems like a fundamental misunderstanding of both viewpoints. Then they sidestep the issue by appending an ‚Äòas you understand Him‚Äô after every ‚ÄòGod,‚Äô but it‚Äôs nonetheless blatant Christianity here. A lot of times it gets softened to a simple ‚ÄòHigher Power‚Äô but the euphemism hardly conceals the point. A recurring motif in the literature is this ‚ÄòWho am *I* to say there is no God?‚Äô epiphany one of the (previously atheist) authors had. Well, I ask who are you to tell me what I have to believe? No offense to anyone that this works for, it just doesn‚Äôt work for me. This is the stuff that made my previous attempts half-hearted.

Here it is on Day 3. I cannot believe that I was so afraid to quit. I know this is still early, but I cannot believe how depressed and down I was over such a long period of time (extremely down as of last week through the day before I decided to quit) and even 60 hours in sober as of this post, I feel completely different! I was so afraid of withdrawals, but I finally said f' it and so glad I did. I have been eating like there is no tomorrow and gained 2 pounds so far, but I am good with that! Everything I have been eating is healthy (minus the Banana Foster Smoothie I got at the end of Day 1, lol), so I am okay. Last night at about 8:00pm, I went to Kroger because I realized we ran out of milk, then proceeded to the ice cream section and picked up some Keto ice cream.....would never have been able to or want to do that last weekend even, because I would have been drunk out of my mind. 

I have had some withdrawal symptoms like sweating throughout the day randomly (sort of like hot flashes and break out in a sweat) and needed to get in front of a fan for a few minutes, some anxiety attacks; however, no shakes thus far, and I have been sleeping like crazy. I know that my body is working hard to repair itself, even this soon, so I will sleep when I need to sleep. I am still a little bit nervous as I have not hit the 72-hour mark yet, and I am sure some more withdrawal symptoms may come, but for now, they really have not been that bad at all. In the past when I quit, it seemed to be much worse for the first few days, and this is what I expected, but I have not had too bad of withdrawal symptoms so far. 

I keep reading and found that there are people that have had a rock bottom moment, which is when they knew they needed to quit alcohol for good. I am not sure if I really had a defining rock bottom moment; rather, a series of moments that convinced me that I needed to kick this to the curb, as I am positive others have had as well.

I'm glad to be back on the sober train & already enjoying a little more calm in the face of his entirely normal shenanigans. I'm also noticing how angry my husband is over everything (still drinking).

Thank you for keeping me sober, you really do.  

  
I just thought I'd mull this one over with you, as it's not something I see talked about a lot here, maybe referred to obliquely... but honestly, I have kissed a lot of people I shouldn't have kissed when I was wasted.  Now, I own it, it wasn't the drink that did the kissing, it was me, I still like kissing, whatever, but I sure as hell don't risk my own and other people's hearts the way I used to.  My behaviour was pretty SLAA-y, and it's a huge relief that I've left all that behind.  My friends will occasionally mourn ""my crazy stories"", but I don't.  Although at the time it felt important to my identity to be 'sexually confident', I also carried a lot of shame about not treating other people's relationships as carefully as I should have.

I suppose this is a shout out to anyone who feels like... the crazy and unpredictable heart of the night will be lost... well, yes, but also, when you're really honest with yourself, how good do you feel about how crazy things get?

Last Friday I listed some things I was doing to stay sober. 

So I wanted to post a couple things I learned this week through my sobriety.

1. Listen to my body. Shit I've been tired this week. Is it all the exercise? The waking up early? The stress of work. I don't know, but a couple of days this week I listened and went to bed earlier and took it easy. 
2. Reflection. I'm in therapy.  I go every two weeks. We talk about different stuff and now that I feel really clear I try my best to reflect on things she brings up to me. My co dependency. The one sided relationships I've had. How I don't think about my needs until everyone else's have been met. So I've been focused on that and on myself.
3. Feeling my feelings. Ugh this. Sometimes at the end of the day I'm tired and I get irritated. I feel these feelings.  Try to pinpoint them and take some quiet time for myself.  
4. Reading. I'll be honest.  Sometimes I get annoyed that alot of my life is focused on my sobriety.  The books I read, podcasts I listen to...and so on. At the end of the night I journal but then I read a fiction book. It's nice just to relax my brain

Anyway.  Thanks for reading and Happy Friday! The weekends aren't easy, but stick with it. By Sunday afternoon you'll be happy you did!",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.40593505}"

So for that I am grateful.

As an add to all of that. Kind of a psa that it's always important to be honest with your doctor about how much you drank or are drinking. They're there to help and not judge. Our disease can reek havoc on our bodies so they need to know honestly what to look for.

When I finally made it a whole month, and then 24 more days on top of that, it felt like a monumental achievement. I had never made it more than a week, in 20 years of heavy drinking. 

Then I tested the waters of field research (bad idea). Then my girlfriend dumped me. I fell back in with complete self abandon. Drowned myself again for weeks.

This time around, 60 goddamn days, it just feels like living. Real, honest to God living, free from the overwhelming urge to come home and drink my evenings away every single night.

As the title says, I'm on attempt 3 of getting sober! This time, though, I've been reading all your stories on this sub. It's helped immensely.

I just made it through day 4, and withdrawal symptoms have started to ease up a bit! I feel great! Well.. not normal person great, but as great as an all-day-every-day alcoholic can feel while recovering. My appetite has come back, I feel a little less anxious and I don't feel so achey. It's amazing. 

Now, with all the above being said.. I have a couple appearance-related questions. I'm just wondering if anyone has had experience with hair thinning/loss. Out of nowhere a few weeks back, my hair started coming out in clumps. My hair strands seem to have randomly thinner. I try and brush them and they just break right off. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? If so, how long before it better in your experience? I know it sounds vain, but no woman wants to lose her hair at 28.

My other question is about eye appearance. Did anyone notice any difference in their eyes while drinking vs. After a period of being sober? My eyes seem to look so lifeless. My whites are not longer bright, and my one bottom eyelid has started to look a little droopy.

Thank you to anyone who made it through that! Sorry it was kind of a jumbled mess of thoughts. I feel like I need to mention that I'm not looking for any medical advice or anything, just experiences! 

Thank you all for being there through your stories! Hopefully 3rd times the charm! :D

I'm working on 109 days without a drink. I was scared and hopeless before I went to rehab. Scared my wife would still divorce me, scared I'd never stay sober, scared to confront my mental health issues that led me to my level of drinking. 

My wife still divorced me, and that's ok. Life presents us with loads of choices and opportunities and up until that moment in my life I made the wrong ones. I made it past 30, 60, and 90 days. It wasn't fun, it wasn't easy, but I was able to do it and everything might not be easy but it is doable.

I'm not going to call this my success, because I still have years and years to go. But It's a very positive work in progress. I've surrounded myself with supportive people, tossed toxic relationships, and started cultivating proper ones. I'm taking charge of what I can in my life. I'm not blaming my negative emotions and traits on anyone else.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Could exercise for longer, lost weight more easily, more energy, etc. But I decided still, those two days were too much. So I'm down to 1 day a week that I drink AT ALL. I cannot casually drink, so I literally dont have a sip of alcohol for 6 days in a row.

And for obvious reasons it all weighs so much heavier when the fall weather sets in.

It‚Äôs not really about how others perceive me (I realize alcohol has only negatively impacted that), but it‚Äôs more about envisioning my ideal future life, enjoying the things I love, and it‚Äôs really hard to see that without IPAs on the river bank, a glass of whiskey by the grill, beers after skiing etc.

These associations (no-doubt created by decades of marketing and a culture that romanticizes the masculine male alcoholic) are probably what got me here in the first place, but how can a guy simultaneously be Ernest Hemingway, Rooster Cogburn, and Don Draper without that defining accessory (yes, I know the booze served these 3 poorly).

I'm a 24F, newly alcohol free! I quit hard drugs (meth heroin and whatever I could find) 5 years ago September 10th, with the exception of pot and alcohol. Though I still smoke pot I quit drinking alcohol August 29th this year because I got tired of the anxiety of planning how I was gonna get my next drink, when my partner was working so I could drink (he's been sober for 3 years), how to not LOOK drunk, and scheduling what days I could drink so I wasn't an ""alcoholic"". Let's not even talk about the dread and embarrassment of what I could have done the night before. Either way I have been loving being alcohol free. Though I've had cravings, I've steered clear and overcome them with a cup of tea or some crunches, I am really scared for this weekend. 

My partner travels occasionally for work and this weekend he will be gone until Sunday morning. Normally your girl would be jumping for joy because I could drink how I want when I want without judgment (really just concern).

Hey guys,

To provide a quick update to all the folks who shared kind and encouraging words to me a couple of days ago, I am still sober. 

I know it's still very fresh and I'm still heavily going through the process of bargaining thoughts and urges to drink, but I've been able to keep my hands busy after work each night and also reading to keep my mind stimulated. 

Giving up alcohol as a new years resolution for 2020 was a bit easier and I had more support in front of me to keep me motivated. This time around, it's been harder and I anticipate it to be much harder than before because of being physically alone. What I like is that I've been thinking and reflecting a lot on my last sober stint and it's brought me the moments of peace I need to fight the urges to just go grab one or two shooters..

Thank you all for the support and love a couple days ago. You all are amazing people and I'm where I need to be to get through this.

I‚Äôve been going to festivals for over ten years at this point and they‚Äôve always been heavy drinking events for me.  I‚Äôve ruined many festival days blacking out and hungover. I was incredibly nervous going into it, wondering if I‚Äôd have as much fun, if I‚Äôd be able to say no, if I could take psychedelics without the ‚Äúpre trip buzz‚Äù to calm my nerves. I actually ended up having a pretty profound experience throughout the whole thing and realized a few things. 1) it was way easier to keep it going late into the night without alcohol. 2) after turning down a couple times people stop asking if you want a drink 3) nobody cares if you drink or not 4) the little amounts of sleep I did get were much better 5) the effects of the other substances were much more pronounced, giving me overall better experiences and 6) I actually remember every set I saw

Was it easy the whole time? No. I wanted to drink really bad a few times. But, I came out of the weekend with a completely different perspective on music festivals and a much deeper understanding of myself.

Really, it's been just a bender for the last two weeks since Pops got fired. Started with just a couple glasses of whiskey with football, then the firing and stress that came with, hiding the secret from my brother, etc. I had told myself I was going to stop before I fell all the way back in, but here I am, back in the deep end.

I want to stop, but I'm afraid that I'm physically addicted and will go through withdrawals again. I can deal with the sweats and high blood pressure and shit sleep, but the anxiety and possibility of seizures is what makes it so hard. I cancelled a Dr's appointment yesterday because I felt like shit and it felt like I'd be wasting their time to go and have them see I've made no progress. The whole goal was to get off drinking and get a lower baseline Blood pressure, and last time I was there, I had been sober for a week or so and it was already back to healthy levels.

I know I need to quit and schedule a new appointment and apply for that job, but the withdrawals seem so insurmountable. I only have two of my librium left, and while I put in a refill request for my BP meds last friday, I still haven't heard anything from the pharmacy. I'm going to need both of those to make it through withdrawal again. And I don't want to ask my doctor for more librium because I don't want them thinking I'm just seeking pills. I'm not, I'm seeking the med to keep me alive and sane through the first 3-5 days of withdrawals. 

All that said, I'm going to try this thing again. Saving the librium for day 3 or so, as that's when shit's really hairy. Hoping the BP meds come through in the next day or so, too. Going to try to just stay distracted with walking, video games, and lurking/posting here if I get really bad.

Days pass where I don't think about alcohol, but they still have an edge of ""now what?"" lacing them.  I was diagnosed as bipolar and manic depressive some years ago, and the Lithium I was taking was rendered, if not useless, then unpredictable by my drinking.  Now, being sober, I feel like I can finally feel what the Lithium is actually doing, and it's been an adjustment.  The alcohol provided me with chemical highs to combat the predictable lows, and its absence seems to deny my brain the rollercoaster it's used to.  Instead, I have what feels like dulled emotions, but they may just be ""normal"" emotions.  None of this makes me want to drink, but it is a new experience.

My wife has been incredibly supportive.  While I would never ask her to be sober also, she has cut back substantially (with annoying ease, I might add).  Watching her support me by not drinking as much has put my own addiction in sharp relief- she's able to do what I cannot.  She can think about alcohol without craving intoxication.  She can have 1 or 2 and be satisfied.  I cannot, which is why I'm here.  I am eternally grateful for her patience and understanding.

And wherever I can I try to add some wee words of encouragement. I used to think I understood when you would talk about friends and family being resentful of your journey and how hard that was to deal with.

I‚Äôve always had a fractured relationship with my family since my mum died 19 years ago, and my older siblings decided they wanted nothing to do with me after I went through some hard times. Then at the start of this year I was severely injured in an attack that left me with PTSD, anxiety and multiple visible injuries. I didn‚Äôt leave the house for nearly four months and only recently have I started going out again.

Today I went for lunch with my dad and was so excited to tell him about how much better I was feeling. Not only were the anti-anxiety drugs finally settling in but I was nearly two weeks sober and feeling amazing. Instead of spending money on alcohol to forget about how much the attack had changed me, I was spending money on furniture that I built myself and was doing DIY around the house. I told him how I was planning to do Sober October to raise money for a cancer charity in the UK and I was overly excited to tell him about how much better I was doing with my business and how many new contracts I had.

Apparently this much good news isn‚Äôt great for those that are supposed to love you the most! And just like many people on this sub have shared in their experiences, instead of support and genuine relief that I was feeling better, I was met with ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre a bit too hyper today eh? Why are you being so loud?‚Äù. Then he just started telling me some random story about his partners daughter and what she was doing and I could literally feel myself retreating back into my mental shell of anxiety and just feeling completely deflated. Oh and he also told me he would wait until the end of October to sponsor me for Sober October because there was no way I could make it a whole month.

I felt so bad that I ordered a beer. Yeah, I know ‚Äì but after tasting just one sip of it I realised what a mistake I had made. I left the rest of the pint, came straight home, stuck the kettle on and got out my emergency box of maltesers. Honestly, fuck everyone that doesn‚Äôt understand just how hard it is to even be yourself sometimes without the mask of alcohol hiding everything you‚Äôre feeling.

Anyway, that was a rant and a half haha ‚Äì thanks for coming to my ted talk, and thank you for sharing all of your stories because I was able to recognise what was happening. If I didn‚Äôt know what to expect I would be sitting here with a few beers absolutely distraught and destroying all my progress.

I started experiencing these things for the first time this year during a stretch of strong sobriety.

 At first I thought it was sleep apnea and that my drinking just masked the symptoms because I was so sedated. I made an appointment to get checked out and he checked me out and said he didn't think it was that and prescribed me allergy and asthma medicine because it was a bad ""allergy season"" I didn't think that was what was going on but I tried it. Until one night I slipped up and drank a bunch. I noticed that I didn't have that problem.. I didn't lie to my doctor, I lied to myself. I told myself it was just my diagnosed anxiety disorder getting worse it couldn't be just the alcohol. So I told him I think its more like an anxiety attack than allergies. He prescribed me anti depressants and told me to give them a month or two and see if that helps. 


They have helped a lot. During the day things that would normally make me want to drink to calm down don't seem so bad but I'm currently six weeks in and... well the night time panic attacks still hit when I don't drink. In fact, the past 4-5 times I've drank have been solely to avoid that racing heart feeling of dying on nights where I have to be in bed for work. 

My question is, have any of you ever talked to your doctor about alcohol issues in a fully honest and open way? I feel like I should because treatment options might be different.

Im sitting here at my home office working, and just realizing theres probably no point to trying to do anything really. Hopefully you guys can help me change the rails on this train of thought. so let me just brain vomit for a moment...

most every article I read these days tells me that the earth is going to be a fireball in about 50 years, ill be 77, if i make it that far in the first place. with that being said, the whole world seems to be on the brink of WW3. thankfully im one year too old to get drafted to my knowledge, but still i just dont feel like living through that. not to mention, covid is bottom line not going anywhere. there is no light at the end of that tunnel. i dont mind wearing a mask, ive actually found it avoids a lot of those awkward conversations when someone recognizes you from high school and feels like while youre trying to buy some apple juice is a good time to catch up on 7 years. with that being said, politics aside, im also vaccinated, so im not really worried about getting it myself. its just that looming cloud over everything i do is still there.. 

and with all that being said.. the world is so divided as well, with no clear end in sight. even in my household, it seems like everyone has some opinion that they are steadfast on defending, going as far as becoming violent. im genuinely concerned my parents are going to tip over the edge at some point in the future and join the chaos. 

so not only is there a climate crises we really cant do anything about, a pandemic we really cant do anything about, a world full of people that want to hurt eachother, but also all the personal problems im trying to overcome. social anxiety i never had before. i have a video call with a therapist tomorrow and im... nervous? about it. never felt that way before. getting drunk every night to forget everything. wasting money on random things on amazon trying to make myself feel happy i guess. all of that with the worlds problems that while technically arent my problems, do absolutely affect me, just seems like too much. like i want to be done worrying about everybody else, but im afraid if i stop then ill be unprepared when the world inevitably falls apart. 

sorry for the negativity in this post btw. im just trying to find a reason to quit drinking, a why. i just dont see it. i understand this is a healthy mindset.. but am i wrong? am i crazy for thinking the worlds gone to hell, and i just happened to be born at the wrong time? im going to be 27 tomorrow and im still 24 in my head, working at best buy having a great time with my buddies there. finishing up college, going on regular hikes, living a pretty good life not gonna lie. the past 2 years are just a blur that never really happened. i could get existential but i feel this post is already negative enough.

Have any of you had experience around OCD and drinking episodes? I have worked very hard to cut down on my drinking in hopes of becoming abstinent. Sadly, there have been some episodes over the past few months where I have had too much to drink. With each of these episodes, I spiral into a weeks-long worry cycle. For example, recently I went to a concert and had several beers. I got home and had to fix my cell phone which had broken earlier. I ate something, watched a movie and went to bed. However, about a week later I had a full on panic that what if I did something bad on my way home and didn't remember. There's no proof for any of it and through checking my internet history I obviously went straight home and my night went on as I remember. 

I know the only solution is to stop drinking and, likely, seek therapy but I would love to hear any of your experiences and if these symptoms subsided when going fully sober.

First, I would like to start off saying, **THANK YOU**, to all of you awesome people of r/stopdrinking, for all of the support you have given everyone attempting to quit and encouraging everyone to keep going, without judgment and just to be there!

It is officially day 2! I know this is still early, but it is the first official day without alcohol in over 2.5 years since my last attempt. I feel great this morning! From what I remember before, this day is worse than day 1 by far. I have been AF for 36 hours, so far, as of this posting. I realize that days 2 and 3 are usually far worse, but I am here for it!

I just wanted to note that this time around I have done something different than my last attempts and I feel that it has made a significant difference in my withdrawals and wellbeing so far, in case it could help someone else who is also trying to quit. I realize everyone is different, and each withdrawal is different, but for me, this has made a difference; especially, in comparison to my attempts before where withdrawals have gotten worse each time. I will try to not let this be such a long post, but here goes...

I have been on Keto for a long time now and drank Vodka and low/zero carb hard seltzers so that I could still lose weight, which I did; however, I realized that I was not eating as much and it wasn't healthy (nutrients not getting). Like drinking the way I did, was any healthier??? Anyway, about a couple of weeks ago, I decided to get some essential supplements that I felt I was missing from my diet, plus I knew that drinking drained me of important vitamins/minerals. I had read in numerous places that it is uncertain how many of each vitamin/mineral there actually are in multivitamins, so I opted to purchase from various manufacturers that are reputable and tested, the individual vitamins that I knew I was missing from my diet, plus I did not want all of the other vitamin/herbs in a multivitamin that I may not need. I am not saying that multivitamins are definitely not the way to go, but this was just my preference. 

At first, when I began taking the supplements, I felt better than I did when not taking them but I wasn't consistent....this was when I was still drinking. It has been about four days since I had taken them last and yesterday I decided to start up again, since I felt it could help with the effects of not drinking and also to add nutrients back, but went out and added 2 more as I read they do help with some of the effects of stopping drinking. This is definitely not an infomercial, lol (it kind of sounds like it after I reread, but truly this is something that has made an impact for me thus far). Here is the list of everything I have been taking, in case you are interested.....also, I read a few places that Kudzu Root can assist quite a few people to lose their desire to drink and this is the first one that I started taking when trying to quit a couple of weeks ago (yes, it did make a difference, but was not a miracle herb....at least it was natural and it did help to an extent to reduce the amount of drinks). 

**Vitamins, A, B-Complex, C, D3, E, K, COQ10, Zinc, Collagen Peptides, and added Milk Thistle (to help with liver), and Magnesium Citrate (helps to restore levels and with some of the withdrawal symptoms when quitting).**  

I did eat salmon, pork, strawberries, pickles and asparagus yesterday, but broke down and got a 24oz Banana Foster smoothie from WAWA (was wonderful as I have not had sweets in a long, long time, lol!) I do feel much better with hardly any cravings so far.....So much for not trying to create a long post!  

Thank you for listening to my rant and musings. I am just trying to give anyone some suggestions in case they are struggling, in case it may help them quit if they are having trouble I guess we will see how days 2 and 3 go with the withdrawals I encounter while continuing the supplements and eating well. 

Once again, thank you to everyone for the support! It is greatly appreciated.

Are you ready to accept that change?""","A drug counsellor asked me that when I was in treatment. He held a whole lecture about it, and I didn't understand then, but I think I may be closer now.

The difference between being chemically clean and sober is change, yes? Simply removing the alcohol rarely cures you. I assumed it was a given that you were ready to accept the change. I was so ready to feel better. He just sighed, kept lecturing, asked me again and got another confused answer.

I wasn't a good person when I was drinking. It's hard for me to evaluate if that's changed, but I like to think it has. It's not really easy, or fun, trying to become better. It really isn't, at least not for me.

It has become easier over time! It has. But I think that's to do with my attitude changing. I don't do good things, productive things, to seem like a good person or to even become a good person. I do it because it's good. I shake annoyances off, not because they don't matter, but because I don't want to be annoyed. There's no point in it. I make dinner every night because I know I need to, and I eat the leftovers for lunch because it's bad to throw away food.

I think I changed, somewhere along the road. I think I became willing to accept the change that sobriety was going to create in me. I don't know when it happened, or how it happened, but I feel better for it.

Not just the changes of the sobriety itself, but the changes that happened to me. I don't have a reason to be angry every morning anymore. I have no excuse to throw a fit when I realise we're out of coffee one morning. Which means that I either change, or I stay the same person I was when I drank, minus the alcohol.

Hey everyone, hope you‚Äôre all doing okay this fine Thursday?

Today I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity to learn new things. Yesterday I booked myself in for driving lessons! I start next month. I have always lived in big cities and so driving isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd ever really needed. I want to learn so that I can enjoy greater freedom without having to rely on Uber‚Ä¶ it is a mundane dream of mine to be able to travel independently to the recycling centre, buy heavy items from the supermarket with abandon (or IKEA, which is always a pain in this arse to travel to without a car), take my cat to the vet, visit my parents‚Äô house (which is 15 mins drive and somehow 1.5hrs by public transport!). A chance to drive somewhere picturesque and take in the air. I would be saved from constantly having to get wayyy too close to people on a bus or metro. THE DREAM.

I‚Äôve downloaded a driving theory app and I‚Äôm already learning about hazard perception and road signs. This feels great! I‚Äôm excited for this adventure and I‚Äôm thankful to be in the position where I can focus on finally achieving this goal. Back before I got sober, I‚Äôd have never have had the spare money to fund lessons or to afford to run a car. I also would have probably been too drunk or hungover to drive safely. Beyond all else I hadn‚Äôt the energy to focus on learning new skills or setting goals for myself. I never thought anything was particularly worthwhile.

That‚Äôs me for today. How are we all doing? I encourage you all to share what you might be feeling thankful for today ‚Äì no matter how big or small! Sometimes it really is just the small things.

some interesting sober observations:

* i'm still clumsy.
* my energy is higher than i can remember & therefore am way more productive.
* i now get deep uninterrupted sleep at night (that took a couple of weeks).
* on that note, i realized i don't drool in my sleep anymore.
* i get kind of antsy in social situations. not because i want to drink, but i think since i'm 100% aware of everything, i get bored easier?

finally breaking free of that cycle of regretting/feeling awful about the night before then proceeding to drink to not hold myself accountable for whatever i did or said - that has been immense in this new chapter, and is helping me to learn to trust & respect myself. also just being able to remember everything & not regretting most of it (i can still be hard on myself). i can't imagine ever going back. if you're thinking about it, just try it *for today*. today only. i have known i've had a problem for years but had no idea how to get help or if i even really needed it (trying to bullshit myself). but while in the ER with 10 stitches on my face & a black lip/chin/eye (thx vodka), my sibling who is in AA convinced me to go to a meeting. i felt so hopeless & ashamed, & terrible for putting my husband through this. again. ultimately though, that support system has been essential in not drinking; one day became one week & so on. i know AA isn't for everyone, & i still struggle with some aspects (stalwart atheist here) but really, just having people around who you can relate to and are rooting for each other is so empowering. i've been reading about other recovery programs & am applying a little of everything i'm learning to pave my own like, bespoke recovery route. reading this board, going to a meeting every day & listening to other folks' stories, watching documentaries & reading books about alcoholism, as well as reflecting on my relationship with booze & its effects on my life (spoiler alert! **all** negative), have trained me to despise the thought of drinking again. i'm proud to say IWNDWYT!",19,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42710343}"

When I‚Äôm not drinking, it‚Äôs still a fight to get through the day. The only relief is sleep. But sleep doesn‚Äôt come easily, even after almost a year sober.

Rest is an escape, but when I get up in the morning, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a fresh start. It feels like the problems are still there.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thank you for all of your music suggestions in yesterday‚Äôs check in! I‚Äôm looking forward to checking them all out and compiling a new playlist! For now u/ilovebubbles51 has reminded me how much I love the Beatles! Need to add that back in my rotation. Hey Jude and Yellow Submarine are favorites of mine. u/livewiremom also reminded me about my old obsession with the Gipsy Kings! I saw them in concert back in college and used to love dancing to their music! I will definitely need more time studying all the recs! üòä 

So the early check in post yesterday was really good for me. I got a solid 8.5 hours of sleep and only woke up because my cat was crying loudly as if in pain‚Ä¶ I slept in an hour past her normal feeling time üòÜ 

It was still dark outside when we got up and there was a full moon. It was so bright my daughter was convinced someone left a light on outside. We went outside to look at the moon and were even able to see some stars (usually the light pollution in our city doesn‚Äôt allow for any star gazing). She was so excited she insisted that we eat breakfast outside by the light of the moon so we rushed inside to get some food together and for me to pour my coffee. We enjoyed 20 minutes under the moon in the dark eating and sipping on coffee. It was so nice and peaceful. 

This moment made me recall a lot of not so pleasant memories of times with my kids when I was still drinking‚Ä¶

-rushing through reading a book at bedtime and thinking about getting them to bed as fast as possible so I could enjoy wine solo
-hungover in the morning and snapping at the kids to not talk so loud
-drinking wine in a yeti mug during the day (disguised as coffee or tea) and letting the kids play video games as long as they wanted so I could zone out

Those were common occurrences but now it looks more like this‚Ä¶

-getting into a really good story with my kids and staying up late drawing or doing each other‚Äôs hair because after they go to sleep I usually do too
-awake and engaging over breakfast 
-exploring our city, going on hikes, swimming, playing a board game, cooking together, having friends over

I am crawling in my own skin. My anxiety is horrific tonight. I have been crying on and off all day. My heart rate was so high today my fitbit told me I did an hour of exercise. I was just pacing.

I thought I was going to lose my best friend, the one who saw me through celebrations and sorrow and scary situations. My wingman.

Alcohol numbed me to everything. While I was trying to numb my pain, I numbed any possible joy as well. I numbed the disappointment I felt from my family. I didn't care that I was lost in stasis. The only emotion I really had left was fear. I was so afraid all the time, of these dark looming shadows that I refused to face.

When I was finally able to see the light through the forest and came to the understanding that alcohol was not my best friend, but my worst enemy, I wasn't afraid of being uncool or unfunny anymore. In that moment, I was afraid of living the rest of my life in this miserable state I had put myself in. I was afraid of anyone finding out how I lived. I was afraid of never being able to love anyone as much as I loved alcohol. I was afraid I was going to die before my next birthday, with my body found weeks later because I was so isolated. I finally accepted the fears and emotions I was running away from and fully embraced them. The best and worst part about it is that none of it was nearly as scary as their shadows on the wall were. Especially when I came at them with a clear mind.

Before sobriety, I was frozen in terror every day for years. Today, I got endless compliments, a promotion and a pay raise from a job I started last month, working a job I never imagined I could be responsible enough to hold. Sobriety has done nothing but good for every aspect of my life. I wish more than anything that every single one of you is able to find the reason to choose sobriety. I will never regret sobriety a day in my life, I know that in my heart.

Sorry if I'm spoiling it for those who haven't read it, but hey, you've had like 150 years to catch up, so...
In the start, Dr. Jekyll's chemical discovery is more fascinating than dangerous. It confers strength, youth and vigor; it makes you powerful. Unfortunately, it also brings out all of Dr. Jekyll's very worst qualities, but it's okay because he can control it and keep the consequences minor. It's worth it for the rush of power and freedom it gives him. But eventually it starts to slip out of his grasp. That alter ego develops a mind of its own and the consequences start to get more serious. A little girl gets attacked and it takes a lot of money and pull to keep it under wraps. Still, he doesn't want to stop; he needs it. Soon he's had to create a whole second life to keep his habit going. He knows it's dangerous, harmful, destructive, he knows he's losing control, but it's become an addiction he can't relinquish. People are starting to talk; his second life is starting to spill over into his normal one, and his life is beginning to significantly suffer as a result. But he's still determined to manage it because that other self is now as much a part of his soul as the original. He needs Hyde. Finally the breaking point comes- his other self completely loses control and murders a well loved and prominent member of society. He's almost relieved at first: horrible as it is, it's finally enough to persuade him to quit his transformation permanently. He's so ready to give it up. ...except, to his horror, he's discovered he can't. It's gone too far, and now Hyde can take control whether he wants him to or not. It's not even about taking the chemical anymore, it's BECOME him. And it starts to take over more and more frequently, forcing him into total isolation, driving away every joy and replacing it with terror of a self he no longer recognizes. And in the end, it kills him. Reading through it again, I can feel so powerfully the horror and desperation conveyed in Jekyll's final letter, when he realizes the thing is completely out of his control now no matter what he does and will eventually overtake him totally. I don't want that fate. I don't want the horror and degradation of losing all control of my life because I just had to have that one more drink. It scares me every day, badly, as i know I've already crossed the line into full-blown alcoholism and that one next slip could take me down the road to absolute ruin. Easily. I hate it, and I don't want to forget how much I hate it in the temporary lure of instant relief. An excellent read if you want a good reminder of what it's like.

I try to control my breathing when this happens, which can help, but I still cannot return to a calm enough state to go back to sleep for like half an hour to an hour (or more!).  

I am 100% sure this anxiety is the result of my quitting drinking.  Obviously the drinking masked some underlying problems, but I never had any anxiety at all in my life and certainly nothing like this.  Before I drank/became a full fledged alkie, I used to do like months long hiking/camping trips and never even considered having anxiety from sleeping in a goddamn tent.  It is frankly embarrassing and the more it fucks with my life, the less sobriety appeals to me, though not to the point where I‚Äôd drink (but I‚Äôd like for it not to get to that point).

I never drank in high school, and was pressured into drinking in college while joining a fraternity. Since then, I've had a love/hate relationship with alcohol.

The issue is, no matter how hard I try to change my perceptions, I end up finding ways to tell myself I don't need to quit drinking. I've read This Naked Mind many times, listened to the podcast, posted/read this subreddit, and taken multiple long breaks from drinking. The messages in society though tell me I'm missing out or not a normal participant if I'm not drinking. 

Also, the thought of quitting again makes me feel like I'm losing things that I love. For instance, there's a very cozy bar where I've enjoyed getting old fashioneds during the winter for years. I don't want to lose that. I've tried asking myself, ""was it really the old fashioned that made it great?"" My mind is still convinced that it actually was an important part of the experience. Another example is that my mom loves to get Christmas cocktails with me. It's a tradition that has existed in our family for generations. 

I can moderate drinking for awhile, but then I'll have a few more one night and it can turn into an all-nighter binge where I also chain smoke way too many cigarettes. That sometimes leads to one or two more nights where I do the same, and then I'll feel so sick and crappy that I'll decide I'm not drinking anymore. Yes, I've also recorded myself explaining how crappy I feel and that hasn't helped either.

Typically, I will not drink during the week. On the weekends though, I can put back anywhere from 12-18 beers each night (Friday/Saturday). Sometimes might do another night on Sunday if I feel like risking feeling crappy for work on Monday. I only smoke when I drink too. Most nights start with me going out and having a few drinks with friends, then I'll go home, continue drinking, sit outside, listen to music, and chain smoke for hours.

My problem with alcohol is specifically the ""no stop button"" issue when it comes to drinking beer. I didn't drink any other kind of alcohol (it's all still here in the house, untouched). I don't have an issue *not* drinking, I have a problem with ""one is never enough"".

Last year I started reducing my consumption and monitoring the effects and challenges. I was pretty cyclical in going 11-12 days of not drinking, followed by days of drinking, rinse/repeat. During this time, it became clear to me that I needed to dedicate a longer period of time to sobriety to gauge the true effects it was having, so I set out on a 100 day target.

Enough rambling. My single piece of advice that has **really** helped keep me on this 100 day goal is to keep a daily journal. Even if it's only a couple of sentences a day, it's something that's helped keep the goal in the forefront of the brain as well as provided a level of accountability to myself.

""If you stop drinking today, by New Year you will have 100 sober days.""

I read those words 4 years ago on this sub when I was at the lowest I'd ever been. I'd just attempted suicide for the third time of 2017, and was a broken fragment of a person. My neck had grazes, it hurt to move my head in most directions and one of my eyes had done that thing where blood pools all around the sclera. My hand was swollen and bruised from repeatedly smacking the wooden doorframe in a rage after the belt had broken. My throat was sore and my face swollen from yelling and crying. I wouldn't wish that feeling of emptiness, loneliness, pain and abject despair on my worst enemy. Booze was far from my only problem, but it was making my real problems unmanageable.

I had absolutely no idea what on earth I was going to do to fix where I was at. And now it even seemed like killing myself wasn't an option. (Two things they don't tell you about suicide; 1. It's actually quite difficult and 2. A failed attempt is, in itself, traumatic. I didn't have the energy to make another attempt only to potentially fail again).

Something registered. 100 days seemed like a lot, but New Year didn't feel that far away. Something I'd previously thought entirely impossible for some reason now had an aura of vague possibility. (To be real though, if you were to zip back in time and tell me that I'd actually *succeed* in racking up the 100 days, I probably wouldn't have believed it, let alone if you'd told me that I was actually on day 1 of 4 **years** of sobriety).

So, for anyone who needs to read it; IF YOU STOP DRINKING TODAY, BY NEW YEAR YOU'LL HAVE 100 SOBER DAYS! It may feel impossible. It might seem like it is beyond your reach, but it is not. You are far stronger than you can imagine, and you absolutely deserve your freedom from alcohol. You deserve peace.

Thank you to r/stopdrinking. It's probably not an exaggeration to say that without this sub, I wouldn't now be alive. I'm not 'all better' by any means, but I am getting there.

I wasn't prepared for the vivitrol to work as well as it did. I've had two doses total now. I don't know how it's working from an abstinence view, not TSM. All I know is that my intrusive thoughts are minimal... Hardly a craving and never an urge.

I have maintained my 600mg/3x daily dose of gabapentin. My anxiety didn't lessen, it all but went away. An upshoot to the mental functioning on gaba I realized quite soon that I was enjoying the medicine in a potentially abusive manner. I'd equate the ""high"" it gave me similar to a light and warm opiate buzz. I could see this being a massive problem for quite a few.

But one of the things that is standard at every Jewish holiday is saying the blessing over wine. I haven't been to a holiday celebration in a long while because of Covid, so I had sort of forgotten (blocked out?) that part. And God knows that the pre-Covid me would have poured myself a FULL glass of wine (for ALLL the blessings, amiright?)

I walked into the Sukkah (the tent) and immediately saw the wine bottles on the table. Like my eyes were heat seeking missiles, just immediately locked in. While everyone was gathering, I had the predictable conversation with myself. ""It's just one glass. I've been sober for 6 months which proves that I can be sober. It's a religious thing! When in Rome."" As if these incredibly kind and intelligent people would actually want me to risk my sobriety for ""a religious thing."" It's not even my religion! Then came the moment of truth. It was time to pour the glasses for the blessing. The person next to me held up a bottle of white (my favorite!) and offered to pour my glass. I looked her dead in the eye and said....

""No thanks, I'll stick with the juice."" (There is also grape juice for the kids.) And that was that. No one demanded to know why I wasn't drinking. No one accused me of being insensitive to their religious beliefs. No one even blinked. And I drank my juice and actually it was pretty good. So, I wish you all a Chag Samaech (Happy Holiday) and have a round of juice on me.

Unlike many posters here, I was not a binge drinker. I rarely even got drunk. But I was always buzzed under this haze of booze. It would start with a vodka/water around 9:30am, then three or four more throughout the day, then switching to three or four glasses of wine at night. Work was the primary trigger for my anxiety, and working from home meant drinking constantly was far too easy. I couldn‚Äôt even get through a work meeting without taking a shot beforehand. 

I‚Äôd hide the bottles in the clothes hamper and other parts of the closet. I‚Äôm sure my partner knew what I was doing. Once a month or so, I‚Äôd fill bags of vodka bottles and drive until I could find a dumpster to throw them into. 

I always knew I‚Äôd have to quit one day, but it felt like such a monumental task. Alcohol was my crutch ‚Äî for everything. Then one day I Googled ‚Äúaffirmations to quit drinking‚Äù and found this sub. The ‚Äúone day at a time‚Äù approach is what worked for me. I only had to worry about not drinking today. That was it.

Fast-forward 50 days, and the journey has been a rollercoaster, but I finally feel like I might have a shot at being happy. Sunday nights are still hard as I feel the work week coming on. But overall, I‚Äôm sleeping much better, I‚Äôve shed a couple pounds, my stools are healthier and have no more 3am panic attacks.

Work stress is still there, but I cope differently, and this week I‚Äôm meeting with an adoption agency to look into adopting a child.

Life is a crazy ride, and even more so when you‚Äôre an alcoholic. But maybe we can all appreciate the ‚Äúbrightness‚Äù a little more than the average person because we‚Äôve experienced our share of the ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù.

Thank you to this sub for helping save my life. To those thinking that quitting is an impossible task, just focus on not drinking today. Don‚Äôt worry about living sober forever. Just today.

Obviously I haven't drank in quite a while and this my friend I meet with is very supportive of this fact and never pushy, and I'm happy to sit and shoot the breeze with him while he's drinking and he's happy that I'm just having something alcohol free. Even though I didn't drank anything outside of alcohol free beer or tap water yesterday, my mind tricked myself into thinking that I had a drink, was drunk and am now hungover. What happened was when we met in the first pub that we always meet in, my friend got me an alcohol free version of the pubs most popular craft beer. About halfway through drinking it, I started to feel a bit dizzy and light header. Bare in mind it was an exceptionally hot day for London in September and it was the first time that I had sat down and relaxed since 6 that morning as I was up with my baby, feeding him, getting him ready for nursery, bringing him to nursery, walking the dogs, doing a bit of housework and then rushing to get the train to London. As the day went on then I couldn't help but thinking that I was given the alcohol version of craft beer and that I was feeling that way because I was drunk. It actually ruined my day as I felt guilty, I got a headache and I ended up heading a lot earlier than I had planned. And then this morning I feel slightly anxious, a bit hot in the face and tired.

However, here is the thing: I did not drink, I know for a fact I had the alcohol free version. The reasons I know this are:

1. The alcohol version of it is 5.4%. If I had this, I would have known from the very first sip and would have felt a lot 'drunker' than I was

2. If it was alcohol, I wouldn't have left a drop in the glass. Because I find alcohol free craft beer can be a bit sharp, I tend not to finish a full pint so I left about a third of the glass behind. If I was drinking, I would have had every last drop

3. I wouldn't have had such a nice evening last night when I got back if I had been drinking. I spent some nice time with my wife and son, took the dogs out and got a nice deep sleep.

So my advice to you would be to not believe what your alcoholic brain is trying to tell you, as difficult as that may be. And also, if you do have a drink by mistake, it doesn't ruin your streak and as long as you stop after that and don't have any more, we're all human and make mistakes.

I have been lurking for a while, but recently, within the last week have been posting. Quick background...I have had a horrible relationship with Vodka over the past 2.5 years. I would often go through a 1.75 Liter bottle within 4-5 days on top of a few hard seltzers. Sunday, I decided to pour the rest of the Vodka out, went out to get beer and white claw to try to taper. Sunday night I had 12. 12 is still an awful lot, but the beer was 4.2% alcohol and was alternating between that and White Claw. Monday night, it was more of the same. I was having a hard time reducing that night. Last night, I switched to Corona Hard Seltzer (4.5%) and alternated beer, but I was able to manage to reduce to 6 and went to bed at 8:00 pm. 

I am off of work this week and spent the entire day yesterday searching this sub and watching YouTube vids on quitting drinking. I decided that I find it SO HARD to taper, that I am just going to rip the bandaid off and stop. My husband feels that I should try to just drop to 3 tonight, but it is so hard! I used to be so scared of withdrawals, but at this point, I am tired of dragging this out. I have Xanax (prescribed) and intend on using this today. At least he is here in case I run into problems. He is going to stop drinking as well. 

I am so grateful for everyone on this sub and the support they offer everyone! Please wish me luck.

I have been drinking everyday for the last 5-6 years now, previous to that I was a weekend binge drinker. Started slow with a few beers everyday after work (like mum and dad) and gradually over time the drinks increased to maybe 8-12 drinks per day (averaging a 4pm start). Right now Im drinking about 6-8 drinks per day. However over the last month my anxiety has started getting crazy. A few personal issues have started causing panic attacks (which are over now) however I still have terrible anxiety during the day worried about anything and everything that comes up. 

After realising it was not the events causing the anxiety however the booze I now have decided to start tapering off (for physical health reasons also of course although I dont have any issues at this point in time). 

So just looking for advice and support. I done a good bit of research and will be sticking with beer and wine and measuring out the drinks so I know how many I consume and starting to cut it down gradually. I would really appreciate anything you guys have to say especially how to try to deal with the anxiety. 

Much love!

- stress, in particular with work, is still there but I feel myself much more in control of how I manage it.
- winding down at the end of the night is still my favorite part of the day. But when I was drinking I'd be numb past 10 and pass out drunk. Naturally falling asleep to a show in background is the best. 
- I needed a support group and finally made some leaps in the AA community. This thread is great and I read it every night, but being able to connect with people in person is a necessity for me.
- don't diagnose symptoms on Google
- it gets easier. I remember being on vacation in my 1st month and I needed to get an odouls with dinner as I was jonesin. Now I often have nights of not thinking about it.
- what keeps me sober is remembering the withdrawals. I'm 33M and am lucky to not have had a DUI, jail time, court, divorce, detox. However I home detoxed at least 20-30 times and each time was hell. I don't ever want those symptoms again. 72 hours of anxiety and no sleep is too much. 
- I do often miss it. While my triggers are isolation, boredom and stress, I was more 'sad' I couldn't drink at a bachelor party last weekend. There are definitely some nights I want to drink like 1000 beers.
- your family and true friends don't care or will judge you. In fact, some may admire it.
- there's still some things I'm trying to grasp like the higher power element and keeping it to 24 hours but I'm staying open minded. Both still scare me.
- I think I've actually gained weight. More cereal, pizza, ice cream sandwiches. I'm working on it!
- I'm a more optimistic/happy person. For a few years I was stuck in a vicious cycle of drinking to try and forget my sadness. I'd blame the job, girlfriend, daughter stress, as an excuse to drink which always brought me back to square 1 with daily depression.
- I have a long way to go, but for anyone just starting out, just stay open minded. I'm a born skeptic, but support through this sub and AA have kept me sober for 3 months!

He's always been so mad and mean about my relapses so I feel like I'm walking on egg shells around him.... And that's a trigger. 
This relapse he's been supportive and I feel like I can talk to him. 
Tonight everything was fine, than he drank ( he still does) and out comes this other side of him that is telling me he can barely stand to have me around but I'm the next sentence he tells me he will be supportive. Then off he goes again telling me how hard this has been on him..

Now I don't blame him for feeling that way, alcoholics tend to drive their families away.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Thoughts are running around in my head... should it be a vodka with just a splash of soda? Or, no, it should be a glass of wine... it's ""just"" wine.  It wouldn't *really* be drinking. Or, I could have either of them but it would just be one.... one vodka or just a ""shallow"" glass of wine and I'll close up the bottle right away.  Truth is, I've never NOT finished a bottle of wine (wtf is left over wine!?!) or made *one* *drink*.  Even my one drink counts as at least two with the amount of vodka I pour.  So while the romance of alcohol swirls stories in my head, I know, underneath those fairy thoughts, the real truth.  If I start, I will be drunk. The fresh moments of a new buzz will feel good... for a fleeting 20 minutes. To chase it, I'll justify in my mind that I should have another... and another.  Soon, I won't even have to justify.  I'll just pour.... and pour, until I make my way to bed.  Maybe I'll even spice it up and take a pill, convincing myself that I need it because my head will hurt.  Of course, the fact that it floats the buzz doesn't hurt either.  Once in bed, I'll pass out without any opportunity to reflect on the day or appreciate the beautiful parts of my life.  I'll drop to the ""nowhere land"" of my brain.  But then, come 3 am, my body will revolt and I'll awake with remorse, fear, guilt, and shame.  Cruel words to beat myself up.  I likely will not recall the end of the night.  What happened?  Did I say something or do something wrong? More pills to try and sleep. Then, morning.  The anxiety propels me out of bed... moving quickly shields my feelings.  If I move fast enough I won't feel it, dodging the crushing blow that I did it again.  But I know.  I know in the depths of my hangover that I never intended to just have one and that no matter how much I tried to convince myself it would be okay to drink ... that it wouldn't be *like that* this time ... I was only lying to myself.  Even writing this out... playing out that awful path in my head, my body still wants the drink. But I won't have it.  I lead my mind to the other side of the story.  The story of not drinking.

Back when I drank, I used to have a glass of whiskey or bourbon every night after I put the kid to bed to wind down the night. I'm pretty old school - Jameson or Old Overholt or Kirkland whiskey on the rocks.

It was my official separation between the work day and the taking-care-of-the-kid time and having a night where I finally got an hour or two of free time to do whatever.

It was great except half the time I'd chase the whiskey with a six pack or with three more whiskeys and that didn't work well.

Anyway, I miss having that night ritual. I'm trying other beverages but I hate kombucha, I hate herbal tea... I like non-alcoholic beer but there's no satisfaction in drinking it. Nothing special about it. I was never a weed person, so smoking up doesn't help either. 

I just want something relaxing. My day kicks my ass and I don't want to do any exercise after work, I just want something for chill time.

I lost a pretty important friendship a while back... And I'm so angry and upset about it still. Essentially, she started doing meth. There wasn't anything I can do for her... I tried. I tried a lot. But the trust is damaged. And she wouldn't let me help her. Now she seems to be doing better. I'm happy about that. But that doesn't change that I'm angry and hurt and upset about what it did to our friendship.

I have always been her safety net. That person that solves problems... Whether it be just finding out information, knowing who to talk to, or just being a supportive person while she figured out what she needed. Generally, these were the adult-type problems that people have growing up. Legal, financial, usually just paperwork of some form or fashion. Mundane things, really. She's never had any positive, responsible adults in her life. We're both adults now. 

I got to the point... Where I was essentially enabling her not to fully do what was necessary to get better. I felt as if I was enabling her. And also to protect my own mental health and well-being... I had to step away from it. The entire situation. It made it easier since she didn't live where I live anymore.

I found out today that she's back. She's asking for housing assistance where I work. Which is great! I was trying to get her to do that last year. But it hit me like a ton of bricks today when I saw her name for document pickup. It pretty much upset me most of the day. And I'm not quite sure why.

I think it is mostly because if she's here I can't compartmentalize it. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to forgive her right this moment. I don't want to be friends necessarily yet. I don't want to do anything with it. I want it all to just go away. But if she's in town again... Then there's a good chance we're going to run into each other. It's not a very large town. 


Anyway... This is turning into a novel. 

My point: I feel like drinking right now. I'm not going to. And I'm trying to find other things that might fix that feeling that you get when you just need that drink. Or think you need that drink. I'm probably going to go buy a diet Coke... Maybe some keto ice cream. Maybe some chips and Mexican cheese dip... I don't know. I'm going to give myself anything I want right now...

Saturday I woke up with a sore throat, fever and really bad body aches and chills, so I didn't drink. Was terrified I had weakened my immune system so much I had caught Covid despite being vaccinated. By Saturday evening, everything had become worse and there was a lump in my throat that was making it painful to swallow, so it was most likely strep throat.   


By Sunday I could barely drink water or even eat soup without feeling like I was being stabbed in the throat, EVERY single time that I swallowed. I was practically delerious so my best friend took me to urgent care to get antibiotics but they couldn't see me without a covid test, and there was no place to get tested that day. Didn't drink.  


Monday I went to get a covid test (negative thankfully) and the nurse nearly forced me to go to the ER because of my heart rate, which was likely elevated because of the constant pain from the abscess in my throat and withdrawal/dehydration. Tested positive for Strep and got antibiotics and forced myself to drink as much water as I could despite the pain. Monday night was possibly the worst night of my life. Couldn't sleep for more than an hour at a time and every time I woke up with my bed soaked in sweat. Didn't drink.  


Today is Day 4 and IWNDWYT. I picked the WORST time to sober up as the symptoms from withdrawal and strep compounded upon each other. But I did sober up, so it might have actually been the BEST because it was the kick in the pants I needed to make a change. After days of not being able to eat or drink water without extreme pain, drinking alcohol seems like the dumbest thing to me. I am going to make better choices about what I put in my body.",7,"{'immun': 1, 'covid': 3}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.84853107}"

-And one of my favorites, I get to be an example of sobriety and what it can do for us.

THE LAST PROMISE
We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 84

The last Promise in the Big Book came true for me on the very first day of sobriety. God kept me sober that day, and on every other day I allowed Him to operate in my life. He gives me the strength, courage and guidance to meet my responsibilities in life so that I am then able to reach out and help others stay sober and grow. He manifests within me, making me a channel of His word, thought and deed. He works with my inner self, while I produce in the outer world, for He will not do for me what I can do for myself. I must be willing to do His work, so that He can function through me successfully.

For me personally, when I realized that this was possible with the help of my higher power, the obsession of alcohol in my mind had minimized. It was crazy to think that I was relearning how to live life without alcohol. I was able to deal with my problems with healthy coping mechanisms using all the tools I‚Äôve learned in AA. This program has truly saved my life. I‚Äôm 26, and I am excited to live a sober life and be a sober mom to my baby. Putting my faith in my higher power was hard at first, but with practice I‚Äôve been able to do so and it‚Äôs led me to happy and joyous days!

I definitely didn't want to quit forever, but I had an idea that I'd learn a lot from a three week break followed by a return to drinking.

So, I've learned that the ""day 1"" after a three week break is hellish. I forced myself out of bed this morning, forced myself to eat breakfast and get some work done. I think that I might have crossed a line with alcohol and the anxiety it now causes me is unbearable. I need to carefully replace alcohol-fueled activities with other activities. I also probably need to get therapy.

During the three AF weeks, I basically worked all the time. I need to figure out how to relax, and how to be ""okay"" with down-time, without using alcohol. I doubt I'm the only person here who has found this to be a problem. Any advice would be appreciated! At the start of the break, a few people suggested a hobby like knitting that would be relaxing yet give me the feeling of doing something. That didn't really work, though.

Stopped drinking May 3rd, 2021 after reading Allen Carr‚Äôs Quit Drinking the Easy Way after 15 years of heavy drinking. 

In my teens and early twenties I overdid it constantly: blacked out, got into dangerous situations, pissed myself several times, started getting into harder substances, had attempted interventions by friends. 

Then got into a LTR that helped me time it down, but still I‚Äôd overdo it several times a year, generally embarrassing myself. 

In the last several years, I drank a glass or three of wine most nights, more on weekends, with that occasional too much, act stupid, be full of regret etc. (a few times a year at least) 

The pandemic amped up my daily drinking a bit and one big blowout fight plus drinking two bottles of wine alone crying and that was enough for me. 

So I went about three months zero alcohol. It wasn‚Äôt a magic formula but I felt good about it and am also going through some of the hardest personal stuff I‚Äôve ever gone through, family estrangement due to emotional/ physical abuse, gaslighting, narcissism etc. so I feel like the real benefits haven‚Äôt even had a chance, though I‚Äôve lost 7 lbs, my skin cleared up, I‚Äôm a little richer/ happier. 

A couple months in I decide to try one single drink with a close friend over dinner. I don‚Äôt really enjoy it, but whatever. Cool, I think. I can handle one socially nbd. 

I start dating again and have a single drink on a second date. Ok, I‚Äôve got this. Drink two on the next date, one on the next. I start looking forward to that one drink a week. 

I moved into a new place and it was super stressful and I wanted to celebrate. I was gifted a bottle of sparkling wine I‚Äôd been holding onto for weeks and opened it. I have champagne stoppers but justified drinking the whole bottle because it would go flat üôÑ

Felt annoyed w myself hungover in my new place, but back on the wagon. 

A couple weeks later had five cocktails over 5 hours on a very special dinner (a place where they kind of push free fancy drinks on you) 

Had a single drink at a work party the next day. 

I‚Äôve found myself buying ‚Äúportion control‚Äù booze, like a can of wine which is 2 servings. I still feel slightly hungover the next day, even after a single beer. 

I know I‚Äôm maybe not as hardcore as some ppl here, though see above I‚Äôve been messy too, so I was hesitant to post, but I just wanted to share what‚Äôs been going on. 

I don‚Äôt really enjoy drinking (the price, even for 2 drinks, is not worth the high IMHO) but part of me also just wants to be normal and have a drink on a special occasion (which I have shown I can do one or two and leave it) 

Anyways, I‚Äôm recommitting to sobriety today. I know moderation isn‚Äôt really discussed here, but it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been on my mind a lot and I‚Äôm not quite severe, but also have a history of getting blackout drunk and losing control. 

I still am having a hard time of letting go of the idea of being ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and having a couple on a special occasion. Am I just romanticizing booze? 

I know that I‚Äôm doing infinitely better than before, at 4-5 bottles of wine a week, I‚Äôm just struggling and feeling uncertain. 

I hope this isn‚Äôt triggering or the wrong place to post. 

TLDR; quit drinking four months ago after 15 years of heavy drinking. Have been playing with fire‚Äî moderation recently. I‚Äôm disappointed I can still down five drinks no prob, and disappointed in myself if I even have one or two alone. I don‚Äôt always want more, but sometimes I do. I‚Äôm recommitting to sobriety (had one pumpkin beer last night, it fucked w my sleep) but having trouble letting go of romanticizing alcohol.

I miss my old life.

My old friends.

The hollow feeling of being somewhere and doing things. While drinking to numb the fact that i was not moving anywhere in life.

When drinking I could not think about my messed up life and just went around pretending i was fine.  Im not fine.

Yes I feel happier, im just frustrated that I now have to deal with everything and drinking is not an option.

My family is weird af mother hates my drinking, but she'd hate seeing me in AA more, so- as with my drinking- I keep it a secret.  

And in AA I remember the mess I was, but people over there were all in rehab or in way worse situations than my own. But hell i know i got tired of drinking and doing ""soft drugs"".

I wasted 13 years of my life, Im 28 living with my parents, all my friends are high achievers, my best friend from high school drifted apart from me, I cant blame him i was a bad drunk. He's building houses, so many houses, got married, my other friend got on the family business and although he is an alcoholic is on the same big money ride that we all talked about when young. I got an office job, hated my parents for making me a lawyer and refuse to work in the family firm, because I'm stupid, now im 28 and see the treasure I wasted, and the trauma that made me hate everything, specially myself, it's so easy to hide the belief that you dont deserve to be happy when you are drinking, getting high and keeping yourself busy as not to feel your own feelings.

I feel such grief for oppotunities lost. I can now see how hurt i was and how my drinking was a reflection of that. How hurt my family has been not only by my drinking but by the drama and hurt that provoked my disease.  And my parents are just getting older and im stuck at a desk job I kind of hate  and remembering every other day how I wanted to be a nature photographer when I was a kid and how I have failed my self so bad...

jeez that's my crazy self talking. Cant recommend how important it is to just write your downward spiral in a piece of paper, read it through and realize that the disease is not your self.  

If I belief this rant as my reality the only logical consequence would be to drink myself to dead. I'm not willing to go down that path.

Well I got a camera and I started a theather company, had a succesful play and met a girl that cares a lot about me, im scared shitless half the time but at least im sober and life seems to be getting fine.

Honestly the deskjob is not as bad and I was ready to work as a free-lawyer but I could use the job's steady income for a couple more months to pay some bills and fix some stuff. Probably should not be at reddit during work but I delivered my quota and it's lunchtime.Also I needed to vent, I had wanted to write an hones 100 days post.

Life on life's terms is never easy but when not drinking you are aware 
of it.

Im 29 and its another day 1 for me. Ive been regularly binge drinking since I was like 16. Father is a alcky too and that enabled me to start drinking very early in my life since I lost my mother. There was always something in the house to drink. Ive never been a maintenance drinker. When I drink I drink to get totally drunk. There is no in between for me. Im eather sober or completely drunk. I dont drink every day but I do drink my self to oblivion 1-4 times per week. 

Anyway, since covid started I have been getting quite out of hand. First time in my life im getting withdrawals after every time I drink. I dont think im at seizure territory yet or need medical attention but I think Im on my way there If I keep it up.

My tolerance is through the roof. Yesterday I drank 12 pints of beer by my self and today I had to call in sick for the first time because of my drinking, I feel so sick. Its probably not just hangover. Im withdrawing. I also threw up a bit of blood and It freaked me out.

I cant moderate at all. One drink and Im gone for the day. Even if I start drinking with the intent of only having 1-2 drinks I end up just drinking all day. This has to stop.

Ive known for a quite some time that I have a problem with drinking. Ive had many attempts on sobriety with the longest being something like 3 months. Ive always started again and ended up right where I left after quitting. I must not forget that I cant moderate but I do. I forget it really quick.

I cant have any of it unless I dont wanna end up drunk. Really early in my sobriety streaks Im usually positive and remember that I cant have any. But only a few more days in my alcoholic brain starts to convince me, that this is the time where I can finally moderate. I fail every time.

How do I not give in to these thought patterns, how do I distract my self from them? This time I wanna do it properly.

  Like many of you, I have struggled with my relationship with alcohol from the second the first drops of smirnoff touched my lips. An insecure teenager giving into the allure of underage drinking, inevitably resulting in a vomit crazen blackout followed by my first ""rough"" morning. 

  This first house party marked the advent of my marriage to alcohol. A relationship which from the beginning has been destructive and dangerous bringing with it the baggage train of anxiety, depression and shame. 

  This isnt to say I havent had some amazing experiences with alcohol. Those rare occasions where I ate well before, drank just the right amount and was more or less in the zone throughout the bingeing. Nonetheless, the key word here is ""rare"", which is exactely what the occasions were. 

  More often than not, each night of drinking usually came with some degree of regret. As like many of you in this community, my form of alcohol use disorder is the inability to stop once I've started. 

  Over the years ive tried to convince myself never again, i'll be able to moderate next time. Going so far as to set a timer between drinks or sticking with only one form of liquor instead of mixing. And even though I had some limited success, the brutal reality is that one night comes where I reach the point of no return, and blackout.

  These blackouts have been truly devastating in my life. Ive done and said some really terrible things, totally out of character. Ive never subscribed to ""alcohol brings out the truth"", I believe it cages your true self instead, our inhibitions exist for a reason.

   Without getting into too much detail, over the past three years ive had some really close calls because of overdrinking where I could have easily ruined my life or even been killed. The crippling shame and anxiety that follows these events, and the stress it has put on my relationships, both personal and professional, is at a breaking point. 

  I should have quit months, if not years ago, but ive never been able to truly envision my life completely without the drink. I am terrified of the social implications but simultaneously excited and optimistic about a future without making a fool of myself, ruining my reputation, or having my luck finally run out.

  I do believe this is my time. One day at a time. To really grow as a person. Ive been a problem drinker since I was 18, im 30 now, and its time to finally put an actual effort into realizing my potential. Something alcohol has never allowed me to do. 

  Ill be using this reddit community as a reminder. And also im looking into professional counseling to stay the course. Really going to give this a proper go.

Overall it has been a somewhat mediocre experience. I am in grad school, and the pressure is on to find a job for post grad next year, while at the same time keeping up with advanced level classes. I am really hoping something changes for me soon and things get a little easier, because this level of stress isn't sustainable. I spent most evenings over the past few years getting drunk and even on the most stressful days, I knew I at least had something to look forward to when I made it home and could decompress. I don't have that anymore, which is fine, but the problem is I don't have anything else either. Everyday is stress and pressure, and at this point, the most I have to look forward to at the end of the day is finally going to sleep. There has to be more to a sober life than this, and assuming there is, I would like to know how to discover it.

While I understand that I should feel proud for making it two weeks, I don't feel much at all except for resentment about the bad habits I formed and having to correct them during a time in my life where I should be focused on my education and future.",13,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5055516}"

Wrong. 

Turned into a weekend bender that resulted in buying another huge bottle of wine, which I had to finish yesterday so I don‚Äôt have any alcohol left in my apartment anymore and won‚Äôt be tempted, right?

Wrong.

2021-09-21 11:01:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pskj5x/i_made_a_terrible_mistake_at_a_bachelor_party/,I made a terrible mistake at a bachelor party,"....By not realizing how much fun I'd have sober! Seriously, the weekend in the woods with a bunch of hard-drinking dudes turned out to be nothing to fear at all. It was instead *fun.* So, on this sometimes rocky journey of self-discovery I figured I'd share a few insights from several days of isolation with nothing but nature, stereotypically masculine activities, and what I thought would be heavy drinkers to keep my sober self company.

&#x200B;

* People drink a lot less than you'd expect. Sure, the bachelor and a couple others got into it pretty good, but for the most part everyone would have 3-4 drinks over the course of the day and call it. One guy never exceeded 2 drinks per day the entire long weekend ‚Äî social drinkers are totally a thing.
* Sobriety is a super power. Granted I've known this for a hot minute, but it really shined over the weekend. Designated driver to the cocktail bar? Check. Early morning coffee run while people sleep in? I gotchu. Cooking on a hot grill in the mid-day sun? Done. And I enjoyed helping out! It gave purpose and allowed others to relax and indulge responsibly. 
* Everyone was really respectful of me abstaining. The amateur bartender offered to make me mocktails, people supplied me with a never-ending stream of soda water, and one dude had a serious interest in NA brews. People really aren't as judgmental or pushy as you sometimes fear.
* After my not drinking was more organically out in the open, one guest did sidebar me privately at saying they'd considered quitting drinking themselves and could see it in their future. They very respectfully asked me questions about my own sobriety, and I provided what insight I could about my own situation. Looking back, sober people with their crap together were a pretty big inspiration along my own sober curious journey, so I hope that if anything I could have a similar impact.
* NA brews: mixed opinions on this forum and elsewhere, but they worked for me. Your mileage may vary but no regrets from me on this one. 
* Life is fun sober. Seriously, I felt more confident, more alert, more ""on,"" and even more funny than I could imagine being in a big group while sober. And the events I would have dreaded in the past because of a hangover, like the early morning target shooting? Not only were they enjoyable, but I performed *well* (did I somehow win a group target contest? Yes, yes I did). 
* Fear of the unexpected is in part what delayed me from becoming sober in the first place. Learning to embrace the unknown and uncontrollable is instead next level growth.

Anyway, this has been a lot of bubbles to say this: there are hard days and events you dread, but you *can* do it. And it may even be more fun than you expected. It's a journey for all of us, and while no long trip is ever easy, it will inevitably offer many surprises ‚Äî good and bad, but so far it's had more of the former than the latter.

My TV still isn't set up (nor do I even own a couch yet for that matter) but I have now put Netflix on my Kindle Fire and started watching a few Prime and Netflix shows at night in bed. I started the new Netflix show *The Chair*, which romanticizes a lot of annoying, consequence free heavy drinking. I also have a lot of nitpicky issues with it as an English major, like one professor offering up a bit of Melville trivia to a renown Melville scholar at the photocopier as if he wouldn't already know it, but I am kind of enjoying it. Especially as something way lighter than *The Ambassadors*.

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Tuesday everyone! I hope everyone‚Äôs week is off to a good start. 

This is my second time to quit drinking. I originally quit over 3 years ago, using this sub as my initial way to stop (another account that I stopped using sometime last year). My first time quitting I was very stressed with 50% wrk travel and new home construction costs and issues. I was drinking to deal with the stress. When I quit then I went cold turkey and jumped into sober living and was very dedicated. 

I was sober through all the early COVID shutdowns. Then, in January this year I decided I wanted to drink again‚Ä¶ I had forgotten how bad it was. before. I had all kinds of rules setup. I decided that I would only drink on the weekends and earlier in the afternoon so it wouldn‚Äôt mess with my sleep and not every weekend. Anyways, it was fine at first and I wasn‚Äôt even drinking a lot but then I found myself thinking about it all the time. Letting my kids play video games all weekend so I could ignore them and drink wine and read (although I never really got any good reading done). I quit again in May and it was easier than the first time but also very hard. 

u/FeeBeeMac mentioned ‚ÄúFading Affect Bias‚Äù in yesterday‚Äôs check in and that‚Äôs absolutely what happened to me. After about 2 years sober I stopped checking in and didn‚Äôt think I had a problem. I also started eating junky and gave up exercising during COVID shutdowns and was mildly depressed as a result. 

When I decided to quit again I re-listened to the books This Naked Mind and Alcohol Explained that had originally helped me quit. Those really helped reset my thinking again. I had forgotten a lot of the important points from those books. I also recently discovered a podcast called the Huberman Lab that someone recommended here and I‚Äôm really enjoying the discussions he has around dopamine and addiction. Next on my list is to purchase the book ‚ÄúDopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence‚Äù based on one of his interviews of the author.

I have a pain in my lower right quadrant. More of a burning feeling with mild nausea. I would call it a discomfort. But the real discomfort is my mind, wondering if this is the night it gets bad enough that I have to go to the hospital. 

This has happened before, but not for a long time. I forgot how scary it was, and I'm sorry that I have to remember now. Why was it not enough of a scare the first or second or third time I had abdominal pain 1-2 days after drinking? Will it be enough this time? I definitely hope so. 

I have been having longer sober periods and when I do drink, it is much less than before. I'm on day 2 now. I just read a post this morning where I learned about the phenomenon where withdrawals get worse after time even with drinking less. I hope that person is doing ok now. I don't want to be that person going away in an ambulance, but I know I could be soon. I'm not special. 

My reasons for quitting lately have been things like ""my appearance/weight, my anxiety, my productivity, and my relationship"" somehow in that order. That's a separate issue. My internal physical health needs to stay at the top of that list, because without it, I have none of those other things.

I also just remembered my afternoon snack was very spicy, so some of this indigestion could be that. I want to be at the point where I don't have to wonder if I have burning in my GI system because of a stray jalepeno or because of my organs finally failing. This part is morbidly funny to me. 

Anyway, thanks for reading my middle of the night thoughts. I hope for a morning where being tired at work from being up all night is the least of my worries.

Stay healthy, friends, and do that by staying sober. The alternative is not a road I want to ponder, but pondering it would be good for me to do sometimes.

About two months ago now I realized it was destroying my relationships, my confidence, my mental state, etc. so I decided to stop. 

So I‚Äôm on extended vacation now with my family, and about three times (in a 3 week span) I‚Äôve had one beer. So three beers total, all on different days. When offered more, I declined and kept it to one beer which I surprisingly didn‚Äôt even want to chug down but rather enjoy over good conversation. I actually refilled the beer with soda afterwards which sounds weird but made me feel better for some reason. 

My question is‚Ä¶is this really terrible? Am I leading myself down the wrong path again if I am able to learn to drink one and stop? Is it okay to drink an occasional beer or low alcoholic content drink? I have no desire to take shots or drink mixed drinks (well‚Ä¶I do but I know where that leads so I stay away).

new username, new start.

I have gotten to the other side of the physical stuff, no DTs or anything too bad this time but feeling miserable. feeling feelings for the first time in a while. regret, pain, sorrow, grief, embarrassment, and above all else... shame.

Saturday I spent the entire day puking and shitting my guts out. I thought I was going to die.

I've nearly died three times this year while intoxicated on alcohol. including a ski crash and a car crash I have no business walking away from.

I'm sitting with a good friend & the cocktail waitress asks if we want another round. I ordered a soda water & bitters, my buddy a gin & tonic.

She comes back & sets the drinks down. The one in front of me is clear so the first thing I think is ""oh they forgot the bitters"". Being half annoyed I didn't think to look at the color of the drink in front of my buddy. So I go to take a sip... and nope they didn't forget the bitters, it was clear because it was the gin & tonic!

I immediately jump back in my seat and say ""Oh shit that's alcohol... duh!"". And sure enough, the drink across from me is indeed the proper color. I quickly grabbed the nonalcoholic drink and continued on trying to not make it a big deal.

Well, it wasn't a big deal. Luckily, it didn't make me want to have a drink. Now I know that if I had actually ordered a regular cocktail and drank it, I would end up having 10 more. But thank god the one accidental sip didn't do that to me. Plus my buddy sitting across from me was pretty hammered, sloppy drunk. So that was a deterrent. Especially thinking how that used to be me.

Overall it was reassuring to know that I am still strong with my sobriety and the first real test didn't make me crave it at all. I can say that this is true especially with the help & support from this amazing community. 

Now I do not recommend that just anyone go hang out in situations where there's alcohol, even if you're feeling cooped up & FOMO. Please, your sobriety is much more important than any little itch to ""socialize"" & trust me you will be so glad when you wake up sober the next morning. Just because I did doesn't mean you should. I just wanted to share my story with you all.

I'm not resetting my days sober counter because it was an accidental sip.

He then turned to me on the way home and told me he's proud of me. That felt really good. :)

This time I woke up fully clothed in my bathtub with my apartment flooded and my head barely above the water. I still don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt drown that night, much less why I got into my tub fully clothed. I found out I was kicked out of another bar and the people I was with talked the bar out of calling the cops. I don‚Äôt share this story often as it‚Äôs embarrassing but the next morning I woke up realizing I needed a change. After 20 years of binge drinking, hospital visits for intoxication and injuries from drinking, withdrawals, & damage I did to most relationships in my life...I woke up that morning and decided I needed to stop. I always say that my nine lives are running low and I had to stop chancing it.

To say it‚Äôs easy would be a lie. I‚Äôve become more comfortable with admitting I‚Äôm an alcoholic. I am also fully aware that I can slip any day if I don‚Äôt hold myself accountable. Heck, I still have nightmares where I wake up in a cold sweat thinking I relapsed (even had one last night). It‚Äôs not easy staying sober but I won‚Äôt give up on my sobriety.

Last Friday, on my official 3 year celebration, I didn‚Äôt have many to share this news with. I rarely say I‚Äôm proud of myself but with this, I am. I‚Äôve been a longtime lurker of this sub since I quit drinking. It‚Äôs given me hope when I‚Äôve felt down and strength when I‚Äôve felt weak. It‚Äôs made me feel less alone. I thank each of you for that.

The most embarrassing part was on Christmas Day. I woke up and was supposed to spend the day celebrating with my family. Instead, I lied to my family and told them I was going to spend Christmas with my girlfriend and her family. I then lied to my girlfriend and told her I was going to celebrate with my family 1.5 hours away. Instead, I bought a box of wine and got absolutely hammered in my dark apartment while watching YouTube and tv all day.

I‚Äôm posting here today because yesterday I made another commitment to quit drinking. I say ‚Äúanother‚Äù because while I‚Äôve been drinking heavily for a dozen years, I‚Äôve made real efforts to quit. I‚Äôve done the tapers, I‚Äôve gone weeks without a drink.

But inevitably, I relapse.

I relapse because I have a physical condition that is incredibly painful and incurable, and often I don‚Äôt have access to healthcare to treat it. I relapse because I feel so damn alone in this new city. I relapse because the only person I can talk to is my wonderful partner, and it‚Äôs exhausting to them to hear me spill my guts every night about my suffering.

No more. They‚Äôre threatening to leave because of my alcoholism, and there‚Äôs no way I can continue treating them this way. There‚Äôs no way I can continue killing myself in front of them and avoid the obvious resentment that builds up. There‚Äôs no way I can keep my marriage vows while still maintaining my problematic relationship with alcohol. There‚Äôs no way for me to continue to excuse myself drinking.

And there‚Äôs no way for me to continue drinking without incurring these side effects. Every time I take a sip, some goblin in me awakens and shouts ‚ÄúMORE! More more more! Throw the whole damn handle down! More!! I want EVERYTHING!!‚Äù

It‚Äôs about damn time I accept that my drinking days are over. I can‚Äôt satisfy the goblin, ever. It‚Äôs hurting my relationship with the person I care about most. It‚Äôs hurting my health. It‚Äôs hurting my mental health. I have a physical on Wednesday, and I resolve to ask for Antabuse. 

I refuse to be a slave to alcohol any longer. I‚Äôm honestly heartbroken by this, somehow. What slave is heartbroken by the thought of freedom? An indoctrinated one. Somehow, like the indoctrinated slave I am, I keep trying to rationalize ways I can drink, but controlled. In my heart though, I know that doesn‚Äôt work because I‚Äôve seen it not work. It never does, and I‚Äôm sick of pretending it might. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready. But I cannot lose the light of my life. I can‚Äôt!! They‚Äôre so special, and I will never find someone else as perfect for me as they are.

I‚Äôm so scared. I‚Äôm so scared of the withdrawal effects, even though I know I‚Äôll be monitored by a doctor. I know they will suck. I‚Äôm so scared of who I might be without alcohol. I used it to use it to ‚Äúloosen up‚Äù and with a touch of autism I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be capable of being vulnerable again. I‚Äôm afraid that, without alcohol, I won‚Äôt be able to make friends ever again. 

I‚Äôm resolved, but quaking in my shoes. Any and all support welcomed, because there is no option to fail this time for me. This it. The final countdown. To my life as I know it, or losing the best person I‚Äôve ever known and possible homelessness.

With a heavy heart, I give up my relationship with alcohol, which for years helped me through difficult times  Which helped me not kill myself. Which gave me times free of stress. You were a bandaid, but I was using you to cover a gaping wound. No amount of bandaids will heal a gaping wound, what you need is medical intervention.

Did you know that sobriety does not automatically solve all problems?","15 months without alcohol. I'm super proud of the progress I've made, and I'm really excited about the way things are going. But lately, now that I'm working full time again and doing more real adult type stuff, I am seeing that my old problems with social anxiety and rumination/depression and all sorts of stuff are still very much there. I didn't expect them to resolve themselves; I honestly just forgot about them. I haven't had to consistently deal with this much social pressure in years, and now that I'm here, I'm feeling overwhelmed and stressed and unprepared.

Now, really, I have to say I think I'm doing pretty well. If you compare me to my drunk self a few years ago, I'm doing amazing. But one of my problems is, I'm not comparing myself to my old self. I'm comparing myself to my peers (or my image of them), seeing them with their shit together, so worried about how they're comparing themselves to me, and I'm being just insanely neurotic about the whole thing. When I think about it, I know I need to heavily chill out, and just be more patient and let myself figure things out. The right way forward is probably in the middle, where I'm patient with myself and allowing enough time to learn things, but also actively doing stuff to improve my situation, even if it's just to feel like I'm not doing nothing.

What did you guys do when you got sober and realized there was still so much stuff left to work on? Was it a challenge to keep your sobriety while working on your mental health? (Do you think it's ridiculous to say ""sobriety"" and ""mental health"" as if they're separate things?)

We're assigned to a time which obligates us to sit in a bar for 50 minutes prior to play. They confiscate water bottles prior to entry to this place to encourage drink purchases. There are 3 virgin cocktail options, all ¬£8 each. Expensive quarter cups of sugary juice with shaved ice and  a lime wedge. My boyfriend tries to buy me one. I stick to tap water.

My triggers for drinking are always the same: being sad, and being alone. So I'm very unbothered by addictive tendencies during a lovely mini golf date. I encourage him to get a nice cocktail. He knows I'm a recovering alcoholic just a month sober, and does not ask me to try it.

And I was happy, on Sunday, and very hydrated after 3-4 glasses of tap water - hydration is my new vice. But it occurs to me that eventually, I'll probably be bored in tap water situations. And frustrated how exposed I am to my partner - how much I have drilled it into him that I am an alcoholic and I cannot drink in a positive way. I have sabotaged all hope in future drinking together enjoyably or normally. For as long as he knows me, for the next however many years, if he sees me take a sip, he'll know it's a mistake as well as I do.

God, I just... I fucking love it. If I end up fucking bored it's the result of the absence of excitement, yes - and also the absense of terror, anxiety, fear and shame. Would I rather be bored, or having my heart racing a thousand miles per hour at 4am trying to figure out who I called last night and what I said? Is there excitement in trying to gauge how upset someone is with you based on nasty things you don't even remember saying? I am never bored when planning out how I'll access my next drink or what methods I'll take to isolate from my loved ones to hide my substance abuse from them this time. I'm not excited, or happy, or present, either. It's mechanical consumption. Momentary pleasure and relief, followed by a length of misery - span undetermined. Could just be the next morning, could be the next few years if the humiliation was spectacularly soul destroying. In sobriety, my soul is safe. Mending, even.

And as for exposed - you know, it's hard to feel easy to love when you're an alcoholic. I struggle every day to love myself, so why wouldn't anyone else?

The truth is, in opening myself up to my partner and being accepted for exactly who I am, I feel... loved. And I'm not hiding anything anymore. I'm not hiding alcoholism, or bottles, or stains, or secrets. And he can help me when I'm honest. It's not just not asking me to taste his drinks. He advocates for my sobriety with continued words of affirmation, consideration of accessibility for my soberness for social outings, and celebrates my milestones with me. 

This also means that I now care *so, so much* about staying sober. Because I don't want to lie to him, so if I relapse, I'll face disappointing both of us. I know he'd help me back on the wagon without an unkind word to me, but still. This helps it stick.

All in all, being present and sober isn't always great. But it's so, so much better than what I was handing myself before now.

Several from car accidents, some from illness, but dammit, many of them were from drug and alcohol abuse. I just received an invite to a memorial for a student who I had when I taught high school over 20 years ago. He came back home three years ago from out west to get clean and dry up. The party life he led in LA and Las Vegas was taking its toll on his now 30ish body. He came back to our small town and worked at a local tap room as a bar tender and waiter. It was great to reconnect with him and his older brother, as they were both great students and just nice all-around people. Our son loved him and his seemingly boundless energy and love of life. Decisions on where to go eat were met with ‚ÄúIs Jim working tonight?‚Äù A text was sent, and if he was, there we went. 

Several weeks prior the lockdown last year, I got a message from his older brother that he was in the hospital and was not doing well. The old habits that he tried to escape out west were back here in MI and were putting an end to his young life. I desperately wanted to go and see him and possibly say goodbye, but with the world going crazy with COVID, non-family visits to the hospital were forbidden. So, as I rushed to get my classes moved online, my stress and my anxiety were through the roof, and my drinking was out of control. 

I got a message from his brother on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day. It was a pic of him holding his brother‚Äôs hand with a rosary around it and the words ‚ÄúI was with him until the end.‚Äù I died a little inside that day, but instead of being proactive and focusing on my health, I drank even more. 

The guilt that his brother was feeling about not being able to help him was huge. The frustration with not being able to give him a proper burial and memorial during COVID was overwhelming for his very large Catholic family. The brother started to blame himself for not saving him. The brother started questioning all his actions and wondering if he ‚Äúdid enough‚Äù to help him. I was neck deep in my own alcohol issues, so I couldn‚Äôt do much to help this guy in the depths of his grief. 

When I opened the invitation and saw Jim‚Äôs smiling face on the card, it hit hard. ‚ÄúHelp us celebrate the life of a LEGEND!‚Äù it read, and for sure, that is the truth. He had business cards that he passed out around town with his name and the title ‚ÄúProfessional Manwhore‚Äù on them. His smile could light up a room, and his laugh could be heard from miles away. His memory is forever etched in my brain. 

It‚Äôs sad, but when you think about it, alcohol doesn‚Äôt give you a damn thing, it only takes from you.

What do you do for fun?‚Äù By this time in my life, I had already accepted that I didn‚Äôt believe in god, but I was still angry. I replied, ‚ÄúI only go because my parents force me to.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo why don‚Äôt you drink?‚Äù I remember pausing and thinking about it. I had no answer for it because it just never occurred to me. I replied, ‚Äúno one ever offered it to me.‚Äù No one had, that was the only real reason. I had built all these walls around me to blend in and just make it through HS so I could leave and get tf out of that small town. Alcohol, once on my radar, became very alluring to me as I thought it would be a way to just escape for a little bit. Just remove me from the equation for a little while. That week I was cleaning out my brother‚Äôs car for some money and I found a bottle of vodka in his glove compartment. I was scared when I found it. The first time I had seen alcohol in person. I stared at the blue bottle not sure of what I should do. That anger I mentioned earlier said ‚ÄúYes. Yes! This is it.‚Äù That was my 16th bday and I called my cousin and told him we were going to have a great night after all. It‚Äôs funny I remember throwing that blue vodka bottle back and forth till it was empty, but I don‚Äôt remember the fun and I don‚Äôt remember the aftermath. But it‚Äôs been 22 years now and I think I‚Äôm still in the ‚Äúaftermath‚Äù of that first Skyy bottle of vodka.

I woke up today and thought, ‚Äútoday is the day, you deserve this.‚Äù But I quickly renegotiated with myself, I mean a couple of bday cocktails won‚Äôt harm me, as long as I don‚Äôt get drunk it‚Äôs fine.

Before that I rarely even ever had a beer. Maybe it was the pandemic, who knows, but all my mental health issues just seemed to stockpile like never before. For a while I thought drinking was a relief, but I‚Äôm quickly learning otherwise - some background:

All my life I‚Äôve had to deal with pretty rough anxiety and Pure O - a kind of OCD that results in really dark, violent, shitty intrusive thoughts. For most people, those go in and out of your head as silly ‚Äúwhat if‚Äùs, but for people with OCD, they get ‚Äústuck‚Äù in your head. Your brain fixates on them and you feel like you HAVE to act them out to release you from your own prison. 

The easiest way to describe it would be that ‚Äúcall of the void‚Äù feeling - you‚Äôre standing out on your hotel balcony, and your brain is like ‚Äú‚Ä¶.you could just jump lol‚Äù Of course you don‚Äôt want to, but now your brain has shown you the possibility. Now, imagine that 24/7, with various dark thoughts you can‚Äôt escape from. ‚ÄúWhat if I snapped one of my own bones? What if I maimed myself in some gruesome way? Someone else?‚Äù Just on loop. You go through days scared to even move, the OCD making you think you have to act this out, but you know you won‚Äôt, because you still have some logical thought. It‚Äôs tiring, and anxiety heightens it even more. It‚Äôs barely living.

Alcohol has been my way out of all of this when it happens, and as it got worse. I didn‚Äôt even need to get sloppy drunk, just a straight shot or two. As long as my head was ever so slightly swimming, these thoughts and feelings persisted, but the fear edge was gone. I felt ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

I stopped drinking because of my general inability to do anything in moderation, and because I was genuinely worried that I was one bad blackout away from not waking up again.

Over these past 2 years I have grown so much as a human. I finally learned how to trust myself again, which quite frankly was a huge driving factor for me to quit in the first place (because I simply could not trust myself after having a few drinks, and that distrust permeated throughout so much of my waking life). I was never an alcoholic in the sense that I craved alcohol. I had zero problem quitting cold turkey, and never came close to relapsing. I do miss the social aspect however.

I have tried to remain social while being sober, and WOOF - it has been hard. It‚Äôs crazy to realize how much of my social life was predicated on drinking. Dating is insanely hard now. Just hanging with my friends and watching football is tough. My friends support me 100%, but it just is not the same‚Ä¶it is hard to describe.

I am debating how I can START drinking again. For those who were in a similar situation as me‚Ä¶how bad an idea is this? I finally trust myself to be disciplined in my drinking and setting and abiding to strict limits, but I do fear that after that first sip I am going to feel an immense sense of guilt that will immediately strip me of all of the incredible progress I‚Äôve made over these 2 years.

A few observations from the last ten years... it was not my first attempt to quit.  It was one of several, but thankfully the last. The difference the last time was that I sought help AND my mindset was receptive to getting help. Treatment centres helped. AA meetings helped. Having friends that supported my sobriety helped.  Not hanging out around alcohol helped.  There's more, but the above were the main pillars of my recovery.

I have had some very dark times over the past ten years, but I've also had some amazing, fantastic times also. Through it all I did not drink. I have a career, a relationship, hobbies, passions, goals etc. I had none of those while I was drinking.

If you're struggling today I send you my thoughts. I've been there, and survived.  You do not need to drink today. Or tomorrow.

Some people call it a 'swap'. Looking back it seems like a no brainer, but it was the most difficult thing I ever did.

BIG mistake, work got stressful and next thing I knew I was secretly taking swigs out of the bottle.

It culminated in a two day bender on Wednesday and Thursday where I drank probably a fifth each day. 

I don‚Äôt think I experienced any withdrawal symptoms last time I quit, just anxiety without an easy ‚Äúcope‚Äù, but this time is different. I‚Äôve had nausea, sweating and no appetite the last 3 days (no shakes oddly enough) as well as night sweats and insomnia the last couple of nights.

I‚Äôd heard of kindling and I‚Äôm scared of the more severe effects of withdrawal, so I decided to taper, which has so far been successful. I‚Äôve felt very resolved to quit so so far tapering has gone well in that I have followed the schedule and haven‚Äôt gone over.

I had my brother over yesterday and spilled my guts to him. I told him I didn‚Äôt want to tell my wife (a decision I detailed in my previous post) and risk the damage to our relationship.

After tossing and turning with night sweats next to my sleeping wife, I made the decision to go ahead and tell her everything this morning.

THIS ENDED UP BEING A GREAT DECISION! 

I know it‚Äôs not for everyone‚Äôs situation, but my wife was understanding and sympathetic (though shocked, she really had no idea). She‚Äôs a nurse so she also made me feel better about my withdrawal concerns and will be helping me through this.

I‚Äôm quitting for good this time, this experience has been HORRIBLE, and I‚Äôm so glad to get this off my chest to the person I don‚Äôt want to keep any secrets from.

A commenter on my last post suggested telling my wife and I didn‚Äôt feel it was right for me, so I just wanted to come back and share my experience of how wrong I was and immortalize how terrible going back to Day 1 has been.

""What happened to you?  Instead of,  what's wrong with you?""

There is nothing wrong with you!  I've had a deep seeded anger since i was 5 years old.  At age 12 alcohol (that my mom provided) 'relieved' that anger, or so i thought.  If you grew up in a chaotic home surrounded by domestic violence, divorce, alcohol, drugs, guns, sexual assaults, fighting, police visits, etc you are not alone!!   Adults who I trusted to take care of me violated my trust.....continually.  Maybe my mind loves the chaos from my childhood and in some f$^$ up way i feel safe in chaos.

Few people know about my past, and they are baffled when I tell them.  I used this as fuel to have a better life, but also tried to use my past as an excuse to drink.  What i do know is alcohol is not going to get rid of the pain/anger from your past.  We've got to get it out some other way.

I'm 26 male, Spanish, have lived abroad (China and Russia), went to a good college but then fell off the good track and started drinking too much. When I was in Russia it was so socially acceptable to drink vodka with every meal that my health began to deteriorate real quick.  I thought it was my liver but had it checked out by a couple doctors and turned out that it was just a humongous, crippling depression. I couldn't sleep well, barely talked, had no sexual drive, felt really stupid, had hangxiety and night sweats, and it got worse to the point where I couldn't eat regular meals (I rejected the food for some reason). One Lebanese ""friend"" started helping me out and forbid me to drink, but I couldn't get rid of my depression. Also, since I couldn't think with a clear mind, I was deceived and scammed by him. Finally I came to my senses and went back to Spain, so my family could take care of me. 
My depression got better and I quitted alcohol with the help of a good shrink (I am taking anti depressive meds and some sleep pills). My parents were really helpful and together we overcame my addiction. I started working out, having a balance diet and sound sleep, took up new hobbies (cooking, learning Classical Chinese) and so on. Thus far it's the typical feel good, success story. My phisical appearance also improved a lot, I was lean with pretty low body fat and trying to gain muscle. Got rid of my beer tummy. Started studying logistics and supply chain management, got hired by Amazon. Went on sober dates with Chinese girls (that helped me too, since Spanish girls tend to overdrink and I am fluent in Chinese). 
And then I messed it up big time. 
One of my meds (Sertralina) was giving me some nasty side effects, the main one being that I couldn't experience any sexual arousal. I went on for weeks without masturbating or having sexual thoughts. I complained several times to my doctor so he agreed to change my treatment. After a couple of days, I started feeling ridiculously horny and anxious. On the third day I had a date with a girl that I liked a lot. She's kind, interesting, beautiful and last but not least, sober. So I asked her out and she was happy to oblige. We had the perfect date, went to the royal palace in Madrid, had ice cream, made dinner for her, etc. At one time she was leaning into me, I misread the situation and tried to kiss her. She gently refused and we keep talking about other things, I cracked a couple jokes to ease the tension.
 But deep inside I felt broken. I really thought that my relationship with her was going somewhere and felt extremely disappointed. Out of sadness, I called a couple of my old drinking buddies and we drank a lot (mostly gin). After that, I went home but on the street I met some guys and I just invited them to my place. I was feeling typsy and playful, I guess, and one of these total strangers was a fairly good looking Latino women. So we drank all night and make a mess in my apartment.
 Today morning I woke up with a manageable hangover but extremely excited and horny for some reason. Out of despair, and for the first time in my life, I reached out to a prostitute that scammed me one thousand euros and never showed up. Then she ghosted me and run away with the money. 
I had never wanted sex so bad as too solicit sexual services, and I am deeply embarrassed by it. I want to justify myself by saying that is part of the side effect of the withdrawal from that medicine, but deep inside I know these poor life choices are caused by alcohol. I am not a violent or dangerous person, but alcohol makes me loose control sometimes. Anyhow, now I am sitting in my filthy, post-party apartment, had to take a one day leave at my job, didn't show up for a meeting, etc. This is the lowest I've ever fallen, definitely has been my rock bottom. Nevertheless, I am decided not to drink anymore, and I will resume my treatment with sertralina, even if it pains me too. 
I just want to share this with you guys so you can see all the bad things that can happen in a single day of drunkenness, and so I can mentally prepare to stop drinking again. Alcohol is not worth it and it makes you an awful person. Long live to sober me.

I am just posting here because recently I have been struggling with urges to drink again. I don‚Äôt drink socially and haven‚Äôt done so for years. I drink to escape. 

I am currently in a health facility (in Australia) looking into psychosis caused by my drinking and drug use and about to start work on some past trauma that has blocked me from my feelings.

The latter scares the hell out of me. My psychiatrist has already noted that I have strong defences set up to protect myself but the psychologist I will be working with has a good reputation of breaking these defences down. I guess due to hearing about other patients experiences I want to run and hide. 

I have been having urges to leave the facility and drink over the last 24hours and have even been tempted to drink the hand sanitiser (as we are in lockdown and it‚Äôs easily accessible)‚Ä¶it wouldn‚Äôt be the first time. 

I am here simply to vent so I thank you all for giving me the time and space. I know I must not drink and whilst I need to live in the here and now, I cannot escape my past as it has ramifications on me now.

It's like some cognitive dissonance. I've been addicted to this thing for years and I would panic when I couldn't get enough alcohol before the stores would close.

And now I don't feel anything for it? 


I'm really scared this feeling of apathy for alcohol will go away but at this moment I am thankful for whatever possessed me to finally stop drinking.

Well, tomorrow is 100 days AF. One of the things I found particularly useful was reading lists of observations of what happened along the way that other people posted, of what worked for people - so here is my contribution back! These are in no particular order and I wrote them down as they came - there may be some slight repitition and spelling mistakes  - this aint no Medium article and I am not claiming all of the words of wisdom as my own!

Here's to the century!

1. Do not stop stopping. It‚Äôs taken me several years of work to get to (nearly) 100 days and I feel awesome. Each ‚Äòfailure‚Äô I learned from (only now I realize that though). I got better. My skills and tools evolved. I kept reading quit lit. I kept doing ‚Äòthe work‚Äô and I have matured into who I‚Äôm am now. 

2. I learned that white knuckling it will never work in the long run, understand the reasons why you drank- I don‚Äôt want to drink now and urgers never last long!

3. The biggest life/bio hack no one ever told you about is to quit drinking. Forget diets, meditation, exercise, energy healing etc etc - quit the drink first and eventually it all falls into place - I do all those other things now btw‚Ä¶except the energy healing (maybe I should try??)!

4. Release yourself from expectations and try not to do it all at once. I quit drinking, then quickly I started a meditation practice, journaling, gratitude diary, new online learning courses - this was it!! I was going to transform every aspect of my life!!!‚Ä¶..and failed repeatedly by setting the bar so high. Do one of them (quit drink) and let the rest come naturally over time.

5. My anxiety and sub clinical (?) depression disappeared within weeks after I quit. I became happier. I stopped looking to other people for validation and went with making myself happy!

6. If you are continuously struggling with day 1, change the community around you. I had to step away from an amazing online recovery community because I started to focus on the people who were ‚Äòfailing‚Äô. I found another online recovery community that worked for me - Over the Influence podcasts at the time (OTI). There is no one true tested path that fits all on this journey - find what works for you!

7. When I was struggling with day 1 after day 1 etc I started a video diary and started talking to myself. Why was I failing myself? Be brutal and honest - this helped me a lot! From time to time I go back to some of the 'failed' day 1‚Äôs and see the pain in my eyes‚Ä¶

8. One thing that resonated with me was a comment by someone on Reddit ‚Äò giving up drinking is easy, it is the absence of doing something. All you have to do is not drink‚Äô!!

9. I was a grey area drinker on the slow slide to a problem drinker. My anxiety and sub clinical depression were becoming concerning, along with the intrusive thoughts that had recently started to affect me. I‚Äôm thankful for the pandemic as it probably saved me a few years of fighting wanting to quit, continuing to fail and a subsequent proper bottom. I did have some real internal low moments leading up to quitting.

10. If you are questioning your drinking you have a problem - period! A lot of people I know who drink seem to have dependency issues but comments on this will never help - it is up to them to figure out if they want a better life. All you can do is be a ‚Äòlighthouse‚Äô. 

11. I can deal with life far easier now I am not operating at 60%. On this note, I truly believe I have been living my life with one arm tied behind my back and am excited to see where this new path takes me.

12. Recovery fatigue is real. Sometimes you need to step away - it‚Äôs fine, I still listened to the pods but social media is a devil that needs to be controlled.

13. I took a lot of baths!

14. I remember sitting there with a few friends years before I quit and at the time I was really (internally) questioning the motivations of why I was drinking - it must have been a low moment for buddies of mine as they admitted that some days their anxiety from a Saturday night out got so bad all they could focus on was getting the kids to bed and hoping Monday was better - that was an additional lightbulb moment for me as I realized I was not alone and a lot of people have strained relationships with alcohol.

15. Alcohol is a severely addictive substance that, over time, has dire affects on your mental health. Let‚Äôs not even talk about the physical health problems and abhorrent societal impact it imparts on all of us. If you suffer from depression, drinking alcohol is a terrible idea. For myself - it was all mental lows- not physical.....so it was easier to hide.

16. I guard my sleep now. It is a fundamental upon which I base all else on. I have no idea how I managed to function properly in the years leading up to quitting given how I feel now. I sleep so well now!

17. I put on weight in the 1st month replacing booze for cake and ice cream. I didn‚Äôt care - I set a 6 month time frame to lose the weight. At the end of 3 months sober I stopped caring about how I looked in other people‚Äôs eyes. I still wanted to get in shape but the motivation had completely changed. I have lost all that weight now.

18. You will have bad days. Days where you just feel down and days you just want to crawl into bed. Life is not easy at times. Life is not fair. Nothing will change that. When you take away the crutch, you have to deal with life. Now I deal with the problems that arise instead of having beers/wine to take the edge off hoping someone else will deal with them for me!

19. I started to put one foot in front of the other to implement actions I had been talking about for years - deeds not words! 

20. People start to open up about their drinking and concerns to you. Listen, tell them how your life has improved beyond all expectations (I presume it has). Tell them it still sucks from time to time. Tell them what works for you but unless asked don‚Äôt tell them what to do - let them take that first step.

21. The first 2 weeks were tough, then it got easier and then it got pretty tough again (different from the first 2 weeks though). In her book The Sober Diaries, Claire Pooley describes how most people do the really hard stuff over and over again (quit for 30 days or so and then go back to booze) without experiencing the really good stuff (>100days). I'm beginning to see what she means and am really enjoying myself right now - give it a go! 

22. Alcohol stole my confidence and the only way to bring it back was to have some ‚ÄòDutch courage‚Äô but now I see the crippling imposter syndrome that has plagued my career and personal life was down to the drinking and the temporary relief was just that. I have never had this level of confidence!

23. People aren‚Äôt talking about you. When you are not around, they don‚Äôt sit around and spend the evening gossiping about what you are doing; get over yourself!! Everyone is dealing with their own shit and most people are just trying to get through to the end of the day mentally intact!

24. Not drinking is a reward, it is not a punishment. Watch how your life changes for the better!

25. Someone posted on Reddit that getting sober was like switching the game of life from hard to easy on a video game - I like that!

26. I trust myself a lot more. I trust in the decision I make and don‚Äôt have to farm out decisions that affect me to others!

27. More often that not, i wake up every day feeling better than the day before!

28. I remember growing up I was this really happy child. I look back with fondness when i see pictures of myself as a kid. Somewhere along the way that got lost. Life got strained and difficult, and for some reason I turned to alcohol to numb it all. As Brene Brown says you can‚Äôt selectively numb the pain. You numb it all. I wanted to get back to that kid who enjoyed life and I feel like I‚Äôm getting there!

Over the last couple of months (last year?) I have quit ... and then had wine with friends, quit, had drinks on a date, quit, wine for my mom's birthday. You get the picture. But during that time I have come to realize that the drinking itself (although bad bad bad) is not even the thing I want even want to avoid. It's the aftermath. Call it anxiety, but my brain goes on overdrive overthinking everything i've ever done. I replay all my mistakes in the past, am convinced so-and-so hates me, feel like an idiot.  And I haven't really equated it to drinking (because Im not worried about the night before) I'm  ruminating about past mistakes, coulda woulda shoulda... rather than future solutions. Once again, after a week without any alcohol I feel peace, detachment..  just more in the flow.  

**tl;dr :** if you're prone to overthinking (it's a miserable place to be) alcohol is 100% fuel for that overthinking brain.  Don't fuel that overthinker!

The real victories here (in my opinion) is when all the seeds you are sprinkling around start to grow.  That takes time.

I've had soberity stints of 12 years, then another 5 years.  So I've been around a while.  However in between that time, I let the moderation pixie ( stole that term from here!) convince me that I can moderate. Well, as all of us know,  that's complete bullshit.

Anyway, as much as I know drinking is something that's not right for me,  I'm not motivated to go to meetings. Since covid things different and I just lost desire to go. 

So as yesterday was day 1 for me,  I'm looking to get involved in this sub and begin to enjoy sobriety again.

It's funny I've read on here about our different  ""selves"". 

My sober self says one drink is too many 

My one drink self says one more can't hurt

My two drink self says,  just one more... that's it.

My 3 drink self says,  just one more bender, since I came this far. 

My bender self says let's get hammered!  Let's guzzle from the vodka bottle, since that's the definition of social drinking!!

My sober self says.. hey.. how'd that work out for you?

Not good.. never good.  I've never said, "" boy, I'm glad I drink l drank last night!"".

However my pride is so damn thick,  that I didn't want to admit that my 3 year experiment failed miserably, again!

Why do I feel ashamed that I can't drink. "" normally"", like it's a bad thing not to drink. 

Are we so conditioned by society that we think drinking is a necessary part of life? That you are simply a dysfunctional person if you can't drink?

It's so weird that people hold up drinks for a picture! That somehow having a drink in your hand makes it a better picture! Why don't we hold up glasses of water instead? Like ""hey,  look at me,  I'm getting my hydration on!""

Today I'm done trying to put a round piece into a square hole. 

Drinking is just not something that fits my best self.  It's just not. 

But damn it is hard to find regular dudes that think like this. Except here. 

Anyway, thanks for creating this sub, and allowing me to be part of it. 

I can't offer too much right now,  but I really feel welcomed just reading the posts. I'm finding that just reading, privides me some really great support!

Here I am after some significant time lurking and reading. 

I'm a military guy and in Japan. At age 30 my body has seriously deteriorated. 

Divorced (2017): no more kids, goodbye money, and after 6 years I heard my son call his step dad ""dad"" and me ""Reanu\_Keeves\_69"" That sucked. 

That's pretty much when the boozing really picked up. Being isolated, lonely, poor, replaced, and losing everything... that bottle was nice even if it was only temporary. Reality sucked.

Last year I did 4 months without drinking. I don't remember what I did to do that other than joining Boy Scouts as a leader, public speaking, and a small amount of dating. 

Moving here really took its toll. The job isn't the best, the massive amount of people and all the covid rules give me extreme anxiety, and so I finally bit the bullet and got on the anti-depressants. It worked for a little bit. 

We military love to drink. My god do we guzzle. Everyone does it and the good ole boy system exists whether you like it or not. I worked at the gas station in addition to full time active duty during the divorce times and it is amazing how much booze we put down.

Again, 30 has been my year. Spinal disc collapsed doing squats in the gym so it all hurts. Foot is busted from years of running, finally got diagnosed with sleep apnea (severe and sober). And I had a heart attack in June. That's right. Age 30. Apparently runs in the family. Maybe the covid vax helped but, I have no clue. I don't wish anyone to go through that.

Speaking to the guys in the service ""won't effect my career"" but, I've already done that. And yes it does. So here I am with you all. 

I know I have to stop but, I'm so tired from all of it. I should definitely not be boozing it up with all these injuries and condition but, the doctor just adds to my medical list and I can't afford to get out. 

My brain feels like I can't think clearly. It's actually really concerning. To those that have succeeded in quiting, I managed 4 months last year. My anxiety and depression didn't help but, I didn't notice a change in my mental fortitude. Information is hard to process, stuff I know from when I was younger is still there but, learning anything new is seemingly impossible. And again more anxiety from that. 

Can you recover from years of damage? I'd like to believe I can absorb information again like everyone else seems to be able to do. The age of 30 seems a little young for the mind to just stop.

I got to the church and was immediately welcomed, someone took me inside and introduced me to a few people, made me some really awful coffee, and we went to go and listen to the main share. No details obviously, as what's said in the rooms stays in the rooms, but I'll say it was a heavy, heavy story. 

Listening for similarities, not differences, I realised something which seemed to be common to so many of us, and it wasn't trauma, or tragedy, just a want to fit in. A longing to belong, a belief we aren't enough as we are, and the fallacy that a drink would make us so. It made me sad that I feel this way about myself, that so many people feel this way about themselves. 

It reaffirmed why I'm getting counselling, because these beliefs are strongly held, deeply ingrained, but ultimately untrue. I might not be happy with things I've done, decisions I've made, but there's nothing fundamental that's so wrong with me I need to change myself to fit in.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy Monday everyone! I hope everyone had a great Sunday. I slept in which is normally very challenging and enjoyed some coffee while reading your responses from Sunday‚Äôs check in, had a great workout with a friend, ran some errands, and then ended the day with a miserable fight with someone close to me about something that doesn‚Äôt even really matter. It‚Äôs resolved and all is mostly good now but sometimes things like this make me feel like drinking to just forget and to numb those bad feelings. 

One tool I learned from here early on is using the tool HALT. If I ever want to drink I ask myself am I:

H - Hungry 
A - Angry
L - Lonely
T - Tired

Sunday night I was angry and tired so I went to bed very early to sleep it off (with my alarm set so I could post this!) knowing that I would feel better in the morning after sleep and with my coffee.

What tools do you use to fight those cravings? I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from you!

So, I retreat into the room with my forbidden goods and lock the door behind me. Some hours pass and surprise surprise, I drank too much and blacked out for a bit. My memory is fuzzy but I threw up for sure. I had a passing thought of cleaning up in the shower but didn‚Äôt have enough sense to actually get in. I also dropped my phone for what happened to be one too many times and the screen popped off. When I couldn‚Äôt get it to turn back on I started crying out of frustration.

When I realized there was only about an hour before my bf was supposed to come back, I cried more because there was no way I‚Äôd be sober enough to hide the fact I‚Äôd been drinking let alone drive. I dropped onto the bed feeling helpless and cried while I waited for his return. 

He of course asked me if I was drunk, which I confirmed as I cried harder out of shame. He was upset, rightfully so, and we didn‚Äôt talk much for the rest of the night. I felt like garbage the next day, not hung over, but very regretful of the decision I made.

I also ended up going to the ER. Not for another flare up of pancreatitis, but because I was concerned that I‚Äôd caused an intestinal blockage after accidentally swallowing a stone when I was drunk.

Even after all that, it wasn‚Äôt enough of a wake up call.

2021-09-19 21:39:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/prl1xf/a_post_i_made_on_facebook_regarding_isolation/,A post I made on Facebook regarding isolation that I hope might help people reach out. It's made all the difference for me.,"I don't usually post super personal stuff on Facebook and I'm really conscious of the fact that oversharing in a public way is generally not a good look. I've got a lot of people friended on here, old friends, new friends, bosses. I feel that this is so important though, and if it helps just one person to feel less alone then it's worth the uncomfortability of visibility.

A lot of people know I've struggled with alcohol addiction. That awareness may be to a lesser or greater degree, but pretty much anyone who has spent time in my life knows. It's been impossible to hide completely, despite my best efforts, because when it takes hold of me it becomes such a presence in my life. It takes hold of the wheel and I become a passenger in my own life, and it takes me down roads that lead to very dark places. I spent much of my twenties blacked out drunk or completely unconscious, and when I was conscious I was so hung over, anxious and depressed that my actual self was completely absent. I've spent many mornings just waiting for stores to open so I could shakily drag myself over to buy more booze just to dull the hangover enough to go back to sleep.

I've been pulled from my home into an ambulance sobbing and protesting so many times I've honestly lost count. I've had enough stints in mental health facilities that I've lost track of that tally too. I spent my last birthday overnight in some hospital somewhere. I was too incoherent to even know where it was. Just an empty room with a single bed and an oppressive silence where I was left with nothing to distract me from the consequences of my decisions and the impossible question, where do I go from here?

In the past my shame and guilt about my addiction caused me to turtle up. My failures were an embarrassment to me and I just withdrew completely from the world and the people that loved me. I was unable to maintain friendships and my relationship with my mother and father crumbled and I didn't have the energy to rebuild them. I felt I was too much of a burden to be worth their time anyway. I was completely alone, and with no support system I would inevitably drink again to escape these feelings.

I got sober for a while and I was doing so well I thought hey, maybe now I can drink like a normal person. And for a while I did. A few drinks here and there to loosen up. I was okay. But it crept up on me, like it always does. It went from a couple on the weekends to a couple on weeknights too. I'd have a stressful day and think ""I'm just gonna have a few drinks tonight to take the edge off. Just tonight."" Then it was every night. The number of drinks went from two, to four, to six. It began to exacerbate my depression and anxiety disorder, even when I wasn't in the act of drinking the alcohol was depleting the good chemicals in my brain, was transforming me from a person who was functioning and generally doing well into a passenger in my own life again.

Then an event happened that triggered a full blown binge. I drank 55+ beers over the course of two days. Just sitting on my porch, knocking back beer after beer, crying and engaging in all the old self-destructive behaviors and thought patterns I had worked so hard to leave behind. My mom got scared and called an ambulance and there I was in those awful green scrubs again in an unfamiliar room, attended to by disaffected medical professionals. I begged for my release and they allowed it on the condition that I spend the next three days in the custody of my mother, and I spent three days in couch jail, just detoxing and muscling through hours-long chain panic attacks and sweating enough to completely saturate my clothes and the bedding. I had nothing but time to think.

I decided that this time, instead of turtling up and shutting people out, I was going to reach out to a few people I trusted and let them know what was really going on with me. Isolation sure as hell didn't work, and if reaching out didn't work either I'd be in the same situation as I would had I isolated, so what did I have to lose? So I talked to people. I didn't hold back. The guilt and shame were still there like ever-present sentinels guarding the path to connection, but I slipped right between them and let it all out.

And everyone, every single person, welcomed me with open arms, understanding and love. Not a single person turned me away. I began to rebuild the relationships I'd wounded with my distance, and I formed new ones with people I'd always wanted to get to know. My phone started blowing up with good morning texts, I started making plans with people (and following through), my days were filled with love and support and understanding. In the past I couldn't wait to get out of the hospital so I could drink again, and for the first time in my life sobriety felt different. I'd flirted with it before, but I'd never felt like more than a tourist in the state of sobriety, just passing through on my way home to alcohol. 

This time I never once felt the urge to drink again. Sobriety didn't feel like something I had to suffer through, it felt like a new friend who had all sorts of neat things to introduce me to. My life changed, opened up. The love I was receiving was filling the hole I had been dumping booze into. My desire to explore the possibilities opening up to me and the knowledge that if I continued drinking those possibilities would become impossibilities allowed me to accept something that was difficult to swallow; I could never have a healthy relationship with alcohol, and it could never be a part of my life. It was like losing a friend you had some very fond memories with but was ultimately toxic. It was hard, but these true friendships I have formed demonstrated to me that real friends don't hurt you like that.

In my twenties drinking was a fun activity I took part in socially, but as I aged it morphed into a solitary activity I took part in to escape. There are deeply rooted traumas in my past, and I want people to understand that I wasn't drinking for funsies. I was drinking because these traumas were just too great for me to deal with alone, or at all, and I chose the wrong partner to help me navigate them. I should have chosen better, but I can't undo the past. I'll never have that chunk of my life back, and I'm not where I should be with regard to processing and moving past my traumas because of it. But I can't hang on to bitterness about my wasted time. The only thing I can do is move forward from here in a way that actually makes progress on coming to terms with the pain I was running from so that I can finally put it behind me.

I'm sharing this because I'm hoping my story can help someone in the same situation. I know the stigma of addiction can lead to self-imposed exile from the world and from the people who love you. But isolation is not the answer. Reach out. Tell people what's really going on. 

Alcohol behaves like an abusive lover; it works to separate you from people who truly have your best interests at heart so it can have you all to itself. And when it does, it whispers lies. It tells you that it is the only one who will ever be there for you, because you're so broken and unlovable that no one else will ever accept you. And when you try to leave it, it calls to you with promises of comfort whenever something painful or difficult happens. It may comfort you that night, it may be sweet to you for a time. You think to yourself that this time it's different, but alcohol never changes. Just like an abusive partner, it will always show its true nature in the long run. The only way to free yourself from its lies is excision. There are no half-measures for those of us inclined toward addiction.

If you feel you don't have anyone in your life you can turn to, if you've destroyed those relationships beyond repair through drinking, turn to me. Even if we're not close. Even if you don't even know me and you stumble across this post somehow. I know the struggle better than I know the other side, my sobriety is still new, but it is a place I'd like you to visit with me. It is beautiful. Things grow here, lovely things that can't take root in the dark place you're in, that claustrophobic world where things are perpetually in stasis. Don't be afraid of being a burden to me; helping others gives me strength and confidence I never knew I possessed. It gives me a feeling of power that only solidifies my determination to remain here, with all the people who love me. Where I belonged all along.

A long rant.,"I replied to a post today that I am all too familiar with. Someone is struggling with quitting drinking and Vodka is their poison. Mine too! But I have got to change this and also get healthy again. To all those individuals that get that little voice talking to them, that it will be okay to have just one drink because you are better now, PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THAT VOICE......IT IS A LIE and one that I need to remember and learn from for the final time. To be honest, throughout my 10 years of sobriety, I did not miss it after a while, but I was also at the most peace I have ever felt in my life, even through the hard times. 

Just a little background, I quit drinking for 10 years and then decided to have a drink because I thought I could control it. NO, I CANNOT! Little by little, it sucked me back into nightly drinking and that was about 6 years ago. It began with wine and beer every now and then; however, I decided to go on the Keto diet about 2 years ago because my weight had gotten out of control. I am 5'1"" and weighed 170 pounds at the time. I started doing some research and found that liquor has zero carbs. Thus began my relationship with Vodka and Seltzer water (Bubly is my favorite). I thought to myself, ""Wow, I can still lose weight and still drink!"". Yes, I did lose weight. I am now 121 pounds, but my drinking is out of control. This addiction is a horrible sickness. It does not discriminate. Why am I doing this to myself, when I know that I was so much happier sober? This is a black abyss that is so difficult to climb your way out of once you are in the deep of it. It's like there are weights tied to your ankles keeping you down in the depths. 

To top things off, my work consumes me and is non-stop stressful. My husband and I are considering separating....more my idea, as we have many issues and he drinks every night as well, so this is a problem for me when I try to consider quitting again. I am also a graduate student at the very end of my Doctorate program which I am trying to get through before contemplating leaving. I have stopped for a few months at a time, but the last sober period was right before my father passed away from cancer in 2018. I have been at it daily since then and I am so sick of it!  

I want to change things and I have to this week, as I have taken a vacation for the first time in forever, and it would be so difficult to do while still going to work on a daily basis due to my position within my company and my responsibilities, as I am the Controller for our organization and amidst the normal stress, we have switched accounting systems and are dealing with the resurgence of the COVID variant, which I am responsible for our policies and procedures surrounding this pandemic, as well as the effects that this pandemic has had on supply issues for the machines we manufacture.  

So, this is my plan this time around. I need to hold myself accountable and REALLY try this time. I need to stay away from this horrible poison for good. Upon reading the other post today, I decided that I really need to taper before I quit as I am consuming way too much Vodka, to just quit cold turkey. I poured out about a fourth of a bottle of 1.5L Vodka and went to the store to get a 24 pack of Michelob Ultra. I AM NOT going to go to the liquor store to buy more Vodka. I plan on using this next week to taper and finally quit before I have to go back to work next week. I tried tapering before, but I caved in and got more Vodka. This is it. I have this week and I NEED to kick alcohol to the curb for the final time. I believe if I can get to 4 beers, I will go cold turkey at that point in time. I did it before and I can do it again! 

Sorry for the extremely long rant. I just need to hold myself accountable and be able to reflect back on this post when I feel like giving in! Hopefully, by the end of this week, I can also post that IWNDWYT.",10,"{'covid': 1, 'pandemic': 2}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47306782}"

- I've lost 35lbs since I quit drinking. Crazy how those empty calories and lack of motivation add up after a while!

- My kidneys are functioning at a normal level. My health was the reason I decided to ""take a break"" for a couple weeks (would never admit I was an alcoholic to myself or anyone) and then I just kept going.

- My time is now my own. My days aren't dictated by when I can get another drink; I can spend my hours as I please. As a result I am able to read more and have better quality time with my partner and my dogs! Plus I'm learning a new language which will lend itself to my long-term life goals. 


I went from basically drinking all day, every single day and never thinking about the future to actually working on me and it's the best thing I've ever done for myself. And believe me when I say that anyone can manage to do this if my drunk ass managed to pull it off.

Also, side note, today is officially 4 months alcohol free!

TLDR because I tend to ramble and over explain, does anyone have any tips on talking to a spouse about respecting your boundaries with alcohol while they drink?

A little back story, my husband and I used to drink together, loved beer tasting, etc. The problem was, he would only have one or two and I would have 5-6. After some less than stellar life circumstances, this turned into me getting black out drunk every single night. 

The first time I quit, I got so depressed I ended up committing myself to a mental hospital. I had a lot going on, and stopping cold turkey with no plan in place was a terrible idea. Got a few diagnoses and some meds that made me feel 1000x better. Naturally, I thought ‚Äúwell, that was my problem! Not alcohol!‚Äù and went right back to drinking. Started out okay, but quickly went back to getting black out drunk every night and fighting with my husband.

After a particularly bad night, (not that I remember) I woke up the next day in a shame spiral, everyone in the house was genuinely scared and concerned about my well-being and I decided enough was enough. 

Being more prepared, on the right meds, support in place I am currently in a really good spot when it comes to my mental health and alcohol free lifestyle.

I have told my husband from the beginning he can still drink whenever/whatever he wants and not to worry about me. At first he was a little uncomfortable and double checked with me, but it truly doesn‚Äôt bother me (thankfully!) and I made sure he knew that.

Now to the problem. I think he may be a little *too* comfortable. First he started asking me to buy him beer, and I made a comment about how I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for a person who has a previous alcohol problem to purchase it. He agreed, was understanding and picked it up himself. 

Well, this happened a few more times and I finally caved in and bought him some. Then when he is drinking, he will sometimes ask for me to bring him a beer, or even pour him a shot and bring it to him. I, of course, remind him it‚Äôs probably not a good idea for someone who previously abused alcohol to pour a shot and he always is very understanding and agrees.

Well, last night he partied a little harder than usual and I put away one of his ciders. It was still nice and cold, and I had my first intrusive thought about drinking. One of those ‚ÄúI could drink this and no one would know‚Äù that aren‚Äôt serious, but enough to feel like a punch in the gut.

I decided that although I am comfortable with people drinking around me, that doesn‚Äôt mean I should put myself in situations like that and I think I need to set up some clear boundaries with him. It also doesn‚Äôt make me feel too great/supported that my husband is putting me in these situations if I think about it too hard. Before anyone gets upset with him, I have yet to have a serious discussion with him about how it makes me feel and he thankfully does not have to think about these kinds of things like I do, but I think it‚Äôs due time he starts.

I‚Äôm finding this line of figuring out/respecting my own boundaries with alcohol without making others feel like they have to tip toe around me a difficult one to balance on.

On a day-to-day level need drink in my life. I no longer feel the desire to drink. This alone would be impossible to comprehend 14 months ago.

But, I think of alcohol often; such thoughts are automatic, intrusive and out of my control. Besides, how can you not think of alcohol when we are exposed to it countless times per day? How I react to these thoughts and process them is in my control. Sometimes, just accepting and acknowledging a craving, noting it, and letting it pass without judgement is enough. Don't get annoyed or beat yourself up for thinking this, it's normal.

Breaking down the thought patterns helps me. Will alcohol bring any actual benefits? Do I want to actually be drunk, or is it something else I am cravings (HALT). Is it the thing / scenario that‚Äôs associated with drinking (meeting friends, going out..). When I think about it this way, I realise I don‚Äôt actually want to be drunk and I just crave something deeper.

I‚Äôm still seeing changes for the better with each new month.

In the 10+ years of my drinking I don‚Äôt know if I was ever truly happy and content..

I never learned how to socialise and meet new people without alcohol. I‚Äôm actually more confident and outgoing and comfortable in my own skin now, than I ever was drinking, and this is something that only keeps on improving.

I regret the time, money and health I sacrificed.

I thought I was functioning. But alcohol controlled every aspect of my life and held me back in so many ways.

It‚Äôs a cliche, but it gets easier. Those early hours / days / weeks, even months, are rough, but things begin to fall into place. Really.

Don‚Äôt overthink big events. The build up is the worse, after the first hour or so you will wonder why you wasted so much mental energy worrying.

I don‚Äôt want to ever moderate. I can‚Äôt moderate. Moderation is impossible for me. I‚Äôve tried and within weeks I was drinking more than I ever did. Moderation is too much work. I still do not understand people who ‚Äúdrink in moderation‚Äù. I never will. Never going down that route again.

I‚Äôm still learning to deal with emotions, good and bad, without numbing them with booze. This has being one of the most difficult, yet most rewarding things.

The pink clouds came and went. There were low points. PAWS is very real. I went through a few periods of being extremely angry. But it passed.

I‚Äôve drifted away from some old friends but I'm learning to make new ones.

You will likely develop a sweet tooth. I went though many identity crises. I became obsessed with music for a while. I did yoga every morning, for about a week. 

It seems like everything in my country (UK) revolves around drinking. It‚Äôs terrifying.

More people have questioned my drinking and told me I have a problem since I stopped drinking than in the 10+ years I drank heavily.

I lack a robust sober support network; this is something I am working on. 

Despite everything and you still think about wanting a drink. Go to bed. Get up early. You will thank yourself the next day. Seriously.

You may have more free time. Sometimes too much. This is ok. Don't feel the need to be productive all the time, especially in those early days and weeks.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44603276}"

Ive skipped a day of drinking before many times. So i know what to expect - nothing negative will happen and i will enjoy being sober. I will also sleep better. And will have no guilt Tomorrow. 

So, why do i drink in the first place? As far as i can tell, i think that alcohol will make my evening ""better"" and allow to ""skip"" all the boring parts. **Yes, i know its not true. This is how a mind of an addict works.**

The interesting idea is this:  
What if i drink because of some imaginary fear about the future? Like, fear of boredom or fear of insomnia etc. But those fears are always in the future, and never in the present.

I am currently enjoying my sober evening. Its calm and pleasant. These fake alcohol ""benefits"" don't seem to exist in the present moment. I am not suffering in any way because of choice not to drink.

I'm so miserable every day and I don't know how to fix it. I also feel the need to preface a lot of things and get my history summed up before I ask for the advice I need. I don't know where to start so I'll start with my biggest issue. 

Alcohol. I've been drinking ever since I was 14, maybe 15. I've never been able to stop after one. I have ups and downs, I've never gone 30 days without a drink, hell the most I've done is probably 13 days, I've also gone on 2 week long benders where I'm just wasted all day everyday. My parents are both major alcoholics, I've only ever worked in restaurants and would always fall in line with the one other coworker that drank like I did, would get too confident, get fired, rinse & repeat. I use it to self medicate, to celebrate, to have fun, cure my bordem, or just plain drank because it was literally routine. 

My next issue is that the last year+, I've really started to resent having a job and having to work. I would work my ass off in a busy restaurant and really developed a good work ethic, when I wasn't completely overweight with my drinking. I loved serving, my parents talked about it my entire life, I wanted to bartend, I wanted to manage, I wanted to become an owner. In the year before lockdowns hit, my partner and I split up (unrelated reasons) and i moved to my dads in a different city. I worked with my dad and he serves food like he's selling pure cocaine to a drug cartel. He took it very seriously, it was his life. He and I are very similar in that way. Very introverted, neither of us make efforts to have friends, we both viewed work as our social life so we would fight for shifts and measure dicks on how many days in a row we worked or how many add on shrimps we up-sold. We drank after every shift and sat at those tabletop machines and sometimes gamble all our money away. We would go before work even. I picked up on his alcoholic tendencies which were worse than mine, but he's just much much, more functional. Everytime I heard Eminem say ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde, me and my daughter"", that's us. 

Anyway not to go on and on about my dad, he and I got into a fight and I was sick of the routine and my body was breaking down I lost so much weight. I moved away and back with my partner again a month before the lockdowns. After we reopened, that's when it changed and I couldn't stand it anymore. I was excited to go back and to make some tips, but holy shit did I come back to nothing but skeleton crews and incompetent panicky managers. I felt bad complaining because, I'm a server, a higher end one and I make great money, I get paid substantially more than your hourly worker and I got 6 months off after covid hit. But I don't know, something felt like it changed after all the lay offs, I just feel my patience was sliced too thin.

Ive been through 5 jobs since last September. I cannot seem to hold one down anymore. I start out okay but then I just, idk I lose it. I start drinking more, panic that I'm drinking more, quit, move on try again. I've tried jobs in different fields but hourly wages are fucking straight theft and slavery, I don't want to go back to restaurants because I just fucking drink non stop, but I feel so trapped because you just don't make enough money, even with $15/hr. 

Now, onto my partner. We'll call him Everette. He has been the most wonderful, sweet and supportive partner I think anyone can ask for. After covid we were able to get into a nice house, I went back to work and he managed to stay on boosted unemployment for much longer. While I was working, he was doing the laundry, taking care of the puppies, making sure I had dinner every night, just real straight ride or die shit. He's not much of a drinker at all, thank God I think I'd die if I was with somebody that was okay with my drinking. Because of that, he really doesn't like to see me drunk, he doesn't like to see when I'm on a bender or if I'm drinking for days straight, but he makes sure to let me know that he loves me and just wants me to get through this, he sees how much it hurts me. 

He's had very similar feelings about being anti-work and he wants to work from home. I bought him a very nice laptop so he can start editing videos and trying his hand at a new hobby. He has been elated to say the least, it's made him very happy and has lifted his spirits. He also went through a couple jobs this year, but was always still at least able to pull unemployment in if he just didn't like the job. 

Well about 2 months ago, he finally found one he likes, he makes the most amount of money he's ever made, he's very active at the job and is losing weight and honestly in the middle of an overall glow up and I could not be happier for him. I love him so. 

But then there's me. And I am a very very sad sack of shit. I feel myself pulling him down. He's been very frustrated at me because he feels overwhelmed and like he's trying to take care of two adults. I completely understand where he's coming from, albeit I don't like the way he says it to me sometimes but I can't blame him for being so angry. 

I'm just, on a downward spiral, I've been trying to keep track of my drinking and get it under control. I kept track, I drank 10 times in July, 5 times in August and I'm already up to 4 times this month. Just trying to get through even 30 days. But I'm realizing that I'm only trying to do this so hard so that after I get through it, I can pretend like I'm not an alcoholic and suddenly will be able to have a drink responsibly. 

I just feel myself getting worse. I drank last night at work, I'm just a front desk agent at a shitty motel, only had 2 arrivals. Well I passed out in the back for maybe an hour and the one housekeeping girl saw me. She didn't wake me up but she saw. I also talked to her last night, I don't remember about what but if I don't remember then that probably means I was obviously drunk. Now I don't even wanna go into work today, I don't wanna face another firing again. I'm anxious, I'm in shambles, I don't know what to do. 

A part of me wants to leave Everette, I can't see him getting so dragged down by me, I hate seeing that my feelings and my state of mind ruins his entire day. He wakes up so happy and he goes out and starts doing his daily chores and I just roll out looking like shit wanting to fucking kill myself. I hate putting him through this. I love him so much and I want nothing but for him to be happy and to succeed. 

But this is where the title comes in. I'm scared. Terrified. Shaking in my boots. He's the only good thing I can see in my life. I'm very codependent on him. But I'm so sad it's literally hurting him. I can't bring myself to help clean, I don't have any hobbies of my own, other than an interest in furniture restoring/building but I don't have tools for that, I hate every job I ever work, I'm unmotivated to get out of the house, I'm uncomfortable being sober and always need to either smoke weed til I just sleep or I break and I fight and claw my way to a white claw. I don't know why this man is with me. I feel like he's lying to himself when he agrees that I'm his best friend and he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. I feel like I've somehow brainwashed him or manipulated him. He says he doesn't want to break up, he doesn't want me to leave, he just wants to help.

I don't know what to do. I so desperately need help but I just can't find it or I don't know how to look. Therapy is so crazy expensive it breaks my heart. I just want to get away from all this and I don't want to just be so sad in my bed all day. Literally I won't move until I have to leave for work some days. Everette says it feels like he lives alone and that makes him sad, he just wants to play games and spend time with me and I just, idk I just can't. I miss him and I want time with him too but I just, am so tired all the time. I just want to sleep all the time.

I'm glad to get this all out here, I'm not sure what I'm really asking for but I guess just, do I need to bite the bullet and leave him? How do I stop drinking so much? How can I find happiness in something other than the bottom of a bottle? I'm miserable. 

TL;DR: I've been an alcoholic since I was 14/15, I've struggled with it for a very long time. Right now I'm in a depressive downward spiral and I don't know how to stop it now. My longtime partner of 7 years is getting a lot of his shit together and I'm just a garbage bag sitting in the bed sad all the time. I'm trying to stop drinking and I'm trying to put an end to all my toxic codependency traits but I just don't know how and I don't know if I should leave him.",8,"{'lockdown': 2, 'covid': 2}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5016348}"

Once my drunk alter ego took over, he decided it would be fun to message several people inappropriate things. One of those people was a recent former (mid to late 20s? It was a graduate level) student, and the message was lewd. He and I did not have that kind of rapport.

I didn‚Äôt even remember right away when I woke up, but eventually I recalled. 

I haven‚Äôt received a response yet, which could mean that he reported it to the program. At a minimum, he probably does not know how to respond. Beyond the crushing regret over making someone uncomfortable, this might end up costing me a job, and it would be completely justified.

This is a classic case of ‚Äúso far.‚Äù Even though I had plenty of reasons to stop drinking, I was always proud that it never affected my career. I forgot to think of it as being lucky that it hadn‚Äôt impacted my career SO FAR. Now, it seems that it may. Losing the job will set off a chain reaction, but I am trying not to think about it until the first domino officially falls.

Thanks for being here. It helped to write it while I‚Äôm spiraling inside.

Update: Heard back from the student, who was gracious and fortunately found it humorous and flattering.

It's the scariest thing in the world to feel like you've lost control of your mind, while still being aware of it. 

I haven't had an experience like this for 12 years. I thought I was done with these. The thing I did differently is reach out, not keep it to myself. I live and work alone and that contributes highly to the anxiety. I texted friends and confessed, I called my mom multiple times a day, I called the therapist I ditched six months ago, I told my sponsor. I had my neighbor friend come over multiple times one day. I've gone to my first in-person AA meetings and have found much comfort in being with other actual live human beings. 

Any suggestions are welcome to help with this. But I am also sharing to be accountable, and to let anyone else who may be going through something similar know you are most definitely not alone.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80813235}"

No one to talk to me, no one needs anything from me, I get to just *be*. As I've gotten older and work and life responsibilities and stress have piled on, I transitioned out of being a morning person and into more of a night owl, not waking up till the afternoon and staying out till 2 or 3 most nights.

Imagine my surprise the last several days where my eyes have popped open at 8:00 a.m. and I am ready to go. No more ""ugh, I just need another half hour and this headache will be gone"" or ""ok, I'm in my bed. That's a good start...""

I‚Äôm a women in my early 30s and for the past 4 years I‚Äôve been trying to get sober because my alcoholism has nearly killed me several times. This most recent trip to rehab taught me that I‚Äôm not going to have many more chances and I need to get serious. I‚Äôve been at a sober living facility far away from home and while there‚Äôs been ups and downs today just broke me. Or it nearly did. 
All of my close friends are either married, engaged or having kids and as someone who has desperately wanted a family (but not with just anyone, it needs to be the right person) I‚Äôve just felt so hopeless all day because of where I am right now in life. 
I feel like I‚Äôve messed up so many times I don‚Äôt deserve a chance anymore. I‚Äôm struggling and I can‚Äôt even run from these feelings into a bottle of liquor. Trying so hard not to give up but I‚Äôm close. At least today I will not drink with you all.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.89364934}"
2021-09-19 01:04:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pr1qlx/harsh_reality_of_a_breakup/,Harsh reality of a breakup,"I was with my (35m) girlfriend (34f) for almost four years now. We have a 3 year old son together. My drinking got progressively worse. I was never violent. Never dangerous. I continued to work and everything else without issue‚Ä¶ she kicked me out in July because I was being a bad example for our son. I agreed.

I continued to drink, but we still saw each other regularly, even hooked up a couple times. Then late one night I got an alert on our Nest app. (we‚Äôre co-owners of the house she and my son live in and I still visit several times a week). Through the gray video I think I saw that awkward first kiss. 

I was not ready to see that. I‚Äôd been suffering from some serious loneliness being alone in my apartment and she wasn‚Äôt responding to messages all day. I proceeded to nearly kill a fifth of vodka in a couple hours. I took my 9mm out of my safe. Loaded a magazine and pulled the slide back to chamber a round. Pulled the trigger.

*click*

Nothing. It‚Äôs a newer gun and the spring isn‚Äôt broken in yet, the round never got into the chamber. I immediately fell to the floor sobbing like a teenage girl. I drank vodka until I passed out.

The next morning I showered, made my self look the best I could and drove to see her. I wanted to talk about two things. Are we done, done? And did you kiss that other guy? I did neither, and just cried on her shoulder like an idiot and left. That was Wednesday morning.

I didn‚Äôt tell her about the gun yet. And I don‚Äôt think I will. I haven‚Äôt drank since then. And I‚Äôve been staying at their house because I‚Äôm afraid to be alone in my apartment. She‚Äôs been really busy with work and a garage sale since Wednesday so I haven‚Äôt told her that I want to talk about our relationship status or if we can be together again.

It‚Äôs now Saturday night she had a work thing at one of the local university football games. The game has been over for awhile. I know she‚Äôs getting food. I assume with the guy.

Anyway, a lot of backstory just to say the following: the anxiety of confrontation is crippling. I haven‚Äôt had a reasonable thought for three days.

But I haven‚Äôt had that drink yet.


TL;DR: not sure if my relationship is over and I‚Äôm experiencing crippling anxiety but I still haven‚Äôt had that drink since Wednesday.


Edit for update, in case anyone is interested: We talked it out. And it didn‚Äôt go as well as I had hoped. The door isn‚Äôt completely shut on the relationship, but it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúwe‚Äôll see what the future holds‚Äù. Which is honestly more than I deserve (there‚Äôs a couple other nuances to our relationship that I had to leave out). 

Thanks for those who replied and for your advice.
I‚Äôm starting some online therapy next week and in person the week after. The gun/safe will be going to her parents place. I‚Äôll be doing whatever I can during my non-therapy days to cope. I‚Äôm going to start writing letters about my daily struggles and snail mailing them to her. Hand wringing things and making little gifts for each other is something we always liked doing.

She‚Äôs willing to keep supporting me in a non-intimate role as I move forward. I didn‚Äôt ask about the other guy specifically, but I mentioned that moving on to another guy so quickly while I was going through this would hurt me a lot. I know it‚Äôs none of my business and she can do what she wants, but I had to let her know. Her response was that she won‚Äôt be dating anyone until next year at a minimum and is also focusing on herself.  So I probably misread that whole situation.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Hi All! I‚Äôm thrilled to be hosting this week and to take over from u/AlySabby12. I‚Äôm so grateful for this community. You all are what has gotten me sober. 

I‚Äôm going through some big life changes now so I‚Äôve actually had drinking in the back is my mind for the last month. Knowing that I was scheduled to host this week has kept me on track though! 

Recently I‚Äôve felt a little lost in life with everything that‚Äôs going on and I‚Äôm struggling to understand what my meaning is. I‚Äôm trying to do some things that are out of my comfort zone and to stay busy because I feel if I‚Äôm not busy then I‚Äôll go back to drinking. 

I‚Äôve joined some local meetup groups and have participated in some events. I‚Äôm starting to cook more and am taking a painting class to try something different. The class has helped meet new people with different perspectives. 

Have you taken on any new hobbies or started any new routines that help you stay sober? I look forward to hearing your replies!

Life‚Äôs not about making the most money, having a trophy job, spouse, home, or car. It‚Äôs about being a good person. Taking care of what you‚Äôve got and are responsible for the best you can. And any one at any time with any future or any past can decide to be kind, helpful, available, healthy in their little part of the world. 

We can‚Äôt always control losing a job, losing a spouse, a friend, a family member, our health, our children‚Äôs choices, our parents... But we can choose our characters. We can be honest, loving, kind, reliable and those things feel better than trophy wins. Sobriety helps with all those things.

This is mama again saying in little ways and small ways, make the world a better place, be proud of the person you are becoming or are trying to become. You have special gifts to share with your family, friends, and community. 

Glad you‚Äôre here. You belong. You are wanted. You are valued. We all need you! And it‚Äôs good to be needed. You have a place. Don‚Äôt be afraid to keep becoming all that you can be for yourself your family, friends, and community.

I‚Äôm nervous AF right now. In roughly 12.5 hours, I start the San Francisco marathon. Running a marathon has been on my bucket list since I was a kid. Never, ever, did I think I‚Äôd actually do it.

I have spent every weekend for the last 6 months doing progressively longer runs. Every Tuesday and Thursday I woke up at insane-early o‚Äôclock to do interval trainings with my running group. I have followed the training program and even learned to care about my diet. Still-I‚Äôm nervous AF.

I think the nerves might be not just for the run, but for actually attempting to accomplish a life goal-and fear of failing. 

Alcohol used to numb me to that fear. But it didn‚Äôt make me brave, *it prevented me from trying.* 

I‚Äôm over 3 years sober, and I‚Äôm not looking back. I may be scared as hell, I may have the nervous shits (TMI, but whateves), but I‚Äôm living. I‚Äôm trying. I‚Äôm going to accomplish something that I‚Äôve always wanted to do, but alcohol always distracted me from.

Not exactly sure why I‚Äôm writing this. I guess I thought it would help with the nerves if I wrote it out, and it has. So thanks for reading this far my fellow sober traveler.

So for a bit of context I have been causally having a drink or two pretty much every evening for 2 or 3 years now. I recently turned 30 and decided it had become a bad habit that has to stop. 

I had some success with reducing it so I only drank when out with my partner or some social situation (with the support of a Redditor from this sub!). I quickly learned that the key is to not have alcohol in the house. 

If it's in the house I will likely drink it. If it's not I can't üôÉ

I currently have a lot of alcohol in the house... my partner and I have started hosting weekly mini quiz nights (small numbers in light of covid restrictions) so we bought a load of alcohol and now have a stash or assorted liquors for the weekly social gathering. 

So of course here I am, slipping back into the daily habit of a G+T to celebrate the end of a day...

I have really told myself that I AM NOT drinking today. Determined to not do it. I don't need or want it so just why?

I guess I'm posting for added accountability and some support from strangers that understand the nature of it. 

But I also wanted to ask what you do when the cravings hit you? How do you handle it? Any tips or tricks that you use in particular to help until the urge passes?

81 days ago I was overweight, bloated, miserable and drunk nearly every day. Who wants to be like that?  I clearly did because I was like that for a good while before I started on this journey. 

Some improvements:

My overly itchy skin has disappeared. It was connected to drinking almost every night of the week. No more does my whole body itch when I am trying to sleep. 

Sleep quality is great. My insomnia is back but I get good quality sleep when I fall asleep and wake rested. Mornings are absolutely a blessing from the Gods now. No hangover. No more night sweats. I do have bad dreams but those are a life long thing that were exacerbated by heavy drinking.  

My really long walks have turned into slow jogging about two miles. I was a dedicated jogger/runner before all this drinking bullshit and I am determined to return to that lifestyle. My neighbors notice this return and are happy to see me back out on the road. 

Weight loss has been slow and steady after the first 40 days or so. 8 pounds down as of today. My ‚Äúfat‚Äù pants are getting loose!!  I still have evening snack attacks and those organic Costco veggie straws are my new go to snack.

I am happy with these changes. If I make it to 90 days I am going to get my chip at an AA meeting. 

If I can do this so can you. It‚Äôs not easy but given time it gets better.

That's the longest time I've ever gone this long without since I started. I haven't posted in this community for awhile and honestly that was the wrong move. Some things went wrong in my life and I was under more stress than I ever have been before. It looks like things will be okay. I was so tempted to drink during that time and even put myself in high risk situations. It was luck that I did not drink and nothing more. In truth I wanted to just to blame it on my old pal. However, actually dealing with and going through these things made me stronger, but I would have really spiraled and ruined everything if I had even a sip.  

I learned a lot though about myself and the people I actually want and need around me. 

The only guilt I have now around drinking is not stopping sooner. It's really bad sometimes. Things that could have been prevented. The part the weighs on me is the people I've hurt with it more than anything. Yeah of course, it's effected my health and definitely my mind. Like, I'm witty and smart again. Not in any way I could have been when I was drinking that's for sure. I can laugh that stuff off because I deserve it. It's more of the people who aren't in my life anymore because of my drinking. I want to tell them I've changed and I'm blah blah blah. The thing with that is I know it's just for me. I'd really just upset or bother those people. 

On the bright side those things don't have to happen anymore. That feels up to me now. I just wish I knew now when I had my first drink ever.

I hung out with really great friends who have been nothing but supportive of me quitting alcohol. They still drink but have gone out of their way to not drink around me for the last couple months. Yesterday I decided I missed the social element of standing around with a cold beer and talking to my friends so I decided to grab two N.A Heinekens and see how I'd go. 

Full disclosure I was a bit hesitant at first to even sip it as I didnt want to set off the monkey in my brain... 

But I'm glad I gave it a go. I feel as though it was a huge step forward, I slowly sipped my two drinks over the course of the afternoon while everyone else drank the hard stuff and I can honestly say for me it didnt awaken the beast but rather put it too bed. I always liked the taste of beer and it was nice to have a substitute that made me feel as though I wasn't being left out. It was also nice to realise that I really value being sober regardless of what others are doing around me. The music was wonderful and the conversation was as well.

I know it's not for everyone and I totally get that so I'm not recommending it as a replacement to cravings because honestly that's a battle within we have too face. But it did put others around me at ease. I hate being treated like an alcoholic and making others who can drink responsibly feel like they have to hide their drinks like I'm gonna bash them for a sip cause it isnt like that. Alcohol is the tool I used to cover up much deeper issues and I can honestly say I dont miss the shit. I dont miss being drunk I missed talking shit and being a part of my group. It was nice to realise that. And I wanted to share it with you guys. And the best part of all was I drove my wife home at the end of the day we got shitty take out and watched a movie and this morning i feel refreshed and ready for another day.

I‚Äôve had some mild to moderate temptations, but I‚Äôve mostly just avoided bars and people I used to drink with, and I‚Äôve been fortunate that I haven‚Äôt been in too many situations that involved anyone drinking.

But a friend of mine was unexpectedly visiting from out of town and staying with me for two nights. We used to bartend and carouse together. I went out for dinner and drinks with her and we met up with several people who I knew from my bartending days. None of them are dear friends, but all people I think of fondly, though I don‚Äôt see them very often, and I definitely haven‚Äôt sought them out since I stopped drinking. Anyway, I was so bored with all of them, and so exhausted with having to make conversation and trying to follow the rambling stories of their chaotic personal lives, and I was sitting in front of a beautiful well-lit bar well-stocked with all kinds of delicious booze, and I had (just that very yesterday afternoon) gotten my lab results from a physical which showed that I was, to my shock and good fortune, an obscenely healthy person, with completely normal liver and kidney function. God, I wanted a drink. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the harm?‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the harm in getting a little drunk and thus making all these people little less annoying?‚Äù

Well, there probably wouldn‚Äôt have been any real harm, other than my intense anxiety about having a relapse, and I thought ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt relapse if you don‚Äôt take the first drink.‚Äù (This sounds like an AA saying to me, though I haven‚Äôt been going to AA.) I thought of how much better I feel since I quit, how dramatically my mood has improved, how I‚Äôve lost weight and have more energy, how things are starting to go well for me career-wise, and how much I truly don‚Äôt want to mess any of that up, when I‚Äôm just about to hit my 6-month sobriety mark! Thought about how just about every professional would recommend that someone with ‚Äúalcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission‚Äù not take one drink. I also reminded myself how I want to experience life in a new way---how it‚Äôs important (to me) to get through a whole year, every season, every event, seeing them as a sober person, no matter how annoying or boring they may be. It‚Äôs a necessary experiment.

So, I didn‚Äôt drink last night, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt.

I have drunk daily all my adult life. Through retirement and Covid lockdown it got worse, and would almost always be 2-2.5 bottles of wine, plus maybe a few beers each day. Clearly an unsafe level of drinking.

I love this community. I am on my third reset. I have found it a bit easier each time. This time, I have been making a note of changes as I notice them.  You may recognise several or many of these. If you have noticed benefits I have not noticed, please add them in the comments. They may help others go ""Oh yes, me too"".

Even though I do not have many days yet, these are the changes I already notice in me. The 'living longer' points are to be decided over time, but I am convinced not drinking will help.

Anyway, I thought it might be fun to share my changes.

**The important stuff: living longer**

Lose weight (11 lbs / 5 kilos lost so far)

Reduce risk of cancer

Reduce risk of liver failure

Reduce blood pressure (was 162/90, now 140/82)

**The good stuff**

Taking control, not being controlled

Wake ready for the day, not hungover

Remember the whole of your evening

Able to drive, anywhere, anytime

Less lazy, more: ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get it done‚Äô

Clear headed, better thinking

More positive attitude

Less anxiety

Less problem-avoidance, more tackling issues

More active, more exercise

More agility and flexibility

Better hygiene

Going to bed knowing you will be OK tomorrow

No more tipsy/drunk phone calls when friends or family call

Have nothing to hide

Less back pain

Less knee pain

Save money

**The nice stuff**

Clothes fit better

Follow and remember TV shows / films

Read more books

Never pass out on the sofa

No guilty shopping across multiple stores

No guilty recycling

Much cheaper to eat out

No booze inventory anxiety

No booze-buying detours

The joy of a stiff turd

They constantly tell me how much better I look, how quick-witted I am again, how my sense of humor has come back with full force and how they're finally excited to spend time with me again.

My sister lives several hours away and is in college but we chat regularly.  She says that she's heard amazing things from our parents about me and that she's proud of how far I've come.  She also has told me that I helped her make reasonable choices about alcohol consumption, especially since she has similar psychiatric issues.

I was up and ready to go to breakfast with my Dad by 7:30 AM!  Had my makeup on and everything.  Then I went to the dollar store with my mom and we bought some canvases and acrylic paints to have fun with tomorrow.  I wouldn't have been able to do those things if I had been drinking yesterday.

Which happens pretty frequently these days cause my schedule is so opposite my husbands.

I know, for me at least, the biggest thing that works is just changing the habit.  Rewiring those brain synapses so after time it‚Äôs less and less likely that I‚Äôll even consider sneaking drinks cause ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do that anymore.‚Äù

All that to say, at least for the first little while, I was thinking of giving myself short term rewards.

Now, most of my milestone birthdays were long gone (18, 21, 30, etc.) so I try not to make a big deal of these less significant ones. However, you can really feel the effects of a shrinking friend group on your birthday: the lack of calls, texts, emails, well wishes. I think this was easily the lowest output, but I acted like I didn't care. I am not Walt Disney, so my birthday isn't the magical event I expect the world to do cartwheels over. 

Like many, COVID hit me hard. I didn't get it, but I was already so isolated by living alone, with few friends left in the area. I had too much free time by working from home, and my drinking escalated from a Friday or Saturday night unwind to something every 3-4 days. I spent so much time on the seesaw, and my actions became worse and worse. I was hurting people around me, saying things that seemed okay the time. I did many things completely out of character that make me cringe to even think about. The drinking would make me hypo-manic and ultimately hyper-sexual. This would lead me into bad situations with women in my life, and a desire to be wanted, touched. To feel ""good"" again. But, the next day I'd sink into a depression and wonder how if I'd lost anyone else in my life. My mental health would suffer and only get better with long periods of sobriety. My drinking behavior made me disgusted with my self.

Anyways, this particular birthday involved going out to dinner with a couple people. It felt like a couple people doing so out of obligation since I didn't really have anyone else who cared. I went home, and without thinking much of it muttered out loud ""I think this might be my last birthday."" I had know idea why I said that as I'm terrified of death and could never really harm myself. But, it was a litmus test how I felt about my life situation and how alone I felt in the world. It was actually quite alarming to think about and to even write about a year later.  I have done better since really trying harder this past April, and have put together some long periods of sobriety (30, 40 days a clip), but I still struggle at times. The couple who took me out for my birthday are moving away, and while I'm happy for them, I wonder if I'll spend this birthday alone, alone. I also feel that they've grown annoyed with my drunken behavior. I'm not violent or insane or anything, I'm actually a very friendly drunk. However, I've noticed I become very self-deprecating and over complimentary to everyone. I almost like put everyone else above me or something, and lower my own self-confidence. I'd like to put together 8+ months of sobriety coupled with some weight loss, so when I see these people again I can show them I'm doing okay. I simply can't afford to lose anymore people, as it feel like drinking strips me of respect from others, but more importantly, my own self-respect. I just want to walk away from this nightmare that drinking had lead me to, to have a brighter tomorrow. I'm very successful career wise but I often struggle with other facets of my life.  I just don't like the person I become when I drink even if others might minimize my behavior, or not be as offended as my paranoia makes me believe they are.

Anyway, today I want to really commit to it and start again and hopefully this time I will succeed and I'm writing here hoping that the feedback I will receive will give me some more strength in overcoming this..

It's been 121 days since my last drink, and it's going pretty well. Some days are harder than others, but even when I'm under the influence of *other* things, I've been 100% able to resist the temptation of alcohol.

Except, in *one* situation. My dreams. This has been a reoccurring aspect of my dreams since quitting, and has continued to bother me up to this day.

Essentially, alcohol sometimes sneakily finds its way into my dreams. It's never the centre of attention (like, I'm never at a bar or getting wasted at a party), but it sneaks in one way or another. And when I notice it I become very anxious, even when sleeping.

For example, last night I was dreaming that I was on vacation with my family at some lake. I was sitting on a dock with my dog, looking out to the water and having a peaceful sleep. Then, suddenly, I was at a family dinner. Nothing had gone wrong yet, until someone at the table turned to me and said ""hey, are you drinking?""

I got that weird half-lucid thing in dreams where something briefly knocks you back to reality. I looked down, and in my hand was an ice cold Budweiser. Suddenly, anxiety washed over me and I instantly started to feel drunk. I haven't been drunk in months at this point, but that familiar warmth and slight confusion was immediately recognizable.

So I said, ""well... it's just one beer"", and then the fake-drunk feeling got more intense. For the rest of the dream (however long it was), I wasn't thinking straight, and my actions became more and more off-putting/inappropriate. Then eventually, I woke up and briefly felt the strongest depression in a while. I really thought I had broken my streak and cracked under the pressure. Thankfully, I quickly realized it was a dream and put it behind me. But it still bothers me a little.

I never even put a drink to my lips. Just knowing that I had a beer in my hand, and my dream-self had decided it was okay to do so, was discouraging enough to thoroughly rattle me. Luckily, I think this specific dream has reaffirmed my beliefs that I *do not* need to be drinking.

Anyone else ever have dreams like this after quitting? Do they ever go away? Do you take them as positives or negatives if you have them?

Hope to clear my head and hear some perspectives from people that have been through something similar. 

I am a engineering student, and as many of us do I have partaken in my fair share of binge-drinking. Just about a year ago, I faceplanted on my way home from a bar. It resulted in two broken front-teeth, one which had to be replaced with an implant. I had contemplated going sober around this period, and for the next 7 months I was. I considered this my wake-up call, and thought I had processed and gotten a handle on my habit of not being able to stop drinking when I felt that I was getting too drunk. I swore to myself that I would never let it go out of control again in such a way. However, gradually over the last six month I let myself slip back into old habits, and with general life-stress I once again started to use alcohol to ""get away"" from it or blow off some steam.

Queue today, I woke up with extreme disappointment in myself. Last night I betrayed my resolutions, my ideals and my dignity by getting absolutely smashed. I made it home barely, but not before letting my face once again have a run in with the ground. From what I remember I was also very lucky not to go falling into a river, which probably would have resulted in my final swim. After being to the doctor it seems that I have been extremely lucky in all aspects, with nothing broken except my dignity.  

The situation has left me at a crossroads. I realize that I cannot control my drinking when I first start, and changes have to be made. With that I am trying to find the courage to stop drinking for good, but I do not know where to begin. What I did last time worked only for a period, and I have no idea what to do to instill lasting habits and changes. Any helpful tips would be greatly appreciated, thanks",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.47998852}"

Hope you had a relaxing and restful Friday evening, I certainly did! Felt so good to unwind from this past week without getting bombed and feeling lousy today. 

My roommates, on the other hand, decided to blow of some steam and hit up the town. ""Cool on you guys"" I said, but I was in chill mode yesterday and was adamant about staying in. As it turns out, it was a lousy night which included fights with girlfriends, being refused service at bars, etc. I wondered if any of that would have happened at all if they hadn't been drinking - I kind of don't think so. 

Stories like this from them remind me that I'm really not missing all that much. 

Going to hit the gym soon then probably do some light studying in the afternoon. That definitely wouldn't be the case if I got lit last night, so I think I'll stick to this for a while.

I do end with some side effect questions that I have for this community.  Thank you all for your posts because many of you helped me to make the life changing decision I made a week ago!

I'm in my late 30's, have epilepsy (although haven't had a seizure in over a decade), and have drank everyday for YEARS.  Lately, I could put down 10-15 cans of beer within 3-4hrs after work on a work night and be slightly buzzed, not even considering what damage I'd do on the weekends.  I found it a way to relax after working a stressful job and it just honestly became a normal habit.  Because of this I'd eat very late then pass out asleep, wake up in the middle of the night with heart palpitations and high anxiety not being able to go to sleep.  This obviously carried into the next day.  If it was a work day it took my brain some time to fully ""wake up"" and on weekends I'd just start drinking when I woke up which typically ended with me falling asleep early afternoon, then rinse and repeat in the late evening/early hours.  On Mondays, after heavily drinking all weekend I found myself sweating profusely and overheated getting ready in the morning, upset stomach, and don't get me started on my bowels. 

Last Saturday I woke up and started drinking.  Everything was typical but I fell asleep rather early at around 11am.  I woke up 4hrs later on the couch, wanted a beer and just thought enough was enough.  I wanted to spend the rest of the day getting sober and letting my body take a break from it all.  I also wanted to see how I'd be at my job that following Monday.  Was my job actually as stressful as I thought?  How would I function at my job if I wasn't hung over from the day/weekend prior?  These questions made me want to give it a try.  

Now it wasn't easy!!!  Sunday was tough but I made it through.  When I woke for Monday I was more refreshed than I had been in a VERY long time.  I can honestly say that my ride into work was less stressful, I wasn't sweating profusely Monday morning getting ready for work, and I just felt better.

Monday I was more alert and discovered my stress level had decreased some.  The afternoon was a  test - getting home from work and not immediately cracking open a beer.  Instead, I opened a can of pop (soda to many).  I drank more water and actually ended up eating dinner at 8 instead of 11pm.  I continued to do this throughout the remainder of the week and it got easier to do.  Mainly because I truly enjoyed a full nights rest, being more alert and responsive at work, and especially having the energy and drive to be more active!  As days passed, my wife and I noticed my behavior changed.  Not that I was an angry drunk but more social, hung out with her more, joked more....  I am just truly happy!  I also found myself getting my daily TODO list done before 5pm.  And this week, I'm not working on the weekend and instead of putting in 55-60hrs, I put in 49 (I'm a manager).

My wife drinks and she'd stay on par with me.  But now that I stopped her drinking has cut down significantly.  Everyday we'd buy 1-2 cases a beer and be back at  the store the next day.  Since I quit I think my wife went a total of 2x and the second case still has a lot left.  She will now open a beer up in front of me and apologize because she doesn't want me to get the itch, but I simply DO NOT HAVE IT!  For example, Friday nights are typically my nights with friends to drink and play video games.  And I'd put down A LOT!  So last night I was mildly worried how I'd be.  But I was completely sober, not an urge to open a beer at all, and still had fun.

I'm going to keep this up.  Part of me would love to think that I could have a beer or two at social gatherings but I know it wouldn't just stop there.  I don't want to put myself into a position where I'm back to square one.  So I'm done for good now.  Time to try to pick something else up instead, like exercising early in the morning before work!

So thank you all for your inspirational stories.  You helped me say enough was enough!

**SIDE EFFECTS:**

I've noticed some things initially and even up to now that I wanted to see if they are normal.  I'd appreciate some insight if possible.

\-  **Sleep**:  I sleep a LOT better at night, but I find myself wanting to sleep much earlier and longer than normal.  I'm used to passing out at 11pm and sleeping 4-5hrs at night (with waking up in middle of night with heart palpitations and anxiety).  But now my eyes are getting heavy around 9pm and can sleep 9-10hrs straight through the night (at least double the hours).

\-  **Eating**:  I have seen my appetite go through the roof.  I get home at 6pm and I'm starving.  Before I'd go with eating a snack during the day and dinner late at night.  Now I'm starving at lunch and dinner and want to go to bed an hour or so after dinner. 

\-  **Seizures**:  I know that people who are alcoholics are always told not to stop cold turkey or they could get seizures due to chemical imbalances of the brain.  I'm not sure that since I'm epileptic and take daily medications that could be preventing them or not.  But for how long after stopping cold turkey could you go with the possibility of still having seizures until the brain's chemicals balance out?",46,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4430761}"

Whatever, I didn‚Äôt go back and it didn‚Äôt stop me form improving myself so I don‚Äôt really care that much. One thing though is I don‚Äôt put my self in situations often where I really need to turn down drinks. However I got invited to a concert last night and figured it was two band I enjoyed and the tickets were free so why not. It‚Äôs was one of the few times I was actually nervous about not drinking.

One thing we all talk about is how we notice not nearly as many people are getting drunk as we thought when we were drinking. We notice that most people just have a few drinks and sip them. And while I totally agree with that, concert are different right? You‚Äôre there to party and people are getting hammered and doing drugs. Well I gotta I was shocked at how few people were really drinking. Sure there were people drinking, and of course there was the select few rowdy people, but it wasn‚Äôt incredibly smaller percentage than I would have guessed. There was very few people who were falling down drunk by the end of the night. People were drinking, but not drunk.

But the best part is I was actually able to just enjoy the concert. Usually when I got to a concert (and I‚Äôm not a huge concert guy so there‚Äôs not many by still) I‚Äôll have a jug of a mixed drink to chug in the parking lot to avoid paying $13 for a drink. But I‚Äôd get there, keep drinking and eventually make my way towards the front of the stage. Once there I wouldn‚Äôt want to give up my spot and I‚Äôd either start sobering up or have to pee and the wrestle with the question of do I give up my spot I worked all night to get to get some more beer or do I just stay and sober up and suffer. I‚Äôd find myself wanting the show to end so I could just get back to putting booze in me. It‚Äôd keep my from enjoying the concert. On top of that I‚Äôd usually be so drunk that I wouldn‚Äôt have the best memory of the show. But not last night. I was calm and at peace and able to enjoy the show in a way I haven‚Äôt been able to since I was in high school and couldn‚Äôt drink.

I finally went to the doctor yesterday for a physical. I was terrified because I‚Äôve been drinking a whole lot the last two years and not really taking good care of myself in general (38yo f). 

This was a new doctor and I immediately felt comfortable with her so I decided to open up about my self medicating with wine issue. I also explained I have pretty bad anxiety and I‚Äôm basically at the point where I only drink because it relieves the anxiety I have around the thoughts of drinking and the cravings that have become far too intense. 

She concluded that I need help treating my anxiety and impulse problems, so she prescribed me Wellbutrin. I actually asked her about Naltrexone because my uncle uses it and it‚Äôs worked miracles for him, but she said I don‚Äôt need that‚Äîthe Wellbutrin and Lexapro should work (Lexapro is for anxiety and Wellbutrin for impulse control. I also have an OCD).

I‚Äôm not sure how to feel about this, but I am going to try it. I‚Äôve taken these meds before and i known drinking on them is a huge no-no, so maybe they will help me cut back for that reason alone. Although, my cravings and obsessive thoughts about drinking are so intense sometimes, idk.

I decided to stop drinking at the urge of my wife 5 years ago, made it 5 months, relapsed, and then hid drinking nearly daily for four years. 

I was caught plenty of times. We had a 1 year old when I first quit and we have a 1 year old now. Life around me has not gotten less stressful, but life without drink certainly has. 

How did I do it? I think I was finally ready. I‚Äôd ‚Äútried‚Äù everything before that- a psychologist, this subreddit (good for you for whom this was enough), white knuckling it. I just kept drinking through all of it. So a year ago, I reached out to a family friend who‚Äôd been sober for 10 years. We just started talking. He was heavy into AA, sponsored people, had a family of sponsors, etc. 

To me, I had no idea what my sobriety journey would entail. It was he height of the pandemic and meetings were scarce. Talking to my sponsor and to people at those meetings helped me gain perspective, but most importantly, they actually kept me in the right headspace. Being involved in AA those early days got me where I just couldn‚Äôt get myself back to- past the first couple of weeks. 

One day at a time when I first started was so important. Those first couple weeks were rough. The one in-person meeting we had in the area was shut down, so I kept in touch with my sponsor. 

Once I hit two months, I just had so much clarity. I didn‚Äôt crave the alcohol anymore, but I hadn‚Äôt retrained my brain on literally every activity in my life that involved alcohol. I have now. 

To those of you in your earliest days, from my perspective it got so much easier. I text my sponsor from time to time, but I don‚Äôt go to AA anymore. Something clicked with the knowledge and honestly just the continued happiness of not disappointing myself or my family anymore. I didn‚Äôt need it anymore. 

What will sobriety year 2 look like? I have my mind focused on physical health and cutting soda next. I‚Äôve quit drinking, so now I feel like I can do anything

Ewan McGregor (hubba hubba) does a great job playing him and embracing the chaos that is his character. 

The book was great, and the movie is a Chef's kiss to Kubrick's masterpiece. 

SPOILER BELOW:

Dan is an alcoholic and uses AA to get clean. It's a key part of the story. Not sure why they had Ewan shave his rocking beard off when he got sober, but that's just me. LOL. The infamous bar in the Overloook (which always has booze) once again makes an appearance. My kids have been part of my journey to sobriety and when Dan is taunted, not by Lloyd at the bar, but by the ghost of his dad Jack, they actually cheered when he resisted. 

One of the lines from that scene is one I've heard before:  *Man takes a drink, the drink takes a drink, and then the drink takes a man.* Has anyone else heard that before?

Enjoying the benefits.,"I was never a binge drinker. It was more of a slow and steady thing and I noticed how I gradually craved more, and would empty my glass more rapidly as time went by. It bothered me that I could promise myself to moderate and then go on to break that promise the next day. Who is in charge here anyway, I wondered. Staying within the official drinking guidelines of 21 units was something a strived to do, as this would seem to prove that I didn‚Äôt have a problem. But I realized long ago that spending so much will-power and thinking so much about beer, was in itself a clear indication of problematic use. I loved craft beers, strong and bitter IPA‚Äôs and there were few occations that did not call for a few of those: Weekend nights of course, performing well at work, celebrating having made it halfway through a week, comforting myself after a rough day, meeting a friend. Anything really. It‚Äôs rediculous. 

At the same time I was going thorugh some emotional problems. Anxiousness, low self-esteem and just feeling out of balance, having too much of the wrong emotion in all kinds of situations. I still not sure if this was caused directly by the steady inflow of alcohol or by the self-loathing that I felt for cheating myself, but now, after a month of sobriety, those problems are pretty much gone and I‚Äôm a better person in every way. In particular, I notice that I‚Äôm a better father. I think my daughter picks up that I am more present and patient with her and she responds by being more affectionate towards me. That brings a tear to my eye. I also notice how I‚Äôm just better equipped to deal with everyday stress and I care less about the judgements of other people.

My promise to myself a month ago was to quit drinking for a year or long enough that I stop thinking about it, but now I think it‚Äôs not that important to be able to drink moderately. For 20 years drinking beers was a big part of my identity. Now I want a large part of my life to be free of alcohol. So maybe 10 years would be a more appropriate goal. Then maybe I‚Äôll have a drink again. We‚Äôll see.

Lying on the couch after work and scrolling social media, it was easy to convince myself that everyone I knew was out hitting happy hour with their friends or partner, getting ready to party. Old me would have grabbed a bottle or frantically made plans to join someone at a bar (or, let's face it, I already would have been loaded) or started swiping on Tinder because I couldn't stand being alone with my thoughts. Instead, I was honest with a loved one about feeling down. I grabbed my keys and headed to the grocery store, not for a bottle but for a pint of low-cal ice cream and some fruit. I did a HIIT workout while blasting music and then I ate too much Halo Top and watched Law and Order. It was, by old me's standards, a boring Friday night. But I feel so, so much better than I would have if I'd gotten loaded. I might have problems today (and I do, my life is far from perfect) but there's nothing that drinking won't make a hundred times worse.

Everything was fine except for my b12 levels which were low, but that was expected as it has been an ongoing issue for me even from before I started drinking. 
For those who don't know, I binge drank every weekend 8-14 shots worth a night, twice a week. Since my last binge on August 29th, I had felt pain in my middle back which I thought was kidney related. I had symptoms which resembled either a UTI, kidney infection, or kidney stones. Come to find out there is nothing abnormal with my kidneys or urine. Also blood tested me for hepatitis and I was negative.

I'm baffled. I truly believed that I had some sort of kidney damage or infection and was anxious to my stomach. Most heavy drinkers worry about their livers, but livers are incredibly resilient and can heal, kidneys on the other hand do not. Once there is damage, you will slowly progress on the chronic kidney disease scale. 
I am happy to find out that my kidneys are okay and that my liver is okay, but my back has been killing me lately. I am a 23 year old female, my back should 't be killing me like this unless I were pregnant (got pregnancy tested too, I am NOT). The pain can be described as joint pain in the lower back, and then muscle strain/discomfort in the middle back and also shoulders and shoulder blades. All this occurring after I stopped drinking. Some days are better than others, but it seems that the discomfort is more prevalent at night. 

This post isn't made to seek for medical advice, I'm not a doctor and you're not doctors, but I wanted to know if anyone else experienced this.

In the broad sense it has been great, my anger & anxiety are completely under control.  I rarely ever feel the urge to drink now, just sometimes miss getting something ""special"" like a glass of champagne when celebrating something. 

I guess right now I'm lamenting the person I lost through sobriety.  I was a gregarious,  wild person that always made everyone laugh when I was drunk. I had a very large circle of acquaintances that I regularly went to bars with.  When I got sober I avoided almost all of those people,  I only stayed in contact with the people that I had hung out with in a non bar setting,  that list was very small. I would say now I have only 3 friends, after being Mr Social/Clown.  

My sober  state is very much an introvert.  I find myself in social situations now to be quiet and very observant. I feel some what disconnected from the situation,  like I'm looking at animals in the zoo. Or that my brain is just running on a different frequency that those around me and I can't connect.  I sometimes wonder is the crazy, wild, funny person everyone liked my true self that only alcohol let me express and now being sober I'm oppressing it?

I'm at the point in my life where I've been a functional drinker for years but last saturday night I blacked out, lost my phone, and slept through both church services where I was scheduled to play music in front of a crowd. Oof.

So I made the call to stop drinking entirely. It's quite difficult, and right now my brain is at the spot where it's telling me, ""oh, you're not that bad! You don't down a handle a night, just go down to getting kind of drunk 3 times a week. That'll be fine for now, why bother doing it all at once?""

But I'm glad I came here tonight (and I get the same feeling from AA) because it's like... maybe it won't cause me any more problems this year, or next year... but functional people with good jobs and hobbies and healthy marriages generally don't spend their nights getting drunk and that's just too much of a temptation. Idk. I'm going back and forth...

I enjoy sharing, and hope my story may help at least one person. Help them to start on their own journey, or for those who may be sober a while, be an encouragement to continue. 

I first off would like to take you back to when I was an infant. I had a childhood disease called croup, which causes a build up of phlegm. I had to be hospitalised frequently for this. As a result I felt a sense of rejection, and my young mind told me my parents did not want me or love me. Then at about 4 years of age I suffered sexual abuse.  This again occurred from 14 to 17 years of age  When I turned 5 and started school I was picked on and bullied. At 14 my parents moved to a much larger town and I went from a school of 300, most of whom I knew and had a few friends, to a school of 1,200 where I knew nobody and made no friends. The bullying became much worse and far more frequent. The 2 years at this school, I learned nothing, and were 2 lost years. At 16 I left school and eventually found work with the state railway,  in the ticket office,  as a clerk. Again the bullying continued. I had to move away from home for this. After a few months I moved to a boarding house. Most there were grown men. Again I was bullied. I was a very fragile, shy, introverted boy in a big man's world. 

Soon after at 17 years of age, some men were going for some drinks one night. They invited me, possibly more as a bit of fun, as much as anything. I was given a large 15 ounce glass of beer. I drank that straight down. My immediate thought, I have found the elixer of life. I was given a second and then my fifth glass. By now I was very intoxicated and went into a blackout. I sat on the floor and had a sixth glass. 

I enjoyed the blackout, and this became par for the course for me in all but one or two drinking sessions for me  I found I bloated up on beer and discovered spirits and wines  I soon began drinking pure spirits. The amount I drank, and the frequency escalated very fast. I was soon drinking 60 to 80 nips of spirits a night, on 5 to 7 nights a week. I suffered very bad hangovers, vomiting for several hours, and hardly able to get out of bed  I missed many days at work. 

Then came court appearances. Mostly minor things, but soon came more serious charges. 

A man I had worked with for some time, was being transferred back to the city. They had a send off at a club. Here I was introduced to poker machines. This was the beginning of 47 years of gambling. ( Another story in itself )

After a time I was given a transfer 120 miles away. Looking back I think the Station Master wanted to get rid of his problem, myself. On the Friday afternoon some of the staff ask if I was comming for a drink. Oh no I stated, I don't drink. 2 weeks latter king alcohol won the day. Many said I thought you don't drink. You know the result. 

My gambling escalated as did my drinking. Being desperate for money, and dealing with large sums of money, I would lie, cheat and steal, insane amounts. In 12 moths, I began with 8 K in the bank, earning 500 to 600 a fortnight, plus what I stole. I end the 12 months with nothing, and 2 credit cards with 3 K each.  

Then the money I stole caught up with me. Before my court appearance came my only drink driving charge. I drank for 17 years and drove a car almost every night  Some 6,000 nights. I faced 20 counts of, Larceny as a servant, and a high range drink driving charge. I was given a $2,000 fine, plus a fine for drink driving, and a 2 year good behaviour bond. 

The job was gone, as was my drivers licence for 6 months. You may think this would be my rockbottom.  Far from it, I was only half way through my 17 years of drinking. 

A family I knew from the church I attended learned of my situation. They telephoned my parents, which was a relief, I must say. 

My brother and sister in law contacted me and invited me to come to them interstate. I borrowed $20 for a bus fare out of town. I later repaid this. 

Latter my brother and a friend took me down to get my car and caravan. 

I struggled to find work and really almost gave up on life. If I found employment it quickly went, either directly or indirectly from alcohol. I had to be almost permantly intoxicated. While with my brother I went to my first AA meeting, but my drinking continued. 

After 18 moths I moved to the city, where I still am. I went to AA on and off, but got no amount of sober time  . I reached a point where I thought I would die, and almost welcomed the day. But it can be so very dark before the storm passes. 

I had maybe 5 moths of sobriety and I met a lady from Alanon, after a failed relationship with another alcoholic. A few months latter we were to marry. All was going well  I had a job cleaning in the city, my wife was working as a nurse, in a nursing home. She dropped me at the train, to go to work on afternoon shift. All seemed like any other day. It was 22nd December 1989. I arrived at work and the boss said I could celebrate Christmas with one or two drinks and come and start work. In Australia Christmas is a big drinking occasion.  I never did start work that day, or the next. The boss was depending on me, as it was busy with shoppers and a lot of work to do. I have a fuzzy recollection of being with a woman I worked with, drinking. I also have some recall of ringing home in the wee hours of the morning, and talking to my stepdaughter. The next full recall I have is comming to on Central Railway Station. I worked out where I was, and what had happened. 

I caught the train home, then walked 20 minuits or so home. Walked inside, was greeted by my not too happy wife. Her only words, what a lovely Christmas Presant. She walked out of the room and left me with my thoughts. I was hurting too much. Alcohol had me beat. I was done with drinking, I returned to AA. I ask for help. My recover has been a slow but steady one. I have not always gone to meetings, however today AA is a huge part of my recovery. I am continuing to work the steps, to the best of my ability. I have a home group. I am a very active member, both with my group, and other areas of AA. I do meetings most days, either face to face, or online. 

Due to other addictions, our marriage was not all smooth going. 4 years ago my dear wife, who I loved, was taken with a heart attack.  

I am now retired, living in a nice granny flat, and could not ask for more. I have my day to day needs met. Perhaps not my wants, but I do my needs  

I am 3 years and 15 days free of gambling, and 31 years and 9 months free of alcohol and all illicit mind altering substances. 

If I can do this, you too can. So how about we all get another 24 hours under our belts. 

If there is one message I was to give, the one suggestion,  it would be, Remain sober for one day. I can do anything for one day, that would apall me to do for the rest of my life. 

Just for today I will be sober with you. Love to all. 

Your friend Sober John.

Now, at the wonderful age of 3, a lot of this is unfortunately part of the package. But it was something more - a vulnerable rage pouring out of her. She was hurting. She has been hurting. And the cause was me. 

Alcohol gives me the out to dissociate and isolate. To shut myself off and wrap myself in numbness. I totally disconnected and put mommying on auto pilot. Completely oblivious - thinking she‚Äôs too young to even be aware. But she was. 

The length of time to undo the damage only gets longer and longer. Rebuilding trust, even with a 3 year old, is no small feat. And in all honesty, I don‚Äôt deserve the grace she has shown me.

Nothing really traumatic happened. It‚Äôs just a slippery slope that you don‚Äôt see coming. I drank 20-30 beers throughout the day. I worked (from home, never drove anywhere), maintained my family life, but was slowly falling apart inside. My liver function was horrible, I would go days without drinking water, just beer. I would be so sick in the morning but immediately went to the fridge to have a morning beer and it just continued throughout the day. Last May I told my wife I just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore, I hated myself. I got a ride to a hospital and then went through about a 5-6 hour ‚Äòdetox‚Äô there. It was absolutely horrible for about a month. But I made it through, I started swimming everyday and working out and even attended counseling for awhile. I made it to Christmas and of course started drinking again. I felt totally in control, but quickly realized I can‚Äôt just drink like other people. I would start sneaking beers and felt the withdrawals coming on. I quit again January 31st, 2021 and have been sober to this day! I have lost 80 pounds going from 240 to 160. I feel great physically! My blood work is perfect and I can do so much more now. Mentally, I don‚Äôt really feel like drinking anymore. Of course I do miss the feeling, and have been thinking about drinking. I know I can‚Äôt and feel the strength to not drink. Unfortunately, I have changed so much. I was very outgoing and ‚Äòhappy‚Äô when I was drinking. I was witty and I felt people really enjoyed my company. Now I‚Äôm just quiet, really reserved, and I feel like I‚Äôve lost my personality. Has anyone else had this feeling? I‚Äôm just grouchy all the time unless I‚Äôm alone and quiet. I don‚Äôt know how to change it, when I try and be outgoing and funny it‚Äôs almost excruciating.

I am a merchant mariner, which means I work on ships as a civilian. Sailors and alcohol just go together, don't they? Anyway, last February, I had to have surgery and of course, I couldn't drink. The previous month, I drank beer every day and was so frustrated because I just. couldn't. stop. The guilt and disgust I felt was profound; I had been like that for ten years and was getting worse every year. The surgery helped put the plug in the jug; I was in too much pain to drink, and on some heavy duty drugs besides. It helped me hit the reset button. I joined a 30-day pledge to drink and found this wonderfully supportive subreddit. I did pretty good until my best friend visited, but I knew that was coming. I went to my ship in April, and curiously, I have no problem not drinking when I'm at sea. But when we pull into port.....whoa, buddy. Well, Covid really shut down our liberty in port; the Navy called it Gangway up. The Captain would be allowed to pitch a tent on the pier and have coolers of beer out there, accessable after 6 pm. We'd spend 30-36 days at sea. It was rough, especially with no liberty. During the last inport, a stress-and-alcohol-fueled fight broke out. It happens.

Anyway, I realized I want more out of life than what alcohol was giving me. In February, after a few weeks sober, I realized just how much of my life was passing me by, and just how much of my anxiety was caused by my drinking. I realized I had to stop blaming my husband for getting sick (he's on oxygen, but doing surprisingly well), and I had to take control back and responsibility for my actions and my life.

So I am. I got home from my 4-month tour on August 29, and drank every day until September 11. My birthday is the 10th, and I planned it that way. On September 11, I drank my last bottle of Stella and haven't drank since. I've been tempted. But I remember how much of my life I gave up to alcohol, and frankly, fuck that. This morning, I sat down and wrote out some daily goals for myself: read something, learn something, exercise, meditate, go outside and work and play (e.g., power washing and playing in the pool), enjoy something (paint, photography, draw, and I know it sounds stupid, but I REALLY want to learn to make friendship bracelets!), and finally get my ass on my bicycle!

I want to thank you ALL for your stories and your honesty. I can't thank you enough. Reading your struggles, your successes, your failures, has helped me to understand the insidiousness of alcohol.

I still use cannabis, but cannabis has much less of a negative impact on my life than alcohol does. I do want to give that up as well eventually though.

Now, I've been having a lot of thoughts like, ""what if I could drink in moderation?"" or ""Imagine how awesome it would be if I could actually drink?"", but I try to remind myself, it's impossible, so just stop thinking about it.

This week was our first ""full"" week back (not counting labor day holiday week or first week that started mid week). Traditionally, the Friday of our first full week is a big hit the bar day, inviting new teachers out and all that. I'm usually the guy who gets that ball rolling of course. This year I thought I could still organize an afternoon out, so I sent out the text invites and mentally prepared myself to drink non-alcoholic bevs today. In addition, had plans to go to a friend's house later in the day to hang out.

This was a typical Friday for many years. Out after work for 3 or 4 hours. 7 or 8 double ipas later either driving to a friend's house or maybe, if it was a good day, leaving my car and taking an Uber. The promise to my wife of being home by dinner out the window at this point. You know the rest...5 or 6 more double ipas at my friends house paired with a bunch of weed and I'm passed out on their couch (usually by 10 or 11). 

I started to really romanticize this whole scenario over the past 48 hours since I sent out the text invite. I'm not going to lie...this sober life has been boring at times and I started to feel like I really deserved a night that was like the old ones. I started the bargaining I do in my head: ""I can start only drinking on Fridays"" ""I can stick to only beer and no hard liquor"" ""I'll drink light beer instead of double ipas"". 

These are all lies I tell myself. Even if tonight was a night I was able to keep in moderation, by next weekend I would be making the same poor decisions that I always have. 

I kept telling myself I could just drink non alcoholic beer and be OK, but realized that I'm too vulnerable right now. I canceled everything. Afternoon plans, evening plans, everything. And I told people why, too, because I don't want to be ashamed about who I am. 

I've been really aggravated all afternoon that I canceled. Really struggling with the balance of what's good for me and what's good for me socially.  Allowing the social aspect to outweigh the negatives. So I started reading posts here and comment chains.

I quit drinking last monday and since then, I‚Äôve been experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I haven‚Äôt splept for days, I‚Äôm sweating and hot and feel very depressed and anxious. I‚Äôve been reading this subreddit for a while now and i feel it might me a good support. The gp was very understanding luckily, as he is familiar with all that has happened in my life over the last several years.

In the last 3 years, my daughter has had cancer twice. Covid happened during this, so we lived in isolation in order to protect her from covid during intensive chemo treatments. Then, my father in law got cancer as well. My husband was able to keep working luckily, and I took it upon me to keep our whole family on their feet. The appointments, the frequent hospital stays, the sudden homeschooling of my son, the caring for a very sick child at home. And after all this had settled a little, lockdown number 2 happened. 

My daughter is healing well, luckily, but my husband developed a herniated disc in his back, so was incapable of doing anything besides laying in bed for months. On top of that, the pain made him angry and controlling, raising massive levels of tension in our house. So, even more was put on my shoulders. I soldiered on and was functioning wonderfully well, actually. I had an enormous drive to keep things together, keep spirits up, fought for the right help for my daughter and traumatised son at school. Then, after half a year, my husband fell into a burnout.  My father got cancer as well, which could luckily be treated quickly.

I was still going, keeping things together within our family and i finally managed to get my husband to seek the right help. I can‚Äôt express what a massive relief that was. He‚Äôs on the right medication,slowly returning him to the lovable person he‚Äôs always been and once again, slowly but surely, able to support me with stuff.

So‚Ä¶.things are looking better now, right? Well, yes‚Ä¶. But. 

What kept me and my adhd brain going all this time, was wine, when finally the day was done. It helped calm down my racing brain. It helped numb all the sadness, the fears and horrible experiences. It helped me fall asleep. The next day, i would be up and ready to take on all the challenges thrown at me for another day, with my reward at night waiting for me. But, now that things are looking up, I made the decision to stop drinking.  I have my own health to consider. The last thing i want is to continue this downward spiral.

I had such a good talk with my gp. He prescribed medication to ease my restlessness and anxiety for the next few days. These are supposed to be the hardest withdrawal days. Then, we will see what path to take. I am reassured by the many options that there are.

I'm keeping that thought in mind today and telling myself I deserve to live this great life I've built in sobriety. I'm starting to feel gratitude instead of guilt one day at a time üëÜ

Every time I think I am starting to feel ok, and maybe even a little happy, I feel like life is waving misery and anxiety in my face. Today  I felt like I was not getting the respect or consideration I deserved, and I snapped at a coworker. I'm the type of person that goes above and beyond to the best of my ability for people I care about, but it seems like I'm always left behind or made the laughing stock, or just forgotten. I was invited to a friend's lunch event by ANOTHER friend (not the one who was hosting), and I said I wasn't sure I wanted to come since I didn't really get the invite and I wouldn't want to intrude on plans that they had made. I guess in my mind I might have been a bit dry or snappy. But I guess I was just hurt. These people always invite me to things last minute almost because they know I will say I cannot make it since I, at that point, probably have other plans. Anyways, I felt immediate guilt for snapping and I texted to apologize. Now my anxiety is through the roof trying to think of and anticipate what they must be thinking of me, or if they're mad, or if I am a shitty human being that doesn't deserve peace or happiness or the company of friends or to have people like me. My brain doesn't give me a break. I'm just sad. Yesterday was hard but I stayed sober. But gosh, why can't I seem to catch a break?

I live in a big city and Friday and Saturday nights are always bar nights for me and my friend group. I let them know this week what my plan was and they respected it but it's not like they are going to change up the ritual, so I'll probably end up alone on them for a bit. I just know these weekends are going to be full of FOMO for a while. I usually go to the gym when I need to get out of my head but I know I can't be there all night. I am just wondering what things you might recommend for someone in my position who isn't used to tame weekends in a loud city.

Life has not been peachy since I quit drinking. I mean before July I had a job, I was renting a room, I had money in my account, even had an Ebike! I was set! I was also drinking straight vodka every single day and fighting catastrophic hangovers every morning. Only thing I ever used the bike for was going to work and getting booze anyway. I was dying. But now everything's the opposite. I'm in a homeless shelter, no money, no job, no bike,in an unfamiliar town. But also no booze. Even though everything seems messed up right now, it's kinda awesome. Life can become a whole lot less complicated when booze is no longer around. No one else here at the shelter is committed to being sober, except for maybe 2 people. I see people drinking and doing drugs every single day, I get offered things like meth and speed and of course booze but its always a No and I think most people here are starting to get it. Did you guys know that crack was still a thing? And so much drama, I'm not used to being around so many people, the fights, the drug abuse...its pretty jarring. A lot of people are here because of mental illness as well. These people need help but a lot of them don't want it and are fine living the way they are, its incredibly sad. I see a way out for myself, not many people here do. It must be exhausting for them.

And theft here is way too common. I've had nearly everything stolen, even my fucking clothes when I first came here. Now I have no money, and I'm having to beg to get some damn soap and shampoo, toothpaste etc. But whatever. I've been using the hand soap in the bathroom to clean myself. Its ghetto and my skin is dry and itchy but it works. 


Someone said in another one of my posts that they can take everything from me but my sobriety, and I keep reminding myself that I'm doing the right thing. With time I'll be back at work, I'll get out of this place and start working on my dreams...traveling, a new computer(I used to build them), writing a book. But most importantly I'm finding more and more about my real self, and I'm liking what I see. Thank you guys for the love and support, IWNDWYT.",21,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.73781925}"

I don't know how far exactly I was when this story starts but in my app it was probably in the low 100s or 110s. IDK. Before that I was the type of guy who would get off work at 5 and drink non-stop until passing out in bed. Never got violent or anything but I would get slurring-your-words drunk every single night.

   I started therapy about 2 years ago to help with some grief and eventually it turned to working towards my drinking. Right when I stopped drinking he referred me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder / Manic Depressive Disorder.

  I've been dating my girlfriend for about 5 years now and we've lived together for 4 years. Honestly I feel like marraige etc was just a matter of time for her.

   Anyways, I give you all that info as background to my issue. A couple weeks ago I think I was having a manic episode. I was delirious, but super high energy, and I stayed up literally all night unable to sleep. I've noticed that these episodes have become much more common since I stopped drowning myself with sedatives (booze) every single night.

   To make this worse, I'm probably also a closeted sex/porn/masturbation addict. I feel a lot of the same shame, guilt, and ""why can't I stop"" type feelings that I did with alcohol. I haven't talked much to my therapist about this one because its substantially more embarrassing and less 'cool' than a drinking problem. There's goofy stories about Ulysses Grant and his whiskey, and guys like Ernest Hemingway and Edgar Allan Poe have made the angsty alcoholic author a trope. There's no beloved famous people out there who's main vice that they jerk off a lot.

  I actually did start talking to my therapist about this issue too, two weeks ago. For some reason though that didn't help, if anything it made me lash out sexually more. I was masturbating and just not feeling anything. I started digging through my desk for lubricant (I normally don't bother, but I just wanted something more exciting). I found an oldp condom in my desk. I was having a fantasy about seeing a sex worker (based on the porn I was watching) and so I put the condom in my wallet. I wound up finishing myself and not actually going. But I forgot about the condom.

   Anyways this all came to a head this week. I dropped my wallet in front of my live-in-girlfriend and she flipped out. I can tell this hurt her deeply, and it wasn't my intention. I told her it was just a fantasy and that I would never actually cheat on her and I think she believes me. I didn't tell her that I was thinking about seeing sex workers though, I just told her a generic story about fantasizing about girls that I never actually got with. I'm not sure if that was better or worse though because she seems deeply hurt that I would masturbate thinking about other women. She told me it was one thing to do it thinking about a porn star or a celebrity, but that people I knew were a whole different thing.

Now she's staying with a friend this week and has said she 'needed space'. She hasn't said a word to me. This is so fucked. I don't know what to do. I know drinking won't help me here, but honestly I don't know if there's anything that CAN help me. I don't wanna lose her over some stupid jerk off fantasy.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7280996}"

I can't believe how much this book has changed my views on alcohol. I'm reading the book and as each chapter goes past i'm literally agreeing with everything. The biggest thing that is different to past time i've been sober is that feeling of 'i'm missing out by not drinking'. That has totally gone! I realise I am 1 million times better off being sober, conscious and with it. 

Alcohol is a drug which I am addicted to, but I do not need 'will power' to beat it. I just need to accept it for what it is. An addictive substance that I am way better off without.

One thing thats changed for me is, i realise that when i was drinking, i was getting 0 pleasure out of it. Like 0. The only emotion close to pleasure was 'relief' when i could have that first drink of the morning/day and kill those feelings of withdrawal. After the first few drinks it was always a steady decline with very few highs and a lot of lows.

I really recognised my own experience with this. when i broke my 7 month streak back in 2013 my first drink gave me no pleasure. i thought i was genuinly going to enjoy it but that first night... nothing. Just sad. I wasn't easing any anxiety caused by withdrawel, so when i drank it gave me no relief and nothing close to the feeling of pleasure.

This book cost me ¬£5 from an online retailer and i highly recommend it. not only will it have saved me probably tens of thosands (im still young!) of pounds by the time i'm done here it's actually going to enable me to enjoy more of my life. I just feel so much better than I did less than a month ago.

Then a friend came over to visit and had a bottle of wine with her, and I decided a glass wouldn't hurt.

To be honest, it's only reinforced the fact that I don't like doing it. I was a lot happier and more present when I was sober for those two weeks, and I was - above all - proud of myself instead of dealing with the inevitable shame that comes from knowing you drank too much. I'm upset with myself that I fell off the wagon, but I'm trying to look at it as a journey that I can continue on, even though I went off track this week.

Here is what I've learned so far

Alcoholism is not a death sentence, it's an illness
Relapsing is not a bad thing, it taught me about resilience, hope, strength
Shame and guilt are not the same thing
I am not alone and when I think I am, I reach out for help
Insomnia is a normal human response to stress of daily life
Sobriety is my priority, my responsibility, and no one and nothing can make me drink
Sobriety is A LOT of work, WORTH every painful realization
Healing is slow at times, change is good


I can list a million things that are better now. Finding this out for myself has been Life Changing. Though life is not easier,   the quality of my life is better. I've been working on myself, not thinking about it but doing it. Taking action instead of thinking about it.

I am learning to live everyday, remembering the good times, dealing with the bad times alcohol free, and realizing when I wake up that I have a purpose and was not a mistake.

It is a good feeling to know that I get redemption for all of the harm I caused myself and others, in that I now take out my own trash, and recycling old habits into new, healthier habits is the best way to live life today. 

Thank you for reading this

Whenever I was planning my weekend, I always made sure to plan around my drinking. I have gone to work still intoxicated because I couldn't stop after just one or two at a party. 

Yesterday we went to Costco and seeing all those beers and bottles of wine and not buying any was a real obstacle, we would usually spend at least $100 on booze each time.

For the better part of the past 20 years I have had multiple drinks an day.  I saw it come to a head this past weekend for me when I purchased a 750 of Bourbon and on Monday after work I went to pour myself a drink and the bottle was empty enough that I couldn't make the drink I wanted.  I woke up Tuesday morning and decided I needed to make a change.  


A typical week day for me would be get home and grab a beer from the beer fridge in the garage before I even walked in the door.  I would then proceed to what can only be described as binge for the rest of the evening.  I would have 4-5 ""craft"" beers and 2-3 double old fashioneds a night.  I was noticing more and more blackouts and less and less memory of the night before.  There were hours a night I didn't remember. Yet, each morning I would wake up and go to work and shake it off on my way.  


I am currently having success in my career and other aspects of my personal life but the part that matters the most, my family, I am giving them nothing but the worst of me.  My personality changes after a couple of drinks, I lose my patience, I lose my understanding, basically I lose caring. This has to stop.  


Since then I have suppressed the urge long enough when I get home to wait until around 9 or 9:30 to grab a beer, and I haven't finished any of them.  When my wife would leave the house at night that was usually my time to cram them in and I would be drunk by the time she got home.  She left to go grab dinner and I found my immediate urge to get up and grab a drink, I fought that urge hard and the sense of relief when she got home and I didn't have anything was amazing.  Later last night I opened a bomber of a big barrel aged stout fully with the intention of finishing it (2.5 beers usually), I barely finished the glass I poured before deciding it was time for bed.  


I know this is going to be a long and challenging road, and I want to try to come to a relationship with my drinking and I also know that cold turkey is not something that will end well for me or anyone in my life so I am hoping these steps will be the first on my long journey.

I didn't expect this post to get so much attention.  Thank you and thank you to all of you who reading and replying to your comments made it so much easier to stay sober last night.  üôèüèª

Good Morning! 

So I'll get right to the point. I have tried to get sober multiple times in the past two years but this time I'm doing okay and ACTUALLY taking it one day at a time so here's what has worked for me. 

1. One day at a time. Literally.  It's easy to get caught up in counting days, or thinking about future days. I still catch myself doing this, but I remind myself that I'm focused on my sobriety today and only today. Tomorrow will come and I will focus on my sobriety tomorrow.  I don't think about the weekend before I actually gets here (at least in terms of drinking). I heard this old timer on recovery elevator say ""whoever wakes up the earliest has the most time cause this is a one day at a time thing"". 

2. I make to-do lists for the weekend.  If you are like me when you drink you don't do anything but sit on the couch and eventually eat at the end of the night. So for the weekend I make a list of things I really want to get done and I DO them! If the thought creeps up.... I look at my list and just keep busy

3. Exercise.  I walk my dog alot. I go to the gym 6 days a week and sometimes I go twice just to do some light cycling to keep my mind and body busy.

4. Journaling. I write about my day. Typically I write everyday, but sometimes I miss a day. I write about what I'm grateful for. About why I'm sober. About how much better I'm feeling.....even on a bad day. 

5. Healthy and REGULAR meals. I eat 3 times a day with two snacks. And they are healthy meals. A big part of my drinking was not eating all day and getting drunk and then eating out late at night. Now, I eat healthy and regularly.

6. I saved the best for last because it's how all this other stuff comes together.  ROUTINE! I know it seems mundane but I stick with the same routine 6 days a week. Except Sunday where I turn off my alarm. I wake up at the same time. Eat around the same times and Typically walk my dog around the same time.

It took about 3 weeks for this happen last time and it's happened in 5 days. I wonder if my anti-depressants are having an effect on the recovery process. The last time I was sober I wasn't on anti-depressants.

To all of you who are recovering or otherwise, carry on - keep going, don't give up. There is a life beyond the poison, beyond the disgusting, vile influence of a substance that, if it was created today, would be whole-heartedly illegal.

I had many failed attempts to quit, i always relapse.

I also found that breaking the association between alcohol and activities I love doing is very helpful.

During this 23 days, I've managed to play music while sober, swimming with friends without having 20 beers on the beach like i used to do before, even going out for dinner while everyone is drinking but Im good with sparkling water. It's not easy I still feel the urge to drink, it is really hard to resist, but it's not impossible. 

It is only 23 days and i can feel the benefits of staying sober, I sleep better, eat better,I'm more focused, energetic, and optimistic, my mental and physical health improved, no more hangovers, anxiety or guilt no more digestive system issues! Even my memory is improving.

So I think for the first time, I can actually see that my choice is life or death, like it's that serious. I'm choosing life and will forever more look at booze as nothing but something that will kill me if I drink it anymore. So I'm done.

But there's a little more to it. I got resources in the ER to go to local support groups. The doc and the social worker said almost no one overcomes addictions alone - they need a support group.

Within the past few years he has started trying to reconnect with us. Tonight he came over to my place for dinner. I live with an older brother and invited my sister as well. So the 4 of us have a nice meal and shoot the shit for a bit. After we clear tge table, M goes out to smoke, older brother and I put leftovers away and sis stands by the door talking to M. I notice the conversation starts getting heated about something to do with our mom. Big bro and I listen for a moment before being brought in.

What happened was M wrote a letter he later gave to mom in attempt to express his feelings towards her. I haven't read it yet but he told us the gist of it. Basically he completely blames her for the way he is. He gave it to her knowing she would be devastated but claims he didn't intend to hurt her. Worth noting that big bro, sis, and I all say he fucked up with this letter and his mentality about mom is wrong. I listened and processed for a bit before giving my two cents. 

I took to what I know worked for me to fix my relationship with my other family members. That is the 12 steps, though I never really did 11 and 12. Just take the alcohol part out and you got a 12 step general healing process. I suggested that he is going about his healing the wrong way and should maybe try applying the 12 steps, or even up to 10 like I did. 

Now I'm leaving the rest up to him. I don't know what will become of his relationship with any of us because that depends on what he does. I do believe him when he said he's trying to heal. He just fucked up this time. And if he is unable to let go of this resentment towards our mom, then I don't know if I even want a relationship with him again.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.60243005}"

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

2021-09-16 23:42:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ppsm6n/one_month_sober/,One Month Sober,"August 16th was the last time I had a drink. My go-to since I was in college was the infamous Four Loko. I'd have three on work nights, and basically as many as possible if I were to be off the next day. I had a BAC calculator so I could be drunk until literally the hour I needed to get ready for work. Upon getting off work, I'd make my daily stop at the corner store to pick up my ""friends"". It's bad when the longtime clerk is urging you to slow down.

By August 19th, I was admitted to the local Emergency Department and transported from there to a regional hospital for my withdrawals. By August 21st, I found myself outside of that hospital, roaming the streets of Fort Worth, thinking I was in California. I was in the grips of a combination of DTs, alcoholic hallucinosis and who knows what else. I hadn't touched a drink in four days and I was at the lowest of lows. 

By the grace of a power higher than myself, my brother was able to locate me in the middle of the night and had the wits about him to take me to the county hospital and wait there until the ICU staff could calm me down enough to finally fall asleep (thank goodness there was an ICU bed... COVID is exploding out here). I was totally delusional by this point. I thought my brother had picked me up in Los Angeles to take me to a concert (which turns out was the hospital). I wouldn't fully realize the truth of the situation until much later.

After about a week, I was finally released from the hospital. I've been checking in here regularly and participating in other online alcoholic forums and the like since my release from the hospital. Being a month into sobriety after such a traumatic set of circumstances has so far really changed my life. I have no desire or cravings to drink whatsoever. I'm not sure if that will last forever, but I'm extremely serious about my sobriety. All that I have learned about this chronic disease has taught me that I never want just one drink, that alcohol makes me anxious and tries to kill me, that I cannot control what happens when I start drinking, and that it is easier to stay sober than to get sober. 

If you were to ask me on the morning of August 16th if I would ever quit alcohol entirely, my honest answer would be that I couldn't. Now that I've stopped, I never want to try the stuff again. I'm powerless over alcohol. It won and I'm out of the fight. Now I wake up with a clear mind and no regrets about what I may have said or done the night before. I explore more, do more around the house, exercise more, and have a more positive outlook on life. I can't do this alone. My supportive family and friends, along with forums like this, help me everyday.

My dad passed away from alcoholism earlier this year.  Was a wake up call for me, even though I used it to cope shortly afterwards. It became clear to me that it wasn‚Äôt doing me any favors. Might sound cheesy but I feel like he has a huge part in me wanting to give up this toxic habit. It‚Äôs been the most difficult experience of my life but is such a clear cut example of what this terrible substance can do. How can I partake in something that took my dad from me? I felt a lot of guilt and shame whenever I would drink after he passed. Then drank again to quench that anxiety. Which in then exacerbated it. For someone who prides themselves on being logical, this is the exact opposite. 

Thankfully I‚Äôm learning this is my new normal. However, my anxiety is out of control today. I made a small mistake at work earlier but for some reason, I‚Äôve been ruminating on it and being overly paranoid about everything I do because I think I‚Äôll mess up again. I think it‚Äôs because I work for a very reputable company and suffer from imposter syndrome. I apologize too much. I feel like sometimes I apologize for just existing. It‚Äôs pathetic. But today I‚Äôm really craving the temporary numbness a bottle of wine would bring. Except it always followed by more anxiety. Im just too much in my mind today.

2021-09-16 20:09:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pppama/a_saturday_share_meta_analysis/,A Saturday Share Meta Analysis,"In scientific literature, a meta analysis is a collection and analysis of similar studies. I think we have a deserving collection of such ""studies"" on SD.

Early this year I read every single Saturday Share (I had a lot of time on my hands, okay?) in the archive. This is hyperlinked in the sidebar if you've never noticed it; however, I don't know what it looks like on mobile because I only use reddit from desktop.

The Saturday Shares are my favourite featured post on SD, though I love the daily check in too. I wanted to share some themes I came across in the large volume of knowledge, shared stories and wisdom. Most of said themes are present in the sum of the many daily posts in SD but the Saturday Shares are often more in depth which I think adds nuance to the learning experience. Feel free to share more of your own in the comments

My short list:

1. There are truly MANY different paths to sobriety. The backstories behind people's drinking run the gamut and no single experience encompasses every person's drinking story. The more ""gray area drinkers"" have unique experiences as well as the people that hit a more stereotypical rock bottom. Poke around the Saturday Shares and you're bound to find a story that resonates with you.
2. The backsliding. It's unbelievably common to slip, lapse, relapse, fuck up, whatever you want to call it. I see a lot of posts on here of people beating themselves up for drinking again. As I understand it from reading the old timers' posts, this can happen to anyone. I've been through it myself and I would urge self-compassion to anyone stuck in the drink-hangover-sober-lizardbraintricksyou-drink-shame spiral. It seems like a lot of the people who post Saturday Shares mention some form of self compassion as a tool for maintaining sobriety.
3. **This last one is what I would consider a unique theme compared to the overall trend among the daily posts. I don't know if this is a coincidence or not, but I have a suspicion that there is some correlation here.** This is really the reason that I wrote all of this, and I would love to hear some discussion/debate on it. *Many of the badges of Saturday Share-ers from years back would indicate that they found long-term sobriety very close to the time that they posted their share.* I don't know if the decision to write your whole drinking story down in one shot is correlated with putting the bottle down once and for all. Based on the sample size of our SS collection (I don't know the true demographics of this sub) I would guess that the two occurrences are at least partially correlated. Maybe the act of writing an SS is akin to the spirit of service that AA promotes as beneficial to maintaining sobriety?

I'm not saying that everyone here should do as I did and read every SS. I did so during a period of seasonal depression where my screen time was WAY up for no good reason. Luckily it was a minorly productive (marginally more so than binging youtube) use of my time and now that I had some time to reflect on it I wanted to pass on a tiny portion of the condensed gospel of r/stopdrinking.

P.S. I haven't done a Saturday Share myself despite my love of reading them. But I am strongly considering it, and probably have to put my money where my mouth is now that I wrote this post. Not that the label matters but during my drinking days I would have likely fallen into the category of long periods of gray area drinking with occasional periods of high risk alcohol misuse, most notable of which was my last month of drinking. I found the inspiration to quit in an unlikely place, but I'll save that for my future Saturday Share.",11,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5125891}"

Thank you, community, for existing, and for helping me to feel less crazy and alone in my drinking / quitting / self-loathing / determination.

I have had so many Day Ones it is mind-boggling. I know I can do sobriety, I havr done it, and I prefer it to being sick...but my circumstances are so awful. I have been rather stuck in a dysfunctional, broken, terrible relationship for a very long time, and a certain level of financial dependence has made that so. Recently it became violent (on his end) and I had to tell him to move out, no matter what. I miraculously found a decent-paying job around the same time, so I think I can afford to do this on my own.

He is living in this small apartment with me until the end of Sept, when he is moving into his own place across town. It is so hard to be civil, to awkwardly avoid each other in this little one-bedroom place, to pretend the other person isn't there. And he has been sleeping on the couch for a very long time; we have had sex maybe half a dozen times in the past two years. My fury and resentment of him--for so many things--is causing me to self-medicate and cope with drinking at the end of each day. I hate it, it's killing my mornings, and I will do a Day One this weekend...which will be tough, because all he has is a job. No friends, no family, he is always fucking HERE on weekends. I just want him gone, I have never been sicker in my life than I have been with him, I pray he doesn't pull some antic before month's end.

He doesn't drink, but he does smoke strong-ass weed, and he has myriad mental health issues that he has never addressed. He was put on antipsychotic meds, and stopped taking them a few months ago. This is such a sad, stressful, sordid situation, I just wanted to reach out and ask for some suppport or wise words.

I know. 

We have a lot of resources to peruse. But I just want to get some individual help.

I started drinking in 2005. I have a friend who introduced me to alcohol but the fucker himself is not addicted and has extraordinary self - control (he is not addicted to anything, not even tea or coffee, so I hate his guts but he is also one of my closest friends).

The pandemic made everything worse.

I went from maybe half a bottle of vodka per month to a bottle a week.

I tried very hard to quit. I stopped completely on Dec 31, 2020 and was sober until Feb 12, 2021 (my birthday). That was when my real downfall began. Every week I drank a 750 ml bottle. My work suffered. I was not healthy. So many colds. No exercise. One day, the elevators to my condo were out and I struggled to make it to the 5th floor where my apartment was.

My worst problem is that I like drinking alone. And I live alone. So drinking is an easy answer to all problems.

I have been able to dial it down to half a bottle (375 ml) a week but I want to make it 0 ml. I am pretty sure that I will get addicted to anything easily (was on cigarettes since 2005, but was able to miraculously quit because of canadian winter and juul. Marijuana affects me badly so was never able to get hooked).

I‚Äôve been on this sobriety journey for a while and have loved it, on the whole.

 I‚Äôve loved it but up until now I haven‚Äôt had any ‚Äúlife setbacks‚Äù to challenge me. I failed. Not spectacularly, but I failed. I drank 4 mini bottles of wine.

I‚Äôm embarrassed I even applied (hello, imposter syndrome!)

They sent me probably the nicest ever rejection letter (personalised, not generic)‚Ä¶ but my brain still interpreted the rejection as ‚Äúlicense to drink‚Äù.

What‚Äôs weird to me is that my brain was saying: ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt get the job because you need to be Better and you need to be: more sparkly, more memorable, more outgoing, more risk-taking, more confident‚Ä¶ and how do you usually do all those things ? By drinking!‚Äù

Does that make sense to anyone? Like: drinking makes me‚Ä¶. It makes me ‚ÄúMORE‚Äù

Throughout my extended periods of sobriety I haven‚Äôt really thought that was the case. I thought I was ‚Äúenough‚Äù by just being me, sober. But this small knock to my confidence has set me back.

2021-09-16 16:00:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/ppkuxa/i_ruined_my_relationship_because_of_alcohol_and_i/,I ruined my relationship because of alcohol and I can't forgive myself.,"My boyfriend of 1 year broke up with me 2 weeks ago because of a blackout episode I had. I have had a drinking problem for a long time, have been drinking way too heavily for about 10 years. I'm 29 and a pretty small woman and my small body coupled with my insatiable need to keep drinking until I reach oblivion has caused soooo many problems in my life but I would always stop for a while, figure it was fine, and start drinking again (I also come from a family that drinks heavily and heavy drinking has always been ""normal"") 

My boyfriend and I had just recently given our relationship another chance after breaking up for a few weeks. While we were together my drinking problem subsided A LOT because he doesn't drink, because I was happy, because I wasn't alone a lot etc. But one day two weeks ago I stopped on my way home from errands in the afternoon and bought a bottle of wine. I drank that. I then went to the bodega and got beers and slowly drank about 12 of them over the course of the night at my house alone. By midnight I had blacked out and facetimed and called my boyfriend a million times (he HATES me being drunk and hates even more when I called him) He said I was naked smoking a cigarette on my back porch which I don't remember. I don't remember anything I said to him.

The next day I said I was sorry but he didn't answer all day. I called him later that day, drunk again because I was so ashamed and embarrassed of what I did the night before. (I know that was completely dumb but I was just on a bender of anxiety and shame). Since then he told me he gave our relationship another shot and he's done now, and he can't forgive this.

I keep obsessing over every detail and decision in my head. Why did I need to get wine? Why did I keep drinking? Why did I drink again the next day. The shame and regret is making me sick to my stomach. I haven't drank at all since those 2 weeks, I've talked to my therapist and my uncle who is a recovering alcoholic and am going to start going to meetings. I want to make this the decision to change my life and be sober but I just can't believe that I ruined a relationship that I cared about so much over this (he told me ""you don't care about this relationship because if you did you wouldn't have done this and that hurt so bad). I don't know how to process my shame and guilt, I don't know how to stop obsessing over what I did. I miss my boyfriend so bad and I feel so lonely. I want to be sober but I'm so afraid these feelings of guilt, shame, regret, worthlessness will become to much and lead me to drink again. :(",22,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80413264}"

I know if I can turn it off while I'm still in bed the temptation to go back to sleep will be strong. So I just take that out of the equation. Other people hit snooze multiple times, or turn off their alarms and get up in a few minutes without a problem. But every morning I feel a strong temptation to just go back to sleep.

I think it's the same with alcohol. There are plenty of people who can have a few drinks and still ""get up on time."" Truthfully, I can too. Just not all the time. And it takes willpower to do. It just works better for me to move the alarm across the room.

This wasn't good enough for the wife, who I've broken numerous promises to trying to keep my drinking under control. I always say I'll drink a certain amount and when she finds out I've gone over that, we start over. That has finally hit a brick wall with an ultimatum, it's either the booze or her. I can't get over the idea that she's trying to control me. 

Maybe she's right, it's been two months sober since that ultimatum and I do feel a little better, but it's not outrageously better. I didn't lose a bunch of weight. There hasn't been an overwhelming epiphany of awesome. I miss drinking.

We had an argument about masking (of all things), and I put this argument into the ""she's trying to control you box"" right next to this alcohol issue. So I went out and got a case of beer and told her about it. She knew about it, she knew I put a couple in the fridge for the nightly ritual, and she promptly threw all of it away. I, however, had a headache and went to bed early that night. I was completely ignorant she did this. This was the message I sent to her this morning:

""I had full intention of putting those cold beers back in the case, and I was going to feel good about that, like I was taking a good step toward beating my addiction. You took that away from me and put this ultimatum back in my face, just like AA, there is no other choice but to quit drinking forever, that I'm powerless to do anything about it. You're putting this emasculating powerlessness back on me with this ultimatum you've given me and I can't live under it forever. We have to find some other way to do this""

Reading this post and evaluating my feelings is therapeutic, but I'd like to hear from others who may be in a similar situation. I do think I'm in the wrong here.

I‚Äôm so grateful to the medical professionals I‚Äôve seen over the years, particularly those I came into contact with when I got sober. I will never forget the professionals at the detox centre, the nurse who came to my house to start said detox, the counsellor I saw for a few weeks afterwards as I settled into a newly sober life. I don‚Äôt know how I could have managed without them. Sure, they‚Äôre paid to do this, but I was met with a lot of genuine care along the way, too. I still think of them, every now and again. They must see so many people and change so many lives and barely give it a second thought. I wish I could tell them all how much I appreciate them and owe them for where I am, right now. Compassion was so critical for me in the early days and it was hard to muster it up for myself - receiving compassionate care from those who helped me get sober was invaluable. I am so thankful for them.

That‚Äôs it from me. Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share whatever you‚Äôre appreciating right now - big or small.

I'm not a black-out-hammered every day drinker, but when it gets to about 5pm, I start dreading an entire evening ahead with my thoughts and generally go straight to the fridge to fix that.

I managed a month of sobriety a few years ago, but since the pandemic, alcohol stopped being an option, and became a necessary part of my psychology. Like many of you have pointed out on here, somehow booze grabs control of your sense-making machinery and convinces you it's *just one drink*. It never is. One drink is worse than none, and the inevitable ten that follow after are a great deal worse than one.

What's kicked my ass a few times now is euphoria. There's no getting around it, those first few hours of a good buzz are ecstatic. When the grey days hit, it's extremely difficult abstaining, knowing that a few beers and a whisky will make everything fun, and temporarily kill anxiety and malaise.

**Temporarily** is the operative word, as you know. In return for a few fun hours, the next day (days, sometimes) is completely screwed, no motivation, despair, all that lovely stuff. If I was doing proper fun-to-misery analysis, I'd never have started drinking in the first place. A few hours of euphoria for 24 hours in the hole. What the hell is that about.

By coincidence I've just noticed 100 days from today is Christmas. 3 months sounds like a lot for some reason - 100 days doesn't. (Really it isn't. 100 days ago was early June, and that feels close enough.) I've been so inspired by the stories of kicking alcoholism's ass here, all the pain and help, it's been the first time it began to feel like booze isn't an indispensable part of my personality, but a trap I got my foot caught in, and can get it back out with willpower. So I'll be doing that. And I hope you'll join me too.

I'm rather excited to find out what 100 days dry feels like. I'm terrified to be honest, terrified of the 5pm days, and having to sit through those grey hours with willpower or distraction, terrified I'll lose my 'edge', but I still remember a time when I was sober long enough for those hours to go away. I used to be entirely functional without drinking, like, an actual whole person and everything. It's a reward system problem, and I'd rather like to solve it. Again: Christmas is exactly 100 days away. If you'd like to join on this adventure, that would be lovely. I'll check back in with periodic updates. It's just nice not being alone in this, really.",52,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4608054}"

2021-09-16 02:16:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pp7s10/a_different_perspective/,A different perspective.,"I myself am not an alcoholic. Stay with me though, for my heart has been heavy the past couple years because my boyfriend is. This is long, but sharing this will hopefully help me and someone else out there.

I met my boyfriend when he was 25, quickly approaching 26. We started off as just friends and coworkers, and our friendship developed into a relationship. He bartended at the hotel I worked at, and after long nights at work we would drink socially with our co workers. We drank together just the two of us as well and got to know each other from ‚Äúcatching up over some beers or mixed drinks.‚Äù We never hung out sober. He introduced me to his friends, and we partied with them too. Then the pandemic hit, and there was nothing really to do but to go to each other‚Äôs houses and drink and play video games and eat take out, and drink more. Every thing we did started developing around drinking. Every time I would come over he began even get upset if I came over ‚Äúempty handed.‚Äù He started drinking before I‚Äôd come over and he would have already drank all day snowboarding then drive home intoxicated. Most of the time I‚Äôd offer to drive to his house so he wasn‚Äôt on the road even more and he would take hours to show up when we only lived less than 15 min from each other. 

I began to feel like an afterthought. He became so lazy he wouldn‚Äôt even text or call me back. I felt like my existence was an inconvenience to him. It hurt more than I can ever put into words. He would smoke weed and drink all day. He was so sedated he didn‚Äôt have room to care about me or my needs. I had to really be careful what I‚Äôd say around him when he was drinking bc if I upset him it ended up in him blowing up at me and me crying and sometimes going home. It was really hard to deal with, but something in me never let me give up or walk away. I began seeing this was a problem, when I‚Äôd confront him he would get more upset and call me ‚Äúlame‚Äù, boring, ‚Äúa drag,‚Äù ‚Äúa mom‚Äù, all those type of things. It really hurt. The worst part is he would say insanely mean stuff to me but I had convinced myself it was okay bc ‚Äúhe‚Äôs drunk and doesn‚Äôt mean it.‚Äù He would say ‚ÄúI was blacked out‚Äù like he didn‚Äôt realize he was still responsible for his actions.

I never wanted my friends to change how the felt about my boyfriend so I never told anyone. It felt so lonely and hard to deal with emotionally and physically. I would cry at home alone all the time asking myself why he didn‚Äôt care about me more. Fast forward to earlier this summer there was a situation that occurred that lead me to calling the police bc I couldn‚Äôt handle it on my own anymore.

Long story short he was forced to sober up and finally take a long look in the mirror and he don‚Äôt like who he saw. Alcoholics aren‚Äôt bad people, they are likely lost, or hurting/broken from unresolved issues/traumas and never learned a healthy way to cope. 

Fast forward to today my boyfriend is almost 100 days sober. He looks better, he‚Äôs more kind, his personality is more gentle and he is not constantly angry. He remembers more of what I say, he‚Äôs way less selfish and I genuinely enjoy being around him so much more. The biggest (life-changing) improvements is I trust him around my kids now, and I feel safe in the car with him. I can finally relax and not worry as much. He actually asks how my day is and cares. His eyes sparkle now when they were constantly glazed over. 

Alcohol hurts the significant other too. but Im proud of who my boyfriend is today. We are taking some space to focus on healing. He is going to therapy and he‚Äôs trying to better himself for his family and for me. I believe things happen for a reason because there was no future with us the direction things were heading. Alcohol made him so complacent - I‚Äôm so happy to meet this version of him. I know this may be a long road but I believe that we met for a reason, and our relationship was honestly going in circles, I started asking myself ‚Äúwhat are you even doing, this isn‚Äôt love.‚Äù
He needs someone who believes in him and will not run when things get difficult. He helps me see the world from a different point of view and loves me more than I know. Sometimes people just need to know that someone believes in them.

We now have future plans to move in together and get married. Before this would‚Äôve been a bad idea, but now we have a bright future to look forward to together.

I shared this with you today because I had a night terror last night of the old version of him, and I woke up happy knowing that things are only going to get better for us.

A decade ago I had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, and yet found myself working in a bar. After six months of unlimited staff drinks, many hangovers, and a lot of embarrassing and/or endangering myself, I realized I had to quit drinking or I would die. So I did, I stayed sober and worked at the bar for 3 years. 

After that I moved states and started my career. When I was around ppl who drank, I started thinking I could too. Bc hey, I‚Äôm no longer working in a bar.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

I‚Äôve fallen in love with this quote from MLK over the past 9.5 months. I have the saying ‚ÄúKeep Moving Forward‚Äù tattooed in my brain. I feel like sobriety gives us the ability to be just a little bit better than we were yesterday. Sobriety gives us the opportunity to be just a little bit happier than we were when we were drinking (or a lot happier in my case). Sobriety gives us the chance to keep moving forward, even if it‚Äôs one small baby step at a time.  

**What will you do today (besides not drink) to keep moving forward??** 

I‚Äôm going to NOT eat refined sugar for the 18th day in a row because that makes me feel better. And I may go for a walk tonight with a good friend.

I wish you all a wonderful Thursday!! I love you all and IWNDWYT!!

2021-09-16 00:03:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pp60gv/ive_been_working_through_tsmvivitrol_for_9_months/,I've been working through TSM/Vivitrol for 9 months. I haven't drank in 43 days. My partner of 4 years told me they don't like me sober. I'm here for some advice.,"*tl;dr: my partner (who is an addict) said they don't like sober me...have you ever experienced this? How did you handle the situation?*

As the title says...

I have been a daily drinker for 10 years. My partner and I have been dating for 4 of those years. I started TSM/Vivitrol in February of 2021. I'm 9 months in and haven't had anything to drink in 43 days. 

I'm super proud of myself and I know I've made the right decisions along the way. My life is slowly coming together and I'm truly enjoying it. 

When I first started dating my partner they were one year sober from opioid abuse. I give them props for being around me for so long while I wasn't sober.  In October 2020 they started abusing their drug of choice again and moved onto a newer drug as well. Unfortunately, I didn't know they were using again until March of 2021.

They had always wanted me to stop drinking, and I always envisioned us sober together. So, when February came around and I started Vivitrol I was excited for us to be on the sober journey together --again I didn't know they were using again. 

They've been on and off for the last 9 months, and we've had discussions about sobriety. I'm still going to pursue my sobriety no matter their choice. However, what is discouraging is that this past week they told me that they didn't like who I was sober. They preferred who I was when we had first started dating...the drunk me that was docile and quiet...withdrawn. 

My doctor warned me that some of the people in my life wouldn't like me getting sober and would try to sabotage it. To me, my partner saying what they said was exactly like what my doctor had warned me of. I asked my partner about it but they said they weren't ""threatened"" by my sobriety, but did make a remark about ""doing what they couldn't do"". 

So, I'm here to ask...anyone that has had a period of not drinking...has your partner (maybe a friend or family member) said they didn't like you sober? How did you handle it?  What were your thoughts? Did you remain sober? Any advice is welcome and appreciated.

I don't know if I will ever tell them about it (I'm definitely not ready to tell them about it anytime soon).

I had a discussion with my father tonight about my partner's alcoholic dad. Then my dad said that ""I set a good example for you. I didn't get wasted around you. I didn't smoke around you. I didn 't do drugs around you. This is why you aren't a drug or alcohol addict. People who grow up around drunks and addicts have a high chance of becoming one thenselves"".
This kind of upset me because I AM an alcoholic, even though my dad raised me right. Yes, being around drunks and addicts at a young age will definitely put you at risk for becoming a drunk and addict yourself, but that's not always the case. I know that alcoholism does not discriminate, but clearly my dad has some different views on alcohol and drug addiction than people my age do.
Even though my parents were divorced, they were amicable and shared custody of me 50/50. They both taught me good from bad. They both set wonderful examples for me. They both busted their asses at good paying jobs to provide for me. I ate well. I did all sorts of fun activities. I travelled. I am well educated due to the funds they provided me to pay my college tuition. They did everything right, and still, I fell trap to alcoholism. 
I have no reason to be an alcoholic either, other than pure and simple boredom. I tell doctors I binge drank because I was bored. Yes i had bad things happen to me in my life, but my main reason for drinking was to escape the boredom of my seemingly mundane life. 
I quit drinking because it was just starting to affect my health (kidney pain, right upper abdominal pain). I wasn't physically dependent because I was only a binge drinker (2x a week). It was easy, but I miss it.

The second half of my nightmare was me sitting down to dinner with my immediate and extended family, nothing unusual, except I had an oversized glass of wine filled to the brim.

I woke up soon after ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù my nightmare-wine. I felt sick, both mentally (guilty, ashamed, and weak) and physically (nauseous, wanted to cry). It all felt uncomfortably real and way too close to true. It felt like a betrayal, like my sleeping brain had had a drink. 

I know it was a dream. I fell asleep snuggling my toddler to sleep, my husband woke me up at 11, I brushed my teeth and went to bed. I did not drink yesterday, and despite wanting to to ease my discomfort, I will not drink today.

Although for the sake of context I‚Äôll give a bit of a backstory of where I am at and have been. 

Longtime drinker(20 years+) i was a ‚Äúhigh functioning ‚Äú type. In reality I was a nightmare to be around. I had a few short periods of sobriety in my 20‚Äôs but it never lasted. Fast forward some years, married, kids, house, busy job. It didn‚Äôt take long for it to start to implode either.  August of last year I decided to get help. I went to weekly therapy for almost a year. Have been relentlessly doing the ‚Äúwork‚Äù trying to make things right. Trying not just for the family but for me. I am 11 months and a few days sober now!  Things are going much better. Not easy by any stretch but less messy than when I was drunk all the time. 

So now at almost a year of sobriety things have evened off and are going well. My biggest issue as I keep (trying)moving forward is feeling like an impostor most of the time. As if to say I am mourning the loss of my former self. Or maybe my addict mind is trying to convince me I am not capable or worthy of what I have. 

So if any of this makes sense, & you can relate‚Ä¶. How did or are you moving through this?

I had 8 months sober but then over the past five months have had multiple slips. 

I am so lonely and I don't know how to fix it. It's not a loneliness that a couple of hours with a friend can erase. It's a loneliness I was born with. I've always felt this way, even as a child. I've searched and searched for something to take it away and nothing has. Booze does temporarily. 

I started a new job a month ago. It is fully remote and always will be (with me across the country from the main office), I live alone, and am single. This new job is highly bureaucratic, with no room for any sort of chatting or humanity, and has extremely high expectations and a higher learning curve. I feel incompetent. But most of all I feel lonely. Working permanently alone has highlighted these feelings day after day. 

I don't know how to shake this deeply seated, ever-present, gnawing feeling. Even if I don't drink, I'm still alone. I'm stuck in my own head and so lonely.

Here are my pros and cons of not drinking. 

Pros

* No hangovers. It‚Äôs glorious.
* I haven‚Äôt thrown up once in three years, whereas I fell squarely into the ‚Äúpuke & rally‚Äù category previously. 
* I‚Äôm present wherever I am, with whatever I‚Äôm doing. No need to look into the future to figure out what I‚Äôm drinking, where I‚Äôm drinking, and how I‚Äôm gonna get from place to place. 
* Saved a lot of $$$. 
* My wife only gets annoyed with me for things like leaving clothes on the floor. No more shouting because I fell down the stairs trying to put my key in the front door. 
* I became a father since and I know I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for my daughter. 
* Lost a bunch of weight.
* Made massive leaps forward in my career doing work I absolutely love. 
* Several of my friends also stopped drinking, citing my example. They are prospering. 
* I‚Äôm a more attentive husband and son and brother and of course, father. 
* The people I love have saved money because they've got a built-in DD.
* My confidence has skyrocketed and anxiety has all but vanished. 
* Right after I quit drinking I was really angry at everything, all of the time. I was a very fun, happy drunk though. I got into therapy and began to address my actual issues rather than ignore them with booze. This has led to all sorts of good things, but this is my favorite - I've forgiven people who had wronged me, but more importantly, it‚Äôs led me to forgive myself. 
* Sleep is 1000% better and I wake up more rested. 
* I‚Äôm sick less - in fact, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve even had a cold since quitting. 
* I appreciate the little things more, specifically my hobbies. I started to write, collect legos, and play more games outside of my usual fare.
* Last, but certainly not least - I am finally, truly starting to love myself. 

Cons

* Literally, absolutely, positively nothing. There isn‚Äôt a single thing that‚Äôs worse because I stopped drinking. 

I'll end with this - if you think that I, a grown-ass-man, didn't cry my eyes out writing this list, you're very wrong. This has been very hard, but I allow myself to feel proud. And whether you've been sober for minutes or years, I'm proud of you. Take it one day at a time and allow yourself to feel great about what you've accomplished..

I have been largely unreliable in my personal life, leading to lost friendships and relationships. I‚Äôve embarrassed myself mostly personally, but sometimes professionally too. I didn‚Äôt want to confront my drinking, because I knew it would be hard. It was easier to just drink and forget it.

It was hard for a few reasons, but mostly because I come from a long unbroken line of alcoholics and problem drinkers from both sides of my family.

- [ ] One time I was in a relationship and I told my father that I was not drinking for a while, his response was that he would see me when I was drinking again, because it would be more fun. 
- [ ] Another time while visiting my father and his wife, we drank with her son, who has been in recovery for 10 years. I believe that was the only time he broke his sobriety since he got sober. They justified it by saying he was going to Iraq the next week for the Navy. I was nauseous for weeks afterwards, because I was part of that. 
- [ ] Last week, my brother came to my mothers house at 6am while I was staying there. He was at a level of inebriation I have rarely seen. Then he proceeded to pull his pants down and urinate down the steps to the basement.  Seeing him like that has rattled me to the core. I saw myself and It made me say enough. 

I say all of these awful things because they need to be said. My personal intake of alcohol destroyed a few years of my life due to my inability to drink responsibility. I‚Äôm on track now. The pandemic has made my life lonely, but my career is flourishing and I am learning to be fiscally responsible. Better late than never, I suppose.  I cannot confront my family about their issues until I fix my own.  The first thing I will do is no longer partake in their delusions.

I just turned 30. And my buddy who I‚Äôll call Kish, was 28. 

Both of us were in an Ivy League fraternity together. A lot of our friends are ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù Kish specifically had just ‚Äúmade it‚Äù in life. 

(I put it in quotes bc I‚Äôm having a crises of what ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù really means. But I‚Äôll save that for a different sub) 

He bought his mom a Tesla. He sublets apartments out to our friends who couldn‚Äôt afford nyc rentals‚Ä¶ He took care of his friends and family. Left no one behind. And honestly‚Ä¶ he was a little embarrassed by his wealth. 

Sadly, I blame this for some of the changes he went through lately. He had all the sudden a lot of stress, fake friends, and loved ones relying on him and his continued success. I suspect he suffered from imposter syndrome as well.

As far as his drinking, Kish was a lightweight. When we were pledging our frat he didn‚Äôt even like the stuff. Only drank when he had too. He drank to bring out his silly side that everyone loved. He was never on my radar as someone who I needed to worry about. Guess that changed..

Couple weeks ago Kish got drunk and bought a ticket on a whim from NYC to San Diego. A next day flight, he showed up at my house with nothing but his office attire and beach towel around his neck hahah..

This was first time in years since I got to hang out with him 1 on 1. His face looked different. His head was bigger and our convo wasn‚Äôt as sharp and witty as I remembered it always being. 

We drank and partied like old times. (I need to reset my counter..) Somehow we made it to my roof. If I remember correctly he wanted to hear the ocean. Being a few blocks from the beach we could hear it up there. At one point we were hanging off each other talking about how special and blessed we were to have the lives we have. Kish talked about how being a genuinely good person is the best way to be happy. It all seemed to be so perfect. 

So imagine my surprise when his best friend called me crying that Kish checked himself into the hospital, quickly went into a coma, and then died‚Ä¶

He had alcohol induced pancreatitis. It was too late by the time he went to the hospital. His organs had started to shut down. And his body gave up on him. 

Add him to the list‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm mad bc if he didn‚Äôt exist in a world in which self-medicating with alcohol is considered OK, or FUN, or admired by those who consider you successful, then he‚Äôd be alive today. 

We all saw him dropping thousands at a club because he wanted to be around ppl, we saw him drinking Pacifico‚Äôs on the roof at 1am because he wanted to hear the ocean, we saw him go to bed with a white claw in his hand each night. We just never thought to talk to him about it being a problem. And now he‚Äôs dead because of it. 

I‚Äôm alive and able to be sharing his story because of my own close call. (I wrote about it here a while ago) it scared me straight. Sometimes I fuck up and have a bender with old frat bros like Kish when they show up‚Ä¶

From the stories I read here on this sub I KNOW you are aware that ppl are not as lucky as me to survive a wake up call. Rock bottom, clarity, call it what you want. That ‚Äúchance‚Äùis not given to everyone. Sometimes their wake up call kills them.

I've made myself a 100 day promise, which would truly be my all time record. I figure that will get me to the holiday season and I'll have so much momentum built up I'll say 'why stop at 100!' But what about days 21-28? Why do they always beat on me so bad!!

Then I got 3 day and drank again. ""It's the return of football. I can drink to that!"" Had no intention of drinking the next day.

Then my dad's dumb ass got fired because of course that would happen. I've been drinking every day since then. I can feel how easy it is to slide right back into old habits. I wouldn't say I'm scared of how easy, but more annoyed. Like, damn, this shit's a battle every single day. It's effort every single day. And I HATE doing things. If it requires a lot of effort, or constant effort, I usually bail and avoid that. 

But anyway, I went to the liquor store last night. Bought a pint of my usual, but also left with a job application. Does it make sense for an alcoholic to work at a liquor store? Probably not, but I look forward to it. For starters, it would be the first job I've had in 3 years, so building confidence and not having to stress about being broke all the time will do wonders for my mental health. Also it's close to home, so when one of the cars inevitably breaks down and needs repaired, I can still make it to work.

This is my first time posting. Long time lurker. 

I have tried to work back my alcohol intake for quite some time. Unsuccesfully. In some way i hoped lurking and reading your stories helped. It didnt,  not always anyway, yet still very much appreciated. I now hope that by getting actively involved it will help. In some way at least. 

I am a 30yo male. I was first drunk  (=puke) when I was 13. Shortly after  I met my older friends (still friends to this day) and my first pub time was when i was 15. Plenty of social drinking outside of the pub. Super fun time, i guess, i got used to drinking as it is socialy acceptable. 

Early college (~19yo) was big time drinking. Friday noon happy hour, sure thing. Drinking whenever appropriate (ofc not always). Weed every day. 

When i got into masters (~23) i was very busy. But when off, drinking. I once said out loud: if i werent so busy  i would be an alcoholic. 

After my masters (~26) i started a phd. Stress was sky high and drinking was the only way i ever learned to manage emotions, get a break. And did it break me. I got close to a burn out and reached out to social work within university. Unable to work for months. Got some cognitive therapy. No success. Every day drinking anyway. Did finish phd, i dont give up easily.

I now have a job in industry for over a year or so. Very fun job. But i cant lay the drink of anymore. I try, oh I try. It affects me in so many ways. Relation ruined. Doing job suboptimal. Depressed all the time. 

The reason i reach out now is that my very best friend called me a heavy alcoholic to his other friends. I overheard. I have contacted my gp. 

I am astonished by the grip alcohol has on me. I am otherwise a pretty down to earth guy. I love life, although depression gets a hold on me every once in a while. Alcohol invigorates the depression obviously. I hate alcohol very deeply, but it sometimes seems like the only love i have.

Kind of self therapy...? I guess? Just trying to find the why's and how's in my head.

I may relate, and it may help me through a day or two, but at the end of the day, where we are, were, and going is totally different. This communities answers might guide me, but when the curtain closes they're not going to be my answers to the T. I have to find that out for myself. 

In this, I've just realized that it doesn't have to be about the days of sobriety, but rather sobriety as a whole as a lifestyle. Before, what I called abstinence, now I call sobriety. They're effectively the same thing, just one now has history. 

One thing I've been able to do is cut back on how much I drink when I do. Pretty dramatically actually. Instead of 15 beers, I've consistently only drank 7 or 8. Pretty substantial. 

Also just in general, just at more peace with myself. I don't feel the need to run away from myself by chasing being drunk. I don't feel the need to be detached.

For years I‚Äôve lied to myself and pretended that I could cope with life despite the amount I drink. In 2018 I started to develop severe depression and anxiety and have used alcohol even more since to try and mask it. Some days it worked, but a lot of times I felt so so much worse. A few weeks ago I came close to committing suicide after a huge row with my girlfriend and a litre of vodka. Crashing my car on a long quiet road was my plan, and even after spending a night in a prison cell due to being caught drink driving I told myself I just needed to cut down.

I started to slip back into serious drinking and suffered a psychotic break on Saturday night which terrified my girlfriend. Only after finally being honest with her, my family, my doctor and particularly myself did I finally realise I couldn‚Äôt live like this anymore. And this didn‚Äôt mean suicide but trying to finally stop drinking. With my girlfriend and family‚Äôs support I‚Äôve admitted that I need to stop drinking altogether and have today just been checked into an alcohol addiction clinic.

I‚Äôve just finished the induction part of the stay and despite the initial fear of this whole journey to sobriety, I feel positive about finally trying to tackle this problem with all the strength I‚Äôve got.

This is only day 2 of being sober but I hope to keep posting on here as a way of documenting this journey. They let me keep my phone and my e-cigarette which are the highs I‚Äôm focusing on right now!",19,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4814634}"

# Filling the emptiness

Page 269  


""*...we think that if we can just get enough food, enough sex, or enough money, we'll be satisfied and everything will be alright.*""  


Basic Text, p.80  


In our addiction, we could never get enough drugs, or money, or sex, or anything else. Even too much was never enough! There was a spiritual emptiness inside us. Though we tried as hard as we could to fill that emptiness ourselves, we never succeeded. In the end, we realized that we lacked the power to fill it; it would take a Power greater than ourselves to do that.  


So we stopped using, and we stopped trying to fill the emptiness in our gut with *things*. We turned to our Higher Power, asking for its care, strength, and direction. We surrendered and made way for that Power to begin the process of filling our inner void. We stopped grabbing things and started receiving the free gift of love our Higher Power had for us. Slowly, our inner emptiness was being filled.  


Now that we've been given our Higher Power's gift of love, what do we do with it? If we clasp that gift tightly to ourselves, we will smother it. We must remember that love grows only when it is shared. We can only keep this gift by freely giving it away. The world of addiction is a world of taking and being taken; the world of recovery is a world of giving and being given. In which world do we choose to live?  


**Just for Today:** I choose to live in the fullness of recovery. I will celebrate my conscious contact with the God of my understanding by freely sharing with others that which has been freely shared with me.",7,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5034986}"

Three months ago I was drinking around three bottles of vodka a week. It made me forget how unhappy I was. Today and then, my life are almost identical. None of my friends even noted I stopped drinking. My wife only mentioned it during the first two weeks when I was going through withdrawal. 

When I drank and showed up to work hungover and it didn‚Äôt impact my job performance - guess writing that now I realize it did and that I‚Äôm lying. The truth is it didn‚Äôt hurt my job performance enough for anyone to notice because I‚Äôm a lot better at my job than others I work with.

After I got to college my drinking really increased but was still manageable.

Starting my junior year however, after turning 21, I really began to get out of control. I would be easily drinking more than 60 beers a week by winter, not including any drinks while out at bars. Seeing this I decided to try to cut back, which did work for a while until this last summer.

Once the school year ended I started to go off the deep end. My friends and I began to drink 5-6 days a week, and I began to get severe anxiety waking up after a long bender. I thought that the start of the school year would help cut me back however I found there were only more opportunities to drink since everything seemed back to normal with COVID.

My last straw with alcohol was when I woke up on my friends couch in a whole different city, not knowing how I got there (I took a bus). I woke up uncontrollably shaking and couldn‚Äôt imagine the ride back without drinking before. I made the the decision that day that I would quit drinking. 

It‚Äôs been 3 days since I last had a drink now, which is the longest I‚Äôve gone in months. I‚Äôve been fortunate that I‚Äôve only had mild symptoms so far. My biggest fear is how to adjust to my new life. My entire social life for the last 3 years has revolved around drinking. My friends support me, but they all drink at bars and parties on the weekends and I don‚Äôt want them to stop for me.

Tonight I'll be sleeping on my own couch instead of someone else's [until I buy a mattress but hey I found a comfy couch for $50].

I've been using alcohol as a crutch or a hug this past month as my relationship officially lost any chance of recovery.  He moved on already.  But,  I can't afford to drink. I promised myself that I won't bring the habit into my new apartment. So

Still keeping my guard up though. Yesterday, a (newer) friend of mine invited a few of us over to his house on Saturday to a party. He mentioned to me that he heard ""I can put them back"" and would like to see for himself - oof! I replied ""I don't know about that"" and changed the topic. 

Needless to say I will not be attending. I think if I went the pressure from others would be high. Quite frankly, I can't really think of anything I'd like to do less than go to someone's party right now.

Thinking about it, being the guy that ""can put them back"" is really the last thing I'd like to be known for. I'd rather be known for being kind, understanding, and a hard worker ... all that good stuff. I'll be sure to keep that in mind moving forward.

However, after a receiving a couple of comments I just weighed myself for the first time since May and I have lost 8lbs! 

This may not sound like much but I have not dieted/exercised for this, my intense early sugar cravings have just naturally reduced over time, so now I think the affect of going AF is FINALLY coming through.

It got worse after moving from California to Western NY, especially after problems in my marriage led to its end. Don't get me wrong, I was unhappy in it which likely exacerbated my drinking. I've come to terms with most difficulties I've experienced since, losing my mom, meeting the challenges associated with raising autistic children, getting a DWI just before covid which led to me losing a rather good paying job, not having a very big or meaningful social circle where I live, etc. I spent a few days in psych last April which was the beginning of a fairly decent stint in my sobriety spanning almost half a year I believe. 

Then I started drinking for a couple months starting out with an amount that at least seemed manageable but eventually got out of control. I told this to my counselor who kinda freaked out. I just didn't feel like I was getting much out of his overly positive outlook. May of this year I had an epiphany where I realized that the bulk of all the negativity I carried most of my life came from a fear that if I screwed up around other people bad enough, they would react with the same intensity and severity that my mom would at times. She had borderline personality disorder and was abused as a child. 

A month or so after that realization, I began to have a conversation in my head where I was taking credit for this newfound clarity of mind. Having so many negative thoughts all the time was so exhausting. But me taking credit for the change prompted a religious experience where I was reminded of how freaked out I was as a child about everything and felt so helpless in terms of learning everything I needed to learn, so I turned to God at a young age. It was then that I realized God never left me, I just couldn't feel His presence anymore. 

So anyways, I started going to church, and a friend of mine is visiting. Before I left for Vegas (which is where I currently am) I started having a couple beers a night with him, and just sort of continued. Monday night I had too much to drink that gave me heart palpitations Tuesday, and I currently can't sleep, or rather, I normally can't the night after drinking so much and don't want to try. This is partially because over the past couple months I've been getting these rather intense feelings of dread. I don't feel it right now, but it gives me a fear at times that if I go to sleep I might not wake up. The heart palpitations seem to be a new thing, but after clearing out the bulk of the negativity from my head a few months ago, I've been paying much closer attention to the various sensations I feel. So because of this, and because I've been scaring myself about the health complications of my drinking, especially now that I notice it affecting my heart, I've decided to quit again. 

I want to get involved in this church I've been going to as well; maybe that's a part of the dread I feel, knowing I am doing things that are at odds with who I want to be. I have a lot of knowledge with the bible and want to share that. I miss being a part of a community too. I told myself I would only stick to beer, but even with that I ended up overindulging to the point I still had a nasty hangover. I don't want to go threw this anymore, so I'm done drinking. Already swore off weed a couple months ago, and that stuck because I made a promise to God, in spite of my friend who is staying with me still likes to light up. I'm hoping the health concerns will be enough to keep me from drinking.

I just hit 7 days sober, im kinda happy but still struggling.

I dont really have anyone close to lean on at the moment, and living alone while having money is making this even harder because there is nothing stopping me other than myself, and self control is hard..

The sooner you make the change, the better. Alcohol damages the brain and body in ways so many of us will never know until it is too late. It‚Äôs a literal poison‚Äî rotting your mind, disrupting your neurochemistry. It ruins vital organs all while upsetting your eat/sleep habits, which are the foundation of our most basic function. And for those here who drink to soothe anxiety, depression, PTSD, you're fighting a fire with fuel. It's such a nasty trap. I don't mean to come here and blast you with things you already know but it astounds me that so few know how evil the drink can be. 

I drank and used until it cost me my job, my relationship, then my living situation. While in the most dark and destructive depression I‚Äôve ever known I remained staunchly convinced that I functioned better under the influence. **It is beyond belief what that shit does to your head**. You‚Äôll be able to think and feel so much clearer without it.

Realized it wasn‚Äôt worth the anxiety the next day and wanted to take a break. And I started with the goal of two weeks and just kept going. 

These past couple days I‚Äôve just felt really down and on edge. My best friend had been ignoring me and just acting strange. I tried hard to set up a time to hang out
Or even get some sort of normal response from her, but she just wouldn‚Äôt. I tried to give her space although I couldn‚Äôt think of anything I did wrong.

I woke up to a number of shocking texts that still make me feel so anxious to my core. 

Three months ago her boyfriend proposed. They‚Äôve been dating for over eight years, she‚Äôs shown him the ring she wanted, he told her it was coming soon, it wasn‚Äôt like this crazy surprise thing. 
The week leading up to it I had to take their dog, he called off work, and made her switch her shift. I brought up that this seemed special and excitingly asked if she thought anything was going to happen and to make sure she had her nails done, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to be prepared. Apparently this really messed with her mind and completely ruined the surprise of it all. She didn‚Äôt tell me this and just took months of space to process it all.

 I feel AWFUL. I never ever meant to make her nervous or ruin a surprise, I really didn‚Äôt know it was even happening, the conversations about it came up so organically in my mind. Idk I was so sad for months of her not responding, and now knowing why I just can‚Äôt express how sad and hurt I am. There are so many factors I‚Äôm not going to get into but it just sucks.

Relationship, or lack of one aside, I'm actually feeling great. Some things are so stark in my sobriety... And I'm putting myself first and taking care of myself for the first time in a long time.

It's a strange, but not bad feeling, to be proud of myself. I'm trying to pick up some hobbies again, like writing and playing guitar. More free time and a renewed interest in things has got me looking for hobbies outside the gym. 

No more drinking. No more smoking. Eating healthier and actually feeling good. Planning a move to get myself around a better support system. Looking for a better job, instead of being content with bs in my drunken stupor. I'm actually looking forward to continuing to be better. It's a nice feeling, honestly.

I‚Äôm a 24 year old male who has been drinking and smoking weed daily since sophomore year of college. My girlfriend lives with me and also enjoys dancing with the devil. 

I admitted to myself several months ago that I‚Äôm an alcoholic, plain and simple. Ever since then I‚Äôve been trying to navigate the challenging journey of sobriety with several failed attempts. 

I would stop for a few days and then think I had everything under control. How wrong I was. The day after having a drink I‚Äôd find myself waiting at the liquor store at 11am waiting for it to open so I could have my six pack and then smoke half a gram of distillate (85% thc). 

My first failed attempts were a result of me only putting one foot forward and not both. I thought to mysef ‚ÄúI‚Äôll smoke weed to help take my mind off the alcohol,‚Äù but as i‚Äôm sure others can relate to, that only made my cravings worse. Not just that, but it made my thinking and decision making skills go out the window. Of course I ended right back at square one.. But not this time. 

I‚Äôm 7.5 days totally sober and am feeling much more optimistic in life. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the first 4 days were brutal. I had night sweats, hands shaking, incredibly irritable mood, but I knew that this was just my brain chemistry changing and the process of toxin removal had begun. I found what helps me most is reading what others have gone through and what works for them. Knowing i‚Äôm not alone in this journey has brought some peace of mind and given me confidence. 

That being said, I know my journey has just begun and I have an enormous amount of work to do. Here are some tips that have been helpful to me thus far in the early stages:

1) Exercise daily and go for walks. This helps take my mind off the cravings in a healthy way.

2) Tell your loved ones and close friends about your intentions to stay sober. Nothing is worse than having a family member or girlfriend asking if you want a beer (atleast for me during the early stages, hopefully this will pass).

3) Listen to podcasts. This is a great way to combat bordom and there are so many different topics to listen to.

4) Netflix/Video games/music/hobbies/sports all help immerse yoursef in something other than drinking.

Good day everyone and happy Wednesday!  

I believe it was J.K. Rowling who said, **‚ÄúRock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.‚Äù**  I absolutely love this quote.  My ‚Äúrock bottom‚Äù was on Thursday, November 26, 2020. It wasn‚Äôt that anything particularly horrible happened that morning. I had many other instances of bad decisions, close calls, and injuries that ‚Äúshould‚Äù have been my rock bottom but never were. On 11/26/20 it‚Äôs just that I woke up, once again, with a pounding headache, dry mouth, red eyes, bloated everything, miserable attitude, and a feeling of complete invisibility‚Ä¶ Oh, and in the dress I had worn the day before. I looked in the mirror and honestly did not recognize myself. I HATED the person staring back at me. I told myself ‚ÄúNo more. This HAS to stop.‚Äù  I had been battling mentally for YEARS, knowing that I had a problem but not having any idea how to stop, or if I could stop. I felt I wasn‚Äôt brave or strong enough to stop.  I went to one AA meeting a decade prior but thought to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not THAT bad. I hold down a good job, I‚Äòve never been arrested, never gotten a DUI, etc‚Äù. The truth about that is I‚Äôve just been lucky. With some of the $hit I‚Äôve done while drunk, I‚Äôm truly lucky to be alive, quite honestly. So, I just suffered in silence for 10 more effing years. Even when my best friend got sober, I didn‚Äôt.  I kept this dirty little secret about how much I was drinking all to myself. I even married a man who drank as much, if not more than me. My life revolved around alcohol and partying....until, it wasn't a party anymore.  It was no longer fun.  I was no longer me.  Finally, I hit my rock bottom of not wanting to live that way anymore. I am now in the process of completely rebuilding my life, one stone at a time, on a foundation of knowing what I don‚Äôt want and working to discover what I do want. **So, what are you rebuilding on your sober foundation?**

It crushed me. It was 2 months before one year of sobriety and was the closest I have come to a relapse. 

5 years ago he said it was his birthday and he hadn‚Äôt had any plans because he didn‚Äôt have many friends. Which was true. So I felt bad for him we were coworkers and got along great so I said dude your turning 27 let‚Äôs go do something. I got 2 other office guys together and decided we would golf because that‚Äôs what he liked. I had played but really I had just played whack fuck. 

After that day golf consumed my life turns out he was decent and gave me pointers and I wanted to do nothing more but improve. Every year we got together played 18 holes and partied. It was some of the best times I had. 

Fast forward he moved to Texas the last time I saw him I was getting a blender he didn‚Äôt wanna take gave him a hug told him to take care of himself and that was the last time I physically saw him. The day he died I texted him a selfie of me and another good friend on the course and said ‚Äúlook what I found.‚Äù He said lol I miss you guys. That was the last thing I ever said to him. 

His sister who is the only person left in that family now has been talking with me and I her. It‚Äôs been weird we were brought together by tragedy but are very involved with each other now. She‚Äôs a couple years younger than me but we talk and are good friends. 

We both are struggling. It‚Äôs so hard the first year. I‚Äôve maintained my sobriety through the worst of it but I miss being able to call him and say ‚Äúhappy birthday you old bastard.‚Äù We we‚Äôre such good friends and even though we lived hundreds of miles away we never stopped being great friends. We would get talk on the phone for hours. 

I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm sober. I made it. Jason didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll never forget that phone call when it was time to pull the plug. The last thing I said to him was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry it played out this way I love you.‚Äù On a phone held next to his brain dead body. We had some lively times. We had more pain than joy but we always had fun. 

I know wherever he is he‚Äôs pissed at me for being so upset he‚Äôs gone. He‚Äôs also prolly pissed I did not carry out his final wish. To dump his ashes in the frosty machine at Wendy‚Äôs. He was so funny and so talented. I miss my friend every day. So just for today for his memory I‚Äôm not gonna drink. Stay strong IWNDWYT.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.45291027}"
2021-09-14 22:50:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pohj7j/i_genuinely_have_a_pretty_great_life_but_still/,I genuinely have a pretty great life but still feel like alcohol plays too big of a role in my life and I should probably stop. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience.,"Throwaway for reasons...so as the title states I really do have a pretty good life. I'm in my late 30's, have a nice house, 2 great kids, a good job, a healthy retirement account, and a few investment properties. The problem is I drink everyday and I don't like it. I've hesitated to share here because I don't have the horror stories or excessive drinking habits that so many others that post here do. Let me clarify that...I DO have those horror stories from years ago but over the last couple years my alcohol usage went from all out binges a few days a week with no usage on the other days, to drinking everyday but not really ever getting blacked out.

 So why do I hate that I drink if it's not causing me any real negative problems? Well, for starters..I hate that my kids see me and their mom drink all the time and I hate that once every couple weeks when we're with friends or any day that we're on an actual vacation they'll see me actually drunk. I don't get ""drunk"" most times...I'll have 5 or 6 drinks over the course of an evening on my days off and maybe 1 or 2 drinks on days I work. For reference ""Drinks"" for me is a couple shots of vodka mixed with water and flavoring.

2nd reason is that I hate being dependent on a substance. For me it's...going out to mow? Need to mix up a drink. Going to my sons football practice? Gonna mix up a drink to take with me. Going to watch a movie? Definitely gonna booze while I watch it. Going out on the boat..etc.. you get the picture. 

3rd reason I'm really starting to hate the habit is because I think it may be the cause of some panic attacks that have begun to pop up. I used to smoke weed somewhat regularly but cut it out because I thought that was the cause of my newly found anxiety. However having not been smoking for a few months and the panic attacks still popping up...especially after nights when I drink more than normal, I'm almost certain it's the booze. I've always been a little anxious on days after I drink but never really had full on panic attacks. At least not since my esrly 20's when...you guessed it...i was binge drinking multiple times a week. 

Lastly, I just feel like it's dulling my personality and my memory. I almost feel like I have to be at least buzzed to be in social situations and not be awkward. When having a conversation, even sober, I'll often find myself not being able to find a word that I know is in my vocabulary. 

I know that the amount I'm consuming is nothing compared to some of you and I know my ""problems"" are laughable compared to a lot of y'alls but I just don't wanna have to drink everyday anymore. I'm definitely a functioning alcoholic I guess. I'm a neat freak so my house and truck are always clean, my landscaping is always top notch, I take very good care of myself, my kids are always well dressed and groomed so on and so forth. I think that may even contribute to this struggle because I know from the outside looking in everyone who knows me thinks of me as a guy who really has his shit together and for the most part I do...I just have this one demon that I can't seem to shake and it's really fucking aggravating.

Not getting out during the pandemic was helpful while sobering up. Now Im in the world again I was afraid to face former drinking friends. This group is ALL about drinking, functional (maybe I dont really think so anymore but have jobs lol) but ""every night and all weekend"" kind of crowd.

What I learned was that DRINKING CAUSES ME MORE STRESS AND ANXIETY AT PARTIES THAN NOT DRINKING DOES. I was shocked. The background voices were all gone - am I talking too much / little? Am I getting too drunk? Not drunk enough? Where can I find drinks? Where will I drink after this? What am I saying? Can I do \_\_\_\_ without looking too f\*\*\*\*\* up? All of that was gone. It was transformational. I felt incredibly free. 

Yes, I do have a little social anxiety. I get nervous around crowds and new people. But I can easily handle it, and just as in Alcohol Explained, the feeling passes and you can have fun - no alcohol involved - even with a new group of people. I never thought this could be me.

Quick background since this is the first time posting since finding this sub - Bipolar/schizophrenic (not self diagnosed - been to the looney bin lol), wife left 3 years ago due to drinking, lost my job in April due to drinking, drank to a .344 BAC and smashed into a tree a week into having no job, spent a month in the hospital from extensive life threatening injuries, met my girlfriend while in the hospital, relapsed on July 7th, landed a new better systems engineer job (so thankful I didn't destroy my entire career) and finally (I hope) committed completely to staying sober.

I am just not sure why today seems to be the roughest so far.  This is the longest I have been sober for 20 years.  I didn't have a bad day at work.  Not great but not bad.  My girlfriend is on a trip with her brother so of course I miss her and it is really quiet in the house.  Just the dog, snake and me.  My meds have been working exceptionally well since cutting the alcohol out.  Had an alright phone call with my girl a bit ago but she didn't really have time to talk which is totally understandable since she is on vacation and having fun.  I am used to manic and depressive cycles and adjust meds accordingly so I know for a fact that is not the issue.  It was just when I walked through the door of the house the 'fuck it' feeling hit me like a Mack truck.  Didn't order alcohol and thankfully it is 25 minutes until the liquor stores close here so I figured I would vent, I guess, on here while the clock ticks down preventing me from doing something stupid.  Things have completely turned around from April and I am in a good place.  But for some reason, it crept in tonight.  Just a feeling of wanting to get obliterated as a sort of reset button to get to tomorrow.  Anyways, thanks for reading and letting me ramble for a bit.  I will leave you with a quote that came to mind this evening:

It's crazy how fast we return to our old ways.  I'm writing this to remind you how much it sucks to sober up. I will update throughout the week. (Note this is a binge of approx 4 months of around 10 drinks a day usually high strength beer and/or whiskey).

Day 1- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  Did I say nausea? Omg. Headache poor sleep etc. And the WORST feelings of shame and regret.  Reliving all of the stupid crap I did while drinking.  The people I hurt, the things I said... the friendships and relationships lost.

Day 2 - same as day 1, some energy returning after 48 hours... I left my room today.  Still diarrhea (consisting of bile).  No longer dry heaving.  I can't even answer my phone I am so antisocial.  I called in to work today after tossing and turning allllll night with hallucinations.  I have never had hallucinations from quitting cold turkey so it may have been the cocktail of medications I took to try and knock myself out from the restlessness.

Edit: While I didn't keep up on the daily updates... I did make it through a week.  I even had a birthday and didn't drink! I am starting to feel a lot better.  BMs aren't yet back to normal, still some aches and pains... I'm taking tylenol everyday when normally I would take it like twice a year.  My appetite is returning... even the depression is starting to lift a bit.  A bit.  I am still feeling some deep remorse for my past actions and there are many people that still aren't ready to forgive me. Some that never will.  I had enough energy to go on a date and for the first time in 7 dates I got a 2nd and 3rd date out of it.  I attribute this to being sober for the date.
I also made myself a schedule to hit two counseling appointments and 2 AA meetings a week.  Hopefully I go to the AA meetings.  I will certainly do the counseling.  Anyway.  Slowly the confidence and energy is returning.  Onwards and upwards my fellow ex drinkers.  It is going to get better.  It's going to get SO much better.

I remember waking up not wanting to drink, but then as soon as my SO went to work I'd take my two shots. Or I'd wake up before them and take a shot so I could be happy while preparing their lunch. I remember promising to myself and everyone it would be for the last time, only to fucking drink later that night or even within the next two hours. I remember being constantly intoxicated. I even had an app so I knew when I could drive based on my weight and blood alcohol level. Guess what? I even got to where I would use the app to know when I needed to re-up. I remember hiding alcohol in little spots all over the house cabinets, under the bed, behind the fridge, in the couch, outside in the bushes, and even in the pet beds. I remember ""going for a walk"" only to go to the gas station to buy a tall boy. I remember buying alcohol daily after work and chugging it around the corner from the house. I remember absolutely hating the taste of liquor, but still drank it hot everytime my SO left the living room or went to the bathroom. I remember measuring out two ounces because that was the smallest amount I could get down to. I remember trying to stop so many times. I remember not being able to write down job leads because my hand was shaking from withdrawals. I remember hating myself and my life, but couldn't figure out why I was so miserable and unhappy. I remember finally realizing that I was being abusive and as someone who has been abused, it was heartbreaking knowing all the pain I was causing. I remember regretting the things I had said or done while black out drunk. I remember the awful feeling the next morning when you have absolutely no memory of the night before. I remember thinking that there are tons of people who drink daily, and this was normal. I remember wanting to die and being so desperate, but still couldn't figure out what was causing all of this pain. I remember it all! 

Do I still have problems? Yes. Is my life perfect? No. Do I still struggle with mental illness and two other major diagnosises? Yes.

 How did I do it? Honestly I was so broken and beat down that my agnostic shithead self that sucks all organized religion I drug my ass down to the local AA  meeting at 3:00pm in the fucking bible belt. Thank God for the other chairperson was agnostic and spoke to me and said that religion won't save you, only yourself and these steps will. I struggled with it a lot especially in the beginning. I was so mad, hurt, and just frustrated. I had been trying to get soberish for over a year. While I don't agree with everything in AA I am so thankful I gave it a chance because there is no way I could do this alone. The great thing about the program and the literature is that is open to your own interpretation. Your truth will never be the same as someone else, but look for the similarities, not the difference.

I've posted here a couple of times in the past but unfortunately have a new (and mortifying!) story to tell.

On Saturday just gone, my (now ex) friend and I went to a bottomless processo brunch, whereby you drink as much prosecco as you can in two hours and then have accompanying food.

Well, it got as messy as it sounds. After a couple of hours and moving on from the first bar I became abusive to my friend, smashed a glass, asked the barman for his number (I have a bf), got thrown out of said bar and then apparently became so aggressive to my friend that random people tried to 'save' her from me.

We then proceeded onto another club and I apparently continued to be 'vile'.

My question is... How do I deal with the guilt, embarrassment and shame?

In the end, I'm not sad I've lost her as a friend as I had my own unaired grievances with her (which, I assume, just all came out when I was drunk), but I am ashamed that I was so uncharacteristically horrid, uncontrollably drunk and hit on a random barman (my bf and I have also been going through some issues etc.)

I've been drinking for about 12 years heavily. I knew I wasn't like other drinkers almost instantly. I wanted more, I wanted endless amounts. I drank and I felt like I could be anyone, talk to anyone, I could do anything, and I was finally the ""me"" that I was supposed to be. I was 16 when I started heavily. Typically an introvert, alcohol was my best friend that helped me in the moments I had to be social. I can't explain what else it did for me. It's like everything I did was boring and mundane, so it only made the most sense to drink. Everything I experienced could be amplified by liquor. I felt wonder, joy,and curiosity when I drank back then. The trees looked amazing, relationship barriers crumbled away and I could connect with anyone, words would flow, my poetry would spew everywhere if I chose to do it. I remember waiting for the clench in my gut after a few gulps of straight vodka, then the blue warmth, and then the high. Yes it's a high for me. Once it hits I am the me I always thought I should be. But it's short lived. Like all love affairs this one came to a roaring halt by 19. By that point, I was downing liters of vodka a night on car rides out to the city to meet up with my ""boyfriend"". You'd think I would pass out or die from that much consumption In a one hour time span, but nope. I'd be standing on my own two feet fooling and everyone who was just getting started. Of course, there were nights when I fooled no one. But my affection for alcohol perplexed most people my age because they didn't have this demon. I met my daughter's father in the midst of a 2 month long bender, and lord knows he saved my life. I went from drinking 1.75 of vodka a day, to staying sober and spending my days hanging with him skateboarding and going to museums and sitting talking over movies for hours on end. I soon became pregnant with our now 5 year old daughter. I was just thrilled to become a mother. I was in love. And I was putting those ""weird"" days behind me. The longest I've been sober was during my 9 month pregnancy. I had a healthy and beautiful baby girl in June. I was sober and never even dreamed of drinking because I was a busy new mom. But by the time baby girl was 3 months old, I was stressed out. I was convinced that I needed a glass of ""mom wine."" I figured since my love affair with vodka had ended I could start something new and less intense. Well, the beer and wine consumption was no different. I just needed more of it. I was in control for a few years,until one day I wasnt. I went to rehab 3 years ago and came out feeling like a new human being. Realizing I barely remembered age 16-19. Realizing my heroin addict ex who would beat me didn't actually love me. Wow. A lot to come to terms with the fact that the one person you'd die for would rather die than be yours. I stayed sober 60 days. Then fell victim to a new relationship and a new Outlook that I could somehow be an occasional drinker as long as I had productivity on my side. So hello cocaine! Hello amphetamine! I quickly spiraled with a bottle in hand, and now a baggie in the other. Funny because if you asked me to choose I would cradle that bottle like a newborn baby. I went to treatment again. 45 days. I was again reborn. But soon after I was back on amphetamines and I needed something to come down with when I got too high. So alcohol waltzed back into the room with revenge on her mind. From there I deteriorated. I went through psychosis, I never knew what I wanted or what was real, and I was miserable without alcohol. I felt ruined. I went to treatment a third time and this time I didn't even fucking want to go. I hated every second. I looked for mouthwash or hand sanitizer like a drug dog would look for heroin. I got out and pretended to be fine. But deep inside something was wrong and I knew I had crossed over. Soon after starting at sober living, I got into a fight with my boyfriend,and drank mouthwash. The following week, four Loko. Then within 2 months I was kicked out and back on methamphetamine. I want to share with you that I am in the grips of addiction as I type in this post. 2 weeks after being kicked out of sober living I went on a bender and missed my dearest girls first day of kindergarten. I went to the ER 3 times that week because I was convinced that I was dying. My mom picked me up off th streets and took me home. I'm week 2 into sobriety from alcohol, and I'm totally fine. Except that I found enough pain killers and benzos to kill a stampede of horses. I'm in misery today. I feel helpless. I know where my mom is hiding alcohol. I'm scared of myself, and this is the only place I know I can go without having to talk someon s ear off or be raced away to a treatment center to ""prevent"" a relapse. Please God tell me that this goes away someday, I am so hopeless I feel. Even when I stop I fucking MISS it. I feel better but I crave something more. I think I'm permanently defective and I want to die sometimes. Yet I'm afraid to live.",13,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4263228}"

I'm interested in and actively researching the use of guided plant medicine, or other psychadelic modalities, as a way to access then heal the deep core issues that compel me to destroy myself. Talk therapy is good but it keeps me in my brain too much. I have been on several ayahuasca journeys in an effort to access my core self, but they were done without the support of a skilled coach and a continued like-minded community. I'm gathering resources in my area in order to continue this path in a more organized manner. I feel very fortunate that this mode of exploration and healing  opportunities (in the U.S.) is on the cusp of being an acceptable, and not illegal, avenue to address mental health and addiction issues.

I'm on day 8 with no alcohol and feeling pretty good, but I KNOW that voice is biding its time just waiting to tell me to ""fuck it!""

I‚Äôd had set the alarm well in advance of the day - so much in advance that when my alarm went off, I ignored it and went ahead putting my young kids down for bed. 

3 years have passed since I had a drink. I wish I had the words to express how drastically better my life has been since I quit. I‚Äôll try: 

My job: I quit my miserable job in Conservative politics 2.5 years ago and am now making more and working from home pretty much indefinitely (I was never that conservative and to begin with so no love lost - just wasted time). I love my new, non-political job so much and I love not hating myself for doing something that wasn‚Äôt me. 

My family: Since quitting the poison that was slowly killing me and making the lives around me miserable, we have had another kid! Something that my wife now says wouldn‚Äôt have been in the cards if I was still on the sauce. One thing is very clear: The cycle of alcohol abuse passed down from generations stops with me. They may have the gene to watch out for - but my kids will never know what it‚Äôs like to grow up in a home with a drunk. 

My body: I lost 50 lbs and found a passion in running. Cliche as it may be, it‚Äôs a tremendous stress reliever and makes me happy and confident beyond my wildest dreams. 

Success: Quitting alcohol gave me clarity on the sense that I couldn‚Äôt hide from my problems anymore - I had to face them. And in facing them, I solved them. I got out of my own way. I learned and triumphed in humility and improving myself. I‚Äôve got a ways to go but the truth you find when you cut off the bullshit blanket of booze you drape over yourself to shut out reality - man, oh man, it forces you to confront your issues. 

With time, you see it all so simply. 

I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the innumerable ways quitting alcohol has made me a better man, husband, friend, father, and employee. And its with a little guilt I even post this - as I rarely check in with this sub anymore. I love you all and champion you all every time someone asks about what helped me quit. 

In truth, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm growing. Alcohol isn‚Äôt in my life anymore so I don‚Äôt feel the need to check in and remind myself as much. I‚Äôve moved on to live my life with booze in my rear view. I know I can‚Äôt ever fully turn my back on it or forget how all of my progress can be lost if I pick up the bottle again. 

But I concentrate on today and the now, and I wish you all the best of luck on your journey. Find the peace I have. Find the love you deserve. Find the clarity and the success and the wisdom to walk through life humble and thankful for what you have been through.

I am not too proud to admit that I have abused alcohol for the past year and few months, partly due to personal reasons (deaths in the family, emotional abuse from close friends, being cheated on) and partly due to pandemic-induced loneliness (living in a different country, away from friends and family). To begin with, I am an introvert with slightly anti-social tendencies. All of the above reasons were not a great recipe for success. So, I took the easy way out, i.e., forgetting all my troubles with alcoholism.  It started out only during the weekends, but then it slowly crept up into weekdays as well. It was great and all in the beginning, but I have been noticing lately that it's adversely impacting my physical and mental health. I didn't enjoy being sober anymore and anything less than a couple of beers is a slow day and anything less than 4 beers is a bad weekend. After speaking with a friend, I was jolted back into the reality that I have become a quintessential alcoholic. I am not having energy and concentration levels as before. I have become lethargic, am not interested in having longer conversations, missing my deadlines, and not being productive at work. Developed what is termed as man-boobs, because of all those extra calories, am in the worst possible shape of my life. I want to get back to my past self, where I had a lot of energy, achieving things, higher concentration levels, and better fitness. I miss my past self. I want to desperately get back to what I was a year ago. 

I am too embarrassed to talk about this to my family and other friends. But I want to have an accountability mechanism. That's the reason why I chose to be accountable here on Reddit to complete strangers. Since one thing that is really really important to me is to not let someone down, be it a close friend, a parent, sibling, or a total stranger on the internet. 

This is day 1 of the journey after making this resolution to quit drinking alcohol. I would want to come back to this post every day and update my journey, so it might be of some use for future netizens who are facing similar challenges in life and hopefully be fully sober someday.",15,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.69959176}"

You know you have a problem. When will enough be enough? ‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs that? You don‚Äôt know? Okay, let‚Äôs go to the highlights and review, and ask if that was enough:

The woman you married when you were 24 asked on your wedding night if you were going to slow your roll on the drinking since you weren‚Äôt in college anymore. You said of course, it‚Äôs time to grow up. She trusts you. You spend a beautiful week on a tropical island, meet great honeymoon friends that you still keep in touch with, spend all day on the beach and all night having fun and taking in the evenings on the balcony of your villa. You didn‚Äôt drink that much on your honeymoon. The last night you‚Äôre there, you get hammered drunk in the casino and come back to the room at 3am. You wake up in the morning feeling awful. She asks what‚Äôs wrong. You lied and said you think you got food poisoning from the restaurant last night. She takes care of you, gives you Advil and checks on you all morning until your ‚Äúfood poisoning‚Äù miraculously goes away after burning the afternoon away that could have been spent soaking up the sun with your wife. You get away with the first lie to your wife you‚Äôve ever told her. Was that enough? Nope.

Let‚Äôs fast forward 3 years. You are on a family vacation. You decide to start drinking at 12pm by the pool. You pledge to yourself and your wife that you‚Äôre only drinking beer. Fast forward to that evening. You are sitting at the kitchen table with your sister in law, and she likes Jim Beam. You begin to take shots. Fast forward to the next morning. You wake up, feeling the most hung over you have ever been. Your wife and mother are standing there. Your wife is crying. She proceeds to tell you that you began to throw up in your sleep. If she hadn‚Äôt have been there, you would have asphyxiated on your vomit. She had reason to switch rooms; you were snoring so loud that you were shaking windows. But she didn‚Äôt. She was worried at this point. You spend the next day and a half apologizing, pledging that you would never drink again. Was that enough? Not even close. You didn‚Äôt drink for the rest of the year, but eventually relapsed and while only drinking beer, you still tied on one frequently, trying to downplay it for 2 years.

Fast forward to June of this year. Your now ex wife got up one night and left in January saying little to nothing to you, but you know the majority of the reason why she left. You are sitting in the half empty house of your dreams, the one that you and her bought a year after getting married. You have gone on and off binges, quitting, therapy for the trauma of the divorce. What‚Äôs in your freezer? Vodka. It‚Äôs cheaper than beer, and you like to make cranberry and vodkas. You have a couple, and decide to go to a bar a few minutes away to meet up with a friend. You leave the bar, run up on a curb, and the next thing you know, you‚Äôre sitting in jail charged with your first crime ever, a DUI. Tell me, was that enough? I guess not, buddy.

Since then, you have continued to drink on and off. Just tell me, when will it be enough? When will you stop? You haven‚Äôt drank in 36 hours. Why not start now? Keep going. Use this group and other resources at your disposal.

I am trying to be a better person and sober as much for myself as anyone else,  and I know part of that is forgiveness and letting go of resentment. I have two people I still hold a great deal of resentment towards.

One is someone who hurt me, refused to take responsibility for it and explain,  and then later perished. So now there isn't a person I see every day, just an idea of someone I know I really am not supposed to be mad at. I can say the words ""I forgive you, "" and accept that what happened was likely just as much a result of my spiritual sickness as hers, but that doesn't make the anger go away. Sometimes I still catch myself spiraling into self pity and anger, vowing not to trust or be close to people because of that experience.  Ultimately I'm not really mad at her-- she certainly didn't deserve to die so suddenly sadly,  and had many good qualities.  Now I just feel with this cloud of hurt and anger inside me. Is it enough just to say you forgive someone and then try to catch yourself being petty and angry before it spirals out of control? Is there some reason I am having such trouble with this?

Another person I need to forgive is a parent who is, at least in my not-a-psychologist opinion, incredibly abusive and toxic.  Always blaming,  lying, denying,  playing the victim.  She still tries to hit me and my siblings sometimes even though we are adults. Because she is my mother I see her and remain in contact with her, and have spent years trying to reconcile her treatment of me with my behavior,  trying to see what I did to make our relationship so toxic.  I finally came to the conclusion it was not my fault,  and with that came years worth of pent-up anger. I have tried to forgive,  again praying and saying aloud 'I forgive you' and trying to move on. But the next time we speak,  the same upsetting behaviors rear their heads and I'm back in full blown hatred mode for days after.  That leads to drinking without fail,  and I can't drink anymore.  


There is definitely a deep anger in me, which is causing more harm to me than anyone else. I humbly ask for your advice.  I don't want to live like this anymore.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7412371}"

I'm a high functioning alcoholic as I've been able to have a successful electrical contracting career through this. I have 2 children and a wife. This past summer I can see how much it has affected my home life. I'm no longer a good father or husband. I attempted to hide alcohol from my wife for years in the house after she has repeatedly told me if I want to get drunk just drink in front of her, I've been embarrassed by this so I would hide liquor and beer in the basement or my shed. She would always find it and that would be worse then just drinking in front of her. 
    Eight months ago I watched as my younger brother (we were both adopted from different families as baby's) passed away from cirrhosis of the liver from drinking. This did not stop my drinking, if anything it fueled it.

I am not sure why I waited so long to post here but I guess today was the day. When I was on the fence this is one of the places I came for some.... Answers? Advice? Proof that I was (or wasn't) an alcoholic? I am not really sure. All I know is I was looking down the barrel. I knew the way I was living was not sustainable. I was unhappy, depressed and scared. I didn't know what to do. I knew for a very long time that the way I drank wasn't healthy or normal. The truth is the alternative didn't sound any better. I was scared all the time. I had anxiety, self hatred and self pity out the wazoo. The only thing I had was alcohol. I couldn't fathom having that taken away. Then a miracle happened. I hit my bottom. Got in trouble at work one too many times then went to rehab to save that and when I got home was immediately arrested for DWI. My wife kicked me out, I was positive I lost my job, I had no license and I hated my self. From that came the realization that if I wanted to live I had to try something new. Most of all I had to admit that I didn't have answers and that I needed to listen to others. My journey involved a lot of different groups and people but the thing that made it possible for me was the idea of one day at a time. Just don't drink today. No matter what just make it through today. With that also comes the fact that you only have today. You cant change yesterday. My past actions don't go away and I need to face the consequences for my actions BUT I cant change it. It happened. I need to live for 24 hours at a time and do my best. I also can't predict the future. I found that if I just do my best for 24 hours, don't drink and do the right thing my past actions don't sting as much. They don't have the power they once did. The future is bright. I believe that is from doing the best I can for one day at a time. I had a long journey and I just had my license reinstated. My wife took me back and we are stronger than ever. I was able to keep my job and I am thriving. My friends and family look at me in a different light. My father has said multiple times that I am like a different person (I believe that's because I am). My wife and I are even trying for a baby now. That is something that I couldn't imagine just two years ago. All of these blessing don't come close to one gift I have been given in sobriety: I am happy. I never thought I could live a life with out alcohol. A bottle of vodka at the end of the day was all I had to look forward to for a very long time. I don't need that anymore. I am grateful for my life now. It will not always be sunshine and rainbows but that's okay. Because no matter what happens I learned in the past 20 months that I will survive. I will be okay. Before, I was a lurker on this sub and I thought you were all full of shit, but in the back of my mind I prayed you weren't. Now I am one of the ones saying life is good. Thank god I was wrong.

I am reading Somerset Maugham again, mostly because it's easy to get his stuff from the library to be honest. I had read *Of Human Bondage* back at the first of the year and it made a huge impression on me. I still think about that book a lot. But I heard that his other works didn't hold up like that one did so was in no rush to read everything but now I seem to be back to him. Going only on ancient English degree and the reading of 2 of his other novels now, I will confirm that. *Of Human Bondage* is very much of its time and place but the characters and themes are universal. Last week I read *Up at the Villa* and *The Moon and Sixpence* and enjoyed them enough but certainly won't be thinking about them a year from now. Situations and attitudes in those that would never happen now and selfish, disagreeable characters who may have been intriguing antiheros to readers 100 years ago but are just shockingly horrible people by today's standards whose redeeming qualities really don't go far and aren't relatable. Lots of consequence-free, romanticized heavy drinking in both of those too. Always an eye roller. If you've ever read his work and have a recommendation I'd love to hear it. I do like his prose style. And the price of the books, lol.

I have not been a heavy drinker for long. I used to drink a few beers when I went out with friends or went away on trips. But ever since I moved in with a few friends who drink heavily, I started doing the same.

In fact, none of us drink heavily without others, but when we all have a party (which is pretty much twice or thrice a week) we push each other to drink more (especially during semester breaks).  
For the past year and a half, I have been drinking heavily almost every weekend (by heavy, I mean 15 - 20 drinks a night). 

For the past 2 weeks, I have been intermittent fasting, eating extremely healthy, and have given up drinking. My housemates are not thrilled that I'm no longer partying every weekend with them.

I had to tell this to someone as all my friends' circles drink I'm sure some of my friends will be happy that I'm getting healthy, but nobody is going to be as thrilled about it as I am now, so I thought of posting here and telling people with a similar mindset.",744,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.47619286}"

I was drinking fifths of vodka every night. I have thousands of failed attempts however this time it not only seems to have stuck but it wasn't even that difficult. What happened was one night I drank way more than I intended and woke up with a 5 alarm hangover. I started squirming around, thinking really dark thoughts and whatnot, the usual, and it hit me there's no reason I have to keep putting myself through this. Over the next couple days I broke down not why I think I drink but why I really drank and the conclusion I drew was the whole process is absurd. Drinking isn't a demon in a bottle or some complicated issue it's just ethanol, an addictive and toxic drug that acts kinda like an anesthetic, and I only drink to avoid the withdrawal from the same drug which ironically makes me feel even sicker than the withdrawal will. Every thought and belief about why I couldn't stop breaks down against reasoning as lies to distract from that simple reality. The actual state of intoxication while it generates a state of mild euphoria isn't even that pleasurable. Certainly not pleasurable enough to be worth the trouble. It's familiar and boring and I've had much better highs in my life and I don't crave those drugs because I never did them enough to develop a physical dependency or tolerance to them. So the only thing really latching me to the habit of drinking was physical dependency and the rest was pure delusion. Realizing there's nothing to fear from the withdrawal I just went through it. It was a one week mild flu, I could do that standing on my head being so well practiced at functioning with a hangover. Now having that behind me the thought of spending a night drunk or even taking a drink has lost its allure. I really for the first time in years simply don't want it. All I have to do is remember and I don't have to white knuckle a craving it simply goes away. We're logical creatures for a reason. I think that's the secret. It only has to be as difficult as I make it and quitting isn't a burden it's letting one go. It's just ethanol, that's it. Nothing more.

I'm tired of the effects it has on my mental health as I already have depression and anxiety. (2 ED's to top it off which isn't helpful in the throw up aspect of getting drunk). 

I'll spend my weekend out and then regret it when I sober up and am hungover, that's when I'm super like... I don't wanna drink anymore, did I bring my stuff home last night, How many cigarettes did i smoke, who did I speak to last night.. oh gosh, where's my phone and who did I ring and text.... All of them make me spiral into an anxiety so high that I just lay in bed and I almost feel paralysed. 

Once that hungover day is over I spend the week in my head constantly telling myself that I need to stop drinking but then that voice get's quieter and quieter as the week continues and then it comes back to the weekend and I am now fully convinced ""I just won't drink as much"".... Then that fails... It just goes on and on and on.... 

Problem remains the plans that i've made, such an easy excuse to continue to drink but I don't want anyone knowing I'm wanting to be off the drink. I have a festival next weekend to which I brought the tickets (weren't cheap) and I got them for a friends birthday so I could have just sold the ticket and said no to going but If I do that then Im bailing on my friends birthday..... I also have scotland the following weekend and the point of me going was to have a ""party"" Kind of weekend away with pals... So then In my head Im like... I'll give up once Scotland is over, but what a cop out that I'm waiting until I don't have plans.... 

I dunno, feel kind of shitty about it but then also want no one to know.... Feel like I need not only a break from this drink but I need one from everyone. Sucks balls that the only invitation I get to ever meet friends Is when drink is involved, I've developed an unhealthy relationship with it and its ever since Covid Sprouted.... before I was able to drink socially very well and I knew when to stop.

I‚Äôm starting my 4th day here. The night was better than the previous one, although still not great but what are dark circles compared to psoriasis, red face, leathered skin or awful morning breath?

I had a fight with the lizard yesterday after work : I sat down in my car for a good ten minutes, witnessing two ‚Äúentities‚Äù in my brain having a brawl. The lizard wanted me to stop by the liquor store, whilst my normal side just wanted to go home and relax.

I have no idea how the normal side won, but I finally drove back home like a zombie and found myself drinking a tea at 6:30 instead of my normal fifth of rum. I couldn‚Äôt say what made me turn down the ‚Äúappeal‚Äù of getting completely plastered as usual, but hey, a win is a win.

Would you believe it, I even brush my teeth last night : I know that sounds ridiculous (and a tad disgusting), but if I brush my teeth every morning, I don‚Äôt normally do it before bed as I am most of the time comatose in my bed by 10. Weird feeling. Good feeling.

2 decades later, I couldn't even enjoy the dancing and singing with drinks anymore.

Good day everyone and happy Tuesday!!  I hope this finds you well.  Yesterday we talked about misconceptions you may have had when quitting the drink but what is your WHY to stop drinking?? Let‚Äôs face it, I don‚Äôt think many of us woke up one morning and said out of the clear blue ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to stop drinking today‚Äù and successfully did so right off the bat. Chances are, you had been thinking about wanting to stop, perhaps you even tried a time or two (or countless times like me). The thing that helps you succeed with not drinking is having a WHY. WHY did you want to stop? For me, it was for my physical and mental health. It was for ME, to better MY life. I was a bloated, dehydrated, exhausted mess and shell of a person. I fought constantly with myself over drinking. My brain was constantly consumed with guilt, remorse, unhappiness, and despair. I was becoming a disaster.  I had completely lost my ""shine"".  Physically, my throat was hurting all the time and I started getting stomach aches. I was constantly tired, unable to focus, and just felt like complete crap. I knew I had to quit if I was ever going to be happy again. And guess what?? It worked! I‚Äôve lost weight, I‚Äôm sleeping better, I feel 100% better overall than I ever have, and I‚Äôm genuinely happy!  **So, if you feel like sharing, what is your WHY to finally put down the bottle and start living a sober and healthier life??**

I might not be drinking everyday, but I'm drinking enough where it's impacting my life in a negative way. These gaps of time I have lost, whether it be literally from being so drunk I'm blacking out, or the hangovers that sign me up for us unproductivity and shit eating, is taking a toll in my quality life. How do I convince myself this is fun? Is this ""fun"" worth the stupid shit I get myself into or the physical pain the next day or even days after? Wtf am I chasing? What lie do I keep believing that this normal and okay? My body fucking hurts after this weekend of booze. In a way where I'm actually concerned. I'm 28. I'm a mom. And this is not the life I should be in. This is immature and sick.

 I hate alcohol for convincing me that there's no fun without it, and that it's how to fit in. My body hates me today, I'm getting chubby and the light in my face feels dimmed, my eyes look tired. I look half dead and I feel like I have been living half dead. It's a pathetic and dreadful lifestyle. I'm over not remembering and hurting myself. I'm over the weird social pressure I put on myself that drinking is the only way to meet people. I'm over allowing myself to slip out of awareness to numb feelings. I'm tired of being embarrassed over preventable actions if I was in a sober state of mind. I'm over thinking that my free time that I get away with my son I translate as a time to party. I can't help but wonder how much time and potential I have wasted. I am simultaneously bummed and grateful. My guardian angels (I'm not even religious but I feel I owe some credit cosmically because I'm baffled at times that I'm actually alive) bestowed me yet another chance to live and make better decisions. It's really fucken awesome I'm not dead. It's really great to have these feelings of actually wanting to change. In the meantime, I'm gonna drink some water and throw out these dumbass cigarettes and heal up. Mentally. Spiritually. I will practice gratitude in these feelings of defeat and just feeling like a loser. I have hope.

Alcohol being overrated is an understatement. It's a weapon against humanity. Not always but, as I reflect, it truly has affected my development. It's tricky when you're a weekend drinker. You don't think it's a time consuming activity. You don't think it's bad because it's not everyday. But I have been a weekend drinker since I was 15, it adds up to substantial time lost. The cycle will ruin me, it is proving itself in real time. It has for a long time but I didn't have the courage to see it..

On June 30th, my Dad was found in his bed. 6'4"" 120 pounds, found by his friend from work whose sister is dying from cancer. His appartment was fucked in ways I am uncomfortable describing. I had to clean it out.
Despite the vodka bottles filled with brown piss, the smell and the circumstances I cannot stop drinking. 
I saw him quite a bit in the weeks before he died. It was fucked. I couldn't drive him to get his favorite rack of ribs because of a DWI I had a year before. So when we went he was drunk, driving his car, and he asked me to pick him up a bottle of Smirnoff. 

I declined. 

He yelled and asked me why. I apologized. I am one to talk.
We ate ribs that night. ""Eating like kings and queens"" he always said since I was just a kiddo. He couldnt eat much.
He couldnt stay up past 5 because he was dying. I wanted to take a shot from his vodka bottle but I didn't. I cleaned his guitars and took out his trash and I ubered home.


A month later my uncles and aunts poured a smirnoff vodka shooter on his grave.

I¬¥ve been trying to stop - stayed sober for 2 days then relapsed, drank only 4 cans of beer or so, but having major anxiety today. I know I don't wanna drink again but my brain is always working against me.

Besides quitting alcohol (which is the n.1 priority for me now and I \*rationally\* know it), I'm trying to lose weight, do cardio 4x a week, cook my own food everyday and if one of these elements fall apart, the cravings for alcohol get crazy (additionally, I'm grieving the death of my mother, who died from covid one a  half month ago). I always have a hard time working on the ""all or nothing"" mindset.

Has anyone else have/had the same problem? I try to put in my head that it doesn't matter so much if I fail a bit in other areas at this beginning, as long as I stay away from alcohol, but it¬¥s hard.

For example: right now, in my city, it is super dry and I'm having headaches and low energy, as It always happens with me with this type of weather. But it was supposed to be ""the exercising hour"", so I'm already feeling like shit.

And then 1 month. Posting here so someone knows I guess.,"Long story short - I replaced my addiction of smoking daily weed 3-4 times a day for almost 5 years with drinking myself to sleep. Great idea, right!?

It worked technically. I haven't smoked weed in almost 6 months and don't even feel tempted by it. I also quit cigarettes early last year. But drinking is fucking me up. I have a history of alcoholism in my family and don't want to let this drinking problem destroy me, my life right now, and any family I might have in the future. 26M right now.

For the past 5/6-ish months I've been drinking beer non stop. I'm too scared to for harder booz though I've tried. I didn't have a job for 3 of those months and when I was low on cash, I chose to spend more money daily on less expensive but still potent alcohol than groceries. I risked making rent on times. I actually did pay rent 2 weeks late once because I had been spending money daily on 6-10 cans of tall beer cans. I'd wake up and say last night was the last one. No drinking tonight. Then come evening I'd start to get antsy and restless and run to closest beer store 10min before it's closing time hoping I will make it otherwise god knows what!

Then I got a job, WFH, and the drinking still continued. Then I started going to the office 3 weeks ago and I still come home with a new beer everyday and drink myself to sleep. So many I order food from the restaurants that will sell me a 6 pack with it. It goes up $50-$60 per meal sometimes where $35-$45 is the beer. Financially I'm closing to an alarmingly low state too. Again. I get no exercise. I eat 2 small meals in a full day and my beer gut grows and grooows. No social life. I drink alone. Friends I neglect. Sometimes I cancel plans with them to drink alone and watch TV shows cuz that's just so comforting. Like ewww. Drinking alone and watching Netflix has become my safe zone. I disgust myself. I disrespect myself. Especially cuz I've promised my mother several times over the course of my life that I will not go down this alcoholic man's route that traumatized her, our family, and our lives. But seems I've accepted that I've failed and kept drinking anyway.

Yesterday I didn't drink myself to sleep. Had 1/5 of a bottle wine with dinner and that was the last of my alcohol. I've had 1 or 2 sober days before but I always relapse.

I was doing online therapy for a couple reasons for 2 months but now since I've been spending so much money on booze I've had to stop that so that I can make rent and do other life things till the paychecks come in and get me back to a safe place money wise.

I know my addiction can be called an **""addiction""** cuz I know and have read how bad real long-term alcohol addiction can be like but I do feel addicted to it and rely on it so much. The feeling of buzz and light-headedness it provides in my already stressful life. Stress from not doing the things I should be doing and neglecting and being afraid of my responsibilities. I'm slowly failing at my DREAM job day-by-day and feel like everyday I'm closer to getting fired.

Anyways..

I just wanted to do something different this time and tell someone about it - like you guys. Today is my 2nd day of no drinking I hope I make it. My small goal is 2 weeks. Then a month. To eventually 4 months. And continue the streak. Mainly I guess I'm posting on reddit toA. do something different than always.B. As a reminderC. For accountability (I know it's anonymous so this doesn't really hold up but still. I have no one in real life I'd like to admit this to)D. For some advice and motivation.

I want to quit drinking and have a better life and make something of myself. I wanna be comfortably rich. Be an expert in something. I want to have a woman I love. Children I can be a good dad too. A man my friends and family can respect and can come to for help. None of that can happen if I keep indulging in awful fucking habits that destroy myself. And none of that can happen if I don't have any discipline. I, once again, say that I will try to improve myself and I really hope it's different this time.

I know this takes time and consistency. If I fail, I will not give up. I will try again. This is just one more try.

Thanks for reading this far. I teared up like 5 times writing this. Thanks guys! Wish me luck <3

TLDR - I (26M) have been drinking myself to sleep everynight for 6-ish months and destroying my life and yesterday I quit. Today is my 2nd day. I wanna go for a month without wasting money and energy on alcohol and drinking alone, sleeping, going to work. Drinking alone, sleeping...you get it. And drinking in day too during weekends.

2021-09-13 18:16:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pnpr87/looking_for_advice/,Looking for Advice...,"Hello everyone,

This is my first time posting here. I just need some advice and thought this would be a safe space to do so.

Last weekend on Saturday, a few of my best friends, my best friend's extended family, my partner, and mom were all having a cute little pool party and BBQ. I usually have a few drinks at events like this and it goes well, but once I get that feeling of being ""too confident"" about knowing my limits, everything goes downhill (in general, not only specifically for this one event).

My history with alcohol has been rocky since high school (18). I'm now 27. In my past, I've been quite violent verbally and non-verbally to friends. This scared the shit out of me, so I worked really hard to work on myself and that worked for a while. I realized which types of alcohol are best, when drinking is best for me, my limits, etc. but that was mostly in college (18 - 23 years old).

Post-college is a whole different ball game it feels like. I rarely drink now, but when I do it's when friends visit. The friends who came this last weekend were friends from college, so I feel like my mind sort of teleported back to those times. I drank so much and was not paying attention at all, ugh. I ended up passing out and missing a lot of the party and waking up very upset because I do not see these friends/fam often. I just feel like every time I drink a lot I feel sad like I missed out (well because I am because I can't remember everything).

I've been having a very hard time with the entire experience of forgetting things, memory, PTSD too because my dad passed away suddenly and recently. I feel I just want to live in the moment and be present and not forget things and enjoy myself. Like why do I have to be the one who has to count their drinks still when none of my friends do and everything ends up fine for them and they still have fun. I just wish I could find that balance and not have to be hyper-aware of my drinking all the time. It's exhausting. Some of you might say to just stop drinking then, but it's not that easy for me. I feel like a lot of solutions in life feel like ""all or nothing""....how do I know if that's what I need to do? I don't hurt people when I'm drunk anymore. I try to notice my emotions. I just wanna have a drink and not spiral into having 10 shots in an hour because my friends are doing it. My friends are all about 6 feet and over 160-180 pounds too. I'm 5 foot 3 inches and 130 pounds. I can't keep up with them and I know it, but I just don't understand why this whole drinking and not being mindful of how much I'm drinking happens, and then I just fall asleep. I don't feel like I HAVE to drink like I'm not out of control, but I am subconsciously? I'm not sure if I'm explaining this correctly though. Hopefully this makes sense.

Has anyone else felt any of these things? What did you all do?

I have been struggling with my drinking for a long time. Mostly internally. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone the real truth. And outwardly I don't think it appears to be a problem. Of course I've gotten drunker than I meant to, but not in a long time. Or at least not in public. I somehow manage to keep up the illusion that I'm a ""responsible drinker"", that I enjoy having just a few drinks, that I care about whether this wine is better than that wine, etc. 

But it's a lie, and I know it. The truth is, I never want just a few drinks. I'm able to keep it together in social settings because I know there is always more booze at home. Where no one can see. I won't start drinking unless I know I can keep drinking. Even if I only have one more, knowing it's there is like a security blanket. I'm 41 years old, and I need a security blanket.   

I'm not dependent on alcohol. I've never experienced serious consequences, I don't drink and drive, I've never been fired, and I drink less now than I did in my 20s and 30s, when binge drinking was just the fun thing to do every weekend. And so I convince myself that it's not a problem. Even though I know it is. Even though I know I'm sad, and lonely, and using booze to fill the void where lightness and joy should be. 

I'm not a complete mess. My life has not become unmanageable. But I'm also not really alive at all.

There's this scene in Augusten Burrough's book 'Dry' where a woman is telling her story at an AA meeting. She's just been diagnosed with breast cancer. And she's talking about how her drinking never really seemed that bad because nothing really bad had happened. But when she's diagnosed with cancer she realizes that's not true, something bad did happen. Time passed. 

That hit me hard.

I could probably continue on like this indefinitely. Riding the roller coaster of being sober for a week, maybe a month, thinking I can go back to drinking like a normal person, failing, hating myself, repeat. But I'm tired. And I want to get off this ride.

So to all you lovely internet strangers who may be struggling, I'm right there with you. And to those of you who are sober and thriving, I hope to be like you one day.

Im afraid that this is taking a toll on us, and i do feel some guilt.","I guess this is just some rambling/venting. It might get long-winded, and i'm not a native english-speaker, so im sorry if something sounds weird.

So yeah... This weekend me (27) and my S/O (28) was out for drinks with friends. It's all good by the time we decide to go home. When we get home, we decide that we should mellow it down with a glass of wine and some nice music before bed. She is smaller than me, so at this point i can tell that she is quite intoxicated while im just tired and ready for bed, so i decide to call it quits and go to bed.

About 4 hours later around 03.00 i get woken up by the ceiling light turned on and she is fumbling around in the bedroom. At this point she's very drunk, looking for her phone. She's crying a lot and i'm trying to get her to explain what the hell is going on, what happened since i went to bed etc. The next morning she gave me the full story. It turns out she kept at it, and with a lack of controlling her impulses, she goes back out into the night where she meet up with some other friends. At some point, an abusive family member she stopped talking to calls her up, and he's just as drunk as she is. He starts acting like the cruel POS he is, and the whole thing escalates to the point where he's threatening her, and she's pretty much on her way there, ready to see if he had the balls to back his words up. In the cab, she then decides that the trip is too far and she's getting tired and redirect the cab back home.

The last couple of days she's been ridden in anxiety and overall sadness. She is struggling with bipolar disorder and yeah.. this isn't the first ""impulse-incident"" like this, and im worried about her. We've talked a lot the last couple of days, and decided that we will not keep any alcohol at home anymore and that we need more structure. That i can't take seeing her like this, and that she can't take feeling like this anymore, and that none of us can take being this worried about what's gonna happen when we're just supposed to go out for some drinks. 

So, why do i feel guilty? Well, i feel like i may have been enabling it all. My antics in the past was very much that of a party animal. The year before covid and during covid i became more of a home-drinker, where I'd rather invite friends over for drinks and chill with some music rather than going out and such. With her diagnosis, i suppose i have been too fucking stupid to realize that she has a much harder time recovering from the hangover-anxiety, and that she might need more calm/structure in her life than i do to feel well. 

I feel like absolute shit for being a part in this breakdown she had when she woke up this saturday. She spent all day in bed, and i spent most of it there aswell trying to support her and be there for her as much as i could. I took some bathroom breaks where i just had to cry a little out of pure empathy and/or the fact that i might have been a part of all this. 

When it comes to cold, hard facts, she hasn't really done anything fucked up. She didnt make an ass of herself in the classical sense, she didnt destroy anything and she would never ever hurt anybody, as she is the nicest, cutest most wholesome person i've ever known, but i guess the feeling of losing control to that degree/inability to manage her impulses and putting herself in potential danger while drunk is getting to her bad.

As i said, she is the nicest person i know, and would never go fight someone ever. Im not sure what her intents were when she jumped into the cab, but maybe that's partly why she feels like this: the fact that she got so mad she made a full 180¬∞ and broke character that much.

We have a great relationship in all other aspects. We're not troublemakers or anything like that. We're interested in music, hiking in the wild, going to concerts/shows and she has a big interest in make-up/beauty with Dita von teese being her main role model. She's going to a support group this wednesday for others with the same diagnosis as her, and i'm supporting the hell out of it. I don't really know what i want to say with all this, but i somehow feel like a bad influence. 

To you who read all of this: thank you so much for listening. Not sure if im leaving this up for long, but right now i feel really vulnerable and just wanted to vent.

So I made my first post here last Monday and I‚Äôm still hanging tough. First weekend in the books. It feels good to have made it through an entire weekend with no drugs or alcohol. I really do feel better. I was able to cross a few things I needed to do off my list as well which is great. Not drinking makes the days longer but I‚Äôm trying to view that as an opportunity and not a burden to fight through. I was a little concerned today, sometimes when I start to feel too good about myself I get a little delusional and start to think I can handle anything. It‚Äôs funny, in my honest moments my life is something I‚Äôm not so proud of but after a few days of feeling good I can convince myself I‚Äôm really killing it. Anyways, work knocked me down a few pegs today and it‚Äôs a good thing. Sometimes my insecurity can be an asset. I hope everyone had a good weekend and if not I hope you are ready to start trying again. Good luck everybody.",11,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.777853}"

Anyway I actually found it incredibly useful it was a pivotal part of my life and I am forever grateful that such a program exists, that said it is a little overwhelming at first and it does require active maintenance in order for it to truly work, but after a while for whatever reason I just became disconnected with it all in the 6 years that I was sober my life changed dramatically I got married I had a son I'm very very happy with my life right now but that doesn't mean I don't suffer from my own shortcomings from time to time and even though I only slipped up last week if I'm completely honest I've really been a dry drunk white knuckling it for the last 2 to 3 years now and that is completely 100% my failing, I should have known better I should have reached out and ask for help as soon as I noticed my mental health declining but I was too proud and thought that I could continue ignoring my problems..

I was wrong, and while I could easily blame the stress of covid that's really only the straw that broke the camel's back and if it wasn't covid it would have been something else, I have an acute condition it's called alcoholism and if I don't manage it or deal with it in a proactive way it will catch up with me I have no say in that that's just what it's like I have kidney failure or something I have to get medicine I have to get help otherwise I will regress into my old ways, 6 years I was sober and within 3 days I was chugging back red and white wine at 8 in the morning at work.. fucking insane

So because I also injured myself I've managed to score a couple of weeks off work I've spent the last 4 days journalling everything that I'm going through making plans attending AA meetings and searching for a sponsor, in a weird way it feels kind of liberating like I've been holding on to this agony without really consciously being aware of it but I just wanted to put this out there because I know I'm not the only one this shit is really really hard and even though you can think you're fine unless you are taking inventory of your mental health on a regular basis and actively doing something about it if something is wrong you can end up hurting people that you love, I'm confident then I'm going to be ok because I'm throwing everything I've got it this right now in time I'm going to have to pace myself otherwise of burnout but it serves as a cautionary tale and I thought it might be useful for somebody out there, this is a wonderful community if you're struggling maybe even if you're not struggling just remember that we are all here and we all want to get better ‚úåÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è",44,{'covid': 2},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.3859884}"

It has not been 2 consecutive years, I had a couple months in between to try out ‚Äúmoderation‚Äù and we can imagine how that went üôÉ

But it‚Äôs still 2 full years and for that I‚Äôm really proud. I still feel like a toddler sometimes wobbling around sobriety. I don‚Äôt go to any meetings or programs, I do it largely by myself with books and media, so this online community has been really helpful in feeling less alone and I thank everyone for sharing and supporting. 

I don‚Äôt miss feeling drunk, but I do miss participating in the drinking culture. It has been a challenge to go from ‚Äòthe life of the party‚Äô to ‚Äòthe boring one‚Äô overnight. But I choose to continue on this path because the positive effects of sobriety bleeds into everything else in my life. 

The simple act of prioritizing my inner peace over participating in the dominant (and largely toxic) culture is a small act of rebellion that has really strengthened my sense of self. I put myself first now, not others opinion of me, and with this stability I feel ready to achieve my dreams. 

I read a quote from the Made in Chelsea cast member Caggie Dunlop (British tv personality) that goes 

‚ÄòThe negative effect drinking had on my mental health was so undeniable, it would be an act of self harm to continue‚Äô

I was cooking dinner and pulled out a glass bottle of soy sauce. The size and color of the bottle, the weight of it, the motion of my hand pulling it out‚Äîout of nowhere this just triggered me into thinking ‚Äúoh, wasn‚Äôt that fun? Wasn‚Äôt drinking a beer while cooking the best?‚Äù

Then I had to remind myself: yeah, the 1 beer while cooking was fun. The problem was, of course, 1 beer while cooking was always a really high alcohol IPA. It never stayed at 1. It always led to 3-4 and then usually wine with dinner and more later while watching TV and and and‚Ä¶

I work in a brewery, and we're allotted a certain amount of beer in the taproom every month + as many lowfills as you want.

I'm not especially worried about peer pressure (beer pressure?) from my coworkers, but I *am* a little worried about how I'll turn myself down. That whole ""I've worked my ass off today, I deserve a treat"" inner voice I know I'm gonna hear. 

Thankful that we've recently added (good!) non-alcoholic options in the taproom, or I feel like I'd be in real trouble. I really count on that after-shift socialization. Just gotta remind myself that a tasty sparkling water, good company, and not spending half of the next day recovering from a hangover (because inevitably I'd go home and have several more before bed) is a good enough 'treat' for a hard day's work. 

I know that temptation will ease some once my coworkers go from being shocked to being supportive, and I'm really looking forward to getting past that hurdle. After all, even though I know they wouldn't judge me either way, I gotta feed that inner demon that says they'll be disappointed if I give up. ;)

A little backstory first. I was a daily drinker (heavy) but  with some little help and a great will I was able to abstain from doing that shit.  Now, im facing another problem. I cannot for the life of me go over 30 days. Thats my maximum. I was able to break the daily cycle because I felt like shit everyday. Like sick, sick, you know?. Now, the fact that I broke that cycle got me some, lets call them perks. Healthier, the main one is good obviously. The bad one: my mind is working 100 %. This is bad cause of the bad thoughts, you know the drill , ""I wasted so much time and money on booze"", ""you lost so many good opportunities in life"", ""where are your friends?"". Lets not forget the classics : ""i'm too old now, is there a point in trying?"" ""You are never gonna find a job"" ""Your scholarship is useless now"". ""Everybody is so far ahead, but you"".etcetera, etcetera. etcetera.


Now, when those thoughts are at full power is when I ""reset"" myself.. Like all-the-liquour-store reset. A new beginning!.



I wake up. Start counting. ""That many!?""

Check the phone. Start typing.""Im sorry, [REDACTED], I didnt mean to say that yesterday!"" ""Were you drinking again?. I thought you said you were gonna stop."" ""...mmhh..."". Hey, thats a new crack.

Sore throat, new bruises and pain.

Then the flashes start. Some place far away from home. ""How in the hell did I arrive at home?"".  A memory of me cursing at innocent bystanders. Something, something, police something.

Never again, I promise (said no one ever)



Anyways, I just wanted to share something about me. It should help (I hope). And I wanted to ask you guys:

How to break the cycle? . Now, I know theres no ""ultimate"" answer or panacea. So, let me rephrase the question:
What are you little strategies to avoid the booze? How do you dodge the ""need"" of one beer? specially when you are in the sobriety state for so long. How do you distract yourself?
Anything you wanna share with me will do.

I really wanna break this cycle. I really do. I now I cant go back in time or act like nothing ever happened, but I now that if I stop completely my life will improve even if just a little.

At last, I have not had a drink in years...","It has been quite a journey, and I would be remiss if I did not thank this community for taking part in it alongside me. Over the last two years, and in the years before when I would quit for days, weeks, and months on end, I learned that there is no quick fix, no catch-all solution that can be applied to anyone battling their own addictions. I believe for each of us, we must find what fits, and piece together a toolkit that when combined and used effectively, can over time loosen the hold our chosen poison has on us. For me, I tried AA at first and counseling, and it didn't quite take on its own. But then I reached out to online groups, I found circles like this one, I read books and educated myself on the science and psychology behind what was happening inside of me, and never stopped trying no matter how many times I fell off the horse. Two years ago was maybe the hardest fall, though there had been rough ones before, and finally, this last attempt seems to have stuck.

I am aware that the fight never ends though, and while I feel more confident and happy with my sobriety today than ever before, I will always remain vigilant. That addict brain remains forever, deep in the recesses, whispering about moderation and returning to something ""normal"" and the need to hang out with people in the way that they hang out with each other. All of these murmurings are traps, ones that I believe I can now spot, but it is a crafty little monster, and so I will continue to take care when such thoughts arise.

As to what little advice I can offer from my own experience?

 \- Find what works for you. We all come from different backgrounds, with different perspectives and surprisingly different brain mechanics. Just like we all don't learn the same, we all don't confront addiction the same. For me information became key. One of the breakthrough tools for me was *This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace. I cannot recommend it enough. There's an associated podcast as well you can take with you in your daily life.

 \- Seek communities, both locally and online. As I said, I tried AA early and it really didn't work for me, but when I found groups like this online, suddenly something clicked. Find your circle.

 \- Be open and honest with those around you. Often they don't quite know what to say or how to approach you. ""Not drinking"" in general can be a hard concept to grasp, especially in a culture that glorifies it, and in families like mine that gravitate to big family events fueled by alcohol. Let them know it's ok to ask questions, let them know it's ok to drink around you (if this is true for you, it took me some time to be able to socialize again in this way). As hard as your journey is, you have to take it upon yourself to reach out.

 \- Accept that you will fall off that horse, again and again, face it, admit it, and never stop climbing back on

  \- Get help. If you don't have a strong support structure built into those around you, and if the knowledge gathering and communities aren't working, get to googling, and find professional help. I found a cheap pathway to a doctor that could prescribe me disulfiram, which once in your system makes you violently sick if you drink any alcohol. They say that everyone finds this out at least once firsthand. I was lucky, I never tested it and was already on this last sobriety attempt that I am on now, but it was a huge mental assist in knowing I could not physically enjoy alcohol. I also had someone watch me take it every day, either in person or via a video call.

 \- Grieve for the life that you lost. This was a big one for me. You have to go through the stages of grief for the reality you are leaving behind, because that is exactly what is happening. That lifestyle, that reality, that version of yourself has to die for your to be reborn in sobriety. It may sound dramatic, but until you accept that that version of you is gone, that you cannot go back, you will always be pulled backward by it. Accept that you are a person that does not drink. Acknowledge that there are things you loved to do that you simply cannot do anymore. Embrace the sober you and all the new and beautiful things that come with it.

That's my meandering ramble on this day, the 13th of September, two years since I began what I hope to be my final march into sobriety. Thanks again to all of you, to this community, to those who participate, to those who lurk, to those who share and voice their support alongside those who watch and wait and hope.

I don't drink during the weekdays. I don't even have any cravings or want to during the weekdays. However, once Friday night hits, I have a few drinks. Then I spend Saturday drinking as well. I get horrible hangovers that are only getting worse. I will get a hangover even with 2 beers.

However, my weekend habit does not allow me to do that. I just need to get into healthier habits with my boyfriend. When the weather is nice or even if we're just having a good day, we want to sit outside and enjoy a drink. Maybe I can just replace the drink with non-alcoholic options. I don't even know. ALSO, the hangxiety as become debilitating. Honestly it's worst than the actual hangover sometimes.

Stopped jan 1 and was good until 9.10 and drank for the first time. My main reason for not drinking was mainly because I‚Äôm addicted to weed and knew that if I drank, my judgment walls would go down and I would relapse and smoke. So I stopped doing both and kept it up. 

However this past weekend I‚Äôm down at a family members beach house all alone - the rest of my family was coming the next morning. So I decided to watch a movie and have a drink. I wouldn‚Äôt say I got drunk but didn‚Äôt feel bad about it. The next day my mom and bro and sis came and we had an ok time. Had a cocktail that night. Only one. No buzz or anything. 

My mom currently has brain cancer and it‚Äôs very serious. So part of this trip was to spend time w her and enjoy ourselves. However she is also a covert narcissist and the cancer has made her 100x worse than ever before. The next morning as my siblings and I are doing a puzzle she just appears and says she wants to go home because there‚Äôs nothing to do and starts fighting w all of us. And of course everyone jumps to her concerns and she gets the attention she wants and was ok the rest of the day. But that night I had like 4 cocktails as I was so annoyed at this behavior and just have so much anxiety being around her as she will pounce on anything you say to tell you that you‚Äôre being mean or disrespectful or whatever. And this is after taking off for 4months and taking her to every radiation and doctor apptmnt. 

They all left the next day and I decided I wanted some wine. So I had a bottle. And then two trulys. Alone again. 

I‚Äôll reset when I leave this house and go back home tonight. The big thing is that I didn‚Äôt smoke. The second big thing is that being drunk is just kinda meh. After these 8mos of sobriety I‚Äôm like ‚Äòoh I see why I enjoy drinking but I don‚Äôt really need to do this‚Äô. So I‚Äôm bummed I relapsed but it was just a good reminder that it doesn‚Äôt solve anything.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5686591}"

I‚Äôm also researching **ways problem drinking has been either glamorized or sugarcoated to younger audiences via pop culture**. For example, The Simpsons were a huge part of my childhood, but damned if the show didn‚Äôt make light of Homer and Barney‚Äôs rampant alcoholism in a fairly reckless way for young viewers. Other ones I thought of: the cute little E.T. guzzling beer in the kitchen, characters from Cheers, Rick of Rick & Morty, etc. What representations in TV and movies when you were a kid skewed your thinking about alcohol and drinking in a way that was maybe ultimately harmful?

I debated for a minute and then called 911 to let them know about a person in distress.  

It's funny because I feel conflicted about doing that kind of thing, but I try to remind myself it is an act of kindness. The debate is: I don't want the person to somehow get in trouble.  And maybe they don't want to be attended to by medical personnel.  Maybe I'm over-reacting to what I saw.

Since getting sober, I've called 911 on at least three people who seemed to be either wrestling with mental or substance abuse issues and were in distress.  I've called in a couple of drunk drivers too.  I hate it.  I feel like I'm ratting out my people.  I feel like a snitch.  When I was drinking, it was _my business_ and the rest of the world should stay out of it, and now I'm some self-righteous sober jerk bringing the law down on my former fellow drinkers.

But one time someone shared a story about how someone reported them for drunk-driving and it snapped them out of a months-long relapse and got them back on track with their sobriety.  And so, when I make these kinds of calls, I hope that it gives the person a chance to break some sort of cycle and find help and health.

After the call to 911, my kids asked why I did it.  I told them that if someone saw me laying on the ground at 8:09am next to a busy street, I'd hope they would call for help.  Inside I thought ""maybe I wouldn't want help.  Maybe I'd resent the person who called.  Maybe I'd reject emergency services.  I'd probably go right back to whatever lead me to be on the sidewalk as soon as I was let go."" because that's the kind of stupid thing I could see myself doing when I was drinking.

But I called anyway.  I won't ever know what happened to that person.  I hope I did right by them.  I hope they got some help with whatever they were struggling with.

I have tried to quit before, I even managed to moderate while my wife was pregnant.  It was not enough to stop, but it was a mountain for me.  

I have always told myself that today doesn't matter if I drink or not.  A few drinks tonight is not going to hurt me, its kind of the problem.  I see plenty of you who can't stop drinking once you start, everyday drinking is a blackout day.  I don't have that kind of problem.  I can walk the tipsy line *everyday*.  I almost never get really drunk.  I don't slur, I don't trip.  I sit in my little haze, and ignore the part of my life that I should be taking action to change.  I don't have any solid reminders that last night was a terrible choice.  I am a text book 'functional' alcoholic.  I have a good job, I don't mistreat anyone, and my grass is always cut.  The way I drink, no one(except the beer distributor and garbage man), will ever know I have a problem.  This is the lie I like to tell myself, but I know it is a lie.

This time I am telling my family.  They have seen my drink in moderation for years, but they had no idea that having a few a holidays was me staying as in control as I possibly could.   They have no idea that I have never been sober for more that a few days since I was in my early 20s and that most days it more than would make an average person get sick.

I told my sister last week that I was quitting, she had no idea I had a problem.  Our father was/is a drunk, and she pointed out how different our lives would have been if he had gotten clean when we were children.  That thought broke my heart thinking about my little baby having to go through that.  Getting yelled at for no reason, neglected, having toys get broken, finding the garbage bags full of beer cans.  My mom tried to hide it and did a decent job for a while.  She hid the reason, but we always were afraid of him.  I KNOW I will not be that, but even if I manage to not be that kind of monster, I could be even better.  I could be more present, I could get more done, I could be more involved.  I never really worried about have a better life myself or that I deserve that.  Thinking about this new tiny life, I know he deserves a better childhood than I had.

10 days ago i started taking my medication again and those of you who have experience with antidepressants know that it usually gets worse before it gets better. i know today is finally the day where i feel like things are getting better because i suddenly have this sense of ""everything's gonna be ok"". i know i still have a lot of work to do but it feels nice having a little bit more self confidence, a little bit more self esteem, resulting in a little bit more hope.",17,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.38389498}"

It has caused major physical and mental health problems, financial problems and causes strain in my marriage. It has also robbed me of quality time spent with my children. They are young enough that I can stop and they never have to see me take a drink. 

I struggle daily with the desire to quit and the urge to drink and always succumb to that urge. I do mental gymnastics to talk myself in to doing the same thing over and over again. 

I'm so over it. I had success from involving myself with this community about 6 years ago. I hope to hold myself accountable and lean on this community for support again. 

I have a loving wife who is more than supportive. I'm finally ready to quit this destructive life I have created for myself.

He took me in and was there for me when i was in a rough place mentally and I probably love him more than anyone else in the world.

Both of us were heavy alcoholics drinking every day till one of us blacked out. Since he got married, his alcohol consumption has decreased but he still has a couple of beers almost every day. I on the other hand got worse and worse till I had a nervous breakdown and had to quit my job to sort myself out. Long story story short.. 4 weeks sober now !! 

I went to his house for dinner yesterday and to my surprise he asked me if I wanted a drink. When I refused, he asked me if I was still doing that 'No Alcohol' thing. Now i agree that there have been a few times where I've started a new exercise regime or diet and failed in a couple of months. But the 'No Alcohol' thing is different. I then spent the next hour explaining to him how much better I've been the past few weeks and that I've quit alcohol for good. But he still seemed skeptical and ngl it hurt a lot. 

To be fair, I kinda understand why he didn't take me seriously. Society and media constantly condition us to ignore that damage alcohol causes and accept it as an integral part of life. If anything today reinforced to me that the only way I can convince him how serious I am is through action. I'm doing this for myself.  I've been reading 'This Naked Mind' and it has really opened my eyes to how I was slowly poisoning myself to death in the most painful way possible. I want more life than hangovers and panic attacks trying to remember what stupid thing i did yesterday. Hope he understands...

I'm a child of Alkies, and to be honest was heading down that road myself. Funny thing is, I woke up one Friday (13/8/21) and just though ""bugger this I'm done"" 

What's really bothering me is the complete lack of the horrible symptoms. I'm not boasting or anything, apart from some really mad dreams and wanting to sleep all the time I seem to be coping. I was a bottle of wine a night drinker who thought I was hiding it (yeah, that didn't happen lol) and I'm worried addiction is just hiding around the corner waiting to club me over the head with a bottle of Rose. For the first week especially I was jittery but that's over a month now and apart from the boredom the freedom to jump in the car at any time, be a part of my family more often,  the more cheerful outlook and the weight loss is great. I've even cut back on my happy pills.

I suppose the end result of all this rambling is, for the first time in approx 25 years I can actually say I want to do this. Not saying I am going to make it without a blip on the way but you know what? For the first time in a long while I like myself. I have an amazing partner, a fantastic wee boy and 3 mentally unstable but fun dogs.

My son has been testy tonight and rn I just feel numb and deflated. I need an ""out"" and usually it's alcohol but I'm determined not to drink.

At the risk of invalidating my own feelings, I know others have it worse than me, and I really don't know how I'd cope with the continuous lockdowns like they have overseas.

Now I've got a bunch of beer in my house that I don't really want there. Do I throw them out? Do I keep them for when I have friends over again so they can drink them? I do appreciate the gift so throwing it out seems like a waste.

Good day everyone, and happy Monday!! I hope everyone had a nice and sober weekend. Thank you for checking-in yesterday! I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre all here today. And welcome to those joining us for the first time. Please know you‚Äôre NOT alone. 

Prior to quitting the drink, I never thought I‚Äôd be able to. Like, never ever! It was engrained in who I was (or so I thought). I ‚Äúneeded‚Äù it to be chatty and funny and brave and daring and lively. I needed it to relax. It was my crutch. Well, usually crutches are supposed to help you for a short time and then you get rid of them once you‚Äôre heeled. Alcohol as my crutch stuck around for way too long. I wish I could say I knew what finally ‚Äúclicked‚Äù and gave me the confidence to put the bottle down and just be Aly once and for all. What I‚Äôve discovered during my sober time is that I‚Äôm still funny (in my own mind anyway) and brave and daring and lively and FUN without booze.

I partied hard in college, but no harder than anyone else.

After a few years out I realized I was still drinking socially and ocassionally after a workday eventhough it just numbed my emotions and made things worse.

I mean like I would drink 1-2 drinks a week, and possibly 5-6 on a night out. In college those numbers were 3-4 week and 7-8 on an ocasional night out.

Never blacked out, never been in trouble, never hid my drinking, though I have made some dumb choices when drunk.

After a while alcohol stopped agreeing with me. So I decided to stop. I notice that it's challenging, that my friends pressure me, and that alcohol is actually a very common thing around my life. I associate it with fun and it's hard to have fun without it.

I realized it was challenging to stop, so I decided to go to 2 AA meetings this weekend.

The stories I heard were so terrible, the amount of alcohol so drastic, that I really felt like I didn't belong.

Is AA for alcoholics or for anyone who simply wants to stop drinking? I really feel I don't belong. I'm confused about what support system I can have. Any advice? Anyone here a moderate drinker who found success with AA?",12,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6712992}"

This was something I have obsessed about for the past 2 years of trying to get sober. It was my number 1 reason why I thought I could NEVER be sober - because for 30 yrs I have been known as the party gal; every social occasion  I was drinking and mostly drunk; drinking was my lubricant for dancing; social conversations; 'deep and meaningful' discussions; flirting; having Fun! And I thought that everyone would judge me for being boring and straight if I wasn't drinking!  
So this weekend I found out it's all a load of rubbish! And all in my mind! I went out and had a fantastic dinner with my mates; I talked about deep and meaningful things; went clubbing and danced like a wild sexy thing and I had FUN!  It was fun to try mocktails and I totally enjoyed the food and music. I got a cab home safely sober when the party became too messy and woke up hangova free!  
No one was really interested in the fact that I wasn't drinking. I just said I was off the booze for a bit cos I have had a bit of work stress and drinking wasn't helping with that (true). And that worked with no more comments and the conversation moved on.  I noticed that I had 2 types of mates -some that just had 1-3 drinks over the evening and others that got smashed!  I realised that in my drinking life I was in the 'get as smashed as u can' group! If I had been drinking I would have been obsessing about getting more drink into me all nite; wanting to order drinks faster than anyone else at the table; and basically just trying to chase that high and get smashed. It was soooo refreshing not to have this obsession and just really be present and enjoy the night! And it was 100% FUN with no regrets, blackouts, hangova or shame!

I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt know there were bad decisions laying next to good decisions in my kitchen. 

My dog did me a solid and ate half the cookies I baked a few days ago. I was pretty sad at first, she hid in the living room when I discovered it because she knew she was bad.

Drinking is a big part of law school culture, and I've come to rely on it as a crutch in group settings so I can feel relaxed and fun. And during the pandemic lock-down, I developed a habit for binge drinking a lot of beer alone at night while watching TV. 

Rationally, \*I know\* my binge drinking is a destructive/harmful habit. I've dealt with depression/anxiety for years, and so I know that alcohol is going to make it worse. I know that after I binge drink, I end up staying in bed late the next day. I know that I'm sabotaging myself because of this, showing up late to work, falling behind on school assignments. Yet even though I know all this, I still often end up giving into the temptation. After a long, stressful, boring day, my mind seeks out the instant gratification of getting drunk, of feeling carefree and light for a few hours, ignoring the bigger picture--that those few hours of pleasure are going to be followed by many hours of pain. 

I've done a couple successful thirty day sober breaks in the last year, but whenever I start drinking again, I can't get myself to just stop after two drinks anymore; my mind becomes this greedy monster who keeps saying ""more more more!"" So I'm thinking that I want to be sober for a longer period of time, at least until I finish law school. I'm scared though, and I feel like I can't trust myself. Somewhere along the line, I know I'll have insidious thoughts like ""hey I haven't drank in awhile; one night of drinking isn't going to kill me."" 

I wish there was a way to set in stone/freeze the motivation I have right now to not drink, so that I will always continue feeling this way and not have to struggle with moments down the road where my motivation is not as strong. But I can't, and I don't know how I'll feel tomorrow night, in a few weeks, in a few months. I guess that's all apart of delayed gratification though, learning to take things one day at a time to build up my resilience gradually.

Backstory: I am 18 and have decided to stop drinking 3 months ago. Never had a problem with alcohol consumption - it was just the Saturday-clubbing routine, except losing gains and feeling low from time to time. Hangovers became boring and I do not see myself partying and going to the clubs every weekend.

A friend called me last night to get out to the club. They got pretty drunk early, while I was drinking Cola. After few hours, I decided by myself I would like to get a shot of votka. I needed to see how was my body going to react. Not sure if it was placebo, but my mood dropped immediately. That feeling of self-control was half gone and I just knew that I was not feeling like myself.

In the end, I have to admit that it is worth it. This journey has been great and I do not count this as a relapse, because I still feel like I am young enough, but also responsible for my actions. Those 3 months have been amazing and I am going to keep it that way, because I feel more like myself and the Universe and God keep surprising me positively.

Putting down the bottle was the best thing I ever did for myself. One of the things that improved vastly was my dating life. When I was drinking I was a selfish, impulsive liar. I made poor choices, took awful risks, and left a trail of emotional wreckage behind me. After I got sober, I figured out what I really needed and found someone that really made me see the best in myself. We dated with honesty and openness and got closer and closer. We talked about moving in together, about marriage.

That relationship ended yesterday. It didn't explode, like my relationships used to. It didn't end in screaming and recrimination. We talked, we cried, we said hard truths, and we let each other go like grownups.

I am in so much pain right now. I can't stop crying for more than an hour or two at a time. My heart is heavy, and I'm having trouble eating solid food. I slept in sweaty, feverish snatches last night.

But even though I'm hurting, even though I know it is the one thing in the world that would give me temporary relief, I have zero desire to pick up a drink. I know where that road leads.

Even in the deepest pain I've felt in years, I have the clarity and sense to make the right choice for me in this moment. Alcohol eroded my sense of self. My will to do the right thing. The hard and bumpy road to sobriety taught me that I am strong, that I can withstand this storm and any other that comes my way.

I'm actually not specifically talking about drinking, but healing, growth and progress in life is just not linear. For me, I have stopped romanticizing alcohol and the desire is not there like it once was. Alcohol never offers anything new. Alcohol is not capable of change or growth and will be the same old alcohol tomorrow and in 5 years from now. 

I guess I'm feeling deflated and down right now because I am leaving behind the person I once was and I am not sure who the next version is yet. And that almost has nothing to do with alcohol. My marriage has fallen apart (not due to drinking), my heart is still broken over another relationship that I just cannot seem to put behind me. I have lost friends and am now a non-drinker, feeling totally out of my comfort zone. I don't recognize my life right now and it's really unsettling - I mean I suppose in a good way, but it's hard. A few quotes that were helpful to read from the author Shane Parrish:

Radical Christians made it easier.,"I don't know why last night was hard. I dropped my friend off at the airport late Friday night and spend most of Saturday editing a work manuscript.

Once I finished for the day, I couldn't stop thinking about alcohol. I knew my friend had a bottle of whiskey in a cupboard. He said his ex-girlfriend gave it to him as a gift. He rarely drinks, and said I could have it.

Last night, home alone, I gave into temptation. I opened the cupboard and took down the box, which had a picture of Kentucky bourbon on the front. Then I cut off the tape with a pair of scissors.

The entire box was stuffed to the lid with chocolates and candy. The ex-girlfriend, knowing my friend doesn't drink, had taken out the bottle and replaced its original content with bags of Twizzlers and M&Ms.

Part of me was elated; the other part was disappointed. I let the disappointed part get the best of me.

I checked the time; it was 11pm. I went into my room, grabbed my backpack, helmet, and gloves, and got onto my motorcycle.

However, I live in a dry county. The biggest town here is dominated by a large, Christian college, which uses its private endowment to ensure no local business can ever get a liquor license. Since we don't have any bars or alcohol retailers, the closet liquor store is across the county line, a half-hour away.

After five minutes of driving, I turned into a parking lot and drove home. I remembered that I had a problem--and realized that taking a late-night drive to the liquor store was evidence of it.

I ended up spending the rest of the night in. I smoked a little weed--I'm not a big fan, but it puts me to sleep--played some video games, ordered a pizza, and called it a night.

Honestly... I don't know what happened last night. In hindsight, I'm ashamed of myself. I've almost reached one month alcohol-free. I've thought about drinking here and there. I gave into temptation once, a couple weeks back, but tossed my bottle after taking a sip-and-a-half of Fireball. Outside of that, I've been *happy* about sobriety. But if I weren't staying with a friend in this here dry county, I'd have woken up with a pounding hangover and a massive sense of regret.

If anyone has any questions feel free to ask.

It is now 5.5 years since I had my last drink. I had been drinking heavily since I was 16, and drank for 25 years.  At  first I was self medicating what I later found out was social anxiety then the inevitable happened. 

I held down jobs, one for 16 years, had long term relationships, kidding myself that I was okay and that controlled drinking was fine. I'd had several detoxes both at home and in patient and periods of accompanying sobriety but I always relapsed. I also had periods of joblessness where my drinking peaked at 1.5 litres of vodka a day.

May 2016 I was admitted to hospital with alcoholic hepatitis, pancreatitis, ALD, malnutrition and ascites, I was literally Homer Simpson yellow. The doctor told me that I had a 1 in 6 chance of not making it out alive but he promised me that the hospital would do all they could to help me. A calendar month later I left the hospital, I was terrified and relieved in equal measure. I can remember the day like it was just yesterday,  the warm showery rain and most importantly the first day of the rest of my sober life.

It was really rough at first, everything I'd ever known revolved around drinking, it was literally like starting a new life.  I just kept busy, planning stuff to keep myself occupied, planning a future, riding out the darker moments and days. I decided to compartmentalise what had happened in the past, if anyone asked where I had been I told them to stop the rumour mill in the tracks and start afresh and foster a positive mental attitude. 

One thing I noticed as soon as I got home  is the sleep. Proper uninterrupted sleep is one of the best things about staying sober. The disposable income is great as well.

18 months later I quit smoking a 20 a day, 24 year habit and now I have built a new life for myself, my depression has lifted, my SA is under control thanks to help from a psychologist and CBT. I have a new home complete with a sweet rescue cat, a great landlord,  several new hobbies including running and found myself a nice job. The pay isn't amazing but my workmates are great.

The last four months or so have been a rollercoaster for me. Five months ago, I was moderating pretty okay until an old friend popped up in town and we got to catching up - and drinking, and drinking, and then even more drinking. I think I drank more that night than I ever did - or, so I thought at the time, at least. 

As a result, I was sober for two and a half months. I thought I was doing pretty alright - I couldn't get into AA or anything too rigid like that, but I was maintaining. In retrospect, I'd become a dry drunk and was a chore for my girlfriend to be around. 

So, two and a half months later, we broke up. And oh boy, did I go right back to drinking. And hard. Immediately. Over the course of the month, it became apparent that I was spiralling out of control quick, so I stopped. Again. 

For two weeks. Then, my birthday, six days ago. I broke, had a very responsible drink - then another, and another, and. . .well, I've been drinking very hard since. 

So, that's where I'm at now. I'm going to taper, because safety, but I've got to put a stop to this and quickly. My ex and I still live together, and she's one of my best friends - and I hate that she's had to witness this over the course of our relationship. And I hate that this is a problem I have, that I allowed myself to have it, because both of my parents had it and it killed my father. 

That's right - alcohol straight up murdered my father. It was responsible for every terrible thing that happened to him, and in the end, it gave him cancer and took his voicebox and was the thing that made his throat explode, which killed him. He died alone, in a second chance apartment, drinking cheap vodka out of a plastic bottle, against the advice of every doctor who told him ""if you drink again, you will die.""

And yet, here I am. 

Why do I drink? Oh, the reasons are super clear. I have a debilitating mental health disorder. I have a very intense form of OCD. I'm confused about my sexuality. And, if it wasn't apparent, I've got some rather large daddy issues. I've got a lot of stuff in my head I'm trying to quiet down, constantly. 
 
I've been a complete chaotic mess the entire time we've been going out - but I won't be, anymore. 

It's either rehab or outpatient or something, as well as a renewed interest in AA. But, I'm starting in earnest as of tomorrow.

Last night a friend came over so we watched bad movies and played video games. It was nice being able to focus on what we were going to do next, as well as to drive to pick up pizza to save a few bucks. There were several opportunities for alcohol yesterday but it felt a lot more normal just ordering something else. Again, it was nice not having to figure out how much I could drink, and how fast, if I needed to give anyone a ride, and if anything I was texting back to people sounded weird. I'm really happy that so far no one has really questioned me not drinking when alcohol is offered, since that's pretty unusual.

Everything is still repairable and we have a wonderful relationship, but god I feel ashamed. 

Essentially she said very kindly that I'm useless when drinking or hungover (per normal) and that I have left her to do a lot when she needed me the most, we rarely have sex if I'm drinking, and she doesn't want us to lose our partnership and love. 

&#x200B;

I will give her credit that she's wonderful and it wasn't a 'you're a piece of shit' conversation, more of 'I know you and love you and this isn't you, what's going on.'

One of the statements that stung was 'When I come home sometimes I check the trash to see what kind of boyfriend I'm going to have.' 

I'm not violent or mean or anything, and have no history of it, I just shut off and literally become useless, watch netflix or play videogames etc. When I'm sober I'm much more active, happier, productive.

I'm upstairs crying at my desk as I type this, just sorta sucks because this is never the man I wanted to become.

I can't believe at 29 I never thought I'd reach that low point of having someone sit me down and be like 'this hurt...' because I'm not a hurtful guy and want the best for people. I literally drink to ignore reality or work...

There's nothing good going to come down that road, and last night after both crying, none of that would have happened if I just didn't drink. It's CREATING my problems.

Not sure how to start but I'm a recovering alcoholic (3 bottles of wine a day in the past) I just wanted to know what are people's experiences were when you first spoke about being an alcoholic and how people treated you after they knew?

I'm all for being honest but everyone I have ever told has treated me different over night. I was a functioning alcoholic I never looked or acted drunk but I've told friends, ex bosses and partners, all have whom have treated me like an alien or a mess and avoided me, Ive never hurt anyone and I don't even swear, being honest has really been so hurtful for me, I can't even go out to the shops without people quizzing me when I'm back (especially family). I am sober but those who know will accuse me or avoid me if I even look tired or drop something (I'm clumsy) I have caught my dad searching through my bag a few times when I visited.

Im also Bi Polar and I just disclosed this to my partner  and also mentioned my drinking and boom..if I get manic for a few days it's automatically assumed.im wasted , it really sucks

I really can't believe it's taken this long to finally feel like my good old self. The 4 days of drinking that were my last binge really hit hard, and its still scary to think about. The shakiness has subsided, but I took a video yesterday of my hand shaking involuntarily, just so that I can use it to look back on and remember how hellish the past week has been. 

I've confided in a couple of close friends as well, notifying them that I won't be drinking. They were very understanding, which was a relief. Whenever I'd try to dry out in the past, I'd feel weird about telling people about it and would collapse pretty quickly. This time feels a bit different though ...

I just wanted to share my thoughts because on my way here I wasn't sure what why I was trying, or what to expect.

I don't know what to expect as I continue on either but it's only over time that each revelation becomes something so familiar you can take it for granted.

What has taken me most by surprise is how much a drink was a filler, a mask, a cover for so many things. It took almost the full year of experiencing life as it is, for me to be be able to see that.

I used to tell myself I wasn't a heavy drinker, and that is true, but over time I became a frequent drinker. When you learn alcohol is for the weekend, and you work shift work, or you don't have a job, or work food service, you squeeze in a lot of 'weekends' and in retrospect I was experiencing my life through a haze.

A drink right after work left no time for reading a book, having an actual conversation, paying attention to a movie (for real Netflix is way less entertaining sober though?), having sex, planning my week, going to bed on purpose. It left no room in my brain to think hey, maybe go work out, or text your friend back, or decide to take up a new hobby, or think about why you're unhappy and what you can do.

It was a very convenient way to shut my brain up, until at some point it wasn't and I found it amplified anxiety and panic. Around the time I stopped drinking I started therapy because my brain was telling me that horrible things would happen for mysterious illogical reasons, and turns out that's OCD. So I would just be sitting there, bottle of wine on the table, internally panicking but too cloudy in my thoughts to do something about it in the short or long term. But hey, it's relaxing because #wineoclock, right?

I have been surprised that a large part of sobriety has been kind of awful? Because it turns out I am absolutely terrible at feeling my feelings. But it has also been so amazing it's hard to put into words - I did not magically lose 20lbs, I am not a marathon runner now, I am not a new person, but life feels a little bit brighter and it's easier to laugh, and I feel more comfortable in the skin I previously wanted to claw my way out of.

So I'm putting this out there because if you are on Day 23, or Day 103 and still feel new to this and wondering why you feel like shit? Because you're sober now so everything is supposed to be fixed, right?

Chances are like me, you felt like shit before but you had just consistently drowned it out and mistook the cycle of stressed to buzzed to sleepy to groggy or hungover for what ""fine"" looks like. But if you take that away, I have learned that you can experience the actual ups and downs of life as they happen. So keep going. Each day counts for each day, but it sure is nice to look back at a few hundred of them and see yourself changed.

There was one night about 6 months in where I felt super restless, I turned to the chat from this subreddit, and it was really helpful.

Do you know that saying ‚Äúthey drive me to drink‚Äù, This is literally true regarding my mother. I recently moved back to where I grew up close to my parents. My mom and I have always had a difficult relationship, she‚Äôs very manipulative in many ways, she likes to bully on social media (I do not have her on any of it anymore) she‚Äôs just really a not nice person. She tries to control everything and everyone around her, my father has basically cut out his entire family out of his life because she‚Äôs been so awful to everyone and always plays the victim game (it‚Äôs everyone else not her who‚Äôs in the wrong). She‚Äôs been pretty awful to me until I bought this house, and now she‚Äôs high on this happiness of a new home. Pretends the past never happened. She‚Äôs never said or done anything wrong! 

What I found helpful with her is to talk on the phone and not allow her to text or message me because she is definitely a keyboard warrior. Do not play into any drama or gossip. This has helped. I‚Äôve set clear boundaries and she fought back for a while but it‚Äôs comfortable now.

But since moving back, and now recently into my first home just this week she is showing up every day, Walking around nitpicking everything. Controlling my father and trying to tell him what to do in order to help me with the house and this morning at 8:30 banging on my door demanding I go outside and they show me how to use the power washer so I can power wash my house today. Now some may say she‚Äôs being very helpful you should be thankful. Well yes I am very thankful I have them and they have helped me. But the fact that she comes over, expects entry early in the morning pounding on my door demanding I go outside and telling me what to do is a huge trigger. Then when she nitpicks my garden hose and the garage etc to death and starts arguing with my dad about how to use that thing I  simply said thank you but this is more than I can handle right now I have a lot to do inside still, so she said I was being picky and would only use a new power washer and they were leaving.

So now I am already am thinking about picking up a bottle of wine when I go do my weekly groceries this morning so I can drink and sit on my phone and vent to my sister about her later today.

‚ÄúAddictive Flavored Poison in Fancy Bottles‚Äù

After my recent setback I‚Äôm now 2 days sober and feeling much better - actually got a good night‚Äôs sleep last night.

Also - I use a wearable to track my resting heart rate and HRV - the times when I was sober vs. ongoing overconsumption are clear as night and day on the charts.

So as I see it, the cons of alcohol for me are:

- Feel rotten on an ongoing basis
- Feel badly about myself
- Cause significant problems in my relationships
- Gain weight
- Have a high heart rate
- Have low HRV
- Sleep poorly
- Have blackout periods where I have no clue what happened

And the pros of refraining from this addictive poison:

- Feel much more healthy, sleep well
- Lose weight
- Much lower heart rate, higher HRV
- Better relationships (significantly)
- Feel proud of myself - have a much greater sense of self-worth
- More optimistic about the future
- Save a ton of money

When I lay it out like that, it seems pretty obvious to me that I should never get back on the alcohol treadmill again‚Ä¶

It's the least I can do to return the favor of what this subreddit has done for me...

I was definitely more nervous than I had cared to admit about a social event that I had agreed to about a month ago. It was a nighttime college football game and tailgating with some good friends.

I've done this multiple times before over the last ten years and it was always a blast to catch up with good people. But, it was always an obvious opportunity to get absolutely blasted, and it was expected that you get blasted. And blasted I absolutely got at previous functions. And I would spend the entire Sunday recovering.

Here is the summary:  


* I am still sober. Happily fucking sober and proud as a damn sober peacock  

* It was a MUCH easier than I ever imagined  

* I was ready to be quite curt with my news, but a strange thing happened...
   * When I started to explain, it was like a water spout that wouldn't shut off. I told them everything. I came right out and said I have had a problem for quite some time, a very big problem, and I decided to do something about it
   * I didn't expect this. As it was spewing from my mouth it was like I couldn't shut it off. But in a good way  

* ***I was greeted with warmth, empathy, encouragement, and mild joking***  

* It only came up one more time later in the night in the form of a joke. The group opted to get ice cream cones and I was asked 'hey, did you give up ice cream too???'. Meant in fun, of course  

* I was as energetic and conversationally engaged as I ever had been and even more so  

* My silly joking was as good (or bad depending on your perspective) as it had ever been  

* The visual crispness of the night as it went on surprised me. The contrast of the lights with the darkening sky, the colors of shirts and jerseys, the green grass
   * I realized that this is how a sober person experiences things. It is not in a dull haze  

* I enjoyed myself a hundred times more than I would have had I been drinking, no doubt about it  

* I truly never felt tempted. If there was any temptation, it was more of the 'perceived comfort' of having a cold brew in your hand? As if I wanted to fit in with the stereotype definition of tailgating? And not necessarily missing the taste or buzz of alcohol? When this very mild temptation hit me, it really struck me as odd. Real, but odd!

Here is what I would do differently now that I know:  


* ***Bring multiple flavors of flavored seltzer!***
   * I stocked up on 12 cans of grape seltzer. Let me tell you something - by the 3rd can, I was starting to despise grape anything
   * Definitely, definitely, definitely, bring flavored seltzer, it is a life saver!
   * Definitely, definitely, definitely, bring ASSORTED flavors! You will very quickly tire or even be annoyed by the flavor, at least it is what happened to me  

* Taken a couple of Advil before the game (maybe)
   * Maybe I am getting older, but it was louder than I remember!
   * When I got up this morning I told my wife that I felt hungover. It felt exactly like a hangover, without the palpitations that would scare the shit out of me. Now, as I type this, I am feeling so much better. But so surprised at the 'wasted' type of feeling upon waking!!!! Really shocked actually. Without a drop of alcohol, I still felt 'burnt'? Odd. But I don't do this often and it is probably attributable to the crowd noise  

* That's it! Only two things!  


Looking back, I am glad I spewed out everything. It felt great to get it off my chest. I was polite, meaning, I didn't extend my spewing and stopped when it was appropriate, but man, did it ever fucking feel great to get it off my chest.

Last year, we celebrated my daughter‚Äôs first birthday. On the day of the party, there was a Covid scare for everyone on the guest list except my in-laws. 

All that food, the big from-scratch cake, prep, decorations, cleaning, rendered useless. Stressed, I began to drink. 

I don‚Äôt remember singing happy birthday to my baby. I don‚Äôt remember her smashing her little cake. I was there. My wife shared the video of our baby with her cake. I was in the shot, next to my child with a drink in my hand. But I do not have that memory. The only thing I remember was cooking the food and baking the cake. I blacked out at my daughter‚Äôs first birthday. 

We just celebrated our daughter‚Äôs second birthday yesterday. I remember everything. The look of joy when she saw her Elsa balloon. The way the balloon flowed thru the house bobbing up and down as my kiddo tugged it along. The smell of the food wafting through the air, the music, our friends and their kids, all the smiles. I remember all of it. 

It was stressful putting the party together. There were a couple hiccups. A handful of people couldn‚Äôt make it due to Covid. Not once did I feel the need to drink. 

I am just north of 11 months sober. My daughter‚Äôs first birthday was the catalyst for me to reassess my relationship with alcohol.  Remembering her birthday is far more satisfying than any drink I have ever had. 

I recognize now, I cannot change past me or past me‚Äôs actions. Present me is sober to enjoy all the little moments so I can look back on them as fond memories.

Tonight i hit 8 hours of sleep which is superior to 4 last night. I had a nightmare that i was drinking my favorite beer. Woke up in panic, looked at my pc desk and there were zero empty cans. I calmed down but then i noticed a very annoying headache which lasted until midday. It was not a hangover headache, neither a migraine. Not sure what that was, had some coffee, didn't help, had many cups of tea - didn't help either. Prob some toxins getting released and flooding my brain, but progress is progress.

Today i finally managed to focus to sit and go through the html basics practice part of my online courses. It was a bit challenging at first, but i managed to focus for more than two hours of productive work. That is amazing and proves that i can still learn new stuff!! How did i ever expect to learn that stuff while drunk?

I feel like i have so much time now while sober. And the stuff i used to do while drunk or on hangover (watching series, youtube, gaming) does not seem interesting or rewarding at all.

Is life perfect in recovery? No, of course not. This year has been quite a low year in general, with some nice moments sprinkled in. 2021 has been the lowest since parts of my first sober year. But at least in recovery, I can learn from these experiences. I can change, because I'm not running away from emotions any longer. 

In recovery, life became a lot less lonely. When going through bad periods, instead of drinking them away and blacking out at the pub, I look for connection with loved ones. The quality of relationships got so much better.

Sometimes I feel like I've only lived for real for 4.5 years. Ever since sobriety, I feel like a barrier between my inner world and my outer world has been lifted. The good feels more real, the bad feels more real. While I was drinking, everything got neutralized to a grey 'meh'. 

Because of this, I found a new energy to live. So much to do, so many dreams to try out. Both professionally, in education, in art, in relationships, in travel, in athleticism, in going-out (which became a kind of spiritual experience). I admit I'm a 'go hard or go home' kind of person and try to channel that energy in positive and productive directions.

My only regret: not getting sober sooner.

It has been a while so I thought I would update you all. Hopefully give some of the day 1 folk some inspiration.

My last relapse was my worst, 4 months of nonstop heavy drinking. There were days when I would drink a bottle of Spirits and a carton (24 cans) of beer, sometimes more. By the end of it I was so defeated mentally, spiritually and physically. After the initial hangover of shakes, sweats and the worst dry heaving where I was vomiting while trying to breath in and felt like I was close to dying. It then led to about two weeks with my phone off, curtains drawn, in bed all day covers over my face and talk to nobody. I didn't eat for a week and I thought I was never going to go through this. Reading stories on peoples success here seemed like a fairytale. I truly believed that the sobriety was beyond me.

Today my sleep is great (7-8 hours), apatite is great and cooking healthy, I'm working out (not as much as I should) My sugar cravings have gone down. I got a weekend job laboring with a long lost friend who saw me at my worst and I thought he would never give me an opportunity. I got a part time gig in a supermarket and the hours really suit me. 

AA has been the key to my recovery, it made me leave the house, improved my confidence speaking in front of strangers, self esteem boost that nobody judged me, have dinner once a week with the members. 

I can honestly say that I feel content with life, I still have shit days but I can ride the waves and know that the good is gonna come too.

A week ago, I decided to test my sobriety in a way I never have. I went out dancing with this guy I dated earlier this year, this narcissistic, alcoholic attorney (pressure-y about sex and pressure-y about drinking). I am in therapy, and I am addressing why these types of men are attractive to me. Anyway, we started talking again, and I started thinking about him constantly. He's verbally and emotionally abusive, and highly intelligent - he knows how to mess with my head. But I let him. So the entire last week of my first year of sobriety was about him. I just broke up with him. Maybe only people who've been in abusive relationships before can understand this, but I feel terrible now. I miss him. I regret ending it. I'm trauma bonded to him. It sucks.

I should be celebrating one year, but instead I am mourning the loss of color from my life that he brought. He made me feel alive, even when he made me feel bad.

It‚Äôs just not worth it. My job is performance based and with a newborn and wife, to provide the best life for them, I need to stop.

I could have had some and immediately went to brush my teeth before bed so my husband didn't know. I could have just done it and told him it was already done and went out to party more. But I didn't. I didn't even think of those things until after. 

Neither of those things are me.

This is the first time since I started recovery 5 months ago that someone offered me alcohol. I didn't know how I would react, but I was strong enough.

I can hear them being fools outside in the courtyard of our apartment complex. I know they will probably offer again when I go smoke next. But I'll be ready.

I love reading everyone's inspiring stories of how they quit drinking, but I swear it's just impossible for me. I can't even count how many times I've tried to stop. In the beginning years, I would announce to people that I'm going to quit drinking, but I always ended up drinking, so now I've stopped that. I just keep it inside so that at least no one else knows how many times I've failed. Drinking was a real problem on my late father's side of the family... they are literally all gone now due to drinking or other addictive habits. I don't want to head down the same road, but it is like I'm two different people. At times (often in the morning...) I'll easily commit myself to not drinking. But, without fail, usually around sometime in the early afternoon, I find myself 'automatically' thinking of booze. There doesn't even seem to be any trigger! I could literally just be at work, deeply involved in some project and then it just pops into my head. Once the thought is there, it is relentless until I drink. If I don't drink, I'll find myself laying in bed thinking of getting up just to say 'F--- it, this is pointless anyways, may as well 'enjoy' myself so I can get this off my mind'.   


I've tried online therapy, I've even tried a drug (naltrexone?) to get me to stop. I've tried picking up new hobbies, changing friends, journaling... nothing works. I'm pretty sure I'm just a weak willed individual with an ""alcoholism"" gene. Lately, I find myself just moving into 'acceptance' of, 'This is my fate, I can't do anything about it, so I may as well just accept it and move on with whatever time I have left.' 

&#x200B;

I don't mean for this to sound like a ""poor me pity party"" and I know that change can only come from within, but after trying all these things, I really feel I'm out of options. 

Does anyone have any advice on this matter?

It‚Äôs a wonderful spot to talk about your wins, or vent about your challenges- and move right past them. Got a tip that‚Äôs working for you? Feel free to share it with the class! 

So I‚Äôve been hosting this thread for quite a few weeks now. If you‚Äôve been following along, you know I‚Äôve had my ups and downs with my fitness/diet etc. I am just having a hard time overcoming this plateau I‚Äôve been in for a few weeks now‚Ä¶ I have recently gone back to hot yoga, tried a bootcamp, all of the above. I like working out in group settings, but I am finding myself to be very time-challenged lately. I decided to invest further into my home gym, and went with a Peloton bike. I get the benefits of an instructor led class, and I can easily fit it into my schedule because well, it‚Äôs in my house! So far I‚Äôve had it for three days and completed three rides. I am enjoying it. What‚Äôs that one workout that really does it for you- one you just love to do? 

So that brings me to this: just like with my sobriety, I‚Äôve had to find my way with my fitness journey. I am trying to emulate the drive that I‚Äôve had with my sobriety, with getting fit/healthier etc. Committing to it, finding the right tools, and following through with it one day at a time. I am finding that it is very important to have some joy in what I am doing- and I am a firm believer in my sobriety and my health going hand in hand. I‚Äôm also finding that it‚Äôs ok to switch it up as needed, and find what‚Äôs right for me. Fitness is not a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù journey. It‚Äôs my nature to push myself, probably yours too. Just a gentle reminder to have some grace with yourself as you find what‚Äôs right for you. How will you be kind to your body/mind this coming week? 

Coming here means we are all taking a step and trying. We are all putting in a little effort towards our goals- heck yes to all of that! I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing from everyone today.

Today is day 510 for me and I was hoping to go see my buddy race hobby stocks with my uncle like I do almost every Saturday. But my uncle is busy and didnt get back to me so I sat with my sadness about that for a little bit, journaled, and came to the realization that I don't really do any of my hobbies anymore. I used to read a lot and I used to paint too but the painting only really happened when I was drinking. I really enjoyed painting while drinking because it felt like total and complete freedom of expression. I haven't painted since I've been sober but tonight I decided to break out my airbrush and start. So I'm sitting in the garage having a little difficulty here and there with the airbrush and the urge to drink is creeping up on me pretty hard. The alcohol is 5 steps away in the freezer. Instead, I'm here posting because this community is what helped me hold strong in the early days of my journey. You guys helped me see that in sobriety there is a whole me that I didnt know existed, that there will be hard days, but I'm capable of pushing through for just one more day.

There are so much I need to say but maybe I could save them for future post. So let‚Äôs start with my current struggle. 

I‚Äôve recognized over the last couple years that my relationship with alcohol can be defined as a coping mechanism. I‚Äôve learned to cut that trigger as much as possible. But still have work ahead of me. 

I had to text my MIL today. Yesterday was her birthday, and there is a local festival so we celebrated there with family. 

My wife and I recently relocated back to the area. It‚Äôs a small and knit together community where everyone knows each other. I get social anxiety in this area because I immediately believe others see me as the same shit head I was in high school. So naturally my first stop was the beer tent. After maybe 10 drinks, I find that a couple shots of bourbon is naturally the next step. The rest of the night is pretty foggy but I know it leads to me falling down and my FIL walking us back to the car. 

My wife feels incredibly embarrassed and notified me today that divorce is the next priority in her life. 

I want to stop, I‚Äôve made strides in quitting, understanding my decision making, and asking myself ‚Äúwhy would it be different this time‚Äù each time I reach for a drink. 

In this area, everyone consumes because there isn‚Äôt much else to do. It‚Äôs part of the culture. I know, I know, ‚Äúno one gives a fuck if you don‚Äôt drink‚Äù but there have been multiple times in the last year where I‚Äôve been questioned on why I politely decline a drink.   

My wife, well for know and hopefully forever, tells me I have a problem. I accept and acknowledge it. The problem is she very much wants to fit the mold in our small corner of the world. I can tell it bothers her the times that I am carrying a water while all the other husbands are passing around 12oz bottles. 

I texted my MIL to apologize for the embarrassment and received a lengthy heart warming acknowledgment. She is genuinely a great person and sees me as a son of 15 years. 

I don‚Äôt want to let people I care about down any more. But I have a feeling that quitting in this area will leave my wife resentful that she is with some that seems less capable of being an adult.

Then as soon as I would walk in the door I would run straight to the kitchen, open the bottle and take a drink. Then hide the bottle in the cabinet before my daughter came downstairs to see it. This was my daily routine. Weekends were the same but worse since I had 2 days off. I would get big bottles and drink in my room. Get ridiculously drunk and then hide the bottles under my bed.

I‚Äôve been sober a little over a month now. Did rehab for two and a half weeks and currently doing IOP(3x a week/6 weeks total). I just started therapy again last week. Been going for more walks, journaling most days, meditation and progressive muscle relaxation before bed. Sleep 7-10 hours a night, fall asleep fast and stay asleep most nights. Have an appointment set up with my psychiatrist to change meds (Currently on 200mg Zoloft for anxiety/OCD and it is not helping).

I‚Äôm so stressed out. I lost my job in June and applied for unemployment but haven‚Äôt seen a dime of it yet. Haven‚Äôt applied for jobs because I didn‚Äôt want to be like ‚Äúoh btw I‚Äôm gonna need two weeks off (for rehab), have limited availability for the six weeks after that (for IOP), and then need another two weeks off right after that (for an upcoming vacation).‚Äù

I started doing Uber again last week because I can‚Äôt wait any longer for unemployment. It‚Äôs decent money but my account is a lot lower than where I like it. 

I‚Äôm always exhausted every single day and have no energy even though I usually sleep fine. My back constantly hurts really bad. I plan on making a doctor appointment those things and call my insurance to see if they cover chiropractics.

I just feel stressed and overwhelmed. I feel hopeless. I thought being sober would feel better mentally and physically but I feel worse than when I was drinking.

People tell me I look a lot better but I sure don‚Äôt feel it. Today is one of those days where I wish I could down a bunch of wine or get hit by a truck.

Side note - I notice that I‚Äôve also been craving a lot of sweets lately.

So my week consists of me spending all week looking forward to Friday night so I can finally get drunk. 

My usual routine is this:

- Start with two drinks

- feel REALLY good for 30 minutes

- the buzz starts to wear off

- time to drink more to recapture that magic

- 2 drinks turns into 5. 5 turns into 7. And so on until I don‚Äôt know how many I‚Äôve had, but I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve gotten into the double digits a couple times.

- pass out with little memory after my third drink

- wake up feeling like shit.

- wait a week, rinse and repeat


Ive been so embarrassed at the amount that I drink that I‚Äôve been hiding it from every one in my life, including my partner. 

Last night, I did the usual Friday night routine. 

I chugged 4 shots of whiskey while my girlfriend was in the bathroom, then poured myself a nice glass of whiskey on the rocks so I could pretend my tipsiness and alcohol smell was from that single glass. My next memories are my girlfriend asking why I was slurring my words off one drink, and asking me how much I drank. Me lying. Me going into the kitchen to ‚Äúget a snack‚Äù and chugging some more whiskey out of the bottle. 

Next memory is me taking the dog for a walk. I don‚Äôt remember much of the walk, but I blurrily remember getting to our nearby park, and falling over. Luckily I didn‚Äôt drop my dog‚Äôs leash or he might have gotten lost. 

I got home and fell again in the room, waking my sleeping girlfriend. She got really (understandably) upset and asked if I needed to go to the hospital. I confessed that I had been hiding my drinking habits from her. I remember nodding off while she was talking to me and her snapping her fingers in my face to keep me awake. She must have been terrified.

I remember nothing else last night. To be honest, I‚Äôm just extremely relieved shes still here this morning. I know I would have trouble trusting someone who has been lying to me for so long. I can‚Äôt imagine the hurt I‚Äôve put her through.

It‚Äôs time for me to stop drinking for good now. Not just for me and my health, but now my relationship hangs in the balance. My sobriety starts today, and the lying and hiding ends. 

I‚Äôm relieved, but also kind of nervous that I‚Äôll fall back on old habits and lose my relationship, or my life.

I'm going to rehab. I've failed, I couldn't manage my drinking. I let my problem seep out and be seen by others. How the hell did I let this happen? Why can't I just be normal? I haven't looked at myself in the mirror in years. I don't like my reflection, I don't like the person I see before me. I can't look at people in the eyes. I'm ashamed to my core of who I am. I'm a failure. These were the thoughts running through the cloud of a hangover and the ativan, on my way to rehab.   


Nine months before I finally started seeking help for my problem. I had disgraced myself in front of my brother and the disgust I had felt from him in that moment had cemented to me that I was out of control. I went to AA for the first time. I was so scared. I was welcomed with open arms. I felt at home and cared for. I was with my people and for the first time I felt understood. ""These people seem happy and nothing like an alcoholic."" I thought to myself. I ended up staying sober for 5 months. Then by chance I found a fifth I had hidden from my significant other. I didn't drink it then, but I didn't toss it either. It sat in my head and gnawed at me. I broke on the night of my 5 month sobriety mark. Instant shame was all I got. Instead of getting right back on the horse I said fuck it. I already threw 5 months down the drain, I'm a drunk and I'll just stay a drunk. Worst mistake I made, not forgiving myself. The next 4 months were hell all over again. On the 10th of September 2018 my then girlfriend found me passed out in my chair at 11 in the morning. I had called out of work and proceeded to get shit faced. Somehow this tiny woman got me in the car and brought me to my moms. Imagine my surprise coming to on my mom's couch. Something in me broke and they convinced this stubborn drunk to go to rehab.   


Rehab was both great and terrible. It got me away from everything and space to care for myself. I took it seriously, I was so ashamed to find myself institutionalized. That was good, my ego was ground to dust. I'm not hot shit, I'm not in control. I was finally able to work on acceptance. And acceptance was the answer. By the way that passage in the Big Book is by far one of my favorite take aways in my sobriety. It helped me so much. I wasn't able to do the full 30 days in rehab. Insurance stopped paying 7 days in. But I was determined. I learned a lot in those 7 days. If you're reading this and are hesitant on going I highly recommend if if you're able to. Take it serious, its life or death in my eyes.   


Getting sober was the single hardest thing I did in my life up to this point. I realized I had no idea who I was. What made me happy. So started the journey of self realization. Of accepting who I was and who I wasn't. Of putting my life in the hands of my higher power (kind of a idealized perfect version of myself, they don't have a sex. They just are and is there for me no matter what.) I was heavy into AA for a year after rehab, I slowly faded out with Covid hitting. I love AA, but it's not a big part of my journey currently. 

I've gone through so much in these last three years. I lost my greatest champion, my grandma, to lung cancer. She lived long enough to see me one year sober, however she succumbed shortly after that. She was the sweetest, strongest person I know and she always had my back in sobriety. I love her dearly and she'll always be with me. I lost a 5 year relationship about 9 months after I got sober. There is so much involved in that and we're already running long. She deserved better and I have nothing but love for her as a person. I started dating sober. I was so afraid to reveal that I was an alcoholic, but with time and practice it became easier. I realized that so many people are actually quite supportive and understanding and it was rarely an issue. I started a new relationship with a wonderful woman. That too ended. I didn't give myself enough time. I didn't really know who I was, what I loved, my boundaries. I didn't have enough confidence. I let all of those things sour a great relationship, I know I am not the only one at fault, but I learned so much from that breakup. 

I lost a lot, but I also gained so so much. I went from almost being fired constantly to having two promotions with a bright future in my company. I bought a house... a house?! I got in control of my finances. I stopped worrying about what ifs and spiraling. I stopped worrying about what past me did. I have forgiven myself. But most importantly I gained self respect and self confidence. 

Getting sober wasn't easy, but it has been the greatest gift. It required a lot of self analyzation. A steadfast resolve that if  I drink everything I've built will collapse. I live a life I can be proud of. I can look at myself in the mirror. I love life now and no longer consider if it'd just be better if I was dead. I'm not special, I'm just like you. We all have this in us, its just about having the willingness to accept that the way we were or are living life is unacceptable and its time to find a new way. The willingness to look at the dark and dirty history we have. The shameful things we've done in our pursuit of a misguided happiness. To not only look at that, but accept it for what it was and forgive ourselves. To keep moving forward no matter what struggle is presented to us. The journey of sobriety makes us strong, we're fucking super heroes. We've been to hell. We have fought back. Or we are fighting back right now. To those of you struggling just know that it does get easier, it gets so much better. Life is so fucking good on this side. I'm with you in this fight, we're all with you. 

Ya'll have been with me from the beginning whether you knew it or not and I owe a huge thanks to all of you new and old. For your stories, your inspiration. The love of this sub is for real. 

I will not drink with you today.

STORY TIME!,"My first post here, folks! A little background about myself, I just turned 33 last Tuesday(Sept 7th). I quit cold turkey on Sept. 5th after a heavy bender of 2 months after I lost two family members from cancer one week apart from each other. I drank regularly for about 4 years, but more in moderation compared to as of recent. July 3rd I started on a binge that sent me in a huge downward spiral. I put down a 750ml bottle of whiskey plus about 12 beers. I'm a pretty big guy (6' 2"" roughly 380lbs with a very high tolerance). I woke up very hungover and didn't want to sleep through my friends big 4th of July Party(Independence Day, how ironic!) so I went to the liquor store and grabbed another bottle and a 24 of budweiser. A few shots and 2 beers, a bump of cocaine and I felt back in the groove as people were starting to show up. I managed to finish the bottle throughout the day and maybe 15 beers this time, switching back and forth from beer to whiskey neat. Boy did it impress some people that I was the last man standing! 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here we are.. a little over 2 months later. Something snapped in me when I woke up this past Sunday morning and told myself I need to stop. Maybe it was the fact that a friend of mine had also died a few days prior and made me ponder my own mortality, maybe it was that I woke up on a pullout couch in a friends basement with my heart racing and having horrible panic attacks unable to sleep and wondering how I was going to survive the 30 min uber ride home without looking like a crazy person or passing out, but I would put my money on that it was most likely both along with a myriad of reasons.

 I drank just about every single day, usually a twelve pack of my go to Budweiser, along with a nip or two of Makers Mark. I became extremely unproductive and couldn't go out unless I had a few beers first to calm my nerves. I am also prescribed clonazepam and have been trying to taper off slowly and I convinced myself that the beer was helping me not rely on clonazepam as much, as I was able to cut my dosage by a 1/3rd. I would sit in front of the computer watching movies, buying shit off of amazon, creeping social media, etc. I would smoke a ton of pot too but it didn't give me the creative spark it once did. I used to create a lot of art and music and I kinda lost interest in all of that.

The first two days of sobriety wasn't too bad at all. I knew withdrawals were going to creep in but I didn't know it was going to be SO FUCKING HORRIBLE! Day 3 I thought I had a sinus infection because I kept coughing up phlegm and my head wouldn't stop hurting, which felt like it was by my sinus. I go to a CVS Minute Clinic(ON MY BIRTHDAY!) and as soon as my blood pressure gets checked, the physician freaked out and said I needed to go straight to the hospital. My Blood Pressure was 175/114. Naturally this sent me into a panic but asked if it was that incredibly dire and she said to go home and take my blood pressure meds asap and if the diastolic doesn't go under 110 within the next couple hours or if I feel symptoms of a stroke or heart attack to head straight to the ER. I stopped taking my BP meds for a few months because it was typically prehypertension levels. I had no idea that my blood pressure would spike like that. It did go down to about 173/98 so I felt slightly relieved that I didn't have to spend my birthday in the ER. 

Day 4 - I start my morning by taking my BP med ( Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg ) and felt the typical nasty side effects from it but my bp remained at around 170/103. I ate a healthy breakfast and did some light cardio and took my clonazepam to keep myself calm. I was doing ok for about 8 hours then all of a sudden it hit me like a ton of bricks. Everything got really bright, intense tremors, the floor was moving beneath my feet, confusion, intense panic attack. The paramedics arrived quickly and took my BP and it was 185/117. Scary shit. I felt incredibly stupid, and they made absolutely sure to let it be known. I had such an unprepared plan of attack. I am typically shy and play down things to my doctor so I didn't want him to know I was binging like an idiot. The ER doc finally saw me after a few hours of waiting and said I don't need to be admitted but to get that BP down by all means necessary, and gave me a script for Librium.

Day 5 - I wake up feeling surprisingly amazing(?), took my meds right away, checked my bp a couple hours later and it was down to 152/87. Did some light cardio, ate a heart healthy breakfast, drank chamomile tea. Life was great. My friend picked me up and we got some sushi, which is when it sank in how foreign everything was feeling. It's a BYOB spot and we always have beers there. I started getting a bit anxious but it quickly melted away. My friend joined me on sobriety that day. Good guy. We then went for a nice long walk in the park, went home, called it a day.

Day 6/7 - My Blood pressure was the lowest I have seen it in a VERY long time. Perhaps a decade when I weighed about 195lbs and biked about 10 miles daily. 123/82! This really put me into the mindset that I want to stay away from alcohol for good. I still have lingering anxiety and cravings however, especially today. I hope this will soon pass as well. I never want to go though that again! How could I be so foolish to stop cold turkey prior to speaking with a medical professional. Never again, I hope. Thank you for reading. Salute!

We had to go thru the park to get to it. We were driving too fast on a winding road. Steam from hydrothermal water bellowing up on both sides of the truck. It was a cold night. Suddenly we careened into a big post meant to keep drivers from exiting the road and we landed in a bubbling sulfur smelling pond. Steam immediately fogging up the windows and the sound of hissing coming out from under the truck and tires.. little pops and phiz and bubbling noises all around us. And I became aware the truck was sinking. Water up to the truck door handles. This is like 2-3 am. In my inebriated state I thought ... this is probably going to burn my skin. We're in the middle of nowhere in pitch black night.

Suddenly a man in a truck with a tow crank on the front pulls up out of nowhere! He screams instructions at us and my friend crawls thru the sliding back window of the truck and attaches the tow anchor somewhere that he threw to her. She crawls back thru the window. He drags us out of the bubbling pond lined with bobby socks trees so called for the mineral deposit soaked into the wood at the bottoms. I remember thinking how pretty the trees looked as the truck lights shined on them at water level.. yeah I was pretty drunk myself

The older man in the tow truck fusses at us for a few minutes about drinking and driving, about how we would have died of 3rd degrees burns if he didn't happen to be there at that moment or if he hadn't stopped. And he scolded us that we couldn't have swam out of that pond alive. It was a deep pond and the truck probably would have been totally submerged in another few minutes had he not arrived. We thanked him. We got in the truck in shock and kind of stunned into soberness. I demanded to drive. I didn't drive 2 miles when the tires popped. The sulfur mineral pool was that hot.

When I think about it I actually had more than a few close calls in my youth. Now I don't know if you believe in God but I do.

I‚Äôve decided the only way to not miss an occasion is to miss all the occasions. I‚Äôve pledged to quit for one year. I know I will see that all those occasions are not made better by alcohol. I know alcohol is a tool used to entice people to get together and I‚Äôm taking that as a challenge to find actual activities to get together with my friends and family. I decided to quit drinking 10 days before my 37th birthday and I‚Äôm finding myself looking forward to enjoying the day sober.

2021-09-11 13:58:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pmc5nc/looking_for_support/,Looking for support,"
I am a 36-year-old male veteran who has PTSD and a substance-abuse problem with alcohol.

I‚Äôll try to keep this short as possible. I‚Äôve had a lot of legal trouble because of alcohol. I have never been in trouble a day in my life while sober. It resulted in me finally stopping drinking for nearly 2 years. I had roughly 23 months of continuous sobriety until about seven months ago. Seven months ago I randomly decided to buy some liquor and consume it at home and get absolutely smashed. My wife was disappointing and worried and I managed to not drink again for several weeks when I on two separate days drank three beers each day. I don‚Äôt think I was visibly intoxicated but I had to come clean with my wife and I have managed to stay sober since that time.

Quite honestly just drinking the three beers left me feeling so sick that I hadn‚Äôt even wanted to take a drink after that.

However, Two days ago I got into a very frustrating situation where I just lost my self control and drink myself into a complete stupor and ended up in the hospital as a result. As far as I know no legal charges against me but I was in pretty bad shape in the hospital. 

What I am looking for is to try to build a support network so that the next time my life takes a frustrating turn off the tracks I‚Äôll have something in place maybe to help me not pick up that next drink. It‚Äôs not so much the day to day for me. I feel pretty good about not wanting to pick up and use, although that was the hardest thing to get past initially. Now my concern is that I‚Äôll be fine for the next six months maybe the next two years, something will occur and I‚Äôll be willing to flush it all down the toilet when the going gets hard. I have tried AA many times in the past and while I can certainly respect their willingness to help and respect the success others have had, it just didn‚Äôt work well for me and I am trying to find some other avenue of support. I live in the Northeast United States the western part of Connecticut.

Does anybody have any suggestions to build a support network in my area?

I do already see a individual counselor who has specialized training in substance-abuse. While I try to be as honest as I can with my counselor I am unable to detect a slow methodical downward spin from my emotions that leave me with a hair trigger to drink when something difficult occurs. 

My wife, God bless her, isn‚Äôt even mad with me obviously she just wants to help. She said that she had noticed a general downward spiral in my thought process and emotions. The reason I mention this is because I don‚Äôt see it and I think out of some misguided attempt to seem presentable and successful I must hide that from my therapist. Although it‚Äôs certainly not intentional.  I don‚Äôt even seem to notice it. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm not even sure what I‚Äôm looking for I just know that I can‚Äôt do this on my own anymore. Two years of sobriety isn‚Äôt good enough If it‚Äôs not followed with two years and one day, and while I‚Äôm not concerned that I am going to pick up a drink today or tomorrow or next week I am worried what will happen in six months. The best I can manage on my own is doing well most of the time and then having my thoughts and mood get corrupted start to get so low that it erodes all of my defenses against drinking. And once the right set of circumstances present themselves my disease has its hand around my throat once again. I can‚Äôt be having these problems any more in my life. I have to now plan ahead for what might occur two years from now or two months from now or two decades from now and be prepared to remove alcohols icy grip from my neck at any given time. I was hoping someone here might have a suggestion or two.

I tried to keep it together during the dance, not wanting to make a scene at someone's wedding or bring the mood down or make someone else's day all about me. A couple tears escaped but I mostly kept it together and was able to leave the room after the dance and go outside to have a little sob.

It occurred to me this morning that if I had been drinking as usual I would -not- have been able to keep myself together and I would have ended up making a messy, emotional scene right there at a table beside the dance floor.

Withdrawing at home was just too much, he needed comfort meds and professional supervision. Thank you guys for being here! Addiction is the enemy and together, we are a mighty army! xoxo  


I've posted here before about my 22 year old son's battle with heroin addiction and received amazing love and support. I havent updated anyone in a while but his last relapse was bad, and long story short, he's been MIA for about 8 months. Yesterday, he sent me a message of facebook, asking me to come get him. By the time I saw the message, he was no longer online. I knew what city he was in because people had told me they'd seen him around certain areas. So I filled my gas tank, drove out there and drove around for 4 hours until I found him. At a red light, I saw him crossing the street in my rearview mirror! I got him in the car and home, he has a bed at a detox lined up for Tuesday morning (earliest guaranteed spot) But for now, he is fighting it out in his old bed, I took the weekend off of work and am taking care of him.

Thank fucking God I am sober. There were so many times when he was little that I wasn't there for him, I let him down so many times cuz I was always fucked up, drunk, hungover, depressed. But I am there now, fully present and able to do whatever it takes. I think this time is different and he is going to commit to recovery. He's always fought rehab and went against his will, but this time, he begged for help, he cried, apologised a million times. Every other time he would be angry and blaming everyone but himself. It's been rough, but I will never give up on him.

I'm gonna start rambling, it's been the most emotionally exhausting 24 hours. Just wanted to say that this sub helped save my life, and because I am sober, I was able to save my son. I love you all, keep up the amazing work, rock stars!

I like who I am when I drink. I don't think so much. I'm so much more easy going and open-minded. Sometimes it helps me to say the things I wouldn't usually say that I need desperately to say, and I feel so relieved I have.

It really, REALLY makes me happy.

I also know it's not good. Relying on alcohol to express my reservations and emotional turmoil.

But.

Every night i grab my bottle of whisky and pour myself a nice full glass. And nurse it, with the ice ball. until it's all melted. If I finish the whisky before the ice melts, I top myself off and drink some more until the ice is gone.. Then I try to stop.

The thing is that I feel so HAPPY drinking it. Everybody is asleep. Fam is in bed. nobody can disturb me and I can enjoy watching dramas on TV for a bit without anybody asking me for something, or having to do anything.

Sometimes my partner is up with me.

He plays call of duty, or something and we sit in companionable silence doing our own thing. Sometimes I tell him what I'm thinking and we have a long discussion, or an argument about something important I wouldn't have otherwise brought up.

I end up sleeping at 2. or 3. just taking another 2 more cubes worth of liquor, until I'm convinced I need to get to bed so I don't fuck up tomorrow.

So far nothing bad has happened. Like I haven't hit on anyone, I don't take my inebriation out on even the wall or the door.

What do I do... I'm more worried for my body than anything. But I'm not hurting anyone.

Why shouldn't I be able to drink a little.. If it makes me happy?

Been a while since I checked in but I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm still on the wagon, and being sober is still BADASS. Here are some of the things that have happened in my life since being sober: 

1)Lost a bunch of weight and feel soooo much better! Friends and family have been very vocal about how much of a night and day difference there is. At first I was really hesitant to believe them. I found myself scrolling through Facebook the other day, and a picture of me from a year ago showed up. I immediately had to do a double take. I barely recognized that guy in the picture. The guy who was young but clearly looked older then his age. Anyways, that was an eye opener for me. 

2)My girlfriend finally moved in with me! We had been doing a distance relationship for over a year (her in MN, me in ATL). That was obviously a huge stressor on the relationship during the time we were apart. And myself, being completely new to the ATL area, used drinking to cope. I used it to ‚Äúfight‚Äù my loneliness. Or so I thought. In reality, it was probably preventing the one thing I actually wanted to happen from happening for even longer. I‚Äôm ecstatic to say she is finally down here and I haven‚Äôt been this happy in god knows how long. 

3) I‚Äôm not nearly as selfish. There isn‚Äôt nights where I want to stay out until the wee hours of the morning with no regard for how anyone else feels about it. When I was drinking, it was all about me and getting that next drink. I only realize now how some of my behavior back then was actually quite manipulative. Plus now I just want to do more things for people. I find myself going above and beyond to help people now because why not. With so much time and energy at my disposal, anything less would be unfair. 

4) reconciling with my past and who I was in the present scenario: there has been times over this journey where my past will come up. Things I‚Äôve done as a drinker, that mortify me as a sober person. I have had to come to terms with these things. It‚Äôs been a battle to remind myself that I am not those mistakes. Yes, they‚Äôre mistakes I‚Äôve made. But they don‚Äôt define me. 

The real reason I am making this post is because a thought popped into my head the other day. ‚ÄúHey man, you‚Äôre 90 days in. You‚Äôre good. You could probably have a beer now and be fine.‚Äù And I need to take the time now to say NO! Soooooo much no. So many beautiful things have been able to enter my life since starting this journey. I‚Äôm not going to throw it all away on some fleeting thought bullshit. I‚Äôm gonna keep pushing on and see how far the road I‚Äôm on goes. I hope you all will make the journey with me!

I have been drinking heavily for the best part of the last ten years. I had many (way too many) rock bottoms, and real ones. And despite them I kept on drinking, thinking ‚Äúwell, it can‚Äôt be any worse now‚Äù. I have completely given up on quitting alcohol the last year and I must admit I do not even remember who I actually am without being drunk or hangover. 

People might say that I am a ‚Äúfunctional alcoholic‚Äù as I am a solicitor and I don‚Äôt miss days at my work, but I am far from being functional. I am either spending my morning hangover in my office pretending I am working or trying to catch up with my cases when the headache and nausea start fading.

I have completely let myself go and I am utterly disgusted with my state. When I say I drink, I am talking about a fifth of hard spirit every other evening in one sitting. Sometimes two evenings in a row. It is bad. It wasn‚Äôt that much until quite recently but the last year ha seen the quantities gradually but steadily rise to that level.

I had my last drop of alcohol 17h ago. The first 24h are usually ok and then my brain goes on self driving mode and I buy another bottle the day after. Anything will trigger it, any little thing : a bad day, a good day, a rainy day, a sunny day, literally anything will be used as an argument to buy and drink. It‚Äôs Saturday, and normally I would use the extra free morning as a reason to binge. Hopefully not today. 

I think the worst is that I feel completely powerless over despite all my ‚Äúcommitments‚Äù and promises to myself. So this weekend will be a proper test as I am committing not to me but to you guys. I don‚Äôt know any of you but if writing this today can make me get some sense of accountability, I‚Äôll take it.

So now I think I'm experiencing depression because.... well... life can kick you around sometimes. And maybe I'm also feeling it more because I'm not drinking? Is that possible? So I may want to see someone to medicate. I think I want a break from this down feeling before it gets too dark. 

Anyone experience depression after quitting drinking? What did you do? I want to exercise but haven't had motivation to make the time. Bit of a cycle.... not motivation, depression, depression, no motivation... etc....

- if I can‚Äôt make AA I listen to podcast and or recovery stories on YouTube. Just search sobriety, AA, alcohol effects etc. always find something to zone out to, driving or at home

- I don‚Äôt run or ignore the craving as it
Comes on - Instead I use as a brain exercise, to train my brain to recognize it, feel it and consciously take a breath and tell/remind myself that that‚Äôs not
Coming from anywhere or anyone that wants me to be healthy, nice try go away etc. hoping that repetition will eventually become a reflex. Feeling it knowing it‚Äôs really not that bad and only lasts minutes at most

I have a vague feeling that for me personally it is related to my drinking, which is related to my emotional resilience and stress-management. 

Sometimes I can miss a meal (in transit or a meeting runs long) and it's fine. I eat as soon as I can afterward and as long as it doesn't become a habit no harm done. 

Other times, especially in conjunction with other stresses, I'll miss a meal (this morning for example I had an accident in the kitchen and needed to attend to that instead of eating breakfast) and then go into a deep dark spiral. I get the kind of Eff-Its that used to be a precursor to a binge. And the kicker is that this mood shift lasts even after I've fed myself. 

Anyway, it's puzzling. If anyone has any insight into this I'd love to hear it. Obviously the solution is to not miss meals, however there are some occasions when it is unavoidable.

I  always thought the stint into sobriety had to be perfect - that it would just automatically ""click"" and there would be no craving or debating in my mind.  I thought the minute I wavered, I might as well just give in and start over the next time hoping for ""perfect"".  I thought leaning on ANYTHING to get you through wasn't allowed.

There have been several times when the accountability of having come clean to my husband stopped me from falling off; times when I had an important meeting that prevented me from making a mistake; playing the tape forward in some cases helped too.

I guess I realize it doesn't matter what you have to use to get you through each craving, as long as you abstain and make it through.  Whatever it takes.  This thing isn't perfect, it's a process, and you keep going.

Among other things, it's the last time I had a compulsion to drink.","I've told this story before, but we have new people here and I think there are is at least one point that bears repeating - **no matter what, there is no reason you HAVE to drink.** There is a corollary I will save for later. 

20 years ago I was working in lower Manhattan on the 24th floor with a clear view across some lower buildings to the WTC.  We were watching the first building burn when the second plane hit. So much fire. Watched the plate glass window bow from the shock wave. Our building's HVAC took in the smoke and set off the alarms so they said ""get out"".

It was beyond bizarre, there were pieces pf paper everywhere, smoke, a thousand sirens,  and the huge crowd making its way through the streets was silent. I made a conscious decision not to stop (as some did) and watch the jumpers.  Somewhere in the narrow streets there was a bar, one of those hole in the wall places, the door stood open darkness inviting, and for the first time in more than ten years I felt those phantom hands tugging me. Hard. I knew the feeling well, because it had controlled my life for too many years.  And I did what I had learned in AA - put  one foot in front of the other and in a few seconds I was past and safe.  At the moment I recognized it as a 'holy shit' moment, one of many that day, but worth remembering.

The corollary - **there is nothing a drink can't make worse, sometimes a LOT worse**  Fifteen years later I was a volunteer at an AA meeting in a state prison and I told this story.  One of the men said, ""I got drunk that day"", and went on to describe how he'd seen it (he was in a crowd like mine somewhere else in the city) and had gone to a liquor store on his way home. He had a year or so sober at the time.  One thing led to another and another and another and here he was sitting in a circle of chairs in a state prison maybe for the rest of his life for having killed somebody as a result of drugs and alcohol some years later.  

I will end with a list of the things I have not had to drink over; the things I did not make worse because I drank.

My parents each developed long lingering ailments and died.  My marriage could not be saved and I got divorced. (not being drunk and keeping that from becoming a war is huge). Eventually I dated and remarried. My daughters got married. I was stuck in a rut at work for years. I managed to find a way up and out and to have success at work.  I took early retirement, I wrote a novel or two and almost got one published twice only to have a fickle industry slam that door in my face. I followed another dream and restored an old sailboat  only to discover my wife was not suited for ocean voyages. There have been health issues as we age, a beloved dog died, a new puppy got trained - this whole shitshow that's going on now, it's a very long list. 

I have gratitude that I was able to be an adult with my parents at their ends, that I did not make an ass of my self at my daughter's wedding, that I was able to retire because I  got promotions rather than being fired at work --- life is good.  All because I kept walking that day.",118,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4927907}"

Alcohol Thoughts

1. ‚ÄúAlcohol doesn‚Äôt permit one to do things better but instead causes us to be less ashamed of doing things poorly.‚Äù ‚ÄîW. Osler
2. 'If I want to be the heroine of this story I must stop drinking.' 
3. 'One drink is too many and a thousand is not enough.'
4. The Low Point - never forget.
5. Play it forward.
6. Start something new. Sing in public, be open, honest and kind.
7. Symptoms when I quit:
     Headaches for ten days
     Seeing shadows
     Exhaustion
     Fuzzy brain
     Felt ill like coming down with something.
     14 days to feel ok. 
     Brain still not right 42 days later.
     Don't forget days 3/4 were rubbish. The same days you        would ordinarily have a drink.

8. 'We are happier when we take a drink, not because drinking makes us happy, but because the drink relieves the withdrawal that drinking caused.'

9. Remember that constant thinking about drink, when the next drink would be, how many drinks, drinks over the weekend, living for the next drink and Friday nights. Always so excited for dinner, wake up in the morning and not even remember eating it.

10. Focus on the long haul. What do you want when you are 60!

11. 'If you retain the desire to drink, you will spend the rest of your life wondering when it will be a good time to have that next drink.'

12. Is someone in control of their drinking? Do they seem unable to have a good time if they are unable to drink?

13. Alcohol is society‚Äôs most dangerous addiction, causing four times as many deaths as prescription and illegal drug overdoses combined.

14. The fear of never being able to drink again is replaced by the excitement of never having to drink again.

15. 'Some drinkers think quitting is like losing a best friend. You know the truth: This friend is actually a backstabbing fiend who wants to slowly kill you by destroying your body and your mind. This friend is your mortal enemy‚Äîwho, if given the chance, will keep you engaged in a horrible, confusing battle until your death. Don‚Äôt let him. Kill him now and forever.'

2021-09-11 02:26:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pm25xb/an_alcoholic_like_me/,An Alcoholic Like Me,"My name is Kristen W and I am an alcoholic.  I have felt the need to share my story for some time now.  I'm hoping that if I tell it honestly, the way my Higher Power directs me to tell it, that I may reach another alcoholic, wherever they may be and show them that recovery is possible.  We are not alone.  I just celebrated my year Wednesday and I wouldn't have made it without the support of my now fiance, my family, my closest friends, and my sponsor, or without fellow alcoholics like me sharing their experience, strength, and hope with me.

I considered myself atheist for years, it is only now that I have come to believe in a Power greater than myself.  I don't know if this is necessary for everyone but in my case, I had spent my whole life wishing that I could believe in God.  I never dreamed that at 30 years old I would discover a spirituality that made me feel as fulfilled and grateful as those people in church who throw their hands up to the sky and say Hallelujah, Glory to God.  Now, I'm not going to say that my vision of a Higher Power is the same as theirs.  I am still not quite sure what my version looks like.  I used to prefer spirituality in terms of thinking of The Universe.  I have a friend who prefers his God to be thought of as a fat old guy named Larry.  Possibly my God is a woman.  Most likely God and the universe are one and have no definitive characteristics as far as the physical goes.  I have sometimes pictured it as everyone has their own individual God and when called to materialize takes their personal shape, like a Patronus.  But anyway, my God has been moving me to tell my story, and here it goes. 

I grew up in a very small town in Kentucky and it is here that I still reside.  I am what I consider to be lucky in that I have gotten out of this small town thought not far and not for long.  It's the kind of small town where, despite the presence of many churches and many Christians, alcoholism and the drug pandemic has touched every home in some way.

From a young age I was taught by personal experience that alcohol, and as I grew older, drugs, were a perfectly acceptable outlet to indulge and overindulge in on a pretty frequent basis.  Got a new job?  Drink!  Having a nice dinner?  Drink!  It's a weekend?  Drink!  Had a bad day?  Drink!  Feeling the stress of day to day responsibilities?  Drink!  My mom was young and a single parent most of my life and is still unlucky in love.  The example she set for me was that drinking was required to elevate, escape, and enliven.  

Those early memories of adults of all sorts, family and friends, friends we were supposed to consider family, are recalled mostly fondly.  Me being the ""mature"" child that I was, always seemed to be the last child awake in those late nights/early morning hours when the grown ups were playing such hits as ""Picture"" and ""Bent"" and Rollin'.""  I can still recall watching that Disney Channel movie with Carrot Top late at night upstairs while the adults were downstairs partying in the basement like the night was never going to end and having to resort to harder and still harder methods of hanging on to that feeling.  Ten year old me was fascinated.  The way they seemed to transcend their earthly bodies and find freedom from their loneliness and personal prisons.  Like I said, I was only ten, but I was a mature ten.  Ha.

Of course the morning always came (or late afternoons) and the mistakes of the previous night had to see the light of day but no real consequences seemed to befall this young invincible lot.  At this same time, 10 year old me was being felt up by my 14 year old step brother and being propositioned for sex, which I consented to even though I had no idea what it was.  I did not have sex at 10, I am not entirely sure if it was a situational thing or he had a moral epiphany that maybe that wasn't what he should do.  Either way, I am grateful that I do not have that experience, and it's kind of one of those memories where you're not entirely sure it happened at all, it feels so surreal.

That's kind of how I feel about all of my early memories and it's how I feel about much of my adult life due to my heavy drinking.  In thinking of my drunken memories, most are shameful and I do not feel I need to recount all of them, nor risk reliving the darkest stories.  It is important to remind myself that I don't live that way anymore, the past is the past and I can no longer afford to stay in or dwell on those memories, nor drink with regret over what was done to me or what I did to myself because to do so would be to choose death and today I choose life.

My story is not one only involving alcohol or alcohol abuse, as so few are singularly focused.  My story is one of neglect, both from others and myself, psychological afflictions, emotional shortcomings, developmental delays, spiritual unrest, and personal trauma.  There are times I have been at fault in most scenarios, things I wish I could take back or redo, things I wishes for a long time had never happened.  But you know what they say, wish in one hand and shit in the other... or something like that.

I don't remember the first drink I ever took.  Probably I was very young and one of the role models of my model nontraditional upbringing had thought it was funny.  I do remember the first alcoholic beverage I had chosen to consume, by myself, in the garage when I was 12 and my mom had moved in with her best friend, now deceased from an overdose after what had seemed to be her recovery.  How tragically we are lost when we choose to take that first drink.  I don't remember much about that first drink, only that there was a second, then it was gone and I was sad.

12 was also the year I started smoking, tried weed, and started cutting myself.  Weed was never my thing.  I still smoke cigarettes today.  I no longer self harm, at least not in that way.  But first came the drink.

Cutting was the most accessible form of addiction to me in my early youth.  It is not healthy for me to dwell on it today but doing it and the reasons why remain some of the biggest literal scars that haunt me today.  It is also important to note that I have never received proper treatment for self mutilation and I ""cured"" myself of that addiction by early adulthood, thus beginning my mentality that I do not need outside help.  Or did not.  

I didn't get into much trouble in my youth.  Always did well in school, hid my self harm, hid my smoking.  Always had some boy that I was obsessed with, had friends that I connected with but never on a real, personal level.  The trusted adults in my life did not notice anything awry, because I was good at hiding it, they had their own issues, and/or they were just plain oblivious.  After all, I was mature for my age and too smart to need to worry about.

The problem with being mature for your age for me was that I seemed to be stuck with the mentality of an ""almost adult"" for many years, far longer than is appropriate as displayed by my credit score and general state of just getting on my feet existence. 

Speaking of problems drinking, at first, was't a problem for me.  For a long time I did not, nor did anyone close to me, view it as a problem.  At first I only drank in the so-called normal way of teenage, small town youth.  Say, in a field at a tailgate party or in the burnout's cool mom's basement.  Being socially awkward and not younger than 17, I only drank a little, enough to make less those feelings of social inadequacies.  Actually, not true.  I experienced binge drinking when I was 16 and my mom was dating a crack addicted truck driving drug smuggler.  My mom had also graduated to crack addiction by this time.  I choose not to reflect too much on these times, that lasted a few months but felt like an eternity, particularly in those formative years where a solid foundation had not been built.  In fact, my brain, I'm sure in an effort to protect me, like to ""forget"" about these times.  But this recollection does bring me full circle because the boy I was obsessed with at 16, a terrible influence and a 16 year old addict ( I was as well, though I didn't know it yet), was the main influence of my first binge drinking episodes, but I wasn't with him long and went back to the milder drinking of a few at field parties.  But I did end up back with him by the time I was 18.

I was beginning to be more advanced by this age with my drinking.  I discovered both drinking for a good time and drinking as an escape.  I didn't realize it at the time but I was on my way to very serious patterns of drinking and further and further extremes to make the pain go away.  So after I dumped this treat of a by now man who cheated on me, got the girl's name tattooed on his neck, SPELLED IT WRONG, and still tried to be with me, I wound up with the next influential man of this story of my spiral into madness.  

This next guy I dated was a little older, far more experience with drinking and other things and introduced me to the life of hard drinking, sleeping it off, partying again the next day, calling in to work for a hangover or coming in late looking like death and thinking no one notices, then going and doing it all over again after work.  This man and I spent the entire summer in this cycle until the end came near, his old friend got out of jail, and I pulled myself out of his ass long enough to look at this new guy.   Of course he was new and mysterious, I had known my current boyfriend since we were children and in this small town I didn't know this bad boy who had seen things.  

My first red flag should've been jail I guess, or even that he broke probation on the daily to get smashed.  But it wasn't.  It wasn't that he disrespected women, or even when he had late night, drunken, scandalous sex with his close friend's girlfriend (me.)  No, my first red flag was when he sodomized me without neither asking nor receiving my permission.  All these years and I still try to avoid the word rape.

Again, my brain shields me from these things.  My brother asking me to have sex with him when I was 10, my mom and former step dad divorcing because she was a suicidal addict and cheated on him and he hit her, my mom then turning to crack and other drugs.  I even forgot about a sociopathic boyfriend she had between those events.  His friend molested me and my sisters.  Not to mention the vague memories of visiting my mom in mental wards for severe depressive episodes and suicidal tendencies.  The crazy aunt who when I was 9 showed me razor blades and told me my mom was planning on slitting her wrists.  Teaching me what slitting your wrists and suicide were.  The vivid memory of me throwing said razor blades deep into the woods.

My point is, I barely remember so much of my life.  Early on it was to protect myself from that which I didn't know how to process or respond.  Later it was because I drank too much and my mind just shut off, having what I thought was a good time.  Still later it became both.

At first the days after drinking were hazy.  After the rape, I experienced my first black out.  Before that time, I had thought that blacking out was a way for people to not have to take responsibility for the things they had done while drunk.  I woke up after my first black out in my bra and underwear on my boyfriend's dad's chair.  I had no memory of how I got there from the pool party down in the holler the night before.  I was told that I was lewd to several of the men there, in front of my boyfriend, tried to touch someone's dick in the pool (not my boyfriend's) and passed out in the pool and had to be carried out by my future husband (small towns.)

I'm getting too wrapped up in the details.  But that was the circumstance of my first blackout.  Of course everyone chalked it up to youthful indiscretion and so it could have been except that it was only the start of worse to come.

Fast forward 10 years and I have a child with my rapist, divorced the guy who carried me out of the pool that night of my first blackout, and had cheated on him with the guy who was the boyfriend when I was raped.  Oh, the tangled webs we weave, especially in small towns.  

So we see that basically, I was a mess, my life was a mess, and I felt there was no hope.  I didn't know a better way to live because I hadn't been taught one. With this Labor Day weekend passing, and knowing that the last one a year ago was the last time that I drank and I didn't know that it would be, I kept thinking that I'd like to go back and tell myself that it would be the last time, possible for forever.  But you know what I realized?  That it wouldn't have made a difference because I already went as hard as I could like I did nearly every time that I drank and that I already fucked up as hard as I could (as evidenced by it being my last straw event), and I couldn't do it any better in the worst way even if I tried.  That thought, as fucked up as it is, brings me a lot of peace now. 

So at this point I'll just tell you,  I quit drinking 9/8/2020 because I hurt someone very close to me while I was black out drunk and it just happened to be to someone sober with a good amount of time and they realized that the behaviors I was so good at hiding and spinning that it wasn't my fault and I only went too far sometimes because the alcohol.  Well, they put me to the test.  I'd made the decision to stop drinking many times over the years but I did not ever stop until now. 

So 9/8/2020 I went to my first AA meeting but the first one I was hoping against hope that I didn't really need to be there.  I went to a few in those early days and it helped.  But I still struggled daily with that first step.  Admitting I was Powerless over alcohol, that my life was unmanageable.  Well, I thought, I'm not powerless, I'm just weak and lazy and if I really wanted to be better then I could.  Any my life isn't unmanageable I thought, I'm making it there are just some bad days but they're not all bad.  And there are some bad times drinking but they're not all bad.  I guess I kept thinking that it would all pass and that there was no need to give up my safety net forever. 

As it turns out, i don't have to give it up forever.  The good news it that I still have the choice.  So basically I can drink as much as I want as often as I want to, my choice has not been taken away.  I'm just learning to build a life that I don't want to escape from.  And I'm doing that by working the AA program.  I'm doing it by consulting my HP.  I'm doing it by browsing and occasionally posting on this sub.  It took me awhile to get comfortably stating or identifying myself as an alcoholic and I still struggle.  These support groups have shown me a better way to live I've got my AA with their program and cans and not can'ts and I've got my stopdrinking subreddit where I am not alone and 300,000ish people are not drinking with me today or tried not to or are thinking about trying not to. 

The truth is, recovery is painful.  Healing is painful.  Growing is painful.  Recovery can also be very isolating and boring and in general just feels like you're raw dogging life.  But when I started to see those small changes and those sacrifices add up, I started to realize that this life can still be anything I choose to make it.  And I want it to be beautiful.  I want my life to make the lives of those around me better just by being here.  I wasn't to far gone to be saved from myself.  Today I'm grateful to know that I'm an alcoholic because that knowledge has saved my life.  Today I'm grateful to be an alcoholic like me.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is**: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

I am 18 months sober after a 20 year alcoholic cokehead bender.   I got sober with my sister's help out of state for 6 months and then made a go of it on my own in a new place for a whole year.  This is my first real adult foray into sobriety. 

Things were OK but I couldn't pull it together and my demons were chasing me and alcohol was calling me harder than it's been the last year and a half.  I threw my tail between my legs and ended up at my fucking mother's doorstep at 38 years old saying I needed a jump off and get myself situated back in my home state.  

She didn't tell me to fuck off like I thought she would because she believed I was still sober.  We talked and agreed I could stay for a month and resituate myself if I got myself into therapy (something we both know I've needed for over 2 decades). 

Well, that was the 5th.  As I'm writing this now I received a decent job offer in my home town and luckily found an apt opening up on the 15th and since I have not been drinking there is actually money in my bank account for the deposit. 

All in all I will have spent 10 days in my mom's house and still have not fell off the wagon. Writing this I feel a little less embarrassed and thought maybe you guys would enjoy the story.

I have agoraphobia with panic disorder so don't leave the house often and *never* without my brother or father.

But tonight was the fifteen year reunion for our group of people that worked together at the time.  We were a really close-knit group that drank together almost every weekday and most weekends.  My best friend from back then offered to drive me there and back and his wife was ready to take me home if I panicked, so I figured, ""why not?"" 

I expected my first craving.  Drinking was really all we had in common other than working together.  I have years of muddled memories of drinking binges that seemed fun at the time.  I also hadnt been in a bar since I quit drinking.

I didn't have a single craving, to my surprise!  I was even more surprised that one of the guys I worked with--one I thought never liked or respected me--had gone sober and hosts an NA meeting--we got along well, tonight.  We all looked about the same as when we worked together but he looked much happier and healthier than I remembered.  People told me I looked happier, too.

I wouldn't recommend running to the bar without a plan, though.  My dad, my brother, and a good friend of mine were ready to text or chat if I found myself even considering a single drink.  My buddy's wife also would have drove me home if I couldn't hack being in a bar.  Before I left home, I reviewed my DBT index cards so my coping, assertiveness, and boundary setting skills would be fresh in my mind.  I also made sure I had Lyft installed and had a valid method of payment: as nice as she was about it, I wasn't going to spoil my ride's good time if I didn't have to. 

My dad and brother told me how proud they were of me for going and for not drinking.  It feels great.

I know alcohol misuse disorder is often comorbid with other mental illnesses so I just want people here to know that YOU CAN ACHIEVE MORE THAN YOU THINK!  Even if you're on day one of umpteen tries, with a good support system, good coping skills, and the desire to abstain, you can do it!  Eventually, even in the face of triggering people, places, and events.

Thanks for all of the inspiration from everyone that posts, from old timers to those just considering not drinking.  And thanks for allowing me this forum to toot my own horn!

When I went to start everything at the stove, I notice that the garlic I'd roasted was gone. Asked where it had gone and she owned up to tossing it because she thought it wasn't for the meal.

I completely lost my cool as it had taken 45 min to roast (working on that temper) and it turned into a big fight. Arguments are a massive trigger for me and I reaaly wanted to order wine for delivery.

I‚Äôm struggling with a few things that I‚Äôd love some old-timer insight on, particularly identity. 

I‚Äôve spent the past 15~ years forming an identity around being THAT guy. THAT guy, who is first to suggest a 4:15 happy hour and THAT guy who is the first one to suggest that the Tuesday happy hour turns into a reason for everyone to stay out and ‚Äúbond‚Äù and THAT guy who enables everyone else to have an extra beer/cocktail/glass of wine/etc. I guess it was fun. I got a lot of satisfaction out of it. It also helped me hide the fact that I was a nightly blackout-drunk alcoholic. Same old story, I know. The point here is: being an alcoholic, albeit an alcoholic disguised as ‚ÄòThe Party Guy!‚Äô was my identity. 

I‚Äôm really excited about not drinking. I feel great and I‚Äôve largely lost my taste for booze and have no interest in picking up a drink again. I‚Äôve been reading a bunch of memoirs of recovering drunks and it‚Äôs been really helpful. The problem is, I feel like now my identity (and again, I know, I‚Äôve only been here for less than a month‚Ä¶) still surrounds alcohol, only now the identity is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drink.‚Äù 

I ride bikes. I do standup comedy. I am an economist. I am an empathetic person. I am an activist. I want these to be my identity, but I feel like the direction I see most people go that have been here is to make ‚Äòrecovering alcoholic‚Äô the largest font identity on their human ID card.

New Bridge saved my life, plain and simple.  I will forever be indebted to their staff for their support and pushing me beyond my limits.


Before New Bridge i was sleeping in a tent and my Dad was getting calls from the hospital and crying on the phone to the hospital staff.  They told me I had a blood alcohol content of 0.6.


I have some stats here:
At 0.2 blood alcohol levels most people begin to experience blackouts
At 0.3 blood alcohol levels many people lose consciousness
At 0.4 blood alcohol levels most people lose consciousness and some die
At 0.45 breathing stops, this is a fatal dose for most people.  


0.45 breathing stops, fatal for most people.  I had a blood alcohol content of 0.6 and was somehow still conscious.  It‚Äôs a miracle I am even alive and able to put sentences together today.


Im still early in recovery, but I think setting goals for yourself can be a big motivator in your sobriety.  I have some fairly modest goals of having a decent paying job a wife and maybe a family one day.  I know without a doubt that I will not be able to reach these goals or any goals really if I have one drink.
 
 For a long time I tried to reach my goals while drinking, but that was hard.  I would try to get really fit, so I would count my calories.  The problem with this was that I would drink over 1,500 calories of liquor then I would only have 500 calories left for actual food.  I was such an alcoholic that I kept doing this for awhile and in my head that made sense.  It‚Äôs like playing a video game on ultra hard difficulty.  I would try to do good at work, but I would get so blacked out I would end up in the hospital, then try to get myself together to make it to work the next morning.
  I was such an alcoholic I showed up for a school presentation completely blacked out and have no idea what I did or said.  I went to a job interview completely blacked out.  I went on first dates completely blacked out.  I could go on and on.  
  
  I have this strange sense of confidence now that I can handle situations that used to baffle me.  It really is like I have been playing life on hard difficulty for 10 plus years and now I‚Äôm playing on normal difficulty for a change.
  I want to thank Geirge for being like a best friend even though he has been distant recently.  He would always give me these affirmations saying to ‚Äúbelieve in yourself‚Äù.  Hope he knows I got his back if he ever needs anything.
  I want to thank George for being a great counselor and role model.  
  I want to thank George for teaching me to ‚Äúlearn how to have a bad day‚Äù.  I‚Äôll never forget that one.  He also taught me to do what‚Äôs uncomfortable because that‚Äôs how you grow as a person. 
  Thanks to George for just seeming like a friend and mentor the whole way through and looking forward to beating you in softball one day.
  Thanks to George for being strict in a good way and always checking in with me.  For being funny too.
  Thanks to George for pushing my buttons, the closest I came to losing it was when he took away our workout privileges, but I know it came from a good place.
  Thanks to the entire staff really.   George had a big influence on me and helped me get honest. 
    I‚Äôm learning to look forward to being uncomfortable now.  Before the thought of discomfort made me run to the bottle.  Now I see it as a chance for growth.  Thank you.

I was at work when it happened. My neighbor was kind enough to keep me posted even before she was sure it was in fact him. When I got home from work, the hell week it's been..I went to go see if it was him, and it was. Someone had already buried him (which I do think was kind.) And thr guy that hit him knocked on every door in the neighborhood and was distraught enough to leave a message on my neighbors ring camera, and placed Fred in her yard. He was already gone. 

Fred was an indoor/outdoor cat. Mostly outdoor. We found him in our garage in February, close to death, sick and severely emaciated. I got him the vet care he needed, and I nursed him back to health. He was so fucking happy, always. He was my best friend, and I'm not even a cat person. I just felt a connection with him instantly. Everyday he waited for us to wake up, for us to get home, and jumped on our door whenever he wanted to be let in for some love and cuddles. He stole my heart. 

I feel devastated. I brought him back home and buried him in the garden, after sobbing over him and telling him I was so sorry. I keep thinking I'd I would have let him in the house today this wouldn't have happened and that it's my fault. He was chasing a chipmunk when he was hit. 

I just keep crying. My first thought was wanting to drink because this is so fucking painful. But I didn't. Tomorrow is another long day of tears and frustration. I'm overwhelmed and depressed.  I feel like a horrible person. How could I let this happen? I feel like I failed him.

2021-09-10 20:33:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/plx65c/today_was_rough_my_moms_drinking_really_hit_me/,Today was rough. My mom's drinking really hit me hard," Today was a wreck and that's probably the best way to put it. For some background, my mom has been an alcoholic for pretty much my entire life, not as noticeably as it has been the last couple years, but it's definitely become less and less ""functional"" especially since I started the sobriety journey 5 years ago (and I'm 1.5 years sober)  I for the longest time have had the boundary of ""I won't talk to you about your drinking if you won't talk about mine"" which has been helpful to us in the past but man today was ROUGH and I think might change that. She's a super talented seamstress, so she's fixing a dress for me, and I also happened to need a new bra specifically for this dress so we went to Victoria's Secret. First hint that she had been drinking was the fact that I HAD to drive, if she's sober enough to drive she refuses to be a passenger. Second was JUST how talkative she was with the woman helping us out, like my mom isn't one of those ""tell your life story to everyone you meet"" people and this woman at VS basically knew the entire story of how I'm in this wedding from how the bride and I met (at age 5) onward during the time I was trying the bras on. Back at home, I'm in the other room talking to my stepdad and my mom is cooking and will randomly jump in to parts of our conversation and just like isn't on topic WHATSOEVER, eventually it turns into about a 30 minute fight between her and my stepdad where my stepdad is repeating himself over and over, is asking how much shes been drinking, my mom is not fairing well in this argument as she has admitted she was drinking. I mean he was getting straight up nasty with her. I ended up texting my stepdad ""hey, I'm going to go smoke, tell mom you're just checking on me or something and come outside"" and I sat him down and explained to him that while I understood where he was coming from and the frustration he was feeling, the absolutely berating way he was talking to her was NOT helping the situation. His answer was ""she's not even going to remember this in 2 hours."" and I was like ""oh no...she'll probably remember. She'll pretend like she doesn't, but she most likely will. At least pieces of it. I'm an outsider on this, I don't live with you guys anymore and I haven't for 10 years, I don't see the day to day, but what I can tell you is that from your interactions when I did live here and the ones you have had since I've been coming over more often is that you shift all blame of anything that happens to the drinking, you honestly don't ever let her finish a sentence ""because shes drunk and it won't make sense anyway"" and all that IS NOT MAKING ANYTHING BETTER, IT'S MAKING IT WORSE. We've gotten her to the point of considering treatment before, but then he ends up being an asshole about it and she reverts back to ""why would I want to endure this sober"" and it just starts the cycle all over again. And I think finally I may have phrased something in a way that made it click in his head because I definitely saw a ""click"" go off, not fully, but the start of one. That's really all I was hoping for. I wasn't looking to place blame or anything like that, more of a ""you are playing a hand in this, not a 'youre forcing the vodka down her throat' hand, but in the way you just told her how stupid she is, bringing up everything bad that has ever happened to her because she was drunk WHILE SHE IS CURRENTLY DRUNK and you KNOW she will just continue the argument going in circles."" hand. I was trying to explain that while, yes, he has known his wife for 20 years and knows her better than anyone and all that, I'm the one who is also an alcoholic and can see it from the alcoholic perspective and also, if we're getting technical, has ""known"" her longer (sarcasm - trying to make the situation a little less tense. It's what works best in my family)  I was sitting and thinking about how I was going to say all this during the 30 minutes I was listening to the argument. There were a few points where my mind jumped to ""interrupt them, say you're not going to listen to this and just walk out"" but that would have only ended up making things worse, and that feeling of REALLY wanting a bottle I dealt with the entire drive home might have been strong enough to make me stop at the store. I didn't though, my mom ended up passing tf out on the couch and yeah, she didn't act like she remembered any of it when she woke up and who knows, maybe she didn't really. But from all the stories I've heard and my experiences with it, she knows that something happened and will probably be piecing it together for the next day or so.   I wish I could help her more. I know I can't do anything more than I already have done which is told her honestly how I feel about things and hope she will reconsider at some point except for tweaking my boundary which is going to SUCK for me but I think I need to. I came way too close to losing my sobriety over someone else's today. I guess that's it. I had to write everything down to try and process it some more before I go talk about it in person with my boyfriend who is the man that divorced me due to my drinking - funny how life works out that way.

That's not my reality, has never been, and never will be. I don't have an off switch and never will. From the minute I started drinking as a teenager it was clear I did not have a normal relationship with alcohol. I drank to get blackout drunk. All of my drunk friends could still manage to recognize when it was time to go home and go to bed. I did not. They would go home and I'd stay out, finding random strangers to keep drinking with and winding up blackout drunk in strange places and dangerous situations. As an adult, after having kids, I felt like I had my drinking under control. I would only drink after putting them to bed, and I usually didn't drink more than a bottle of wine per night. But my dependence on it was the problem. I had to drink every night, and I couldn't start drinking too early, because once I started, I couldn't stop. The only thing that stopped me was sleep. Even at that, when I knew it was time for bed, I'd need to have several ""last sips"" and even still went to bed itching for more. I could not fathom skipping my evening wine even if I needed to for a medical procedure or due to a medication I was taking. I mostly drank alone but if I went out and had drinks with others, I still needed to come home and drink my usual amount of wine on top of the drinks I already had. I hate being drunk, I hate slurring my words, I hate waking up smelling like alcohol and tasting it, and I hate being hung over. I hate being dependent on it. I hate that I can't be normal about it. I saw a TikTok the other day where the person said, ""When I try to enjoy it, I can't control it, and when I try to control it, I can't enjoy it."" That's it in a nutshell for me.

I do real good for a while cutting back, the wife helps a lot with it.  The moment she stops ""nagging"" about it though because I've shown I'm doing well I slip back away from moderation.

How do you guys do it?  What is your motivation?

I went about a week without drinking a few months back.  I just couldn't stop the temptation when I stopped at a gas station to fill up.  I don't know how to.  I was pissed because the wife hadn't noticed I hadn't drank a drop in a week..... and said fuck it.

On the plus side me ""cutting back"" to 6-8 beers a night has caused me to lose almost 50 pounds in 6 months, so there's that.   Just to give you an idea of how much I used to drink.... 6-8 beers is ""Moderation.""  And I've lost a lot of weight by only drinking 6-8..  And I've completely cut out liquor.  Used to go through a handle in 3 days.... with beer.

Unfortunately, someone at the same table had a gin and tonic in the same glass, and of course I picked that up and took a swig.

I immediately got hit with just a hot flush of anxiety. I‚Äôve done so fucking well this time around, I‚Äôve made being sober stick. I am sober. I don‚Äôt drink. And I just drank. I was terrified a switch was gonna flip and that was it, I‚Äôd be knocking them back all over again.

It's a work trip but primarily a team building trip I guess. I've been managing same team of developers from there for the past two years, so my boss thinks it will be good to get to know each other. There's also been some issues with respect because I am a young woman in a technical role etc. and my boss says that if we bond it will be better.

I'd been apprehensive and putting off the trip for a handful of reasons, but a big one being that my boss talks about when he goes and they just drink a ton and become buds and run around the city. He showed pictures of his last trip there and they were just drinking, singing, clubbing. It honestly looked terrible. How is it supposed to help improve any relationships for me to go across the world, be the only woman among a bunch of guys who already barely respect me, and then go watch them all get drunk and wish I was home.

I've been sober for three years but have been under the radar about it. Like I just get seltzer and lime and don't mention it. And my boss is always pushing alcohol and wants other people to drink with him and he always will disclose like medical or personal stuff other employees tell him to the whole group so I really don't feel like having this discussion with him.

It was gradual, but when I started drinking during the day to calm my nerves/hangovers, I knew I had to stop. 

My last drink was on July 17, 2018, followed by an alcohol-free streak that lasted until mid-May this year. As I approached 3 years booze-free and the circumstances of the pandemic wore on, depression sank back in considerably. I hadn't *really* thought about drinking for most of those 2.5+ years, but it permeated my thoughts once again.  

There were a lot of decisions and factors involved in that decision (to have a drink), but the predominant voice that drove the decision = ""I'm in such a different place now, and I'm sure I could handle this now.""

Like many of you, I've struggled with unexpected job and life changes... navigating the pandemic with 2 young children under 10, while trying to balance my own health, seemed no longer feasible. I was holding on tight to the sense of health that I had at the time, but it didn't seem like enough. The pride that I had for not drinking lost out to my desire to ease the sense of despair. 

So ‚Äì on that day in May, I had some wine alone. I wanted to test things out (stupid, I know) before I tried to drink with anyone else. I felt awful about it, and decided that I couldn't handle alcohol in my life again. I was (and still am) disappointed in that decision, but it solidified my decision to not drink from back in 2018. I didn't get drunk, but drank enough to feel a buzz that only made things worse. 

I haven't found a good solution to the depressive episodes that have come back with a vengeance. I've tried a few anti-depressants and have a great psychiatrist that I have been working with. I wish things were easier, but I still find myself slipping back into a desire to drink again. 

I also haven't drank since that one slip in May, and I'm proud of that. Regardless, I was reminded of a trauma that I've experienced today, and I descended into the same ""f@#( it, I'm just going to drink to feel better for now"" track ‚Äì followed by scheming where I'd go, and how I'd hide it. 

I didn't, and I won't. This is so hard, though ‚Äì and I really hope it gets easier. My heart goes out to all of you that seek the same sense of peace that we won't find through ethanol.",14,{'pandemic': 2},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6299459}"

The limited series is built around a relapse the character suffers shortly into this first episode. I've watched a good number of films and series about addiction but this might have been the most painful and accurate depiction of a relapse I've seen. I actually couldn't watch - not because the character does anything extreme (I mean, it's extreme in its own way) but because the speed with which the self auto-destructs and the logic of the drunk breaking abstinence was too relatable and too sad to bear. 

I'm more convinced than ever that alcoholism is a physical, mental disorder that very possibly arises as a way of coping with traumas major and minor. It affects thought processes (even in remission) and is so definitely not a question of weak will.

It occurs to me after this last binge, and my lord, was it a bad one, that this whole week I have not been feeling jealousy and resentment of the normies and their ability to stop at 1 or 2. I just want to stop. It doesn't mean I stopped craving it. It just means, I simply want it out of my life. 

There's a weird catch-22 about it (for me anyway). It's like, as long as I keep thinking, ""Wouldn't it be nice if I could...?"" then I know I will still be caught in that drunk mindset. Because normies don't think that way. What is really so fucking nice about what they do? There is no glass of wine or mixed drink or beer that tastes better than a full sugar coke or a milkshake. Drinking 1 or 2 glasses of wine, slowly, over an evening, what is sooooooo nice about that that it requires obsession on my part? If it doesn't get you drunk, why do it??? 

""I wish I could drink like normal people"" means ""I wish I could get drunk without consequence.""

I thought that was weird but chalked it up to a coincidence. Two days later I‚Äôm on the phone in a heated conversation, emotions were running high so I had to calm down and go smoke a cigarette outside.

The second big challenge is that my boyfriend is coming over today.

so I've been lurking here for awhile and have found that reading about other people's journeys has been very inspiring.

I'm a DJ that's very focused on the craft, though I have a history of alcohol abuse and have recently started treatment for several mental health issues, and part of my self discovery has led me to understand that alcohol is extremely detrimental to my health in every way, and also to my recovery from these MH concerns.

I'm in the music industry and have been DJ'ing for a few years. I'm a member of VR communities (will not specify which as it's not relevant to this post) and my gigs are currently virtual but I find that the constant exposure to alcohol, be it in the context of playing virtual parties (with all your friends being beyond drunk each night) or real parties, often gets me tempted to drink. I'm an introvert that used to turn to alcohol as a ''social lubricant''. I'm into DJ'ing (and used to hang out at clubs pre pandemic) because electronic music is a big part of my life and is a passion I will always nurture, though I find the constant socializing and temptation to drink has become problematic and I'm working on ways to internally combat this.

I'd like to hear from the people here that are also in showbusiness (maybe other DJs or performers) that are often in environments where they're surrounded by drunk people, and what has your journey been like when it comes to resisting the temptation to get smashed with everyone else when you know for a fact you're an alcoholic, and one drink will lead to another and another until a blackout or at least a long term downward spiral are inevitable.

Sobriety allows me to value myself. I started eating better and working out more, and I got a physical where my cholesterol and BP all dropped to incredibly healthy levels!

Weekend and no where to go because of lockdown? Target has a crazy sale on ""Gluten Free"" Stoli, so may as well be economical and buy all 22 bottles on the endcap.

My aggression started getting uncontrollable, I ballooned to the highest weight of my life; even my underwear didn't fit anymore. When I see pictures of myself from back then, I'm embarrassed and disgusted. I can see the drunk on my face so obviously.

Sleep was torture. Up and down all night with anxiety, not noticing or caring if I peed all over the toilet, waking up with a feeling of guilt and dread, but not remembering why.

Then, a week before my last birthday, during a screaming fight about basically nothing, my wife said she wasn't attracted to me anymore when I was drinking. That was a proverbial bucket of cold water.

That was it. I looked at my fat drunk ass and said ""I hate you like this"" to myself. The next day I quit cold turkey and started tracking my weight and days without booze. Over time I got more involved with working out. I counted calories, but  the main thing is that 20 lbs fell off in a couple months just from dropping 2000-3000 calories of booze everyday and not binge eating crap when I was drunk.

I won't say it was an easy road, but definitely nowhere near the suffering I read about on this sub, and I feel so much for all the folks here who are trying their best and having a tough run.

So now I'm 365 days booze free, I'm going into my next bday in measurably the best shape of my life. Just had a physical and my Dr was thrilled with the progress. I'm a couple lbs away from normal BMI, which I plan to hit in the next couple weeks. I haven't had a screaming fight in a year, and I wake up every morning feeling good, instead of coming to and feeling shame. And no more limping through a daily hangover at work and getting through the day with hair of the dog, counting the hours until I can pour a really stiff one.

The pandemic gave me an excuse to hit a bottom; I won't say rock bottom, because it could have been worse. But I was very quickly transitioning from functional drunk, to just plain drunk. I looked in the mirror at how gross I had become and thought about all the great things in my life and the decision between a good life vs continuing drinking was an easy choice. To quote Irvine Welsh, I ""choose life.""

Luckily I had non-alcoholic drink options so I was able to go with that. My brain is still telling me it's not a big deal, but I'm getting better at ignoring it. I did appreciate not having the feeling of worrying that I was saying something inappropriate and not realizing it that comes with even one drink.

There was an interesting post on here yesterday about not deciding whether you had a problem by looking at other people because you can always justify your position in either direction. That got me thinking about what works for me in general. I realized we often come up with reasons not to drink, but we're rarely asked for reasons to drink. I had a hard time coming up with a really good reason to drink, at least in moderation. 

For me, one beer isn't going to do much. I might get a little spacey but I'm not really going to relax. If I do get to the point where I'm feeling good then I'll feel that ""let's do this"" tug. Pushing that away takes more mental energy than just not having a drink in the first place. Maybe not a deep realization, but probably worth more consideration.

Joined a few days ago. I haven't felt comfortable replying to any posts because I'm not quite sure where I am in my relationship with alcohol. 

Background: Typically, I'm a weekend binge drinker. For me this is about 1-1.5 bottles of wine every Friday and Saturday night. Sometimes an additional night during the week. Sometimes I skip Saturday night if I'm too hungover. But mostly Friday and Saturday nights. The very fact that it's a weekend seems to trigger my urge. It feels compulsive at times. Like my body is going through the motions of going to the store while my brain is screaming at me to stop.

&#x200B;

A week ago my son's dad (my ex-husband) died because he drank himself to death.  I drank quite a bit on the first few nights. More than a little ashamed at this even though I patted myself on the back for staying under a bottle most nights. Then, last Sunday night, even though I didn't have work on Monday, I just decided not to.  (My son is an adult and doesn't live with me so he didn't have to see it.)

&#x200B;

Anyway, I've got a lot of logistical stuff to take care of still, surrounding his death. And it's a Friday night. There's a chance that the fact that I have early morning things to do will be enough to stop me tonight. But I think I would like to just not drink anymore. 

&#x200B;

I would love to hear stories of people who binged on the weekends only. (But please feel free to share even if your story is different!) Yesterday, it felt like it wouldn't be a problem. But this morning, my brain is already sending the message that says, ""It's Friday!"" and without me even trying, it's like it starts plotting when in my evening it will be most convenient to buy wine.  I guess that being the weekend is my trigger? 

&#x200B;

I dunno. I'm up and at 'em right now and making a salad for work. So far my plan is to just keep reminding myself that I need to wake up at 5am tomorrow to help another living being. That might work tonight. But I'm not sure what will work tomorrow. Or the day after. Or next weekend....",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.51811916}"

I'm planning to do a lot of catch-up for some material I couldn't take care of this week, so avoiding drinking shouldn't be hard. I'm also going to do some light exercise and housekeeping, so I'm hoping I'm as ""back to normal"" as can be by next week.

Mostly, I discovered my self value is really low, if not non existent. Ive talked before about how I've gained weight, and I wish I could lose it. That being my main reason to quit drinking. But, I only hate looking fat, not being fat, if that makes sense? I don't care that I am fat, just that other people view me that way. 

So, I'm perfectly fine as long as I stay in my cave, no one ever sees me, and I can drink all the noise away. On top of that, I found I really don't care about any of the repercussions of drinking anymore. If I end up hospitalized or something, it'll just be some needed time off work.

2021-09-10 08:21:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pljxvr/why_im_here/,Why I'm Here,"Day 1. The real day one... 
Don't wanna make this super long but I feel like I need to post this here to help hold myself accountable, because I've been lying and hiding my drinking the past two weeks while pretending to be sober.

I turned 30 on Aug 8! And in the months leading up to my 30th I set the goal to get serious about quitting drinking. I'm a type 1 diabetic and I've been drinking pretty heavily the past 10 years. I've been to rehab for drinking in the past with some minor success... but ultimately never have had the drive to stay sober long term.

Anyways... I know i need to knock off this reckless drinking if I want to feel well in my later years! But my 30th birthday came and went. I just didn't FEEL like stopping. And I'd browse the SD subreddit and think to myself 'nah I'm just not ready yet. not yet..'

I've been working from home since March of 2020, and slowly but surely I started to drink during work. I work in the morning, like 9a-5p, and over the past few months it got to the point where I'd drink a pint of whiskey starting at 10am and finish sometimes as early as 3pm. No performance issues at work, was actually a top performer.. which helped me keep drinking. Got reaaalllyy used to drinking in the morning into the afternoon every single day.

Being a diabetic and drinking is a really bad idea. For me, once I've metabolized the alcohol my blood sugar will drop, which can be extremely dangerous. On this particular day we were running late making dinner and i didn't eat in time. My blood sugar dropped so low I lost consciousness. 

I don't remember what happened next, but I guess I went into a fit of convulsions and my wife had to call 911. The EMTs had to give me KETAMINE to get me to stop, and let me tell you..... it was the scariest thing I've ever been through.....

The next thing I remember I'm in the ambulance, but I'm on Ketamine and not aware that they gave it to me. I was literally tripping out, thinking I was in another dimension and stuck in some sort of perpetual confusion. I felt like this for what felt like hours and hours, and in reality it was a 20 or 30 min drive to the hospital. I was terrified and completely confused. That ketamine shit is no joke, and imagine not knowing you were dosed with it... absolutely nightmarish.
I got checked out at the hospital after the ketamine wore off and went home a few hours later. I thought to myself ""ok... I guess I'm ready to go ahead and stop drinking now...""

Well all of that happened a couple weeks ago and scared the shit out of me. Obviously if i keep drinking like this, something bad like this will happen. I'm lucky my wife was there to call 911! So I told my family I was done drinking. I did well for a few days.

So that brings me back to the beginning where I said I've been lying and hiding my drinking. And it sucks because I'm getting away with it, and it's selfish and just not right... eating me up a bit I guess.

So I'm telling a buncha strangers, haha. And as weird as it sounds, I think it will help me stay honest with myself and my loved ones. I have GOT to do this, I want it and I know I can do it.

My reaction - it new ground but was useful learning. It neither sucked nor was endless joy - it had ups and downs and it was harder some moments and way easier on others. I‚Äôve learned some great lessons for next time. On balance it was good, but I think activity/culture based vacations will be much easier/enjoyable for me than a ‚Äòlie by the pool‚Äô type vacation in future (or at least combine the two).

I discovered that my biggest craving (perhaps that‚Äôs too strong a word, but certainly romanticising) was during that period after you have returned to your hotel room to get ready before going out for the evening. That would always be an excuse to sit and ‚Äúread‚Äù on the balcony with a couple of beers waiting for others to finish getting ready.

Other than that, there were a few times by the pool where I was like ‚Äúa cocktail would be cool‚Äù - but lemonade, coffee and ice cream scratched that itch.

With dinner I had Non-alc Beers and always treated myself to a dessert. No real desire to drink after dinner, though I did have a few cigarettes. Top tip - have something to do/watch. Live music really did it for me - no desire to drink, I was just enjoying the music.

Airport/flight - this is the only part where I was really like wtf. I haven‚Äôt gotten all preachy, but - seriously guys - why the fuck is anyone drinking vodka on a 7am flight? Zero desire to be part of that. It‚Äôs so obvious to me now that airports/airlines just push this ‚Äòflying = drinking‚Äô narrative in order to make a cheap buck.

Then I start to think more concretely about alcohol. Like where I‚Äôll buy some and how I‚Äôll drink it. Usually this happens a day before my lapse. How do you manage these more concrete and intense cravings? Going for a walk doesn‚Äôt seem to help when they are intense. They come back stronger and stronger and take hours.

2021-09-10 02:58:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/plfxmn/i_want_the_old_me_back/,I want the old me back,"* First off this might be a tad lengthy, so maybe it won't be read through by anyone but I thought it's better to write it out in here(hopefully I'm in the right sub), and have the chance of someone having a familiar experience, than just writing itself in my notes draft..

&#x200B;

* I'm 31/M and for the better part of the last 3-4 years I have become an alcoholic. 

&#x200B;

* From 24-27, I never kept alcohol in the house. I was working out, and was in really great shape, getting over a girl who passed on me for someone else, and I never felt better or more confident in myself.

&#x200B;

* Right around 28 I found Twitch. I'm not a big gamer, but big enough to watch others play, try to learn from them playing the games I played, etc. But the biggest draw about it to be was the socialization aspect. My friend group was very small and was gradually, fading more away as everyone got older, had significant others, just adult stuff was making me more alone. I was really comortable not jumping into all that right away, but still wanted to ""socialize"". 

&#x200B;

* Again I wasn't drinking at this time..until one night one of the streamers I followed was doing a ""drunk stream"". I thought this seemed kind of fun and joined in, drinking along with the streamer, and a handful of others.

&#x200B;

* That night turned into 4 years of me having a routine. After winding down from the day, and maybe playing with IRL friends, I'd turn off my online status. Turn on a more relaxing game, and podcast to listen to, and start drinking. Thankfully it's always been beer, but nonetheless. 5-6 beers in I'd get into more competitive games, and actually did quite well playing buzzed. 8-12 beers later I was socializing in streams, still in control, but definitely socializing in a manner I wouldn't be.

&#x200B;

* Then the sun would start to come up and I'd usually be about 16 light beers in by 10 am. This is when I'd start messaging girls i knew, or starting up conversations in my close friends group chat at hours they didn't think I'd be up at. I hid this well for all but the last year..somehow I was never confronted by any close friends or girls, asking if I had been drinking or if I was okay or anything.
* The pandemic didn't help. Again the one thing I had the most in my sober years was the gym. I was still able to mix in going to the gym 2-3 times a week while also getting bombed the other couple nights of the week. I don't wanna use the pandemic as an excuse, but it didn't help.

&#x200B;

* In the middle of one of my all night into the middle of the day benders, I fell asleep on my desk head down on my arm, and woke up with no control over flexing my wrist. Commonly know as saturday night palsy. I didn't have use of this hand for almost 4 months. That didn't stop me from coming back telling myself I'd be more responsible once I started drinking again.

&#x200B;

* The messaging with girls became more aggressive, and I was angry with some of them (some justifiably but mostly it came off like I was looking for a fight or something, but I never needed to bother with them to begin with) I was making enemies pretty easily in some twitch streams (if someone came off like a tool or was just weird, I didn't hold back, and I didn't let up on them until I basically went to sleep) and then i would goto sleep for 5 hours and as soon as my eyes opened I knew everything I had said before I went to sleep and I was so embarassed and went off the grid.. until the next time I felt like drinking.

&#x200B;

* I miss the old me. I think part of it has to do with realizing the fact that I'm pretty lost in life in general and have been, even maybe before i started drinking, but the drinking obviously doesn't help. But I miss wanting to goto the gym. It's unbelievable that I haven't put on 30 lbs since this all started I've put on maybe 5 lbs but obviously lost muscle. But it's hard to even just go around the corner to the store. Every morning after I wake up I'm like ""ugh"" even if I don't plan on drinking that night or have been for a few days. The mental hangovers last for days if not not almost a full week for me now.

&#x200B;

* I wanna stop. I know I need more structure. I'm lucky in the fact that there's never been a time in my life where I've thought to myself or said aloud ""I need a drink."" I only wanna drink when I wanna relax on my own, but once it starts I go right through until I've gone through about 20 beers.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is**: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Here's Mark Epstein describing a ""spiritual summer camp"" he attended, and how he fruitlessly struggled to release the tension in his shoulders. His roommates teach him how to juggle:

""My breakthrough that summer came not during any formal meditation practice but from my experience of juggling. As I finally became able to keep three balls in the air, I noticed suddenly how quiet my mind had become. My everyday thoughts had vanished, and the tension in my shoulders was gone. I was momentarily undefended and curiously at peace. I wasn‚Äôt trying to relax, and I wasn‚Äôt trying not to relax. Everything was floating. I was no longer centered in my thinking mind.""

(From the book *Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart*)

Do you have a ""juggling""? Something that quiets your mind, puts you in this state of floating, undefended, peaceful? Mine is maybe gardening, though the mind does jump into that too, of course.

Hi everyone! This is my first time posting here but reading this sub has really helped me over the past year. It's a slightly unconventional 1 year post because I can't really say I've turned my whole life around, or everything is better, but I have learnt some invaluable lessons that I'd like to share with anyone just starting out in sobriety.

My point of no return came in the form of a serious illness resulting from years of drinking, drugs, and living in a state of constant stress. My body basically made the decision for me. That was just over a year ago and it has been the first sober year of my adult life.

I wrote a diary entry at the end of every month and it's only reading back now from the start that I barely recognise myself. My thinking was so self-involved and childish. Everything was everyone else's fault. Something I've learnt is that addiction puts you into stasis. I was still thinking like a teenager and the reason I always fell at the 1 month mark in previous attempts to get sober is because I would get hit with an overwhelming wall of unresolved emotions. I had to grow up 10 years in the last year. Throughout the first few months I was experiencing waves of intense empathy for others and reliving all these crucial life moments that I had only been a passenger for when they happened. I've learnt that you get better through pain. There was a reason you were punishing yourself with substances and that reason must be confronted head on.

The first 6 months for me were fairly chaotic. Moments of intense clarity and joy. Days of strong depression, sleepless nights being bombarded with memories. Things started to really calm down around 6 months in. I started to realise that full days would pass where I felt basically ok. Where I didn't worry about anything. This was a real gift for me. A lot of my anxious thought cycles started to unravel and I found myself able to relax for the first time I could remember.

This sense of calm grew through the next 6 months. I laughed on my good days and my bad days were different, somehow slower. No more frenzy of anxious thoughts; just slow days that could be waited out.

The main lesson that I've learnt in sobriety is that you can't always control the happy/sad axis of life. You will invariably experience the full spectrum of good and bad luck. What you can control is the light/heavy axis. You can go through adversity with lightness. Alcohol and drugs bring about heaviness. They make obstacles insurmountable. They give you emotional inertia. They fuel the anxiety that makes you fearful of change and shy away from challenges. At 1 year sober I no longer feel a constant vague longing. I can walk home at night without a sense of doom. I no longer feel a loss for the past or panic for the future - I've made peace with both. This is only the beginning of the real task of creating a meaningful and fulfilling life for myself but the most important gift of sobriety is that I'll be there, trying, enduring, as light as a feather.",38,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4715864}"

Mid day 2 here and I feel more confident about this second go-around. I really want to spend my money elsewhere, even though saving and eating in are all smart, frugal decisions.

I found this sub about a week ago, and i dont know why I didnt look sooner. I am an alcoholic. I started to suspect that I really had a problem about 2 years ago, but the thought had crossed my mind sporatically for a few years before that. I have occassionally ""Day drank"", but usually its half-a whole bottle of wine and 2-3 beers a night, and I almost always over pour my wine. Last weekend I did some research, and purchased ""This Naked Mind"", only on the first chapter, and I downloaded a sober tracker app. My goal is to use the rest of september to talk to my psychiatrist and taper down to do sober october. I have been visiting this sub and a few others everyday this week. I had one beer monday night. The hardest nights are thursday-sunday. Last weekend I managed 3 drinks a night, and this weekend my goal is 2 drinks a night; dangerous I know. Every soder day is so hard. 
Little bit of back story.
I know exactly how I got to this point too. I started work as a stripper 2 days after I turned 18, and it started as the occassional drink at uni parties or after work to fall asleep. I had always had issues with chronic pain, insomnia, ADHD, ASD, anxiety, and bi-polar 1. Alcohol helped for a time, but now its time to put it away as a crutch. I have an amazing medical team, support network, and family. The last thing I want is to destroy it. I am 34 now, and for the last 8 ish years my only length of time spent sober was during my now 5 yo sons prgnancy. i was also sober during my 12 yo daughters pregancy, but that was easy as i wasnt a drinker then. My now husband  and I met in uni when I was 18, and we have two  (challenging) wonderful children, and own our own home. I am a stay at home mom now and have been for pretty much 6 years. I briefly went back to dancing for about a year prior to covid, and I had at  least one glass of wine almost every night i worked, usually more, but rarely more than 3-4. I would stop at around 11-12 to make sure I was sober enough to drive home; I thought I was in control. I quit dancing due to my health and weight. Then covid hit and within months i was going through a box of wine and 6-10 beers a week, shit was getting exspensive. so I gave myself a $100 a month budget. so now im at 2 boxes of red, and two twelve packs of beer a month  with $15 left over. When I drink too much I wake up at like 4-5 am in a panic ""shit what did i do last night?"" and i usually dont even remember going to bed those nights. I am not violent, mean, or abusive when drunk, but when ive blacked out i tend to sleep walk. one morning my husband said i tried to go outside without pants on. Another morning he said that he had a nightmare that i drunkingly gave our T1D son insulin when he didnt need any. That moment right there was eye openeing to me, and how my drinking was affecting my loved ones. Thats when my nightmares started. Nightmares where I drunkingly hurt my kids. I know in my mind I would never hurt my kids, and aybe thats why theyre so scary, but now the fear is there. I need to do this for myself and my health, but I want to do this for them.

I'm 17 days sober. Physically quitting drinking largely comes easy to me. I'm 24 and have been drinking on and off since I was 18‚Äîintense, deep binges. I was enabled by an alcoholic ex but I also do blame drinking culture to an extent, and feel I have every right to. Of course, most of all I blame myself. It wasn't until I was 21 that I realized I could fall into my genetic predisposition for serious addiction if I wasn't careful, but I just didn't care.

I have unrelated, undiagnosed mental issues separate from alcohol. I don't like drinking. I would do it when I was bored or when I would start overthinking. I can drink *a ton*‚Äîa handle every 36 hours during the thick of things.

It's always been like a month or two on and three to four months dry. I'd binge, get annoyed at my days going by too quickly (the only noticeable consequence for a while), and quit. Again, I'd go from drinking like 5 handles per week to quitting cold turkey, no problem.

I recently fell into hard times...again...but not unlike anything I haven't dealt with before. Still, I drank to make the days shorter. 

Part of those hard times included breaking multiple bones in my foot. At the doctor, we discovered I have high blood pressure‚Äînotably high for my age.

I don't have the financial means to get this checked out, so I shrugged, knowing it was probably the alcohol, and quit again‚Äîcold turkey, no problem.

No cravings, no spiraling thoughts, no shakes, no nothing. I felt healthier again like I always do and I'm back on track again. This time, though, seeing the proof of it actually affecting my health has lit a greater fire under my ass, and I'm pretty determined to never drink again. It's always been such a vile f*cking habit. 

Problem is, this time I just have this. heavy heavy cloud over me. I'm not sure if you'd call it depression because, again, whatever cognitive cocktail of misprogrammings that plague my brain have never been diagnosed. I can't pull myself from it, though. I still have zero desire to drink (if I were to end my shit, why go the long and painful route?) but. I haven't been this active in looking for a way out of my own life since I was a teenager, when I could blame hormones.

I live by myself. I don't talk to anyone because I prefer it that way (when I'm not feeling like this). It goes beyond feeling aimless. It's utter pointlessness tinted with a generalized and unshakeable feeling of doom. The 'intrusive' thoughts I have feel less impulsive and more deliberate by the day. 

I guess I was just wondering if any of you feel that way, if it's a common product of newfound sobriety",16,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7247542}"

A little over two years ago, a new doctor where I'd moved switched my pain meds, and the new stuff was working well on pain at first so I didn't think much of it. It gradually stopped working and my mental health started to deteriorate. I didn't notice/worry too much that what had been relatively social drinking a few times a month was spiralling out of control to the point where I was drinking 3-4 bottles of wine, anywhere from a 2 to 5 days a week. In the last year, it's gotten so bad that I hardly leave my house and cycle between heavy drinking days and hangover days with intense anxiety. 

I moved again and vowed to stop the downward spiral. For a few months, I was doing pretty good. Walking around 5km a day, doing yoga, getting things done. I still was drinking 3-4 bottles a sitting but only a few times a month. Then I ran out of meds and saw a new pain doctor to get more. He basically said my previous doctors should never have had me on either of the past two medications and that I was just fat and needed to exercise more. It's not easy to find pain specialists where I live, so I didn't have a choice but to stop taking medication entirely. 

As pain levels increased, so did my drinking. Shitty way of coping, I know. I spiralled out of control over the 6 months. Stopped walking, stopped exercising, stopped leaving the house. Pretty much just drank, passed out, and repeat. My anxiety got so bad I could barely even convince myself to go to other rooms let alone outside. 

I finally reached out last week and saw a psychiatrist yesterday. He was horrified that the one doc took me off the original medication because it's so specific to the type of pain I have (spinal nerve pain), but even more so that it also works on depression and anxiety and the dopamine effect from drinking. I'm back on it plus a new medication for bipolar disorder and anxiety.

I haven't had a drink since Sunday and I'm finally feeling optimistic again. IWNDWYT

Too often before:
- Sleeping in because I was a ‚Äúnight owl‚Äù, often leaving my husband in charge of taking the kids to the bus
- Gagging when brushing teeth or taking a shower
- Needing to find a bathroom at the kids‚Äô school during a morning concert because I had diarrhea. Returning to seat. Needing to do it again (probably smelling like booze.)
- Being thankful that my work started after 10 as I was always so ‚Äútired‚Äù in the mornings (I had no idea I was chronically hungover even when I drank 2-3 glasses a night vs. the whole bottle or more.).
- Thinking I was perimenopausal at a young age as I would sweat every night 
- Thinking I had early onset dementia as I was forgetting things, having trouble with words and didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsharp‚Äù
- Planning my days around when I could have my next drink 
- Getting excited to go out not to see friends or experience moments but to DRINK with them
- Anxiety before finishing a drink and immediately looking for another
- Expending sooo much energy to plan to moderate; even if I was successful it wasn‚Äôt worth it
- Toilet issues!
- Eating healthily during the day, drinking at night and then seeking out carb and fat-laden foods to soak up the alcohol; gaining weight; feeling shitty about myself; drinking to stop feeling it
- Walking (stumbling) home by myself late at night after a night drinking with friends 
- Being grateful I live in a city so as to avoid drunk driving 
- Remembering only part of a night; waking up at 4 am with anxiety and crazily checking my social media to delete anything I posted while drunk. 
- Believing there were opportunities and dreams I couldn‚Äôt have because I drink too much 
- Being resigned to dying younger than I should because I drink too much 
- Believing that I NEEDED alcohol to feel alive
- Believing that I didn‚Äôt have a problem 
- Comparing my drinking to others to ‚Äúassess‚Äù if I have a problem; surrounding myself with others who also drink a lot to help with the comparison
- Embarrassing myself, my kids, my spouse by stupid things I‚Äôd say while drunk. 

Now:
- I wake up early and look forward to my cup of coffee and the quiet of the morning.
- I am awake to say goodbye to my daughter
- Brushing my teeth and showering are never accompanied by gagging
- If I smell, it‚Äôs not of alcohol!
- I eat a healthy, low-carb diet and lift weights. I‚Äôve lost 40lbs and am fit!
- My bowel movements don‚Äôt dictate whether I can leave the house because they are solid and predictable. 
- I am so smart!  I am intellectually curious!
- I even read books about brain chemistry because our brains are amazing and I spent years hurting mine with booze
- I don‚Äôt sweat in the middle of the night. 
- If I awaken at 4 am, it‚Äôs to pee and I am not anxious. 
- I feel rested and my skin looks amazing.
- I feel my feelings. I‚Äôve done a lot of therapy to help with this. It‚Äôs tough. Sometimes it‚Äôs so painful, but I ride the waves and I appreciate that I can. 
- My kids are proud of me. Read that again: my kids are proud of me!  That is such a gift. 
- I am much more patient and present and less reactive. 
- I approach others with a more open heart and less judgement. 
- I am filled with gratitude. 
- I feel free.

This all led up to the most embarrassing, shameful bender of all time where I refused to eat, spent way too much money, day drank, blacked out for two days and completely humiliated myself in front of my partner‚Äôs family. I didn‚Äôt think they liked me too much before then, but they sure as hell don‚Äôt like me very much now because of my actions that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable rewriting. 

Alcohol made me feel manic when I pretended to use it to numb my emotions. It‚Äôs put me in so many shame spirals that I thought couldn‚Äôt get any worse, but they always do. It left me bruised, injured, isolated so many times but I still denied that it was a significant problem when what I‚Äôve done and been through is simply not normal. So, I‚Äôm done. 

I‚Äôm 23 years old and I refuse to put myself through anymore emotional or physical pain because of alcohol.

of rum. I thoughtfully left 2 cans of the flavor he preferred, but I chugged them by myself when he went to the grocery store
the next day. (A good demonstration of how I cannot be trusted with alcohol, and of how 2 drinks is so unsatisfying).

Being an infuriatingly normal drinker, my partner doesn't seem to have noticed the now-empty box, and he likely won't think
to check it until Friday evening. Normally, I would go out and buy an identical box and surreptitiously refill the container
such that it looked like I drank a ""normal"" amount over the past few days (of course, any extras would be consumed on the
spot and the empty cans immediately hidden).

supply out as part of a ""30 day health challenge"". Anxious as hell about it, but whatever happens, IWNDWYT!

my question is - i'm just starting to realize this is an issue and want to change it. my therapist doesn't think i have an alcohol use problem per se and thinks i'm just too hard on myself. we've been working on being really aware of how many drinks i can have before i just say f it and have more than i should. i also struggle with emotional eating, overspending, overconsuming online, etc. so i definitely have addictive tendencies. has anyone in here had success with a sober coach (basically a ""life coach"" who does not have a formal education but has experience with quitting drinking) OR would y'all recommend staying with traditional therapy? i don't feel like going to inpatient treatment or AA are good fits for me but honestly i'm not sure where to go from here....

2021-09-09 06:30:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pkv6hk/learning_to_be_sober/,Learning to be sober.," Quitting drinking is a process of learning to control an addiction. There is no cure at this time so the objective is to learn how to manage the condition.

That is a difficult process because the addiction is often mixed with lots of other issues such as relationships and habits. It is also difficult because the addiction impairs the cognitive functions so thinking clearly is hard. Everyone has a different mix of these issues so a ""one size fits all"" remedy is not possible.

This is an attempt to simplify one small aspect, managing cravings. Cravings are the atomic level of the issue. It is the smallest common component.

The sharp, pointy end of the problem is the desire to have a drink. This can be the overwhelming compulsion as a reaction to a crisis or the soft siren of the five o'clock glass of wine. 

This desire stems from the subconscious mind, colloquially called ""the lizard brain"". It is a nebulous emotion like fear or anger. There are two initial challenges; the first is to recognise this emotion in one's self and the second is to give it a vocabulary. 

Once you have given it a name and can describe it you can then engage your conscious brain to analyse it and develop coping strategies. You move from a raw emotion to ""I am having a craving. Why is that? Ok, I am going to have ice-cream instead"". It's like having a split personality with two people talking inside your head, the subconscious and the conscious. The ability to stand outside of yourself and to objectively observe your thoughts is like developing a muscle group at the gym. It takes time and practice.

Analysing can involve recognising what time of day, situation or event that initiated the craving. An avoidance or coping strategies can then be developed. Avoidance could be to not go to a bar, mix with a particular social group or not keeping booze in house. Coping strategies could be going for a walk, eating something sugary or even giving yourself a good talking to.

As a result, I can write often have a week where I don't feel like I have connected with people much even if I have socialised (without alcohol, like at work or doing sports) because it feels like smalltalk, and I feel a bit lonely and bored as a result. And after a week of talking to people in the kitchen at work or playing tennis with someone and having smalltalk, I long for that feeling of connection.

If I see a photo of an alcohol drink on a table, it makes me think of laughing with people, meeting new people and enjoying it, meeting and sleeping with girls, feeling part of a group, binding with friends etc in a way that a can of coke or a smoothie doesn't. And similarly, seeing a bar or pub gives me those associations while a cafe or sports club doesnt.

I realise that this association must be because I have always relied on alcohol for socialising for about 16 years, and not really improved my social anxiety, social skills or ability to really connect with people much so I don't find socializing as rewarding without alcohol.

And I hope that by rewiring my brain, I can enjoy socialising enough to not feel an urge to drink when the weekend comes because I have connected with enough people during the week.

A vacation, an interview, my birthday, anniversary of a loved ones death, ANYTHING. So much so that when i was an active drunk, i got annihilated 2 days before my 23rd birthday alone. Bar hopped after work one day, drove myself to each bar, stumbled around my house at around 3am according to witnesses, knocked over some furniture, and then ‚Äúleft‚Äù again. I woke up the next day 15 minutes before work, still belligerent, in my car with it still running, in my neighbors driveway. I went straight to work hammered, and puked/cried for 45min at work, left to go to a meeting. The next day was my birthday, day 1 of sobriety. 


As my birthday, and sobriety date approach I am in a general panic. September 6th I was so anxious I did not sleep, not 1 minute. Around 4am i began full blown panic attacks in my room, until around 7. Went to work (after needing to be convinced) at 8. Worked (fucking hard) all day, came home and felt a little bit better, had a breakdown in bed at around 7:30pm, and finally passed out at 9pm. Woke up the 8th, feeling good, went to work feeling good, left work, came home, ate, went to school (night classes) felt great, afterwards felt great. Yet somehow it‚Äôs 4am again, I haven‚Äôt slept, and I‚Äôm panicking. I don‚Äôt know why. Once the date passes, It would probably subside for a little while, until the next subject of mine comes into thought. This is me just checking in and keeping myself accountable right now.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent**. Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is**: A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't**: A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

What's making you hopeful this Thursday? I just completed a job interview, and am encouraged by the fact that I showed up for it, no matter what happens. All the brightness and camaraderie here makes me hopeful, too. Something more positive to dwell on and dwell in than despair, which unfortunately seems far too readily available.

Which is not to say that negative moods are unwelcome or useless, of course. It's just that I find I have to consciously cultivate hope, harmony, pleasant signs for my poor starved heart to orient towards.

Feeling grateful is a skill we can develop. This is an opportunity for us to practice.**

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Hey all, it‚Äôs Thursday and almost the end of the working week for me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm grateful for that!

My main subject of thankfulness today is my earthly vessel. After so many years of abusing it in a number of different ways, my body has shown incredible resilience. I am very lucky.

Back before I quit drinking I was feeling physically unwell every day. Everything hurt and the smallest things were a challenge - feeling shit was my normal for many years.

These days I‚Äôm 3 years 3 months sober, I quit smoking cigarettes at the same time (wouldn‚Äôt recommend, switched to vaping that I eventually quit in July this year). I‚Äôve lost 43lbs (and still counting), I‚Äôm able to walk upstairs without almost passing out. I don‚Äôt have crazy IBS, grey skin, abdominal pain, constant nausea, or swollen feet. I am so grateful for my body‚Äôs ability to heal itself and get stronger. It would have had no chance during my active addiction. Plus, I just didn‚Äôt care.

I‚Äôm currently on week three of C25K and can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually the kind of person who runs at 9am on a Saturday morning! I actually DO stuff to actively look after my body, it‚Äôs wild after such a long time of doing the opposite. Walking places is joyful to me, now. When I look in a mirror I recognise myself and feel at peace. I see this as a sign of my self esteem rebuilding - that I finally feel like I‚Äôm worth the effort of taking care of myself - that I want to live. That‚Äôs amazing, to me.

That‚Äôs it from me. Happy Thankful Thursday. Hope you might share whatever you‚Äôre appreciating right now - big or small.  

Take care!

Luckily, every time I relapse, the actual relapse is shorter, I catch things quicker, I talk to people quicker, I admit my shit quicker.  But goddamn, it still sucks.

I had a ""moment of weakness"" or whatever you'd like to call it Saturday night, got drunk at a friend's house after they'd gone to sleep.  Felt like shit Sunday and had 7 drinks.  Monday felt awful but tried to be good and only had 3 to try to taper.  Back up to 10 Tuesday and 8 today/yesterday (Wednesday).  Never getting drunk, just that stupid maintenance drinking that helps you feel normal and have an appetite.

I want to be done tapering and off everything soon because right now I'm at the achy/stingy/can't sleep/super anxiety period.  Got myself eating after those first couple of days and drinking gatorade like its a my job but still feel awful.

I don't even know what the point of this is.  I just feel awful and feeling all the negative things.  I'm tired of relapsing.  A friend told me to make a video of how I look and feel so I did that this morning.  I have a sponsor, I regularly attend meetings.  I know I'm an alcoholic and so do all of my friends and family.  I guess just some kind words during these couple of days of awful anxiety and depression would be really helpful.

But after being alcohol free for 2 months I caved and had a week long bender. The previous bender a couple months ago caused me to fall down the stairs while I was home alone and cost me a $5000 trip to the ER to fix a dislocated shoulder. I must have been drinking all day every day for two months until that happened, and even continued to drink while recovering from my injury. I thought I was done with this, and I've thought that many times before. I am still trying to figure out why this happens and what causes me to drink. There have been so many red flags along this fucked up journey, and luckily nothing super terrible has happened (killing anyone or getting someone pregnant) but something needs to be done to permanently quit. I have been going to therapy, and my girlfriend has been nothing but wonderful even though my drinking has effected our relationship negatively multiple times. For her I am truly grateful.

  
Anyways, it's been about 6 hours since the last drink and this time I have to stop. I'm done. I can't continue on like this because it will eventually kill me, after destroying my life and relationships.

I didn‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd ever lock down another 90, let alone more, but when I was finally desperate enough to try, I recognized the only way to get over the fear would be to reassess how I was thinking about abstinence in general. No more moderation. No more timelines. No more bargaining.

Somehow, and I feel compelled to admit how lucky I am, this simply worked; I was able to make it through the next 90 days without too much trouble. 

I‚Äôm a hop/skip/jump away from doubling that, and I‚Äôve essentially done it with my eyes closed.

I could feel my vision being a little blurry, my mind feeling a little drifty, my balance being a little off... all just... the tiniest little bit, but enough for me to not feel 100%.

I also noticed how my moods seem a lot more... swingy-er than I recall my baseline being before I became addicted. I find that my current baseline has settled somewhere on the spectrum of depressed, and although nothing undesirable occurs I'm perpetually sad. This needs to change. 

I also dared to weigh myself, and found, unsurprisingly, that I am at the heaviest I've ever been. I think despite comfort foods being of help in temporarily spiking moods, I need to become more selective of what I consume.

Not entirely sure how this is all connected, but I discovered also that I feel somewhat luckier than many recovering alcoholics insofar as this is purely a desire for me to be rid of this damn substance. I, point blank, no longer want to be crippled by a bottle any longer and am merely living through experience of the gradual withdrawal. Alternative is simply... undesirable and therefore not at all a consideration. 

I feel like getting ""cravings"" to drink this time around is much easier to deal with than it ever has before on previous quitting attempts, because its BLATANTLY clear to me that I do not want to drink, so whatever is triggering the desire simply isn't me. 

It's no longer the case of ""oh I want to drink so bad, but oooh I'm not supposed to, oh the struggle"" it's more like ""oh I want to drink... wait! Who said that? NO I do not! Fuck off!""

I feel lucky for that.

I faintly remember being younger and excited to do things (anything really) and a lot of that has faded because it pales in comparison to drinking. 

As the title says, I started tracking my habits, basic things I‚Äôd like to do more of and thought it would be motivating to get to check them off each day. Things like clean the house, exercise, stretch, meditate, socialize, read, don‚Äôt order takeout. Honestly all things I do (or at one time did) enjoy and aren‚Äôt even that time consuming. 

For alcohol I‚Äôm tracking how many drinks I drink a day (0, 1-2, 3-5, 6+). Over the last 5 years I would say 5 of 7 days a week were 6+ nights. Frankly it is almost comical to have a 1-2 on there because that would never happen. If I wasn‚Äôt drinking at least 4 it‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm so horrifically hung over that I slept through the day. I‚Äôve been trying to cut back so there‚Äôs been slight variability there the last two weeks. 

It is really unsettling to see that the days where I colored in 6+ drinks, I did not color in ANYTHING else. The entire day devoted to drinking. No meditation, no outside time, no cleaning the house, no writing, in most cases no socializing‚Ä¶ nothing. 

Years. Of. Nothing. 

I am aware of the sunk cost fallacy and so I won‚Äôt dwell on those days gone but damn. No wonder I‚Äôve been depressed. I traded a chunk of my youth for TV shows I can‚Äôt remember and food that makes me sick.

 I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll slip again, I just hope to have WAY less nothing days in this decade of my life. Today was a zero drink day and I did 9/10 other activities on my list. It‚Äôs so cool and I was so busy all night I hardly had time to think about a drink. Hopefully I can remember this feeling (it‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm memorializing it here). 

Anyway if you made it this far, thank you for taking the time out of your day. I appreciate it.

I‚Äôve attempted to quit and have done for months at a time over the last decade or so but this time, after reading ‚ÄúThis Naked Mind‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlcohol Explained‚Äù, my brain has been reformatted. Unlike the last times giving up, where I attempted it to ‚Äú*see how long I could go for*‚Äù or was just taking a break. Now, after reading/studying those books, the thought of alcohol *truly* repulses me. 

That brings us to today. Today I am two weeks sober. And today, I have been sent away to work doing videography in a **pub**. For 2 days day and night. Where the people I‚Äôm filming are drinking, patrons are drinking and I‚Äôm being offered booze left right and center. To turn it up a notch, this work trip is fully paid for. AKA, *free bar* and early finishes from filming. 

I‚Äôve been dreading this trip because in the past when I‚Äôve tried to quit, occasions like this are what have made me crumble. 

But. Not. Today. 

Not f*cking today, my friends. 

For the first time since I was 14 (33 now), I wasn‚Äôt tempted. I wasn‚Äôt laser focussed on thee thought of ‚Äújust having a pint‚Äù. I was free. Totally free. The alcoholic section of my brain has been cut out, boxed up and sent away on a one way ticket to Whogivesashitsville. 

What an incredible and empowering experience. Speaking to my wife, I tried to explain it as akin to being in a place that served only Mayonnaise, a food which makes me want to wretch. Explaining that not only was I not tempted by alcohol but I genuinely couldn‚Äôt care less about it. 

For me, giving up alcohol has always been 50% of the battle and the other half has been the social/cultural element of living in the UK where drinking is the most normal thing for people to do. 

And it‚Äôs always been the social peer pressure that‚Äôs been the biggest deciding factor for making me fall of the wagon. After reading those incredible book, I finally understand not just that alcohol is a poison but the in depth profound affects of what ingesting that poison does. With that knowledge in mind, wielded as as weapon, it was effortless to thwart off any and all potential triggers to drink or accept drinks. 

Conquering the cultural stigmatism of being the sober guy in the pub was the missing piece of the puzzle for me and today, I found it. Finally. 

I dreaded this day. And now, I realise it has been the greatest and most pivotal day of my life. For myself, my family and my future. 

Now to go to sleep, wake up fresh, with a clear conscience, fully recharged ready for another productive day!

I've made it this far before, so it's still kind of underwhelming for me right now. (That said, it's important not to downplay the achievement to the extent that it might lead to a slip into complacency, which I've also done before.) I'm in the middle of sorting out the mess within my head and determining how much of it is due to mental illness (diagnosed in early childhood, so there's no confusion there) versus some of the fairly common PAWS symptoms I've researched. It's likely a little bit of both. I've had my anxiety and panic disorders locked down for several years (for the most part), but both as well as the associated depression have resurfaced somewhat heavily over the past 2 weeks. Honestly, it could have been happening long prior to that, but was easily ignored during my active drinking. Anywho, I'm in the process of finding a new mental health expert so I can add some new tools (and possibly medication) to my belt. Life is not sunshine and rainbows for me, and my sobriety isn't all that glamorous right now, but it's impossible to beat the feelings of consistency and resolve I get to experience. Being hangover-free in the mornings and making more productive use of my downtime is certainly a major highlight.

Am I an alcoholic? Is it a ""disease"". I don't fucking know.
Do I drink better than millions, sure.
Do I drink worse than millions, sure.
I can choose to paint my drinking anyway I want; either as ""not a problem"" or ""as a problem"" depending on what lense I pick.
But in the end, I can't deny the spiritual blows alcohol has given me. The self respect alcohol has taken. The money alcohol has squandered. The health alcohol has crippled. The hours upon hours of conscious active living alcohol has stolen. So, maybe I'll never die from it, maybe I'll never become completely broken in a specific realm of my life if I keep drinking. But what I do know, is this shit is just not a positive thing to do, and it definitely isn't helping me grow or be my best self....and you can't help but to wonder why someone would keep coming back to something so expensive in tax on so many different areas of the only life to be had, if there wasn't something deep down wicked about the whole thing.

Not so sure about aa either. I‚Äôve read the books (naked mind etc).

The longest time I‚Äôve gone without a drink in around seven years. The below is the story of the night that made me quit (it‚Äôs a lil long, apologies in advance!)

*Why would anyone not drink?*

This was the thought going through my head, as my eyes drifted to the side of the canvas tent at my friend E‚Äôs wedding reception. I took another mouthful of crisp white organic wine, relaxing into the feeling of muzzy-headedness that my two - or was it three? four? glasses of wine had already given me. I laughed slightly too loud at my friend C‚Äôs joke, causing M, another friend, to chuckle at me from the other side of the table and tell her work colleagues sitting beside her about my impressive drinking fortitude at the hen do a month prior. She mentioned something from that night that I didn‚Äôt remember, and I chuckled along a bit nervously, concerned now that I had apparently said that then, and my brain had no record of it. I took another drink to calm myself, then another. And another‚Ä¶ 

I don‚Äôt remember much about the speeches. I was applauding one minute, and then my glass was a shattered mess on the floor. How had it got there? I was just now holding it‚Ä¶ Shamefaced, I tried to pick it up, but was pulled away by friends. ‚ÄúYou should really sit down, S.‚Äù I could hear the concern in their voices. I was still wanting to help, so I tried to move, and toppled off the chair into another broken glass - or maybe it was my one, I don‚Äôt know. Then I was bleeding; I remember a concerned man mopping the blood from my leg, the leg in which I think I still have glass embedded even now. 

Apparently there was dancing after the speeches, but I don‚Äôt remember it. I don‚Äôt remember my friends A and B deciding that they‚Äôd take me back to the Airbnb; I don‚Äôt remember leaving the venue. I only recall that suddenly I was in A‚Äôs car; then I was throwing up all over her door and footwell, and we stopped and sat on the grass by the road till I had got it all out. I sat in the car for a moment while they ran to the garage to get water to rinse off the door, as I tried futilely to get a chunk of vomit off the seal of the rolled-down window. 

I was apologising over and over and they kept being lovely and reassuring but I wanted to die of humiliation. I hated that my poor choices had meant a derailment of their evening, and I hated feeling like a liability. I had broken the shoes my mum had lent me, got vomit and dirt all down the dress which was also hers; I had vomit in my bra. I felt sad, sticky, smelly and embarrassed. 

Eventually we got back to the Airbnb and somehow I must have managed to give the key which was in my purse to B. I took a shower fully clothed, leaving the wet clothes on the floor next to my backpack, grabbed a shirt and knickers and fell asleep. When I woke up at around 5am for the loo, I looked down at myself with some confusion. *I don‚Äôt own a shirt this colour*‚Ä¶ I then realised it was B‚Äôs shirt, which I must have picked up off the floor. 

While my friends were sleeping, I lay there with a head that felt like boiled haddock until my stomach forced my back to the bathroom. I‚Äôd drunk a glass of water but my stomach wasn‚Äôt having it. I retched water until there was nothing in my stomach and forced myself to lie down till the others woke up. 

The hangover was the worst I‚Äôd ever experienced (dehydration from vomiting for sure) and I couldn‚Äôt eat until much later that day. In fact, I couldn‚Äôt eat properly all week. My stomach was swollen and tender, as was my pancreas, and it felt like something was seriously not right. My symptoms matched up with alcoholic gastritis and I wondered if I was bleeding internally. All the same, I pushed myself that week, going back to the gym, driving to a different city to see a friend, and hiking with my family. The following weekend I collapsed, exhausted, too tired even to sleep. 

40 days in. I can‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs been relatively OK physically, just some gnarly fatigue that I‚Äôd experienced before (in the spring of this year when I quit downing a few bottles of spirits a week). I don‚Äôt crave alcohol physically; the thought still makes my stomach sick but I‚Äôm a bit afraid of what might happen when I am no longer physically repulsed by it. 

It‚Äôs been much tougher mentally and emotionally. I burst into tears most days over little things and I run out of emotional energy quicker. I‚Äôm more aware of people drinking on TV, have had to disable alcohol ads on Google so I didn‚Äôt see them on YouTube, and unfollowed some Instagram accounts. I‚Äôm more affected by casual chat about alcohol at work, and will start thinking about it more if people mention it a lot. I‚Äôll get random cravings too; I‚Äôll be walking from the car to the house, or see someone inspecting wine bottles in the supermarket, and think: *I could buy one. I could. But I won‚Äôt. For today.*

She is in end-stage liver failure after years of being in poor health and alcoholic depression. She was an absolute ray of golden light when I was a kid and has so many wonderful qualities but alcohol has taken those wonderful qualities from her over the last 10-15 years and replaced them with a mother I often didn't recognize and struggled to connect with. I am 29 and recently sober myself (2 months tomorrow!) and attempting to live my life in ways she couldn't but it has been really tough and I've had a rough couple days. My immediate family all still drink. I've been seeing a lot of them lately while my mom's been hospitalized, which is nice but also just highlights the fact that one of the reasons I think I have a problematic relationship with alcohol is that I used it as a way to feel like I fit in, especially with my family. Sobriety overall feels good and I absolutely know it is the right choice for me, but being the only sober person in my family has me feeling incredibly lonely these days. My family is drinking, a lot of my friends are drinking, my coworkers are hitting a bar after work, and I am sipping my la croix with my dying mother's image and an excess of anxiety swimming in my brain. It makes me feel like on top of repelling people for being sad (it turns out people REALLY don't want to hear that I have a dying mother), I am also repelling people for being sober. And ""sad but sober"" is probably the best way to describe me right now. I know the social anxiety with my friends and coworkers will get easier the longer I'm sober, but I have always been a bit of an outcast in my family and this just makes it feel even more pronounced. I don't see a way to bring this up to them without ostracizing myself further during a time when I am desperate for all the love I can get. I hate that my brain's default solution to feeling lonely is to drink, because it has honestly never helped me fit in or solved any of my issues with my family, it just made me not care.

I miss my mom, I have a complicated relationship with the rest of my family, I'm single and living away from a lot of my friends, I have my own drinking to contend with, I can tell I'm doing poorly at my job because I'm so distracted, and like 3 million other problems seemed to come up this week and it all just feels so overwhelming.

I work in a different state and am sitting here trying to pack for a trip home knowing I won't be able to see my mom, can't do anything to fix her situation, and it feels like I won't be able to connect with my family or solve anything while I'm there. I crave a sense of home that simply doesn't exist as it once did. I love my family but I'm having to reckon with realities i've been carefully dodging for years and it just feels really hard. I just want to melt into the earth while these troubling things work themselves out overhead. I'm so tired of feeling alone and overwhelmed, I know this rough patch will pass but I could just use some positive encouragement or advice or stories from people who might know what I feel like. I'm sorry if this post has been rambly and incoherent, I have been feeling pretty rambly and incoherent lately so know that it is, at least, on theme.",17,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4036881}"

Still sober.","Just kind of writing this to get my thoughts out.  Oh, and I am nearing 1k days, which is wild. 

My wife and I got fucked over.  We started looking at houses in late June, in prep for our lease ending in September.  We made sure we had PLENTY of time.  We went under contract on a first house in early July, but that house fell through at appraisal, but at least that was early into the process.  This second house we ended up going under contract in late July, with an initial closing date that would have given us 2-3 weeks of wiggle room.  We did this on purpose to prevent any issues.  It gets close to closing, and there are issues that cause them to change the date.  From my understanding this was a fairly normal extension, no one's fault really.  Then, about two days before reaching the closing date, the seller ""discovers"" that they haven't paid a certain utility in well over a year, and has to mail some documents to the city.  Fucking annoying, but fine we can still close with a few days to spare.  At this point, we are already very stressed due to the uncertainty of the situation.  It's stressful to not know where you will be sleeping in the coming weeks/days.  

Today we were set to close.  Everything was setup perfectly, we've wired our funds and had begun packing the moving truck.  While packing this morning, I get a call from our agent that there is a problem.  The seller cannot afford what they owe the bank on the house after closing.  I can see the records, this dude bought it two years ago for almost 150k less than we are paying - but he somehow cannot afford what he owes on it after we pay???  I understand shit happens, but there is no way the sellers couldn't have seen this coming.  Instead, for whatever reason they waited until the literal last second and completely fucked us.  The contract falls through while we have less than 24 hours remaining on our lease with our apartments.  

My wife and I are kind of taking it in stride, though I can tell she is very stressed. We know we will figure something out, and we're thinking that this way we will end up in a house that we like more than this last one.  But still holy shit this sucks.  We've been kind of laughing about it... not sure if we're laughing to cope or if it's just at the sheer absurdity of it. We are in our apartment still tonight, but no clue where we will be sleeping tomorrow... probably an AirBnB while we find an apartment that will give us a short term lease, we've already contacted two that can get us in fast, but now we're wasting extra money due to the lease terms.  We will be paying hundreds more in rent than we would have on our mortgage.  

I've been doing a lot of mindfullness shit lately, which is helping me immensely right now.  No desire to drink, but I figure it's best to be as careful as possible.  So it goes, I guess :P",15,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7703463}"

A few days later he talked to me about it and said I should quit because it could hurt me in the end. And addiction runs in his family and he's seen what it can do... Ultimately in my head I took it as I need to choose him or alcohol...so I chose him...it's been hard. And there's days after work where all I want is to drink... But he reminds me all the time why I wanted to quit. I had always wanted to but never had someone care enough to help me actually quit... 7 months-ish later the battle is not nearly as hard as it used to be. We celebrate each time I get another month sober. 
I'm now quitting my job and going to school to become a CNA. And hopefully work in the local hospital shortly after. My boyfriend also proposed over the weekend!

I was actually hesitant to change my badge and share because I didn't want others thinking they could have the same experience and get hurt, but after a talk with my amazing friend u/chiefinlove she reminded me that this is my recovery story, not anyone else's. I'm responsible for my recovery alone and I need to own it and be honest with you and with myself. 

Please just remember while reading this that everyone's recovery is different and this is not advice or any kind of guide.


~ ~ 

It wasn't for any particular reason. Just a string of basic bad days and particularly bad cravings, as I have had many times before. 

Playing the tape forward wasn't working, but this time I wasn't lying to myself saying I could only drink once or that I could moderate. I knew I couldn't promise myself that, and I knew the night could go very badly, but I also knew that if I relapsed that night I would still have support and the courage to get back up and keep going. 

So I convinced myself that giving in that night would just solidify that drinking is not for me anymore. That it would give me a chance to look at the act with my new knowledge and perspective and see how much I've changed, and how drinking no longer fit in with my new life, who I am now, or who I want to be. 

More lies from the alcohol? Probably.

I wasn't lying to myself and saying it would make my problems go away. I wasn't telling myself that I wanted to relax or forget. I have no idea what I was looking for, and I still couldn't tell you why I did it.

Part of me thought that if it went badly then I would be reminding myself how awful it was and then I wouldn't have cravings as bad going forward. 

More lies from the alcohol? Probably.

It was a stupid risk to take, but it consumed me and I took it anyway. 

So what happened? Nothing significant at all. I bought a hip flask to limit the amount available to me and split it with my husband. I caught a buzz but didn't get trashed. I didn't black out. I didn't have a hangover the next day. It was very anti-climactic. And you know what? It was boring. It didn't make my night worse, but it literally did nothing to make my night any better.

Which means all of that pain and destruction, all of that depression and anxiety, a decade of ruining myself and my life. For what? For that? Not worth it. At all.

I learned a lot about myself that night. My way of thinking has changed entirely. I stayed calm. I could separate the ""me"" thoughts from the little nagging bad ones, even while I was drinking. I could see how much more sneaky and manipulative they got the more I drank. Being able to talk out what was happening in my head with my husband helped a lot and I experienced alcohol for what it really is, an evil little demon that tries to possess your mind, body, and emotions. I observed that little bastard in it's natural habitat and I didn't want it to be any part of me, and I banished it.

There is no longer any reason to drink. There never was. And there never will be again.

So I went to sleep, I woke up, and I went on with my life. I was kind to myself about it, which is still the biggest change I'm still blown away I was able to make, but this is who I am now. And it will only get better from here without that demon in the back of my head.

I'm still 151 days into recovery, but I stand here before you on my new day 4, sober, and ready to say I will not drink with you today, or ever again.

Tonight I am going to start a blog journal and I am going to write in it as often as possible to keep my thoughts clear and organized. The goal is to never feel lost like that again.

I was 23 years old and full of hatred, pain, sadness and loneliness. I was failing out of school because I was drunk and high from the second I woke up to the second I passed out. I was losing what friends I had, and my relationship with parents was strained. My best days were a 2 or 3 out of 10. I was abusing alcohol, marijuana, adderall and vyvanse every day.

On Spring break, I went home and broke down in front of my parents. I told them I needed help, because I knew that I wouldn't survive another year going the way I was. If I didn't overdose, I would probably kill myself. As much as it hurt, I finally admitted that I couldn't control my drinking and drugging. I told them I needed to go to rehab. 

Much to their credit, they were not judgemental or angry. Seeing me in so much pain hurt them. They later confided in me that hearing me say these things made them feel as if they had failed me. They knew I'd been struggling and had their suspicions that I was in a bad place. But they were fully supportive of me checking myself into treatment. Over the next week, they helped me get my affairs together. I withdrew from my schooling with the blessing of the Dean after I explained what was happening. 

And on March 18, 2016, my dad dropped me off at a treatment facility. Over the next year and a half, I went from rehab to a halfway house. I believe that these structured facilities truly helped set me up for success. AA and a number of support systems helped me remain sober and deal with some of the issues that caused me to drink in the first place.

Since that day, the lowest point in my young life, I have been sober for 2000 days and I have *thrived*. I'm now in a well paying, respectable job. I'm (hopefully) going to be getting a promotion in terms of responsibility and compensation next week. I talk to my parents every week. I'll probably call my dad this evening. I own a home and live with an amazing woman who I want to marry. I am physically active. I have an amazing group of friends who are supportive of my sobriety. Even though they drink, they've expressed the will before that they would slap a drink out of my hand if they saw me going for one. 

My life is so rich and vibrant today. I can't believe that I was throwing away what would become such a full and fun life. My worst days now are a 6 or a 7. I am grateful to everyone who has helped me along the way. To my sponsor in AA, to my parents who stuck by me even when I was at my lowest, and to the various counselors that have helped me understand myself. 

But I understand that all of these amazing things that I am now blessed with are all contingent on my sobriety. If I relapse, it can all come crashing down, just like it did 5 years ago. Sometimes people ask me if I ever want to drink again and my response is always ""Why? There is so little upside with so much potential downside that I see absolutely no reason to even consider it.""

If you want to stop drinking, even though it sometimes feels impossible, I can assure you that you can do it. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, even if you can't see it just yet.  I hope that some day, you can return to a life in the sun.

Over the next several months, until COVID hit, I hosted parties for friends and strangers to come enjoy the tiki bar. Many of the visitors to my bar knew when to stop, I did not. I love tiki - the aesthetic is very near and dear to my heart. The art, the music, the vibes in general, it helps me relax and forget my worries. Admittedly, alcohol was also a big part of my appreciation. 

When COVID hit I still had some stock in the bar, I'd go off to make a drink during work from home hours, I'd hang out in the bar after a fight with my girlfriend (now fianc√©e), and we'd end up in the bar when we made up. Holidays, special occasions, Friday nights, Monday mornings. It was my refuge during the first six months of lockdown.

This year, I packed up the bar and moved to a house with no shed. All that tiki gear is in boxes in the garage now. But I didn't stop drinking. I denied that I have a problem. I started many more fights, I said things that I regret, did things that embarrass me, and I made life hell for my fianc√©e and for myself. 

I accepted without question that alcohol was part of my existence. High school, working the trades, college, and beyond. Every event, every non-event, major life decisions - all accompanied by a stiff drink, and then n+1 more. 

A couple weeks ago I finally realized how bad it was. I saw the pain that I causes and it tore me up. That night, I posted here - sad and drunk - understandably it was taken down (I wasn't in the mood to read rules). But for the brief period it was up, I was sent a few really nice messages. Thank you for the kind words. I believe the messages that came though that night saved my life. 

Over the last couple weeks I've slowly regained some clarity. I see how alcohol affects me, and how my use of it impacts those around me. I'm strong in my resolve to stop drinking. However, I've also had the opportunity to hang out with people who are drinking while I am sober. I still need to work on being less anxious in crowds but I do not want to stop others from enjoying themselves. Quite the opposite, I love that people can have a few drinks and have a good time.

Given the opportunity, I'd take down the boxes in the garage, set up the tiki bar, and host again. However, I'd leave the booze out of anything that I make for myself. I like that people can enjoy one or two drinks and stop. I still feel that it's a nice escape, it's an opportunity to feel important, classy, silly, fun, or to otherwise enjoy our existence. 

My fianc√©e loves it when I make drinks for her at home, I rim the glass with sprinkles and come up with something based on what we have on hand. The drinks taste great (she tells me) and they look pretty. I love that it makes her happy. She calls them ""fancy drinks"" and she loves taking pictures of them and drinking them. Sometimes I'll make one for myself and leave the alcohol out, it's fun.

I believe that for her, it's not a poison, it doesn't infect her mind like it does to me. She can enjoy one or two drinks and stop. She can make a bottle of booze last a month or longer. I used to make them disappear in an evening. 

I am happy that people are able to moderate while they enjoy their limited time on this planet. I love being around those people and laughing with them.

What's even better is that I had a GREAT time at both. 

When I started this journey 8 months ago the thought of going through my wedding day sober was unimaginable to me. It's sad to think about but I felt like I absolutely needed alcohol to have fun and be sociable. And there were many times I thought about making an exception for my wedding day. But when the day arrived I wasn't even thinking about alcohol, I was just happy.

This isn't the end of my journey. I know better than to underestimate that voice in my head that will continue to pop up from time to time, telling me I've proven I can control alcohol and can handle a few drinks now and then. The depression and social anxiety that led me to alcohol are still with me, though now that I'm facing them head on I've begun making progress. But after this weekend I feel so much hope.

I loved craft beer and cocktails. Who doesn't like to have fun, right? Even when the hangovers started getting in the way a little at work, I could just cut back and be fine for a while. Until I wasn't. It became a cycle of saying I'd cut back, breaking the promise to myself, waking up ashamed and embarrassed and determined to do better, and breaking the promise to myself a couple of weeks later.

I finally quit because I woke up to a letter from my drunk self saying that I knew I had a problem, but I could only do something about it sober. For all her flaws, drunk-me had a good point. Good enough that I finally quit.

I missed the milestone yesterday. 7 years. 7 years! When I first quit, it was all-consuming. Now? I think about it sometimes, but I rarely put myself in situations where I have to. When I do, I have tools and support. People in my life who I can text and say ""I'm not going to drink today, and I just needed to make that commitment to someone other than myself"". A partner who rarely drinks. An app with the Big Book on my phone, because even though I am not a meetings sort of girl, sometimes having that tool helps.

In my experience, quitting gets easier the longer you stick with it. It varies for everyone, I know. And I was fortunate. I had what's sometimes described as a ""high bottom"", I didn't lose my job or damage any relationships beyond repair. I've done well without AA, choosing to work the Women for Sobriety program when I need structure. There's no one correct way to do this. But the essential thing is not drinking *today*.

I became a full alcoholic age 13 due to growing up in a alcoholic home. My parents thought me being drunk was cool and funny so I started age 7 and went on from there. 

Over the decades it got slowly worse. There were the odd short lived improvement, never sober, but sometimes a bit less, only for it to go back to worse than ever. For most of the time though I was functional. 

Eventually, though I became none functional. I couldn't do anything but drink. I suffered DT's every morning. Massive shaking, hallucinations, even incontinence. I would literally just lay watching TV drinking a couple of bottles of vodka a day. A lot more of o actually wanted to get drunk. 

Last August I had enough. I was aged 50 and I knew I couldn't care this existence any more. It was stop it kill myself as just existing was hell.

So, I spoke to my doctor. That led to me being referred to the local addiction team who assessed me and arranged a medical supervised detox. Luckily I was able to do that at home with the medical people coming to my home each day. During that, I started longer term medication to help keep me sober. Campral which removes alcoholic cravings and antabuse which prevents me drinking. I also started counselling which has been amazing. 

Since then, I have managed to go back to work in a new job and even had two promotions, despite them knowing my background. I have got married to the most amazing woman in the world and started training to be a volunteer addiction counsellor. My life is not recognisable from a year ago.

I am overweight, unhealthy, and having horrible anxiety. My father was a heavy drinker all of his adult life until he quit cold turkey about 12 years ago and has never had a drink since. My mother started drinking more around the time I was a teenager and continued to drink heavily until she was to ill to do so. I am 54 years old and I have abused alcohol on and off (mostly on) since I was a teenager. I suddenly lost my husband to heart disease 9 years ago. He was only 50. For the last three years I have been caring for my Mother who passed in November of 2020 from cancer, heart disease, and kidney failure. My drinking, which was already out of control, escalated after my Mother passed. At that point I had been drinking daily for years and would drink about a pint of vodka a day, sometimes more. I started smoking cigarettes at times when I was drinking a lot which only made me feel more ashamed and unhealthy. I live with my father now. I cook and clean for him and help him with his medications and stuff. He was with my Mom since they were teenagers. They were married 60 years. He is grieving hard and is lonely and depressed. I have a wonderful loving boyfriend who I have been with for seven years. My drinking is impacting our relationship because I am often drunk or sick. I have always suffered from anxiety issues and I started waking up at night with panic attacks and having difficulty sleeping. I have detoxed myself three times recently but the longest I stayed sober was 10 days. I have been drinking heavily the last two weeks. My last drink was about 12 hours ago. I want badly to get healthy and I am praying that I can get through detoxing myself again and stay sober. I am very fearful of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Since I have to be with my father and I have issues right now with money and health insurance I have no choice but to try and get healthy without treatment. My boyfriend wants to go Up North this weekend but I am afraid I won‚Äôt be feeling well. It is sad, scary and depressing.

Somehow, others drinking or being drunk around me has never greatly impacted or triggered me at all - mostly I suspect because my problem drinking happens only when I'm alone. I never much enjoyed drinking around others, because I felt compelled to slow down my consumption to match theirs, which was unsatisfying. On the whole, I have had very few experiences around other drunk people, and I can find others being drunk quite endearing. 

Well he comes home a bit silly and blundering and slurry, recounting the weirdly themed pub he visited with his co-workers after they finished their activities. I undress him and put him in pyjamas to get ready for bed, I make him a Dioralyte (basically a rehydration/anti-hangover drink) and get him to finish it. He mumbles a few times that he doesn't feel good. I give him a lil cuddle and promise that he will feel better in the morning.

Well, what the fuck, he does. He wakes up perfectly normally, makes some porridge, and thanks me for taking such good care of him yesterday. He wasn't blackout yesterday, and he didn't wake up at 3am with a burst of crippling anxiety. He's *NOT* throwing up, or unable to focus, or extremely depressed. He's at work for 9am as usual. We have great sex during our lunch break. He's booked a restaurant for us to go on a date this evening.

It always really *gets* me when I see normal people drink. Like, how do they do that? How is he not an absolute zombie right now? Because holy shit, I probably would be. 

I think this is the sneaky thing about alcohol when you are an alcoholic - seeing others use it normally. And omg, it's fucking everywhere. It's not just my boyfriend and friends and family. In the show we're watching, the main character is rarely on screen without drinking a glass of wine. Advertisements for beer and whiskey are everywhere. ""Adult celebration"" is now basically synonymous with the phrase ""get drunk in a socially acceptable fashion"", as though celebrating sober is a childish pursuit.

The truth is, I'm not my boyfriend, and I can't do what he does without eventually slipping down the slope of blackouts, 3am crippling anxiety and vomitting. I can see what I'm missing out on, clear as day. It isn't worth it. My entire life is more important than my addiction.

I went to a fantasy draft so I brought a case for the group. I owed the host a few beers anyway. I didn't drink any of the case, and I left it there when I went home. But I could tell my brain was already in rationalization mode. Everyone else was drinking, it was just one, it would be weird for me to bring a case of beer and not drink any of it. The most insidious was when I gave myself credit for not drinking there, which I had not fully accomplished yet, and using that as a potential justification to drink.

Bottom line, I can feel the weekly mental cycle begin. Drink too much on the weekend, feel guilty and anxious Monday, begin to feel more comfortable as the week goes on, drink too much on the weekend. My brain is already dismissing how I felt yesterday and is trying to downplay all of this. Hopefully these entries continue to help me stay focused and not push my concerns to the back of my mind as usual.

The good news is even an arbitrary 30 days is helping me keep perspective. 30 days without drinking  shouldn't be a problem. And if it's not a problem why not just do it to prove it isn't. I am already seeing upsides as well. I was a little spacy when I came home because of the long day, and I would normally feel guilty if it was because I'd been drinking. I'd at least have to spend mental energy trying to act ""normal."" But I just told my girlfriend I'd had a whole Lacroix while I was out, which she seemed to think was funny.

Been lurking for a bit and have enjoyed reading your stories. I'm proud of each and everyone of you from the long term sober, to the short term sober, and the sober curious. So how did I get here. Never was a big drinker in college. Maybe 4-5 drinks per month. I began my professional career at a law enforcement agency that specialized in digital forensics of child exploitation. I was there for about five and half years. At this job I was tasked with examining digital devices for child exploitation materials and testify to my finds. Towards the end of my time at this job they added the responsibility of assisting the crime scene techs with some new specialized equipment. So during my time at this agency I saw the worst sides of humanity, because of this I started drinking at night to block out the memories and just try to quiet my mind. Like some(maybe many) the drinks slowly grew in number at night. I became a moderate drinker after this and once the pandemic hit became a heavy drinker. I'm on day 2 of trying to quit. The longest I have done in the past 10 years was probably 30 days. I'm hoping this will be the last day 2. Thanks for reading. IWNDWYT",12,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49355528}"

I started thinking about quitting, moderating, etc this time last year. I‚Äôm on my 3rd 6 day streak and it feels different that the previous 2. 

This time I‚Äôm not struggling with my decision. The physical, mental, and ‚Äúall in your head‚Äù withdrawals still suck, but it hasn‚Äôt got me rethinking or rationalizing my next drink.

I started this journey with way less optimism and excitement. I‚Äôve been really even keel about my expectations. 

I‚Äôm not waking up each morning bursting with pride for ‚Äúmaking it another day‚Äù

It‚Äôs as if trying to quit in the past stole the motivation that comes with novelty but maybe it‚Äôs been replaced by something better.

Before, I needed to hope that sober life promised a constant and profound sense of well-being. I didn‚Äôt arrive with those expectations this time. Instead, the past 5 days have offered these tiny miniscule moments like that. The moments are so subtle but so worth it. 

I think as humans, especially in a western culture, we are very good at finding reasons to feel ashamed or guilty. As everyone in the wellness community is now aware, shame does nothing to help us quit addictive behavior. But the other nice thing about not drinking, is that those inclinations to shame myself and those horrible 3 am thoughts do not try to intrude anymore, at least not on the drinking front. It makes the journey of ‚Äúspiritual reparenting‚Äù a lot easier because the tidal wave of self loathing is a lot smaller. This is pretty cool.

So I also don‚Äôt have running list of reminders on why I want to stop drinking. I kind of just know that I do, and I trust that. There are a few phrases that have helped me to get here though

1) not being hungover is better than being drunk 

2) you never regret not drinking

3) the glass of wine is delicious and satisfying because you were withdrawing EVERYDAY 

4) alcohol puts you back to a baseline that you would be at anyway without the wine

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning

I buy alcohol every day and if it's the house we will both drink but, the difference is I can function in the morning she can't. She hasn't been working for awhile because she feels so sick every day.

Today I told her I've finally come to terms and realized I'm the problem but I'm scared the only way to make her better is to at least take a break.

However, with covid emerged the need for technological solutions for groups support.  I will not lie and It takes me many attempts in the last few months but with the support of you guys and by connecting to my home country AA zoom meeting every day, in my language, I am finally on day 7.

I've taken real steps for the first time ever.,"I posted yesterday about getting so effed up, and my boyfriend being so mad he said he wanted to break up. He was so angry he wouldn't look at me, would barely engage (we had a day of travelling---12 hours!) , wouldn't let me touch him. Slept apart at home. 

Today things were better after he cooled off. We talked, he was still angry but it appears we are not going to break up. But it's clear that there will be no more chances.

Ironically, I had broached the topic of complete abstinence last week, but of course, this weekend we would be on vacation, so wink wink, ammiright? And he let me, because I've been so ""good"" with the moderation lately. Then I get ridiculously, embarrassingly, stupidly blackout drunk. In front of a lot of fam. Fell over at least once. Didnt care about my boyfriend, the love of my life,, and what he wanted for our evening. Goddammit. 

Anyway, today I contacted 2 places. One is a place for intensive outpatient. The other is a clinical ketamine place (I've researched this a lot). 

I am not going to be that person anymore, the one who doesn't give a flying rat's ass about anybody else when she's drinking. They say in vino Veritas, but you know what? NO. I am not that girl. I DO care. 

Done with moderating. It is too damn hard and has no rewards. Time to commit to a worthy goal. Hope to be checking back in here with you fine folks in the days to come.

nothing positive happy to share here ... just looking to ramble and talk it out a little bit since i dont have access to therapy right now. 

Not my first relapse, hope it will be my last, because this time alcohol just turned me into a demon. A demon so vile and poisonous that even 4 days later i still cant live with my own toughts nor sleep with myself. Nightmares. A lot of them.

After a wonderful 2 month sober on my own, the love of my life had a little slip up at a family gathering and i ended up spending my entire night holding her hair while she puke and all that good jazz. I wasnt mad at all, i could even see myself in her wich made me just want to support her more. Fast forward a week later and i simply cant get the idea out of my mind that i derserve a drink since i took so much care of her and that i saw so many people drunk that night that thanked me the day after for having takin care of them ; Stupid tought, an Addict tought, a tought i told myself to not follow because of its shallowness so many times .... but not this time. 

Only one drink turned out of course into a week long binge of a daily 26 ounces of gin ( Im a heavy binger )  wich sent me straight to the ER. I woke up in the morning without any cellphone, bruises everywhere, no memory, all the good jazz. I felt helpless, i couldnt even remember my own cellphone number. It was the first moment of my life where i really wanted to just lay down, close my eyes and let the hospital do whatever the fuck they want with me in psych yard. But the love of my life, the person i've been the closest to, just appeared in my room, took me back to her place and took care of me for the usual hell of the first days of withdrawal. It wasnt the first time she did that, and everytime i just couldnt understand why i craved alcohol when i had this beauty in my life.

I still dont

Because on the 3rd day of my withdrawal, she went to work while i was at her place, and my withdrawing dumbfuck addict brain said : You know she literally holds a FULL GIN COLLECTION in her living room ? Just a sip to make the shakes go away ... she wont even notice !

Just a sip ... what a joke

I dont remember much after that first sip, next thing i knew i was sitting on her kitchen chair completely wasted while she was yelling at me every possible horrible stuff i deserved to hear at that time and sent me to the ER again. But this time she wasnt there to calm me down in the morning when my withdrawal went full force. I dragged myself back to her place. My stuff was packed. I asked her to spit her poison on me just so i could remember how alcohol destroys my life and she did ...

And its done.

In that week of relapse,  i lost ;

My lover

My self-respect

My job

My appartment

300$

My bicycle

My wallet with all cards and stuff

A backpack my sister gave me that meant a lot

and probably many more stuff that i havent discovered yet.

All of that for a poison and some good feelings.

\---------

Alcohol aint worth it folks. Rebuilding my self-esteem after i've done what i did to the person that meant the most to me and cared the most for me will be a mountain + all the life problem stuff.

But i've seen people coming back from more than this ....

So all i'll say is that today i will not drink with you. Because life and love are so much more worth it.

I work at a company that prides itself on being fairly enlightened, but that has a ‚Äúwork hard play hard‚Äù mentality that‚Äôs deeply ingrained (to say nothing of how clich√©d and bro-ey it is). I submitted an anonymous note years ago suggesting to management ways that they and staff might give more consideration to the nondrinkers who are invisibly among them. The culture seemed to improve for a time. Working remote has also been a relief, cause I‚Äôm no longer subjected to booze-soaked forced socialization.

Earlier this year, though, the company sent me a bottle of top-shelf liquor for a work anniversary. Aside from how problematic that is, and while it was well-intentioned, it just felt like this tired, lame attempt to seem edgy and kinda Mad Men -y. Anyhow, I broke my anonymity to my HR rep and told him I was in recovery, and that I felt the company should eliminate the practice of gifting alcohol to employees. *‚ÄúDo we really want to be in the practice of potentially triggering someone‚Äôs relapse? Gifting alcohol just feels like it carries risk and creates needless liability. What do we gain by trying to remain the kind of ‚Äòcool‚Äô company that gives people booze?‚Äù* I asked. I‚Äôd so have preferred if they would have simply tacked onto my paycheck the $200 they dropped on this absurd bottle that I, as a recovering alcoholic, have NO business being in possession of.

Like a lot of white collar companies over the last year, we‚Äôve been immersed in tons of DEI trainings at my company, and they've been hugely worthwhile. **I keep thinking that there's a small but important additional facet missing from many companies' broader strategies around inclusion work: creating an environment where employees who are in recovery from addiction also feel like they belong.** But it‚Äôs a dimension of inclusion work that, due to stigma and anonymity, I feel so many companies are just totally unaware of and clueless about. I‚Äôve tried a few times to find blog posts or any thought leadership that might be out there on the topic, but I‚Äôve come up dry, at least in my cursory searches.

I guess it was the combination of my fun new hobby and my success with weight loss (315 -> 230 currently, and continuing enthusiastically). It was really nice, I had a lot of people telling me that I had inspired them to explore new means of exercise or buy skates/blades/scooters for themselves.

Well, I mentioned this briefly in a group chat I sometimes frequent, and low and behold a member there also browsed this subreddit, recalled the post, and dived into my account. You know, the one with 1 loseit contribution and significantly more stopdrinking contributions. He didn't say anything.

Today I made a joke he didn't like (one I've made many times before now accusing him of having a political stance he doesn't have). Clearly he took a lot more offensive to it this time, because he responded ""better to be that than an alcoholic."" When I expressed that this was an unkind response because he wasn't politically affiliated with the right and I am an alcoholic, his response was as follows: ""I could not care less. Focus on your crippling alcohol addiction then we will have a chat."" Followed by a lot of sarcastic emojis. Nice.

And, I mean, obviously, posting on Reddit about my crippling alcoholism *is* focusing on it. I know that. I've been focusing on it for years. Ever since I first left the domestically abusive relationship that caused me to begin drinking, and found that although the assaults had stopped, my substance abuse hadn't. 

I was ready to go out the door and attend the gym in the moment this exchange happened. Very quickly, probably within the span of five minutes, I was on the floor. Sobbing. It's not... that I'm ashamed of anyone knowing that I have alcoholism? It's not a disease I wanted. And I'm doing ok regardless, so... I don't have anything to be ashamed of.

Others in the group chat ask who is a crippling alcoholic. I say I am, I have been trying to drink myself to death since the age of 21 when being forced to live with my abuser caused PTSD.  They advise that there are better ways to cope with my PTSD than alcoholism, as though I woke up one day and figured this would be the disease I dedicated my entire life to. But mostly they've been sweet and supportive. That's pretty nice. He did apologise publicly a few hours later (I did not give him the option to apologise in private.) I am not massively interested in acknowledging it.

But actually I guess I just felt like this time in particular was a good moment to check in with my favourite subreddit and say with some confidence that I do not want to be ashamed of who I am or what I've come through. I am more than a sum of my flaws, and in the circumstances, I'm doing very well. I don't think anyone else who posts here should be ashamed, either. At the end of the day, this is resource for people who are working towards a healthier life for themselves. That's pretty noble.

EDIT: Hey guys! This blew up a bit overnight and I have to say I really appreciate the support I've received from a lot of you. You've made me feel much more secure about the validity of my recovery, thank you.

I have had a few people comment that we are both assholes because I was bullying him with this joke. Well, mean jokes are kind of a longstanding dynamic with this group chat and occur very regularly from all participants, and accusing someone of being a racist tory is fairly tame compared to most jokes made in it. He's repeatedly called a lady in her 50's a ""fat disgusting pig"" before now, so clearly I thought he was capable of receiving comments in the same way he could dish them out.

Regardless, my jokes must have hurt his feelings somewhat, indicated by his reaction. I'm in no way minimising that. I just wish he'd been able to communicate that to me properly so that I could simply apologise and avoid the topic, rather than trying to humiliate me for having a disease.

Need help and not sure what else to try....,"Hi all - just wondering if anyone is familiar with this service / support group network and what their thoughts are about it. I've been to AA a few times, but it only ever seemed to make me want to drink more. I did the Alcohol Experiment and that was helpful, but it being so Facebook-heavy didn't work the best for me either (I'm almost completely off of all social media and it's been a lot better for my mental health). I've tried over and over again to get a handle on my drinking and stay sober, but I always relapse and life quickly becomes unmanageable again. I had 6 months sober in late 2019 - early 2020, but started drinking right around when COVID hit (March 2020), since then it's been up and down. 

Currently, I will be able to not drink during the week, then blackout all of Friday and Saturday. It's crushing me and the shame and guilt are so overwhelming again. This past weekend I ended up getting so drunk that I tripped and fell on my face. I don't even remember it, but I think about what could've happened. Broken nose, lost teeth. I'm so tired of this feeling and want to stop thinking, ""it could've been worse,"" until it actually is.... and I say that having already gotten a DUI and been hospitalized by my ex-boyfriend (abusive alcoholic). Thanks for anyone reading this, just needed to get this out and any advice or feedback on alternative treatment  is welcome.",4,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.72271717}"

My wife and I are one year sober from alcohol.  We quit with the help of motivational Youtube videos.

I used to smoke pot 2-3 times per week and it started to escalate... when I quit alcohol I started to smoke about 10 joints a day .... and the fact it was during covid (work from home) made it way too easy to wake and bake.

The joints didn't seem to affect my life but now I think it is.  My Dad died and I'm trying to help Mom sell her house and move.  I think it's the pot but I feel helpless, frustrated and had a fight with Mom last night because she wouldn't take a flight to come and see houses.

I have just run out of pot and will try very hard.  My wife woke up early to help... we climbed the small hill we live on to see the sunrise.. it felt great !

For anyone struggling with quitting, it does get harder.  Day 1 all I could think about was a cider on a patio and everything seemed to trigger me.  The cravings went away in 2-3 hours.

A year later, I think of alcohol once per week and only for 10 seconds.

We did slip once at new years.  It was fun for about 20 minutes (we danced/laughed) but after that I was feeling sick, sad and regretful. And I am usually a very happy guy.

So a couple days ago I, uh, ""accidentally"" told my partner about my drinking problem. AKA I was drunk and blurted it out. Not how I would have wanted to do it nor was I quite ""ready"" to tell them, but what's done is done, and I know it's a good thing in the long run. Telling them and being accountable to them was honestly the thing I was most afraid of. 

An extra element to this whole issue is that my partner is also in recovery for a different substance, a fact they didn't tell me about for more than a year and a half of our relationship. I was never mad at them for hiding this from me and I don't think they are mad at me for acting similarly. They are further along in their recovery and are a big advocate of SMART recovery meetings. 

We haven't talked about it since the night I told them and I'm not sure how to bring it back up nor do I really want to... I am recommitting to trying harder to string together a longer streak of sober days and so my current thought is to get a week under my belt then bring it back up. I don't know if my partner is waiting for me to talk about it or what. They have generally preferred to be the initiator of conversation about their own addiction struggles so it's probably that they are extending the same courtesy to me, but I also don't want them to think I'm avoiding it or hiding things.

I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt let that affect my sobriety and put it away for a few hours. I wanted to prep myself for today, so last night I went to the Convenience Store I‚Äôd typically buy drinks from to get a pack of smokes and two Monsters. The walk there was fine, and even getting in and out of the store didn‚Äôt affect me. It was the walk back home that the itch came like a warm breeze on a cold night. Thoughts of the conversation with my mentor and the simplicity of turning around haunted me. I made it 10ft from my door before I had to stop. The craving was so intense it stopped me in my tracks. A warm rush of satisfying the itch came flowing through me. Going to AA helped me recognize these feelings and I was able to snap out of it. I ran inside and shut the door on whatever was trying to get into my mind that night.

However, sometimes my guests don't drink alcohol, and so I like to offer them a mocktail instead (I'll also offer water, soda, and juice). I'm rather good at making mocktails, but I have one question for this community.

How do you feel about ingredients like extracts or cocktail bitters which contain alcohol, but are used in trace amounts in almost all cases to provide flavor without meaningfully increasing the proof of a drink. The total volume of alcohol consumed in a drink with a dash or two of bitters is probably no more than you would consume when using mouthwash. Even still, I want to be mindful. I would just ask each guest if they are okay with such ingredients, but I'm concerned that doing so may come off as me trying to toe the line with them.

I feel that the answer is just to avoid such ingredients, but since the alcohol is utterly imperceptable and in such low quantities that it could never affect you, I'm uncertain. I mean, realistically, things like vanilla extract are already used so commonly and the ultimate alcohol content of the things they're used in so low, that it's often not even considered outside of packaged goods. Avoiding these ingredients isn't a big deal, but it does further restrict my ability to create a good mocktail for them with what I have on hand - as my specialty is cocktails, not mocktails, I'm already working outside of the realm of the overwhelming majority of my ingredients.

Finally, shy, homeschooled little me could easily socialize and make friends after a few beers and some rum! Never mind that I usually ended up throwing up in the bathroom at some point (how do we convince ourselves this is fun?). Introverted, scared me started working in the service industry and became an empowered life of the party, proud of my ability to drink the boys under the table, perform my job drunk (unfortunately, this is very common among cooks),drink all night and start over again in the morning. I hosted parties at my house, proud to see that I had so many ‚Äúfriends‚Äù now. I started taking pills and doing cocaine, proud of how hard I could work (never mind my unpredictable moods and failing health). When the speed and alcohol were working as intended, I got a promotion because of my ability to just keep working. Eventually this all came crashing down as I let my addictions drive me. I walked out of my job in a drunken rage, losing countless relationships as I slid down to rock bottom. Soon I was just drinking alone, in my car before work or huddled on the couch with a bottle, cut off from the world. 

Thankfully, I am over 8 months sober from drugs and alcohol. This year has been insanely productive, from losing weight to saving money to getting a raise. I‚Äôm overall happier and can‚Äôt imagine going back. Unfortunately, I miss the false extrovert that I was when i was drinking. Emotionally and in social situations, I feel like I‚Äôm a teenager again - incredibly awkward and a little more judge mental. I don‚Äôt know what to do with my hands or make a conversation flow the way I used to. I get bouts of rage that i have NO idea what to do with, because I used to ignore anger and drink it down. Drinking made me nicer, more pleasant to be around. I liked everyone after a few, wanted to compliment you and get to know you better. Now I find myself being incredibly reserved, hiding in my mind again like when I was younger. I am trying to embrace myself, awkwardness and all, but I can‚Äôt lie and say I don‚Äôt miss the ease of interacting with people that alcohol gifted a young introvert. It‚Äôs lonelier here. 

I recognize that my mind is glossing over the true details of my active addiction. I was miserable in every way at the end, and lonely in a way that I didn‚Äôt know was possible, with all the lying and sneaking around. It didn‚Äôt matter that at one point alcohol made me an extrovert because eventually I was too anxious to go anywhere but the liquor store. I‚Äôm just not used to the ‚Äúreal me‚Äù. All of the ‚Äúprogress‚Äù I made with ten years of drinking is gone, and I‚Äôm back to dreading meeting new people and trying to remember how to have a conversation (not that living in a COVID world is helping). 

I want to lie and say I‚Äôm totally fine with this, but its been difficult. I have to choose to focus on REAL progress, which unfortunately involves feeling the full spectrum of feelings and learning how to deal with them. And I‚Äôm just going to have to accept that I‚Äôm a shy nerd who prefers reading to the drunk, wanna be life of the party I wanted to be so badly.

She drinks everyday and has confided in me before that she thinks she ""might have alcoholic tendencies"" but I don't think she recognizes it as a true problem and has not yet sought help. 

She's recently been coming around to my house a lot more over the past few months because I'm on maternity leave, and she is working from home. I've noticed that she usually starts drinking at 10am - while she's ""working"" - and never really stops. Our other best friend recently moved far away to the other coast so I'm pretty much the one left to hang out with. I think she just wants someone to drink with and does not like being alone (she is 35/single/lives alone. everyone else in our friend group is married with kids. I understand that is probably not easy and dealing with those feelings might compel her to drink as well.) 

It's now getting to the point where it is affecting my family dynamics. Things between my husband and I came to a head yesterday after she drank 3 bottles of wine while she had her 4 year old niece here. After they left this morning (she initially was just going to come over for a few hrs to visit but ended up getting too drunk to drive them home) my husband exploded on me because her behavior yesterday left him holding the bag taking care of her niece and our other kids (we have 3 kids of our own) while she got drunk. I also drank yesterday but was not out of control (had a few drinks over several hours and still took care of our kids, did housework, got everyone to bed, etc.) but now I also feel guilty that maybe I exacerbated her behavior bc I had a few drinks too and this might have been the green light she was looking for to get plastered. 

I don't want to distance myself from her without having some type of conversation with her about it but I am also extremely uncomfortable when I try and think about what I would say. My friend wavers between thinking she ""needs to cut back"" and thinking that is just her having fun so I'm not sure if she would be ready to hear what I have to say.

My other dilemma is that I would still like to be able to drink and have alcohol around (also everyone in our friend group drinks. so future outings, weddings, parties, events, etc. will all likely have alcohol present). My husband and I are having a birthday party at our house this Sunday - which is also the first football game - so it would be nice to be able to have beer/alcohol available for the other people who want to be able to drink it.  I just don't know how to approach the conversation about how I eessentially don't want her to drink while she's here because I know she won't stop and I don't want her staying overnight here again either.

This too shall pass...Thanks everyone here - all these comments gave me the strength to ask for/do what I needed for me.

short story is I'm just 4 month into not drinking...and now I'm roped into a family wedding.

a childhood friend is getting married - It's just going to be my Dad and I going...my fiance couldn't get out of work, and honestly I don't blame her for not wanting to go, but I think I'd feel a lot better about staying strong and not drinking if she was with me. she's been my rock!

my Dad has always been a big drinker, he's a trigger. This family friend is the first person I got drunk/high with when we were teenagers...

I haven't seen a lot of this family in the past ~15 years. but they check in around holidays/family events. Last time all the families were together my mom was still alive...

I just feel overwhelmed by this. I'm stressed about my fiance not coming/staying home/resenting me or something...this 'family' obligation alone is stressful. There is going to be a LOT of drinking, and all with people who really influential in my drinking...and I'm sure about 100 people I don't even recognize will just want to talk about my dead mom or the fact that I'm not drinking - both conversations I just don't want to have right now.

Because as everyone with a drinking problem knows, there is always an excuse to not not drink. This goes double the further along you get; especially if your primary motivation is shame, which is the case for me. Hopefully daily posts will help me start forming a different habit.

First day back at work after the long weekend and I'm trying to make a change, again. I didn't drink yesterday so I'm not technically hungover, but my gut's still not feeling great. Probably because I drank too much Saturday and Sunday. Our society tends to accept, even applaud, this type of behavior in your early twenties but it gets sad after that.

If I'm being honest it was sad before, just normalized. Which is an important distinction.

I've taken breaks before, with varying degrees of success. This time seems different, in that there was no instigating ""you really fucked up this time"" moment. I hung out with friends Saturday and Sunday, met all my other obligations, even hit the gym twice. Hopefully this is a sign that I'm trying to make a permanent change. Not just another reflexive response to yet another bout of shame and post-drinking anxiety.

Honestly, I'm mostly just tired. I'm tired of feeling like garbage and wasting weekends. I'm tired of compulsively fixating on embarrassing things I did when I was drunk. I'm tired of trying to count drinks, or at least not drink them too fast. Only to fail, again, to dial it back as much as I wanted. People talk about how hard being sober is, but don't seem to talk about how hard it can be to drink in moderation. Constantly monitoring your mental state, how many drinks you've had, how many everyone else has had, how long you're going to be wherever you are, and whether you've done anything particularly embarrassing is exhausting. You don't have to do that if you're just not drinking.

My plan is to start with 30 days and go from there. Today I don't feel a strong urge to drink. But I know I will tomorrow, or the day after that, or some day in the future. It's exhausting and I wish my brain didn't work like this, but it does. If you're still reading this, wish me luck.

Since the majority of that time has been during COVID, I haven't dealt with a lot of large events.  Like many other things, college football games used to be a reason for me to drink a lot.  Last weekend, I went back to my old college for the 1st game of the season.  I was actually pretty excited for it.  I feel like I have enough time under my belt that I don't worry about not being able to handle situations.  I may not love all the drinking around me, but I know how to deal with triggers.  

After the weekend, I felt conflicted about whether or not it was a good time.  I was happy to be there and to be around people I hadn't seen in a long time.  The game was exciting and there were parts of it that made me glad to be there in person as opposed to watching on TV from home.  But there were also more triggers than usual.  It seemed like everyone was drinking.  And I had literally never spent a day tailgating and going to a game without drinking.  Going into the stadium and seeing so many students and other fans who were completely blitzed was pretty depressing.  It didn't make me wish I was drinking.  But it made me uncomfortable.  We saw people who couldn't walk straight, and this was just funny to those around me.  We saw a guy puking his guts out into a trash can.  This was all before the game started and we were working our way to our seats.  I wondered how these people walked in past security and police without a problem.  I guess if they tried to stop all the drunks, the stadium would have been less than half full.  And in the stands, we saw people who could barely stand and others who were being asses toward the other fans.  I don't think these things had ever stood out to me so much or seemed like such a problem.  The people I was with weren't hammered, but they also didn't seem to be bothered.  

I have plans to go back to another game.  I just feel very alone in this experience because everyone else I know can't wait to go back.  I feel like I'm going because I need to keep proving to myself that I can do it.  I don't want to avoid my friends and these events that have always meant a lot to me.  My friends are accepting of my sobriety, and I want to enjoy the parts of these events that are enjoyable.  

I don't know that I had a point in writing this.  If anything, I feel like I read people's stories of doing things without alcohol and everything sounds wonderful.  While I did enjoy being there, I feel like my experiences are still coming with challenges and downsides.  I'm in no way thinking it wasn't worth being sober.  There's still the upside that I was able to drive after the game.  I woke up without a hangover the next day.  And I also didn't have the urge to turn that one day into a multi day binge.

This time apart from the fact I haven‚Äôt slept the last 2 nights - apart from maybe two hours - and Sod‚Äôs law I have a rotten head cold, I actually feel fine - no shakes, no cravings etc - but I‚Äôm worried it might be the calm before the storm.

When I gave up last time, I‚Äôd been drinking 2 bottles of wine a night.  This time round it was months of vodka and soda - sometimes (almost daily in the last couple of months) a large bottle (75cl).

My worry is - I‚Äôve read about the dangers of DT‚Äôs and I‚Äôve scared myself.  Does anyone know if I‚Äôd have had worse withdrawal symptoms already if I was at risk of DT‚Äôs?

My worry is that because I was drinking so very much this time - they might kick in sometime soon.  I‚Äôm home alone, I don‚Äôt know how sudden it happens, or if I‚Äôd be aware / alert enough to seek help?

I don‚Äôt want to admit my drinking to family or my GP (doctor), as believe it or not I‚Äôve been a functioning alcoholic and have kept my drinking hidden.

Does anyone have any experience of actual
DT‚Äôs who could advise me?

I don‚Äôt want to have another drink to cut down gradually now I‚Äôve gone so long without one‚Ä¶

Damn am I thankful for that.

I don't drink a lot actually, I hardly ever get drunk, not since college but since covid has happened and everyone is so happy to be social again, and with stress on a steady increase around here, it's become progressively easier to have a drink or two with friends, sometimes multiple times a week.

There are waves, sometimes frequent (a few days in a row), sometimes not. But I feel it's trending slightly in the direction I don't want. And I think the worst aspect is that even a bit drastically alters my sleep.

When I was drinking a lot in college, I almost forgot what it feels like to be well rested. Let me tell you, it's way better than any drink you could have. And you could view the money you save as being paid to get good sleep and feel better. But then I ask myself, why do I keep reaching casually for the glass?

It's honestly pretty typical behavior of so many I know, and socially normalized. I have had drinks when I know I shouldn't have and it's gotten in the way of what I find important a couple times and I don't want to continue that.

So today, I realized idealistic thinking to myself isn't going to get me there, and that doesn't make me weaker, just wiser, knowing that a community, even a virtual one is a huge help to get to where I want to go.

 Alcoholism is in my family. I'm thankful my parents are the furthest thing from alcoholics and I'd like to continue that trend and furthermore cut it out, maybe completely.

I'm finally doing ME and showing the world what I'm really made of. Dealing with all your raw feelings and emotions is intimidating as hell but it's how you grow and find yourself. 

So those days that you're really like damn I need a drink , no you fucking don't. Most days of my sobriety I have spent white knuckling it and even though I wouldn't recommend it you DONT need that drink.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

This post goes up at:

* US - Night/Early Morning
* Europe - Morning
* Asia and Australia - Evening/Night

A link to the current Daily Check-In post can always be found near the top of the sidebar.

------------

An early check-in today, because my day's starting early (it's 6am here). It is so lovely and inspiring reading through everyone's check-ins and comments and responses to the ""stopping points"". Keep them coming!

Today's offering comes from the book *Creative Recovery*.

""Practice ‚Äúbusting yourself.‚Äù Whenever you begin to move in the direction of unnecessary drama, whenever you allow an addiction trigger a foothold, whenever you veer away from your recovery program, jump out of your seat and cry, ‚ÄúBusted!‚Äù Then do the sober thing.""

What do you think? It recalls, for me, the ""relapse ladder"" post I discovered through this sub; I'll see if I can find the link to share...there's a part that says something to the effect of ""the way to get off the ladder is to TELL ON YOUR ADDICTION!"" ie, to talk about it and name what's going on. To 'fess up about it. I like this ""Busted!"" thing, too, myself.",166,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55203485}"

I am feeling better than I used to, when I drank daily and heavily. 

This is not my ideal, I do wish to become sober for life but things, bits and bobs, odds and sods do catch me out. (Bit of English slang for you all)

I spoke today with a long term sober alcoholic, this good chap took time to chat with me while discussing many things. My work, his work, picture framing, donkeys, movies I know, movies he knows, favourite drinks while sober (coke, tea, apple juice, water). 

He spotted me the second I walked through the door of his shop, I could see his look. He didn't prompt a conversation, yet rapidly chat started and turned to my current sour feeling due to drinking on friday and where it came from. He was great, old and influential.

The only point to this is.....

You, me, we....all of us. We are in this together, he saw in my eyes what he looked like many many years ago, and took the time to back my inner strength, with his attention to detail and personal inner strength. 

I know I'm ready to begin again with more strength than before, be strong fellow redditors. 

It's a good day I hope for you all

Almost 35 and I have been drinking since my
20s. I‚Äôd always drink a lot and I had two kids & cut it down but the last few months I started to really struggle with it again & was worried about what it was going to do to my life & what I would lose if I continued down the path I was going.  I was never one to drink from morning to night but I was starting to hide my liquor, constantly thinking about my next drink & never could really moderate my drinking.  I would drink to ‚Äúcure‚Äù my anxiety which clearly was caused by my drinking as anytime I would take breaks from alcohol my anxiety would magically go away but for some reason I used anxiety as an excuse to drink & in turn, I would get even more anxious. 

The last month I really wanted to stop drinking but I was struggling & I was stuck in a cycle of drinking, being hungover/anxious & drinking again to beat that & continuing that over & over until I thought this fucking sucks.  Told myself September 1st was the day no matter how hard it was & I am proud (even though it‚Äôs only been 6 days) that I‚Äôm almost at a week.  The first few days I felt like I had a flu so clearly some sort of withdrawals but I‚Äôm over that now. 

It‚Äôs insane how much better my sleep is.  So happy to not wake up at 2/3am every night with my mind racing.  Even if I sleep 5 hours nowI feel SO much more rested than before.

But wine and I were best friends, until we weren't. My husband knows this, he threatened divorce over my drinking. He knows how hard I worked to quit. So, how do I ask him not to bring it in the house?

It's not just the temptation, it's a slap in the face - He can drink but I can't! 

Is this my penance? Should I just put up and shut up?

Someone on here said fight for your sobriety tooth and nail. And boy, second to my son, I think this might be the thing I want to fight for most in this world. It feels so precarious, but right, but still like I might lose it, and I don't want to take it for granted or risk it. Being sober makes me 28% closer to the person I want to be.

2021-09-06 17:08:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pj8k8o/365_ride/,365 Ride,"This is another 1 year post, but this is specifically for the daily warriors struggling and fighting tooth and nail for their sobriety.   One year ago, after a long day out celebrating my wife and my anniversary, I woke up to that all too familiar fuzzy regret feeling.   However, there was no grand act of idiocy or verbal exchange seared into my memory.  In fact, it was a really great day with my wife.  Except for the fact that it felt like someone had pressed their thumb across my memory bank, and leaving me no granular detail to fondly recollect.  The regret came as I as began to realize that this forfeiture was the general feeling I have had the last twenty years.

After staring into the abyss, I decided to take a break from drinking for a bit.  One day became two, and several became a month.   A month's time frame was the longest I had previously come after a few white knuckle Dry-uary or Sober Octobers in a few years past.  I quickly became listless and untethered as my urges crept back up in full force and I decided to try out some quit lit to try and gain some perspective.   I became ravenous and consumed all manner of books and podcasts.  My pink cloud came and sobriety was great.  I was working out again, engaged with my family, and more productive than ever.  I also was prepping my ""tool kit"" for when the pink cloud left because I knew motivation alone would not carry me on this journey.  Well, when everyone here says that sobriety doesn't cure your problems, but it allows you to finally deal with them, I found you better fucking believe them.

Sometime in the dark of winter, my pink cloud began to wane.  The best way to describe what happened next is if you were to take 20 years of arrested emotional development and dump them all in one pile on your chest and its up to you to find your way to the surface.  I was fucking ANGRY.  Not like an irritable itch agitation,  but like a white-hot, put your fist through the nearest wall all the time.  Where was my super awesome progress? Where was my weight loss so I could post unicorns and rainbows to reddit and reap that sweet, sweet karma? Where was the easy part of dealing with relationships, And where, oh where was my fucking enlightenment?   Ladies and gentlemen, I can easily say now, but unbeknownst to me at the time, that I had arrived at the work.

To those on this journey, there will come a point that all your physical work will begin to pay off and a new set of challenges will come for you to progress through.  Religious affiliation aside, deeper work awaits you within.  Your journey will be very personal and very different even amongst your sober peers.  The challenges you have faced on the daily are but a step on the path to put you where you are today.  And all those steps and challenges can happen for a reason.  I don't say that they DO, as it is up to you to decide that life is happening FOR us, not TO us.

Needless to say, I had some inner healing that needed to occur.  I asked for help.  I found a coach and I found a community.    I started to let go of expectations and started to learn how to love myself.  Including all the ""shitty"" parts of my past that I carried around regret for so long for.  Integration of all your experiences is a wonderful gift.  I was trying so hard to ""ascend"" from my past mistakes that all I was doing was putting distance between me and reality.  In the words of Mister Rogers, ""I like you just the way you are.""   Coming to believe that with every fiber of my being is where the difficulty came in.  But I am worth it.  And so are you.

My journey is still in progress.  Instead of saying ""there is so much work to be done,"" I have found solace in rephrasing that to  ""there is always work I get to do.""  I love the work each of you put in daily. I love that you come and share here during difficult times and good times.  I love that your journey may not be perfect either because finding that resolution and self-love to overcome is where the real magic happens.  IWNDWT.

My resources (no particular order, and not comprehensive):

BOOKS

* *This Naked Mind* by Annie Grace - there is a specific reason this book gets suggested so much.
* *Alcohol Lied to Me* by Craig Beck - this was my first book and was a punch to the gut to keep me moving on quit lit
* *Alcohol Explained* by William Porter - A little drier than the other 2, but goes into detail a bit more on how alcohol works
* *The Big Book* by Anonymous - I have an issue with the higher power thing like some here, but this taught me my best lesson other than AA is not for me.  On your personal journey, take what YOU need and leave the rest.  There are some gems in this book and step 4 can be very powerful once you can frame it in your voice.
* *Expectation Hangover* by Christine Hassler - If there is one book here I hope to impart you with, it would be this one

I just hit 30 days [again]. I sometimes go to AA, but prefer Recovery Dharma and SMART. Both of these do not require a belief in higher power. 

I‚Äôve started to become more open to the idea of spirituality from Dharma and Buddhism in general, however I feel it differs from the type of spirituality in 12-step programs. While, Dharma and SMART are still not very popular, I go to AA because I can meet more people and learn/discuss new perspectives. That being said, I‚Äôm not totally bought in to the 12-step program. 

My question is for those who have found success in 12-steps, specifically with a higher power, and why you feel that program is good for recovery. 

I also want to hear from those who aren‚Äôt in a traditional program and have found success, and what aspects of recovery you have found to be most influential.

I never thought I could make it a week without the drink, but somehow (Like many of us) I was able to find a way. 

I've been moved and empowered by a lot of stories and insights here so I thought I'd share mine for people who might be going through similar changes I faced:

1) People don't forget about your drinking, but they also don't forget how hard you try to stop drinking

2) The people you used to drink with will understand that your break is about your health, not anything they did (If they're actual friends) 

3) Ginger beer, homemade lemonade, and other refreshing beverages are underrated gems that can absolutely help with cravings

4) Addiction and obsession are two very different but very related processes of the human mind - you might be suffering from both and just be treating one at any given moment

5) Your identity becomes more cemented without booze - this is scary as hell, but empowering as hell. Suddenly you have a whole-ass person to meet again, learn about, and help grow

6) There's sometimes beautiful reminders of how far you've come - cleaning something with alcohol for instance, getting hit with that intense smell, and saying ""Shit I used to drink that?""

7) Guilt tells you the problem, but is never the solution by itself - beating yourself up or developing a martyr complex just increases the likelihood of relapse based on high stakes expectations for oneself 

8) You're never the only person going through this, and people ""have it easier"" or ""have it worse"" but the point is that we all ""have it"" and can learn from each other regardless 

9) Booze costs a lot of money (Especially if you were a bar-fly like me) and those recouped costs can change your life entirely

10) It's okay to not be okay, bad days are just bad days when you remember there's good ones coming too

Bonus: You've gotten through so much in your life, many of us, and this is just another challenge we're more than capable of taking on. Let's keep doing it together and not just by ourselves - We can be as man and not try to be as superman.

I knew that this company has a lot of alcohol brands as clients, events, even their own labeled beer. What I wasn‚Äôt expecting was seeing so much alcohol openly around the office on people‚Äôs desks, the kitchen area, etc. 

While the job and company are very cool, I am thinking more about the prevalence of alcohol in the workplace, supporting alcohol brands and marketing, and the overall availability of alcohol. I currently do not keep any alcohol in my home and my husband keeps his beer in the garage and doesn‚Äôt bring the cans/bottles into the house.

I believe that all our experiences are encoded somewhere in our brains, including those we had as a baby and toddler

Consider what we experienced as babies (LIST 1):

\-- unadulterated joy (think of babies smiling and laughing)

\-- no depression (no reflection on how awful the world can be and has been to us)

\--no anxiety (no concept of the future)

\--no responsibilities

\--not worrying about the feelings or needs of others

Then there‚Äôs also (LIST 2):

\--raw rage (think temper tantrums)

\--loud crying when something is wrong (drunks can be crybabies, right?)

\--lack of bodily coordination/function control (falling, peeing, pooping, vomiting)

\--inability to talk clearly (baby talk)

\--lack of awareness of surroundings (bumping into things)

\--inability to recognize and avoid danger (stupid risk taking)

\--reaching for things that could harm you (craving: I want, I want, I want)

Do we drink to experience what‚Äôs in List 1, but end up bamboozled by List 2?

Are there ways to get SOME of the positives in List 1 WITHOUT drinking and thus avoid List 2?

Lately, I‚Äôve started admonishing myself when I experience a craving: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be bamboozled by this crybaby craving. You know where it leads. It‚Äôs fantastic to be a grownup and not a little kid.‚Äù

HOWEVER, we also need occasional times to do less ‚Äúadulting‚Äù which gets tedious sometimes, right?

This most recent hospital visit was a little different. They were concerned about me having a seizure that they put padding on the rails of the hospital bed. I was in pretty bad shape.

Luckily it wasn't. Doctor told me that I'm at the final stage where my liver can still repair itself. I was relieved. Then instantly sad as I look over to my mother.

I feel they were getting progressively worse and this one isn't the worst one. It gives me optimism and worries me at the same time. I usually struggle the first month with cravings from hell multiple times a day. I have had 2 cravings that I can remember and I just rode them out. Did some meditation techniques from previous alcohol treatment programs I've been to. Replayed the tape in my head of what will happen if I drink and so far it's working. I've been avoiding driving the same routes that take me past the usual liquor stores. I'm still bracing for that moment where I argue in my head not to take the left turn and to turn right instead and go home. It hasn't happened yet but it's almost certain. I lose that battle 9 out of 10 times.

I've come here to tell some of my story, as most of you know it helps a lot to just put it out there. Also to thank all of you for sharing your stories. I've been coming to this account everyday for the past month and I appreciate how encouraging and helpful the community is. Again, Thank you.

Later that night I reasoned with myself (not drunk but absolutely under influence); I decided to permit myself those drinks given the occasion and the following day is a normal day where I have no reason to continue. Besides breaking my own rule I feel I was responsible and made better decisions even if they weren't the 100% correct ones. I have such a small social circle, that this excuse is going to be incredibly rare.

But the biggest reason I decided to permit this rare occasion is because we're now after the event and I don't think it's fair to beat myself up over one responsibleish evening on when I've spent 6 days (and counting) off which is such a huge step forward for me. Likewise I don't want to create a future allowance/target to drink up to. How would you count? In early days perhaps it's no so damaging to just reset the counter, by the end of the year, a week will be nothing, but I know others have gone a lot longer and fallen a lot less.

2021-09-06 08:12:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/piy8t1/a_good_reminder/,A good reminder,"We awoke last night around midnight, to our youngest son Jonas pounding on our bedroom door. He explained how he‚Äôd been woken from sleep by bright headlights that were still shining in his bedroom window with random horn honking that was causing Desi to bark. 
Someone had pulled in to our rental home‚Äôs driveway alone and was acting very strangely in the driver‚Äôs seat. Kenny got out of bed and went out to the driveway to try and gauge the situation. He returned seconds later stating that the man inside the vehicle was in fact drunk, or high, or having an episode, or something.?.?.?. I said call 911! The man couldn‚Äôt comprehend anything but was apparently having an animated conversation with himself, (sudden arm and hand movements, etc.) It was SCARY!!!! so we called the local authorities and all piled into one of our bathrooms, which provided the best view of the blinding headlights and man in the unknown car.

Within minutes fire trucks üöí üë©‚Äçüöí, an ambulance, and three cop cars were at our vacation home. At one point we counted how many rescue workers were there trying to assess the situation. I think there were around 9? The man behind the wheel alternated in and out of consciousness while officers and EMT‚Äôs worked with him to get a coherent response. He would occasionally try to talk or react to their requests, only to fall back in to unconsciousness within seconds. 
This went on for almost an hour.
Eventually they dragged his unconscious (drunk - not dead yet)  body from the car, put him on a gurney, in to an ambulance and off to the hospital.

Soon after the man was taken and we were all about to return to bed, the police knocked on our door and wanted to question my husband. Kenny explained what we woke up to, and the officer then explained what they found. The man behind the wheel, ‚ÄúPaul‚Äù was safe and alive, but drunker than anyone else the police officer stated he had ever encountered before. He felt certain that Paul had severe alcohol poisoning. He went on to say that because Paul had pulled in to our ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù drive and they didn‚Äôt see him operating the car he likely couldn‚Äôt be charged with drunk driving, and because they didn‚Äôt have the keys, they‚Äôd likely be back in the morning to tow Paul‚Äôs car.

We are on vacation in Oak Island üèù NC. This is a very touristy place. I‚Äôm guessing Paul is on vacation too because his car has out of state plates. I‚Äôm also guessing Paul‚Äôs about the same age as Kenny and I - maybe a few years older from what I could see from the bathroom window. I‚Äôm sure he has family and friends waking up devastated this morning, confused by last night‚Äôs events and unsure how to navigate from here. 
I feel for them all. I‚Äôve been there. 
I watched this poor man being worked on by medical personnel for over an hour, without having any recognition, or idea of what was going on around him. This can happen to anyone. Alcoholism is no joke and affects everyone it encounters. If you or someone you know is struggling with this awful disease, there is hope. I am always willing to share my personal experience, strength and hope on this extremely important topic.

Woke up this morning feeling grateful to be sober, and also praying for Paul and all of Paul‚Äôs people. üíö

I just wanted to introduce myself and post something to help keep me accountable, I guess.  


I wouldn't consider myself an alcoholic or anything, I can easily enough go a few weeks without a drink or feeling any urge. However, I do absolutely hate being blackout drunk, and I don't like the person I become when I am in that state. I've suffered from depression on and off for the best part of the last decade. After a lot of work on myself in that regard, it's something I'm pretty good at keeping under control, and I'm generally quite a happy person day-to-day now. Where I slip up is when I go out at weekends with friends, and always end up getting overly drunk. That's the one thing that typically brings back the feelings and emotions of depression, and I don't cope with it very well. I typically either get very sad, or very agitated.   


This past weekend, I was in a bar, one that I didn't really want to be at, but my friends insisted on it, and it was one of their birthdays, so I felt like I had to make the effort. This bar is in the most student-y part of town (I'm not in that demographic) and is pretty much what you'd expect, just a hotbed of boozed up 20-somethings high on testosterone. Unsurprisingly, as the night went on, my misery grew, and I ultimately ended up getting into an argument with a group of guys over the most petty issues imaginable, and ended up taking a punch in the neck from one of them. I feel like it's the absolute final straw for me and I don't want to be the guy who gets into these types of situations anymore.   


I've realised that when I haven't been blackout drunk for a week or two, things are going well, I'm happy, depression seems a long way off. But then I go for a big night out, the alcohol brings back the depression, and then I have to live with the consequences of anything stupid that happened while I was drunk, and it takes a good few weeks to get it all out of my head and feel like I'm in a better place again. I'm realising now that this is a vicious cycle and I'm pretty sure that cutting out alcohol is what needs to be done to break it.

  
So I guess this is day 1. I'd like to think that sometime in the future I can enjoy a couple of beers with my friends again, in an environment I'm comfortable with, but I feel like I have to work on getting better at saying no and knowing when to stop, so I'm going to make the effort to cut it out completely for at least the remained of 2021, and see how I can benefit from that.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.65924937}"

Ninety-ish days ago, walking back from 7-11 after beating the midnight alcohol sales cut-off, one of my legs completely seized up and I faceplanted into the weedy, trash-filled ditch by this busy road.

My nutrition is also not bad, not perfect by any means, but pretty good I'd say.

I'm 43 and should be in pretty good shape for my age, but the caliper and the scale say I've put on 5 kg of pure fat over a course of 10 years - which is not a whole lot, but given my lifestyle it should be much better. My cholesterol and blood pressure are pretty high as well - which, theoretically, they shouldn't, but they are.

And there's only one thing to blame: My daily alcohol consumption over the course of a decade at least. Putting those 700 to 900 calories with zero other nutritional value, besides being toxic, in your body every day does that to you. And no amount of exercise can compensate that.

The problem came on Friday when we opened another bottle and I didn't stop after one glass. That is always my problem, if there is wine left I need to refill. I hate the feeling of knowing someone else might drink my ""share"" of the bottle.

I even got upset at my husband yesterday when I realized he threw away the last of the wine from the day before. We solved it by opening another full one, which I promptly finished.

I am weighing self-referring for some in-patient program or whatever is available in the Army to help with my alcohol addiction. I have tried self-rehabilitation, but I am still drinking nightly and see no end in sight if I‚Äôm honest.

I am an Army Officer. I have a clearance. Honestly, though, I am less concerned now about those things than I am about getting my behaviors in a better place, which is why I‚Äôm bringing it up. No matter how long we serve, the Army is a temporary job, and I have to live with myself all the time. I want to get better.

I have had no legal or performance issues; I want to refer myself entirely voluntarily. I am aware my command will probably be notified, but those are small potatoes at this point. Ok, so let‚Äôs get into it.

Background: I used to be a good Officer. All superior ratings, close to maxing physical fitness tests back when that mattered, never had any height /weight issues. Now after COVID and teleworking I have fallen into bad habits. I can get away with being hungover, unshaven, and fat because I telework so much. And so, honestly, I am that nearly every day. We are transitioning to going back into the office though, and I want to fix myself before my new habits become insurmountable. I can probably hide them, but I would prefer to fix them.

Currently: I am overweight. I drink every day and can‚Äôt sleep at an appropriate time unless I‚Äôve had some drinks. But then those ‚Äúsome drinks‚Äù become 10 beers, and I don‚Äôt physical training or do much significant work during business hours. Again, I‚Äôve had no disciplinary problems and show up in person only when I have to, but usually I do so in baggy clothes, with a ton of cologne, and having spent an hour fixing my breath and shaving/cutting my hair.

Problem: I have packets in for a few things. Branch transfer, education programs, etc. Will my self-enrollment in whatever ASAP/SUDD-C rehab preclude my acceptance into those transfers/programs if the boards meet while I am receiving treatment? Will I be flagged even for self-referral?  I feel like moving to a new phase of my career will help with my alcohol abuse, but I also don‚Äôt want to put off seeking treatment. The most important is actually fixing myself, not faking it or putting it off.

I put a lot of thought into it beforehand and decided it was something I wanted to try. I was anticipating to see if that warm fuzzy feeling would come with the first few sips, but it ended up feeling like more of an annoying buzzing in my head. It felt distracting and took me out of the present moment. I was tipsy by the time I finished my first drink and a headache set in, despite pounding back water throughout my outing with my girlfriend.

I stayed out with my friend and realized hours later that I would have left much earlier in the night due to the eventual noise level in the tiny bar that we were in. My year of sobriety taught me that I am actually extremely sensitive to stimuli, and that I had been using alcohol in the past in order to dull incoming noise, etc.

I got a headache, acid reflux and couldn‚Äôt sleep around 2am. My ears were ringing later in bed from all the drunk people yelling around me. My friend was telling me a story of her girlfriends being in town for wedding planning and that they drank every day, sometimes throwing up before the next days brunch just so they could continue drinking and doing their activities. My brain honestly couldn‚Äôt compute where the humour or entertainment was in this.

Anyways, you might be wondering why I even tried it at all. I was curious. My year off of booze was illuminating and I wondered what it would be like to return to it knowing what I know now. I also feel like I‚Äôve been mourning the party girl I once was. I never stay long at social gatherings because usually the stimulus gets to be too much. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm missing out always leaving early. But my experiment in returning to it showed me I‚Äôm not really going to miss out on much and the physical toll is still there even when I can control my intake.

My only concern looking ahead is concerts. They were a big part of my life pre-COVID, but now I wonder how I‚Äôll ever make it through the noise without a drink. (If anyone has suggestions I‚Äôd love to hear them. I already wear earplugs and I don‚Äôt handle weed.)

Night 1 went great and I slept for like 11 hour straight.

Night 2 (today): I fell asleep around 03:30, woke up around 05:30, tried getting back to sleep, got sleep paralysis just before falling asleep, got fully awake, drank some water and doing something on my phone, tried getting back to sleep, got sleep paralysis again...

Now I'm here and can't fall asleep after 2 f****n hours of sleep.

Did this happen to someone else? If yes, did the sleep paralysis got away?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

---------

One of the (many!) things I love about the daily check-ins is, well, the *daily*-ness of it. It lends the sobriety project a simplicity my overthinking mind really really needs. 

Ajahn Amaro puts it like this: ""So one of the simple practices that I like to encourage, particularly if you have that sense of busyness and non-stopness in your days, is to develop stopping points, what I like to call micro-meditations. These are very simple and they really are micro. For example, when you get up in the morning and go into the kitchen to get your breakfast together, before you touch the tap or the toaster or the kettle, just stop and stand in the middle of your kitchen.""

He's talking about this in the context of meditation practice, but it applies as much to the daily check-in here, for me. It's a daily stopping point that reminds me that no matter what, I will not drink today. 

What are your stopping points?

I was drugged and raped. The next couple weeks I started drinking more to temporarily numb the pain. A couple weeks in and I had a suicide attempt. I took a big handful of aspirin and just sat there on the couch for a few minutes, really thinking about what I was about to do. I just didn't want to feel the mental turmoil and emotional pain anymore. Thankfully my mom woke up and got out of her room and saw the open bottle of aspirin on the table and saw I was holding something in my hand. She made me put the aspirin away and I went back to bed. Since then I didn't really drink anymore, scared of what might happen. 
   My last drink was June 23 I think. I realized I had been drinking to cope with other past traumatic events, and the suicide attempt was a catharsis. Once that happened, it felt like all the built up pressure just came out and deflated.

It's 9PM on Sunday and it's a holiday weekend. I can't really sleep or focus too long at the moment, so I figured I'd post here and share a bit.

I got a job offer on Friday. 

I've been unhappy with my current job for a while now and I have been applying all over the place. I've gotten quite a few interviews, but never a worthy offer. I did get a couple offers for different roles than I applied for, which just happened to pay less and would require me to move.

It's been a really frustrating year...

This is the first time I've had this happen in my career. I usually find a job within the first month of looking. I'm not sure if it's my age or the fact that I'm more specialized in what I do now, but this time was different.

Anyway, after a long long stretch of perseverance, I finally got an offer! 

The job is for a small consulting firm. I would be working 100% remote. 100% with the tools I specialize in, with no corporate bureaucracy. I'd just design, build, and support some really cool systems for all kinds of clients. Then give them the keys and move on to the next project.

Continuing training is encouraged and paid for. There's an opportunity to travel once the pandemic is over if I want. I would start out with a 30% raise above my current job and have a defined path to advance and earn more as I learn more. I am still waiting on the official offer in writing, but that should come through after the holiday. 

I am not sure why, but I am nervous and anxious. I have been since Friday. Sometimes that changes to excitement but that doesn't last long before I start to worry about all the potential issues. After typing this out, the job is objectively better than my current role, so I'm not sure what I'm so worried about. 

I DO know that I DON'T want to drink. I just wanted to share this with the universe and the rest of the sobernauts out there. I'm only on day 5 of this current run, but I've had more sober days in 2021 than I have had in the last four years because of this sub. 

It's mainly because of all of you and the continuous support you offer us even after we fall off the wagon and show back up after being gone a while.

Docs thought it may have been meningitis but I didn't have most of the symptoms.
And so they told me I am probably just fighting a viral infection. 
Blood work came back fine. Urine came back fine. They looked at how my heart was doing and my heart was beating normally, just very fast.
Tested me for covid. They said it was unlikely since I was double vaxxed, but it was still a possibility. Told me it could be alcohol withdrawl but due to binging only twice a week, they thought it was unlikely as well. Told me it was probably just some viral infection, to get fluids and some food down. Still a bit worried for my health, but the basics are out of the way.
I just hope nothing worse happens from this and that I get better soon.

It usually takes a lot of drinks for me to be buzzed and the weird part is that i go from totally sober to a blackout and i dont thinks thats normal or healthy. I thought las Saturday was the worst because I arrived at a party and one hour passed and i was already in a blackout that lasted at least 3-4 hours and i hate not remembering and having people telling you the horrible embarrassing things that i did but at least by the end i kind of sober up a bit and got home safely. Yesterday was my awakening moment. I started the night by drinking but i was not getting buzzed i was fine most of the night but around 11 they offered me a lot of drinks and i drank a small bottle by myself and i dont remember anything, i was running alone on the streets, i fell down a couple times or i assumed because of my bruises. I went back to the place and i didn‚Äôt know anyone so I don‚Äôt know if i was alone or not. Two girls took care of me and called my friends and waited outside for them to come get me and took me home. I don‚Äôt remember anything but i think it was my worst. I got hoe and my mom heard and she said i looked as if i had been roofied, that i repeated the same frases like 10 times, i invented things and was imaginingstuff, i peed myself and she was scared. I finally fell asleep but i have the worst guilt, i feel awful, im afraid of myself, pf my lack of control, my image with my friends, my health, my friendships. I cant keep doing this i have a problem and i had it for years. I think i have been lucky because i have been exposed to dangerous situations a lot. I meed advice, motivation to stop to learn how to drink responsibly. To stop having blackouts and to love myself.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7695799}"

I already knew the amount of drinking I was doing wasn‚Äôt good for me, so when I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore I was like well okay might as well go sober, but one year later alcohol is still all I think about.
My life is pretty good otherwise, I have an active social life and I tell everyone that I‚Äòm totally fine with not drinking anymore, but honestly I‚Äòm not, and I spend so many hours thinking about it and wishing I could do it again. At this point it‚Äòs literally all I want, I would give up so much for it and it‚Äòs the only thing that truly makes me happy. 
I know this mindset fucking sucks and I‚Äòm trying to get over it, but it‚Äòs so hard sometimes. Even if my stomach ever recovers I‚Äôll try to stay away from alcohol because I know with a mindset like that I probably shouldn‚Äôt touch alcohol ever again, but I‚Äòm only 19 and the thought of never being able to drink again makes me more depressed than i‚Äòve ever been and I just feel so alone with this, since no one I know irl has ever struggled with substance abuse.",11,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.75054145}"

I‚Äôve hit this weight once before‚Ä¶and then I lost it all and got to a comfortable/happy place in 2018 when I stayed sober. In December ‚Äò18 I started drinking again and the weight has slowly crept back on (based on my iPhone pics‚Ä¶.the pandemic sped it up a lot). About 45lbs up in total.  

I know it‚Äôs vain and I have no problem with any weight‚Ä¶as long as someone feels comfortable, and I do not. Also, I have no clothes. Literally. I decided to clean my room/closet tonight and as an experiment I‚Äôm putting everything that doesn‚Äôt fit me in a pile. I really would be left with almost nothing. What a depressing way to wake up every morning. It‚Äôs just adding to the sadness. 

So I‚Äôm keeping this going for many reasons, but this is one of them. I‚Äôm going to purge the depression closet and keep working towards a place that I‚Äôm happy (& have something to wear).

We made the best of it though, hugged it out, laughed it off, then ended up heading out again, to what eneded up being a remarkably great visit to a store for him. Long story short, we didnt expect it at all, but he was like a kid on Christmas after that, it was so great to see such a big smile!

Then we got home, wached a whole bunch of Netflix and ate like every kind of icecream we have... and I assure you, there are several kinds.

It was supposed to be a dual wedding at an entirely different location but my fiance and I cancelled due to Covid and personal reasons.

Leading up to the stag i had a long text chain with the best man about my stance on drinking, ""that's no fun man""  ""it only happens once in his life"", ""can't you make an exception"", and finally, ""ok, you do you"".  Well thanks a lot guy i barely know, thanks for your permission to continue not drinking, bizarre.

Went to the stag party knowing i wouldn't drink. I hadn't realized how much my family and friends connected with me due to my history of partying. I used to be the guy who was the life of the party and who might take it too far.  I was definitely the guy who would be so hungover and crippled with anxiety the next day that i would barely function.

I received an ironic ""stag party drinking team"" tshirt to boot.  I didn't drink for the night, ended up being the dd.  On my last designated driver  trip an old friend asked if i would have a drink now...  I was frustrated by how they didnt hear me, that i wasnt drinking, hadn't since new years, and didn't  intend to for the trip.  The message just didn't seem to get through.  As the night wore on eyes got read, voices were louder, stories were wandering and pointless, repeating.

Still at the stag and sitting by my brother he mentioned that he hopes i will drink next week, at the wedding.  I said i probably won't, he seemed to get angry, ""i hope you do"".  He explained how he purchased these Viking Ale Horns to drink from for the Groomsman, they were from Scandinavia, etc. Etc.  I deferred, "" you will have to ask E(my fiance)"", dodging the awkward obligation.  Again, i was surprised at how  i was being pressured, he knew how i used to drink... can't he see I'm trying to improve and perhaps address this generational battle with drugs and alcohol.  Anyway, i did not drink that night and told my fiance and dad about the predicament.

The next night my dad came over to see the kids and bbq, he brought some drinks and put one in front of me, ""maybe this will work for you, its low alcohol"", it was some 4% seltzer.  I felt angry, i told him no, how I'm not drinking right now, and expressed my confusion, given the conversations we've been having.  Over the week leading to the wedding i was dodging and deferring drinks, explaining my position, feeling stressed that my brother would be mad if i didn't drink for the Ale Horn.

Reflux or indigestion is the main (well, most immediately apparent) physical ailment related to my alcohol abuse. I struggled more and more to eat less and less food over the course of several days (just felt like there wasn't room for more than a couple bites, didn't want to get to the point of throwing up) but hey, was still able to drink just fine... and continued to do so until I got to the point where I can do neither. 

&#x200B;

I only started truly considering quitting about 14 months ago. Prior to that, I had never experienced withdrawing like I now have several times since. I forget if I've thrown up four or five times today - this has always been my main symptom of withdrawal when I stop drinking suddenly. I have experienced stronger nausea and vomiting on previous day 1s than I am today, but the throwing up phase did extend over 24hrs the last time so it seems to be getting longer each time I put my body through this.

I have had a variety of bad experiences with medical professionals so I've never truly admitted to any just how much I drink - with the exception of an ongoing clinical behavioral study for which I am completely honest. I have only very mildly considered scheduling days off, and arranging for my (now 13 yr old) to be with dad or a grandma, so that I can do this with assistance. Like many people, I prefer not to admit weakness or ask for help. I haven't ever gone into any sort of urgent care for withdrawal symptoms, though I strongly considered it once about a year ago when my throat was torn and bleeding. Usually I am feeling better by the time day 3 rolls around than I do on my average day of drinking, even though this has been a very consistent habit for over a decade now. The most I've gotten to was 30 days earlier this year - it was a goal timed to end on my birthday, I met the goal and hoped I could follow it with moderation, but that went out the window quicker than I ever thought I would let it.

While considering the possibility that this round could always get worse before it gets better, I'm kicking myself for not switching my Primary Care Physician - I've never met the one auto-selected for me by my HMO plan and don't even know what hospital network they are with. I also hate knowing the added cost of losing my 8 hours of paid time off for Labor Day if they wanted to keep me long enough that I needed to take a sick day on Tuesday. I know others have it so much worse as far as access to care, and I'm choosing to not use the resources available to me (and for which I pay dearly out of each pay check whether I use them or not) and how foolish that is. I know I would eventually lose that pay check & the crappy HMO, my apartment soon after, and a whole cascade of basically everything if I couldn't get this under control. 

So far, I've been much more physically miserable other times I've dealt with coming off of alcohol like this. So unless something new and concerning pops up, I'm going to stop tearing myself apart about not seeking medical assistance this weekend (and/or kicking myself for not doing it sooner). I am going to make it a point to follow up with the regular healthcare I've been ignoring for years. But that's a bigger collection of hurdles for another day. 

&#x200B;

I've done countless things to sabotage relationships, jobs, etc. due to alcohol - usually while acutely under the influence. I've been a shitty partner many, many days because I'm buzzed 2/3 of the time. But today, because my stomach had hit this brick wall and I then felt too sick to leave home, I missed spending time with someone I love at an event we were looking forward to and which will be the last of its kind for this season. They could have gone themselves, ended up kinda not feeling like it, and are only mildly disappointed and not angry at all. Still, this is what's getting me the most. I was shitty as a partner today because I was unable to follow through on plans. And if at least I had a buzz or some comfort I would be a bit numb to that. Or if it was something shitty that happened during my latest bender, I could regret but move on. But this is today and now and I'm in the middle of these feels.

They deserve better. They're understanding and supportive and bringing me an electrolyte-replenishing drink later so I can hopefully settle my stomach enough to get back on food sooner rather than later (can't even manage saltine crackers right now, will try tea or broth soon). But they seem to be losing hope that I can really quit. This person has suggested/asked multiple times in the past about pouring out booze, and even when I was working on day 1 out of the 30 days I achieved successfully, I've always said no. Today I offered, as kind of a joke bribe for bringing over the gatorade, thinking it would be met with enthusiasm (this is a first!). But the answer was ""what's the point?"" And that's true because a) I can easily get more delivered, usually within 2 hrs maybe a day and b) I've successfully left bottles sitting while choosing to stay sober for a set period of time - basically, if I decide I'm going to drink I am going to make it happen and if I have decided not to drink, I just don't touch it. But still, it was unexpected and made me realize they no longer have that hope and excitement that it'll stick this time. And I've had too many day 1s to blame them, obviously.

My rock bottom was reached last monday night, when I ended up in a psychiatric clinic after my then girlfriend had to pull me down from a window as I drunkenly told her I would jump. Prior to this moment she had just come home to found me bruised up in my face, barely being able to stand up. Apparantly I had hit myself in the face with a frying pan really hard a couple of times. I had also drunkely confessed to her about how I had hid bottles around our apartment, how I used to tell her I went for a jog when in fact I went to a pub to drink beer at nights, and how I drove to buy wine at lunch on workdays while working under the influence at home.

Needless to say, she found herself a new place to live that same night, came and picked up most of her things the day after. I fully understand her, and I don't blame her at all. I've been a horrible, lying piece of shit. So now I am here, in our (now mine) half-empty apartment, in a city we moved to together less than a year ago, knowing nobody at all around here. She doesn't want to talk to me anymore. The pandemic hasn't allowed me to meet the people I work with, and I have literally zero friends around me to help me cope with what I'm going through.

I dont know if it's the moon or some sort of unexplainable planet orientation, but these days/weeks have seemed rougher than normal. My friend, who often drinks 3+ glasses of wine on Friday/Saturday and is happy with life and has described feeling satisfied with her drinking habits, claims that life is all about allowing space for imperfection and moderation. She says that I often go to extremes, trying incredibly hard to not drink which makes me too restricted; then, I'll drink as I normally do (did?) on the weekends, and hate myself for not being perfect. 

I have difficulties with perfection; when I drink I know I'm not perfect and feel like I should be sober; when I don't drink, I recognize I'm not perfect and shouldn't be drinking but want to. 

It feels like either way I'm losing this game of feeling satisfied with my choices to drink or not. I'm proud of my 5 weeks of no drinking, know that I'll be proud of 6 weeks, and also recognize the grace I need to have for myself if I'm back to day 1. 

My brain seems confused and muddled all the time. Sobriety is causing me more stress now more than before. It's probably because sobriety seems like a choice still; the key is to trick yourself into thinking it isn't.",6,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.42392716}"

After 20+ years of close-to-heavy drinking, the pandemic really ramped things up and I was getting into a really bad place for the last year plus. I decided a month ago that I needed to stop when I realized that I'd been having 8-10 drinks a day, every day, for over a year. I was able to stop completely with not too much difficulty (I know, I'm lucky), and I'm now at the longest I've gone without drinking since around the year 2000. I was expecting to lose some weight cutting that many empty calories, and I haven't, but whatever. What I really think is weird is the other stuff:

* practically no energy when I try to work out
* much more frequent feelings of depression (I made a doctor's appointment for this but they were booked until mid-October)
* my vision in my right eye got *really* bad right when I stopped drinking and hasn't recovered
* frequent headaches (may be related to the vision thing though)
* on-and-off stomach bloating and indigestion

I googled ""alcohol withdrawal symptoms"" but these didn't really seem to come up much, especially not the vision thing. So, did anyone go through this kind of stuff when they stopped? And if so, how long did it take in your case to feel normal/better? I had been assuming that once I stopped drinking I would feel better, and lately I've been having some very unproductive thoughts along the lines of, ""if I had a drink maybe I'd start to feel better again."" I don't want to go that way, because every time I've tried to moderate my drinking in the past I eventually slid back to heavy drinking.

My parents are visiting for this long weekend..they are the primary reason why I got help for drinking (even though a lot of my drinking has stemmed from pressure/expectations/stress that they placed on me growing up). 

Anyways, we were eating brunch this morning when my dad brought up my sobriety and what I‚Äôm doing for it (I have a job mandated weekly group substance abuse meeting that I am now required to attend). I didn‚Äôt want to talk about sobriety. I‚Äôm honestly just quite sick of constantly thinking and talking about it. I told them straight up that I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it with them-I also mentioned that I did not believe I had a unique problem that my siblings did not have, and it‚Äôs due to my personal situation and life circumstances.

Anyways; we ended up fighting, my mom ended up crying and I left the argument before it got worse. I just couldn‚Äôt take it. I honestly don‚Äôt think I want to ever talk about this shit with them again. Because of them, I drank to numb the pressure and pain of my life; because of them, I had to stop drinking around people because I had ‚Äúa problem‚Äù, so my drinking was isolated and alone in excess; because of them, I had to tell my boss that I had a problem because they threatened to tell him if I didn‚Äôt (seriously, this shit pissed me off immensely).

The results came in for my second LFT. First test was 1 1/2 months ago, a lot of the numbers have since changed. I was not on any medication (diuretics) for the first one, and I also had to fast for the first one as there was a lipid test involved too. 

Since taking the second test I've often been feeling dehydrated due to the meds, and I've significantly upped my protein intake to prevent the muscle wasting that I've been having by adding 2 whey protein shakes to my diet (in fact I had one for breakfast, and the second one about an hour before the test). 

The good news is my Bilirubin has dropped quite a bit, I would think that means my liver is healing.  

First Test - Second Test

SODIUM - 136 NORMAL- > 133 (LOW)  
CHLORIDE - 101 NORMAL -> 98 (LOW)  
BUN - 6.9 (LOW) -> 23.7 (HIGH)

GFR - "">90"" (NORMAL) -> 70 (NORMAL)  
PROTEIN - 7.8 (NORMAL) -> 8.4 (HIGH by 0.1)   
BILIRUBIN - 3.25 (HIGH) - > 2.41 (HIGH)

I'm happy the Bilirubin has come down so much, I've noticed my urine is not as dark anymore!

ALT - 26 (NORMAL) -> 39 (NORMAL)   
AST - 50 (HIGH) -> 61 (HIGH)

I know this isn't a ""birthday"" or a real mile marker or anything, but just sort of wanted to reflect... hopefully this is enjoyable to read, if not... feel free to disengage... you've been warned... haha...

To be honest with you all, I haven't been this sober since I was I teenager... I was 17 years old when I started drinking... there was a girl I liked, who DEFINITELY did not like me back... In her defense, I was a teenage boy going through puberty... I was VERY awkwardly tall, and heavy set... I must of just looked liked this giant grease monster coming towards her... But she had a party, and she invited me... and I'll never forget how that felt...

I'll never forget how, after spending an entire childhood fantasizing about just fitting in... here I was... drinking white wine out of a plastic gas station big gulp cup, surrounded by pretty girls, while making ""plans"" with the cool dudes from around town that I'd seen in bands...

I'll never forget how, on an old, red, corduroy couch in a (retrospectively) VERY disassociated suburban parent's playroom attic... I felt ""cool""... I felt seen...

Now obviously, my emotional needs have changed since then.. but at that age... at that time in my life... that's all I wanted... needed... I felt happy... I felt comfortable in my own skin, and felt like the world had finally opened up. I had not only arrived, but I suddenly belonged... I just remember thinking, ""I like this...!"" haha... even the hangover the next morning, the wreaking of cigarettes... it all just seemed to fit... It was an exciting part of the journey. I felt like I was living...

It's funny too... how, (if any of you are familiar with the 90s cartoon Rugrats). most of us that end up here... forums like this, subreddits like this, AA even, or worse, (like in my case) which is now a sober living after my first stint in rehab... were usually the Chuckie Finster of the group... (that's a callback to my way too long winded analogy...haha.) Basically we were the nerds, the late bloomers, NOT the kid stealing the liquor from our parent's liquor cabinet. But boy, oh boy... we sure made up for lost time....

75 days you all... I sometimes get scared still, I start thinking about just the scheer unpredictability of my own self... my own capacity to stay engaged, diligent, tenacious... because I'd be lying if the marketing of alcohol still doesn't work like a fucking charm on me... and endurance was NEVER my strong suit... Ask any gym teacher or sports coach I've ever had... but it's scary... FOREVER is a very long time...

and to be really honest you guys, sometimes this sobriety shit, this AA shit, this whatever you wanna call it shit... is EXHAUSTING.... the check ins, the mantras, the HOW ARE YOU DOING, HOW ARE YOU FEELING... WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT TODAY... it's exhausting... it's necessary, and I get it... but also don't they know I've only got so many profound and/or quippy ways to say, ""I don't know man, I'm just. fucking. trying...""

but... I'd also be lying if I didn't say it's absolutely worth it...  getting clean has single handedly given me everything I hoped the buzz of alcohol would... the world has opened up to me again, like it did for that same awkward teenage boy... the perspective shift alone is worth it y'all... and that's why im writing this here today... because even though I do believe it... I needed to remind myself because above all else... again... this shit is exhausting, haha...

But what's more exhausting is knowing that, in a heartbeat, I could very easily, once again subscribe to what people on other, more dire subreddits I follow are going through... which is essentially just a million variations of throwing their hands up and saying ""fuck it""...

Some of my other colleagues were off on Friday (making their Labor Day long weekend extra-long), so we had a small party for her near the end of the workday on Thursday. It wasn't mentioned ahead of time, but when we gathered for food and chit-chat and goodbye speeches, there were three bottles of wine (we're not a big department; there were ten of us present). In the past, I would've gotten a little rush of excitement that I was going to be able to drink, maybe a little bit of nervousness about having to be careful not to overdo it in front of coworkers. This time, though, my reaction was totally different; it felt like I was suddenly confronted with *danger*. I got a little dizzy, my heart suddenly started pounding, my breathing got faster, and my hands went tingly. I felt threatened. 

I didn't want to make a misstep and give up my 2+ months of sobriety. So in my panic, I turned to the person who was standing closest to me...which happened to be my manager. We were hanging back a little bit from the rest of the group, so I turned to him and quietly said, ""[Boss's name], I need to tell someone...I'm a recovering alcoholic, so this is making me pretty uncomfortable. I just want somoene to know so that I won't be tempted to crack..."" He just nodded and asked, ""So do you want me to keep an eye on you?"" I told him I probably didn't really need that; once someone else is aware that I cannot drink, the notion usually leaves my mind. Finally, I started to relax a little (once the adrenaline stopped pumping), so I got some cheese and crackers and a small piece of cake and chatted with a couple of my colleagues. Then I remembered that I had a bottle of Perrier in the fridge. That Perrier actually felt a lot more satisfying than the wine would have been! 

When all was said and done, I sort of wished that it had been one of my other coworkers that I had told (I've gotten pretty friendly with the woman who sits across the aisle from me, enough that we sometimes share somewhat personal stuff), but nothing terrible happened. My boss asked me later over Teams (the messaging app that we use in my office) if I was doing okay; I said ""yes, thank you,"" and that was it. Friday, he didn't treat me any differently than before I told him my secret. I think I would have stayed sober even if I kept my panic to myself, but telling someone made it easier and helped me relax and enjoy the moment, instead of white-knuckling through it. I learned a few things from this experience, but these are the biggest:

1) My commitment to sobriety is much stronger than it used to be. In the past, shame or pride would have kept me from admitting my problem to someone like my boss, but this time, I was eager to do whatever I could to protect my sobriety.

2) It isn't true that the whole world is going to despise me if they know about my struggles with alcohol. More people have respect for those of us in recovery than we might think.

After graduation, maybe once a week. I was a binge drinker; didn't see a point to drinking if I didn't get the effects. Later, I lived in South Korea for four years (2008-2012). It's a drinking culture there, available 24/7, and I took public transportation everywhere, so there were no societal limits. Somewhere between then and now I started binging almost every night. Alcohol was a constant companion. Off work, home, black-out drunk, repeat. I always knew I'd have to stop sometime, and age 40 loomed in my head. That day was July 4, 2021. Everyone decided they wanted to go to the beach for a traditional holiday weekend of drinking and partying and I went along. I felt angry and disappointed with myself, but I still drank, almost out of defiance and frustration.

I skipped the Labor Day weekend celebration with the same friends, and stayed home instead. I found this subreddit yesterday. I didn't drink yesterday. I am not going to drink today. When I'm sober, I feel safer, in control, aware. And I have enough time to do EVERYTHING, lol. And even if I don't do anything, as long as I don't drink, I still feel like I accomplished something. I can trust myself if I'm sober. I can trust my body and know that I'm protecting myself if there is no alcohol inside of me. I just really want sobriety to stick. Alcohol is so accepted and ubiquitous in our culture that it's a constant, daily choice we have to make. That kinda sucks.

* Morning meditation
* Green tea (no coffee)

Party last night was great. Difference for me was that I wasn't drinking. Didn't bother me and I didn't even had urge to drink. I had a fleeting thought on some wine but then drank water.  Still had great time and lots of chats. 

As evening progressed I noticed a difference.  People got drunker and then the conversations lost greatness.  Two left for a bit to get to their house nearby for more beer.  This was just alcohol dictating.  It would have been me last year.  I then bowed out and went to sleep.  Woke up in middle of night hearing someone throw up in bathroom.  I am now awake in the morning. Rested and feeling great.  Looking forward to a good day.  Maybe hiking.  The rest of the group is still asleep and will be useless until afternoon.  

I am feeling great and happy that I didn't drink and still had fun last night.  Having fun at party is about me and no need to have alcohol.

Very first thought was going for a drive to get a bottle of wine. Anything that would ‚Äòmake me feel better‚Äô. Phoned a friend, worked through the emotions until I calmed a bit and was in control again. 

I thought about tomorrow and waking up immediately with that all too familiar first thought of what did I do, did I drink, how much did I drink? How hungover am I? ... and I know that I‚Äôll be able to answer that voice by saying ‚Äònope you‚Äôre good, you‚Äôre in control today‚Äô

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/), we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at [r/stopdrinking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/) or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

* The stuff tastes foul.  Yes, drinking for taste isn't the point, but my god it is truly awful.  I really used waste lots of money to buy alcohol that promised to taste less bad than cheaper alternatives.  Sorry, but it is all bad.
* The effects aren't that great.  I might have had a little boost of energy and joy, but that lasted a very short amount of time.  I just became stupid before ultimately passing out.
* Hangovers are worse than I remember.  A day that began with vomiting and carried on with anxiety, dizziness and headaches is not a good day.  Did I really used to put up with this on a daily basis?

It‚Äôs nice seeing the support between peers, and the advice that‚Äôs helped so many. I guess I‚Äôm posting looking for advice also. I‚Äôm not a great communicator so I‚Äôll do my best to get my point across without rambling. 

I‚Äôve been lurking the category for about 4 months, but I haven‚Äôt really found a situation close enough to mine to draw a comparison. 

Quick background, I‚Äôm 31, been drinking since 20, probably a little more frequent than I should have been, but not large quantities. The last few years it‚Äôs become every night. Still not a crazy quantity. 1-2 mixed drinks on the weekdays, 3-4 each day Friday- Sunday. 

I don‚Äôt get sick, it‚Äôs never affected work, I have talked to my wife about it who says she has no problem with my drinking and doesn‚Äôt feel I have a problem. But I wanted to take a break from it to curb the habit of drinking every night. So I stopped drinking with the intention of just taking a break and drinking again socially down the road. That was 8 weeks ago today. The first few days were strange, just because I was in the habit of mixing a drink when I got home from work, and now I just got water. But the habit broke pretty quickly and I haven‚Äôt really had a craving for alcohol since I stopped. 

I decided from the beginning I‚Äôd probably start drinking again on my 5 year wedding anniversary. We had plans to go to a very nice restaurant that we wouldn‚Äôt normally go to based on our income. That was 2 weeks ago. When it came time to order I actually felt a little scared to order alcohol, I don‚Äôt think I have a problem but I also wasn‚Äôt happy with how often I was drinking. So I just got a coke and was perfectly content. Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I should just quit for good since I haven‚Äôt felt the need to pick it up again.

I just need an outlet to vent how I've been feeling in hopes that others can relate to my situation. This seemed like a really good community to vent in, but I apologize if I am getting annoying.

6 days since I quit binge drinking. I have 0 desire to drink still. I have been dealing with body aches and pains since my last binge. At first I thought it was pancreas and kidney related, but I'm coming to realize it probably isn't. I know I keep putting off the doctor, but I wanted to wait until the holiday (labour day) had passed until I go in and get checked out. I don't think my aches are due to organ damage now.
I have been feeling sensations in my body (notablebly ankles, knees, thighs, hips, and lower back) where it feels as though the areas are swollen, but visually they are not. I imagine this is the sort of pain arthritis patients would feel. I've dealt with this even prior to my latest binge, but for whatever reason, the aches are worse now. I hope that by quitting drinking, inflammation in my body will be reduced and I can go on with life without weird aches. I am only 23 but I feel like a 70 year old arthritis patient. I've been taking it easy, drinking lots of water, eating more healthy and trying to take care of myself as I never ever want to feel the way I did this entire week.
Thanks for listening to me.

I got angry and yelled at my spouse so much that my throat has hurt for the past two days. I totally lost it. My life is like a pressure cooker. I‚Äôve been with my family 24/7 for a year and a half taking care of the needs of 3 and now (as of last fall) 4 people every single day with never a break. It‚Äôs an impossible situation. I did a year of virtual kindergarten. I‚Äôve come to realize my spouse is a high conflict personality and I‚Äôm blamed for everything no matter what. My life has turned into this hell I‚Äôm living every single day. With Covid, everything has also been isolated so I never get a break and I never see or talk to anyone other than my own family. I‚Äôve never felt so isolated.

Right before the pandemic and initial lockdown a year and a half ago, I was already drinking somewhat to relieve stress, like a cocktail around cocktail hour and it would just loosen me up a little and I wouldn‚Äôt stress so much over everything and then every single thing in my life got progressively worse and harder throughout the pandemic and I realized I was drinking pretty much every day just to get some sort of relief from all the stress I am continually under. 

Problem is when I drink too much or just have one or two drinks but drink really quickly I have this tendency to lose it if I‚Äôm provoked in the slightest and it‚Äôs not good. I get really upset and it‚Äôs the tipping point which makes it go from something that relaxed me to something that is now creating a huge problem for me.

So I‚Äôm trying very hard to quit now. I‚Äôm only on day two of not drinking. It‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve done so much for so long that I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm going to do this. When I drink it‚Äôs extremely hard for me to have just one at this point.

No one really knew how much I drank. Things changed at the beginning of 2020, I came down with a weird lung issue that multiple doctors and hospital stays couldn‚Äôt figure out. It caused me so much anxiety that I started drinking during the day. I ended up needing it just to function with my business, I own an internet business that requires me to answer the phone, place orders, answer online chat, and deal with issues. 

My husband mentioned to me twice that he was concerned about my drinking. I told him each time I would cut back, and I did try. I had no clue how concerned he was. He ended up confiding in my parents, who freaked and brought in an interventionist, and then they brought in my brothers in sister in law. 

They surprised me with an intervention. That was the worst thing they could do to me. I‚Äôm a very private person and not very close to my parents as my dad abused me growing up. I don‚Äôt have much of a relationship with 2 of my brothers. So them being brought into the most personal part of my life was horrifying. I agreed to go to rehab for my husband but I was beyond pissed and resentful. 

I hated the rehab, all the rules, couldn‚Äôt make one phone call for 2 weeks, I couldn‚Äôt keep any of my books etc. I was angry and bitter to put it lightly. So I came out of rehab at the beginning of this year and went straight back to drinking. My relationship with my parents and brothers were pretty much broken. There‚Äôs a lot of back story there.

Fast forward to this summer. I start drinking more and more and switch from beer to airplane vodka bottles as they are easier to hide. 

After 2 months, I realized my body was seriously addicted. I wake up at 3am or 5am with extreme shakes, chills, and sweats. 

I could not believe I was that bad so quickly. I had a change of heart and decided I‚Äôm sooooo done with alcohol. The difference this time is that it‚Äôs my decision. The problem though, I‚Äôm physically addicted and can‚Äôt stop. I feel like I have the flu and can‚Äôt get out of bed unless I have some alcohol. I don‚Äôt even get buzzed now, I drink just to feel normal. 

I‚Äôm so mad and angry at myself. I wish I could stop today, but if I do I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be in big trouble. I also have twin toddlers and a business to run. I can‚Äôt just lay in bed for a week. 

My husband left on a 10 day trip he had planned all year with a buddy. I broke down and told him the night before he left. I was so sick of the lying and hiding. I‚Äôm so sick of alcohol, I hate it now. 

We cried and he was appreciative of me being honest. I told him I would work on tapering while he‚Äôs gone and if that doesn‚Äôt work I need to go to detox when he gets back. He was super supportive. I just feel so bad that I‚Äôve allowed myself to get to this point and hide all this from him.

Today I started my taper, I was in withdrawal with flu like symptoms until I had a vodka bottle. I‚Äôm trying to taper with beer. Vodka is the demon, I‚Äôve never been physically addicted until I introduced that. I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here. I‚Äôm just going to take enough to calm the chills and shakes and I‚Äôm writing down my consumption and times I drink. My goal is to just use beer and taper from there, but it seems light beer is not enough. 

I just want to be so done with this. I can‚Äôt believe I dug this hole for myself. 

Anyways, I‚Äôll keep updating with my progress. Oh I forgot to mention, last weekend before I told my husband I drove to the hospital to detox. My kids were at their grandparents for the weekend and my husband was at work. I stood there waiting for 10 minutes and got scared and left when no one came to the desk.

Before I started my career

Before I owned a home

Before I met what I hoped to be a lifetime partner

Before I had children

Before I became the person that the main character talks about at the end of the movie *Trainspotting*.

Somehow I would magically figure everything out as soon as any of *that* happened. Besides, I'm in my 20s, wasn't it my right to act and feel this way? Weren't we the only ones that enjoyed our partying?

What I wish that I knew is how addictive alcohol can become based on repeated exposure to it and how the habit would become stronger and stronger, at least with me, when my responsibilities in life did the same. Nothing highlighted this more for me than the pandemic when my habit slowly consumed me, but there is no doubt that as my life kept changing in major and somewhat predictable ways, throwing new circumstances and added responsibilities every 4-5 years, so did my problematic drinking.

So if you are out of college and already drinking hard in your 20s the odds really are that you'll be drinking even harder in your 30s and maybe even harder than that in your 40s. I wish I had known that this would be true for me then rather than relying on the magical thinking that ""a job, home, wife, kids"" and so on would somehow make me immune on day to the addictive qualities of regularly consuming alcohol. 

Don't get me wrong, I am grateful and even ecstatic that I have come to this realization now rather than a decade from now. And that I am not drinking with you today.",19,"{'pandemic': 1, 'immun': 1}","{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.40504083}"

So I nearly wasn't going to post for day 69 because cringe, right? But hey, every day sober is worth celebrating, this one is just a little extra spicy!


Usual story, drank for ages on and off. I'm 48, probably been drunk more days of my life than I have sober. Got real bad towards the end 69 days ago - the couple of weeks before I quit (alright, month and a half) I was spending about $250 per week on alcohol, buying cheap vodka, going through around 1lt per day, drinking when I woke up, at work, on the drive home, etc. We habitually keep a couple of bottles of chilled water in the fridge that only I use for cordial, I'd come home on a Friday evening and when my partner wasn't around I'd swap them for 50/50 water and vodka, that way I could present as only drinking cordial on the weekends before midday but secretly I was getting my fix in. 


On the day I quit I woke up with trembling that I couldn't control and it rather scared me. On the advice of other posts here I read Allen Carr's book Stop Drinking Now. I read it all throughout that day and it completely changed how I think about alcohol. I haven't had a drop since.



I'm not going to say it was easy, because it wasn't. Chocolate helped! But it gets easier. I think about alcohol less and less each day. 


The word i now associate most with sobriety when I think about it is freedom. Freedom from passing out most nights. Freedom from poverty. Freedom from forgetting whatever happened the evening before. It's amazing.

I recently passed the 6 month marks couple of weeks ago. My birthday is today and was rather unremarkable. I wasn't kind of bumming arounf because I had therapy this morning, a haircut, and only a handful of people wished me a happy birthday. It makes me feels lonely. I don't want to sound like I am hitching, but even before my bday, I have been frustrated with things and it got bad with the 6 month mark.

I feel like by now, I should have something to show for this period of not drinking. I know soberity isn't a magical cure all but it's frustrating. I am therapy, actively trying to treat my generalized anxiety disorder that sent my anxiety over the edge last year with covid and drinking. I should have more to show for it by now.

I mostly keep to myself these days. Work, exercise, trying to eat somewhat healthy (even though I have been bad lately). Haven't touched anything since February. I miss people and being social. Covid has a lot to do with it because I am isolated a lot. I miss when things seem rosey and manageable. I hate feeling like this all the time.

I still continue with therapy, figuring out what meds work, etc, but I just feel miserable in the meantime. My 6 month anniversary was somber. My bday just adds to it.

Sorry for the depressing rant. I just thought I would have this soberity thing figured out by now.

BUT as a sat there and agonized over it, I realized that I am really really proud of the fact that I don't drink. Ever. It makes me feel good about myself. It's something that has become a part of my identity in a way. Not all of who I am, but part of who I am. I don't drink. So after what felt like forever of agonizing about it, Dream Me said no to the drink and immediately felt relieved. Super proud of Dream Me and hoping that Awake Me will make the same decisions if and when that conversation or a similar one happens. Go Dream and Awake Me!

It's easy fun and the euphoria of getting messed-up and/or finding alternative consciousnesses is human nature. Addiction is nature. I quit when I was 29 but I had the awareness of my alcoholic tendencies (hereditary) in my early 20's. I finally quit because it got to a point where life sucked because I was so unhealthy.

When I quit, I didn't know it would be forever. I just wanted to feel better. I was also about to finish college and become a teacher. I had about one year left when I quit. So, that was motivation and a distraction that helped in the beginning. I was going through withdrawals the first few weeks of the semester. But I was walking a lot because I parked off campus, which I think those walks helped push my health initiative.

But I took things slow. I didn't worry about to many other things. Just one day at a time. Try to get as much sleep as I could, withdrawals made that tough for awhile, but I got stronger each day and after a coupe months I could feel some real affects happening. It's been 4 years now. Life is crazy in different ways now, but it's just as amazing without alcohol. And alcohol was really my only problem, that and cigarettes, but smokes were tied to drinking. I use cannabis just fine and it enhances my life in a similar way as does coffee. The reason I mention the cannabis is because in earlier attempts, or my hard times when I wished I didn't drink, I used to be more hard-headed about doing everything all at once. Like I had to quit everything because I can't handle this one thing. Like I had to fix all my problems at once. Now, I didn't start using cannabis regularly until I had 6-7 months. And there's been times where I stopped smoking, or drinking coffee, because I'm stressed about things and I have anxiety. Those things can cause anxiety too. My point is, I think it's better to have a calmer approach because things take time to change. It takes a lot of love and patience too.

Some stories say werewolves black out or have hazy memories of their transformation. I have transformed too many times to count.

I started a little early, bc I drank almost all the liquor on August 30th, and slept the next day right when I got off work. 5 days and there is still some tequila calling to me. Probably the longest any liquor has stayed in a bottle near me for a long time. Any dry spell required a dry house.

I set today aside to clean my room up and organize since it is a disgusting cluttered lair of depression....but that bottle keeps saying,"" you clean better when drinking. Like a machine! You wake up a little bad but, you didn't even remember how you did all that!"" 

But that's the issue. I lack impulse control. If I drink what's in that small bottle...it's going to poke the hungry beast clawing inside me. I'll go get another bottle and I'll transform into that horrid wretched thing by sundown that should never exist. The thing my boyfriend hates. The thing that will rip us apart like it has torn through so much of my past. 

It feels so angry. ""Why are you starving me? Just a small bit and we can coexist?"" I can feel it clawing bc the panic I feel in my chest and the metallic taste in my mouth. How does it break through the chains...every...single... time?

When I finally achieve control, I have decided to take the money I've saved from this poison and get a tattoo of a werewolf of my back/shoulder. One that has already broken one chain on its arm, ready at any moment to tear through me again. A reminder of how one night, one drink, has the potential to weaken that other chain just enough to start another drunken rampage.

I made the decision recently to stop drinking and smoking.  
I noticed in the recent months a real decline in my every day life...I don't really have health issues YET, but it's only recently that I noticed how much I've been drinking every week at home.  
I would usually have a couple pack of beers during the week and a bottle of liquor in the week end, which, needless to say, it way to much.  


I haven't been drinking that much all my life (I'm 30 btw) but I've always been drinking constantly since about 10 years. The consistency of my drinking didn't change that much but the quantity definitely has.  
It doesn't help that my body having adapted to increasingly higher level of alcohol, I always need more to feel the effects and never know when to stop anymore (I often would feel fine and keep drinking and in the end, not even remember when I went to bed the next day).  


So yeah, all of that to say that I decided to stop.  


The only thing I'm wondering is how should I go about it? Should I just completely stop or would it be better to learn to control myself and stop progressively?  
What have been your experience?  


Also, I just quit cigarette 2 weeks ago. Went from a pack a day to 0 cigarette. Currently suffering from withdrawal side effects which mostly affects me in the form of extreme anxiety and panic attacks (I went to the ER yesterday because of that, and that was the doctor's conclusion as well as they didn't find anything wrong in my tests).  


So is it a good idea to add the stress of quitting alcohol on top of those side effects from cigarette withdrawal or should I take it easy for now and maybe control my alcohol intake and reduce progressively?

I just closed the door on 115 days of not drinking.  

I found the following to be most useful .

The first few days of being a terrifying pisshead are dark but you have to white knuckle it until you achieve a level of stability.  If you can't do that - then hit programs etc.

Once beyond the DT's:

1.  Live your life not trying NOT to drink.  Re-acquaint yourself with the amazing person you were before your default free time position was 'have a drink'.  For me, this has been picking up music and French again.

2.  Being physically busy - exercise goals each day / week you have to reach.

3.  Having goals incongruous to boozing:   For example, I am working on having a 6 pack of abs by November.

4.  Daily gratitude journal - it works

5.  I know it's hard. Just take it 10 mins by 10 mins.  Before you know it you are 30 - 60  - 90 - 120z

6.  Buy some supermarket face masks to wear before bed.

7.  Love yourself and write about it in the morning.

8.   Tell yourself, it's not forever, you're just not drinking every day.  

9. Buy a bicycle - ride 16 - 20 k a day.  It takes a lot of effort to do this and can be done while withdrawing PLUS gives endorphins.

I used to gamble a bit too much, as well as use drugs but those days are long done. I think these were all simply ways of numbing myself and not confronting how I felt inside: sad, alone, scared, anxious, depressed, etc. These all gave me a temporary rise in mood, but it wasn't real. And, it always comes crashing down eventually. I'm not trying to turn this into a pity party, I am really not. I was unfortunate to have been a victim of CSA as a preteen boy, by 2 unrelated offenders and I never disclosed these things to my parents. I only told a few friends in my 20s and a therapist at age 30.  I guess a small child forms defenses in order to survive and deal with something so confusing and painful. Not a surprise that I developed mental health issues as an adult and became a recluse. Drinking eventually became my drug of choice. As a teen, 3 beers would make me ill. In my 30s I could drink 25 beers without an issue. The weekend binges just kept getting more and more intense. There was never enough beer for me to be happy. Inevitably, it started affecting my relationships and ability to deal with people. I sunk further and further into seclusion and deeper and deeper into my own head.

I‚Äôd mentally clocked the two places to get coffee the night before: the coffee shop on the corner, which opens at 7, and the 24-hour bodega on the corner a block away. So I was prepared. 

I woke up at 6 so the first place was out. I put on my shoes and as I walked out the door I thought about how lucky I was: this move was overall a heartbreak BUT I‚Äôd moved to a neighborhood with a 24-hr bodega a block away, where the closest one in the last neighborhood was a 15-minute walk away. Also‚ÄîI live in NYC: home of the great bodega that always has pretty good coffee. Most don‚Äôt let their coffee burn on the hot plate, most will make you a fresh pot if you come in mid-day and they have none. I‚Äôll never forget how bad the coffee can be in places with no bodegas, or places with an extremely low bar for bodega (or equivalent) coffee. 

Anyway. It was a gorgeous morning‚Äînot too hot or humid yet, a little breeze, no clouds. Walking up to my new bodega, I noticed a running car parked in front, right on the corner in the intersection. Two people were inside: a man in the driver‚Äôs seat and a woman in the passenger seat. They were sharing a joint. There was a man on the sidewalk, leaning in to the passenger window, talking to them both. When I rounded the corner, I noticed a nearly empty 750 of Tito‚Äôs in his hand. 

I instantly felt the morning (the end of the night, really) he was probably having. I remember those nights that ended early in the morning so well. How I‚Äôd feel like I drank myself sober. How my head would be beginning to pound, but I‚Äôd still drink, I‚Äôd rationalize the amount I‚Äôd had, the time I had to be at work, how there was enough time still for a few hours of sleep. How, when I did lay down, I‚Äôd get the spins so badly that I‚Äôd wonder if I would vomit in my sleep. How thick and sweet my tongue and teeth would feel when I did wake up. 

I walked in and got my coffee. I looked outside and the man with the Tito‚Äôs was playing tag with the bodega owner‚Äôs little boy on the sidewalk. The owner was watching‚Äîamused, not super worried, but obviously keeping an eye. The woman from the passenger side stumbled in and bought a pack of cigarettes. $20. They were $1.15 when I started, $12 when I stopped. 

I don‚Äôt judge that man. He serves as a reminder of myself for me. Maybe that was a one-off for him, maybe he was grieving or celebrating. Maybe that‚Äôs every day and he‚Äôs fine with it, maybe that‚Äôs every day and he wants to stop. I don‚Äôt know and it‚Äôs not my business. What I will say is that I saw myself in him crystal clear. My first morning in my new home, in my new neighborhood, a place where I have never been drunk or hungover, I saw myself. I hope he‚Äôs ok. I haven‚Äôt seen him or the couple from the car again, but I think of them almost every day.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44090644}"

I have several personal revelations but the one that just came so clear to me, just ten minutes ago, is this:

***I HAD ALWAYS HATED THE PRE-BUZZ FEELING IN MY BODY AND BRAIN AFTER 1, 2, 3 BEERS.***

I hated the ‚Äòpre-buzz‚Äô after 3 lousy beers over a 90/120 minute span, always in a social setting. My brain kept saying ‚Äòwhat the fuck dude?!?! When the fuck are we getting bombed on the real shit?!?!‚Äô.

That pre-buzz was more like a small headache with a little dizziness thrown in. I hated that pre-buzz feeling and I always very firmly responded to that pre-buzz by quickly replacing it with getting bombed. 100% of the time.

Not only that ‚Ä¶ I fucking hated slow drinking for the first, second, and third beers/drinks (almost always beers) at social events! I hated the fake persona that I forced myself, which was politely sip at a beer for about an hour, so you don‚Äôt look like a drunk. Those first 1/2/3 beers were so fucking excruciating and fake.

The reason why this revelation hit me this morning is that we are going to an afternoon party where there will be plenty of free booze, and I remembered the last party this host threw, where in the beginning I played the polite drinker, slowly sipping beers, getting so frustrated that I couldn‚Äôt go balls to the wall with getting hammered. And actually, it did get to that point! But I had to wait about 2 excruciating hours.

This last party was in May and I remember the thoughts and feelings in my head like it was yesterday.

What a crazy fucking addiction! I literally was causing myself more grief and angst in those two hours because I wasn‚Äôt having the instant gratification of pouring liquor down my throat, not only that, like I said, the party did get to that point but for what purpose??? Nobody remembered anything during the liquor phase anyway, and myself, others, and the host needed the next 24 hours to sleep off legendary hangovers. What the fuck kind of lifestyle is that?

Saw some friends who I hadn't seen in many moons, and who I previously had some beef with during our drinking escapades. It was the first time in over a year that I had been there and the place was my old watering hole. I wasnt sure how I would feel because the last time I was there I was blacked out, All I can think about is man I am so glad I went! I am so glad I dont drink anymore! 

The experience at the bar was great sober! I ran into some people I had issues with and talked and reconciled things in a proper sober talk. I realized how the grudge I held in my mind just wasnt serious nor was it worth it. I feel like I faced my fears. I also learned that since I had been away from my drinking buddies for a year that their lives are falling apart and whether they contribute that to drinking or not I'm not sure but it definitely plays a role. 

It took me almost half a year to not want revenge for allowing things some of these guys said to slide. some deserve to get slapped... However it seems their lifestyle took care of the revenge aspect for me. One ""buddy"" started doing drugs and drinking more, his Gf left him and he looks terrible. Another guy had the same thing, lost a long term relationship and was complaining about that understandably. Talking about how he is tired of all the b.s. drugging and drinking. I heard through the grape vine about another friend I know who is in jail and also lost his wife or maybe GF of 17 years because of domestic violence and drinking. Then I hear another guy is in jail for a month because he was caught DUI but was on heroine. Mone of these people seemed to happy about life and were drunk and allowing it to show. The icing on the cake was that one of my childhood friends who completely betrayed me and made sure that I knew he hated my guts, showed his true colors to the other guys and it came close to blows over it. I'm so glad because for a long time I was trying to tell people he was no good.

 Wow is all I can keep thinking.... that was my life... all that stupid drama and man oh man everyone is going down hill. I pray and hope that they get out of that life. Glad to have my sobriety re affirmed.

Oddly enough, my last drink didn‚Äôt punctuate a bender (though there were many of those in that last year). It was one cocktail on Labor Day in 2018. An overpriced, underwhelming cocktail at a public venue. I was with my wife and daughter and when I finished my drink, I went on autopilot and headed back towards the bar.

My wife quickly reminded me that I was driving and in that moment, I realized that alcohol‚Äôs grip on me was terrifying. My mind kept telling me ‚Äúone more, it will be alright.‚Äù I went through a series of what ifs: what if I sneak a drink on the way to the bathroom? What if I ignore my wife‚Äôs reminder and just get a drink anyway? What if I get a drink when they go to the bathroom? 

The mental gymnastics I went through on that day were exhausting. I had been talking to my therapist about moderation and had noticed that I was terrible at limiting myself to two drinks. I didn‚Äôt just want one more drink on 9/3/18, I wanted to get drunk. Badly. 

Thus, I decided to take some time off from alcohol. Initially I set the goal at one year. I had been coached to keep it simple, one day at a time, one hour at a time, if that‚Äôs what it took. I strung together a week, then two weeks. Then a month. The momentum was exhilarating and I looked forward to each new milestone. 

I‚Äôd love to tell you all that my life turned around on a dime from that day forward, but that‚Äôs not how it happened. Life‚Äôs challenges kept coming and knocking me around. There were plenty of tears and many moments of despair. Yet through it all I discovered that I felt more confident facing life‚Äôs challenges without crippling hangovers. 

For years all I could envision was what I had to give up to stop drinking. I had never, ever considered what I might gain. Those gains have by far overshadowed what I have given up. Too many gains to list, actually, but one in particular has been startling: I have regained my sense of self, warts and all. I buried my true self under copious amounts of alcohol and rediscovering these parts of me has been euphoric and harrowing at the same time. Yet it is me, not alcohol.  And for that I am grateful. 

Gratitude has been an overwhelmingly strong emotion to contend with these days. I am forever grateful for the individuals in r/StopDrinking who generously share their stories. The support of this community is amazing and truly one of the pillars of my sobriety. Thank you to all who care enough about each other to keep it so darn positive here!!

Any advice?,"**TL;DR - Have been using alcohol as a crutch to socialize. Without it, I‚Äôm now isolating and afraid I‚Äôll relapse because of it.**

So, this is my third major attempt to quit. I won‚Äôt go into the details of everything bad that has happened to me over the past few months while intoxicated, but it hit a breaking point and I again recognized why I wanted to stop in the first place.

I‚Äôve run into a problem probably pretty common with most here, probably more significant in my case since I am still in college where binge drinking is glorified. The issue is friends. I used to go through the week looking forward only to the weekend to party and/or go out to the bars. Since I stopped, that stopped as well. 

The only problem is, I get flipped in the completely opposite direction. Instead of being insanely social, I isolate completely. I work from home (I come in one day a week) and take my classes from home. In the 33 days I have stopped drinking, I haven‚Äôt gone out much. I have been taking my dog out on longer walks with the increased free time I have now. 

But, I‚Äôm starting to feel the monotony. I‚Äôm starting to feel trapped. I have developed worsening social anxiety over the years. Alcohol was my answer to that. Without it, I feel a need to socialize with no underlying desire. To make matters worse, I moved cities about a month before I stopped drinking. So, now my entire circle, save for my roommate and best friend, has evaporated. I don‚Äôt get any social contact outside of the one day of the week I go into work.

It sounds sad, but I do get invited places. I just can‚Äôt overcome the anxiety to go. Add the fact that I know the people who invite me will want to drink, and it results in me just being holed up in my room again. I‚Äôm just afraid that things will swing back in the opposite direction again and I can‚Äôt afford that.

I‚Äôm at a turning point in my career and am about to be promoted above people much older than I. From all aspects other than social, I really feel like I‚Äôm at a high point. But, I miss being able to go out on the weekends and meet people with no fear. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.",5,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7937952}"

That one drink then turns into at least five and so the cycle continues. 

I hope everyone has a great Saturday and weekend.

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Well, that's it! I can't believe the week is up already, it has been incredible talking to you all. 

I want to leave you with some thoughts on ancillary benefits - the little things that happen when we stop drinking that we hadn't even considered. 

We all know about the big gains; better mental health, liver function, more money, less time pooping - but it's the little incidental things on the side that that bring me a whole lot of joy. The things that surprise me, that hadn't even crossed my mind. More room in the fridge. Less time spent taking out the recycling bin. Not having to plan my whole day around making sure I had 'enough' wine. 

A lovely side effect has just been time. Just having more time to do things, read books, fart about, spend time with my kids talking about Olivia Rodrigo or watching cartoons. Time to engage with their interests and not use the tv as a distraction while I go pour a glass and turn my mind off.

We've been watching a show called Steven Universe  - a smart and well crafted story full of joy and hope and acceptance and great songs. The last words of the series struck a chord with me and I keep them in my head whenever I'm going into a difficult situation, be it a social environment where I'm likely to be pressured to drink or a hard conversation at work.

If I'm walking down the street and get a whiff of stale cigarette smoke and liquor fumes wafting out of some dark watering hole the FOMO can be almost physically painful. This hasn't really been the case for me lately, which I'm really thankful for. My reasons for being sober are stronger than they have been in the past, but mainly it boils down to the fact that I no longer want to feel the way that ""drunk"" feels.

For years I only had one, maybe two drunk nights per year and they were always fun but well within control! I was an optimistic happy gal, always a little on the introverted side, but certainly content and confident about it. I always had a small handful of close friends that I would spend time with and looking back, albeit naive, I was quite happy.

About 4, maybe 5 now, years ago, I had a particularly bad break up. It was a long time coming too, but i was too invested to accept it. At the end I began drinking more and more, I dont really know why at first, I think I thought it would help me build up alcohol tolerance and be ""cooler"" if I could have one drink when out, and not actually get tipsy. Stupid reason, right? But I, and my now ex, an actual self proclaimed psychopath btw, thought it made sense. 

Anywho, once things started rapidly declining south drinking became a daily thing. Go to work, go home, get shit faced, go to bed, rinse, repeat. 

It was really bad at the end. 

I started thinking about suicide, more and more those thoughts would come. I felt I had nothing left to live for if I couldn't live with the one person I felt so incredibly attached to and yet driven so mad by... I... thought that non existence would be better than the existence I was in.

I had lost touch with most friends by that point, but I had once close friend, who I thought was close anyway, and I kept asking her to meet, hang out, talk to me... for weeks I think, months even. I dont know how long this went on, but I called, texted, tried bribing even to just please come hang out with me, i needed... someone... anyone. And she... never did.

Until one night, I got drunk off my ass, and I called her at some ungodly hour drunk, and asked her to come take me to a train station, because I wanted to die, but I didnt want to drive and hurt anyone else. She did come, but she didnt take me to the station, we drove around, smoked a few cigarettes, I cried like I've never cried before... mourning... myself... she didn't say much.

She called cops on me who proceeded to take me to emergency room, scared the ever living shit out of my poor parents, and... we never spoke again. I had nobody left I could openly talk to anymore. And I was left no more than a shell of my former self. In one night, everything changed.

That was... like I said something like 5ish years ago.

Wouldn't you know, I kept drinking though. I might skip a day every now and again, I may not get black out drunk or get even get sick, I wasn't ""that bad"" and I guess that's why I kept doing it.

Fast forward to today. I am with my current boyfriend of 3.5ish years, we've lived together for almost a year in a place so nice I never even imagined I'd find myself, yet... the depression from that night never really went away, only faded somewhat, and the drinking never really stopped. There were a couple of times I tried quitting. Went about 4 months last year! But again, picked it up and as we all know found out time and time again that moderation is not an option for people like me.

Yesterday I got so drunk... I got so god damn angry about something completely inconsequential, and took it out on my poor man. By the time he got home from work, I was passed out in this weird little nest i made and decided to nap in. He gave me a few hours before he got me into bed. I dont remember any of that. All i know is that i took a drunk angry nap in one room at 4pm and woke up in bed and it was 11pm and he wasnt there. 

I found him sleeping downstairs, he thought itd be best to give me space. I woke him up to go up to bed and sleep comfortably. I couldn't fall asleep for a few hours though so i...  came here.

I am sober now. And... yeah... I'm ready. This wont be easy but I'm gonna start here.

In 19 days, I will finally pass the number of days I had before my [first] relapse and catch that elusive 666 fully and completely sober days. *But let me back up for a minute.*

**Almost 9 years ago**, I got blacked out a friend‚Äôs wedding at her parents‚Äô home after hurricane sandy, got in a fight with my boyfriend during the three-hour car ride home and crawled into the backseat on the highway. I woke up to him sleeping on the couch downstairs (which had never happened before) not speaking to me. When he did finally speak to me he told me that I was horrible to him, apparently, and wouldn‚Äôt stop yelling at him, so he went downstairs to the couch. The next weekend, I had just started graduate school at the number one school for my career in the country. There was a huge conference in town, my grad school sponsored a room at the conference for students and alumni, including an open bar. I made friends with the bartender (you know, as we do) and got her to give me the opened wine at the end of the night so I could keep drinking. The last thing I remember is leaving the second bar and going to the club. I was hungover for days.
 
After those two back-to-back weekends, I told my boyfriend I would stop drinking. I also told my best friend I would stop drinking. She suggested moderation. I split the difference by taking a break for about six months and then starting a long journey of unsuccessfully moderating my drinking.

**8 years ago**, I wrote on this sub:

>Over the past 6 months I've realized that it is not normal to black out every time you drink. I think it may be time to try to get rid of booze for good, even though I don't know if I can. Has moderation ever worked for anyone you know who has a problem similar to mine? I still feel very attached to my former college lifestyle of drinking a lot and having a great time, does this ever go away?

**7 years ago**, I posted here that moderation was working for me. I still debate taking that post down.

**6 years ago**, spoiler alert: Moderation wasn‚Äôt working for me. It didn‚Äôt work for me. Though I don‚Äôt feel the guilt so strongly anymore, I do wish I could teleport back there and say ""Girl, trust your instincts. No. Moderation will not work for you."" 

**5 years ago**, I posted that I was afraid I was going to slip up again, but honestly, I already had mentally. Because I was still drinking‚Ä¶ a little bit more often than I was allowed to in my self-imposed ""moderation rules."" 

**I can‚Äôt do 4, 3, or 2 year posts because I wasn‚Äôt here**. I tried moderation for a long time, as you can clearly see by my sordid posting history. 

**March 2019**. (Read that again, 2019, not 2020. üòâ) 

I was on a work trip with two people I wasn‚Äôt super close with. Free drink tickets and a chartered bus and I got so blacked out that I don‚Äôt remember going into my room. I can‚Äôt be sure what exactly happened, but I woke up without my purse or phone in a city I had never been to before the day of my flight home. I think I fell. I guess I hope I fell. I found my glasses broken on the floor and my face was so puffy and sore from where I think the bottom rim slammed into my cheek ‚Äì I apparently fell face forward and didn‚Äôt catch myself, breaking my glasses and giving me a burgeoning black eye. I thankfully found my phone and purse downstairs with the front desk. I spent the rest of the day working closely with the CEO and hoping my black eye wouldn‚Äôt get too dark until I got home so I could make up a lie. Not only did I spend the whole day working with the CEO (unshowered, hungover, with a black eye), but we were also on the same flight and spent the time at the gate just talking about work while I tried not to throw up. You can imagine the intense shame, fear, guilt, disgust, embarrassment I felt. My 8 years ago boyfriend now husband was extremely supportive. I signed up for therapy and told my two closest friends everything that week.

But did I stop drinking then? No. Not yet. Notably, I drank an entire bottle of wine after I was already incredibly drunk at my sister-in-law‚Äôs 30th birthday that summer. I was too drunk to put my niece to bed even though she wanted me to read her a story. So no. I didn‚Äôt stop drinking in March 2019, but you know what I *did* do? **I went to therapy.** Every week. Even when I didn‚Äôt want to. Even when I was so depressed I could barely speak. I sometimes felt like there was a hole inside of me that could never be filled; that I was a broken person. And I told my therapist that, crying on her couch. 

And then, after thinking about doing it for months, but without putting any pressure on myself, I just‚Ä¶ stopped drinking. For real stopped drinking. [November 27, 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/k21623/one_year_sober_yes_i_can_honestly_truly_say/). And I haven‚Äôt had a drop since. There was no major event, not in the most immediate sense (though there had been 20 years of major events). I was at a work happy hour, drinking a beer, and I thought to myself this is so fucking dumb. You do not want to do this anymore. I went home that night after two beers that I didn‚Äôt even want and told my husband I was done. I didn‚Äôt know for how long, but I didn‚Äôt want to drink anymore.

And here I am. Not a drop of alcohol in almost 666 days. And really, I‚Äôve been using that line everyday since. I‚Äôm not drinking right now, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs forever, but I feel amazing and I don‚Äôt plan on ever starting again.

**How is life better? Let me count the ways‚Ä¶**

* When my antidepressants finally kicked in I realized I had never felt this good in my entire life. Ever. I think this might be how ""normal people"" feel. I am on an extremely low dose so it‚Äôs not like some drug induced euphoria. I just think I have probably been depressed and anxious my entire life and self-medicating with booze the entire time.
* I don‚Äôt mind waking up in the mornings, even if I stay up late. I even like it. Today, a friend asked me to go to the 7am gym class with her and I did. I had never been to CrossFit before, but it was really fun. She bought me a delicious coffee after from a local bakery. I felt happy and productive all day. I never would have been able to say yes to that if I were still drinking.
* My husband and I fight way less and our communication has gotten way better. I have more patience and empathy for him and other people in general. I am a very, very lucky lady. He also doesn‚Äôt drink, never has. His dad is in recovery. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs something for him to unpack with a therapist there if he ever feels the need to go, but he doesn‚Äôt seem to be bothered by it. Again, I know, I am lucky to have him. Without booze, I feel like I don‚Äôt take him for granted as much anymore.
* I fight with my dad a lot less. This was a really tough one. My dad and I have had a difficult and sometimes explosive relationship for decades. Being sober offered me the opportunity to work on myself in a deep way ‚Äì no binges to cope or bandaid over feelings. Nothing to take the edge off. Because I was sober, I was able to redefine my relationship with my dad and as a result I think everyone in my family is much happier. Including me, and I hope him.
* Every time I am visiting my brother, Aunt kaleidoscope-eyes gets to read the bedtime story to her niece. This kid is the love of my life. I am so grateful she was born and that I have a good relationship with my brother and his wife. It was touch and go there at times. I never plan to have kids of my own, so this is as close as I can get. I love her with every fiber of my being. I never want my niece to feel ashamed of me or worried about me and my behavior. I want to read the bedtime story for as long as she‚Äôll let me. I couldn‚Äôt do that if I were drinking. Not in the same way because who has the energy? I‚Äôd be back in the kitchen filling up my glass or too tired and distracted. 

Honestly, everything is better. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs real. It reminds me of when I finally got glasses in 8th grade. I couldn‚Äôt believe how much depth there were in trees; when you looked up from the ground, you could see the outlines and layers of all those leaves. Being sober is like that. Crisp. Bright. Fresh. Not every day is perfect, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade my sobriety for anything.

If I were to give you any advice, I guess it‚Äôs this:

* **Go to therapy if you can afford it.** And be honest with your therapist. It truly changed my life. I‚Äôm not currently in therapy, but I am on anti-depressants. I suppose those also changed my life. I have been drinking since I was 14. And I mean HARD binge drinking since 14. Like shitting in the shower, breaking my foot, getting my parents to pick my 23 year old ass up from a townie party, drunk driving, smashing bottles, binge drinking. I don‚Äôt think I ever learned how to cope with anxiety or depression in a way that was healthy until the past year. I am forever grateful I met my therapist. She is also in recovery. It was truly a transformative experience that I will be eternally grateful for. We used SMART recovery resources and some cognitive behavioral therapy techniques ‚Äì all of which resonated with me deeply. But it‚Äôs important to find something that fits well with you and your beliefs. 
* **Try not to be so hard on yourself.** It took me almost 9 years to finally stop for real. I have been trying to get sober since I was 25. I didn‚Äôt *actually* go fully alcohol free at 33. Don‚Äôt give up, stop drinking as soon as you‚Äôre able, even one extra day sober is worth it, and stay strong. But more than anything, be kind to yourself. Treat yourself with the same empathy and kindness as you would the person in your life you love the most. You deserve that type of care from yourself. 
* **My favorite sobriety book: The Sober Girl Society Handbook**. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Millie‚Äôs British accent and slang or what, but I fucking love this book. I‚Äôve read a bunch of AF lit, and I don‚Äôt think any of them hold a candle to Millie‚Äôs work.
* **Don‚Äôt focus on how long you won‚Äôt drink, just don‚Äôt do it.** I don‚Äôt think I had ever really internalized what ""one day at a time"" or ""I will not drink today"" meant until I finally stopped. I didn‚Äôt put any rules or limits on myself this time I just said, for now, I am done. And each day since, I have been done.
* **Tell others you can trust who love you and want you to be happy, like the wonderful people on the sub, or really anyone in your IRL life, when you‚Äôre feeling like you might drink**. Just hearing my husband say ""ok, but you‚Äôre *not* going to. You got this babe."" has gotten me through a sticky situation or tough day many a time. That said, it‚Äôs not really anyone‚Äôs business in my opinion, so I only share my deepest sobriety feelings, thoughts, and struggles with three people besides my therapist, and hearing them say they are proud of me is more meaningful than I ever thought it could be. I‚Äôll probably post it on IG when I hit 666 though hahaha. 
* **As for today? Don‚Äôt drink.** I have never regretted a single drink I *didn‚Äôt* take. That‚Äôs a fucking fact. It‚Äôs clich√©, but true. You can do it. You know why? Because I can do it. We can do it together.

So, that‚Äôs that. 19 more days. It feels kind of like that scene at the end of Fargo when Norm looks over to Margie and says ‚Äútwo more months‚Äù and she repeats ‚Äútwo more months‚Äù after all the horrible murder, death, violence, and a second place finish. Life has never been better and I look forward to the challenges and opportunities a sober life has in store. Clear eyes. Full hearts. 

Thank you all for reading!

Love,
KE

A little backstory for me I‚Äôve never been an everyday drinker but binge drinking on weekends has been a huge part of my social life since I was like 17 (25 now). I‚Äôve blacked out many times and while mostly it‚Äôs fine I just act silly or say dumb shit every 1 out of 100 or so blackouts I‚Äôll become a different person, get mad, start fights, be mean to people I care about, drive drunk (thankfully no hurting anyone or DUI) or do any number of shameful and embarrassing things. I don‚Äôt know what is different each of those times as compared to the others, it‚Äôs like Russian roulette that pops about once a year. After each of those experiences I have taken a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from drinking that usually lasts a couple weeks until the shame gradually wears away and I start back up again. Rinse and repeat that cycle for the last many years. 
     2 weeks ago was the extreme of all of those. I acted like a pig toward my best friend/roommates girlfriend (who I also consider a friend) and then lost my temper and really hurt myself. I punched through a window and cut through my hand very badly. I would‚Äôve bled out if the girl who I had treated so disgustingly just moments before hadn‚Äôt been there to save me and call an ambulance. I don‚Äôt remember anything of that night and came to the next morning in the hospital when they shot me up with fentanyl and I threw up all over myself. I immediately knew I‚Äôd totally fucked up this time which was confirmed some time later by a text from my friend detailing my actions and saying that they needed a good deal of time apart from me in order to process what happened. I‚Äôm mortified, full of shame and guilt and remorse and all of those other terrible emotions that go along with blacking out but magnified by 10thousand. In that moment I knew that I needed to stop drinking permanently or else I would hurt more people, including myself until I was completely alone or dead. It‚Äôs been 2 weeks since then and I‚Äôve not even thought about a drink. I know there will be harder tests to come and 2 weeks is nearly nothing in the grand scheme of things, but I don‚Äôt want to drink, so I won‚Äôt. 
     Fast forward to now and I‚Äôve been staying with my parents since that day and likely will for another month or so as I heal and give my roommate space. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able repair the friendship with him or his girlfriend, nor do I know if I even deserve to. I‚Äôm giving them space while I work on myself and hoping that they give me a second chance. I don‚Äôt know how I can possibly make it up to them considering what I did but that‚Äôs a post in itself. Time will tell. 
     I know through social media that they and some of our other mutual friends are getting together tonight for drinks. something that previously I would‚Äôve been involved in but for obvious reasons am not. The 2 people I directly hurt are the only ones who witnessed my despicable display but I‚Äôm sure the story has made its way through the rest of the group and I‚Äôd be unwelcome there anyway which is sad in its own way but nothing less than I deserve.
     All this to ask how you all deal with feeling like you are missing out when your friends go out drinking? I already have pretty bad fear of being left out and now the main source of social interaction that I have with my friends (if I have any left) is cut off. Lying in my bed with nothing to do imagining then all having a good time without me is driving me crazy. I of course want them to have fun but I just feel so lonely and sad. Especially thinking into the future that even if I can mend my relationships with them I will still have limited opportunity for social interaction with them. Any advice or experiences would be much appreciated.  Sorry for the wall of text.

Something hit me hard recently and I am looking for advice, or stories or something from the group.

I quit drinking about 4 years ago, after reading stories on this site for at least a year. I was easing into quitting, still thinking I could moderate when life happened. My wife, who was struggling much more than me was suddenly forced to quit to get into a mental health program. She quit for awhile and I quit for good. We never really talked about it with our kids, teenagers at the time. 

Now the kids are late teens/20s and my wife‚Äôs drinking is getting much worse and I don‚Äôt know where to begin. I should have worked this through with the kids earlier, but here we are.

So they don‚Äôt have the tools to work with an active alcoholic and although I have been reading through the al-anon site and trying to detach with love from my wife, but seeing them reacting to getting falling down drunk recently really hit me hard.

I fucked up and I need to work with them on whatever issues they have with me before (or in addition to) dealing with their mother.

So what do I do? AA? Counseling for me, them all of us? Al-Anon?

It was too easy to say nothing, but I can‚Äôt do that anymore. And I‚Äôm not sure where to turn.

It feels too late to start AA, and I don‚Äôt think I need it to stay sober, but it would give me a script to start on. I could make amends to my kids and start there, but it kind of feels like faking it. Also, I think AA is great for many, I just don‚Äôt see myself as a meeting guy. And the whole god thing.

Al-anon feels worse, especially if we haven‚Äôt dealt with me yet. 

Then there is counseling , one kid has gone a bit for anxiety, but I don‚Äôt really know where to begin there either.

At this moment, I attribute a lot of my feelings to being able to *actually feel* for the first time in years. Turns out when I buried my emotions in booze, the things that came out while drink were either not genuine or didn't work to actually release the underlying stuff. I have come to understand that the old ""in vino veritas"" thing is a lie for me. The true me is restrained and I hold back a lot because I need a high degree of trust to truly let go. When I'm drinking and I ""let go"" that's only a facade. The actual me is still cowering on the inside. Being uptight and private is who I am, and that's OKAY.

it started  years ago. at thirteen, i had my first drink. it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers. i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast. it fucked me up. i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good. after that, i stopped drinking for 2 years because i was scared of alcohol. i didnt want to get fucked up again. but at 15 i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and...needless to say, i went overboard and blacked out. i needed it to have fun. 

thats when it began. it started with just drinking with friends, then with the family, then on my own in my room. i drink about 3-5 shots of vodka 3-4 times a week. i even find myself thinking about drinking if i'm sad. i do it at night alone in my room...it helps me sleep. if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep.

you might be wondering---how can you afford all that booze?

well, my dad owns a bar in our backyard. i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka. my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice. i have a stash in my room. one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just...make a trip to the bar. 

its either big or go home when i drink. i dont have a limit. i'll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick. 

i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy (went a few years ago because of a family issue) but no diagnosis came out of that. but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety--i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious.

anyway, i wanna talk to someone about this. i dont see many teenager alcholics.

I rarely go out or spend physical time with friends, so it's rare for me to be around people who are drinking or talking about drinking. 

My boyfriend rarely drinks. It's maybe a once or twice a year thing and even then, he never gets really drunk or anything. He's the type to pour someone's drink down the sink if he thinks they've had too much. However, he has a friend who is obsessed with drinking and since we have a long weekend he agreed to drink with him. He told me he preferred to do it at our house, because frankly his friend's house is a mess and there isn't even furniture in the living room, it's just trash and boxes that haven't been dealt with since they moved in over a year ago. It's perfectly fair that he feels more comfortable at home.

I agreed and told my boyfriend it was fine if he had a friend over to drink, he's a grown adult and this is his house too, so why would I try and stop him? I'm actually happy that he's hanging out with a friend. 

They'll be in the living room, I plan on holing up in my boyfriend's room on his computer while they're here. However, I'm nervous. I haven't had a serious, unbearable craving in a long time and I worry that seeing people drinking and seeing strong alcohol in the house will be so distracting I won't be able to think about anything else. It just so happens to fall on a day where I'll be playing games with a friend until the early hours of the morning, but I'm still feeling a little anxious.

Any words of encouragement are appreciated. I just thought I'd vent since this is my first real challenge in a very long time. I'm so close to a full year, too.

BTW, my boyfriend knows about my journey and my sobriety, his friend does not. It isn't really something I'm comfortable talking about, especially since I'm young and no one believes young people who claim to be alcoholics anyway it seems... I'd rather not deal with someone trying to challenge me about something I consider such a sensitive topic.",7,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.44796878}"

( he was out or town for work)Then he had to get me a hotel room because I lost my keys.  the concierge had to tuck me in bed.
 I once attempted to walk home and managed to walk up a highway ramp. A stranger a fucking stranger! pulled over and took me  back to my friends. I could have been so easily hit by a car.
I've left my apt door open. Left keys in the door. 
I lost my phone keys and purse on new years, forgot leasing office wasn't open and had to sit outside my apartment for an hour freezing till a neighbor walked by and helped me call a locksmith. 
I can't count the number of times I've peed in beds and not just mine. 
Work is piling up because I'm always hungover .
 woke up in the morning in someones bed I can't even remember meeting because I was so trashed at least 50 times
Been kicked out of bars. Always losing my keys and I'd
Snort a lot drugs so I can drink more. 
Abuse my Adderall so I can function in the morning for work when hungover.
I'll say some pretty fucking mean shit and won't remember.
 
Once woke up at a strangers house, guy was going to brunch and I was going to call an uber he left as I was walking out. Turns out phone was dead and I had to walk two miles barefoot on the ridiculously hot sidewalk. I had blisters on the majority of the bottom of my feet and had to walk around on my knees at my apartment
My health is starting to decline...im always tired. The anxiety is crippling, I can't remember shit anymore

Sometimes I feel like even though I stopped drinking, I still define myself in relation to alcohol - but now its because I still think about it and miss it, or I get bummed I can‚Äôt drink it and others can, or I get nervous before social situations because drinks will be present etc. 

My question is, was there a moment or period of time when you realized you stopped thinking about alcohol? Stopped defining yourself in relation to *not* having it? 

I‚Äôm tired of still being somewhat obsessed with alcohol and it having power in my life. I wish I could just stop thinking about it and move on‚Ä¶ or is it naive to want that?

2021-09-03 13:41:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/pha1g2/35_years_sober_and_still_struggling_with_the/,3.5 years sober and still struggling with the friends vs. drinking buddies conundrum [long post],"Most of the people I was closest with prior to getting sober have in the years since shown themselves to be more in the latter camp. I‚Äôve tried but have been unable to let go of my resentment that they failed to ‚Äúshow up‚Äù for me in any meaningful way when I was in crisis.

These friends were my chosen family. I‚Äôm gay and for a long time the friendships I had with other gay guys were superficial and transactional, and led me to develop a deep distrust of other gay guys. A handful of years before I quit drinking, though, I finally found my tribe among a tight-knit group of 8 lovely guys. I know now that‚Äîwhile they may not be alcoholics like I am (it‚Äôs not my place to classify them)‚Äîalcohol was the bedrock of those friendships. Over the peak years of our friendship, the majority of the time we hung out was in gay bars for happy hour, but there were also countless game nights and trips to the movies, vacations, holidays together, and their weddings. To be sure, alcohol also figured prominently in those get togethers outside of the bars.

My getting sober came as a shock to them (and I imagine served as an unwelcome wake up call). I‚Äôm not sure if they picked up on how desperate I‚Äôd become toward the end. I was too ashamed when I was active to ever voice that I was struggling, and when I did tell them I‚Äôd reached a point where I needed to quit, one of ‚Äòem told me that I‚Äôd hid my problem really well and that they had no idea.

They‚Äôve always been supportive since I quit, but in a somewhat perfunctory way and there‚Äôs a palpable unease on their end whenever we hang out. They‚Äôve never once pushed drinks on me, but they also never really went out of their way to initiate get togethers or activities where booze wasn‚Äôt still a key component. When I was coming up on two years and was really struggling, I had a dinner with one of them that ended up serving as a kind of state-of-the-union for our friendship. He straight up admitted, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what our friendship is anymore,‚Äù and then allowed as how, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt always known how to be there for you.‚Äù I appreciated his candor, but it was as if he was looking for absolution for not having made more of an effort to be there for me (even when I‚Äôd been vocal about needing support), and was looking for me to let him off the hook of our friendship moving forward.

I hit two years right before Covid hit, and to be honest, the pandemic was a godsend for me socially. With nothing to do due to social distancing, there were no more game nights or dinner parties for me to go to and feel like an outcast. More than that, I‚Äôve admittedly felt considerable schadenfreude the last year and a half of quarantine life: these guys now know exactly how isolating it is to have to stop going out to bars so as to avoid coming into contact with something that could kill you.

I moved during the pandemic because I felt there wasn‚Äôt much left for me in my city, so I haven‚Äôt seen most of them since March 2020, though I‚Äôm still in touch occasionally with a few of the 8 guys. Only one of them showed himself to be the kind of friend you‚Äôd go into battle for, and I‚Äôm thankful every day to have him in my corner (and to be in his). The rest of the individual friendships have proven to be as superficial as my previous friendships with other gay guys were, and the feeling that I was hung out to dry by my chosen family has renewed and deepened my distrust of gay guys, sadly. 

Getting sober is the most important thing I‚Äôve ever done and I‚Äôm so fucking proud of myself. But losing these friends has been the biggest heartbreak of my life. A big part of me wants to let them know how much their inaction hurt me. I have a file saved on my desktop with a half-written letter to the guy who hurt me the most; I scrapped sending it, which is probably for the best. If I‚Äôm honest with myself, the idea of taking them to task directly for being negligent friends is more appealing than the idea of actually repairing the friendships, which I realize isn‚Äôt the most emotionally sober thing on my part. Mostly I just wanna be free of all my self pity around this situation and stop living in this cocoon of victimhood I‚Äôve built for myself around it.

I‚Äôve also been thinking lately about this through a lens informed by the social justice movement of the last year, and the imperative that folks who enjoy privilege (myself included) educate themselves about racism so that they can build their allyship muscle. I hope we see some of that spirit carry over into the conversation around addiction and recovery. In fairness to my friends, unless you‚Äôve dealt with a loved one embarking upon sobriety in the past, there‚Äôs not a lot in the public consciousness IMO insofar as a clear playbook for how to show up for a person who‚Äôs struggling. But early sobriety is hard enough as it is: in the same way that the onus shouldn‚Äôt be on someone who‚Äôs a BIPOC to teach others how to be an ally, a person who‚Äôs trying desperately to string together sober days shouldn‚Äôt also have to take on the emotional labor of educating others about how best to be a sober ally.

Has anyone on here had the pain of coming to terms with your friends having been little more than drinking buddies stretch, like, *years* into your sobriety? How did you ultimately address it?

**Also, for any newbies reading this, please don‚Äôt let my sob story dissuade you from sobriety. I know the fear of losing friends is such a big worry when first getting sober, and the thought of having to get distance from ‚Äúpeople, places, & things‚Äù for your own self-preservation is terrifying. But in spite of this hurt surrounding my own faded friendships, I have zero regrets around getting sober. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it to my mid-thirties had I stayed on that happy hour hamster wheel, and if losing drinking buddies who I‚Äôd thought were genuine friends is the price of admission for a life in which I don‚Äôt hate myself, it‚Äôs worth it.**

I already had a couple days under my belt and was feeling the urge to have one last hurrah on August 31st and starting fresh on September 1st.

On August 31st, I went on a 5k run with a couple friends. It was great. I had an excellent time. I had what you call a runner's high. It was the best feeling in the world. Afterward, we went to the local brewery (dumb, I know). I was feeling so fantastic and I wasn't even thinking about having a beer so I thought it would be fine. 

For the first hour or so, we were having a great conversation. I was enjoying it way more sober than I thought possible. It was refreshing. A breath of fresh air to be fully present and enjoy a conversation. My friends had started drinking, but I didn't ask the bartender for one.

In the past, I have frequented this establishment many a time, usually at least twice a week. I'm pretty good friends with the bartender because of this. While I didn't ask for a beer, he eventually asked what I was having. Without thinking, I just blurted out my usual.

I quickly decided, welp, guess I will have my last hurrah. As I started drinking, I immediately noticed how my enjoyment of the conversation was going down. I started thinking about the drink more and more. It started dulling my senses. By the end of the night, I had four beers. The night got progressively less interesting as a result. I got home and wanted more to drink, but I had thrown it all out a couple days before so went to bed instead.

In retrospect, I think this was a crucial learning experience. I learned that I am capable of having a good time without beer. In fact, the beer objectively made the night worse. I see that clear as day now. So while I did slip up, I think this slip up was instrumental on my journey forward. I saw the light. I got a taste of what sober life can offer. 

This time, things feel different. This time, I can envision myself succeeding. This time, I am free.

Here is to a brighter future.

Last night we celebrated a exciting new opportunity for my girlfriend at a nice fancy shmancy restaurant. She‚Äôs been such a great support, not drinking keeping booze out of the house and encouraging me - but she deserves a night out since we‚Äôve been laying low at home
Through these initial first days of my sobriety, so I gave it to her‚Ä¶..she wanted to sit up at the bar, you got it babe, she ordered some lemon drop martini, you got it - then because we were kinda there early the bartenders were coming up with the fall Line of new cocktails they brought two tastes over I declined and she got to taste several new drinks over the course of our meal. Of course like a normal drinker she only had one cocktail and barely Finished that, along with maybe 4-5 sips for tasting - like a normal Drinker does-  I ended the meal with coffee and cheese cake - wasn‚Äôt anxious felt nothing, didn‚Äôt give a shit, told the bartender straight up, nope
I don‚Äôt drink - she can taste em though - here I am feeling like million bucks -

When do they go away?,"*** I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice, just personal experience. I know these jerks aren‚Äôt dangerous, just frustrating, sleep-disrupting, and anxiety-inducing. Including my experience with meds in case others can relate***

So I‚Äôve been sober 3 nights now, I was a nighttime drinker to fall asleep. I was given Ativan for withdrawal but I don‚Äôt really take it anymore since I have pretty much no symptoms. What I do get though, is hypnic/myoclonic jerks EVERY TIME I‚Äôm falling asleep. Without fail. Every five minutes a jolt will go through my entire body. I can fall asleep without meds, which is when the jerks happen, but I end up having to take a bit of Ativan to make them go away.  

I don‚Äôt really want to be taking Ativan to sleep, so I wanted to hear from others who had these jerks when starting to get sober. Did they just go away at some point? How long did it take for you? Ideally I want them to just go away and sleep without taking anything. 

Sleep is a huge obstacle for me staying sober, and these hypnic jerks are currently the worst part. So if you‚Äôve had them specifically after getting sober (ik theyre normal once in a while but I mean every single time) please share your experience!! I don‚Äôt see a lot about them on here so I guess I just want to know I‚Äôm not alone in this. Alcohol is a pretty tempting solution 

I‚Äôm going to try magnesium/potassium supplements at night first and then 50mg trazodone if that doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll update my post on how it went tomorrow in case anyone‚Äôs curious.

Update: I take a multivitamin every day but apparently it‚Äôs not enough. I took a European supplement I had on hand (300mg potassium, 70mg magnesium, 60mg hawthorn extract, 1.4mg vitamin B6) an hour before bed and no hypnic jerk!",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5836492}"

1. I decide to ""Drink Responsibly!"" Start out the week with one sparkling glass (*see how ""normal"" I drink?!! I am basically a golden goddess of restraint.*). End the week with an evening guzzling six glasses and find myself throwing up at 4am, shaking and crying.
2. Come to the conclusion that I experienced a ""Basic Blip!"" (*what a weird turn of events, huh? How could this have ever happened?? Smh, yeesh*). Proceed to inhale 3 cocktails and 7 glasses of wine with old friends. Wake bolt upright at 3am and shakily devolve into an anxiety ridden internal diatribe of paranoia and shame.
3. A week later proclaim myself to be totally, completely, without-a-doubt, definitely FINE with just one glass. (This third act has basically the same outcome as the previous two; I'm just running out of words to describe the physical and mental anguish I'm batting around at the moment). 

I've decided to mindfully steer this storyline into a happy ending by using it as an experiment, a research project, an investigation. I'm going to look at it (through bleary eyes and a heavy heart) with curiosity and self-compassion. I'm going to give myself grace because I know what it's like on the sober side for me personally (it's fabulous and sparkling) and I also know what it's like on the blip-side.

I wanted to make my first post here to start planning for next weekend. For context, I was binge drinking 2-3 times a week, not chemically dependent but I couldn't stop after one drink, I always made myself feel ill as hell, wasn't even enjoying being drunk any more so decided to call time a fortnight ago. I'm also hoping to get pregnant sometime in the next year, so wanted to quit drinking while it was still a choice rather than a necessity, which might have felt harder.

My spouse goes out of town for work once a month, they're away for 3 nights and I have coped with this by getting drunk at least two, if not every night of their trip, every single month so far. Next weekend is the first time they'll be away since I've been sober and I'm worrying about it. I don't have many friends locally, I don't have anywhere to go or anything to do. I have complex PTSD relating to childhood abuse that I'm working on in therapy and it's going well, but being alone for so long inevitably leads to some kind of flashback situation at some point and I don't really have much confidence about coping with that without alcohol either. I know a whole load of coping techniques, it's just so hard to think straight enough to remember to use them when it kicks off.

Not expecting anyone here to have all the answers, I just want to say this out loud here so I can state my intention to stay sober even though it's going to be really hard, and maybe get a bit of support.",10,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5972853}"

I couldn't distract myself at all at home and wanted to drink, a lot. 

Instead, I went out and did 4 hours of grubhub deliveries until all the liquor stores closed. I did not drink. Now, I fixed the error and the customer was more than understanding. I'm just so happy I didn't drink because that wasn't going to help the problem. If anything, things would have been worse because I'd probably be hungover and late to work, making things even worse. 

As crappy as I felt yesterday, it showed me that we can deal with our problems sober. Drinking won't erase any problems. It may numb us from them momentarily but they will still be there. So, I will try to continue dealing with life sober and with a clear head. I'm proud to say I'm on day 18 tonight I plan to celebrate with cake.

I get these random thoughts about embarrassing events from the past, and I react with such cringe I just want to sink through the ground and die. All those feelings have started to become less frequent.

has anyone else felt this? I hope it will continue to improve with more time

Anyways, not 3 weeks yet. But it's a start. I really look forward to tomorrow.Since I won't be hangover tomorrow I'll take my girlfriend out on a hike. :-)

I know they're questioning their own drinking now and I hope I can be a good influence on them.
I'm so happy I found the right resources for me (This Naked Mind, Alcohol explained, this subreddit!)
When I started I didn't set my mind on a year, I thought maybe 6 months, to see if there was a real difference to my life. 1 year seemed daunting, Alcohol has been in my life since I was 14.

I can report
- better self-confidence
- overall healthier, I lost weight gradually as well without trying 
- I have the energy and motivation to adress my depression and anxiety now, not just with meds but with therapy and self-care and a curiosity about my feelings when I tried to shut them out before.
- There are still bad days but now I can actually deal with them by taking care of myself
- I am more aware of my surroundings, amazed by little things, the world is sharper, more colorful
- I am not bored anymore as I have found new things I love to do
- Getting home sober and getting into clean comfy sheets after a social event is the best feeling
- I am actually more sociable without the alcohol! This was such a surprise for me... 

I don't miss it. I think I could drink without falling back into habitual drinking but there's no point.
I was actually at a super expensive restaurant recently where the desserts included some alcohol and I ate it to please the host. It was disgusting and ruined the dish, even though I would have loved it previously and craved more alcohol afterwards.

Thanks to everyone for sharing their stories here every day. They helped a lot. I hope mine can inspire some lurkers or people who are having a hard time.

Yesterday I took my car for it's annual service. Agent calls and tells me everything is great, and they're taking it for a test drive. She called back within 5 minutes saying that when they drove out of the lot, the automatic boom accidentally came down on my car and scratched the whole side of my car deeply. They'll cover the repair and give me a courtesy car.

Get home. Suddenly my garage door won't open. The spring has snapped. So now I need a repairman for that.

Go upstairs to charge my phone. The wall outlet has blown and won't work.

It was a comedy of errors type of day. But since my anxiety decreased since quitting, I just handled everything as it happened and laughed it off. Went for a 6KM walk with my wife instead, and had a great evening. 

At no point during any of this did I think I need a drink. The thought didn't even cross my mind. What a wonderful experience.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Morning folks - can't believe my week is almost up. It has been an amazing experience - if you'd like to get involved and you have 30 days or more sober, give /u/sainthomer or I a shout.

So today - as i promised /u/sosiz \- I want to tell you all a little story about my shed. And like Moby-Dick is a metaphorical tale of human nature but also a great adventure story about one man harassing a whale who just wants to do whale stuff, this is a really about a shed but it's about some other things too.

I have this shed. It sits at the side of my house so I walk past it every morning, and for years it was neglected. The roofing felt came off one winter so it wasn't waterproof anymore and couldn't really be used for anything so it just became a dumping ground, rotting from the inside. Anything that went in there was going to succumb to the elements eventually and be covered in the slugs who had claimed it as their own.

It was a bowed and buckled shambolic mess, a total waste of potential and it made me sad to look at it.

For years I've been saying that I wanted to do something about it 'definitely this year' but I never would and winter would come again and it would get worse. It got to the point that I talked about just knocking the whole thing down or setting it on fire just to stop thinking about it.

Then earlier this year my brother came round with a big trailer and a brazier and said 'right, let's get this done'. We spent a dirty day pulling out everything that was in there, taking what we could to the tip and burning the rest. And it became slowly usable again. Since the big clear out I've fixed the roof, the windows that were boarded up, put in power so I can use it as an office to get my freelance business going. It's never going to be perfect and it's never going to be finished but now when I look out the window I see potential and something I'm proud of. Every morning it makes me happy and make plans for the future.

So what's the allegory here? Clean out the crap that's been building up for years so you can start improving things (get it to fuck, as Elaine would say)? That no one does anything alone? That maybe we'll never be perfect or never be finished but that time spent working on that is never wasted?

Or maybe it's just a story about a shed. Maybe Ahab just really hated whales.

Today, I flew back home, to the United States. I'm spending the night in New York, and then taking the bus up to Massachusetts to visit family. Since I flew in from Turkey, I didn't have the energy to go out and do a whole lot--I took an evening stroll in Central Park, grabbed a few $1 slices of pizza, and called it a night. 

For two to three hours, I kept thinking: *I'm so bored, and I've done such a good job for the past few weeks. How about I just get a small bottle of something, and go relax in the hotel*? 

I even opened Uber Eats and looked through the alcohol delivery options! 

I could picture myself: lounging in my hotel, mixing a few shots of cheap Fireball into a plastic cup full of Dr. Pepper. I'd just get the 375 mL bottle--probably enough to get me tipsy, after staying sober for nearly three weeks, but not nearly enough to set me down Bad Choice Road. 

Fortunately, I stopped myself. I did what /r/StopDrinking always recommends, and made a mental list of the reasons I stopped drinking. I also reflected on the benefits of sobriety. I sleep better, eat better, and feel so much more confident. What would drinking add to my night? Nothing of substance, nothing of value.

GI Problems, Anxiety, and mood swings","When I first began my journey to sobriety I did a fair amount of googling to see the timeline it takes to recover, how long withdrawal symptoms last, etc.  For preface, I began drinking at the start of quarantine and did not officially give up alcohol until the middle of June.  During that time though it was not uncommon for me to run through a 30 rack in a few days and then be going back to get more or an entire bottle of wine in a night.  I have ADD too so I would be taking adderall in the morning which I have heard bad things about together.   Throughout the year I continued drinking and only really stopped because I began having terrific digestive discomfort, problems, and pain, and I started getting panic attacks throughout the day.  These were very severe and from a person with no prior history with anxiety I suddenly became someone who could not even sit still with family or friends without the uncontrollable urge of feeling like you are dying, about to pass out, and just pure terror.  I know it sounds dramatic but I PROMISE that it has been extremely scary and a daily struggle.  I am now 80 days sober and have daily anxiety, but the panic attacks (sometimes 3-4 per day) have subsided a bit.  Still dealing with bad generalized anxiety though, terrible emotional mood swings, terrible irritability, and the worst symptom by far still is lingering GI problems.  I had an endoscopy and it came back negative for celiac, gastritis, and seemed to be normal, but tmi I have been severely constipated sometimes black small nugget or two that float othertimes almost completely liqued with a yellowish tint.

Several years ago a neighbor kid threw a football in my yard and it broke a window. I looked at it and it was rusted shut. We needed new windows anyway. So I got a few estimates for all new energy efficient windows but they were out of our budget. It always bugged me that it was boarded up and didn‚Äôt let in light. Sometimes bugs would get in too but I was paralyzed by the high price tag and didn‚Äôt do anything about it. This year my spouse got a job offer in another state so we are moving. Knowing that we couldn‚Äôt sell the house with a broken window, we were forced to replace it and since we were going to replace it, I grabbed some WD40 and pulled. The rusted window came right out. I took it to the hardware store and they replaced the glass for $12. I had this broken window that had bugged me for years and it was a $12 fix. 

We all have our metaphorical broken windows. These are things that we know affect our quality of life and need work but they just seem too daunting to tackle. Here are some things to consider:

1. An imperfect solution now is better than a perfect solution that never happens. 

2. Doing the thing is usually far less painful than thinking about doing the thing.

3. Acknowledging the problem takes its power away. 

4. Don‚Äôt blame yourself for dwelling on the broken windows. Just enjoy the light when they are fixed. 

5. Sometimes you need help to fix a broken window. Find the right help. 

6. You don‚Äôt need to fix all the windows. Just start with the one.",39,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5053645}"

In the last 7 years I have often drank to deal with the stresses and pressures of single parenting, a demanding career, unresolved childhood and relational issues, life. Poison of choice: wine. I have every other year vowed to stop drinking; but never followed through.

I turned 39 recently and even though those around me guffaw when I voice my concerns regarding my drinking patterns, I know that I have a dependency problem. 

In the last year of so I have taken to drinking near daily: I average 2 glasses of wine a day at home and if I‚Äôm socialising: 4 glasses. This might not seem much to some but the fact that it has become a near daily habit - particularly this year when I have grappled with serious anxiety and depression - worries me. And lets face it: when you drink to deal with stress, anxiety, fear and loneliness, you‚Äôre more likely to make risky, unhealthy decisions (overspending, casual sex, conflict, drink driving) which only add to the negative emotions you were trying to escape in the first place.

Last evening over a celebratort dinner with family I had 5 glasses of wine. We stayed up past midnight (a regrettable decision given I have a long roadtrip this morning) and because alcohol sometimes causes me insomnia, I only slept 2-3 hours before I woke up. 

I want better for myself and family. Today September 3, 2021 marks the day I stop drinking.

During my first 72 hours after quitting I was at a withdrawal management centre and they recommended that I attend one-on-one therapy sessions. I saw a therapist once a week for about 3 months. We tried to unravel how I let alcohol get the better of me given that my step-father was an alcoholic. When I was 16 I tended to him as he detoxed at home while my mother was at work. He got the DTs and convulsed. It was very scary to see. He quit drinking for about six months but went back to it and ended up drinking himself quite messily to death. Almost 40 years later I was headed down the same road.

We never did uncover the reasons why I let the alcohol get out of control but she felt we didn't really need to obsess over it. The important thing was that I was determined to never drink again. She did tell me that I could expect to have dreams about drinking for some time to come. ""Drinking was a big part of your life for a long time,"" she said.

She was spot on about the dreams. They would manifest in two forms:

1. Temptation. There's a glass full of my favourite alcoholic drink on the table with fresh ice cubes waiting for me. What am I going to do?
2. Too late. The glass is empty because I have taken the drink. What now?

I would wake from these dreams relieved that neither scenario played out in real life. The dreams continued for a few years but eventually subsided, growing less and less frequent. I haven't had one in well over a year.

My formative years were the late 90s and early 2000s. A hyper aggressive, commercialised and nihilistic period for pop culture and collective thinking. The age of Maxim and Girls Gone Wild, Limp Bizket and Eminem.

It occurred to me watching the documentary that in this era getting drunk and being a fuckin asshole was so common among young men. The people I looked up to at my sports clubs and workplaces were absolutely gross humans, the type you see in the documentary. 

Growing up, drinking and fighting, being disrespectful to women, trashing houses or public spaces was so regular that we never blinked at the fucked up things that happened. I grew up in a strange backwards part of the world but it seems the things I experienced are ubiquitous for people my age. And my parents were drunk too so they never even realise how messed up things were sometimes. 

I guess I wonder how much of my drinking was an attempt to numb my uncomfortable feelings around this kind of thing. Alcohol certainly helped me do things I would have never considered sober. A semi blacked out haze blocks the trauma of being involved in confrontation or in situations you otherwise wouldn't tolerate.

And then I wonder how many of us on this sub poured fire into our bellys to help us fit into this angry world. I see regret in so many posts on this sub but more positively than that I see a group of people who have made a decision not to perpetrate the bullshit that they grew up with onto the next generation.

Im not sure who even knows, i‚Äôm extremely athletic, I run and surf every day and eat really well, I‚Äôve had people respond with absolute shock learning that I smoke, having no idea about the 8 beers I‚Äôd had the night before. I‚Äôve never done anything that stupid while drunk like sending crazy messages, driving etc. this might seem like a good thing but as I think about it, it‚Äôs probably delaying stopping because beyond feeling terrible, there have never been that many consequences.
I think there are 3 main things that trigger me.
1. ADHD - I simply have too much energy, unless I‚Äôm really in the mood for it, watching tv, even a great show is so boring for me.
2. Smoking, without cigs I don‚Äôt really want to drink (heavily), with them, can put away 10+ beers, without I literally get bored with drinking after a few. It‚Äôs pretty obvious that I will be able to make this way easier on myself by quitting those.
3. Stress, well at least the way choose to respond to it. If something unexpected and bad happens I will sometimes simply react with ‚Äúwell fuck it, I may as well just be a piece of shit‚Äù.

I‚Äôve definitely reached the point where I WANT to stop, I really do. I‚Äôve had success in the past curbing the hyperactivity with weed rather than booze but I don‚Äôt want to rely on that for shutting me down, at least not regularly. So if there are any other ADHD people on here with insights on winding down in the evenings, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.

Anyway, thanks for reading. That‚Äôs the most I‚Äôve ever shared.",4,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.441084}"

Well well well,

I made it. One whole year. It was yesterday, i went to a meeting and my share SUCKED. I feel like perhaps it wasn't the mos t positive share especially for a birthday celebration with new comers and this morning i think i understand why.

Lately ive been having dreams of past traumas, yesterday i woke up from one and started my one year celebration, and i think the weight of sobriety was just on me. Dont get me wrong i am so grateful and happy to no longer be drinking. But i think its foolish to pretend everyday is fucking amazing. Today i woke up from a nice dreamless sleep and i felt it, the joy of looking forward to a new year in which i will be sober, yesterday i was saying goodbye to the first year i spent sober. I guess i was feeling a little melancholy. Not because im not enjoying my sober time but because because it has been hard. Of course it has, its a big step, its all those things i have been pushing down coming up, its all my traumas asking to finally be seen and dealt with. It has been fucking hard, the pink cloud is gone. Whats not gone is the promise of a somewhat emotional stability, the promise of time, the promise of intuition. I feel bad that my share may not have been the most positive, so i thought id post here and try again in a day or two at the same meeting. I am so grateful for all the 24s that got me here. I am grateful to my friends who have stuck by me through this. This year has been hard for all of us. but i wouldn't change it or my future for a single drink, cause thats it isnt it? All this work, pain, joy and new found freedom could be traded for a single drink.

I seriously enjoy the flavor of a craft beer or beautifully made wine.  What started as a passion and hobby for trying new wines and beers has turned into a habit over the past few years.  It started getting worse with the company culture in the last 2 places I worked.  Drinking was a huge part of the culture and liquid lunches and happy hours were absolutely encouraged by company leadership.  I loved it for a while but I developed the habit of drinking more and more and also using it as a way to blow off steam.

When I lost my job due to Covid the drinking really increased.  I‚Äôve always ‚Äúheld it together‚Äù and been ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù and it‚Äôs been something I thought I enjoyed for a long time so I never really thought about giving it up or taking a break‚Ä¶ until recently.

The last few months the increase in drinking has made me feel much worse physically and mentally and I believe it to really be holding me back in growing my business and being the best father I can be.  I‚Äôve scaled back in the past so when I tried to scale it back a bit over the past few weeks but wasn‚Äôt easily able to, It was a big red flag for me.  

Today I was at the store and went to grab some craft beers for the evening but I remembered this Sub and bought some La Croix instead.

I dont know if I‚Äôm done forever or just want to stop for a while but I do know it‚Äôs been a decade since I haven‚Äôt had wine or beer as a regular part of my life and I want to see how I feel when I‚Äôve abstained for a significant chunk of time.  One day at a time.  I want to know what I could achieve without it and how my life might improve.  Most of all I want that control back and I‚Äôm posting in here for accountability as I make the step.

I've tried to moderate over and over and over again. It works for awhile and always eventually leads back to the pit of despair that I can't climb back out of until my next moment of clarity, and when the fuck will that happen? Depends on a variety of factors. My last drink was August 31st and I plan on it sticking this time. 

If you experienced a fucked up childhood, get into therapy and get evaluated for PTSD. I've needed therapy and others have told me for years its a good idea but oppositional defiance combined with PTSD and low frustration tolerance...just didn't happen for a long time.

Over a month ago he disappeared into a hotel for seven days and drank himself to near death. During this time, I received a lot of feedback about ending things and having him leave my residence. Instead I decided to look up information for when he came home so that he can be placed into a rehab facility. I have been supportive, I have been taking care of his car, keeping his family updated, and I am still in possession of all his items. The first two weeks and some to follow he was missing me a lot, and could not wait to come home. 

He was due to come home today, but instead decided to change his aftercare plan to a halfway house. To which I was also in support of, but instead of him returning to our home afterwards he has decided to end our relationship and to come collect his items. He says the reason is he needs to put his sobriety first and he can‚Äôt Be in a relationship and do that at the same time.

My question is why would he do this? I am supportive, loving, and if we could have communicated about aftercare we could‚Äôve found a solution that we can still have a life together. He said he still feels the same way about me, but on top of ending our relationship he is unsure whether he will keep in contact moving forward. So I continue to care for his items until he lets me know what‚Äôs happening.

It feels very unfair. I have worked very hard to show him that I am his shoulder and his best friend, and support so why would he throw that all away?",2,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.5166443}"

Driving back from a big event, sitting in the passenger seat feeling drained, wobbly and sick - dehydrated and weak. The journey taking forever, minutes crawling by, desperate just to get to the safety of my own bed.  


But here's the plot twist:  


This time it had nothing to do with booze.   


In fact, we were coming back from a family holiday. A holiday where not drinking hadn't really been much of a challenge - and a holiday where we made lots of memories with our children, relatives and friends.  


Unfortunately, at the end of the holiday, I came down with a major dose of food poisoning. Had it not been for the fact I didn't want my eldest son to miss the first day in his new school year, there's no way we would have attempted the journey.  


The striking thing was that the aftermath of being really violently ill felt a LOT like a bad hangover. It gave me major de-ja-vu. 

I couldn't believe how many times I'd sat in the car feeling like that due to something self inflicted. It made me realise how ""well"" I usually feel nowadays. And it made me realise, beyond any doubt, that alcohol really IS a poison - one that the body has to deal with in the same way as a bout of food poisoning.   


I'm still recovering from the latter, but my son just got home from school after a fantastic first day back.   


I'm so glad I gritted my teeth through that journey, and that I don't plan to inflict that feeling on myself voluntarily any more.

That one peartini turned into +2 double gin and tonics. I left and walked to a bar down the street. My friend was bartending that night and he usually hooks me up for free. So que me drinking shot after shot, talking to a group of strangers all night (which would usually be fun to normal people if they weren't a small female, wasted out of her mind, constantly putting herself in dangerous situations and thanking her lucky stars that nothing has happened to her), and then blacking out to find out i had a mental breakdown outside of the bar because I had a panic attack from being way too drunk and also got really sad because of how depressed I actually am.
    I did this in front of 4 new coworkers, after I had quit my previous job for tons of reasons, but one of them being that I wanted a fresh start and to really try to be sober and get away from the people who have seen me wild out countless times. I am appalled and embarrassed with myself. I am drinking myself sick 2 or 3 times a week because I cannot do ""just one."" Me telling myself I'm not going to drink isn't working because a small voice in the back of my head whispers ""but just one,"" and then I lose control. Its like I can't help it. 
         I'm 4 days sober today thus far, I literally ran away from a drink offer after work last night because I almost said yes. I had to get in my car and get on the highway before the immediate craving that hit me could disapate. It was that easy for me to almost give in to drinking again, regardless of how sick I was on Monday. I DO NOT WANT TO BE HER ANYMORE. I'm done. I'm disgusted, finally, enough with myself and my behavior. I'm scared of how I've treated my body, and I know that I need help because I've figured out that alcohol is just a sick bandaid that I use to numb emotional pain and trauma that only winds up coming out in bigger ways when I black out. 
     I am sick of killing myself because something inside of me is killing me. I have to be done. I don't want alcohol to be the reason I don't do anything of value with my life, to be the reason of my unhappinees and to never find it at all, to be the death of me and everyone I ever knew says: yeah, I can see that that's how she went put, can't even say it's a shame. I am sick of being so sick all the time. 
     I'm also terrified of what sober life will be like for me because right now I feel like I don't deserve good things because of how shitty I've felt for years, abusing alcohol.

I am afraid of ""giving up"" alcohol. It is my best friend. But I have let it ruin my life. 
I am afraid of what people will say about me. Probably that I should have stopped a long time ago. My brother got sober about 2 years ago and he is doing so much better, it's astonishing really. 
I can make it to day 3 but haven't made it to a day four or five for years. I always just give up on myself and drink.
I drink because it relieves my stress. Well really it lets me forget my problems. And now they are all piled up. I have never posted before because I was never super serious about not drinking. I am one that thinks I am doing ok bc I don't wake up and drink, I don't get the shakes, I take care of my kids etc. But the reality is that I have two duis and a bachelors degree I will probably never use because of alcohol. I have more excuses why I am not ""some horrible drunk"" but the fact is alcohol is holding me back. But I am so afraid to let go. Like I am literally crying thinking about it. I have to trust that my life will be better. And I know it will be. This just sucks. 
I am ready to really stop drinking. But I am scared and feel like a loser for not being able to drink. Why is that? I read the naked mind but it's like I need to constantly read it because it all makes a lot a sense but I guess I've really been programed to love alcohol bc I just keep feeling like I failed at being able to drink. 
Thank you for reading. I plan on being very active (actually posting and not just lurking) on here and hopefully making a real friend. My brother is sober but he's kinda on a high horse about it so idk how much I really want to talk to him. My boyfriend hardly drinks but it's easy for him. He is supportive but not emotionally available (that's kinda his struggle). I think everyone will be glad I stopped drinking but that almost makes it worse. AA is not my thing.

I've been out of town with my mother since Saturday. I got home last night. The first few days I didn't drink. It was a non-issue as alcohol becomes after certain point of abstaining from it.

But then one night I had some wine with dinner. And I bought a bottle of wine and we took it back to the hotel. I ended up pouring half of that bottle of wine out. But of course, the next night my dumb alcoholic brain wanted to drink again.

And so the trip went. In general, we know that alcohol does not improve any situation. But it sure did help me on this one. My mother is a very negative person. I don't know how or why she has become that way. But as a rule, I avoid all negativity like the plague. Obviously I couldn't do that on this trip. I did try to steer her into more positive type thinking. And I told her she really shouldn't assume the worst in every situation. That even if something does go wrong, we are adults and we can handle it if necessary. 

Anyway. 

Yesterday morning I woke up and drank the remaining wine from the second bottle I bought during the trip... And poured some of it out. Then I had a bloody Mary at the coffee shop next door. Then I had a beer with lunch at the airport. Then while waiting for the airplane I had three double Hendrix and soda at a bar away from my mother. Then when we got off the plane in Nashville I bought a bottle of inexpensive vodka and went to the bathroom and put some of it in my water bottle I've been carrying around. And continued to drink that throughout the drive home.

Yesterday is a bit of a blur. Kind of okay with that though. It at least made me go to sleep.

Super hungover today. 

I'm also at home by myself and trying not to think about alcohol.

I don't think that drinking on this trip has truly sent me back too much. I'm also on a diet... And I ate a lot of chocolate cake too. I'm hoping that the alcohol can be like the chocolate cake... Which is not something I plan to eat now that I'm at home.

But I will be spending more time on this sub... When my brain says to go get alcohol... That you can start not eating cake and drinking wine tomorrow... I will get on here and spend all the time necessary reading about stuff to not drink today.

I‚Äôm in my late 50s, a professional woman whose drinking and weight have crept up over the past 3 decades, especially during the pandemic. 

In my 20s I was truly a social drinker, mostly on weekends.  In my late 20s I got married and had a couple of kids so there were literally years I didn‚Äôt drink while pregnant and nursing. But in my 30s I started having an occasional glass of wine or a beer on weeknights, etc. Once I became an empty-nester in my late 40s, drinking became daily, usually 3-4 drinks per night. I‚Äôve never had blackouts, DUIs, or problems at work due to drinking, but according to medical experts I was a heavy drinker for at least 10 years. 
During the pandemic I was privileged to work from home and realized how easy it is to day drink!  My average daily consumption increased to 6-7 drinks per day, mostly wine. I gained an additional 15 lbs. And my husband drinks very little, so I‚Äôve had to hide it from him, which, as many of you know, is time-consuming planning alcohol purchases, getting rid of empties, hiding the evidence.

I've been to several family gatherings since then where others around me were drinking, but I'd just have water or a pop instead. In those instances, I rarely felt the urge to have a beer, shot, or what have you.

Am I cured? Hell no, I'm an addict, and I'm going to be one for the rest of my life. But you know what? I'm content with that. It just means that without drugs being a pervasive thing in my life, I can focus on the things that really matter in life like practicing singing and playing guitar, spending quality time with family and friends and remembering everything. Not to forget most importantly my health, which I, not too long ago, thought didn't matter.

To be clear, retiring from drugs or any substance won't magically make your mental health issues go away. But without the constant fog or withdrawal, I can manage those things a lot better than when I was practically feeling dead inside from another one of my benders.

To those starting their first day, hell, their first hour sober, just know that it WILL get better in time. Be kind to yourself, go to the hospital or a detox centre if need be. 

We all understand, they will understand. But the key is, do it for you.

I'm so exhausted. And at present terrified , the reason being that there's been so many very near-misses where my life has been on the brink of utter destruction (nearly losing my job, losing my gf, and generally making trouble and obstacles for myself), and each time it feels like that should be the pinnacle wherein I say ""right that was close, I should stop drinking now before I lose everything"", but within days something resets in my head no matter how horribly and wrecklessly I've behaved and I do it all again. I'm losing faith in myself and my ability to stop. Can't shake the feeling that something horrible is going to happen and I'll have a breakdown, as has cyclically happened throughout my adult life. Just last night I drank til 5am and then was up for work at 7. If I hadn't gone in today I would've lost my job, as I've taken a lot of sickness recently, citing stress which is around 5% true, its actually because I've been too drunk. 

I speak to a drug and alcohol Councillor every few weeks on the phone, but I'm finding it really unhelpful as nice as the guy seems. He keeps pushing the same ethos: because I go days or even weeks without drinking, and half the time can have one or two and leave it there, he thinks I should allocate specific dates of the month to have blowouts responsibly, when I havent go work the next day, in the best environment possible etc. But then what about the days when I'm caught out the blue or feel sad or stressed and apparently have no will power to abstain? I'm terrible at that. I've found services and support available in my city totally unhelpful because of that very reason: they seem to think my problem isn't that bad because there's such big gaps in my drinking, but then when I do and go all out I can't stop and go into this weird hyper focused where all of a sudden nothing matters, I blow all my money, upset people and am on a knife edge of total destruction. 

Sorry for the long post, I just wondered if there's any similar ""problem drinkers"" who may have any advice or information on support or literature of any kind, anything at all :( I'm very desperate for this horrible ride to stop now :(",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.80576456}"

I almost completely resigned from my good paying job this week, canceling a long term passion project that would pay me thousands and jump start a career I've been working on for over a decade, leaving a great city to basically roam the country via car with my cash savings and settled in with my aging dad and step mom 1300 miles away with no job prospects or upward mobility there.

I have a therapist that's been sort of helping but don't see any reason to pay someone a $150 an hour to basically do something my friends do, but people are busy and I don't want to be a burden. Depression is a bitch because it doesn't let up until the life situation gets better. Medication turns me psychotic (can't take SSRIs) and been told it's not my head it's the situation.

She chooses to ignore her name most of the time, as cats often do‚Ä¶ although we have taught her ‚Äòare you hungry?‚Äô and ‚Äòdreamies!‚Äô (the name of her favourite cat treat).

I work from home permanently now, so her presence around the house has been such a help.

I have been mostly fine (apart from lingering headaches, dry mouth, weird sleeping patterns, which - I have learned from this community - is normal and will pass).

But. Yesterday I had a lovely dinner with (close, nice) colleagues. A fine restaurant, 5 course tidbit menu, with accompanying wine-arrangement of one glass (or more) of a different wine for each course. I asked the waiter instead to limit to two half glasses, which was accepted without fuss by restuarant staff. Though my colleagues asked why I was limiting myself, when I mumbled something inconsequential it quickly was passed over by the flow of conversation. Dinner was lovely, I had not much trouble sticking to the two half-glasses. I felt pretty good and proud when going home. 

But now it is the next day and I am not sure: am I proud for limiting myself? Or have I let myself down and should I have just sticked with no-alcohol like I did last two weeks? 

I am also uncertain: could I have limited myself if the staff had been less professional and offered to refill my glass as they did with my colleagues?

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!\*

\*\*Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!\*\*

&#x200B;

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

&#x200B;

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

&#x200B;

\---

&#x200B;

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

&#x200B;

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

&#x200B;

\*\*What this isn't:\*\* A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

 ‚ÄúEvery day, once a day, give yourself a present. Don't plan it.  Don't wait for it. Just let it happen. It could be a new shirt at the  men's store, a catnap in your office chair, or two cups of good, hot  black coffee.‚Äù     

 ‚Äï        Dale Cooper 

I try to keep the words of Special Agent Dale Cooper in my mind these days. For so long I denied myself these little treats that just make your day incrementally better but now I make a conscious decision to give myself a present. As we spoke about earlier in the week, it does feel a little transgressive, like something you're not *supposed* to do which is a little joy in itself.

Kindness is a radical act, kindness towards yourself can change your world.

There's a bit of scientific basis to this by the way, it's kind of rooted in breaking depressive cycles. For example, the cycle of depression is ofen spoken about something like this:

* depression leads to
* physical problems; poor sleep, fatigue, poor concentration. Which leads to;
* behaviours; social withdrawal, lack of productivity. Which leads to
* negative thoughts and feelings; low self esteem, loss of identity, hopelessness. Which increases
* depression

so by giving ourselves that little treat, that cake that looks good in the coffee shop window or that 20 minutes watching cartoons with the kids we can re-engage ourselves with the world and with things that ignite our inner selves rather than alcohol just dulling it all down. 

What little present are you going to give yourself today?

If you've got 30 days sober and you fancy hosting the Daily Check-In, let yer man /u/sainthomer or I know - I highly recommend it.

Just wanting to chime in and say that I appreciate what everyone posts here on this sub - whether it be the accomplishments, the ongoing daily milestones, the rawness of everyone's bottom. The encouragement you guys give one another. It's a humbling thing to realize that I too can relate to some of the feelings that are written within the confines of this community. This sub has been something I've referred to over the last 2 months on an almost daily basis.

And, I can't thank this community enough.

Some of these stories are so compelling, gut-wrenching, and just such a slap to the senses of what alcohol can do to the essence of a human being. Alcohol is something I grew up thinking I'd never have the tolerance for in my life. Seeing it completely destroy my family, and loosely wrap its grip around some of my friends early on(losing a few in affiliation to alcohol use as well) - it's given me a real understanding of what it can do. Although, I've let it slide underneath my nose for the past eleven years, and I've also admitted myself in for excessive use.

I always told myself I'd never let it get bad over the years. However, it just kind of creeps up I guess LOL. It was there when I was going through family troubles. It was there when I couldn't handle the burden and pressure of growing up - alone. It was there to numb the flashbacks from an endless array of life experiences I've had - without fear of judgement, or without it questioning me. It was readily available at almost every possible avenue when I was feeling not so confident in myself or my ability to endure the mental agonizing thoughts I've had. It was just there, ready for the picking, ready to be consumed and enjoyed, ready to be medicinal. Which is the weirdest thing to me - everything it did for me was the opposite of medicinal. It was absolute shit always, the entire time(apart from the taste of wine and mead).

This realization of it being shit *for me* was set in stone months ago when my partner had quit drinking. I'd notice my brain firing off some of the most outlandish things imaginable when I'd be alone at home drinking around this time period. The overthinking. The anxiety. The self deprecation. The fear of god knows what. It was a *constant* existence that I knew was not me. I'd even admitted myself to over the phone counseling to at least give myself some semblance of normalcy around three months ago, maybe more. I wanted my mind to have a resting point. While the counseling helped in its own way, it didn't resolve what I wanted in myself. It wasn't until I started observing this pattern of having just a happier time with and around my partner that the fucking light bulb went off. Her and I were spitballing, laughing, and getting along exceptionally without either of us under the influence. Meanwhile, other times when I'd be under the bottle and her not, I wouldn't feel myself anymore. I'd feel like I was robbing her of what my truest and best self was. It wasn't until a week ago that I now know that *I was robbing myself from me* with the almost consistent and non-stop, at times over the top consumption throughout the week or wherever.

I had my last beer this past Sunday, and his five brothers last Wednesday. It's the longest I've gone with the intent of pursuing a more sane life without this substance. Tomorrow marks seven days of actually sticking to my guns on the matter of quitting(I was too lazy to pour the beer out on Sunday, so I just said fuck it and drank it with my lunch as a final hoorah). That is the longest I've been able to muster the self reassurance that I can do it.

But yeah, this is the longest I've gone without it so far. I'm feeling good on it too. Really fucking good. And, I'd like to thank everyone in this sub for their time, stories, thoughts, communication and uplifting demeanor no matter the individual that you guys reply to. What you guys share with everyone here means an absolute fuck ton to me. It's crazy at how motivating this place is.

Coursera.org a free sight that offered free courses from universities around the world. I'm studying Chinese but they have everything....everything....no I don't work for them. I'm a glacier guide
Catching up with friends, family, just reminiscing and remember ing the past, while celebrating the future.
Exercise, I bike daily to random spots and just lose myself in nature. It really helps with the negative thoughts and voices that would previously lead me to downing a bottle of wine and sitting on my stoop.

 It feels great to be in control of myself, not waking up feeling bad, having the ability to say no to drinking even if I'm in a setting were a lot of people are, and go out and travel without exhaustion from the night before. It's nice to be in control.

However, I do catch myself wanting to go back every once in a while. Sometimes I think ""I could have one and be fine"" or ""I deserve to relax like everyone else can"" but that is not true and I know I cannot do that. I've accepted that and I understand myself better because of it.

But honestly those thoughts are in and out so quickly I hardly notice them now. Its just a thought... thoughts do not equal actions... and thoughts always pass with time. 

And there are also times when I am really hard on myself for drinking in the past and the things I lost because of it. And now those feelings pass quickly too, but its a good reminder of the consequences if I drink again and let go/lose control of myself. 

But what I've learned from being hard on myself is that it is to equally love myself. Self-Discipline and Self-Love are two sides of the same coin. You need both to conquer the thing (alcohol) that's holding you back.

I told him I am not drinking- and I know me and I won't care to drink with him anyway but it is the anxiety leading up to hanging with him or the me wanting a reward (a.k.a. drink alone on my patio) after I go out with him. He won't stop texting me about places to go which has me so overwhelmed today.

I have a doctors appointment this afternoon, unfortunately it's not a routine checkup. I ended up travelling for a few days and forgot to bring my diuretics with me, and that caused my ascites to just balloon really quick so I'm probably going to need to get another paracentesis. They only drained 5L of fluid 1 1/2 months ago, have about 15-20L total. The pills seem to be working though, not losing any of it, but it's maintaining it, I think I'm going to ask them to bump me up.  Also going to ask for another blood/LFT/INR test to see if my numbers have improved any over the past month and a half.  

Ascites really really sucks ass. The lethargy, back pain, constipation, difficulty sleeping is just awful. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I'm really hoping I'll end up like some of the stories I've read on here where people have recompensated after many months. 

Energy levels are come and go. I think I wasn't getting enough protein, the past week I've added 2 shakes (30g protein per) into my diet and seem to have a lot more energy, granted I still tire pretty easy, especially considering I'm carrying a 40lb basketball in my stomach. 

Urine is still dark, but has lightened considerably so hopefully that means my BILI has come down. 

I have been getting random bloody noses quite a bit now. My platelet levels were normal  (190) at my last test, so don't know what's up with that. 

Reflecting back on all this I always knew there was a risk to the liver from drinking, but I always imagined it was a decades long process, not something I would develop in such a short period of time. I guess I'm one of the ones with unlucky genetics. Alcohol is a damn poison and I do not miss it nor do I have any desire to consume it. 

Just going to keep taking things one day at a time, slowly, as my body allows me to. 

I wish I had positive things to say, because I know this post seems depressing, but if anything if you're on the fence about quitting, or are having a moment of weakness and thinking about picking up the bottle again, read this post, you don't want to potentially end up like me, it's not fun.

It has gotten progressively worse. I'm on medication, see a therapist regularly, eat healthy, exercise, etc. I don't know why, but my anxiety typically worsens at night and causes insomnia. For the past four/five years I have been on and off abusing wine to silence my anxiety and put me to sleep quickly. I mean who doesn't love drifting to sleep in the matter of seconds?! Anyways, I have been able to take breaks from wine for months at a time, but there is always something that triggers me to go back.

I'm currently in a bad rut with drinking red wine to sleep every night and it is definitely catching up to me. My face and body are constantly puffy, I'm putting on weight, I'm less motivated to exercise, it makes me feel guilty, and I ultimately hate how this drink has so much power over me.

I'm about to embark on a weight loss journey and I know that this problem will be the one thing holding me back from reaching my goals. Wine has so many calories, my tolerance is so high that I can drink 6-9 glasses a night which is probably adding upwards of 900 calories to my daily intake!!!

Essentially I know that no one on here can solve my problems. I just wanted to see if anyone else has struggled with the same dependence and what steps did you take to stop drinking? As I mentioned before, my dependence is completely based on anxiety and insomnia. Im scared to stop because I know I wont be able to sleep.",8,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.891787}"

This cursed, socially celebrated drug. 

I'm now 6 months sober. I've found that my mental health has been shattered by decades of abuse and dependence. With clarity and guidance, I see how long I was living on borrowed time. I thought I was ""functioning"" for years and now I know that I wasn't. 

I was a hollowed out shell running on the fumes of alcohol, routine, and muscle memory. 

When I finally quit, my own hubris struck the final blow to the paper thin facade of what was left of my mental health. Rather than admit the depths in which I'd sunk to seek help, I insisted on taking 20+ years of physical and mental dependence straight to the face as some sort of penance.  

The psychological damage this did is still crippling me. I'm now dual wielding mental health professionals. A therapist in one hand, and a psychiatrist with a bottle of pills in the other. When I described my initial week of abstinence to them, they both have made remarks to the effect of how close I may have come to death. 

But it's not JUST my own addiction that has impacted my life. My grandfather was an alcoholic. My father was a severe alcoholic. It cost him his marriage to my mother when I was young, and slowly drove him into an early grave amid his own constellation of miserable problems from addiction.

There was abuse in our relationship as a kid. Abuse that nudged me into the same path of addiction starting long before I could even drive a car. And his father abused him. I drowned that trauma, and other events like a juggler trying to keep things in the air while running as fast as they can away from it all. 

I've stopped running. I've stopped juggling. Half a lifetime of events have nothing left to keep them in the air. Like slamming the breaks on a semi trailer hauling a heavy load, momentum brings it all crashing down. 

Now, as I sit here in therapy and feeling like a lab rat waiting for the effects of prescription psychotropics to manifest and provide some measure of relief from the knots my brain ties itself in, I can't help but reflect on how unaware I was of the scope of it's role in my life. 

I have to contend with the fact that Alcohol and it's addiction are a major component that shaped who I am as a person. It was the dealer that gave me my hand in life, and the house I played against and lost. 

But I've played it better than my father, and his father before him. Neither man could scrape together 6 months of sobriety. Neither man seemed willing to do the work needed to get up from the table and leave the game with a few chips left to play elsewhere. 

I've at least managed that, even if it has brought me to the edge of sanity and left me with broken shards of my mental health to try and piece together.

This is only my second 30 day stretch since I started drinking, I believe. Definitely since I turned 21. The thought of alcohol has progressively turned me off more and more over the last year of my life. Lately, I want nothing to do with it. Every not now and then I‚Äôll think ‚Äúa drink might be nice right now‚Äù and then I immediately remind myself how I‚Äôll wake up tomorrow feeling like shit, regretting the decisions, potentially drinking more to ease the hangover, and starting a cycle all over again. 

For what? A couple of hours of not-so-fun fun? Potentially making an ass of myself to my friends and loved ones? Nah, I‚Äôm good. Over the last year I‚Äôve consistently had stretches of no drinking and have decided to develop better habits. I have a consistent skin care routine now, I‚Äôm drinking plenty of water, brushing my teeth twice a day, showering daily, working out 3-5 times a week, eating much better, and getting shit done that I never would have otherwise. 

For example, currently showed up to the DMV WAY too early to finally register my car in my state. I moved here 3 years ago and my tags expired then. I also was technically driving without a license because I didn‚Äôt know you had to have a license in this state to operate a vehicle and my license from my last state is still valid. But here I am, getting my car registered, my new license is in the mail, got everything fixed on my car, and I have all the paperwork for it. This is all just shit I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten around to if I was drinking. 

I‚Äôve also been playing music much more lately. I was always doing something musically, but I would take days away from it because I was drinking or too hungover. Now I‚Äôm in the rehearsal studio 2-3 times a week perfecting my craft and hoping to get back out to playing live gigs soon. 

I feel great. My energy and mental clarity are at an all time high. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôll never drink again, but extended stretches of sobriety will be a part of my life forever.

Two months went by and I didn't drink , It still wasn't for me though . My court date came and I thought about what I would do if I beat my case . I considered a nice tall beer with a double of bourbon for starters .

Then it hit me , I had been sober for two months and I actually felt good . I was starring to feel more and more human . I was starting to feel alert ,I was starting to regain cognitive faculties I thought I had lost . I was losing weight and my skin looked better . I was actually beginning to thrive again .

I made the decision right there in that court room that day ,I was going to quit for good , I was quitting for me . 

I won my court case . My lawyers tenacity combined with covids ability to create confusion in the legal world fostered a scenario that left me a free man . Not only legally but now some what emotionally as well . 

Over the next year I faced many ups and downs . I had plenty of times when I didn't think it was worth it any longer; then some little voice would whisper in my ear "" You can't not do it"" ( bonus points if you can name the show the quote is from ) . 

Now I am finally living on my own , I have a better job , better health, better relationships with family and friends . I still don't have a dog or a significant other . However I know somethings take time  .

My journey is far from over . I still dream about drinking  ( like actual dreams ). I still get antsy sometimes when I see people drinking and  not being sloppy . I catch myself thinking "" hmm what about just one little shot"" then I play the tape and remember the last shot I took catching in my throat and how I burped up warm boubon .

We lived in/above a liquor store which my parents ran, and daily drinking for them was the norm. The rest of my family are distant so any visit was a celebration coupled with more drinking.

I started working age 15, and payday Thursdays was a visit to the pub as a team, this went into my social life as it does but then started to overflow. My mother's alcoholism around this time became intolerable. She would physically fight my dad and her rages meant things got broken; crockery, picture frames, wardrobes (she tried to use it to climb into the attic to get her suitcase to move out during one argument with my dad) Eventually she kicked him out, then just as I turned 18 she kicked me out, and my sister followed shortly after.

Once I gained my independence and got back on my feet I drank more and more before quickly settling around a bottle of wine per day. (I couldn't stomach much beer at this stage which made me vomit). If I didn't go out, I'd drink it at home, maybe with friends, but with or without; I'd drink.

I lost jobs had relationships but the alcohol didn't go away. It's all I've ever known. One relationship introduced me to the joys of whiskey.

Fast forward, I got married, settled down, but drinking every day (read evening) was totally normal. By now I'm on spirits and beer and can drink myself ""sober"" (which I'm totally aware is far from). All our family are distant, so when we visit, we're all drinking in celebration! So nobody noticed (at least my Nan was the only one to ever comment on it... )

\- I rarely got properly drunk drunk (although I lie to myself and discount the times I did)

\- I rarely had blackouts (although I know I have had some and I've probably forgotten more)

\- I don't have hangovers (I just feel tired all the time and have occasional headaches for no reason)

\- I'm a happy, chatty drunk, not an obnoxious one (apart from the odd broken glass, or broken door to fix after spousal argument)

\- It helps me socialise (Outside my family and work colleagues... I have no actual friends, zero people I could call if my house burned down and ask to use their sofa, I left them all behind over the years)

\- It helps me relax (apart from the constant anxiety of ensuring I have enough alcohol every single evening, the panic of being called into a work call after more than I'm used to mid-afternoon, adjusting the lighting to hide the redness in my cheeks, and the worry of my no-longer-18-year-old manhood who when called upon has lately been caught snoozing... and what if I need to drive my baby to the hospital urgently?)

Now I'm about to turn 40, I've been drinking for 25 years, non-stop for 20, the days I've gone without alcohol in that time could be counted on fingers alone, I've been married for over a decade and we have a young child.

But now I've fallen out of love. Completely out of love. I thought I fell out of love with my wife at several points, out of love with my life often, and out of love with myself constantly... but it turns out my bitterness has been misplaced. It's the realization of where that train of thought would lead me that brings me here; before the next pillar crumbles. I'm watching my sister lose this same battle, her kids have gone to their dad, and I'm in no place to point out her mistakes when I'm on the exact same path.

I managed a few days off with Annie Grace's Alcohol Experiment (highly recommended) and despite the fact I ""fell off the wagon"" after a few ""attempts"" and went back to my old ways for several months, but I couldn't shake off the memory of how good those few days felt. I woke up feeling better and spent the entire day, even the evening feeling more energetic, alive and awake. I started worrying I wouldn't be able to sleep, but then something odd happened; I felt naturally tired for the first time in a long time, and had no reason to stay up for 'just one more'. I didn't sleep all that well initially, but the next morning I still felt better than the week before when I knocked myself out. After a couple of days I was sleeping better, when woken by a toddler with a nightmare I felt more competent and less stressed, less tired than I would normally feel at 3:30am, and still woke up feeling better.

I'm now reading 'Alcohol Explained' by William Porter (also highly recommended) which is a fascinating expos√© on the chemical. He takes a very factual approach and talks about how the addiction takes hold and why we are so out of control. He even covers all of the symptoms; many of which I didn't even realise were symptoms and explains why and how they exists.

I've been poisoning my body, life, and relationships for too long. I want to be a part of my life again.

I will not drink with you today.

It‚Äôs been two years since you stopped talking to me, and I‚Äôve been missing you a lot lately. For ten years I thought we were thick as thieves, we told each other everything, we spent so much time together- you were my emergency contact and the first person I called when anything important happened. I stayed with you when my marriage ended, and you‚Äôd acted as witness to that marriage. One year you gave me a card that read ‚ÄúI hope we‚Äôre friends until we die, and ghost friends after that‚Äù. I finally threw that card away last year.

Once I stopped drinking, things changed. You got a lot closer with a drinker that didn‚Äôt like me, who made a big show of gaslighting me when you were around, and treating me like a piece of shit anytime you weren‚Äôt. You stopped inviting me to things, you even neglected to tell me when you weren‚Äôt planning to show up to things you knew I expected you to attend, leaving me looking foolish and friendless when I showed up alone. 

I moved away for my PhD, and by chance you ended up moving to the same town. I thought maybe that would fix things- that our friendship was strained because of your new friend who didn‚Äôt like me- but things only got worse. Once your communication had dwindled down to a ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù with no response to my reply every six months or so, I asked that we switch from texts to phone calls to communicate, and I never heard from you again.

It's still tough to accept that you were just a drinking buddy. That we spent so much time together, shared so much, and leaned on each other so hard because we were using the same crutch to get through everything. We knew we could count on one another to react to any stimulus with a few bottles of wine, and when that changed, there was just less value in our relationship for you. I keep thinking about ways I might have failed you, defects in my personality that were bad enough for you to cut me off with no explanation. But I have to stop these ruminations and let you go.

I've stumbled upon this community 3 months ago, thanks to reddit suggestions. Since the beginning you all have been opening my eyes to a problem I've been ignoring for some time.

I'm 30 and alcohol has been present in my life since I was 15. I relied on it as a social lubricant, as a tool to ""cope"" with the sad times, as a way to ""enhance"" the good times, as sleeping medicine, I'm sure some of you can identify...

What I now see is that it has turned me into an anxious, whining and angry fatso. Not to say it has made me dumb, but I'm not as creative and ""sharp between the ears"" as I once was, which is really really important to me. I've distanced from my friends out of embarrassment of drunk times, up to a point where I'd rather get a buzz/blackout at home alone rather than get together and just socialize.

About a year ago, my GF and I moved in together, and since then I've been  drinking nearly every night. We both enjoyed it, and it was more of a ""party never ends"" - singing, drinking and enjoying ourselves.

 But it took a toll. I can see now how stressed it made me, angry at my job (which I actually love) because I was hungover everyday, being in a shitty mood until I clocked out because it was booze time. Too lazy to exercise or seek further professional development. Passing out instead of sleeping almost every single night. Buying booze almost everyday because ""you can never have too many beers"". 

After some time contemplating, and a weekend bender to ""make sure this is bad"" at the end of July, I've hit a month sober (yay!!). I feel so much better now, and everyday I come here to read your stories - which always help me see how I'm not missing out. The ""you will never regret not drinking the night before"" rings so true to me and has helped me a lot. 

Things I've read from people with single, double and multiple digits really opened my eyes to the fact that alcohol does not improve anything at all (at least not really). Life is way better when experienced sober, when we are truly here for when it happens.

I wish I could award each and everyone in this community, you are great! Thank you so much for being here, all of you!! Together we can do this!!",24,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.5939419}"

And man, coming here has not only helped me not feel alone, but has served as a warning that even just one is a slippery slope. Reading about your successes and slips has made such a difference in my ability to keep going.

Not going to tell my story here,  check my posts - it‚Äôs all there. Hasn't changed.  Miracle of the titty bar is worth reading if you have the time.

What I want to tell you is that you can do it too.   And it‚Äôs easy. (at least most of the last 33 years)  
  
Wasn‚Äôt in the beginning; I slipped and slid, tried to find loopholes with my name on them, explored every form of moderation including weed.   I struggled, I rationalized, I refused to see the writing on the wall.

There was an old timer in the meetings who used to say, ‚Äúit‚Äôs a piece of cake‚Äù.  I hated him.  I was still addicted to anger, and its cousin, drama, back then.   Turns out he was right.

Today I am comfortable in my own skin.   Today I do not live a life of lies, deceptions, or avoidance.   That alone makes life so much easier, maybe not cake, but biscuits certainly.  I have discovered I can help others, and I do.  Gives me pleasure and satisfaction .  That anger I mentioned earlier, it‚Äôs a lot less.  No drama.  At this point I am definitely in cake territory.

Life itself has not been easy, but I‚Äôve avoided making it a whole lot harder when things were hard.  Or good. (I was an equal opportunity fuck up) 

Here's a list of some of the things I haven't had to drink over. Being sober gave me the ability to handle them as they came along.

Both my parents developed long, lingering ailments and died while I was sober.  I was able to show up and do adult things that may have made things easier for them.  I gave them one less thing to worry about and hopefully more.   Drinking, I would have made it about me.   

My marriage could not be saved.  Again I adulted and resisted drama to everyone‚Äôs benefit.  Not easy, but not nearly the shitshow I saw other couples create.   I got stuck in a rut at work, went nowhere.   Finally an opportunity came, I took risks, dealt with management, and worked in ways I hadn‚Äôt when hungover or taking liquid lunches.   I did the impossible, took the heat off my new boss, got out of the rut.  I dated in recovery, got married again, this time to someone who is emotionally available.   I was sober for the weddings of my daughters, I had a front row seat for Sept 11 (when I had a brief but fierce desire to drink (the first in years and hopefully the last)).  

I took early retirement, nearly published my novel, but had victory slip through my fingers twice.   I followed another dream and resurrected a sailboat only to learn my wife did not share my dream and was terrified at sea.  Wife or boat?  Chose wife, (will admit I did think about it briefly), it was a significant slap to what I thought was my happiness.  Did not wallow.  Got over it. Got on with life. Found other things to be happy about.    

Like it or not, my wife and I are aging, there are medical issues, but alcohol isn't one of them.

Life is good I‚Äôm active in AA and on a couple of subs here on Reddit.  I live in a small, slightly dilapidated house In the woods, (today I  survived and fixed a leaky pipe.  I have enough.  

Alcohol would have made any of these, and many more, so much worse.  

PS: I used AA, am agnostic, still not jesusized.  There are other paths, try them by all means, but AA worked for me despite all of my issues and resistance.

My specialist stopped prescribing it because it was not helping my illness, but I found the courage to ask my primary doctor if he could prescribe a normal dose (instead of a low dose) to help curb cravings going forward.

With that Ive seen a trend of establishments calling themselves ""sober bars"" opening, doing fake cocktails, offering a variety of teas, coffee as well as entertainment for lounging like someone dj'ing w/ vinyl chill music as well as a bunch of board games to play. They also stay open kind of late, till like midnight sometimes 1am on weekends.

The very first one opened in my city and its everything I describe plus a vegan eatery. They even have merch such as shirts that literally say ""I F\*\*\*\*n love being sober!"" on it and it makes me cringe. I feel its too gimmicky and off putting. Its filled with a bunch of literal kids when I go, especially on weekends and I feel very uncomfortable considering Im like 30.

I used to live another major city that was a huge college town and their coffee shops stayed open super late till like 2 am or even 3 sometimes. It was nice because if you didnt want to go to a bar, you could go to a cafe, drink coffee, tea buy a bagel and chill in a corner, read get on your laptop, whatever till late.

I guess what Im getting at is I wish there was more dry cafe's that were open where sober people could go to socialize without being surrounded by teenagers all the time. Like have an age restricted cafe but then again where will these young kids go to hang out too, ya know?

That drink which was supposed to be ‚Äújust a shot or two‚Äù ended up being nearly an entire bottle of vodka and landed me in the ICU with a 0.60 BAC (yes, you read that right!) That drink almost killed me‚Ä¶but it also was the drink that woke me up. It was the one that finally proved to me that I will never drink in moderation. 

My life has completely transformed in those two years. I was jobless, broke, had no driver‚Äôs license, was facing jail time, and my relationships were in shambles.

Today, I make $50k a year at a job where I am highly respected, I got my license back, successfully completed a year of probation with zero violations, and my relationships are completely mended. Back in April, I even married the man who stood by me through the worst of my alcoholism. 

My advice to you if you‚Äôre struggling is this; seek medical help if you‚Äôre physically addicted. Don‚Äôt just go ‚Äúcold turkey‚Äù. Then, get support. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs AA, SMART Recovery, a church group, therapy, whatever‚Ä¶just surround yourself with all the support you can. You‚Äôre going to need it. Know that you WILL have rough days. Hell, I had days this past year where I sat in the parking lot of the liquor store balking my eyes out because I wanted a drink so bad. I got through those days by telling myself, ‚ÄúATG8605, If you can just wait a few hours and see how you feel, then come back if you still really want it. Just call someone first.‚Äù Not once did I want to go back to that liquor store. Just take it one day, one hour, one minute at a time. 

Recovery IS possible. There is another side to this tunnel you‚Äôre in. If you just keep putting one foot in front of the other, keep doing the next right thing, and don‚Äôt pick up a drink‚Ä¶I promise, you will be amazed by the view from the other side!

I was not checking in here, like I had done at my most days sober (multiple times a day.) I wasn‚Äôt actively avoiding it, but just was trying to distance myself I guess. I don‚Äôt know. 

    I had one hell of a bender summer. Not daily, but a few three day long ones resulting in a few days of withdrawal etc... Lots of time wasted really, you all know what I mean. 

    I had been doing excellent. Sober for a few months, got in to the intensive LPN to RN program I had never thought I would, and now one week today I start my nursing degree program, entering into the second year. 

    I excused my binging etc saying once I start school I won‚Äôt be able to do much of anything. This was after having told myself I was going to eat well and get in better shape, so as to start the program as my very best self and give myself my best chance at success. 

    That changed to deciding to quit once I started in mid June, two weeks before the program. Here I am now, it took me a week past what I wanted to have under my belt too quit. 

    I also had a doctors appointment today to review bloodwork I needed for school. I‚Äôm 30, and have been drinking pure vodka shots (a flask at least) multiple times a week (at my worst, between my little sober stints) for over 10 years. 

     I was convinced I would have liver damage, even worried I would be told I‚Äôd have to one day go on the transplant list. But nothing. It was all within normal levels. I feel like I‚Äôve been given another chance. I hope my alcoholic mind doesn‚Äôt try to convince me it‚Äôs another chance to drink without that threat, but I bet it will. 

     I just had a lovely bath, gotten into clean pajamas and will finally clean up the house that I‚Äôve neglected during my binge/recovery time. There‚Äôs still a garbage bucket next too my bed with throw up in it. Gross.

I liked it before I went on a three-week vacation but somehow coming back has made me see how awful it is. I've been depressed and barely functioning at work and everyday is torture walking in. Today was the worst day I've had in awhile and I shelled up and avoided people as much as I could, even walked in before my friends arrived to avoid talking to them. Probably the worst thing to do when you're super depressed is to isolate even further. It reminds me of drinking in a way; depression makes you take steps that make your further depressed just like drinking kills your mood and drives you further into the bottle.

I get home and get a text from my mom. My grandma is probably going to die later today thanks to Covid. I'm upset, but even more upset because my cousins side of the family -- a bunch of anti-vaxxers who think covid is a government hoax -- all got sick and gave it to her. Her death isn't just ""her time being up,"" it's because her own family members were stupid and killed her off. So I also have a HEAFTY dose of anger coursing through my veins.

Classic setup for me to drink. I'm depressed, hate my life, think everything is pointless, hate my family, and I'll have to deal with her loss soon. It's like a giant wave looming over me where I'm waiting for it to break. If I'm ever going to drink it would be today, but what's the use in doing that?

I could feel better for a few hours, but when I wake up life will be there waiting for me as it always is. Work is going to suck, I'll be miserable, but do I also want to be hungover as well? If my grandma passes the alcohol won't bring her back, just toss my mood into a further downward spiral. I want to banish my feelings for awhile and alcohol doesn't work well for that. You get a few hours of oblivion, sure, and then life comes rushing back at you.

I was terrified that I'd end up raising children in that dangerous and chaotic environment. In sobriety, I can see that this is *so* not true. I can have a beautiful sober life surrounded by loving, supportive people. I can be in healthy, loving relationships that are built on mutual respect. I can start a family in a home where drugs and alcohol don't cause knock-down fights every night. I can raise incredible little humans who never have to see their mom drink.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\*\*This pledge is a statement of intent.\*\* Today we don't set out \*trying\* not to drink, we make a conscious decision \*not to drink\*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

\*\*What this is:\*\* A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

Good Morning! Glad to see people enjoying my profane nonsense yesterday - I hope that it's useful to someone even if it just makes you smile!

Today I want to address a something I see a lot from posters here in their first few days sober or often before they've made the decision to quit - ""should I quit? Am I an alcoholic""?

The simple, although possibly a little glib response here is - does it matter? I don't know if I was when I came here - but I do know that I wanted to stop enough to be seeking out this community and I know that I tried to stop many times unsuccessfully. For me, that was enough. 

Something that really helped me in the early days was thinking about this - if someone offered me ¬£100,000 to stop, what would I say? It would be totally mad to say no to that and yet my initial, instinctual response was to umm and err about it. I'm not sure. Is that enough?

(swap this in for an equivalent amount in the relevant currency for you - basically, enough to make a massive difference to your life money but not like buying a yacht and moving to Monaco money)

Thinking in that way about it made me realise how much it scared me. I understood then just how much control I was giving booze over my life. And that it was taking away much more than it was giving.

Stopping drinking has massively improved my quality of life - keeping drinking would only have made it worse or at best kept me where I was, which was a pretty miserable place. I'll never regret that.

Oh, and by my maths I'll have saved that ¬£100k in about 15 years by not spending it on drink! What are you going to do with yours?",266,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.52643776}"
