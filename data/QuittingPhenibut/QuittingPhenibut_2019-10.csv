I don't share on here because I don't have experience with phenibut addiction, but I read r/quittingphenibut posts just about every day.

And it's almost certainly kept my ass out of the fire. Left to my own devices without hearing about the dark side of phenibut, I easily would have gotten in over my head. As it is, I use once a month or so and leave it at that.

Thought I'd share this because I suspect you guys know that you are helping one another at your various stages of quitting. But this sub has probably helped countless people who are just learning about phenibut or starting to play around with what they can get away with on it. 

It's important stuff. Thanks.",12

I’ve been taking around 6gpd for 2 months, but this last few days it seems like it’s just not working. I feel fucking horrible. I almost want to try and stop cold turkey just to see if I feel better.

I'd like to jump completely but I think I may have screwed myself here. switched to the split dose because I started to experience really bad insomnia. I also take kratom which I've been addicted to for awhile and used phenibut to assist in tapering that. 60gpd + habit down to 10g-16g a day but I still take it and the two interdose w/d's in unison is quite dreadful.

feet sweating pins/needles, no sleep, isolation, lack of motivation, cold/hot, etc..

I have a few ativan that I guess I could start today and get some work done. I could go ct tonight and use the lorazapem over the next few days to get me off the daily light phen usage, to focus on the kratom issue.

I took my .60 dose at 11:30 so maybe it hasn't even kicked in yet and that's the issue?",1
2019-10-30 17:47:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dpdg4p/worst_nightmares_last_couple_of_nights/,Worst Nightmares last couple of nights,"Had the first nightmare two nights ago. I was in Brazil for some reason at a hotel and I was leaving. Walked out into a very very congested hallway with about two inches of room from my left and right. They were 3 young boys there. Two of them were looking away and didnt really want to participate. One in the middle has a gardeners pair of scissors. He came out at me with them and tried to stab me.

I grabbed it before it penetrated and was scared of course. There was a door behind me and I closed it and locked it. Felt a feeling of relief. As I turn around, the door gets slammed open by all three and the middle one looks at me with a 1000 yard gaze and I wake up. 

The dream I had last night was far more scary for me. Was in a very very metro and new tech looking mall. I'm walking around with my brother confused as to where I am. Asking him what this place is. I remember I felt Phenibut high, and was intoxicated. I remember seeing cops there and I was running with them for some reason. 

I ended up leaving my car there cause I was too fucked up or something. Went on a ride with my brother and his friends. They weren't really his friends just random people in the dream. We were in the one of the ""friends"" cars and he was driving recklessly. 

He took a turn down a steep set of stairs and cut the wheel and made it down the stairs unscathed. Another set of stairs appears in front of us and this time he drives towards the rail. 

Before we hit the rail, I get jumped out of the car towards the sky, like a seat ejector. I go flying into the air, probably about 30-35 feet in the air, and at this point I'm getting the butterflies you get when you're on a roller coaster. 

It felt as if the people in the car where holding me up into the air with their hands trying to hurt me. I go down towards the pavement in a high velocity. As most dreams like these go, I wake up before I hit the pavement. 

I wake up in a panic, and I as I realize it was a dream, I relax and am fully awake. Ended up taking a Benadryl so I can sleep and some more Phenibut so I don't have another nightmare. 

What are your Phenibut withdrawal induced nightmares? If I have another tonight, I will add it into the comments. I'm not totally sure how to go about tapering at night time.

EDIT: Had another night terror several nights after writing this post. This was one was exceptionally bizarre. 

I was playing with mini rapier swords (basically fencing swords) and I was stacking them on a table. There was probably about 10 of them from which I could see. I would stack them sword tip down and as I'd place the last tip on its head, it would always fall on my face and impale me. I'd take it out and continue. 

The rapiers later became very sharp miniature axes. They'd fall on my forearms and leave huge gashes. The last axe that fell on my arm left a much bigger impression than the rest. My arm was cut north and west all upon my upper forearm, it looked similar to grill marks on a chicken breast if you rotated it 90 degrees each side before flipping. 

I lifted my arm and it felt as if it was about to fall off and the gashes were about to burst open. I wake up alarmed, immediately look at my arm and if you guys have ever had a dream where one of your body parts get cut or some sort of bodily harm happens to you, you can actually see the damage (in the dark) for a second before reality rears his head at you. It looked real, and then it wasn't. Phenibut withdrawal isn't fun",1

I spent a lot of time in this forum helping others get through their withdrawals after I did. I just really need help right now. If you haven’t read my post history- currently taking 8.4 grams 3 times a week. Two days in between each dose. My plan is for the next couple weeks to drop 500 mg each dose until I get down to 5 grams and then I want to jump to baclofen daily and taper off that. I also have gabapentin on hand too but that doesn’t help me much. Does this sound like an okay plan for now? I don’t know how I will taper the baclofen yet but I don’t want to be on it for long. I just need off this drug ASAP. I may be able to get some time off work but right now I don’t know. I’m scared and I definitely recommend not doing what I did.

2019-10-29 11:03:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dor2at/fairytale_ending/,Fairytale Ending.,"Hey, I have a couple of posts about losing my mind on here that I made early 2019. I started tapering/attempting to quit back in November 2018. My last dose was in May 2019. It's now been a while and I still remember the surreal feeling the first week after tapering, constantly expecting the awful anxiety and dread setting in. Well it never did. I had attempted 4 CT withdrawals and yeah... you guys know how those can end. Ugly would be a massive understatement.

Ok that's my mini bio, now here's what this is actually about. (EDIT: Please regard the medical information/statements in the post with caution. I just want to make clear that I'm not a qualified Doctor. All of this information is from my understanding and while I've done personal research for years now most of my professional work focuses mainly on function of medications that sometimes relate to the subject. I stand behind my statements and try to only use information from medical studies/sources. Still I'm far from perfect and as everyone my personal experiences and views create a bias. It is reasonable to assume that I missunderstood information or took the wrong conclusions, so please verify for yourself.)

1. I have less anxiety now than I've ever had before or on Phenibut and it's been only about half a year. I got diagnosed with mdd and gad as a teen long before any substance use. Experiencing Phenibut addiction has forced me to cope and overcome. Always remember that. There's 2.1 paths here. 0.1 You keep taking Phenibut which will eventually lead you to either path 1 & 2. Path 1 is death, whether by OD or Exitus (shouldn't be an option but it was definitely on my mind alot during WD). Path 2 is the end of Phenibut. You stop and live the consequences are almost universally positive. You have overcome something and build strength, you have more experience in dealing with your negative emotions. Don't give in to the Idea of permanent damage and effects like kindling. I'm not a doctor but I graduated in Pharmaceutical Technology (rough translation of Major name in German). Despite my knowledge I was highly concerned about the permanent effects as its very in tune with the general feeling of dread about anything to come I experienced. In retrospect all these processes are extremely unlikely to result as a consequence of Phenibut abuse less than a decade long. Even then were talking very unlikely. Outliers to this are the Kindling effect and Liver Cerrosis. There simply is a higher chance for them based on the other general habits of a patient. Kindling effect is overstated. It is there and it has been observed ,albeit not sufficiently, in every primary gabaergic drug used clinically. The major consequence still seems to be increased perception/experience of withdrawal mechanisms. There is no current way to differentiate the perceived effects and the actual neurological increase as both influence each other. A key indicator for some sort of measure of the perceiptive increase in a person could be the amplified reaction of repeated withdrawal to an abused substance by patient (phenibut) vs a minor increase of reaction to withdrawal from a related gabaergic drug prescribed and used in a medical treatment procedure.
2. The recovery is faster than you anticipate. Possibly a positive effect of the expectation of no remission. For me personally negative aspects I attributed to phenibut withdrawal and addiction ended 5 weeks into ceasure of final dosage. I am currently at a point where I only have a faint idea of what it felt like and I find it difficult to emphasize fully with the feelings experienced then. I know it was very difficult but I don't feel so. It is very comforting to know that something as bad as that now takes the same emotional toll in my head as failing and important exam in high school.
3. You all know this deep down, you're just not sure and need reaffirmation. If you can find it within you and you trust yourself enough that's great. If not, take my word for it. I might not have had the worst starting conditions but I was in the bottem of the bucket. It will get much better than you can imagine. You've traded a good baseline in for a fast burning euphoria. Relativity determines all when it comes to our personal experience of emotions. You can't feel relaxed if you're never stressed and you can't feel good if you never feel down. We need an up and down in our life, the contrast makes the picture pretty. Attempting to eliminate anxiety and negative emotion form your life with phenibut will create a lifeline that's very flat. It's difficult to go up from euphoria so you're stuck in a frequency of new negative and the baseline. You know this. You've experienced it plenty. The added problem is the chemical aspect of medication. You mentally adjust your baseline to your experience yet the medication will still release dopamine. There will be down regulation. You might live a healthy live but your brain won't mimic it because of your interference.

Everyone says to just slowly taper but I really just want to get off quickly and I also don't know if I have the will power to do a full taper. I am a recovering alcoholic/opiate addict.
Talked to a detox that is familiar with this drug and their protocol involves giving me clonodine, visteral (an antihistamine!?) And robaxin (muscle relaxer). 
Not sure why I am posting this just looking for advice/support I guess. 
The hardest part about going to detox is having to tell my boss and the stigma that could come from it. 
I was also thinking of just seeing my psychiatrist and asking for clonodine and visteral to help with taper. Neither are narcotics so I don't think it would be an issue but I don't know if she would be comfortable having be attempt to taper and detox without being monitored.
Any thoughts? Similar experiences?

2019-10-27 19:35:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/do0yvl/4_days_free/,4 days free!,"From 4 months up to 3.2gpd The first part of a taper you can go faster but just watch it. If the side effects are too much just slow your roll, stabilize for a few days and then try again by reducing less.

I got myself down to 1000 mg twice a day. From there I tapered 100mg a day. 50mg off of my morning dose and 50mg off of my evening dose. 100mg a day is considered a rapid taper but I was able to do it with very little side effects once I dialed in what I was able to tolerate. I tried 200 at first and it was horrible. A scale is absolutely essential. 

It took a while but I got down to 100mg twice a day! From there I took my last 100mg dose and skipped my evening dose. I thought that if I started to have anxiety or heart palpitations that I could just take the evening 100mg dose and stabilize for a few days and try again. I was even considering 100mg every other day if needed. 

Tapering too much is tapering  too much. I know the feeling - “I want to get out of this as soon as possible” is very prominent when we want to quit something, but this shit is downright dangerous.

I’m dealing with a tiny bit of muscle shakes but I need another few days under my belt to be able to tell if they are really subsiding like I think they should. I feel good about it though! 

Now on to the next thing - Kratom, a slower more drawn out bitch of a quit too but I’m determined. 

A few things I wanted to mention:

No matter where you’re at, you can do this. 

Getting help is not a failure on your part if you need it. 

Treat yourself as if you are taking care of someone you love, because you are. 

Get a good scale that measures 0.01 gram resolution. This is even more important as you get down to lower doses. The difference between 100mg and 200mg can be horrible. 

Consider NOT using helper meds that can be potentially harmful and addictive themselves. I had to go through THIS shit because I was using Phenebut to help me quit Kratom. Don’t stack multiple addictions. It’s not fucking worth it.",11
2019-10-27 14:18:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dnxb0f/nocturnal_seizures/,Nocturnal seizures,"Ok so I have recently posted about the multiple times a week I have been using Phenibut. At high doses I should mention close to 8.5 grams. I am not taking it daily but my birthday week I definitely used it about four times that week. So I stopped cold turkey the day before yesterday. I have gabapentin but it doesn’t do much to help. I have been on it or lyrica for years. I used to take seroquel to sleep at night but it started giving me nocturnal seizures so I went down and took it as needed. My sleep got better and I barely needed it and the seizures stopped, I am not taking it currently But have experienced nocturnal seizures the past three nights. I got one while on Phenibut two nights in a row and I got one the first night I stopped.  This freaked me out because I thought these seizures were directly related to seroquel. I’m hoping this doesn’t continue but I’m afraid I’ve given myself a permanent seizure disorder from all of the meds and substances I’ve been throwing at my body. I don’t know if a taper is going to be necessary but I’m just gonna try to stop and not take anymore and take my gabapentin daily. The first time I quit I had a grand mal seizure, the only one I ever had. The second time I quit cold turkey I did not have a seizure. So my question is has anyone experienced nocturnal or any type of seizure either while taking Phenibut or getting off it? Should I be going to the ER? I have had many nocturnal seizures in the past on and off phenibut but I think this irregular use of Phenibut and being in a state of almost constant rebound is triggering the seizures again. Halfway through day two and so far it’s completely manageable but I’m well aware that with phen’s long half life I may be in for a worse scenario tomorrow.
Hopefully not.. maybe since I didn’t take it daily it really won’t be that bad. I hope at least someone can learn from my mistake. Many of us simply cannot take Phenibut the right way. I tried and was doing well with once a week for a couple weeks and it immediately increased. Dosage and frequency both increased. I feel stupid and I’m super ashamed of myself but I’m hoping this is the end of my journey with this awful substance. I’m grateful I stopped it before I started taking it daily.

I'm dependent on this shit no doubt. I'm taking 7 grams every day right now, I've been diagnosed with a severe case of bipolar. That doesn't even do it justice, I have rapid cycling. If you don't know what that is, look it up on google or better yet watch a few videos of people under the effects of rapid cycling. I was/am a fucking idiot though because I knew my family had a history of severe mental illness (bipolar). I talked myself into using more because I was becoming more productive with phenibut than I was with kratom and weed. I don't know what it is about phenibut but it's perfect for productivity. Kept using more and more, and I just kept getting more and more work done.

I decided that college wasn't for me, I taught myself some ""higher"" level mathematics (linear algebra and up to basic differential equations, I was always good at maths), just recently started compiling TensorFlow and python to start studying machine learning (it always fascinated me but I never took the time to sit down to google shit up to write the code myself). I was working 12 hours a day (12 hours straight), to understand the material. I don't know what it was, was it the phenibut that shifted my perception to see the importance of education? I streamed on twitch before made some money, was into competitive gaming, but once I switched over to using phenibut it's like my reality completely unraveled and I thought to myself that computer science, mathematics, science, life itself is just a fucking video game. I know it sounds retarded I didn't even have an epiphany type moment that overwhelmed me. I just slowly slipped away from competitive gaming and slowly but surely educated myself via my own will and time over these past 7 months thanks to phenibut.

Despite this all, when I stop taking phenibut I become homicidal, delusional, feel as though I've been rigged like some alien is controlling me like I've got to be mentally insane to believe that I should feel joy. I start hallucinating random thoughts, random odors, random memories, I can't make up my mind. One minute I feel like I should give up and end it all the next I feel relief (the delusions almost always come in waves). My short term memory is spotty, some moments I've been so depersonalized and out of my mind that I had to shake myself back into reality. The auditory hallucinations don't really bother me, what bothers me is the huge shifts in my own perception of myself and reality (like I'm living in a fucking simulation. Ha, well I always have that thought but it becomes overwhelming true in my delusions).

Let's just say I fucked my brain up. Let's just hope that I didn't fuck it up permanently. I've tried slowly reducing my dose over these past 3 weeks but I keep tripping up. I'm going to just clench my fists and start the cold turkey journey tomorrow, I'll have my buddy keep an eye on me to make sure I don't kill myself. I don't think that's likely though, I just hope I don't kill someone.

I had the realization yesterday that I was a lot more fucked up than I had thought. I kept walking in and out of my room forgetting why I was walking into the room until I had a full-blown panic attack in frustration and concern thinking that I had done lost and fried my brain. It was beyond shocking and that was for sure my ""rock bottom"", realizing that I might be too far gone, in fear that I've permanently altered my brain to the point of no return.

&#x200B;

Update: Just took a 9-gram dose at 1:30pm (just kicked in as I write this update). This is my last experience. Bye, Phenibut. We might meet again but for the foreseeable future, we must drift apart. I just need to hop off of this roller coaster at a safe stationary location before I release the harness and plummet to my inevitable demise. But I'm still riding this roller coaster in my brain.

i get extremely hungry about every 3 hours and i need a full meal and it is fucking killing me. ive woken up out of my sleep every night this week at 3am deathly hungry aswell as sweating and all that shit. i feel so fatigued and just straight gross until i eat. my eyes sink in and i start to get a head pressure until i eat something. it’s seriously annoying dealing with this and i haven’t gained a pound either. i’ve never eaten nearly this much in a day in my life.

So I will share this crazy success story I now have of my own. 

&#x200B;

I think it's important to note that I am a large, in shape 25 year old man (6'5"" 225 lb) so maybe my dosage might translate to body sizes differently. I was taking phenibut daily for about a year. tried cold turkey at 3gpd and ended up getting one day shipping on a panic order and went straight back. When I was on 5gpd I tried tapering by supplementing with etizolam but I ended up abusing the etizolam and when I ran out of that I had to up my phenibut dosage to cope. This began a cycle of abuse and subsequent increase of phenibut dosage until I was around 10-12 gpd. things were going normal until I ran out of etizolam that time and I experienced what people on here call ""receptor death"". No matter how much I took I would only get like 1-2 hours of sleep per night and extreme anxiety and lack of appetite during the day. I had to drink copious amounts of booze just to sleep, which caused even more anxiety the next day. This continued for about 2 weeks until I was basically in a constant state of psychosis from lack of sleep. I almost killed myself with my bedside handgun (I have never had suicidal ideations before this). Instead I called my parents and told them I needed help. 

&#x200B;

So I checked into a dual-diagnosis center at a local hospital to detox. I brought my phenibut with me trying to tell them that I needed to taper or it would be dangerous for me. The first night all they gave me was 1mg ativan. obviously I did not sleep, I continued to not sleep for a couple more days and I experienced crazy ass scary auditory and visual hallucinations for a couple of days and then I honestly do not remember the next 4 days. Next thing I knew I woke up in my bed and heard that I tried to fight the biggest nurse in the hospital. They ended up strapping me to a bed and injecting me with things to put me out (not sure exactly what). But I miraculously began to feel normal and sleep unaided about 10 days after stopping cold turkey. I checked out of the hospital on day 12. I voluntarily entered a rehab facility immediately after because I have a long history of abusing drugs and alcohol; I decided enough was enough. I was constantly irritable and depression came in huge waves but I stuck it out. On day 40 of rehab I left the facility.

&#x200B;

Here I am on day 55 of quitting phenibut cold turkey from 12 gpd and my symptoms are quite mild. I do have anhedonia but it is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. My libido is still high, but not as high as my baseline usually is. The only medications I am currently taking are 10 mg lexapro and an antihistamine before bed. Exercise has helped me a lot and I believe being in good shape kept me from having seizures during the withdrawals. THERE IS HOPE, YOU CAN DO THIS!!!",18

I took 2.5 to 3 grams of phenibut a day for 3 weeks. I had used it semi-responsibly in the past 4 years but I've done these binges occasionally. I kept taking these high doses so I wouldn't be anxious on dates and didn't really think about it. Towards the end of the binge, tolerance had built up to where it hardly worked and I'm now tapering(1.5 grams a day).

I once found this girl to be perfect physically and found her energetic happiness to be extremely attractive. I thought I had no chance with her whatsoever and put her on a pedestal way way above me. Now that I'm off the phenibut high, and in withdrawal, I only find her annoying, physically unattractive, and boring. And yet, she is all over me, all the time. I have a strong desire to get away from her most of the time. 

The hyper-happy view that I had before is so different from the one I have now that all I can do is try and average out both perspectives to try and figure out what the reality of the situation is. Were my feelings for her all just delusions or just lustful feelings induced by the phenibut? Am I really going to blow up all my relationships by breaking up with her, and have everyone hate me? What if I regret it? I'm lost at the moment. More than anything, I feel awful for agreeing to be in an official relationship even when I was having second thoughts, its completely unfair to her.",9

- don't dose twice in 3 days. 
In my whole life I've dosed only 9 times.

- lots of wake ups trough the night (I have an oura sleep tracker ring)
- increased heart rate at night (70 instead of 50)
- headache,  like an alcohol hangover
- muscle ache, like an alcohol hangover
- wanting to just lay down and stare into the sky

My father passed away from brain cancer which started with headaches and blurry vision so it’s got me kind of concerned.

I’m going to see a doctor about it.

I have a lump on my upper right bottocks, it doesn’t hurt or anything, not even if i press on it. Could this be cancer? 
Also while having a massage (i have this massage seat for my back, tied to my armchair) when it comes to the middle of my back it hurts like fuck on my left side and it feels like something «wiggles» in there. Could THIS be cancer/a tumor?  

I’ve been to my doctor a couple of times, and I told him what I’m going through and he tells me it’s normal to experience a lot of weird sensations as my brain is adjusting to a new lifestyle and chemistry stuff. But i seem to always fear that he is missing something.. i realise how silly it sounds while writing it. But I just need to get it out. My head hurts a lot sometimes, like a «pressure headache» and the back of my neck up to my head is really tense, when i tilt my head backwards tho it feels relieving.. could all this just be stress-related?

It's become constant.

I usually Dodge the idea of quitting out of fear.  One interesting thing is that it seems to have morphed over the years.  When I first started taking it I remember feeling drunk and I was always laughing.  Now...my mood is completely dependent on it. In other words it feels like my dopamine is controlled by phenibut.  It doesn't give me social help or anything, actual I've become antisocial and I've been holed up in my room for the most part for the past 10 years.. mainly because there's no one i want to talk to but i hate that.

Couple things I'm wandering...

Does anyone else notice the dopaminergic effect more than anything?
Am i the only one who ended up being antisocial....
I think my biggest fear is that if i end up getting off it that i won't be the same person?
In other words I'm afraid that my  body won't ever produce the things that phenibut provided..

This is a throw-away account so I cannot be traced, but I have been looking at this form for a while.  I've allowed Phenibut to really ruin my life recently, and I want a way out.  I'll share my story below, but my question is how to find an addiction specialist who can actually work with Phenibut addiction.  It's not a well-known substance, its legal, and it's not something that most doctors would likely know about.  I looked up alcohol and drug rehab in my area, and it's all 12-step programs and Suboxone clinics. If you can share your recovery story, that would be appreciated. 

I have tried to taper, but every time I reduce my dose it gets bad.  I start having terrible anxiety and I cannot sleep.  I work in a high-stress job, and I can't go several weeks/months dealing with anxiety and insomnia.  I'm worried that cold-turkey at this point would drive me to psychosis and possible seizures.  I would like to swap over to a safer drug and taper off that.  Baclofen or gabapentin appear to be cited in the limited literature, but I don't know how to talk to a doctor about this.  If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear it.  Should I try a super-slow taper instead of a drug substitution?  Is Baclofen/Gabapentin easier to taper?

My story for those interested:

*I took Phenibut for the first time about 6 years ago.  I was able to use it in a healthy manner for several years.  At first, I would take 2 grams from time to time and never had any issues.  I first ran into trouble with it about 4 years ago when I started doing every day.  I eventually ran out and started withdrawing.  It took about a week, and I was back to normal.  The only real symptoms were insomnia and anxiety.  I eventually got a tub and continued to use it in a responsible manner for the next years, and dosed it very irregularly.*

*I was also drinking heavily for quite a few years.  I eventually decided to cut out alcohol and decided to use Phenibut to help me stop cold turkey.  It worked wonderfully!  I was able to stop a 16 drink/day habit with zero withdrawal symptoms by taking 2g of Phenibut daily.  I continued this 2g/day habit for over a year.  I never really felt the need to increase the dose.  2g/day was enough to help me through the day.*

*Then I started to get stressed out from some work stuff.  I dealt with it by upping my dose to 3.5 g/day.  The stress kept piling up, and I kept upping the dose.  In hindsight, the stress wasn't even that great.  The problem was my response.  I got into a habit of taking more and more Phenibut to deal with stress.*

*I honestly don't know how much I'm taking now, but I'd guess it is in the ballpark of 9-11 g/day. Phenibut has stopped working all day.  I used to dose once per day, but now I'll take several 3-4 gram doses, and a few hours later I'll have to take more.  I wake up every morning in a panic, drenched in sweat, anxious as hell until I get my first dose in.  I really need some help.*",5

Anyways I’m the guy from KC that was up to 14’grams a day. Well I finally quit fukin around and got a bad ass scale and in 3 weeks nice went from 10-12 gpd. Down to 4 gpd. I did use Xanax for a week but the fallout from that is I take to many and then want to steal and I can’t stand a thief. 
    So yea guys it’s been painless. I’m gonna chill at 4grams for a week or two then go down to 2gpd. 
   Biggest change that happened???
1. Get a good scale. Cheap and becomes addicting seeing how much u can drop 
2. Get a scale and find out u weren’t as bad as u thought u were. 
3. Get a scale and feel like your taking control back of  your life.

Thank God they didn't evict me, they just told me I couldn't have it while I stayed here. They know what it is and about withdrawals, so they told me if I start feeling terrible to let them know and they'll send me to their detox so I can come off it on (probably) Librium. I'm trying to avoid that as to avoid sick days at work and being stuck in a detox unit when all I really need is something to ease the anxiety. 

Thankfully, I have plenty of clonidine, but unfortunately just ran out of theanine. I have a long history with phenibut on and off for years now, masked withdrawals before with alcohol abuse, which is no longer an option as I'm serious about my sobriety. This time around I've only been on it daily for about the past month. I had definite withdrawal trying to stop a week ago, but one day in, so far, I seem to be coping alright. More depression than anxiety. I'm going home this weekend and I'm staying off caffeine, so I believe I'll get through this alright.

I used Phenibut for about 5 months now. Starting because I never had a problem with it before and to help me kick Kratom habit that’s been going on for about 6 months. (It worked but relapsed a few days later and right back to where I was) 

I think at my highest I was doing 3.2gpd but I’m down to .750 mg  or 0.75 g twice a day for weeks now. I tried dropping to 700 mg twice a day. Then the next day I would do 600mg twice a day but that was way too fast it turned out. I had super bad heart palpitations, muscle jerking, spasms, anxiety and generally feeling quite shitty. So I went back to 750mg twice a day for 4 days (feeling ok now again) and today I’m trying 700mg twice a day. 

In summary, how fast is too fast? How slow is too slow? I absolutely do not want to take Baclofen. I am already on Klonapin 1.5mg and I can take diazepam in the evening if I feel the anxiety is too much but don’t really want to add even more benzos routinely unless it’s absolutely necessary.

I am a substance abuser, and last year for me, when I first started taking phen it flipped my life around for the positive entirely. Amazing stuff. Then the tolerance monster came, and so began a year long, daily use with no break, with amounts getting up to 15gpd habit. And I knew I needed to get off it and cut down/take breaks, but there was always a reason not to; I'm meeting my parents, I have an important work thing, I have a party to go to etc etc. I couldnt find the time to take a week or so of feeling absolute shite and take a break/taper/get off it entirely. 


I used to lurk in here a lot while using, because I knew one day I'd be in here. So if you are a lurker, the timing to quit will never be ideal, get onto it ASAP and dont make it harder on yourself by adding months of use onto a withdrawal.

i kind of thought it was just a gabapentinoid and didn’t touch gaba receptors but i didnt look much into it because i wanted to believe it was a miracle drug. i’m also already prescribed 400mg gabapentin 3x day so thats why i was hoping it would be okay smh.

it wasn’t until last month until i realized how badly i fucked myself. i was taking 3gs for maybe 3 months then moved to 4 then switched to faa and didnt even measure it just scooped a lot into a energy drink and took hcl capsules with it. i only dosed once in the morning around 7am before work and by the time id go to sleep id be withdrawing. i’d wake up sweating and shaking after sleeping for 3 hours and just be in a weird state til i dosed. my dumb ass took so long to put 2 and 2 together, i was sleeping terribly for months but it wasnt til i wasnt sleeping at all and shaking through the night i realized i had a problem.

i started researching how to taper and decided to take off work that day and the next day so i could suffer then go to work a little better. i decided to off bat cut a gram off and only took hcl. i dosed 3 grams in the morning and in the night so i could sleep and that first day was so brutal. my anxiety was through the roof but luckily the 3gs stopped the shaking. i combatted this by going on long bike rides through nature and working out and doing anything but staying in my house because thats where i get most anxious. i slept a bit that night thank god but not very good, on day 2 it was basically the same as day 1. i went back to work and just dealt with it feeling symptoms of rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure it sucked bad because im a hypochondriac big time.

after a few days i stabilized and dropped another gram and got to 5 grams and it was brutal for a while i stayed there for 2 weeks and when i felt better i dropped 250mgs. that didnt really hurt so tge next day i dropped another 250mg and it hurt for a bit. i’m keeping a positive mindset through this and thank god am able to talk myself out of most of my anxiety but i still get lots of panic attacks i can sort of control them better though. i dropped another 250mg yesterday after 3 days on 4.5g. i’m now at 4.25g and it is pretty brutal right now. my anxiety isnt so bad but the heart palpitations and high blood pressure and rapid heart rate are annoying.

im hoping i can be off this shit by mid december before i go on vacation. it definitely sucks dropping that much at a time but working and being positive is helping getting me through it. i take gabapentin 3x per day but have been taking that for over a year so i dont know if its helping. i take ksm-66, L-Theinine, kava, and sometimes dose 2g of acetyl L-carnite in the morning that helps with a mood boost.

i know eventually i’ll have to do smaller drops but right now im liking the pace im going at and can’t wait to be off this shit. sorry if this was lengthy i hope all of you are doing well. any advice is appreciated hope we can all beat this shit",7

I first found phenibut in 2013. I began using 1gpd at night. I felt no other effects aside from deeper sleep which I enjoyed. I was able to jump off and on with seemingly no withdrawal. I was also taking a prescribed benzo. I stopped for awhile in 2016. About 2 months ago I started using again beginning with 5gpd. After about 2 weeks I ran out and suddenly was hit with 4 days of insomnia and terrible anxiety. Luckily, I was prescribed gabapentin, however my doctor did not like me on this rd and took me off. About two weeks later I decided to try and and cold turkey. After the fifth night of no sleep, I was psychotic and I chased ghost voices down the alley at 5am. Again, luckily my shipment came that very day. Three weeks later, last week, I was forced to spend 5 days in jail. I tried to curl up and stay sane. However by the 4th day I thought everyone in my pod was trying to kill me. I was shaking so bad that the fifth day, when I stood before the judge, my lawyer had the ask for a two week extension. One week later, today, I am looking at going to jail in about a month. I almost forgot, I am now using roughly 20gpd. I know taper, taper, taper but I have a month. I also have a family that I will lose if I try and say I'm addicted due to the previous alcoholic mess. I need a plan, some advice or even just some encouragement.",8

Recently, I’ve been noticing more side effects from daily dosing (shit memory, anxiety, depersonalization, etc) so I’m finally committing to tapering off this garbage. Bad sleep is probably the worst and most recent side effect that I’ve been dealing with. I’ll dose once in the morning before work at around 7:30-8am and then around 12am I’ll fall asleep fine but wake up at 3am with anxiety. I usually have to take an extra dose of kratom (which is a whole ‘nother can of worms that I don’t feel like dealing with atm) before I can go to sleep a hour later which is really fucking with my days. 

I’ve noticed that taking a small dose in the evening helps get me through the night. I was thinking about starting my taper with daily doses of 2.5g in the morning and 1g in the evening to counteract this. 

Thoughts? What’s the best way to go about this?",3

I posted my story and frequented this sub when I was coming off a 7 gram a day habit that lasted for a year and a half ish. I’m happy to say it’s nowhere near as bad this time. I am using phenibut 2-3 times a week .. originally I was sticking with 2-3 gram doses but now I’m back up to 7.5 grams 2-3 times a week. I usually take it one day and then take two days off, then take it again and so on. I feel pretty shitty on my days off as you can imagine. It feels like I’m constantly anxious, because  I am essentially  perpetuating a constant state of rebound anxiety. I ended up in the ER with chest pain the other day. I knew it was my anxiety but they wouldn’t let me go to a doctors office with those symptoms so I HAD to go to the ER. I have a script for gabapentin that I take on my days off phenibut. Unfortunately it doesn’t bring me much relief because my tolerance to it is insane. I  have been on gabapentin ( and for a few years lyrica) for the past 7 years. It pretty much has stopped working entirely due to tolerance, so I can’t see it  being much help. I plan to just stop cold turkey since I haven’t been taking it everyday. Or do you guys think I should stick with my schedule and lower the dose before I stop? I can’t imagine my withdrawal will be bad because I’m not taking it everyday but I guess I don’t know. I’m assuming when I go more than two days without it I’ll start to feel even shittier. I have to stop this before I end up on it daily again. I feel stupid- this started out as once a week and that’s what I planned on keeping it at, but failed. Fuck my addictive personality I’m over it. I will mention again I take Kratom daily and it helps a lot but I’ve also been on that for five years so the relief is minimal due to my tolerance. I will not take benzos. I’m in recovery from heroin addiction and I just don’t see that being beneficial at all.  I don’t feel safe taking a more addictive substance to get off phenibut. Who knows this may be pretty painless, my days off are rebound anxiety hell but I always make it through it’s not THAT bad. I’m just afraid that when I stop for over two days it’s gonna actually hit me. Do you guys think I’m fucked? Any suggestions would be great. I at least have the comfort of knowing it will not be as bad as last time. You guys are awesome thanks for the continuous support.",4

2019-10-07 08:54:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dej1cy/what_worked_for_me/,What worked for me,"I had been taking 1-1.5 gpd for a year or so, at night for insomnia, without knowing how addictive it was. Once I wised up, I did a slow taper to avoid withdrawal symptoms. It barely worked. I still got very depressed, irritable, had insomnia, fatigue, and a couple nightmares. The depression and fatigue started controlling my life, because I couldn't get anything done. I would sit on the couch all day, watching TV or just staring blankly. I felt too anxious to just walk outside of my house. I felt like a zombie. I've had depression in the past and never took medication, so this time I decided I wasn't just going to deal with it. Got a prescription for Wellbutrin, and it made a difference from day 1! I wasn't expecting any results for \*at least\* 2 weeks, and the doctor said it takes about a month to get in your system. It's like a switch has been turned on! I have calm, sustained energy \*\*ALL DAY\*\*, clear focus, and little to no anxiety. It makes me feel more functional and productive than I have in a long, long time. I'm still in awe of it, clearly.

Obviously Wellbutrin isn't the right choice for everyone, but I had to share with how well and quickly it made a difference for me. I felt like a shell of myself during the taper and up until I started the meds, so I'm thrilled to be getting back to normal.",3

I really want to quit.,"I have so many questions and have been reading posts, trying to wrap my mind around how to quit these drugs I have become addicted to.  I’ve been taking 5+ gpd of phenibut and 60 gpd of kratom for the past year and a half.  I dose 5-6 x per day, spread out evenly.  This is very approximate, I just ordered a scale so I can begin to measure and dose more accurately. 

My first question is, which should I taper first, or both?  If I go longer than 10 hours without both, I want to die, my depression is so great. I have bipolar, anxiety and obsessive/compulsive disorders. They got better for a minute while taking P and K,  but quickly became worse than ever... to the point that I can’t function normally (can’t work, manage my time, or even leave the house sometimes)...

My second question is, I have an appointment to see my doctor on Saturday, what should I bring him and are there meds I will need for this process, or is he even appropriate to do an outpatient medical detox/taper?  If not, should I be getting a referral to another doctor?  If so, what type?  From what I’ve read, baclofen and maybe a benzo?  I take Gabapentin already, but am only prescribed 200mg/day for back pain and anxiety. 

My third question is, should I even be attempting this on my own, or should I find a detox facility and, if so, what kind? I really have no idea what I’m doing here, but I feel like you all, in these subs, have the most relevant and helpful information. I just don’t know where to begin. 

I have time to taper, but can’t afford the Kratom I’ve been buying anymore, so I might need to taper that one first, although I’ve been told that Kratom helps with Phenibut withdrawal, which sounds like will be the worst of the two?  

Anyway, I’m just really overwhelmed and need some help getting a plan put together. I’ve been avoiding the whole quitting thing because it’s really confusing to me and I don’t know where to start. 

Thank you in advance to anyone who has any advice for me and I truly appreciate this forum and how helpful you all are.",2

I won't bore you with the details of how I became addicted to phenibut because we all have our own story as to how we got here. I will say that I was a daily phenibut user for about 11 months, and at the peak of my addiction I was using about 5-6 grams per day in one or two doses. I quit by SLOOOOWWWWLLLYYY tapering and supplementing with nootropics, kratom, and doctor-prescribed hydroxyzine to help with sleep. I'll list the details next.


Taper summary: I started my taper by cutting my daily dose straight to 3 grams. I was using 250mg capsules, so what I did was stay at a dose for about 7-10 days, then reduce my dose by one capsule and stay on the new dose for the same amount of time, etc etc, until I got down to 1 gram (4 capsules). Once I was that low, I stayed on each dose for two full weeks. When I got down to the point where my dose would be less than one capsule, I just eyeballed it and opened up a capsule and dumped a bit out into a container and took about 3/4 of a capsule for a week, 1/2 capsule for a week, 1/4 capsule for a week, and then nothing. Honestly, it was pretty easy for the most part.


Supplements: I took one capsule of fasoracetam (whatever the one cap dose from ND is) every evening for the entirety of the taper to help my GABA receptors adjust. I also took ashwaganda every morning and night to help with stress and anxiety naturally. I took curcumin with piperine as well, but I'm not sure if that had any impact on the phenibut taper. If I was feeling anxious, I'd take an extra ashwaganda with a nigella sativa capsule and it would help.


Kratom: Technically I'm addicted to kratom and I was before I even started phenibut, but I really don't care to be honest, I use kratom in place of coffee for the most part as a daily mood booster and anxiety reliever. Better than xanax I suppose. Kratom helped a ton and now that I'm off phenibut for good, I'll be cutting back on my kratom use, which for me is extremely easy to do. Please use your best judgment when it comes to that and don't assume I'm advising you to use kratom. Make that choice on your own.


But yeah, I felt inspired to write this because I just wanted anyone out there struggling to see another success story. I feel like myself and it feels great being free of the terrifying thought of ""what if I never really kick this shit?"" And also, by tapering so slowly, it was pretty painless- the worst of it was some mild sleeplessness whenever dropping the dose.


Good luck to anyone out there trying to quit. You can do it!

2019-10-01 21:26:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dc3b70/slow_long_taper_and_still_tough/,"Slow, long taper and still tough!","I started taking a 'natural supplement' with what my holistic doc said was an all natural amino acid, (yes, it was actually phenibut!) 4 years ago as a sleep aid. I took the supplement called Kavinace. No one ever said anything to me about dependence or withdrawl and I never used more than 3 capsules per day. Though I can't be sure the exact amount of phenibut was in this supplement as it was a mix of taurine and phenibut, but guessing that I was at around 1500mg daily at bedtime. For 4 years. I did not notice any adverse reactions during this time except that I lost a ton of weight due to frequent vomiting and doctors could not find any reason for my illness. Then the FDA banned Kavinace and I started doing some research into why...and found so much information on the real story of this 'supplement'. At first I was in denial that it could be causing my illness but as I started tapering I was noticing the withdrawl discomfort. All through the summer I attempted many times to taper down to just one capsule at bedtime (I was taking 3) with little to no success.

After finding this site among others I learned so much about getting off phenibut. I saw a doctor who thought Klonopin was the way to go...and perhaps it did help me initially lower my dose. I started taking a different source of phenibut called Gabatrol so I could better taper by 250mg instead of the Kavinace (which I couldn't buy anymore anyway!). I have had some pretty severe insomnia but it got worse once I got below the 1000mg mark. I waited about 11 days at 1000mg and dropped 250mg down to 750mg and since then it has been pretty hellish. At one point the doc let me try 10mg Baclofen (this was at the 1000mg point), which was awful for me, kept me up most of the night. When I dropped down to the 500mg the doc had me try Ativan which was equally horrific for me as the Baclofen. I had a slight success with 50mg of hydroxzine one night but it did not work the next night. 

For the past 5 days I have had a rough go I ended up in the ER this morning, just really exhausted and struggling. I opted to do an outpatient rehab and they gave me 2.5mg of Zyprexa to help me sleep until I see a new doctor on Thursday. Instead of going down another 250mg (it's been 5 days at 500mg) I opted to open one capsule and just empty a bit of the capsule and plain to taper that slow at least until the doctor gives me a better option. The lack of sleep is brutal. 

It seems some things have helped...I take PS100 everyday for lowering cortisol (no idea if its helping!?), L Theanine is in the supplement with the Phenibut. I also take Lithium Orotate (not a script) twice per day. My cousin is an herbalist and so I've used Kava, Valerian, Turmeric, Skullcap, and Lemon Balm. 

I just look forward to the day I feel normal again. It's overwhelming.",1
