I can handle the bad feelings. I feel like shit but it feels good because I know I'm going to get this shit out of my system.  I started using pheni again recently after being off for a year. Broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years and have spend the past two months across the continent from him, my family and everyone who loves me. I've been completely isolated in my 240 sq ft studio apartment high as fuck on phen the whole time and I haven't felt any feelings. Now that I'm coming off, I'm finally feeling all of the feelings I've been numbing and it feels really good. I've never been so happy to feel sad.

The bad feelings and the insomnia & the anxiety are just a symptom of being a human coming off of drugs. I can handle it. It's better than being in a weird semi-conscious Phenibut haze. It's 6 weeks of my life I'll never get back, but I'm ready to face my demons and power through",8,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.46435204}"

You guys offered so much support on my post last night and I am so incredibly thankful.

I've been spending the morning coming up with a plan on how to quit. My biggest question it, have any of you discussed phenibut with a psychiatrist? If so, how did it go, and is there anything to be worried about?

My biggest worry is that it will effect my ability to get a few of my current prescriptions. I am prescribed a low monthly supply of gabapentin and medium monthly dose of Adderall IR. It's easy enough to say that these are bad for me and I should leave them anyways. Indeed, in some of my replies I mentioned adderall has caused me great troubles with anxiety in the past. However, these drugs have still provided genuine help at times, and I am afraid of being cut off from it entirely. I may have over-used Adderall as a handicap to replace discipline in the past, but it's undeniable that responsible use provided legitimate support for my ADD and my ability to function both in class and at home.

I'm afraid that opening up about about my addiction to one drug will discourage my provider from continuing to prescribing any drug that has the danger to be abused. Worst of all, I wouldn't want to be labelled as ""drug seeking"". From my understanding, such a label would severely and permanently limit my ability to get any sort of controlled substance in the future. I remember anecdotes from other redditors saying they were denied painkillers after going through a difficult surgery. A few years ago I had an invasive surgery that left me in a wheelchair for 3 months. The only way I managed to survive the pain was a low dose prescription of oxy taken until my bones could heal.

What are your thoughts? Am I over worried, are are my worries misplaced? thank you in advance for any advice you guys can provide.",1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.50653756}"

It's about the same now as it has been all week and i'm wondering if it's due to the phenibut.

I wanna open by thanking you guys for creating this community. I hope to message on here as I go through my process of quitting and try to provide support for people going through the same thing.

I underestimated the effect this substance would have on me. I spent about 3 months talking 1-3 grams  on the weekends, trying to make my 25g tub last as long as I could. Near end of the 3rd month, I started taking about 1-3 grams everyday, telling myself I'd be forced to withdraw by just not buying any more for a while. Fortunately, I didn't end up experiencing any withdrawal symptoms and I continued on with my life as normal.

This time is different. I wanted to save money, so I bought the larger 125g tub since the price per mg was nearly half compared to the 25g tub. I kept telling myself I'd somehow conjure up the discipline to hold off my urges and only take it on the weekend. However, when it arrived, things quickly changed. My history of substance use had always been curtailed by either money or prescription. I'd never have enough to build up a tolerance or experience withdrawals. However, when this tub of phenibut came in, everything changed.

Suddenly, I had an effectively infinite supply of my drug of choice. Within days I was up to 3-4g. Sometime in the first week I took a generous dose with adderall, and after an hour I felt better than I had in years. I refilled my gabapentin prescription and starting taking 300 mg along with my now regular nightly dose of 1-3 g Phenibut. It was bliss.

The worst part of all of this is that it's really helped me. Most of this quarantine I've just sat in self-pity, putting off everything I needed to do just to play video games and feel bad about myself. But these past weeks, I've done so much for myself. I've gotten in contact with my professors to arrange my thesis for next year. I've gotten back in contact with friends that I was too nervous to respond to. I've been consistent with a complicated skincare routine for the past two weeks. Just this week I've worked nonstop contacting realtors and filling out applications, and just today I managed to do what I thought was impossible and successfully rent a house despite being late to the game in an incredibly competitive market. Maybe the biggest of all, I felt comfortable flirting with a cute guy, *and he thought I was cute too!* I have *never* had the courage to tell someone I liked them like that, much less had someone reciprocate that affection.

Ultimately, I'm just scared. I'm really scared that once I stop I'll lose all of this progress and go back to where I was. That I'll go back to drinking at night to fall asleep and wake up feeling lost in life. This all feels like a silver bullet, but I know it won't last. I've read the horror stories, the depression that comes from stopping, and the tolerance that'll lead to people taking more and more. The past few days I've lowered my evening dose of phenibut slightly to add in a glass of wine. That means I'm taking gabapentin, phenibut, and alcohol all in the same night. I down-play the risks in my mind because I'm terrified of my life without it.  I've masked my anxiety and mental anguish with a dangerous habit of self medication.

I'm just scared. I want to love myself without this drug, and I'd be lying to myself if I said the current path I'm on is healthy.

The nightmares were so unbelievably fucked up. The worst part of it was how “real” it seemed. 

One of the worst symptoms I experienced during withdrawal was the close eyed hallucination visuals.  At one point, I thought I had gone insane. It honestly felt like a terrifying Shrooms/acid trip with some physical symptoms thrown in.  These withdrawals came in windows and waves too. I would feel completely fine for 2 hours, then would be in a world of hell for 4-8 hours.  Then 2-3 hours of feeing fine, then the wave hit and rinse and repeat. 
I’m not saying this to scare anyone or share or “horror story.”  I’m merely sharing my experience, strength for pushing through and not looking back, and hope for the others out there who want to be done with this substance.

I went into the mindset that phenibut is better than doing than meth, benzos, opiates, and various other stims. But it wasn't any better than my stimulant addiction.

Just have to share this with anyone out there thinking there’s no end In site or permanent damage has been done. If anything this shows how unpredictable this shit is. After almost a year and a half of a crazy ride on this shit I am 100 percent off of it now. It’s been over a week off and I feel fine. Not great but just my normal shitty self. For months when I was actually feeling this shit I was taking 14 grams a day and loving it. Wow everything was so bad ass during that brief amount of time but like every other drug it stops working. During that time I had several days of total sleep walking and not remembering any of it. Came to several times setting out in my truck in my underwear thinking i was going somewhere. It got pretty bad. 
       Normally a taper off anything would be out of the question because I’m so all or nothing on shit but the wds from this shit has me scared so bad a taper was possible. I dropped straight to 7 gpd and didn’t notice any difference so just kept dropping like a gram every two weeks. I did add 1 baclofen 10mg every evening and slept fine.
       I think the biggest time I had trouble was the 3 weeks or so I dropped from 2grams to 1gram a day but I went back up to 1.5 and sat there for a month then dropped. Then a few weeks ago I realized there were actually days I forgot to take it. Started going every other day and then just stopped. Really have no idea how this time I’m fine because I have experienced true fukin panic and other shit I assumed was wd from this shit. 
      Anyways don’t stop a taper your doing good on and just quit or anything but keep going and put this shit in the past.

I logged every dose of Phenibut that ive ever taken, and all other drugs for the last 10 months. I never used more than a gram in any day. My average dose is 500something mg per day over the last 4 months.

My daily use started when I got a massive panic attack after using a small dose of a research chemical benzo. The morning after the horrible night I used 1g of phen because it was the only dose that helped. From there I tapered down 50mg/d for about a month and got clean for 10 whole days!

Then I decided to give that RC another try and the same thing happened all over again. Now I am stuck at 600mg. The taper went great until 400mg, when I had a panic attack and went to 600mg. Then I had a panic attack there aswell and went to 800mg last night.

For the past year or so I’ve had a rather healthy relationship with Phenibut. I’d order a very small amount at a time and use it maybe 2-3 times a month. I’m not sure what possessed me to order a larger supply about a month and a half ago. Perhaps it was my desire to try and quit kratom. To date, I have used approximately 1-3g sporadically a few days per week for the last month in a half. I wish I could be more specific than that but I haven’t paid close enough attention. 4 nights ago I had a massive panic attack at night and thought it was odd. I managed to get some sleep and took pheni the next day. I did not dose until this morning around 6 am where I was greeted with another massive panic attack. I took 1/2 a g and it took symptoms away. Crap, I realized to myself that the panic attacks where indeed from the Phenibut and I now appear to be on the hell train. I just got out of my doctor’s office and tried to get Gabapentin which she did not want to prescribe me and just told me to take 1/2g three day’s in a row, and then a 1/2g every other day for 3 doses after that, so that by next Wednesday I could quit completely. Does this sound right? Sorry if I explained my situation poorly, I’m slightly distraught right now.

 Dosage:

I was taking pretty high doses, like 2.5 the highest I took was 3g, that day I had taken about 2.1 g then redosed for a total of 3 grams. Waited one day, then took 2.4 grams after that and just felt anhedonia kicking in as I was on it. Total lack of motivation, energy, enthusiasm. 

Currently:

Today is the 5th day completely off of phenibut, I don’t really feel the lack of motivation or any anxiety whatsoever. Just a total neutralness, lack of feeling and excitement. I don’t even get anxious anymore in situations I normally would. Having trouble sleeping, also took gabapentin and it practically has no effect on me anymore, as if I didn’t take anything. Took 3 grams of kratom as well. I don’t feel any real negative side effects, I just want to be myself again. I want to feel everything, anxiety even, at least it reminds me I’m me. 

How do I do this: 

I want my emotions back. What do I do? How do I repair my brain chemistry. 
Can I upregulate glutamate or whatever the neurotransmitter is that will make me normal again? I’ve heard fasoracetam helps as well as magnesium citrate. Again I have no anxiety so all I want is supplements that will treat my brain chemistry to bring it back to normal. 

Update : It’s been 7 days since taking phenibut. I feel perfectly back to normal again. Except for one aspect, I feel my gaba receptors are overtaxed in some way maybe. Every time I take gabapentin it seems to stimulate me less. Almost not at all. I took 800mg earlier today and now, even though I should be very tired and sleepy... I even took sleep aid liquid, resemblant to NyQuil and don’t feel sleepy at all. Feel a numbness at the front of my brain. Don’t feel sleepy what so ever.

L-theanine & benadryl are helping me sleep, but i've had the most incredible nightmares & often I can't tell if I'm asleep or not.

There were all kinds of grubs & maggots in my apartment & the human-scorpion bugs were killing and eating them. I tried spraying one of the huge scorpion bugs with an insect killing spray & it came after me, crawled up my leg & bit me in the ankle. It latched on so hard & it was so strong that I couldn't pull it off of me. I had to use a sharp knife to sever its head off so it finally died. Then I gathered everything I needed to leave the apartment & when I walked out, my building had transformed into a really fancy movie theater with soft lighting and marble walls. There were tons of people in the hallway who were walking into the movie theater. I've been worried about Covid in my dreams lately aso I realized that no one was wearing a mask so I went back into my apartment  to  get one. When I walk back into the hallway, a woman comes running down the hallway, yelling ""EARTHQUAKE!"" I live in southern california so that is a real possibility. In the dream I though, ""How does she know there's an earthquake? We can't predict those."" I left the building anyway because the yelling woman seemed really serious about it. Then I woke up.

Please tell me your experiences :),"TLDR: using 40-60mg faso per day for past 3 weeks during taper seemed to help. Will pause tapering for one week while on family holiday. What happens if I drop faso? Will I get pheni WD if I stop taking faso even though my pheni dose remains the same? 

Longer version: 
I’m still tapering, just got to 400mg/d (split as two 200mg doses). So I’m in the absolute final stretch of tapering off almost 3 year daily use ranging 3.5-5.5gpd. Definitely got harder tapering below 1gpd, but managed to push through so far. I should be stable at 400mg/d after the weekend or so.

Soon I’m heading on one week family holiday. Although I was very tempted to jump CT from 1gpd before and tough it out, that still wouldn’t have given enough time totally off phenibut and stabilized before leaving. 

So I figured it’s better to stick to a stable low dose of 400mg for that week and continue the last bit of tapering when I’m back. 

FYI: I use phenibut powder for taper (with 0.000g scale) which is silly for traveling/stealth dosing. I have a small supply of 200mg pheni capsules left, just enough to cover me at 400mg per day. So also remove the risk of ‘accidentally’ increasing while on holiday by having the exact amount. 

If I were to stop taking Faso for a week or so during this holiday, I would still have enough left to finish my full taper plan (and then taper the fasoracetam itself over 1-2 weeks). So no need to order more. 

What is the likelihood of dropping Faso CT causing a major increase in phenibut WD? I know there are no studies/peer reviewed info out there. So wondering about different quitters and their Faso experience? I read a couple reports of people who had some phenibut-like WD after quitting faso. Anyone wanna chime in on their experiences if taken for a longer while?

I have CT before off it and it was Living hell, did the first 3 days by myself and then a few at a detox facility as my doses were astronomical.

So I am currently at hour 72 and have, mild tremors / dizziness feeling out of it in general. I have been taking 1mg etizolam and 3x300mg gabapentin each day. I have slept like a baby every night too, My question is, its currently past the three day mark and I am laying in bed and keep dozing off... Would the gabapentin cause that at low doses? It could be the kratom too but I've been taking that for a year so i doubt it.

\*\*\*UPDATE \[7/18/2020\]: Well, I am almost 4 days in at noon today and last night I slept perfectly, again. I got 9 hours of sleep. Not sure what is going on but I highly doubt the real withdrawals will hit at 96 hours... I have definitely been feeling really off, shaky and dizzy but other than that, no anxiety, no impending doom like last year. Just gabapentin. I said in a post last year I will never touch this stuff again but I was stupid and let job interviews stress me enough to go back to this. This time I am sticking with sobriety because I always spiral out of control, fast. I am considering myself really lucky and not tempting fate ever again. I will still be lurking around this sub just to give some input but I absolutely am NOT going back to this stuff again. It has made me a neurotic and anxious mess. Thank you for everyone's input.

\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE: I definately still felt off this morning and super dizzy, had to take 200mg phen to drive to get a covid test. After that wore off I am feeling better but still off. I have another 7 days off of work while i am quarantined & just found out that this awesome detox place will cost me literally $0 with my insurance, so why not jump ship from Kratom, the remainder of phenibut and my half month use of etizolam as well to make sure I can get my sleeping schedule right. I will probably be going tomorrow or monday. I will keep updating, again if anyone is still reading!

LAST UPDATE\*\*\* 5 Days in: Still no significant withdrawals, I slept 8 hours again last night with only a tiny bit of etizolam and nightly gabapentin 2 hours before bed. I just realized it wasn't the gabapentin that was making me dizzy... it was my freaking kratom. So no more of that! Thanks for everyone's input, and again, good luck to you all!

Im no expert by any stretch but I’m not new to supplementing vitamins. I utilize many to lead a healthier lifestyle but this has me floored.

A quick history.
Ive been battling with opioid addiction for the better part of ten years now. The last two on and off kratom. So I got myself in a bit of a pickle. I recently discovered the wonders of phenibut while tapering down from 180gpd kratom. Short and sweet it worked I enjoyed every min of my taper and I’m down to 60 gpd kratom. But at the same time I climbed the phen gram ladder really quickly and got myself a new dependence In The sum of 10gpd phen.

At this point phenibut turned on me in a bad way I started getting panic attacks no matter what I did up down stay the same less frequent more frequent nothing Made a difference what I realized is it’s time to get off this train. So I have been tapering 50 mg a day and back off If I needed to. Even with a slow taper I can feel those small drops and in constant anxiety. I have tapered Dow to 7.5 gpd feeling this way the entire time.  If your on here you know the wall of anxiety and panic that can ensue when even dropping 100mg. 

So I scoured the internet trying to find something helpful. I even ordered baclofen for when I get low enough in my taper to make the switch fast taper off that and be done with this chapter of my life. 
I read this Interesting case report on the use of high dose niacin for long term low dose benzo withdrawals.
Here’s the link to the report
[niacin benzo case report](https://www.townsendletter.com/Oct2016/benzo1016.html)https://www.townsendletter.com/Oct2016/benzo1016.html

I thought to give a low dose niacin a try to see if it would mitigate my anxiety and panic and I was absolutely floored! Gone are the nights of franticly walking the streets of my neighborhood at 3am. The past two days When I feel the anxiety creeping in I have been taking 125 mg of niacin and almost immediately my anxiety is gone! now you need nicotinc acid with flush. I purchased mine from gnc
https://www.gnc.com/vitamin-b3-niacin/254115.html
Not b complex not flush free has to be nicotinic acid or it won’t do anything.

What I feel when taken. 
Almost immediate anxiety relief then skin gets hot beet red and itchy what they call niacin flush completely normal don’t freak out. this will eventually stop happening with daily use.
In the past I have consumed upwards of 10 grams of niacin  in a day while withdrawing from opiates completely safe in my opinion but do your own research. I also feel as it potentiates my phen dose get a fantastic buzz actually so be careful on how much you take. I started low, I cut the 500mg tablet in quarters and took 125mg and wow! I’m considering making a large drop in my phenibut use and up my niacin intake and see how I respond I will keep you posted if I do so this weekend.

I have dropped over a gram of phenibut with zero and I mean zero I’ll effects and down to 42 grams of kratom a day. no withdrawals what so ever! In the past if I dropped 300mg I feel as if I’m about to loose my mind. That’s a gram in less than a week! 
Currently at 6.4 grams per a day! I will keep updating progress and plan to drop 400mg tomorrow and that’s with two children and a full time job as a business owner.

I’m impulsive, part of my problem but anyway I decided to drop a gram yesterday and did! total phenibut intake was 5.4 grams and zero withdrawals! as of today I will chill on 5.4 for a couple of days and then continue my taper. Will update! Take care comb your hair.

I began taking phenibut December 2018 right after I started ridesharing, around the same time I before I started with benzodiazepines and eventually found cloanzepam and started running at least 10k every night and 1/2 marathon every so often.

I moved to Colorado and my dosage increased to 2g of phenibut daily, when I got ready to move back to Colorado I met my Fiancé who I now live with in Minnesota.

When I first started taking phenibut with cloanzepam I found that it helped a lot better with all my anxiety, inflammation, find a stable job I love and it made me socialize and make connections a lot better, eventually I stopped taking cloanzepam from 2mg.
I wouldn’t have put myself out there and found my fiancé without phenibut so I’m glad for that.

Now today every morning I take 7.5 to 8 grams of phenibut, 300mg of lamotrigine, fish oil, zinc and every so often 1/4 to 1/2 mg of cloanzepam, 
I also recently started taking adrafinil to combat the sedation phenibut gives me later in the day.

Sometimes at night if we go out I’ll take another gram to 2g

Life is really good, I can work like never before, my Fiancé and I have plans and are doing great.

However I know something needs to change because of the way my body withdrawals after stopping a dose for a day.
I completely change, shut down, lay in bed, don’t think about eating, shake and get tremors, get extremely moody, have terrible thoughts and at the end of the night I cannot sleep at all and feel like my heart will stop.
It was too the point where 2mg of cloanzepam would make the withdrawal subside and be sore to sleep.

I don’t know how much and how often to taper from this dosage. 
I need help and not just for me but for the love of my life and family, when I withdrawal it reminds me of the person I was before I took cloanzepam and phenibut which is terrifying, I dread on how it would effect me relationship and in general.

This is about my 3rd or 4th stint with Phenibut withdrawal. At my height, I was at 4-5GPD for approx. 3 months straight this round. Due to the lessened inhibitions on Phenibut, I ended up relapsing on opiates as well. I used opiates in combination with Phenibut for approximately 2 months. This was a major blow as I’m in therapy at this time but couldn’t bring myself to tell my psych out of fear I’d be cut off from my Klonipin taper. What a mess, right? 

So altogether, I was using 3 substances: Phenibut, Klonipin, and Opiates. The first thing I did was get rid of the most damaging substance to my daily life with were the opiates. I scheduled a week off of work and essentially jumped cold turkey with the help of Kratom. I kept Phenibut and Klonipin relatively steady during this time (only minor drops on Klonipin with the help of my doc). Once I got off the hard opiates, I stayed on Kratom for a month and was able to get off with relatively minor issues. I had a couple weeks to fully rebound but the main symptoms were sneezing, bloating, loose stools, and cravings. 

After I cleaned myself of opiates for the umpteenth, I decided Phenibut is next. I began tapering by dropping ~500mg HCL/week powder and replacing it with a 250mg FAA capsule. Technically this is a drop of 250mg a week but getting off the HCL was more of a concern to me as the FAA is easier to taper. Fast forward about 4 months of steadily tapering around this schedule, I’m now down to 1G Phenibut/day. I don’t experience anything too noticeable when I drop my dose. It is a bit uncomfortably for approx 3 days or so with some rebound anxiety but not unbearable. After this week, I will be at 750mg Phenibut. And plan to be off by the end of month. 

Something that has helped me slowly but surely is talking to a professional about antidepressant treatment. I have a history of talking to my counselor about depression which is the root cause of all my
abuse through self medicating. I’ve been prescribed Lexapro which has been pretty instrumental to getting me through these finally pushes. 

Just from my own experience, I want to say that I’ve noticed continually gradual improvements after being on lexapro. The first week is rough and I slept a lot and was out of it. After the first week I noticed that I wasn’t stuck inside my head so much and it was easier to let the little things go. 

If you suffer from depression/anxiety prior to any self medication through Phenibut, opiates, etc.. I personally recommend seeking antidepressant treatment. My cravings for more Phenibut and opiates have essentially diminished. I feel more like myself and feel healthier physically. You don’t need to be on antidepressants forever but they may help you to get a solid footing on your life (in combo with therapy as a bonus) to a point where you can figure things out then ween off the meds. 

I’m still working on the Klonipin taper but it’s been slowed down drastically due to COVID. Anyways, just wanted to throw this out there as a possible option to people who may be struggling.",8,{'covid': 1},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5518658}"

I might just have to give up.,"Everything about this goddamn chemical and addiction to it is unbearable, to say the least. I cannot take these nightly withdrawals. The anxiety, shaking, racing heart, doom thoughts, insomnia, everything about it is just so brutal, and it's hitting me hard every single night now. 

The crazy part? I have not even lowered my dose in over two weeks! I have no idea what happened/is happening, but I have maintained my 3gpd schedule for bare minimum two weeks. It feels like there's no escape anymore. If I can't even stave off withdrawals even by just maintaining my dose, where the hell am I supposed to go from here? It seems like I've exhausted my options here.

As I type this, I'm in my nightly withdrawal. I'm shakey, having doom thoughts every 15 seconds, and my heart is pounding so, *so* hard. It's 3am currently, and honestly, I feel like I don't even need to spell it out that trying to sleep has been absolutely impossible. I've been having to use benzos a lot as a result of this, and god knows those aren't doing me any favors in the long term. But I don't have access to any tonight, so I just have to sit here in miserable shape doing nothing.

I need professional help so desperately bad, but that itself seems to be another impossible goal. The first place I tried ended up telling me that they only allow cold turkey, no tapering. I had been really banking on this place, so as a result of that falling through, I lost like a month by waiting until I got in to attempt tapering. I called a second one around a month ago, too, and they told me that there's a month long wait list. Radio silence so far. Out of desperation, I even asked my GP, and all I got was a list of psychiatrists and addiction specialists that I already knew about. It is fucking infuriating how difficult it is to get this non-reacreational, non-addictive medication that could literally save my life right now.

For a very long time, I had planned on killing myself because of phenibut. I figured I would just never be able to get off it myself, and I had absolutely fuck all to live for or look forward to in life. A couple months back, though, an opportunity feel into my lap that could've finally given me a normal, decent life for the first time in my adult years. Things finally would've started to heal, but honestly, I really wonder if it's too late. I have one month to not only kick 3gpd, but be recovered enough to function like a normal human being. How am I supposed to do that if I can't even simply *maintain* my dose? At this point I'm just really feeling like I'll never be able to live a substance free life, it's all gonna fall through, and I'm gonna be back to square one, as detailed in the beginning of the paragraph.

Anyway, I just needed to vent, so if you're still here, thanks for listening. My anxiety actually lowered noticably as I wrote this. I know it isn't helpful or productive at all for the sub as a whole for me to go on a rant like this, but it did help me, so again, thanks for that.

Also, a couple quick notes for anyone who may want to give advice:

-Yes, I'm aware of the way phenibut ""turns on"" people and causes lots of side effects, which many people here theorize to be ""glutamate surges"". I'm very familiar with them. I've been dealing with them for months, sometimes to pretty extreme levels. I am 100% confident this is not that. What I've been putting up with lately feels very distinct.

-For whatever reason, these withdrawals are only happening at night. I have yet to get a bad one before 10pm or so. It's really bizarre. Clearly there's something going on, but since I take a dozen different chemicals in addition to other lifestyle choices, I have no way of pinning it down to a single one.

-Speaking of which, those chemicals are phenibut, kratom, lamotrigine, gabapentin, memantine, nac, fasoracetam and alpha-gpc, as well as some that theoretically shouldn't affect my brain in the slightest.",9,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9517812}"

For the past while now, maybe around two or two and a half weeks, I have been getting withdrawal symptoms every single night and I don't know why. I get that it's *possible"" that I'm just psyching myself into a plain old panic attack, but I don't think that's the case. For one, I've never been one to have random full on panic attacks, especially ones to this degree. Another point to add is that .25mg of alprazolam dulls the anxiety a bit but it's still very much there. But, honestly, my main evidence for thinking it's substance induced is just the subjective feeling of it. I doesn't feel like a normal panic attack to me, it feels like a phenibut one.

Anyone have any ideas as to what's going on here? I seriously have to clue where to go from here. Like I said, it's been over two weeks, so I doubt I'm just in one of those stabilization phases. 

Honestly, I feel like I'm just out of options at this point. I have one month to completely quit and yet I'm here not even being able to stay at the same fucking dose without withdrawling. I want professional help so bad, but I'm still waiting for the call back from the addiction clinic, and even if/when I get, they're probably gonna have no idea what I'm talking about and I'll end up guiding them more than they guide me. More so than anything, I just can't take this primal fear that these panic attacks are causing anymore. That sheer terror, that feeling that the worst possible thing is about to happen to you, yet you don't even know what that thing is. I just cannot take it anymore.

I felt more positive the the first two days after getting off, and have been having anxiety on and off and just feeling weird since. Almost like a weird panic feel, mainly during the day. I take multivitamins, eat, L theanine and such but I just can’t shake the weird feeling. I’ll take tiny chunks of gabapentin, like 50mg and it’ll usually make me feel better but it occasionally makes my eyes n stuff feel bad. 

I have this weird seizure anxiety, I’m not prone to them and not worried about having one from lack of phenibut but it’s just weird. Anyone else felt like this? I’m much better then I was last weekend by far, but I’m not healing as fast as I thought I would be since I jumped off at such a low dose. It’s like I’ll have this weird “ anxiety and this pressure in my head and my vision is a little weird, at least when I start having anxiety, and when it gets “bad enough,” I have to get out of my house and walk/drive around. I was fine at work all week, but being at home today has been  a tad rough.

My main issue is as I type this, I can’t stop thinking that something is about to happen to me physically. That’s a main symptom of anxiety I guess but it’s just shitty.

2020-07-11 14:36:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/hpf4wc/the_logarithmic_taper/,The logarithmic taper,"Hi all. I made a reply in here which involves an idea which I hadn't really thought of nor had I seen passed  around anywhere. So basically, the idea is to do the regular taper, typically to 300mg or less, and then a lot of people hit a roadblock. Some people cant find a scale with that level of precision. Some people have a hard time going cold turkey off of that last dose. But I have a solution, I think to both of these problems.

So what you're gonna want to do is aquire a graduated cylinder and a pipette. The size doesn't hugely matter, but you're gonna want at least 10mL, maybe up to 50 depending on how slowly you want to do the taper or how accurate you want it to be.

Instrictions:

1 if you're dosing 300mg, load 10* that dose or 3g into the graduated cylinder. Fill the remainder of the cylinder with water and stir carefully with a long rod.

2 Take a 1mL pipette and carefully remove 1mL of the solution, to be added to a drink for dosing. This will contain 300mg.

3 Rinse with baking soda water to prevent enamel loss

4 This is the key part and what makes it logarithmic. With the same pipette, take 1mL of tap water and replace the solution in the graduated cylinder

5 repeat from step 2 once per day.

The point of this is each time you add water, you reduce the dosage to 90% of the previous day. By day 45 you will be dosing at 1% and at that point you should be able to drop it entirely. 

You could even use this method for your whole taper, but you would need a large cylinder to hold a lot of phenibut. 

DISCLAIMER: this method is for people who are already daily users trying to quit. If you aren't a daily user, dont start, it's not worth it. Step 3 is not strictly required, although it is strongly recommended, you can also do this if you vomit to prevent enamel loss.",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.5773152}"

Today I took 10mg of baclofen only, felt nothing (wasn't chasing a high but was looking for ""relief"", took  25mg and again nothing...I also did 90 minute gym workout and ran 3 kilometers and still felt awful so I took 400mg of Gabapentin X 3 and now I feel like I'm on drugs but it's not nice and I'm trying to quit all this shit 

I sit here feeling confused and spaced out and just feel like shit

So, I’m super new here (with an account, at least) but I have been trolling these pages for a couple of months trying to muster up as much info as I possibly can to help me put my phen addiction behind me. I know how irresponsible I got with it & I honestly have no clue how it got the point that it did but at the end I was maxed out at 17gpd for about 4 months, which got me through the day but I couldn’t carry on like that. I knew it was destroying my insides, my gaba receptors were obviously fucked and I was afraid to travel or get into a relationship and have to hide this bullshit from her or come clean about the nonsense I was having to put into my body just to maintain. Also I was having very frequent panic attacks out of complete nowhere, I’d get kind of irritable & all around resentful for lil to no reason and I was depressed/worried a lot of the time towards the tail end of the day. Mood totally unpredictable. So to cut to the chase, after asking my psych multiple times for Baclofen just to have him turn me down & eventually tell me I’d have to see a neurologist or go to the ER, I ordered 60 ten mg tabs off the darkweb & have more 25mg tabs on the way from ADC. I also have gabapentin on hand (1800mg 2x a day). So the first day off the phen, I took an unhealthy amount of gabapentin just to kickstart everything (roughly 6000mg). Then, day 2 I took my normal dose of gabapentin at 1800mg in the morning along with 20mg of Baclofen & did the same in the late afternoon/early evening. Fucking cake walk. 3rd day I did the same thing, cake walk. Now, I’m on day 4 and did the same thing and so far, so good. I’m astounded that such a minimal dose of Baclofen has been able to get me by since they say 10mg of Baclofen is equal to a gram of phen but I’m assuming the Baclofen is taking care of my gaba-b receptors while the gabapentin is taking care of my gaba-a’s & calcium channels so I’m hopefully just getting the best of both worlds. I plan on staying on this regiment for no more than 3-5 more days (since I may start to get low on my stock of Bac) and then taper 5mg a day off that & just stay on my dose of gabapentin. Unless the neurologist I see in about 5 days will prescribe me Bac, in which case I’ll stay on it an extra week or two and have a medically monitored taper, just to be safe & comfortable. If you’re struggling with Phen dependence and feel like it’s never gonna end or don’t have the self control to taper, PLEASE do yourself a favor and do what you can to try this combo. I lived in constant fear that I’d never put that shit behind me but for the first time in months, I have SO much hope. Sorry for the rant but I really hope this helps someone that was in the same position & I’ll keep you guys posted with updates as the days go by. I feel like a lot of people that have had success getting off phen with these meds don’t feel the need to come back to these threads because they’ve put the shit behind them but everything I know about phen & how to battle this monster, I learned from you guys so I feel like it’s the least I can do to try to help someone out that may be scouting for answers or a glimmer of hope.

2020-07-07 18:23:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/hn4jps/my_phenibut_story/,My Phenibut story,"Just wanted to make a post documenting my experience with (and ongoing addiction to) phenibut. I want to touch on: 

- How I got addicted
- How it effects me
- How those effects have changed throughout these 14 months
- My dosages, and
- My taper

So it all started April 23, 2019. Actually, let me back up before that and explain a few things about me. I’m 27, male, no major health issues. On April 23, 2019 (the day I started phenibut) I was 25. I was already (and still am) a Kratom addict. I have been taking approximately 15 grams of kratom daily for around 4 years. I also take adderall fairly regularly - *almost* everyday. I do not, however, consider adderall to be a “major” addiction, simply because if I run out, it’s not an *emergency*.

So anyways. It’s around mid April of 2019, and I’d been doing a lot of research on Phenibut. As someone who struggles with social anxiety, and has spent their entire life inhibited by a general feeling of discomfort in public interactions, it’s effects intrigued me. I also found the *ease* by which I could obtain it to be very attractive, as benzos were extremely hard to come by.

It only took me about an hour of researching its effect profile to decide it was something I wanted to try - the rest of my research was focused on the withdrawals, physical dependence, risks, etc. I read reports from people saying they used it for one week, then had to go to the hospital. I read some horror stories from people who quit cold turkey. From what I was reading... the withdrawals sounded *far worse* than kratom. The thought of becoming physically dependent on Phenibut *horrified* me. I knew I had addictive tendencies, so I knew trying phenibut could be dangerous.

So I placed an order. Solid decision-making skills, I know. I told myself I’d only use it twice a week, as many redditors suggested. I didn’t want to develop ANOTHER addiction.

First time I used it, was the day it arrived on Monday, April 23. I was pretty damn excited, not gonna lie. So excited, that despite the package not being in my hands until 9pm, I still opened it up and tried 1.3 grams. I knew it takes hours to kick in, I knew I should have waited til the next morning, but I couldn’t. Of course, I went to bed before I felt anything.

But the next morning, I woke up feeling more refreshed than I ever remembered. I had very vivid, memorable dreams. And for the rest of that day, I felt a subtle increase in confidence. But I couldn’t quite *pinpoint* what the effects were. So, in my eagerness to try it again, I took a dose on Wednesday morning - just 36 hours after my first dose. I was already breaking my own rules on usage frequency.

Wednesday, it felt amazing. So I tried it again Thursday. Now I was really breaking my rules. But my logic was “Monday doesn’t count, because I took it late in the day. Wednesday was too low of a dose. Today I’ll try a larger dose”. 

I took around 2 grams on Thursday, and honestly, I could write an entire post on that day alone. But for times’ sake, I’ll just say... I felt amazing. Social anxiety totally gone, but without that feeling of being on a “drug”, like when taking benzos. The anxiety relief did not feel chemical in nature - it didn’t feel like it was enabled as a result of slowed brain activity, an overwhelming sense of calm, or feeling “high”. No... the anxiety relief felt *genuine*. And THAT’S what I loved about phenibut - it all felt so genuine. I was conducting myself maturely, confidently, and precisely, as if it was really me. I was thinking of the right words to say, I was *moving* more confidently - literally just the process of turning around to lock my car door on the way into the store was smooth and confident. People seemed more pleased to engage in small talk with me. It was incredible. Like a lifetime of struggle, cured in an instant. The real me - the me that’s been locked behind a wall made of self doubt, second guessing, and insecurity - has finally broken free. And oh how glorious he is. More glorious than I ever would have imagined. I had to make up for lost time! Call my grandparents and show them that I *am* capable of conversation, laughing, discussing politics. Show my neighbor that I *can* engage in small talk when I see them outside, without it being rushed, uncomfortable, and awkward.

So, I took Friday off - no phenibut. I felt some mild anxiety, but nothing too bad. Then I took pheninut on Saturday, none on Sunday, then I took some Monday. And from Monday onward, until today, I haven’t missed a day.

So, the doses increased quickly. *Too* quickly, in fact. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was actually increasing my dose faster than my tolerance could keep up. I *thought* the phenibut magic was going away because my tolerance was increasing, when in reality, it went away because my dose got too high. This led to a very unfortunate, frankly wasted period of my life, where I spent around 4 months in a nearly persistent state of anhedonia. I would get glimmers of music euphoria and phenibut magic here and there, but it was fleeting. I would take more phenibut - some days as much as 9.2 grams - to try and reclaim that magic, but it just seemed to be farther from my reach the more I took. I also started experiencing some worrisome digestive issues as well.

So, after around 4-5 months of that, I randomly cut around 2.5 grams off my dose. This was about 5 months ago. I was taking around 8.5g/day, but I just randomly decided to take 6.2 grams. And would you believe it? All the phenibut magic had returned. I felt like I had just started taking phenibut again. I was so overjoyed to finally be out of the anhedonia-ridden haze I was living in - frankly a life not even worth living - but I was also overcome with frustration. “Was it really that simple? I was just overdosing on phenibut everyday?”. Either way, I was happy to feel normal again.

I didn’t taper right away, although I should have. I’d be clean now. Unfortunately, I think that reclaiming the “phenibut magic” sort of drove a wedge in any plans to taper off. Why taper off if it feels amazing to take? I stayed around 6.5 grams for a couple months, before again finding myself in a sort of persistent state of anhedonia. Entire days would be void of emotion, even generating facial expressions required a conscientious effort. I was exuding horribly negative vibes to anyone I interacted with. It sucked. 

So again, I made a major dosage cut - cut off a whole gram from my daily dose. Went from 6.5 to 5.5. Any would you believe it... yet again, the phenibut magic came back. To this day, I don’t really understand why this is happening. Why would losing the phenibut magic at a particular dose be alleviated by dropping the dose? Isn’t phenibut known to cause a rapid increase in tolerance? It’s truly a mystery to me, but frankly, it’s a blessing if I’m being honest. How can I complain about finding renewed magic by *DECREASING* my dosage?

So this was around 3 months ago, that I was finding the phenibut magic again, this time at 5.5g. This “phenibut magic” - you know, the increased sociability, music euphoria, all the stuff you want out of phenibut - seemed to steadily increase for me as I dropped my dosage over the course of several weeks. That’s right - as I tapered, the effects got better. This laster until I got down to around 4.8, two months ago. 

Tapering below 4.8 grams would bring some odd feelings of fear. These feelings felt genuine - it didn’t even *feel* like a panic attack or withdrawals, because everything else (heart rate, mood) felt fine. It just felt like there was a genuine reason to be terrified about something. I’ve since learned that this is a classic phenibut withdrawal symptom. You see, just as the *EFFECTS* of phenibut feel genuine - so do the *WITHDRAWALS* feel genuine.

I stagnated around 4.8-5.2 grams for around a month, feeling sort of proud of myself that my dose was so low, but not really making a concerted effort to get it lower. Starting around 5 weeks ago, I finally decided to set myself to a strict, regemented, unwavering taper. I would taper 80mg daily, period.  

It failed after 2 weeks. I got to around 4.4, then it would get weird. I’d reset at 4.8, get to 4.3, then it would get weird. Rinse and repeat. Never got below 4.3.

So starting 4 weeks ago, I decided to try tapering by 25mg/day. No rush, right? And that did the trick. I have been consistently cutting 25mg/day, everyday, for 4 weeks, without any withdrawals. And believe it or not, I actually still get phenibut magic. I still feel all the positive effects one looks for in phenibut. In fact, they seem to increase in potency each day that I taper. Weird, right? But I’m not complaining.

Today I am set to take 3.275 grams. Already taken around 2 grams. And I’m feeling great. 

So, anyways, just wanted to share my story, and encourage anyone who wants to get off phenibut to just do it. Set up a taper plan, don’t rush if you don’t have to, and stick with it. If you’re dealing with anhedonia, emotional numbness, or any other issues associated with higher phenibut doses, you may find that a cut in dosage actually fixes the issue entirely.

I think im at about 4-5 grams taken.

I wanted to know if the best solution was to stop totally today and for the whole week, or if tapering was possible and a good idea

It will be hard but i think i can support the anxiety if it doesnt last more than two-three days

Thanks a lot

As of right now, I have a pretty bad headache/my vision is weird/I dont want to deal with shit/minor anxiety. I took 750mg agmatine and I think it just gave me a headache. I mainly feel bad for what I put my gf through, going through all of this so it gives me more reason to just stop. Ive reacted differently than some other people so I keep thinking what if I dont heal like you guys. I had to quit taking even small amounts of gabapentin because it was giving me this stimulation type anxiety. The last 4-5 days ive only hadid about 750mg gabapentin and 150mg phenibut TOTAL. I hope this passes soon, im alot better then I was before but Im just so sick of it already.

Hi everyone! I've been taking Phenibut for about 9 months now. It was great in the beginning at lower does, but they were still the highest dose recommended (2G). After I got bored of being at just that feeling of euphoria, I increased by a gram, then two grams, and before I knew it, I was at about 15 grams a day SMH. But then about 2 weeks ago I came down with a really nasty flu, and I'm pretty sure it's the coronavirus, but I still haven't gotten my test results back. It's about that time that I started to lose the effects of the supplement, and instead of it having me coming up, running around feeling good, and getting all sorts of great things done throughout the day, it ended up just putting me on my butt, and knocking me out for a couple of hours. So since then, I've been cutting my doses down to about 10 grams a day, but that's with 6 grams first thing in the morning, and then about 4 grams in the afternoon. But by the second dose, it just knocks me back out again. Not only all that, but I started having discomfort where my liver is located, and on the two sides of my lower back, so I went to the hospital for blood work to be done. They came back with the results and said my liver enzymes were elevated to 65, and that the cut off is 55, so not to bad they said. Then they mentioned that the protein was elevated slightly as well, and that's the kidney discomfort on my lower back. So today, I've taken **Adrafinil** so I can keep my energy up to complete my work here at my home office, and took 2 grams Phenibut, as well as 6 grams of Kratom to help with anxiety / any pain or discomfort. I figure I’ll take another 2 grams later in the afternoon, and hope it doesn’t knock me out. Then another 2 grams before bed. Really hoping that if I cut this stuff down below 7 grams, I can prevent further liver degeneration, and then slowly back out little by little from the does from there, maybe once a week.

I’ve never posted any comments on any sites or pages or anything like this before. I think I’m just looking for some pointers, and maybe some support as I go thru the withdrawal symptoms. 

I know what I’ve done to myself is unbelievably stupid, and now I’m going to pay for it to get off of this what once was amazing substance.

Tomorrow I also get to start my new medicament called ""moclobemide"" for depression and social anxiety (it's an MAO-Inhibitor). July is the month of my university where I have to do 3 exams and 2 scientific papers. I already have a lot written for the papers but I didn't start learning.

What can I do to get through this even if I'm withdrawing from phenibut? I even gave up smoking cigarettes 5 days ago and this is also some nasty withdrawal. Maybe I should continue smoking at least? Today I feel that my head doesn't function well without phenibut. Cigarette withdrawal gives me very strange feelings of stomach and hunger but not being able to eat and drink much. I can't read or study well and I can feel the anxiety, stress, negative thoughts and unpleasant feeling coming.

Any ideas, suggestions? Help please, I know it was dumb af but I felt good for 2 months in my life. That was something I never had.

PS: Tomorrow is saturday, so if benzos would help, I would have to get them from the hospital, right? Can I still learn for exams on benzos? The scientific writing part is no problem like learning for exams. I still could rewrite the exams so that's okay.

Just a little insomnia and maybe slightly elevated anxiety here and there, but I wasn't struggling with it in the slightest.

And then I got down to 3g. Literally the day I hit the 3g mark, I had a seizure and some memory loss (as some of you may have seen in my post the other day). Upped my dose to 3.4g to be safe and started dropping from there. Went to 3.2, no problems. Then 3.1. 

Then I dropped to 2.9mg, and like clockwork, had brutal anxiety the next day. It's like the last 3 grams are the final boss of a phenibut taper.

I gotta get completely cleaned up by August (or really, late July, because I need to be off *and* out of acute w/d by early August) or I miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime.

Day 7 seemed to be a turning point:after the baclofen I was actually in a pretty good mood. Didn't expect it this early. However I did get a nasty case of pink eye. I was unable to play video games to keep my mind off anything. And anytime I was between baclofen and/or lorazepam doses I was pretty sour. But otherwise I did have some happy throughout the day. 

Also wanted to note, last couple nights seemed like I sweat and felt unusually hot. Even now when I lay down near the air conditioner I'm sweating. Yeck.
