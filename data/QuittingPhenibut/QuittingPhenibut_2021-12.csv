- Started taking phenibut 2g 2x per week, for a bout 5 weeks.

- ​My last full dose was on the 24th of December, by the 28th I believe withdrawals kicked in as my sleep was very disturbed that night.

- the next night, 29th, I had full blown insomnia, I hadn't fully realised the position I was in at this point, so I took 1g of phenibut, thinking it would salvage the night for me. It didn't do anything, I didn't sleep at all.The next two days have been just as bad, no sleep whatsoever.

- I don't really have any other withdrawals, outside some mild anxiety. 

Do I continue, push through, or do I redose and commit to tapering down sensibly in the new year?

I have never done drugs, have no past addiction issues nor compulsion to take phenibut. These sleep issues feel serious though, so pushing through feels like a bad idea now. Especially as I guess technicaly it's only been 2 days as I had phenibut on the 29th.

Any guidance would be much appreciated, it's surreal that I'm finishing the year with addiction issues after the worst year of my life dealing with anxiety and depression for the first time.",1

So I recently detoxed off of long time prescribed gabapentin. Ive also used phenibut off and on over the years without any addiction issues, until now. I found that during my gabapentin taper an occasional phenibut dose really took the edge off. I really believed I wasn't overdoing it but I was definitely wrong. At this moment I am experiencing tinnitus, tachycardia, sweating, tremors, and a very strange internal feeling. I'm not sure how to describe it but I will try. There's a kind of internal vibration along with a strange feeling of emptiness in my chest and stomach. It feels strange to breathe and I'm very sensitive to sound. I've never experienced anything like this. I would suck it up and just lay down for a few days, but the timing couldn't be worse. My grandfather passed away on Christmas day and my grandmother will flying his body into town today to begin making funeral arrangements.  I don't know how to be there for her and help as I should while I'm in this state. Does anyone know of anything I can do to get some relief from this? Do any stores in the Cincinnati area sell phenibut or anything that may help? And I have to at least throw this out there... If anyone is in the area that can offer some much needed assistance Please PM me. I feel so hopeless and helpless right now.",7

I still have the symptoms I had but they are a lot less intense. My main issue now going forward is the RLS but last night I found that sleeping with a pillow between my legs and pulling the bed sheets really tight to pin my legs down helped a lot. They still tingle but it wasn't unbearable and I managed to actually get about 6 or 7 hours of sleep. 

I wouldn't say I am happy or out of the woods yet but I'm no longer worrying about withdrawal 24/7 now. Mindset really is key to getting through this I think. Worrying makes all the symptoms so much worse.",6

First and foremost, I am so glad this community exists. Your stories and experiences have been giving me strength when I feel like redosing or giving up on my taper, so thank you for being you.

What had been a fun thing to have a couple times a week turned into a 9 month 3-5gpd habit; it became a way to deal with a newly stressful life, an escape from my problems. All seemed to be going well until it didn't. One day after continuous supplementing, I reached a level of depersonalization that lasted 2 days and scared me straight. Needless to say this was my wakeup call currently to taper and get say goodbye to this stuff for good.

Currently in my taper and here is my general protocol

1. Using Agmatine (1g) 30-60  minutes before my reduced phenibut dose
2. Reducing by 100-150mg per day (I will likely stay in a reduction zone of 10-100 mg per day, just started bigger cuts with the added motivation and help from agmatine)
3. Using agmatine a second time in the day either A). 10 hours after my phenibut dose or B). Before bedtime
4. Exercising daily 
5. Incorporating NAC before bedtime (1.2-1.8g)
6. Reducing screen time/ social media time
7. Reading more
8. Going on an evening walk
9. Finding reasons to be thankful when negative thoughts start to creep in
10. REMEMBERING WHY I STARTED AND NOT GIVING IN TO THE CRAVINGS

Today's dose was 1.6g and I'm looking forward to tomorrow and seeing myself continue what I started.

Let me be clear: THIS IS NOT EASY

After riding high so long  where I am now is not a fun place to be, but I accept that there will be lows as a result of my actions and I know that THE PROCESS WILL BE WORTH IT!

Knowing that there are others fighting alongside me gives me strength, so keep fighting! I will do an update in a couple weeks, but until then I'm here for you all.

Good luck",12

I'm at 7.2g (3.6g/2 times a day). I had my husband help me and it was working...until we all got Covid and he stopped helping even after we got well again. I understand he doesn't want to babysit the situation with me, it's pretty pathetic. He takes 300mg a day, and I'm out of control. My withdrawals are nothing like his apparently, I panic and have insomnia. The usual. He sleeps like a baby and only acts a little distant. 

Months ago my shipment got delayed and I was out, so the withdrawals had me driving to the ER praying they could calm my anxiety. They did while in the hospital, but they had no clue what phenibut was. No doctor does in this town probably. I've learned that not any old anti-anxiety medication will help, and gabapentin helps somewhat...but unless you have a nerve pain situation, there's no way to get that to help here. My question is, how can I approach an ""all knowing"" doctor about this struggle and convince him that Baclofen is what would help taper and quit the most? 

They want to prescribe what they've seen works for anxiety, telling them I've done research online and through reddit will end in eye rolls, plus a mark on my medical record as an addict. Honestly it's probably already there with the ER visit. Having anxiety issues already with no medical insurance at the time, it started with me trying the ""Sleep Walker"" pills sold at convenient stores that my coworker recommended...I was just plain dumb thinking it was too good to be true. 

Yes I am obviously addicted to this, but I didn't know I would be. From there I ended up ordering phenibut online and increased over time in three years I believe. I can't keep doing this, and I despise myself for not being able to taper myself. I will have to somehow, because me with these withdrawals with three kids is not possible. 


Side note: I bet a lot of people sued that company for not understanding what was in it, after the FDA made them take phenibut out of their product. Thank you in advance, no bashing please, I am already aware of how gullible I was.",6

I remember being in the hospital lobby having serious panic attacks, pacing my neighborhood for hours in the middle of the night… driving down the freeway mid panic attack bc I couldn’t sit still. It sounds so sad and desperate looking back. I feel for my girlfriend (of 13 years, just turned 30) having to deal with me.


Couldn’t tell you how man serious panic attacks I had, the whole experience actually left me with anxiety afterwards which led to more bad decisions… as I’ve never dealt with anxiety till then (29.) I do remember starting to feel better, and realistically how much better life is now though. 

I was redosing phenibut and kratom trying to catch unchasable highs, thinking I could just taper off. Just had to get that off my chest. I feel for everyone going through that, it was 100% one of the hardest things i’ve done in my life… and i’ve been through addiction.

It was the final nail in the coffin that really showed me that i’m done with using drugs like that though… and how nice it is to be able to just relax and watch TV, smoke a little CBD.

I took Phenibut 2 - 3 times per week for 6 weeks and have successdully tapered down and have been totally clean for 4 days now. Good news is I have only 1 withdrawal symptom that I never had before I started taking Phenibut. Bad news is this 1 symptom is driving me nuts. I've developed quite bad RLS that prevents me from sleeping. I've only had 1 night of sleep in 4 days because my calf muscles can't stop twitching and ""buzzing"". It's annoying as hell and prevents me from being able to relax no matter how tired I am. I've got a bottle of L-DOPA from a trusted supplier and am debating taking some tonight to see if there is any improvements.

Have any of you experienced this after stopping Phenibut? I was also getting it but to a milder extent on the days I didn't take Phenibut. I'd say it started about 2 weeks after starting Phenibut and only happened on my 2 - 3 day breaks.

I've posted here over the last 2 weeks documenting my journey through a cold turkey Phenibut Withdrawal. I am VERY happy to say this will more than likely be my final update.

**To quickly recap:** Young healthy male. I have been dosing 2-3g of Phenibut HCL each morning for the last 2 years. I ran out of supply unexpectedly and was forced into withdrawals.  Luckily, on day1, My doctor prescribed me Diazepam and issued me a taper plan.

***Week 1:*** *2mg in the morning / 2mg at night*

***Week 2:*** *1mg morning / 2mg night*

***Week 3:*** *1mg / 1mg*

you get the idea.

&#x200B;

**The first week** was absolutely brutal. I had no energy, my muscles were very weak. I felt like an old man. Life seemed black & white, dissociation was common.  Although 4mg of Valium wouldn't help much in general (such a low dose), I found it very reassuring that I'd ""calm down"" and make it through as long as I followed the taper plan.  The worst part was the irritability. Because everything is lack luster, I found myself getting overly emotional and hyper reactive to things that normally wouldn't bother me.  Day 3-6 were the worst for me, peak symptoms.

I found that my leg and arm muscles would spasm occasionally, nothing I could do except let it spas. My resting heart rate was jacked. I would have internal panic attacks because I'd become aware of my heart rate, and it would spiral & spiral. Racing thoughts, etc. I elaborate in my other posts about symptoms as well so I will move on.

*\*\*\*I feel it is also important to note that at the very end of the night, I use THC to fall asleep. I have a high tolerance to THC and use each night in large amounts (Dabs). I found THC exasperated these negative symptoms significantly. Heart rate, anxiety, dissociation, etc. Although it did help me fall asleep. Subjective Anecdote\*\*\**

As of yesterday, **Day 11**, things started to normalize again. I did not feel the need to dose the Valium...so I didn't. I no longer thought so much about the ""withdrawals"" and just went about my day. The anxiety and ""black & white"" feeling of life started to brighten. I was myself for the first time in a while. Well, close. Maybe.

Today I did not supplement with my Valium either.

**ALL** negative symptoms have resided except my heart rate. Tachycardia. Resting? It's high. Exercising? It's jacked. After I smoke Weed? feels like I'm exercising.

Other than that...I feel confident saying I have beaten Phenibut for **GOOD.**

**Not bragging at all,** I just thought it would be worse than it actually was given the literature. *(It was pretty dang bad)*

Phenibut is no joke. I deserved to be put through the withdrawals as I did not respect the substance. It's amazing & I sure will miss it but no substance is worth being physically & cognitively dependent on.

Endless Thank you's to this group for the the advice & input. Most of all, making me feel like I'm not alone in this.

***Much love.***",11

Hearing the success stories and how supportive everyone is of one another gives me hope that I can finally kick this too.

Had been taking phenibut on and off for a couple years, but due to some stressful life events I began a roughly 2-3.5gpd habit over the past 8 months.

I feel stable enough at 2gpd and am going to begin my taper and am planning on doing the following:

-30-45 minutes before my phenibut dose 1-1.5 grams agmatine sulfate

-Measuring out Phenibut F.A.A reducing every day by .05g

-Performing higher intensity exercise daily (already train every day as is, but going to put more emphasis on the cardiovascular aspect)

-Improving my diet and staying away from junk foods

-Staying away from social media and easy dopamine traps.

-Taking NAC 2x per day at 1.2-1.8g each dose to combat glutamate surges.

I am fully prepared that if my taper is feeling too fast that I maintain whatever dose I find myself at until I'm comfortable to continue tapering. 

I hope that I will be able to report back with positive news and give continued updates. I am fully prepared for it not to be a cakewalk, but I put myself in this hole and I am committed to climbing out of it. Thankful for this community",5

At the peak i was using around 10-15 grams daily. The method I used to quit was a very long slow taper. This was nearly a year long process, however sobriety is a marathon not a race.

The first thing I did was taper down from 10+ grams to a reasonable 2 grams daily. This took about 6 months of tapering. Once, I was only taking 2 grams per day I sustained that dosage for a couple months. Then dropped down to 1 gram per day.  From 1 gram per day, to 1/2 gram per day. 

At this point I was using capsules instead of powder and one capsule equated to about half a gram (0.667 g). So instead of dropping my daily dose, I took one capsule every other day. I sustained that protocol for about a month. Then, began taking one capsule every three days. Then once every 7 days. I continued this until I noticed it had been a couple week and I had completely forgotten to even take the weekly doses. 

During the whole tapering process I experienced minimal withdrawal symptoms if any at all. The only advice I can give is to think long term and not rush the process.",19

I've tried tapering a couple times with varying degrees of success but never actually jumped off and always ended up bringing my dosage back up. This time I managed to comfortably get down to 250mg once a day and I got nervous and stayed on that dose very comfortably for about 2 weeks.

Here's my current issue. One day, out of the blue, I started having really bad anxiety and panic attacks even with my 250mg dose. Maybe my brain was tricking me but I thought about it and it definitely felt like phenibut withdrawal to me. So I took more, didn't get better, took a little more, didn't get better, and finally took a hail marry dose (I think 750mg?) And felt a little better but it ultimately made me feel really sick too. It's been a week now and I'm trying really hard to not take a bunch but no matter what I do I've been having these relentless waves of anxiety and panic attacks along with little to no sleep. The 250-500mg doses I've taken are making absolutely no difference, I even took a gram yesterday and still nothing. I think today's day 6 or 7 of this and I was really close to calling an ambulance yesterday because I absolutely couldn't stop shaking and gagging. Luckily my friend called and I told them what was going on and they convinced me to try and stick with it a bit longer.

I have a 180 count of ND 250mg Phenibut capsules and I've had this same bottle for probably a couple months now. I noticed this all started when I was half way through the bottle. Do you think it's possible that my phenibut either went bad, got halfway filled with a bad batch, or something else and I've inadvertently went CT? Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I'm worried I've been prolonging my suffering by taking a couple caps everyday even though they do absolutely nothing... I don't have access to a doctor rn but I do have NAC and Agmatine sulphate which I have been taking but I can't really tell if it's helping. Any advice or kind words is greatly appreciated.",2

I made a post in here a week or so ago saying I was forced to stop using Phenibut due to not being able to order it online. I dosed every morning for about 2 years with 2-3g of Phenibut HCL. 

my doctor prescribed me 2mg Valium to take twice a day during the first week of withdrawals. Then I will lower the Valium dose as the weeks go on, with the intent of being off of all substances within a month. 

The first three days were brutal. Even with the low dose Benzodiazepine, I was struggling with cognitive dissociation, racing thoughts, irritability, heart palpitations, minor muscle twitches, and severe fatigue. I felt like an old man. 

I cannot imagine cold turkey quitting and NOT having a treatment plan in place to taper off…congrats to those who have survived that. Legit. 

On day 3, sparing you the details, I had a very stressful and awful day. This was the peak of withdrawals. Even with the Valium, I felt like I “lost my mind.” I threw my mug of water across the room and started sobbing due to just feeling “overwhelmed.” I never do things like this. It was the heightened sensitivity to EVERYTHING that over stimulated me cognitively. I think the combination of High Stress & the withdrawals threw me into a minor state of psychosis. It took about an hour or so for me to calm down and go to sleep. 

As of day 5, I stopped thinking “omg I’m off the phenibut and it’s going to be awful!!” 

I just felt…better. Less anxiety, the tense muscles/heart feeling started going away more and more each day. I stopped thinking about it as much. 

As of today (day 8): I am feeling relatively normal. I am not downplaying the severity of cold turkey quitting, It’s not a joke at all. I am thankful that I never increased my dosage over 3g a day or else I believe this would’ve been worse. 
I know I have a wayssssss to go before I’m “reset” but the confidence in being “myself” without relying on it makes it all worth it. 

I guess what I’m trying to say, and the whole point of this group, is that YOU CAN DO IT. I am beyond thankful for the advice, support, and guidance this group has given me. You aren’t alone!

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask  and I’ll try to elaborate. 

Much love, Happy Holidays.",20

The following scenario is going on with me right now. I have been consuming Phenibut daily for about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks recently, initially in dosages of 1.5 g, but pretty soon in the 2.0 g range. On a few, few days I have also reached dosages of up to 3.5 g, but never on several days in a row. Unfortunately, my order is currently delayed, which means that I took my last dose (1.5 g) last Tuesday, about 48h ago. So now there is nothing left, which is why I unintentionally went into cold turkey withdrawal. 

Already after 12-24 hours I felt increased inner restlessness and anxiety, depressed mood and motivation, a little later already myoclonias, sometimes a little aching muscles, light trembling, heavy sweating, loss of appetite, etc. came. These symptoms have remained so far, sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker, in any case still halfway bearable, even if not nice - only sleeping really turns out to be an absolute disaster right now.

At this point I ask myself whether what I feel so far is only a foretaste of stronger withdrawal symptoms that will set in later, i.e. initially only rebound effects, or whether withdrawal has already begun. Furthermore, I would be interested to know at which point in time one would have to expect the highest intensity of withdrawal, based on my (careless and not exemplary) consumption behavior?

If my delivery still arrives today or tomorrow, I would take a small dose (e.g. 500 mg) for stabilization and then carefully taper off from there (Cold Turkey should never be an option anyway, at least if you do it alone without medical supervision).

Many thanks to you in advance!",5

Eventually by last Monday night I was so out of it I couldn’t sleep and I felt so foggy and confused I went to the er.

I've not been using extremely high doses, normally just 1 gram several hours before bedtime, with occasional spikes to up to 2 g for particularly anxious times but generally staying at 1 g/day.

My anxiety levels have crept up for no apparent reason over the past several months, even without reducing my dose, and now I'm having panic attacks roughly every day or two. Things got worse when I tried to cut down to 750 mg/day about a week ago, which would have been the start of a taper, and I caved and reinstated the 1000 mg after two nights at 750. The panic attacks won't let up, though. Today I obtained a script for hydroxyzine which does seem to help a bit, although I doubt it will do much once I restart the taper.

I purchased 100g of powder in addition to the 250 mg capsules I had been taking, of which I have most of a 180 ct bottle left. My overall plan is to do a very slow taper, taking my daily dose down by 100 mg each week for 9 weeks and then kick it from there.

Does this seem like a reasonable plan? Is there anyone else out there who has been a very long-term user of fairly moderate doses? If so, what did you try and how did it go?",3

It's been 2 weeks since starting baclofen. Not sure how to continue. I think emotionally It's mostly depression, with some anxiety. I think the anxiety has gotten better recently reading some notes I wrote over the course of this? But I'm not fully certain because of my bad memory recently. Also the past few days I sometimes feel ""ok"" randomly for a bit like now. How should I proceed?

I've been having some anxiety and depression on baclofen since after 3-5 days or so in, and I've been on it for about 2 weeks now. I feel like it's getting better sometimes but the anxiety is still there sometimes and some depression.

Some backstory. I went from 1.2g of phenibut to 20mg of baclofen (10mg twice a day). my phenibut daily intake was up to 2.2grams at about the end of a months use mostly was about 1.5 grams most of the time though. I tried to quickly reduce it and wasn't doing so well so I put it back to about 1.2 and had a bad time too, didn't know there were some bad withdrawals. I was also using kratom when I was at the 1.2 for about 5 days then a few days after after starting baclofen because I felt a bit of depression but I discontinued it to heal my brain. I felt great the first few days of baclofen and my antipsychotic seemed to kick in and was starting to work better suddenly which hadn't been seeming to work too well, I think it was because of serious withdrawals from phenibut and slowly to switching to baclofen leveled me out? But I was switched to another medicine when I was prescribed baclofen so I started taking those and the new medicine doesn't seem to be doing much, slowly seemed to get worse after a few days of switching and got worse over time, I think it's some sort of withdrawals or the new medicine isn't working? I switched back to the other one after about 10 days. and hoping it will start working again soon.

I'm a bit concerned about lowering the baclofen, will my anxiety get worse? I'm also concerned if the depression will too or if that is just from switching to baclofen and it killed the phenibut high. My memory throughout all this phenibut and baclofen seems to have gotten worse and I want to get off if I can. I feel like a bit of a mess, but I feel way better then when I was seriously withdrawaling from phenibut, so that's something. Any insight or advice on all this? Can I take some sort of anti anxiety or other medicine or etc? I also can't sleep since changing my medicine back, which i was having problems with before. I plan to see my doctor again soon.

I’ve been a daily Phenibut user since October 2020. I dose each morning with roughly 2-3g of Phenibut.

I went to order more last week on the most popular nootropics website and was emailed later in the week saying they are out of inventory. 

I went to my doctor and explained the situation and she prescribed me Valium as an alternative to taper off Phenibut. 

Week 1: 2mg Valium in morning/2mg at night
Week 2: 1mg morning: 2mg night
Week 3: 1mg/1mg
Week 4: 1mg
Week 5: off Benzos and Phenibut. 

I’m hoping this goes smoothly. I am only on day 3 and I definitely feel off. The Valium helps take rebound anxiety away. I’m hoping for a smooth taper here.

I had been using about 0.75-1.0mg phenibut everyday for a little over a month then realized it was messing with my mood so I stopped and got back on Wellbutrin (I go off and on of it when I need it and I never have any issues going off/on it) and was just taking a little phen here and there, but then I had a few days where I had some stressful stuff going on so I took 1g in the AM and it felt so nice I took 0.75-1g later at night to keep it going. It felt great so I did that for just TWO more days, then was like ""I dont want to get hooked on this stuff so I'm just gonna take 1 of my 250mg tomorrow"". Little did I know that this short of a use of a higher dose would be enough to send me into physical withdrawals. I am conquering the mental side of it, both with help of Wellbutrin and meditation, but the physical side is still happening, so I took two more 250mg spaced out for 2 days and have been struggling. I have a very strong buzzing feeling in my body and my head gets little dizzy swings and major ear ringing. basically I halved my daily dose suddenly down to 500-750mg but only after 3 god damn days. this shit is unreal, I cannot believe the withdrawal hits so hard so quickly.

anyways, I've been poking around this sub to get helpful info and I've been taking NAC, Magnesium, CBD, and have agmatine arriving today. I understand how to use it but just now I stumbled upon a comment saying agmatine potentiates Wellbutrin 10x? should I not take my Wellbutrin while I taper off phenibut with the help of agmatine? I know my experience is not as high of doses as some on here, but the withdrawals of just 3 days of \~2g per day is nothing to scoff at. I also am a regular user of low doses of kratom (0.7g capsules.. about 3-5 throughout the day, never had an issues suddenly stopping this) and I got freaked out and stopped that suddenly too bc I didnt know what was going on at first, which prob made the withdrawal WORSE. I got back on 1-2 capsules of that once I realized what I was experiencing was phen withdrawal. But just want to make sure I dont inadvertently fuck myself up with the Agmatine interfering with my Wellbutrin.

I quit CT involuntarily because I procrastinated on ordering and then when I only had two doses left found out that ND was OOS. I ordered from Liftmode, which just came this morning.

I binged somewhere around 6-9gpd for the last 2 1/2 months. Started a taper a few days ago and cut down to around 5gpd, kind of fast but that’s what felt doable at the time. 3 doses a day usually. My ex gf came to get some of her stuff from my apartment and swiped my remaining phenibut, whatever was left in my 100g LM container. I freaked out and called my doctor, had an appointment today. He was very sympathetic and said he was comfortable prescribing me Baclofen for a taper. Unfortunately, and he would not be budged and got very stern about it, he prescribed me 26 5mg pills. Reading up on this stuff, how screwed am I? That can’t be enough right? I’m reading that 10mg baclofen=1g phenibut and I’m very recently at 5gpd. I’m fully expecting to eat shit but am scared to death as I had a seizure from alcohol wd a few years ago and a lot of these symptoms sound/feel similar. My friend brought me her leftover gabapentin, but it’s 12 100mg pills, hardly enough to put me at ease. 


I’m thinking of just waiting until wd gets bad enough and going to the e.r but I live in a rural area and it’s a total crapshoot to how they react there, I could get psyche warded or something for Christ’s sake and prob die in there so I’m very nervous. I know I did this to myself but man am I nervous about the upcoming days. I took a 2g dose I had put aside days ago when traveling, that’s the last of it and can’t even order more if I wanted to until pay day on Thursday. 


Any suggestions? I had printed out a few case reports and info for my doctor earlier and he barely glanced at them, I don’t feel super confident the e.r will be better at all. If anyone has any other remedies, I am very open. I am recovering alcoholic and would very much not like to resort to alcohol if at all possible.


Edit: any ideas in the minimum gabapentin and baclofen dosages to get me by without serious risk? Or is dependent on the person and usage?",3

This is my story and how you can do this. Please read if you want help.,"I want to share my experience with all of you struggling and scared. 

I began my Phenibut use when my new doctor told me they were taking me off of my 7 year 30mg a day Valium prescription. It was a clusterfuck and the doc almost sent me into seizures so I redressed the doctor and she sent me to the psych side of the practice where I was painfully bit safely weaned down from 15mgs to 0 gradually. During the time that the first doctor trying to strip my Valium dose down to 0 in a couple weeks, I found Phenibut in desperation and worked myself up to a 17 GRAM PER DAY HABIT which persisted at that amount for about 3 months while I moved to the psych side and got stabilized! I was in so much agony from the benzo withdrawals that I didn't have it in me to even research what Phenibut does. I just took it after a friend mentioned it. This is odd because as a person who is very interested in pharmacology, I read DEEP into every substance I try and I've at least tried about everything. 

Once a bit stable I began to read about Phenibut and I found this particular place on Reddit which many people were supportive and encouraging. I learned how each of us is quite different when it comes to Phenibut withdrawal and how impossible this drugs appears to be for some of us to kick. I seemed to be a hard case since dropping from 17 to 16 grams over a week was difficult for me in particular (this is not the experience most seem to have here). I was told and firmly believe in dropping by percentages over mgs as a detox protocol. So I bought a mg scale and proceeded to drop to 13 grams over a few months or so calculating different percentages to see what was uncomfortably comfortable for me. I SLOWED down or halted the process when I needed to and resumed when I felt ready to do so again. Then...something awful happened around 12-13 grams per day. My scale slowly seemed to be telling me there was more on it everytime I removed a little. I probably wasted a month trying to get back on track. After researching mg scales, I bought a different scale on Amazon that was about $10 more (maybe $34 in total?). I would suggest this scale to ANYONE going through this heinous process. I actually bought 2 in case on failed and both work after 3½ or so years. The scale is a Gemini 20 model American Weigh Scale, for those who are curious and looking for a reliable scale.

Armed with a new reliable scale and all the clinical case studies I could find after pouring through tons of google scholar information and other academic resources, I got my Phenibut usage back under control about a week later and began titrating once more. It is important to note that I went between 7-11 grams per day for about a year before treading into the 6 gram per day territory well over a year after that. I was terrified of the prospect of reducing my dose any more, although a very pertinent thing I noticed is that many many people get stuck around 7grams per day and it was comforting to know that I was not alone. It took me 2½ years to slowly and fairly comfortably (though not always) and inevitably, reach the point I could not progress any further after reaching 5.8 grams per day. It is also important to note that I found that, for me, when I did reach the point of 5.9 grams per day, dropping even 100mgs over 2 weeks was absolute hell and I couldn't progress.

I heard more people than not seemed to have a good deal of success when titrating from 7 grams per day or less if they followed a somewhat rigid titration schedule. There was in fact a case in Canada that was published which displayed the tables for titration from Phenibut to Baclofen and it included everything else including what else he was using as well as he was feeling. I did a lot of research on Baclofen and saw that it had similar properties but could not fathom how it would be easier to titrate off one Gabapentinoid to another that had both VGCC ą2 subunit controller effects as well as effects on Gaba B receptors but I was scared and willing to do anything. When I was on 13-8 grams per day I repeatedly asked my psychiatrist about Baclofen and showed her the case study of a successful detox. She seemed to agree at first but then told me she could not prescribe it offlabel for that purpose due Baclofen falling out of the field of psychiatric medicine. I was destroyed until years later I gave in and bought 2 25 pill blister packs of 25mgs of Baclofen and 2 50 pill blister packs of 10mg Baclofen on an Indian pharmaceutical site that advertised on the clearnet in the US.

I began my titration from Phenibut to Baclofen, splitting my dose into morning/afternoon and night doses spaced  roughly 12 hours apart. My first 3 days I replaced 1 gram of Phenibut with 10mgs of Baclofen and noticed zero withdrawals and very low side effects. In the coming 2 weeks I picked up the pace trading another 10, 12.5, 20, 25, and eventually 40mgs of Baclofen for its equivalent in Phenibut...I went too fast and suffered the consequences of sheer terror during the day and quickly backtracked to less Baclofen and more Phenibut. I was back to 25mgs daily for 2.5grams of Phenibut daily. After 2 days of backing up I felt well again.

I started again and took it slower moving up in increments of 5, 10, and 12.5mgs of Baclofen per week for every 0.5, 1, and 12.5 grams of Phenibut respectively. After about 6 weeks of doing this comfortably I was off Phenibut entirely and on Baclofen only. I was scared to come off 60mgs of Baclofen but did so 5-15mgs a week but took my time, and eventually got off all of it over another 6 weeks or so. I was amazed at how easy it was because I studied how difficult it was to withdrawal from Baclofen after being on it for awhile. Baclofen had some side effects but they were entirely manageable compared to Phenibut withdrawal. 

I FINALLY BEAT THIS SHIT!

Everyone is different but if you are struggling like I was, please know there's hope. Below are some key pointers.

-GET A GOOD SCALE! I don't care what brand it is but my suggestion, which I stand by, is in my story.

-Many people who begin at high doses and stay there for awhile struggle to drop their dose between 6-8 grams per day. This is normal.

-Take it easy titrating. If you are worried about Phenibut being banned, get stocked NOW!

-Try to get Baclofen from a doc, any doc, but you may need an internal medicine doc. All of them may be skeptical do to Phenibut being largely unknown to others than new pharmacists who have to know RC's and supplements. Docs also know little about Baclofen but there are plenty more of case studies of Baclofen causing life threatening withdrawals than its use in treating Phenibut withdrawal. This only occurs if you're on large amounts of Baclofen for several months and don't titrate.

-If you can't get Baclofen from a doc, ask around on here for where to get it without a script. It is not a controlled substance.

-Take your Baclofen taper at a reasonable pace. Follow the case study below. You can also loosen the parameters given your not on Baclofen for 5 months or more as it will get harder to come off.

PLEASE PLEASE, Lemme know if you have any questions!

However, a couple bouts of little self control had me binging and bringing my tolerance back up periodically. I became tired of this and got my hands on prescriptions for pretty hefty doses of baclofen (80mgpd) and gabapentin (2400mgpd) intending that I would have some left over. After a recent binge that almost cost me my girlfriend and place of living,  I decided to start a rapid rapid taper and went from 3gpd to 2.5, 1.8 then 1.5 while taking 60-80mg of baclofen and 1600 gabapentin. Approximately 14 hours after I took the 1.5g, I got home, went to bed, and started experiencing the internal tremors. After doing some research and finding out that these are signs of glutimate storms I promptly guzzled down a good amount of phenibut and have been waiting for it to kick in as I type this

I had read somewhere that the gabapentin would protect against glutamate surges which is why I sought out the prescription in the first place. I am deathly afraid that these storms will lead to permanent brain damage or external tremors that would render my instrument playing bad which would effectively end my life

Then my doctor got me some baclofen, and I was supposed to just stop the phenibut and take the baclofen instead at 10mg twice a day, and then reduce that over a 2 week period. 

Right as I was about to do that, I managed to get a hold of a few 10mg valium, and I just took those for three or four days with no phenibut or baclofen. I must say: I enjoyed them a LOT! They're just so hard to find. Phenibut just can't compare with a good benzo, and to me, diazepam is the gold standard. 

When the valium was gone, I started the baclofen, and over the next couple weeks, I tapered that down to my last one. 

I now have no craving for phenibut at all now. Something about taking that little bit of valium made me feel really unimpressed with phenny, and I even felt a mental nausea when thinking of taking any phenibut at all! I remembered all that horrible ""rebound"" shit, and thought, there's no point in taking a pill against anxiety if that pill will just give it to you in a really elevated way! This memory will be really good for me in the long run!

Yesterday 14:00 was my last dose, I used not more than 450 mg.

However on Tuesday I finally caved in and took some. I was also starting to feel sick from a sinus infection so honestly I just didn’t wanna be in agony the whole time. I only took 0.5 grams that day and honestly didn’t feel much. The next day, Wednesday, I didn’t take any. I don’t think I was experiencing any rebound, especially since my dose was so small, but my cold was definitely making me feel worse. I hardly left my room since my mom works at home, and I didn’t wanna go downstairs and bother her while she’s working. I only went downstairs to get food and that was it. I didn’t even shower and I felt really gross. Then on Thursday, yesterday, I took about a gram at around 9:30am. I was hoping it would give me the push I needed to actually get up and try to take care of myself a little. Luckily it worked and I was able to get myself more food, and even brushed my teeth and showered. My depression and anxiety had evaporated, and my sense of sexual arousal was really high. I actually felt pretty good. The best I’ve probably felt in months. Honestly, I missed it.

Now taking just one gram wouldn’t scare me much since I’m around 180 lbs and 1 gram is considered the maximum therapeutic dose for the weight of an average male, so my rebound probably wouldn’t be that bad. However around 5:30pm I thought “eh, fuck it” and took another gram. After that I noticed some side effects, mostly just drowsiness. My ADHD also became more severe as I couldn’t focus on anything for very long. 

I’m not planning to take any more today, and for at least another week. I might even just quit again, entirely. For now I don’t feel any withdrawals, in fact I’m sure the phenibut is still having an effect on me. Should I expect much rebound when it does stop working? How long would it last. I know I didn’t go over the 3 g weekly limit usually associated with phenibut, but I did take the doses only two days apart, which is why I’m worried. 

TL;DR: I took 2.5 grams of phenibut in the course of 3 days (0.5 g on Tuesday and 2 g on Thursday) and am wondering if I should worry about any withdrawals or rebound depression/anxiety.",1

It's overall a very dynamic substance. Currently the only withdrawal symptoms I'm feeling is one that I've had before, tingling in my face and extremities (some people say this is due to the voltage calcium channels which phenibut blocks). Although I don't have panic attacks or bad insomnia as the last time and so far no crazy rekindling effect. I think I'll just go to my old habit of ""therapeutic"" drinking. Mainly due to the fact that this stupid face tingling is rather annoying and it takes at least a week to disappear, at least for me. Also, being on and off of this substance is tiring and for me it's not really worth it. For some people who abuse it heavily it can really turn your life into a living nightmare. Now, alcohol is pretty bad but at least I know the damn side effects and every doctor knows how alcohol works. But phenibut? If you get into ER because of phenibut they'll just be scratching their heads, there's really no support for phenibut addicts or users who took more then they should have.

This time however, I went to jail and had to go to the quarantine wing for my first 10 days there.  I was on 6 grams per day at this time for at least 8 months, 3 in the morning and 3 at night.  I was exhausted and slept for the first 6 days I was there.  I woke up to shower and call home for the 30 minutes I was allowed out of my cell, and then went back to my cell and slept.  I didn't wake up for food, and since I've been on sublocade for the past year I am constipated a lot and only had to wake up for the bathroom once a day to pee and never for more than 30 seconds a day.

I did lose quite a bit of weight from not waking up for trays, but I had absolutely 0 withdrawal from phenibut.  I kept waiting and waiting for it to hit, and I kept going back to sleep planning to get woken up in withdrawal but it never happened.

I wasn't functioning due to poor mental health and that was the only option at the time. However, I have never exceeded a maximum therapeutic dosage and at my peak I only took 1400mg daily, divided into three doses. I never abused it and never had any desire to get high on it. This, later on, was approved by my shrink. As I got on antidepressants I've started a slow taper, now I am at 600mg per day. No apparent withdrawal symptoms so far. I hope to be clean in a month or so. I have never really abused the substance in the past, only taking it two to four times a month recreationally in the doses of one to two grams.

I've heard about this phenomenon I don't remember the name for when your receptors after prolonged use of gabaergics get so sensitive that you go into a withdrawal if you are off the substance for a long time and take it again. I couldn't find any papers on that, at least none of them are saying how hard you should abuse the substance for it to cause this effect, so I wanted to ask you guys about your personal experience. Did that happen to you? How much did you take and for how long? Did you CT or did you taper? Any information would be very helpful. Thanks in advance for your answers and sorry for the long post.

I then went to a massive decrease to 1350 for 1 day and now 1250 for 2 days on my 3rd day. I'm aware now of how big of jumps these are and my body is probably adjusting but what should I do now? just tired of the nightly panic attacks and no sleep.

Also how do these other meds and things help like baclofen, gabapentin, benzodiazapines when taken separately in conjunction or instead of phenibut? is there a cross tolerance or are these their own things that start from 0 and help significantly and you take them until phenibut is done doing it's thing in the background then you slowly stop taking them. 

Should I see a doctor about trying one of these or something else?",4

https://reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qwmyvm/baclofen_dependence_glutamate_a_neverending_hell/

So I finally bit the bullet; I’ve reduced from 40mg of Baclofen every 2hrs to 32mg. Not instantaneously (1mg intervals every three days), as I’ve been dependant for over a year. 

I’ve also tapered my intake of Diazepam. Previously, 10mg every 4hrs; currently at 14hrs (increased by 2hrs, every three days). 

While tapering, I’ve temporarily discontinued taking my ADHD medication.

However, I’m feeling worse currently:

-	Vision Issues: My vision seems impaired; everything appears slightly blurry / also minor symptoms of HPPD. 
-	Cognitive Issues: Despite reducing my dose, my cognition has undoubtedly taken a significant nosedive. Which I’m incredibly concerned about.
-	Personality: I don’t feel like myself at all. My emotions feel blunted, disassociated.
-	Headaches - it’s more like a constant ringing/buzzing throughout my skull.
-	Glutamate storms, actually appear worse also. Which was my inital reason for lowering my dose, and thought the act of lowering my dose would at least subside some of these effects.

Presently, I feel as if my brain’s fried and that reducing my dosage, which I suspected to help, produces worse effects than I previously discussed.

It’s making me feel extremely depressed and emotional. And I am unsure if I’m making the correct decision.

I feel more impaired by lowering my dose than if I were to continue with my prior dosing schedule.

Apart from feeling a horrid sense of hopelessness and continuing to contemplate ceasing my existence.  I continue to wonder if I’ve made a mistake, that I should return to my previous schedule so that I’m at least functional again.

I’m aware that GABA/Glutamate dysregulation certainly plays a role. And the easiest method for me to fix this is to increase my dose, once more. However, in the long-term, I’m certain this will just be prolonging the inevitable. :/",2

So I jumped from 1gpd of HCL powder down to 750mg of FAA in capsule form.

I read FAA is more pure?  So did I actually make progress going from 1g of HCL to 750mg of FAA? Or did I just start using a stronger more pure Phenibut?",2

So I'm five days in to being full phenibut free. In the end I was on 15g and I just jumped. I am doing it W/D symptom free  with the aid of pregabilin. You may recall me trying this a fortnight ago, but I couldn't buy anymore pregabilin until after the weekend so I had to use phenibut until it attived. I know that's rubbish but I couldn't do it without help.
Agmatine and NAC are now helping me reduce my Preg intake but as I have only taken it for a week, people tell me it won't be so hard to W/D. Any advice on this, and how to combat PAWS. Before any of you want to attack and say what a horror story I have in front of me coming off Preg, please try to phrase it constructively. This addiction has almost killed me and  torn my family apart, so I'm pretty proud to have gotten this far. That said, honesty is what I need. Just not things like "" you have worse  hell in front of you man,"" won't help.

I feel like im weirdly experienced with withdrawing from this awful stuff just bc of my use - I'll use it for 18-24 months, withdraw entirely, stay quit for a year, 18 months, and then end up coming back to it bc i guess I'm just not very careful? Idk.

I was reminded this time about how important expectations management is for Withdrawal because I like many others seem to always focus on the danger area of the first 2½ days, but then each time I've woken up on day 5 with not exactly physical, but certainly, and *profoundly* emotional withdrawal symptoms, I'm caught totally off guard like ""what the hell I made it through the 3 days, didn't I?!""

&nbsp;

And that's why im writing this.

&nbsp;

If you're about to step into anything approaching a steep taper, PLEASE try to remind yourself that you will absolutely stop feeling like you're on the verge of seizing/stroking out/having a heart attack/etc after about 3 days, but you will be in essentially equivalently painful, acute emotional withdrawal for days 4, and most of day 5. 

So don't feel too disappointed or too frustrated if you wake up & find no pink cloud on those days.

Remind yourself that you can now regulate your body temperature.

That you're no longer shaking.

That you beat back a lot of the physical trauma.

And this you can process

&nbsp;

And this is actually an expected PART of the process.

&nbsp;

Feeling certain that you'll feel substantially, unavoidably better before a full, round 7 days is up is overly optimistic, but it gets so much better so much quicker with each day.

&nbsp;

Slog through day 4 & day 5. Take baths; eat until you're constipated. Sleep when you can and expect to feel renewed in mere days.

&nbsp;

Happy quitting, y'all! Past day 6 just a bit ago and hope to never ever be back here again 😭😭",18

Usually i take it everyday for a few months until i force myself to stop for a while, and then begin to take it again. My dosage varies, at the start of my addiction id always start at 1g and work myself gradually in the course of a week to 1.90g which has been the sweet spot for me. And then I stay stable at 1.90g and don't increase dosage for the duration of my addiction. Sometimes and very rarely and this is when i wanna be at my best game when having to do something work related and perform good i will take 2g-2.1g.   


However i didn't really consider my addiction a problem before but now i begin to realise that if i am completely unable to function without this stuff then this is a huge problem. So i am beginning to worry about if i have permanently damaged my brain. Because the brainfog i have without it is terrible. I have recently for a few weeks of my addiction begun taking higher doses 2g-2.1g and have now forced myself to taper off in hope that this will be less severe. I began going down to 1.70g today. But i am unsure how fast i should taper off. My question to you is, do you think i've permanently damaged my brain being such a heavy user for so long? If so do you think there is any chance that it will heal back to its relative normalcy?   


And how likely is it that 2 years of such use will lead to liver disease? I have been having some extreme confusion lately, and i know its a symptom of liver disease. Maybe even a little bit of jaundice.",4
2021-12-03 03:31:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/r7uguw/10_days_after_quitting_i_finally_feel_back_to_my/,10 days after quitting I finally feel back to my old self.,"After not touching phenibut for 2 years due to having had a very hard time quitting it after prolonged use a few years ago, I've allowed myself to buy smaller containers a few times this year as a treat, as I found if I didn't exceed a week, there was little withdrawal. However, I didn't account for the possibility of the regular phenibut from the last source I used  being much higher quality than some others I have used despite their f-phenibut also having been noticeably stronger. 


Long story short, after a week of relatively large doses, but what I had thought were on par or less than the norm for me, I found I was starting to feel much worse than expecting about 2 days after stopping, the anxiety was pretty bad but I think the complete lack of energy and near complete ahedonia arguably were worse to deal with. I figured it'd lift in a day or two but it seemed to continue to peak until day 4-5 and stay there until about day 7-8 where it started to receed. But finally today being around day 10 it feels like a switch has finally flipped and I felt ""normal"" again, I do expect some mood fluctuates for the next couple days because I doubt it changed completely overnight. 

But it's really nice to actually feel like myself again for a while, for a while the fact it was persisting to the degree it was for longer than I'd even taken the phenibut for in the first place was starting to get to me, and a near complete lack of interest and motivation is arguably worse than all but the most extreme of anxiety after a while and it's definitely no fun in combination with it on top of things. 

So I suppose this is just a little warning, though I should've known better, though I've never been someone to get abnormally long symptoms from short use in the past, it can happen, either because I got a much stronger batch than my last one was but dosed the same, or just because I'd taken it a few times this year and the 3rd time taking it several days in a row happened to be one time too many. 

But it's also encouragement, a little bit for myself if I wake up feeling depersonalized or apathetic, a concrete reminder of ""hey you felt completely  back to normal last afternoon and evening, you're almost over it for good"". And to others that are about ready to order more just to feel normal again, to see if you even can feel normal again. It'll pass, maybe it'll be the magic day 5 it is for a lot of people, maybe it took 3 days the last time and at least 10 the next time like for me, but just because it stayed at its peak for days or even a week or more, it doesn't mean it'll take weeks more for it to slowly start to improve enough to begin to feel more like your old self. I knew my mind would play tricks on me and even so I still started to think against all logic that a week of moderately high doses was the one thing to suddenly permanently break my brain and I'd have to start taking it again if I ever wanted to feel normal. 

Phenibut can feel like the absolute best stimulant, yet most perfect anxiolytic you've ever felt when you manage to take just the right dose and everything else lines up right, and then it can feel like you're going through withdrawal for both at the same time right after and I feel like that's part of what makes it so hard to quit, I probably won't ever use it again given that it's been a problem before and this time the withdrawals went far beyond expectations set by previous experience.",9

So, I just quit phenibut *again* (3rd times the charm, right?), and surely little ole me won't completely forget the lessons of the past 18 months from now and be right back where I am. Again 🥲

My WD was very close to a CT, here's what I did, starting from my comfortable average of 4.5gpd:

+ Immediately CT cut to 1.5 gpd (0.5g every 8 hours) on Thursday; withdrew like no one's business for 2½ days.

+ After those 2½ days, I felt stable enough to skip the next 8 hour dose, so I did

+ Then I pushed through and skipped the next 8 hour dose too, which at that point meant I had been basically CT jumped off for 24 hours and decided to just grin & bear it.

+ That was on Saturday, so I'm 7 hours away from 4 full days (84 hrs) clean off

My question now is — will CBD help with these tail-end withdrawal symptoms? My body temperature is still having trouble completely keeping itself in check, hot/cold flashes are still happening, I still feel kind of tight all over, and while I'm no longer getting the very concerning, transient limb numbnesses and extreme pins & needles, my nerves & skin feel very scratchy still. Idk if that makes sense but it just feels like a different, less strong, but almost more irritating genre of pins and needles.

Does anyone have any experience trying to combat these later stage WD symptoms with CBD? Thoughts?",1
