So long story short I went on 1.5 month long bender of about 200 grams. At the point that it started to turn on me l, I knew I was fucked.

Through some research on this sub I was able to come up with my own formula on how I was going to tackle this. I bought NAC agmatine ashwaganda l theanine magnesium and Gaba pills. Since then I‚Äôve been able taper down from like 12gpd to now not even one with almost no issues in like less than 2 weeks.

Now I get a shitty rebound depression/anxiety after taking as little as 500-750mg, even once per week. I find it magnifies the shit out of hang over anxiety or if you take any other drug with it. 

It‚Äôs very odd, because aside from some verbal fluidity I don‚Äôt really get much out of it, and then have a solid day and a half of feeling depressed and anxious.

It's been about 5 months.

I can say that the magic is almost gone and now it just makes me feel anxious and manic.

So, I'm gonna begin my taper. When I decided it was the best thing ever, I stocked up and have a few kilos now.

So, the thing that is really freaking me out is an ear issue. It's feels like a vibrating or shuddering. It's like when you listen to loud music in headphones and you turn it off suddenly and your ears do a like a decibel readjustment thing. I get that sensation all the time and I've noticed that when I listen to music and sing along, I hear my own voice in the forefront.. Something has changed.

2021-11-28 00:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/r3wfvk/tapering_success_from_15gd/,Tapering success from 1.5g/d,"I took Phenibut daily for nearly 10 months, and today I am officially done with it, after a two month taper. 

Was kind of nervous about this going into it, but I‚Äôm glad I took everyone‚Äôs advice and tapered. Beginning in February, I started at ~1gpd, and by May I worked my way up to 1.5 per day. 

Phenibut became a habit to help me sleep as I was working some weird shifts at the time. Like most people I‚Äôve had anxiety here and there, but thankfully nothing I would legitimately need medication for on a daily basis. 

Effects were always mild for me even at 1.5g, but after a few months of taking it, I would definitely feel withdrawal kick in after two days without. 

Anyway, I began my taper during the first week of October, and today (November 27th) I have been 72 hours clean, with zero or minimal withdrawal effects now. 

Here‚Äôs my timeline of my 8-week taper:

Week 1: 1.25g/d

Week 2: 1g/d

Week 3: 0.75g/d

(I started noticing some moderate adjustment effects (maybe mini withdrawal) after reducing to 0.75g. As a result of this, I continued at this dosage for another week to let my body get used to it. )

Week 4: 0.75g/d

Week 5: 0.5g/d

(After week 5, I began tapering more closely, since I figured the percentage change of my dose adjustments were getting bigger. Thankfully, that mini withdrawal I mentioned earlier had subsided. )

Week 6: 0.375g/d

Week 7: 0.25g/d

(After week 7, I definitely noticed another mini-withdrawal. However, being so close to the end, I decided to rough it out. After 4 or 5 days of 250mg/d, I was back to normal). 

For the last week, I continued on 0.25g/day for another week. The following week, I stopped taking it altogether. 

Feel free to ask me anything in the comments!

Edit: as far as supplements go, nothing notable was used. Took my usual magnesium and multivitamin as usual.",14

even dosing another 4g doesn't help 

If I don't dose in the morning, of a dose typically 4gr, i start to have full blown shakes. so now I guess my dose is 4grpd with a constant state of anxiety.

so, for how long will this last ?

I have weed, sleep aids , and I can talk to the doctor about baclofen. should I do that ? should I ask for benzos to relief the anxiety?

I really just want to know, since I've been in this shit for yeeears, for how long will I be feeling shit for - until I reach 0mg or until 2 weeks have passed ?

2021-11-26 17:54:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/r2yyi4/guide_to_quitting_phenibut/,Guide to Quitting Phenibut,"Hey guys, 

This summer I had an absolutely horrible time with getting addicted to phenibut, and I wanted to come on here and share what worked for me. 

To start, DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THIS DRUG. It is absolutely nothing to be fucked with. 

DO NOT START TAKING IT EVERYDAY. 1-2 a week at the absolute most. I thought everyone was just being pussies when they complained about the withdrawal from Phenibut. If you‚Äôve been addicted to kratom, it is absolutely nothing like kratom withdrawal. It does some absolutely horrible things to your mind and body. I wouldn‚Äôt wish my experience on anyone. It put me in the ER TWICE, made me drive to a bridge to commit suicide TWICE, made me alienate everyone in my life, almost caused me to lose my job, gave me terrible memory problems to the point where I couldn‚Äôt remember my own mothers name, or if I had even taken my dose that day. And this was all whilst tapering. 

Rule 1: if you find yourself getting addicted, or think you have the potential to be, ORDER BACLOFEN AS SOON AS YOU CAN. I still have some, and I‚Äôm willing to send it to anyone that asks me, free of charge. I ordered it from alldaychemist but it takes like a MONTH to get to you. So order it as soon as you possibly can.

Baclofen took away all of my weird side effects, especially the suicidal ideation which was the worst symptom for me. 

Rule 2: Ensure you have enough Phenibut to last till your Baclofen comes in. This is a no brainer, obviously. 

Rule 3: Find the lowest possible dose you are comfortable at, and split it into two doses, one in the morning and one at night. This will help you sleep. Ensure you are taking it ON AN EMPTY STOMACH. If you can afford it, purchase the capsule so you aren‚Äôt fucking your teeth up. If you are using powder, WEIGHT IT ON AN ACCURATE SCALE. 

Rule 4: Write down your doses because chances are you will forget how much you are taking like I did.  There‚Äôs plenty of info on the taper schedule so I won‚Äôt get into that. 

Rule 5: EXERCISE. I can‚Äôt stress how important this is.  I stopped exercising because I was so depressed. You don‚Äôt have to leave the house. Do jumping jacks, push-ups, get your body moving. The best thing for me was to run. I felt so much better afterward. Exercise helps your brain chemistry which is all fucked up from Phenibut. 

Rule 6: SUPPLEMENTS 

The supplements that help me the most were:

1) NAC
2) BETA-ALANINE
3) Fasoracetam (this is controversial but I found a low dose (20mg) was helpful for my anxiety.)
4) Melatonin and valerian root for sleep until I got my supplements from Point of Return. 
 
I purchased a ‚Äúbenzo detox kit‚Äù from the company Point of Return. It was $250 but it was well worth it. You might need 2 because you go through it pretty quick if you follow their instructions, but their customer support is absolutely amazing. Well worth the money IMO. They will walk you through everything, and it made me feel much better knowing I had support from people who knew what I was going through and could instruct me on what to do. 

Their sleep supplements absolutely helped. 

If you can‚Äôt order two full kits, order extra of the melatonin and the cortisol supplement. Those helped me the most. Yes they‚Äôre expensive, but you‚Äôre mainly paying for their services. 

Rule 6: Understand that you are not going to have any permanent brain damage going through this process. I was so fucked up that I thought I had had a stroke, so I said fuck it and was going to kill myself. THIS IS TEMPORARY AND YOU WILL GET THROUGH IT. The brain is extremely powerful and will repair itself. I am honestly back to 100% normal and this process happened just 2 months ago. Follow these rules and you can do it. I went through this process all by myself, and while still going to work everyday. Everyone knew something was up, so if you can, take time off of work. 


If you take anything at all from this, please order Baclofen ASAP. 

Peace‚úåÔ∏èyou got this!


Edit: I abused Phenibut for a relatively short period of time. 

I started using it responsibly in May of this year, started abusing it daily by late June. At that point I was taking 3.5 GPD. 

June to July I started experiencing the weird side effects, and they were the worst in August. I was doing the slow taper, but it fucked with my mind so much that I was forgetting to take my dose, or I was eating after so i wasn‚Äôt receiving the full effects. So I was abusing for about 3 months total, which was the longest 3 months of my life. 

With the weird side effects, I thought that I was tapering too fast, so I went back up to my initial dose. I started implementing the supplements late August and that‚Äôs when things really turned around. 

I didn‚Äôt start to feel completely normal till I got on the Baclofen. I went from 3GPD of Phenibut to 10mg Bac/3x day with no trouble. I was able to taper off of Bac by reducing 5mg every 4 days. I jumped at 5mg per day, which might not work for everyone. You might need to taper lower. 

This stuff affects everyone differently. I got all of the terrible side effects and it was easily the worst experience of my life.",13

Today was the first day I woke up actually feeling like myself. I didn‚Äôt think it would happen, honestly. As an addict, there is ZERO way I can use this substance as it‚Äôs intended and I learned that through this process.

If y‚Äôall have been keeping up with my insanity, thank you for listening. This has legit been my only outlet as nobody in my personal life knows that I‚Äôve been going through this.

I swear the withdrawal off of this hasn‚Äôt been the nightmares that I‚Äôve read on here in terms of seizures and hallucinations‚Ä¶ etc., but it‚Äôs been a fucking mental battle and has completely exacerbated my already-existing anxiety‚Ä¶ specifically health anxiety. The racing heart and palpitations are no joke. The existential dread is REAL. I was only on this substance for three weeks but that was long enough for it to stick its nasty claws into me and let me know how serious it is.

For those looking to try this, respect the drug. If you have addictive personality traits, stay the fuck away.

So glad to be a little over a week free and slowly making progress. If anyone is struggling, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôm here.

Lots of love to you all.",11

It‚Äôs thanksgiving and I‚Äôm about to go to a friend of my mom‚Äôs place to have thanksgiving dinner there. I know almost none of these people and am feeling anxious about the whole thing. Tbh the only saving grace would be if they had a dog or something there for me to pet and keep company. I‚Äôm getting cravings and they keep building up. I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll go away soon. Honestly if there was phenibut in my vicinity that I was aware of rn, I would not hesitate to take it. 

I haven‚Äôt had any phenibut since July 13th of this year, but I still experience cravings every now and then. I‚Äôve also been tapering off my prescription Vyvanse because it could be causing some other issues. I wonder if the Vyvanse taper is having an impact on my cravings. I know both phenibut and Vyvanse increase dopamine in the brain so it makes sense that my Vyvanse withdrawals are impacting my phenibut cravings. I know that both substances can affect motivation, and ever since I started tapering my vyvanse, my motivation has nosedived and I‚Äôve been feeling more empty. I can‚Äôt wait to be rid of it so this doesn‚Äôt keep happening.

I‚Äôve always been a hypochondriac, and coming off of this stuff has truly magnified it by a lot‚Ä¶ but I refuse to go back on it. I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôll deal with the panic attacks and hope that they continue to subside as I put more days between me and this substance.

The Lyrica has helped immensely with the withdrawal symptoms, but in retrospect, certainly hasn‚Äôt eliminated all of them. The racing heart, the fear, the stress‚Ä¶ all of that is still there, although I feel it would be much worse if I were to have not had it.

Check out my previous updates if you‚Äôre curious as to what‚Äôs going on, I won‚Äôt link them this time they‚Äôre on my profile. 

Yesterday ended without incident, just continuing the aggressive beta alinine and agmatine sulfate along with other supps. I found my old lamotrigine script which differs from mine now bc it‚Äôs for 25mg IR tabs, mine is 50mg ER. What I‚Äôm gonna do is start adding a 25mg tablet every night on top of my dose working up to two. Gotta be careful with this med because it can cause ‚Äúthe rash‚Äù which is basically the same as Phenibut turning on you and can turn deadly. So I gotta increase nice amd slow.

So this morning I dropped from 7.4g to 5g. Last night I was a little bit awake so I took 1 10mg baclofen and 1 5mg ambien which put me out for 6 hours. 

Today my behavioral symptoms are more noticeable: I‚Äôm more irritated and anhedonic. Talking with monotone voice, getting an anxiety surge when my phone dings, slight feeling of nothing being as it is. These symptoms are par for the course and frankly, at my dose, I should be borderline seizing right now. 

No physical symptoms to speak of, other than some sweaty feet. Seriously, I don‚Äôt know how either.

I did have ONE small episode this morning where my arms and legs were rhythmically shaking a little bit, but it was also hella cold in here.

Don‚Äôt get it twisted though, I feel okay. Like I‚Äôm still able to laugh and go to the grocery store, etc. for now at least 

I might stabilize at 5 or just keep tapering, who knows. It‚Äôll be a surprise

Take care and happy Thanksgiving",7

I just wanted to update you on the progress of my CT, in case anyone else thought they might try with Pregabilin. ( Lyrica)

I have had no problems yet at all and reducing my pregabilin intake daily too by 300mg. I might be a tiny but shaky and my appetite isn't great but no phenibut in my system has helped my brain return back to normal because I can't tell you how it messed me up in the end.

So, if you can get hold of some Pregabilin, do so. You might just get rid of the monster that is phenibut. I threw the evil shit out yesterday ( full 50g bag) and it will never touch my lips again.

Sending much love to anyone in the same boat as me.

2021-11-23 11:27:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/r0gzl2/update_day_2_of_1213gpd_rapid_taper/,[Update] Day 2 of 12-13gpd rapid taper,"Hey guys,

I posted Sunday about my rapid taper and about how I wanted to try to journal some of my experiences along the way.  Please read my first post if you haven't already to gain the proper context around my situation: [https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qz9562/im\_going\_to\_journal\_my\_rapid\_taper\_starting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qz9562/im_going_to_journal_my_rapid_taper_starting/)

So, to be honest, I don't really have much to say yet.  We're about 50 hours into the taper. The morning after my first post, dropped from 13g to 9g. Just a few hours ago, I dropped from 9g to about 7g. I spent day 1 continuing to supplement my normal regimen, especially Vitamin B-6, Mag, and Fish Oil.  I also have begun taking my lamotrigine 50mg at night instead of morning, because since I dose in the morning, I'm more likely to experience glutamate surges at night and lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant designed to stop shaking in its tracks. Further, it actually somehow works on GABA-a receptors which is a nice bonus. (go, go, go, gooooooo lamotrigine!!!).

I added the beta-alinine I ordered into my regimen 3 times per day at 3.2g. Just a side note, if you want to try beta, DO NOT drink it all at once in true addict fashion.  You will suffer from the most uncomfortable, but harmless, but still uncomfortable pins and needles all over your body that don't go away for half an hour or so. Finally, my agmatine sulfate came in the mail and I have been dosing that at 1.2g 3 times per day, but with one dose specifically 15 minutes before my Phenibut dose.

Now, about withdraw symptoms. Right now there are almost none that are anything but child's play, but that's for a couple reasons:

1. high dose dependent phenibut users have consistently seen positive results by slashing their initial dose, sometimes in half, all at once. I've noticed this is helpful in those experiencing glutamate storms, but I'm not sure that applies to me because I have not had a single surge in glutamate since this started.
2. high dose dependent phenibut users also tend to not experience the more debilitating physical symptoms until after the 3rd day of withdraw. Granted, when I had to CT at 10gpd the few times I did (only until my next shipment arrived usually at 48 hrs), I began feeling WD consistently at 36 hours. Meaning, either my glutamate production is extremely downregulated right now OR the method of my taper is having some benefit to my body.

That being said, I am experiencing SOME symptoms, obviously.  I still cut my dose almost in half in two days.  The main things now are:

* sweating in the most uncomfortable places: GABA WD has this way of making you uncomfortable in the strangest ways possible, such as sweating in between your little toes and on your palms.
* shakiness in the hands: in the morning especially
* general heightened anxiety: but no primal fear or impending doom, and no uncontrollable panic attacks (yet)
* nerve pain in the feet: again, these damn feet. So Phenibut WD causes my feet to weirdly ache at the bone level, as if ligaments attached to the bone are spasming around them. Also the occasional needle in the tip of my big toe, which feels like literally being poked by a thumbtack. Ouch
* minor anhedonia: recall that phenibut also has an effect on the increase in dopamine, so WD tends to be accompanied with depression and the general inability to feel pleasure. I have been combatting this with engulfing myself in YouTube videos that comfort me and video games. Namely, I spent 6 hours yesterday trying to BootCamp my Mac to run PCSX2, a Playstation 2 emulator. Then I spent another few hours trying to source and patch Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne. Finally, after trials and tribulations, I am sitting in front of my MacBook running a PlayStation 2 on it and playing with a dualshock wireless controller. Pretty cool stuff.

I want to stress how important the ""little things"" are in WD. This includes your set, setting, the people you are around, how clean your room is, the lighting, etc. My room is candlelit with a big ass tv to watch, nice and simple. Like a little sanctuary. I'm also with my family who knows about this stuff (as much as they can at least). However, they will be leaving tomorrow and coming back Saturday, so I will need to be more cautious with this taper going forward and may start dipping into scripts tmmrw.

I spent yesterday relaxing mostly, I cleaned the kitchen completely for my mom and did some chores since I'm home for break. Today, my only objective is to take my basset hound to the groomer (walking) like 0.2 miles away. Gotta get those nails cut and come home after. I also am gonna straighten up my room and do laundry. Might not seem like much to the reader, but these little things are ESSENTIAL to maintaining a healthy psyche during WD.

Another thing I have not mentioned at all: exercise. I am 180lbs 5'8"" and I have lifted weights for a couple years now. I recently started boxing and training martial arts too, like Taekwondo and Wing Chun. Great releases for the negative energy deep inside. Good old fashion cardio is nice too. Sometimes, back when I was tapering a couple years ago, my HR would hit 160 just casually watching tv. I would get so worried and finally I was like you know what, fuck you body. Let's see just how much trouble you're really in here. I'd go run a 8 minute mile which sent my HR up to about 210 or so for 10 minutes. After I'd be laughing to myself like yeah.. you really are all bark no bite huh. You did just fine when it actually counted. So yeah, it's all in your head. Well, 85% of it maybe.

I still have my 15 10mg baclofen and I've been taking my lamotrigine as prescribed. I also may or may not have found an old script of 5mg Ambien my Mom got in 2014. She said I could use it if I really couldn't sleep. Recall that Ambien, a Z drug, also acts as if it's a benzo.  But one thing that scares me about Ambien is the affinity for hallucinations it causes, along with blackouts. It might be dangerous to take Ambien after being awake for a night or two during WD, especially if physical symptoms are high. If yall do this, keep that in mind. As for me, I plan to use the Ambien more-so on the nights when I DO feel I can sleep, as this will probably actually cause me to sleep. Also, I'm refraining from doses higher than 10mg ever, and probably just 5mg.

Yeah honestly, the most troubling thing right now is the sweating on the bottom of my feet and in between my toes. I'll keep everyone updated. If I start to change state tonight, which is VERY possible as we are approaching the 72 hour cusp, I'll update. If I feel the same, I'll try to update tomorrow morning after my next dose.

Happy Thanksgiving to all and stay strong! Comment or message me for questions.

Does this seem reasonable to continue?  Any thoughts on whether I will need to go more slowly as I get closer to zero?  I read someone recommend that you go the last mile at 50mg/day, so I thought it might be relatively painless to do it the entire way, and I have nothing but time.",2

For those that don‚Äôt know, phenibut obtains it‚Äôs effects by being a voltage gated calcium channel blocker which reduces glutamate levels (It‚Äôs also a GABA-B agonist) - But the primary withdrawal effects come from it blocking calcium channels (or lack thereof)

Glutamate is the primary excitatory chemical in our brain, and high glutamate levels = stress, anxiety, etc. Glutamate also has other purposes such as being a secondary messenger for 70+% of other neurotransmission (Dopamine, norepinephrine, etc) 

Glutamate attaches to glutamate receptors and agonizes it, and once it attaches to the receptor it causes it‚Äôs effects as it‚Äôs an agonist. 

While in phenibut withdrawal you have an extreme excess amount of glutamate, which results in an excess of glutamate receptor activation, which = anxiety, stress, impending doom (withdrawal) etc.

Memantine works by binding to the glutamate receptors so glutamate can‚Äôt, and acts as an antagonist rather than an agonist (Antagonists block the effect)

So essentially you could have a tremendous amount of glutamate from the withdrawal, but the glutamate has no receptors to attach to as their all being blocked by memantine and therefor cannot illicit a response, and therefor cannot cause withdrawal.

So essentiallierer: Glutamate bad. Glutamate cause withdrawal. Memantine block glutamate.

I‚Äôm picking some up right now to taper off gabapentin (which I used to quit phenibut)

In addition, the supplement NAC can eliminate excess glutamate as well. So using both in unison might be very beneficial as Memantine can block the receptors, and NAC can eliminate the excess glutamate.",7

I feel ashamed and scared and angry and a lot more because quitting Phenibut is not something I can do on my own. I don't have the strength to taper my Phenibut use like many people here on this platform did. Respect to those and i genuinely wish you all the very best.

&#x200B;

I consider myself lucky that I live in a country were the option for a Clinical Detoxification is always there and since Phenibut is finally a substance that the addiction health care has experience in/with including Detoxing patients with Phenibut Addiction, I decided that it's my only option to quit Phenibut completely after a 3 year addiction of daily Phenibut use (**10+ GPD**).  


I feel ashamed mostly because compared to what many others had to go trough, I will be having a very safe (I'm not saying easy tho..) and professional detox. But I'm scared AF ! I will be detoxed from years of Phenibut use in aprox. 10 days. (!)

Nowhere on the internet can I find any report/ example/ topic of somebody that has been detoxed from Phenibut with GHB. And that makes me so anxious.  
I'll be getting the equivalent of Phenibut replaced with GHB every 2 or 3 hours (also at night, which is good).   
 It just drives me crazy that there's not a single article anywhere, where they use GHB in detox to detox Phenibut.

And I know, I get it. It's basically the same, the whole molecule is almost, almost identical to GHB. But still, I'm so scared. The idea of no more Phenibut and than every two hours GHB, I'm so scared that I will go trough hell, or worse.  


I've been to detox 3 times before. 6 years ago was the last time. And all those detoxes were GHB. So GHB got tapered with GHB. So I know how it goes. However, it's a long-working version of GHB, Phenibut that I am addicted to. Not GHB. 

&#x200B;

And I don't want to smuggle all kinds of benzos and phenibut and you-name-it into that clinic. Because been there done that. It's not helping. It's making it worse. So if i go to Detox. It will be me. and no single drug or medication.

&#x200B;

Does anybody have, or have seen any report or experience online about a individual addicted to Phenibut being detoxed and tapered with GHB.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry I'm just so f.kng scared..

There's a lot more going on but this for now is really what's making my panic and anxiety even worse and that leads relatively often to the use of extra phenibut and I try desperately to taper the phenibut just a little before I go to Detox.

Please do not comment until you have read my entire post. Many on this sub see anything other than a slow taper and armchair in the comments.,"NOTE: A slow and extended taper is the proper way to stop taking Phenibut. Cold-turkey or rapid tapers can result in dangerous consequences for some people.

I posted the other day about quitting my 12-13gpd habit cold-turkey, and after some thought I‚Äôve decided to change my approach. I plan on doing a rapid taper over the next 10 days. I have 10 days to withdraw in peace before I need to get back to my busy life. I highly doubt it‚Äôs feasible to completely be off Phenibut by the end of the period, but I‚Äôd like to at least be at a more reasonable dose, as low as I can get, before slow tapering. Who knows though, it might go better than expected.

I have worked my way up to 12-13gpd from about 4-6gpd over the last year. I was previously on Phenibut 2 years ago at 4gpd and successfully slow tapered 50mg per day (no supplements) before stupidly taking it again. I have made it to day 3 about 7 times over the last few months due to money problems at ~10gpd without much issue, other than normal withdraw symptoms. I have experience with other substances too. A couple months ago I decided to cold-turkey 45gpd kratom habit (2 years daily) and 150mg Effexor ER (1 year daily) at the same time, and made it through after a BRUTAL two weeks. Phenibut is my last stop before being free of all substances.

I am not doing this without preparation. I have been supplementing my body with the following for the past few days:

- Ionic Magnesium (high dose, minor NMDA antagonism and anxiolytic)
- L-Arginine (minor NMDA antagonism, vasodilation)
- Taurine (glutamate suppression)
- Fish oil (cardiovascular health)
- Vitamin C (megadose, NMDA antagonism)
- Vitamin B6 (glutamate suppression, promotes GABA production)
- Valerian Root (GABA production, sleep support)
- Potassium gluconate (Phenibut has been shown to deplete Potassium)
- Kava Kava (GABA production, anxiolytic)
- Multivitamins (because why the hell not)

I also have two prescriptions to aid in this process: 15 10mg baclofen, and 50mg lamotrigine ER, an anticonvulsant that treats epilepsy (thus preventing seizures) and also coincidentally upregulates GABA production.

You might be wondering: where the hell is Agmatine sulfate?? Well, the answer is simple: I forgot to order it and I have some coming tomorrow. Agmatine is the ultimate NMDA antagonist and is ESSENTIAL for any tapering or withdraw from Phenibut. 

I also picked up some beta-alinine today. There is an anecdotal report on this sub of a man who (god bless him) purposefully got addicted to 20gpd just to test his theory of beta-alinine for withdraw. He concluded that JUST beta-alinine (3-6 gram doses, 3 or so times per day) resulted in the COMPLETE alleviation of physical withdraw symptoms. Pharmacokinetics are unknown.

For those not in the know, you might be wondering what NMDA antagonism means. Here‚Äôs a summary:

While excessive levels of glutamate result in neurotoxicity, in part through the over-activation of NMDARs, NMDA antagonists block the NMDA glutamate receptors to normalize the glutamatergic system and ameliorate cognitive and memory deficits.

In English, glutamate is the counterpart to GABA, which work hand in hand to regulate many neural functions. Phenibut releases GABA. However, at high doses or during withdraw, one will experience a surge in glutamate production due to the lack of GABA, coined by the Phenibut community as ‚Äúglutamate storm.‚Äù A surge in glutamate causes cells to become overly excited to the point of cell death, and since glutamate exists (sort of) in between cells, the death of cells causes more glutamate to spread between even more cells in a positive feedback loop known as ‚Äúexicitotoxicity,‚Äù which is partially responsible for many medical conditions, including Alzheimer‚Äôs.

Luckily, we have a glorious solution to this problem in the form of NMDA antagonists, which downregulate glutamate production and in turn lowers tolerance to Phenibut, thus increasing subjective effects and minimizing stress during taper or withdraw.

I plan on cutting my dose in half tomorrow, stabilizing for 2-3 days, and dropping from there as I see fit. I have about 100 grams of Phenibut on hand in case shit hits the fan.

I will be with my family for the first three days, who all know about this stuff, then just my step-dad until the weekend when my mom and brother return from their trip. 

I also just want to say that an important part of quitting Phenibut is being brave. It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy to withdraw from something. No disrespect, but many on this sub are VERY dramatic. You can accomplish anything with enough determination and courage, along with careful planning and backup planning.

Stay tuned this week for my posts, I might miss a day or two but I‚Äôll try to keep everyone updated so you guys can see what it‚Äôs like and hear my anecdotal experience. I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving. Despite going through withdraw, I will do my best to be thankful for everything I have in",14

I had only been using for around three weeks at varying doses, but the last week went from 3,000 to 2,000 to 1,500 to 1,000 and then 250 yesterday.

I didn‚Äôt want to do a long, drawn out taper as I haven‚Äôt been on this drug for that long of a time.

Lyrica seems to be helping immensely. So does the Propranalol. I naturally have a high heart rate and this has kept it at around 80-90 bpm the past two days.

I was able to put together six hours of sleep last night with the help of chamomile tea and Trazodone. I think the Lyrica helps too because whenever I‚Äôm on it, I sleep beautifully.

If you just now realized you're in a deep deep hole, i think this will help you:

A few months back i was happily living in denial, thinking that because I was taking phenibut every other day, i wasnt hooked...  oops.. then one day i went 48 hours without it, 
And the withrawals began to set in.  Cant describe how awful it is.  But i dont mean to scare you.. this story has a happy ending!

First, allow me to say that a couple years ago i went thru kratom withdrawals. Like most of you here, ive been attempting to self-medicate a problem that i need to deal with.    Kratom withdrawals are horrific. The worst 3 days of my life...   phenibut is much much worse.   The reason why i dont say phenibut was the worst days of my life is because I bailed on quitting cold turkey.   Phenibut withdrawals feel straight up dangerous.  Please dont quit cold turkey if you are in a deep hole!

Once i realized i was in a hole, the very next step was to find out the minimum amount that i can take and still feel good.
This was a little tricky to find because i was taking it every other day.. unfortunately, it seems that you cant tapper down by taking a smaller amount every other day.. the only thing that happens is you go into withdrawal sooner.

I figured i was taking roughly 12-14 grams every other say, 
So i guesstimated that if i switched to taking it daily, somewhere around 7 grams would probably be enough.

First, you gotta find an amount you can take and feel normal.
In my case it was indeed 7 grams... then i continued taking 7 grams per day for 4-5 days to ensure that i wasnt going to hit a wall at some point.

After i confirmed 7 grams per day, i then had to find out how much to take out.    I wanted to avoid suffering as much as possible, so instead of removing like half a gram and putting up with feeling shitty until my body caught up,  i instead decided to remove a tiny bit DAILY.

I began very conservagive and began removing .05 a day.
After 2 weeks im this protocol I felt COMPLETELY NORMAL, so normal that i wondered if i could go a little faster.

I then began removing .10 a day.  I was fine for a few days, then like 5 days later i began feeling a little off.   So i went back to .05.

Later i decided to try somewhere in between... i gave 0.07 a try... same result, i was fine for a while and then began feeling weird.

So here it is my friends:   remove 0.05 each day, and you'll feel normal thruout.  It doesnt sound like much, but you'll be removing  1.55 grams in a 31 day month!

Just to make sure everyone is on the same page:  0.05 is NOT half a  gram. There is a 0 before the 5

Besides that, id recommend that you make sure you realize how fortunate you are to get out of this horrible mess so relatively easy! I feel so fortunate myself that im sure i wont dig myself in anything this dumb again.

The only downside to this is just how expensive it is.
It does get pricey... but worth it.  We digged ourselves into this mess.. now we gotta pay the piper.

If money is an issue for you, i would recommend you tell your friends and family. Im sure people would be down to help you.   Heck, start a fund raiser and ill throw a few bucks your way...   for your well being it is worth to spend the money on this and not put yoursel thru the withdrawals.

Also dont forget to come here and try to help out others by sharing your success story!   If i was able to help you in any way, id love to hear about it too!

If anyone has any questions for me, let me know!

Good luck!

EDIT: I Should add that when i started at 7 grams per day, i took it in split doses...  3.5  in the morning,  3.5  three hours later.  When i began taperint down it looked like this:

Day one:  dose one. 3.45.    Dose two. 3.50

Day two:  dose one  3.45.   Dose two  3.45

Day three :   dose one 3.40.  Dose two  3.45

Day four:  dose one 3.40.  Dose two : 3.40

The answer is; not that much worse.

Your body just upregulates glutamate when you‚Äôre on Gabaergics. They stop doing **anything** very quickly.

The only difference between then and now is that I‚Äôm on the ketogenic diet which raises gaba and lowers glutamate. It also releases agmatine in the brain which is an NMDA antagonist. Further lowering glutamate activity.

The constant attempt to minimise the glutamate storms while continuing to participate in society and pretend I‚Äôm not experiencing such effects.

I‚Äôve attempted everything imaginable to decrease my dose, whether by increasing the timeframe or lowering the amount; I even tried transitioning to F-Phenibut (due to its longer half-life).

I supplement with Memantine, Agmatine Sulphate, NAC, Magnesium L-Threonate and ALCAR also.

However, no matter what I attempt, I‚Äôm always back to square one.

My current dose of Baclofen‚Äôs 40mg every two hours. I had reduced this down to 38mg; however, out of nowhere, I experienced the horrendous Glutamate storms and couldn‚Äôt function again. While at one point, this was 47mg, every 1hr 30mins.

The side effects I experience (during a Glutamate surge):

-	Cartoon-like experience of reality, everything seems alien, feels like I‚Äôm experiencing similarities to being on psychedelics. As if I‚Äôve teleported to a different planet.
-	Perception is warped. Other people, seem strange and their voices honestly sound like a cartoon characters. I‚Äôve got no other way of describing this, but it‚Äôs fucking awful and scary.
-	Cognitive issues, memory is impaired. Less efficient/slow while doing activities/tasks.
-	Vision issues, my vision could become blurry, and it‚Äôs difficult to read/hard to focus on things.

Reducing by 1mg causes the reminisce of these effects by the following day. I‚Äôm honestly out of options and considering ending my life.

----

I even began using Diazepam because it somewhat reduced the effects I was experiencing. However, never in a million years do I want to continue taking Benzodiazepines or risk further dependence.

I was using Diazepam (10mg) at one point, every 4 hours- this is where I managed to get my Baclofen dose down to 35mg. Initially, I believed this was helpful; however, now I was creating an additional dependence.

It‚Äôs been a few regrettable months (4-5), using Benzodiazepines to hide from the reality of the situation. Therefore, I‚Äôm attempting to taper this currently. However, I‚Äôm still left with continuing this high Baclofen dose, something I don‚Äôt want.

In terms of the Diazepam, I‚Äôm currently reducing this every three days. Each reduction is being achieved by further increasing the timeframe of the dose. 

For example:
12th - 14th (6hrs)
15th - 17th (8hrs)
18th - 20th (10hrs)

Therefore, increasing in two-hour intervals, every three days. I‚Äôm unaware if this is the best protocol; however, from short dependencies previously, increasing the timeframe until I got to 72hrs between doses (and then quitting cold turkey) was what I found to work best for me in the past.

I‚Äôm unaware if I could reduce faster, as this current protocol entails being on Diazepam for a longer duration. By December 9th, my dose should be every 24hrs. I don‚Äôt know if the taper could then be reduced at a faster rate.",6

I Redosed 4 grams yesterday and It screwed me so hard. It‚Äôs ridiculous,"Like I said I‚Äôve been tapering for 4 weeks. I‚Äôve done this before many times and my way of tapering is jumping down 0.5 grams every 10 days. I‚Äôll go from 4 grams to 3.5 grams in one day, then do the same thing for 10 days. I feel normal within a few days and ‚Äúcoast‚Äù at that level for 6-7 days so I feel totally regular before jumping down another .5 grams again.

The key of doing it the way I do is to take my last 0.5 gram dose of the day right before bed so I can actually sleep. Then I sleep great. Don‚Äôt take your last dose of the day at 5 pm. Hold out on your last dose of the day until you‚Äôre literally going to bed. Even if it‚Äôs a half of your regular dose.

Anyways I was getting a little off subject there it it‚Äôs something everyone here needs to know just for reference.

# Heres the main message of this post ‚Äî
I took 4 grams yesterday (1 gram doses every 3-4 hours), and I feel like absolute shit today. It‚Äôs 1 pm already and I still feel like shit. I feel waaay shittier than if I only took 1.5 grams instead of 3 grams. So be careful people. More isn‚Äôt always better. Some days I think taking 1 more gram will make my day better, but it fucks me over for about 3 days after that. I‚Äôll feel like a have a speedy neurotic kind of mentality just by taking that extra gram and feel weird and more anxious than normal, so it doesn‚Äôt actually cure my anxiety like I think it will.

Hope you‚Äôre all doing ok today. I have been on Phenibut for about a year give or take, I started a couple years ago and progressed to 6 gpd before successfully tapering painlessly. This time around, gradually over the course of a year, I have worked my way up to 12.5 gpd. 

I have a period of 10 days coming up where I will have very little responsibility, except working a full day on day 7. I‚Äôve decided it‚Äôs time to kick it for good. 

I am no stranger to debilitating withdrawal: I cold turkeyed 50 gpd kratom habit and 150 mg Effexor XR at the same time about 2 months ago bc I got so sick of the side effects of both. It was BRUTAL for 2 weeks but I made it out much happier. I also have stopped all drinking and Rec. drug use. This Phenibut is all that‚Äôs left holding me back.

The way I see it, I have two choices: either rapidly taper over the 10 days, or cold turkey from day 1.

I have: 20 10mg Baclofen and 30 lamotrigine 50mg ER tablets (anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer that prevents seizures). I have also some ashwaganda, beta Alinine. I COULD get some agmatine but I‚Äôm low on cash rn. I don‚Äôt have money to blow on withdrawal supplies.

Keep in mind I have made it to day 3/4 many times on a high daily dose due to simply running out of money. It was shit but I survived.

I‚Äôm not the type who is easily fearful or intimidated: I have a plethora of painful drug experiences under my belt. That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt be posting here if I wasn‚Äôt uncertain.

I know this was all a mistake and I‚Äôve faced my past decisions. All that‚Äôs left is to take action (or rather, take the inaction of dosing).

So what do you think? Will I make it?? How should I do this?

Edit: also, to copy what I wrote below, I‚Äôll be with my family throughout this. My mom knows what Phenibut is from what I‚Äôve told her. My brother has minor autism so he doesn‚Äôt really feel empathy or understand my problems, but he is my best friend and gaming buddy and he‚Äôs always there when it counts.",5

I have no rebound effects and was wondering if I should maybe start at 800 mg and do a slow taper because the cold turkey was not pleasant to say the least. I think I may have reset my body by quitting for those six days and might be able to take 800 mg one time per day and then slowly taper down. What do you guys think? Should I just keep going on ct, or start at the 800 mg mark and work my way down from here. Any response would be a big help. Oh and I also have a whole bunch of supplements to help such as NAC, agmatine, lemon balm, l theanine and Ashwagandha. Thank you so much phenibut family üòä

Edit: I also have been using clonazolam for when the anxiety gets to be too much. I am in no way recommending this, this is just what helps for me personally.",2

Then use gabapentin or baclofen to ride out the withdrawals and then stop them altogether. I'm not planning to be on either drug for longer than periods of 5 or 6 days (I'll see how it goes) in an attempt to prevent the development of dependence, but I will be switching back and forth between the two until I've finished the process of coming off phenibut. My question is, is the interval of 5 or 6 days enough to prevent the build up of tolerance to those drugs or am I still risking becoming physically addicted in that time frame? Will I just end up with gabapentin or baclofen withdrawals at the end?",2

Here's the link:
https://old.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/pc7351/i_just_found_out_i_have_covid_and_im_on_a/

Unfortunately, about 8 days after making that post I felt much worse and I had to go to the ER. I could barely even walk to the car without having to stop every few feet to catch my breath. I won't go into too much detail but I wanted to tell this story, specifically about how the hospital handled the phenibut situation, in case someone ends up in a similar position.

I brought a bag of phenibut capsules with me, which probably wasn't too smart because they weren't labeled at all. I should have brought the bottle. I also brought a case report about phenibut addiction. I didn't say anything about it at first until I was situated in one of the bays. Then I told the nurse about it and gave him the paper. He told me I should give him the bag of pills so he could show the pharmacist and get it evaluated by them, and then he'd give it back to me in five minutes. ""I promise"" he said.

I agreed but I took a handful of capsules and said I'd hang onto them just in case something goes wrong. But then he insisted that I give him all of them. At that point I knew there was at least a strong possibility that he'd confiscate them, because it made no sense that he needed every single one just to show the pharmacist, but I felt I had no choice. Again he assured me ""five minutes, I'll bring it right back.""

40 minutes later, he came back with the pharmacist as they explained that they couldn't give me back the pills as long as I was under their care. They said it was because phenibut isn't FDA approved and it has no official medical use in this country. My only option to get them back was to check out of the hospital, which wasn't an option for me.

They assured me that they would give me some other benzo to help ease the withdrawal if I needed it. I asked when they could give it to me because I was already starting to feel it. She explained that phenibut withdrawal doesn't start until 72 hours after the last dose so I should be perfectly fine until then, lol. I was like ""no, it starts a lot earlier than that for me."" Her legit response was ""no it doesn't. I'm a pharmacist so I know."" I mean she probably never heard of phenibut until five minutes ago when she read that case report and now she thinks she's an expert, enough to contradict my own and hundreds of others' experiences. Unbelievable. So that's the kind of stuff I was dealing with.

Later on the shift change happened a new staff came in. I tried to ask my new nurse a question about the other benzos I was supposed to be getting, but he had no idea what I was talking about. Apparently the other nurse didn't even bother to enter anything into the computer about it, so now I had to explain it all over again to all new people. Luckily the new doctors were willing to give me something earlier than the people from the previous shift, but they still never brought it. I waited hours after it was supposedly ""on its way"" from the pharmacy. I know hospitals can be really slow with stuff but this I had never experienced before. Then they moved me to a regular hospital room, but then I had to explain the situation again to all new nurses and people on that floor.

I think it was about 36 hours after I first arrived when they finally gave me some Ativan. I don't know how much it was, but it didn't seem to do anything. By that point I was having some pretty bad anxiety. I would see scary images when I would close my eyes. The wrinkles in my bedsheets all seemed to form the shape of scary faces, weird stuff like that. I was also awake this entire time by the way. I couldn't sleep at all. Later another doctor switched me to baclofen. It helped a little bit but I think the dose was probably too low.

By this point my oxygen saturation started going down to the mid-80s. I had been on oxygen since entering the hospital but now they wanted to put a different kind of mask on me. I don't remember this but apparently I didn't react very well to it and I had a panic attack of some kind and they had to restrain me. I don't know if that panic attack was from the phenibut withdrawal, a side effect of some of the other medication they gave me, or from low oxygen, or something else. But anyway they ended up putting me on a ventilator which I stayed on for three weeks. I had a long recovery but I'm doing a lot better now and according to the ICU doctors I'm lucky to have survived.

So yeah, that's one way to quit phenibut. I tried to exclude any unnecessary details that weren't relevant to the phenibut stuff, but at least now you know what to (possibly) expect if you're in a similar situation. I'd recommend doing your best to quit the phenibut before you have to get treated for something in a hospital.

**TL;DR:** Brought phenibut to the hospital, explained what it was, but they confiscated it and wouldn't let me use it. They promised other benzos to help the withdrawal symptoms but it was a bureaucratic nightmare trying to get them. Try not to rely on the hospital to know how to deal with your phenibut addiction.",23

I cut my dose drastically everyday over the course of 6 days and things got much better everyday.

I have struggled with Phenibut on and off over the last 2 years and recently decided to get off, hopefully for good this time. I have been dosing daily for the last 11 months and I was up to \~7 GPD spread out over the course of the day and was really struggling with anxiety nearly all day.  I noticed something though when I ran out about 3 weeks ago when a shipment was delayed, the first day I slept all day and the 2nd was when I started to get anxiety and depression to where I didn't want to get out of bed.  When I was on the 7 GPD I would have the anxiety but I would feel almost hypomanic throughout the day.  I would be super sweaty all day, started having anxiety anywhere from 6-10 hours since my last dose, and the worst of it was I would have the worst sleep apnea when I did finally sleep.  I started thinking what if I was constantly having too much glutamate from taking too much. So the 1st day I got my shipment in I took 7 g spaced out and felt the same way. So the next day I took 6 g and felt slightly better, 3rd day 5 g, 4th day 4 g in 2 g doses, 5th day 3 g in one dose, and 6th day 2.1 g.  It was weird but everyday I felt progressively better and by the 7th day I had no anxiety when I woke up and even felt some euphoria and the socialness was definitely back.  I stuck to 2.1 g for 4 days just to make sure I wasn't going to go through some delayed withdrawal but it seems I had found the sweet spot. Since then I have tapered down to 1.5g and haven't had any anxiety but have finally started feeling a little depressed throughout the day, it's almost a relief though seeing as I was always spun up throughout the day and constantly having anxiety.  Sorry for the long post I just wanted to let people know that sometimes, for me at least, taking too much can mimic withdrawals. I am by no means recommending anyone to go this route, I'm just letting people know what worked for me. Oh and I forgot to add the only other thing I have been using was  2 1.5 g doses of NAC daily, morning and evening, however I had been doing this for the last 4 months or so trying to taper to no avail.

And more broadly, I‚Äôm also interested in those who have drank after quitting benzos for the same reason. 

I ask this because shortly prior to ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô getting dependent on pheni (which I will explain shortly), I had drank 4 beers one day (hadn‚Äôt drank in years prior to that), and the next day I was not only experiencing hangover but lots of anxiety and almost panic attacks. It was bad enough that I couldn‚Äôt leave the house that day, and that was abnormal for me. I had drank heavily (average a bottle of wine per day) for a few months out of a year a couple years past, but I never had withdrawals so kindling just doesn‚Äôt make sense, although that‚Äôs all I could point a finger on. 

As for getting hooked on pheni, I was always very cautious and never wavered from my dosing pattern of taking between 900mg-1.5g max every 4th day. I did this from 2015 to 2019 (never even had a rebound), then didn‚Äôt take it for two years. Until 2021 that is, around a week after my alcohol experience. I restarted at the same pattern, and after max 3 weeks I was in withdrawal (long story short). Even though my use was not excessive at all (same as before), I had terrible waves of hours-long panic attacks and dread, suicidal thoughts and absolute metallic fear following the first week where I thought I had the flu, until they gradually went away over a month and a half. 

Basically, I have no idea why my body reacted to both alcohol and pheni in the way it did, as it would suggest I had some kindling going on, despite the fact that I‚Äôd never experienced any withdrawal from both substances and had taken a very long break from both.

Sorry for this confuddled post, any thoughts, comments and experiences that may shine a light on any point in this post would be great as this has stumped me for the past 4 months. I would like to be able to drink occasionally in social settings, and use the very odd benzo to calm a bad psychedelic trip if absolutely necessary. I‚Äôam now very careful about anything that acts on GABA, even chamomile.

Always, always check the ingredients. If it says it contains GABA, it might actually be phenibut under a different name. I wouldn‚Äôt wish the symptoms I experienced on my worst enemy.

The biggest hurdle for me is not being myself with my girlfriend around. She knows that I take phenibut and also knows that I have been trying to taper, but I get angsty and completely lose my sex drive as soon as I start lowering my dose, which isnt fun for either of us.

I've found that phenylpiracetam helps a lot with the libido aspect of things, but makes me more easily frustrated and sometimes more anxious. I've also tried maca for libido and seems like it's hit or miss depending on the day.

I also only have phenibut capsules at 0.25g per capsule, so tapering slower than 0.25g at a time isn't an immediate option.

I've read some stuff on here about fasoracetam helping with W/D but I also read that it's a bad idea to combine with phenibut and I'm not sure I can go cold turkey.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm inspired by all of you who have successfully quit and am so tired of the constant anxiety of ""did I remember to bring my bottle with me"" or ""what if I can't get a shipment in on time.""",3

2021-11-11 13:43:53,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qrryin/update_on_someone_who_jumped_to_high_dose/,Update on someone who jumped to high dose baclofen from at least 3g but hopped between 1-3g and 4-6 maybe higher during 2 years straight using phen. Lowest was 750mg one day when I was tapering but I'd end up raising back and forth. No phenibut for 2 weeks at least!,"Long post:

So my taper was like 5 days of 3g after really binging  at least 6g+ went through a lot during and.weird time in my life.   I have been trying to get my shit together a long time and got myself on benzos, way deeper into kratom (bought a kilo of good enhanced I would combine with a very potent strain I always buy from the same place) and at once point in the last year could take 10g kratom and 1g phenibut and probably be fine.  I quickly ruined all that but the phenibut HCl is so toxic to me I have wanted off of it longer than anything.  I get loose stools, intense stomach pain and farts if I dose at the wrong time or like combine a stupid huge 10g kratom dose with 2g phenibut on an empty stomach without eating.  Gave me anal fissures where you have bright red blood in the toilet from a scar that reopens when you poop. I just dealt with it for months, because I read it's not directly harmful.  Clearly though something wasn't right..

I think first day I had baclofen I took 750mg phen and maybe 50mg baclofen and slept super long.  I am also tapering kratom again back to 18-26g daily but it's more about strains half the time. I can wean on the same dose by changing the ratio. Or if I have to dose to sleep,  I'll take my white Thai or red bali and it's like an alarm clock 8hrs later.   But my dose switched from the enhanced with 6g to 10-12g 3-5c daily and I was abusing ephedrine (lol) with modafinil (only way I focused through this post

WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS 
But my first few days went like this
1: 75-100mg idk really but it was way too much

2:75-90mg it was over a few doses just going on symptoms and that's when I thought it would be EASY as cake even after 2 years building in my system.  

3: similar dose, less relief. Still sleeping pretty heavy because I took a late dose usually.  And not sleeping until the early morning.  This may be when I made my post where I thought I was all good and going t keep dosing what I need to get off the HCl poison. 

Days 4-7: it did hit me.  I kept the phenibut away and dosed etiz or kratom a little higher when things got bad but there were times when more baclofen was my onlyrelief.  I was trying to wean it at this point but stopped that. No 100mg bac doses but like 75mg for a few days, 50mg at once just to be able to leave the house.  I had fucking suicidal thoughts like everyone mentions, and my life situation is fucked right now so I need to be functional somewhat but I wasn't.  I was incredibly confused and trying to clean my place almost looping in circles, forgetting what I was doing, lots of the extremely negative feelings people have mentioned definitely got better after morning but it was strange.  And I had the luxury of taking more baclofen or kratom or D8 extract (amazing stuff has helped so many ways) Etizolam even though I am trying to wean and avoid really bad dependence which I've found is very dependent on if you are on longer vs dose in my experience, but I am getting control over that and unfortunately benzos ruin me but also help me.  Tends to ruin me when I take free samples and get the ""fun ones"".  Which is how this started with some opioid I never would have touched in my right mind reading reviews because I was physically sick and coughing and it was pretty good stuff effects wise.  That got me to buy enhanced kratom a whole kilo which made me nod out and tolerance skyrocket.  

Anyway

2 OR WEEKS OF NO PHENIBUT dose baclofen usually 1x per day, yesterday was one, 25-30mg dose (scale is shitty, I do the trick where you weigh something then add but still don't trust.   But I don't need the exact dose.)   I think you can get addicted and manic on this stuff too but that's every GABAb I have tried.  Lyrica, GHB group, even gabapentin all do this. But baclofen would make you sleep.  Today I'll try 25mg once then melatonin etiz, and kratom to sleep. I also took antihistamine sleep meds like hydroxyzine and doxylamine succinate (1/3 of a 25mg pill) and realized they were adding to how I felt waking up and was oversleeping.  But it would allow me to skip kratom doses sometimes too because I'd wake up deep in it 10+ hours after last kratom dose, made it 12 a few times.  But that's a different thing.   

Anyway I'm like 2 or 3 weeks off phenibut idk exact date and don't care.   I have spent a lot of times on forums and subs overthinking and feeling worse, or accepting everything users comment as truth.    

Also if what they say is true I'm pretty much off. Baclofen has a short half life, I am wary of these considering phenibuts is apparently 8hrs and the baclofen makes me sleep heavy taken late.  I will have a ton left over.    GHB/GBL it's clear because you wake up in a rebound state needing to dose after 3-4hrs and this is how it's prescribed.  I don't think I'm out of the woods yet but honestly might be.  The kratom wean could be my main issue.

I have posted a lot here and definitely think people can reduce doses faster still.  Some people may require a structured wean but if you're going to do this, stick with it.  I really believe if you want to get off something fast you should weigh stuff but always have these goals:  (NOT SUGGESTING FOR BENZOS OR GABAA DRUGS WITH PROVEN HISTORY OF SEIZURES)

1) What's the least I can take to feel relief for a few hours?  

2) Can I go an extra 2 hours, 1 hr, 15 minutes before my next dose?
  --If all signs are good go to sleep early and skip a dose.  (Phenibut dose changes won't be felt for a few days.  Placebo/anticipation of the worst gets people here)

3) if on a high dose you can reduce much much faster to start.  I've read thousands of posts probably about this drug and the people who have issues and end up in ER are cold turkey from insane doses. And sometimes it's not long term so it's hard to tell what is rebound vs withdrawal.   They go into delirium but NO VERIFIED REPORTS OF SEIZURES  which are typically the GABAa drugs Anyway. 

4) baclofen works and I see people discourage it but it's abuse potential is so much lower than phenibut and makes you so sleepy idk why you would abuse it.

5)10mg baclofen = 1g phenibut is from a single case study.  5g phenibut to 50mg max baclofen wouldn't be the worst thing but you'll suffer for 4-6 ,days at some point. 

I am getting paid for bloodwork for a clinical study they'll kick me out of today.  $75 for full screen I just gave them real pee because markers in my blood will raise questions that will DQ me.  So I gave them real pee as well and am interested to see how everything is.   I got a lot of hate on my last post thinking I was reducing people's suffering and my benzon use but I'm trying to give hope to people you can get off.   It really wasn't that bad considering it's been a few weeks and I am back to trying to taper kratom but more tackle life without the side effects these GABAb drugs are causing.   Benzos aren't fun either but this was a new experience for me and I really do think you can reduce the time line.   I might update if my liver and kidney are good but might just leave the sub now.

Tldr: went straight to high doses of baclofen after 2 years 2-8g use binging at the end and affecting me.  Now 2 or 3 weeks off phenibut and a small once daily dose of baclofen.  It's possible good luck.",9

I started this slow taper back May-June and I was only dropping my dose 10mg at a time so I could try to avoid any rebound, etc. It was slow and tiresome but it worked. There was only one time I had this strange detachment but that was because of my error in dosing. I got back on track and had no more rebound. 

I officially jumped once I got to 300mg and it's been 3 days with no anxiety, nervousness, etc. The true test will be in the next couple days but I think I'll be fine. I take some supplements to help me cope too. I take Memantine (which is awesome btw, blocks NMDA Glutamate and has mild Dopamine agonist properties), Vitamin B6 (helps restore GABA levels) Beta Alanine (works somehow for anxiety), Taurine (helps with GABA levels, Glutamate surges, also helps with sleep) and Magnesium (I take the Glycinate version and it really helps me to sleep all night). 

I feel really good to get rid of this monster and ill jump back to let you all know how I'm doing in a couple days. 

Have a great day and I hope everyone else defeats this beast too. You can do it, try the slow taper and try getting some helpers too. You got this !!!üëç",16

2021-11-08 16:55:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/qpo9os/my_relatively_easy_experience_getting_off/,My Relatively Easy Experience Getting Off Phenibut HCL,"This was several years ago, but for some people worried about getting off phenibut for the first time, it might not be as bad as you think. I started taking phenibut to help me sleep, my dad recommended it to me. I thought it was completely harmless, and what I didn‚Äôt expect was the next day I was extremely social and happy and I had no idea why. Eventually after doing some more research I realized it was the phenibut and it just has a super long half life.

Anyways, with me and my addictive personality I started taking 1.5-2g a day, still not completely aware of its addictive potential. But I noticed after a few weeks of taking it I would get extremely anxious if I didn‚Äôt have it that day or didn‚Äôt take enough. So instead of just stopping there I started taking more. I eventually got up to about 4g. This went on for months. Eventually, a lot of the positive effects went away. I would mostly just be very sedated throughout the day and it would help with my anxiety, but no more euphoria. 

I can‚Äôt remember exactly how long I was on it before I decided I wanted to get off it, but if I had to guess it was probably about 8-10 months of taking that 4g. It just didn‚Äôt have enough positive effects for me and I was tired of struggling to stay awake in the middle of the day. I tapered it, and once again I can‚Äôt remember exactly how long it took. But I went from 4g to probably 250mg in the matter of a month or two and barely noticed any withdrawals from it even when I completely stopped it. I actually just felt relieved to finally be off it cuz I was tired of the side effects. 

This drug has a very long half life which is optimal for tapering, and also has very mild effects which is also optimal for tapering in my experience. So for those of you struggling, just try and do as slow a taper process as you need. But once your body gets used to very low doses again it‚Äôs pretty easy to completely stop taking in my experience.",16

You can buy all this stuff at vitamin world or whatever your local store is called or order from wherever- some of the supplements I‚Äôd suggest ND I guess. Not trying to represent anybody here. I am a drug nerd who is scientifically literate.
 Originally I was using agmatine and l- theanine during the taper and although I was grateful for them, they still left me in quite a depressed and panicky mood which made it nearly impossible to leave the house. Also I should mention that I have withdrawal multiple times off of heroin, alcohol, methamphetamine, benzos, kratom (most recently). During this time I also continue to smoke cannabis despite being acutely aware that it is contributing to anxiety at times, overall it makes the time go by easier and I‚Äôm used to it being a daily partaker. 


RESEARCH MORE INTO ALL OF THIS FOR MORE REASONS WHY IT IS EFFECTIVE:


Beta alanine:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26308452_b-alanine_elevates_dopamine_levels_in_the_rat_nucleus_accumbens_Antagonism_by_strychnine

Take it on an empty stomach for full effect. I started with 3-4g but have had no issues so far around 8gpd. When I wake up in the morning this seems to have the most immediate and promising effect. IT WILL CAUSE DOSE DEPENDENT POTENTIALLY INTENSE HARMLESS TINGLING! Be prepared and know this is a sign of it working its way into your system. 

Black seed oil:

I got this stuff with 7% thymoquinone from Solaray. Google it. Apparently it has mild opioid properties as well as something to do with mitigating the calcium channel chaos caused by phenibut. Personally I think this is where the Baclofen approach is perhaps not as comprehensive and easily sourced perhaps as my stack. 
There‚Äôs a paragraph in this study stating that it will block calcium channels as well as a horde of other benefits. Personally I‚Äôm very excited about Nigella Sativa (Black Seed Oil) as I believe it could be a remarkably helpful and crucial aid to people undergoing withdrawal symptoms from most drugs.

This study reveals plenty of great benefits in terms of comfort and making this process easier on your body in addition to the calcium channel effects.

Magnesium:

I got one with several useful friends:

glycinate- great for attenuating the glutamate storm from phenibut withdrawal.

Taurate- GABAa agonist I believe
Threonate and glycinate is best.



The following are just additions to the above which by themselves are surprisingly effective in reducing the FEAR. I sincerely hope you guys find relief as I have gone from 5gpd for 6 months to 1 gpd in just 3 days at home relatively chilling lol üòù 

(Will update this)

Kava kava tea is all I have by Yogi from supermarkets and such but you should order real kava or ND tablets.



MAJOR EDIT:

Did some research on agmatine after  mostly suffering through the past few days as I‚Äôm currently at 0.250g phenibut for the past 2 days. I‚Äôve been taking a bunch of all the stuff I mentioned above and have found it certainly relieving but not entirely effective for comfort. 
Decided stupidly to take vyvanse to combat the anhedonia and it worked but the comedown was pretty brutal despite massive amounts of a tea containing valerian, chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower, liberal amounts of l-theanine, some Ashwagandha, d,l-phenylalanine, lots of dark chocolate for phenethylamine (which btw is antagonized by phenibut!), cbd,  vitamins (including l-methylfolate), and eating clean (tuna, broccoli, low carb, high protein). Also been slowly incorporating exercise doing sets of push ups, burpees, planks, yoga, walking, cleaning, etc. 

So I was sitting here all day absolutely freezing and sweating as if I was withdrawing from heroin. I totally forgot that agmatine is an alpha 2 antagonist which means it prevents activation of the sympathetic nervous system which is  one of the mechanisms responsible for the negative effects of opioid withdrawal (which is why clonidine works so well - it blocks adrenaline!).

Took 500mg. Next five or ten minutes I removed about 6 layers of clothing I had been shivering with goosebumps even on my face. 
Furthermore!!- agmatine inhibits calcium channels and glutamate signaling overall which I‚Äôm convinced is more important to address during phenibut withdrawal than just focusing on GABAb. 
I actually laughed out loud I felt so great and my roommate noticed that it was the first real laugh she heard from me all day!

Try it broskis! Look up the research breakdown on agmatine in the  3)Neurology section on examine.com and there‚Äôs tons more good stuff to back up agmatine as effective for phenibut withdrawal and general malaise as it also is an antidepressant...and apparently it can prevent seizures (key for phenibut withdrawal)...and reduce pain perception....and best of all GLUTAMATE!

This stuff was like designed for us guys.",12

I started taking it all because I quit alcohol, I was a big alcoholic, I must say that the phenibut was a miracle to forget about alcohol, I am someone who hates sobriety, I have always been naturally anxious, I have always been a person who was demotivated, I didn't want to do anything, that's why I plunged into alcohol.

Rhe problem is, now I'm not addicted to alcohol, but to phenibut ... I can do without kratom, but not phenibut. when I stop taking phenibut for 3-4 days, it's like going back to my natural sobriety which is that of an anxious and unmotivated person .. everything I don't want, of course I have a few side effects from phenibut: 

- Body irritation, the dry touch is unbearable, for example if I touch wood or a dry sheet. 

- sweating, sweaty hands. 

- demotivated, just want to take phenibut to feel good.

 I was already like this long before taking phenibut or even alcohol, I was just looking for a way to escape the annoying sobriety, I would still say my condition is slightly worse than before. so i don't know what to do, should i stop phenibut and risk falling back into a deep depression? is it really dangerous for me to keep taking 2 grams of phenibut 5 times a week? thank you",3

Any comments would be helpful!",1

2016- Xanax , Adderall, Vicodin ended up in jail .
Decided to use phenibut to get off all the ‚Äúhard‚Äù stuff .
Which worked for a week or two then I was stuck in hell again . 

2017‚Äì roughly 5-10 grams a day  

2018 ‚Äî 4 grams a day 

2019 ‚Äî 2 grams a day 

2020- 1 gram a day 

2021- 500mg a day then eventually only did 500mg every 3 days ‚Ä¶ then every 7 days .. then every 21 days ‚Ä¶ then just stopped from there after I just forgot about it mid 2021 . The worst part of it all was having hypochondria because I thought everything was cancer because of how oddly bad I felt mentally and physically.


Now I‚Äôm stuck on 2-3 OPMS Kratom shots a day ‚Ä¶ which is equivalent to roughly 42 grams of Kratom (14grams Kratom extract per shot) . I‚Äôve heard if I‚Äôve gotten off phenibut the Kratom will be a cakewalk . 

What‚Äôs your thoughts on my next journey of trying to be clean again ?",8

And I am really, really scared, I have a hip replacement surgery coming up and I am not going to be able to do it because I go into such withdrawals. I have very unkind feelings towards the idiot who told me this drug has no withdrawals. Oh, and I am also on 150mg of methadone a day plus about 15mg morphine on occasion for the pain in my hip and knees (I can barely walk, and when I do it's on a rollator.) I can see I need to start tapering NOW. I notice that even with this huge, huge pile of dope in me, I am depressed all the time, and trying to do anything at all, even simple self care, feels like completely too much effort. I have not showered in 3 days...

The issue is I could see a dependence forming and my dosages fairly rapidly increased, I went from my first dose of a gram to doing daily 2-3 grams within the span of a week, then I tried four and I believe I did that dose twice or so. I then went back down to two again, then had two major usage days where I did about eight grams each (I know.) So all in all I nearly finished a 180 count 250mg bottle + started on a tub of powder within a half month. I tried to quit cold turkey after the two days in a row of eight grams since I realized this was a terrible idea but my sleep was fucked and the rebound anxiety was kiling me the next day so the day after I took a gram and it somehow made the rebound anxiety worse, like constant panic attack levels for the whole day. Can I get away with Cold turkey? I have just taken two grams and the plan was to taper down about 250mg a day to see if it worked since I haven't been on the drug for very long, but what scares me is the chance of worse withdrawals suddenly kicking in as it's often said that they can sneak up 72+ hours after last use.",2

I think I‚Äôm going to make a doctors appointment. I just don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôs gonna take it. I‚Äôve heard baclofen is good for tapering. But does it even work when I‚Äôm going through all these surges? Does anyone have any advice? I just want to be done with this for good.",6

I‚Äôve made some huge mistakes and disregarded all advice pertaining to safe usage. I kept increasing my daily dose unfortunately. I was taking 15G every morning when I woke up and roughly 9G throughout the day. I finally realized that I can‚Äôt keep doing this. 

I stabilized my dose to 15G..  I‚Äôm currently taking 6G in the morning and 6G before bed. I‚Äôm using agmatine an hour before each dose. I‚Äôm using kratom and medical grade THC capsules during the day. 

My question is - can I continue to drop 1.5G a week? Should I slow down at all, if not now, when? Can anyone help me come up with a plan to taper? I did have horrible anxiety/high heart rate when I first started to stabilize the dose, but I‚Äôm baseline where I‚Äôm at now. 


Any advice is appreciated, and please no judgement. I know I acted irresponsibly but I‚Äôm trying my hardest to fix it.

Thank you!",7

I decided ai wanted to quit.. last week I messed it up and did 6g two days in a row.

So far this week, i got down to 3g on monday, 2.9 tuesday, 2.6 yesterday, 2.3 today. Tomorrow I plan to just do 2, plateau for saturday and sunday at 2. Monday start at 1.8 and do a .2 reduction until friday, again plateau at 1g for friday, sat, and sunday.

Then from there, not sure. Maybe 50mg a day.

I know I will be uncomfortable. I've dealt with the withdrawal symptoms outside of withdrawals before. I've already started supplementing magnesium, and I have Kava for night time.

My only concerns is the worst of the withdrawal symptoms, like psychosis and seizures. I figure even with a rapid reduction, having some drug in my system will prevent this.

In one years time I feel like it‚Äôs been a catalyst of great positive growth in several areas of my life. Those areas are social and musical. Social. I‚Äôve always been the type of person who would avoid a lot of social settings. I‚Äôve always been a little bit uncomfortable around new people and actually making new friends. Phen has helped me come out of my shell. Im more vulnerable, am more empathetic, I listen better. It‚Äôs dulls that tiny fucking voice that‚Äôs telling myself that I‚Äôm this or I‚Äôm that. Negative self talk stuff. Phenubit dulled that voice. And that was freedom. 

I am also a guitarist/songwriter. Phenubit has been a tool to help me make the best music and songs I‚Äôve made in my life. When I perform it helps me get to that flow state and stay there. Zero stage freight.  Not an ounce of self consciousness. Totally present. 

Lately I‚Äôve been feeling like shit. I wake up tired as fuck because I wake up like fuckin clock work at 3:30am with a surge. I usually take a piss and drink water then fall back asleep after a d hour or so. I wake up not feeling refresh but like a ton of bricks. 

I‚Äôll take my first dose along with Kratom then start feeling better. Around 1pm I start feeling like shit. My good anxious and get very dizzy and off balance. 

I‚Äôll then take my next dose, feel a tiny bit better. 

Buy 6 o‚Äôclock I take a smaller dose.  Really doesn‚Äôt do much. After and hour I feel dizzy as fuck until I go to bed. 

Is this withdrawal? I‚Äôm dumbfounded and am scared that I fucked up my brain. 

Do I need to increase my dose? I really think I should taper off with some pharmaceuticals y‚Äôall talk about. 

Please advise.




As of late I‚Äôm thinking I want to get off this shit ASAP. So I wanted to get some feedback.",4

I have OCD but I am terrified that the Phenibut did something to my brain.

Phenibut does very little for me. Some anxiety relief etc. My addictive personality just makes me awful for trying new *supplements*

I tried to stop recently and holy f*ck the depression and anxiety was dreadful. I wasn't even on a high dose to actually stop from (500mg). I work a very physical job 20-30 thousand steps a day and hard labour. I honestly couldn't get through a shift during the withdrawal. I then had a holiday booked and have had to bring the phenibut with me just so i can dose daily so i don't spoil my holiday.

I just want to stop phenibut (I actually tested phenibut years ago and stopped easily no issues). I just didn't have this sort of job that i just can't slack on.

What's my options?

It‚Äôs possible.,"Hello everyone. I was a user for over a year with dosages ranging from 8-18gpd. 18gpd when I started my taper 

Phenibut started to turn on me making me super depressed and anxious no matter the dosage. I tapered over 3 months to 5 gpd and jumped completely to baclofen. 

Upon switching to baclofen I experienced extreme mood swings and depression. I mean crippling depression like all I could do was go for walks or stare at the wall in my room. This lasted honestly for about a month or two after the switch. 

Once I tapered off baclofen I experienced still really bad depression accompanied with such strong derealization, I was constantly second guessing reality, nothing felt right at all. 

I really felt so alone and trapped, everyday was literally hell I thought I would be stuck here forever and I‚Äôd never get better. I have to say that both this subreddit and my girlfriend (now ex) have saved my life. 

I know feel much better. Still definitely not back to normal but I can now for the most part get through the day and even enjoy music and talking to others. Again still not back to normal I‚Äôd say 50% there but jeeez it gets better you just gotta get through those first couple months. 

I got on phenibut after alcohol fucked up my life. I had a drinking problem and would black out and hurt the people around me. Phenibut got me to stop. I was stupid and thought that since I got over phen I could handle alcohol again. I was wrong, on Halloween I went out drinking with my gf and friends and before I knew it I was totally wasted and blacked out. Got into a huge fight and hurt the women that saved me for probably no reason at all. 

I‚Äôm back to being alone but I feel I can get over it. Just know that the demons that got you addicted to this devil of a drug will be on your shoulder for the rest of your life, always be prepared to battle that devil. Never let your guard down, please take this advice as I wouldn‚Äôt want my worse enemy to go through this. 

If you have any questions or are struggling I‚Äôd happily talk to you. I also could use some support right now so it goes both ways. 

Thanks so much to all of you here.",19
