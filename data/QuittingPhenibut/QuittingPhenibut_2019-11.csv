Used 1000mg on the next day, Saturday, and then a 500 mg pill on Monday at 330am because i couldnt go to sleep. I was thinking it was withdrawals or rebound anxiety from my 2 day in a row use? So it was Wednesday and i was around a bunch of family and was feeling lots of social anxiety, i took one last 500mg capsule to take the edge off because i could not sit there that anxious with my family. Now its Friday night and i still feel anxiety. Never taking this shit again. Xanax’s rebound anxiety wasnt even as bad as this. When do you guys think i will start to feel normal again?

2019-11-25 03:53:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/e1dcpg/was_careless/,Was careless.,"Hey guys. See all the love and support on this forum and thought maybe you could provide 2 cents.

I've been extremely careless with my phenibut dosing over the last couple months. I have experience before with tapering off via gabapentin which was a breeze, but I have an overwhelming fear that that may not be the case this time.

I started taking it again a little less than 2 months ago after being totally off it for about 3 weeks. I wasn't doing what I needed to do on a physical, mental, and spiritual basis and I ended up ordering some.

Well these 2 months I have been heroically dosing for the most part every day. I'm talking 6 to 14 grams with redosing multiple times a day. Safe to say the magic ran out. I could no longer sleep, restless legs, ears popping, manic behavior, all that good shit. Needless to say I'm strung out.

So 4 days ago I made the decision to get this under control so I could get a baseline to start tapering from. I work 6AM to 3PM so I've been taking 2.5 grams in the morning at 5AM and 2.5 grams in the evening at 5 PM. Now my symptoms are fine during the day and evening, I feel great even, but its night that is the problem and that is really eating me up. 

I need to be asleep around 9PM since I work so early and these past 4 nights I've been waking up around 1AM and can't fall back asleep. I figured it would take my body a few days to catch up and that I would start sleeping through the night with a stable dosing regimen but tonight I woke up at 1 again and I'm freaking out.

Do you think I should delay my evening dose more towards 7 or 8 PM and hope that gets me through the night? Or just endure a couple more days of this and my body should catch up?

Sorry about the wall, I'm just a loss here big time and its scaring me. I have a lot of background with phenibut unfortunately but this latest run is doing me in with severe lack of sleep I've endured.

So, 2g total in 2 doses in the same day.

I felt the effects like 5 hours later, pretty strong.

Yesterday I felt a little off and weird, maybe afterglow effect.

Today I feel empty and pretty depressed. 

Is it possible that the high-ish dose is causing this?

I also started taking Finasteride yesterday (which is known to cause potential depression issues), so to determine which drug is causing this I wanted to see if any of you guys know if a single day of use can cause withdrawals?

If not, then I'll assume it's the Finasteride.

I know everyone is different but when do you think it would be safe to drop again or am I already in for a world of hurt for tomorrow? I take gabapentin normally but have not been taking my full amount in prep for the taper. I have taken 800 mg a day for the past 4 days.

I have a long history of alcohol abuse which is how I got myself here in the first place.

I’m wondering if those with histories of GABA abuse take longer to feel the withdrawal and I know my receptors are completely saturated.

fast forward a month and a half later amd i have slowly and carefully dropped from 1.5 grams a day to just 1 gram a day. i also take kratom and smoke (or eat) marijuana on a daily basis. after trying some norcos last week (former opioid addict here) i realized kratom is kind of crappy with my current tolerance. i obtained 2 8mg suboxone stripa for recreational use, however i have been using it for tge last 2 days to ct kratom. the wds were pretty brutal before i cut a tiny sliver of the suboxone sheet. i proceeded ti get stupid high (as high as methadone made me without making me feel like i was gonna die) and noticed some very slight respiritory depression.

SO SUPRISED!,"So I have a long history of phenibut use. I've detoxed from it probably around 5 times over the past decade. From cold turkeying a 15g/day habit to slowly tapering a 3g habit I've had a lot of experience with phenibut withdrawal. For whatever reason, I often find myself returning to phenibut.

I don't have access to any scheduled medications so I've always had to find random, obscure methods of coming off of phenibut if I didn't want to just slowly taper or cold turkey. This go round I've been on for about 5 months, with the last 2 months being on 6g + daily. 

I'm 4 days into my withdrawal and this is what I'm currently using:

Etifoxine -- 50 mg three times daily

Tofisopam -- 100 mg three times daily

Apigenin -- 200 mg three times daily (like drinking a whole box of chamomile tea in one shot)

Valerian -- (440 mg extract of .8% rosavins along with 1.6g of root... so 4 caps) three times daily

Phenibut -- 1g at bedtime 

The withdrawal is close to nothing. This is AMAZING. I have had some TERRIFYING experiences coming off of phenibut, some of which were even close to benzo withdrawal. However, this is so mild. My anxiety is a definitely a bit higher than normal. I'm sweating just a tiny bit more at night. Falling asleep has been a bit harder even with doxylamine 25 mg that I get over the counter. 

Before anyone comments that tofisopam is a benzo it's a 2,3-benzo and doesn't even bind to the BZD receptor, its action is mainly on PDE. Tofisopam and etifoxine both have close to no dependence liability and are not scheduled meds in the US.

I’m on day 5 of a cold turkey quit. Yesterday was probably the toughest day so far but it wasn’t that bad. I have somehow slept 7 or more hours every single night. The most annoying symptoms I have are obviously anxiety, a weird brain Zappy feeling in my head, and constant itching! I found out that quitting phenibut can cause a histamine release or something like that so my whole body won’t stop itching. Overall this has been the easiest withdrawal, but I know that has to be because I was only using daily for 8 days and prior to that I was using 2-3 times a week. Would you say if at the beginning of day 5 I am in a manageable state, that I’m in the clear? I’m feeling pretty lucky right now. I was having a way worse time when I binged out on phenibut- 5.2 grams a day for 8 days. The drug itself was having a paradoxical reaction and it was making my anxiety and insomnia horrible. I’m so grateful I made this step. I have issues with substance abuse I’ll be the first to admit. When someone has to put themselves through this phenibut withdrawal 3 times- that means the person is the problem, and I can fully admit that. I will never be able to take phenibut recreationally.

Iv'e been using phenibut pretty frequently for the past month but its been a bit sporadic. Sometimes 3 or 4 days in a row, then like 5 days off. These last two weeks has been more like every second day but my doses have been pretty small. Usually ranging from 500mgs to 1 gram. (still very stupid I know) Anyways I decided that I'm going to take a bit of a break so it's been about 56 hours since my last 850mg dose. The thing is, I feel totally fine, I actually feel pretty good today, am I in for an ass kicking soon? I know there can be a delay with withdraws but I feel like I should still experience some discomfort leading up to it. I have trouble believing that I would go from feeling good to absolute hell out of nowhere. I could be wrong though.",2,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4308455}"

Okay. So I’ve been using for 4 weeks.. literally I haven’t slept in my bed except once these last 2 weeks... as my use escalated.. 
So I started the first 2 weeks using the actual Phenibut tabs from Russia and I knew I was using 2.5g-4g a day... with the exception of the first weekend. I ran out until I had more shipment come through... I was off 2 days and horrible withdrawals, couldn’t see straight to save my life, numb... like no emotion at all... then my order came through... I had school.. took some.. side effects, gone...

So week 2 I used around the same amount, slightly escalating, but not much... took a sleep break on the weekend, then back to it for the week..,

Keep in mind the reason I did this during the week and stayed up and then took the weekend off was because I have classes and homework all week. And so I would try to basically stay up all night and for some reason this made a very very simple like almost I was on like Adderall but better almost like it was like the bus exit see you up over by nine and also like I was relaxed at the same time. I don’t know how to explain it but there’s other things I would have been better besides the point and I won’t go into as far as nodding out in weird places like standing up and when I fall into things like into a wall or into the corner of my sink in with my head just out of nowhere and things of that nature but yeah. And I would also pass out sometimes for like two hours or four hours just like kneeling down where I put my head down and I fall sleep so I didn’t stay out for the entire five days a week I would fall asleep sometimes towards the last three or four days for like two hours or five hours.

Then the last 2 weeks.. it escalated from buying the pill form to buying that much cheaper powder form from the US. And then I didn’t realize just grabbing a tablespoon scoop that I was using 10 g at once instead of 3 g. And after weighing it I was like oh my gosh I’m using way way too much. And so slowing it down about half that we threw down ending it with taking about 30 g a day to about 20 g a day for the third week

Finally the fourth week I was up to about 28 to 30 g a day and has lasted until about Wednesday so half the week through then I realized my body just couldn’t take it I wasn’t able to stay up and I wasn’t even feeling the euphoria or low stimulation from here anymore. Like I tried taking 10 g and hour later taking 5 g in an hour later taking 10 g and if I wasn’t going to be feeling euphoric from that, like I wasn’t going to feel euphoric from anything.

Deciding after this and declining test scores and schooling I knew it was time to start. So starting this weekend I stopped for two days basically slept there and now I’m starting a tapering schedule.  

So given that I was on it for four weeks, a few people have said that they’ve been on it for years and a few people have said that since it was a high dosage though, that I could maybe cut in half right away and then after that I could start cutting it down maybe half a gram to a quarter gram a day until I’m off or almost off.. then even less.. maybe from .5g  down to .250g a day until off.., 
Does that sound reasonable or what would be in anybody’s opinion a good tapering schedule.?

So I would say my leveled off max dose of the last week was probably 25 to 30 g a day..",1,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.55264795}"

E.g. in August my moderate dose per day was 3-4g of phenibut, 1200-2000mg gabapentin and 50-100mg of baclofen, because only phenibut does nothing special for me even at high doses, just drug, which stabilizes my emotions and makes me a bit sociable...

Hello all, it's been a week since I took my last dose of phenibut. I tapered super fast the last few days, going from 3GPD -> 250mg and jumped. 


The first three days were hell. Fatigue, anxiety, delusions, mood swings, feelings of dread. I couldn't go outside for those first three days. I was reading every single quittingphenibut forum and posts to feel less alone, and to see if anyone else shared my symptoms.


Symptoms quickly dropped after that. I still get some anxiety in the morning and at night, but I had anxiety even before starting phenibut so it's hard to tell what's baseline and what's not.


I still have trouble sleeping. Anxiety is worse at night and when I wake up. It still comes in waves. I wake up like 3 times a night with anxiety. I play netflix in the background to help me fall asleep. Really helps.


I smoked weed at night in order to fall asleep, along with melatonin every night. I would caution smoking weed because it did kind of increase paranoia, but it helped me become sleepy. 


Overall, it gets better day by day. I used a bit of kratom at the end of my binge, but would not recommend going over 10g a day or using it more than 2 weeks. 


DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL to the point you're drunk. Maybe a beer or two at night to help you relax at the worst of it. I have gotten drunk maybe three times during this experience, and the next days were incredibly worse, with panic, anxiety, dysphoria and depression to the max. The nights where I didn't drink, the next days were so much better.

I had been taking phenibut around 6 months, 3 grams per day at highest. Got accidentally hooked on it as it was included in a sleep supplement and the first time I tried to taper 50mg per day from 2.5 grams was a disaster. I had unmanageable withdrawals ten days in, which appeared suddenly after a pretty painless taper otherwise. It took about a week for the complete anhedonia and other acute symptoms to life even with taking more phenibut. Spent most of the summer at 3 grams and didn’t feel myself for two months or so. In that time I ordered baclofen and gabapentin and took my time researching how to use them. 

I am also dependent on kratom, which I’ve been taking for 8 years daily-haven’t changed my dose in 5, and am a lifelong caffeine addict. I have no intention of quitting either though I do want to cut my usage back. I also started drinking kava every night before bed because in withdrawals and for weeks after I had such terrible nightmares and sleep paralysis I couldn’t fall asleep.

I am a very active person and have a physical job and physical hobbies. I eat healthy which was necessary since I take kratom anyway. Lots of produce and hardly any junk food. I drink alcohol occasionally, maybe 2-3 drinks one month and none the next. I have been abstaining lately so as not to mess with my taper. I believe diet, exercise and hydration helped out a lot.

Some people recommended swapping my 3 grams a day all at once with baclofen while others said they did it gradually. I went with replacing 500 mg of phenibut with 5 mg of baclofen at a time and it was almost totally painless. I chose this path because I saw a couple of physician assisted schedules that went the same way and I wasn’t sure if replacing all at once was any different from CT. I had maybe two days of moderate anxiety and took an extra 5 mg those times but otherwise a lot of the symptoms I felt could be explained away as exhaustion, PMS, etc. I was pretty worried that I was going to have to deal with anhedonia or at least crippling depression after switching over since I’ve read that others had that experience but mostly I was just irritable. Stayed at 30mg for a week and now I’m dropping 5 mg of baclofen every couple of days. The first day or two I get tired quickly and my 2 mile walk home I feel like I’m dragging a tire behind me, but I’m able to function and mentally feel pretty good. Now I’m at 15 mg per day and should be done soon. 

I’ve had some people ask me privately why I chose baclofen instead of just tapering and I see that question asked a lot on here: isn’t it just switching one addiction for another? For me I can say the reasons that drove me were:

1. Time: once I got “stable” I tried to taper again and could manage 50 mg every three days, but even then I would feel somewhat shitty and not myself most of the time. That made it a 6 Month process, at least and that’s assuming I didn’t have to slow down as I got lower.
Which directly leads to-

2. Money: it was cheaper for me to buy expensive Indian meds then to buy tub after tub of phenibut for a taper.

I am happy to be done and have no desire to take it again. Personally I never experienced any high so I’m not even tempted. I am nervous about what I’ll feel like when I’m off of baclofen but staying on that is not an option for me. I am motivated to be done with this and looking forward to healing.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.53639495}"

2019-11-07 23:03:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/dt9ulq/28_days_later_a_retrospective/,28 days later; a retrospective,"I posted here about a month ago talking about how I would be cold turkeying from a month of daily 5-7 gram usage (not by choice). Looking back, I’m very blessed to have had such minimal withdrawal and such an auspicious recovery. 

That first weekend off of it was an awkward, jumpy hell, I just wanted to sleep and shut out the world, but instead I went to a football game, a soccer game, and a war reenactment. There was a profound sense of dysphoria and rushing, like I was always in a hurry to get through my next social function so I could get out of sight and back to bed. The experience was comparable to being on the edge of losing your composure on an acid trip in public. I felt like I was barely holding it together and was going to jump out of my skin, and yet at the same time knew I was in no real danger of running off screaming. I was too paralyzed in my own psyche to make a scene over how anxious I was. Pharmacologically speaking, I was going through half a gram of theanine and half a milligram of clonidine every day. 

The next week was surprisingly tolerable at first, but actually got worse as the week went on. The first half of the week, I made it through work alright, albeit whilst battling constant negative self talk and feelings of inadequacy, and slept my afternoons away afterwards. By the end of the week I started using an absurd amount of kava-kava to try to wean myself down to lower doses of clonidine and improve my sense of well-being simultaneously, but instead of having any pro social or euphoric effects it made me profoundly depressed. I was either asleep, near sleep, or felt like shit. Probably because the kava made me more comfortable doing nothing, so I got nothing accomplished and felt shitty. The anxiety was no longer acute anxiety so much as generalized anxiety, spurred on by the fact that my job was coming to a close for the season and I needed to find new work. 

That weekend and the start of the next week was hellish. I was mostly just super depressed and toying with the idea of relapsing on alcohol or cough syrup; the alcohol I’m 6 months clean from and the cough syrup I haven’t abused in years. On Thursday though, this evil fog of depression and misery started to clear up and I got some positive momentum. It honestly didn’t occur to me that the shittiness at the start of the week may have been prolonged withdrawals. 

On that Sunday I went to an NFL game and had a great time. No noticeable difficulties with withdrawal or mood in general, just a little post-game blues because the excitement was over. Tense game, too. Over the course of the next week I managed to turn my funk around, applied to some 50 jobs, kept my head up, and two weeks out from that I’m glad to say I have two jobs now at cool companies that I start this Sunday, and those are actually just backups if I don’t hear back from a $50,000 a year position that I think I interviewed for pretty damn well even though I had no experience in the field. 

For those of you just getting started, my warning and encouragement to you is that my experience was both easier and more surreptitious than I thought. The worst of the withdrawal was definitely the first three days, but after that it came in waves. After all of this, I can’t say conclusively that I’ll never use phenibut again, but I can say with certainty that I’ll never use it with regularity again, especially not daily.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.53850776}"

started on four grams a day ending up on 16 a day. Googled my ass of before i started but of course only read the good parts. Here is my situation right now. I take 3,5 gram every morning at 6 when I wake up feeling I´m dying. All day long I sitting in my underwear unable to eat or take care of me or my home. I only go out when I really must. I tried quitting tapering for two years but my brain seems to be damaged for life. I went four months in the summer 2018 down to 0,65g and relapsed after a total collapse.

I been hospitalized 20+ times for manic paranoid psychosis and right now I´m on high doses of lithium, but I don´t feel it helps.

Before my phenibut use I was a happy dude with a job and girlfriend. That´s all gone now. I think about killing myself many hours of the day. But still there is a little bit of hope in me that all this will pass.

I started using phenibut as a less harmful way to sleep, I´m on highest legal dose of zopiclone and Seroquel to make them kick harder. First two years I slept like a baby on phenibut. All is left now is the manic thing.. mixed with anxiety, crazy high blood pressure and a total personality change.

The psychical effects is shivers and a very cold body, freezing my ass of. Ten minutes after a 10 gram intake I get warm as usual.

At the start of my use, I had it under control 1g every 2 to 3 days then 2g maybe once a week; then it went downhill and quick. After just around three weeks I took my first 6g dose and didn't go back from there, every day I'd take a small dose in the morning then 6gs at night. Once that habit had started, I quickly moved on to take up to 20g's at parties as well as drinking. I think out of everything that I experienced well on it the thing that stands out the most now is the incredibly high sex drive it gave me, everything could be about sex someone asked me to go with them somewhere they wanted to have sex, someone talked to me and said something that at the time sounded off it had something to do with them wanting to have sex; you get the idea.

I didn't quit because I know I had a problem I quit after running out and wasn't able to buy more. The first day I had no issues, but the next is when the delusions and severe agitation started I'd go as far as to say I had psychosis. At the time I was living at home and started thinking my family was out to get me, so I packed my things and walked out, but I didn't get far before working out this wasn't right and something was really wrong. After getting home, I ended up talking to a mate on text chat, I said a lot of things that I wish I never did but at the time they all seemed real to me. 

One thing that stands out to me about other peoples accounts is that they seem to have a lot of problems with sleep, but for me it was the other way around that night at around 2 am I got to sleep and didn't get back out of bed for the next 38hours of on and off sleep, about 10 hours at a time with a few hours in between. At this point, I was still lethargic but no longer crazy. 

When I started my use, I only know you could get hooked on the stuff not that the withdrawals were anything other than maybe a bad hangover, but now I wish I had never run into the shit. 
As I said it's been a year and a half and at times I still miss it, when out at parties I think if I just had a g I could get up and dance and not feel so out of place. At the end of the day, however, I'm glad I'm not still on it and can now look back at that part of my life as something I've left behind.

I was a daily user for 18 months at just under a gram per day. I used Baclofen and tapered 50mg per day for a few weeks and then tapered the Baclofen for a few more weeks and then jumped. It's just over 3 months since my last Baclofen dose. 

I still struggle with pretty intense anxiety. This manifests as pretty horrible tension in my throat and it feels like I'm being choked. The throat symptoms have started getting a little better in recent weeks, but now I'm feeling a lot more jitteriness/nervousness/fear and even waves of derealization as well as depression/anhedonia. I thought things were getting better and in some ways they are, but in some ways it is different, but still crappy. 

Despite all of this, I am a generally positive person and did not have any general anxiety issues before phenibut. I see a counselor and run every day. I do Wim Hof breathing and take cold showers. I try to stay busy and eat fairly healthy, but I still struggle with the fear of being like this forever.

I’ve been on some amount of phenibut (I take the FAA kind), for a long time, maybe four years? In the first year I went up to 2 grams a day, then down to 150mg with Baclofen, and lots of misery. Never got off completely. Then, about a year ago, I started going up again to get off kratom, which got me hooked back onto the big doses. Ended up at 4 grams a day. I started tapering and am down to 420mg. My taper has been to go down by 100 every three days until I was down to 800, then down by 50 every three days, except in the last week where I tried to go down by thirty-forty every day. Apparently I have to slow down because I stopped sleeping and my anxiety is off the charts. 

In the last year I’ve gotten off a two year kratom addiction and two benzodiazepines, (xanax and flurazepam) one I’d taken for three years and one for five years. Why was I prescribed two benzodiazepines to take every day? I was actually prescribed three to take every day, still on the third, and I don’t know why. My case was mishandled big time and if my old doctor was still working I’d attempt a complaint. I got a new doctor, but the damage was done, and getting me off the benzos had to wait till I was stable enough to get off them which wasn’t until recently. I have PTSD, general anxiety disorder and depression so I have to be careful when adding more stress. 

So, because of the recent withdrawals and my anxiety/depression, this taper has been rough, but I’d been proud of how it had been going. I don’t want to slow down, but I need to. I want off, I’m mad at myself for ever starting this stuff in the first place, for going back up after I went through so much misery to go down, for needing more time, for whining about this.

Anyhoo

After being on it for the first year I decided I needed to lose some weight and started running. 

I have developed an eating disorder, where I only eat large large quantities of food at night and it seems like it doesn’t absorb because (TMI)I just have very large loose stools 8hrs later.

Recently my wife confronted me asking what I was on? I haven’t been acting differently besides my normal depressed anxious self that I have become by staying on the same exact dose for three 3yrs.

But now to the point. She told me I looked like a meth head.

When quitting or during, do the sunken in eyes go away, does your skin get less wrinkly? Granted the could all be do to the fact I’m always dehydrated from the phenibut, eating habits and the fact I chain smoke reading stories about how horrible it is to quit phenibut.
