I am on day 4 and have noticed a little heightened anxiety and mood swings. Nothing too horrible yet. Anyone use alternative supplements to help with this that are less dependent?

List of progress below, will include any supplements/drugs I take to counter the WD on each respective day. Besides that it is cold turkey. 

Day 1: Nothing besides craving

Day 2: nothing, was physically active all day and distracted

Day 3: uncomfortable kind of like foggy brain

Day 4, Morning: less brain fog but heightened irritability and anxiety

Day 4, Night: mood is null, no happiness or sadness. Having light chills. Twitching*

Day 5, Morning: Mood is still in a place of emotionless. No excitement or sadness. Minor chills still.

Day 5, Evening: very lethargic, tired, emotionless. 

Day 6, Morning: Kind of nauseous could be coincidence. Still feel pretty emotionless.

Day 6, Evening: felt very tired went to bed at 6:00 P.M. woke up at 8:00 A.M. the next morning.

Day 7, Morning: mood swings noticeable, becoming very agitated easily. 

Day 7, Evening: Drank about 3oz of liquor to calm myself down. After the drink I feel much more normal.

Day 8, Morning: Woke up with a headache, I have a bad alcohol sensitivity.

Day 8, Mid Day: sadness has set in, increased anxiety.",5

I had been using kratom off and on for a bit. Usually would only use once or twice a week, but then I noticed I had started taking it daily or almost daily and wanted to stop. I decided to use phenibut (I have used plenty of times before) to help mitigate any potential withdrawal. But now I’m a little past one week of taking phenibut daily (1.5-3g) and I’m worried I’ll have withdrawal coming off this. How long does it take (I.e. how many days in a row) before you feel withdrawal from phenibut? Some posts I’m reading as early as two weeks. Also, should I fast taper off of the phenibut and will that help with withdrawal symptoms? Or am I better just stopping completely now and ripping off the bandaid? Also, I’m starting to suspect that I wasn’t as addicted to the kratom as I worried. I would crave it when I stopped but I didn’t have any sort of physical withdrawals (I had taken it daily for 2 weeks straight). So I might have fucked myself by taking something even more addictive lol. Thanks in advance.",3

But just a word of caution I'm sure many here are aware of. I had a bad week and between zopiclone relapses, losing my girlfriend etc I decided to order some tianeptine to stretch out a bunch of the suboxone pills that were lost in all of the chaos. I have a little pile of powder I have been trying to stretch for weeks. I got that bullshit sodium and it was as   disgusting and sticky as I remember and after a while just completely shredding my mouth. The euphoria chase was only about 3 days and some in the end I was just taking grams and grams of powder trying to catch a nod like a junkie piece of shit. Coming from a lifelong heroin/opioid addict Tia is unsustainable. Too short acting etc. After torching through the 20 grams. My job thinks I'm totally losing it. So yesterday early am was my last dose. And then right before I went to work at 4 I microdose some suboxone powder just to reintroduce a tiny bit into my system. Well  By the end of my shift at 10pm I was yawning, eyes watering, pupils dialating, and starting to need to shit. I thought I would be golden. Took about an 8mg suboxone and in about 10 minutes it felt like the moon overhead was laughing in my face and god and the universe just noticed me in the worst of ways. It was like my heroin days of taking it too soon. But it made no sense because I was most definitely in withdrawal from my Early AM dose of tianeptine. Stumbled down the street from my mom's house and it was like I was in a movie, every house looked the same the moon stayed in the same place in the sky and I legit thought I was just stumbling in place. Very surreal. I was just so desperate to get home and collapse. I couldn't stop spitting yawing, crying, all of it. I did get home and went straight to the bathroom grabbing 2 zopiclone sleeping pills along the way and stripping and stepping into a hot shower in one swoop. I must have immediately passed out. I also hadn't been sleeping due to tianeptine been such a shitty chase. So I guess the PW and everything hit me at once. I probably didn't need the zop. I woke like 4/5 hours later to cold water running on my with my foot so fucking cramped all I could do was cry. I'd been in this fetal position with the shower running on me the whole time. Now that it was so cold I was so confused and thought god was punishing me had to break this cramp and get out cause my mom and friends and family were waiting on me. In reality I stumbled out freezing to a cold empty addiction riddled home. Wait as long as possible to take suboxone if on Tia, it has some strange legs/binding affinity thing going on. If I would have just dosed like 1 mg every 4 hours It wouldn't have been as severe I'm sure.  Still have chills today and I looked like a lizard last night and today. Pupils hugely dilated but all wonky and uneven like a snake. The demons of addiction demand my pain and suffering for their pleasure so this type of thing is not unusual for me.",7

2021-06-23 08:55:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/o6c8xo/tapering_sleepwalkers/,Tapering Sleepwalkers,"Hey, everyone. So I am currently in the middle of attempting to CT my sleepwalker shot/capsule use and it’s not going so hot. I’m wondering if anyone here has any advice on how to proceed with a taper using sleepwalkers - I’d assume capsules - as opposed to ordering bulk phenibut online.

I had previously gone through massive withdrawals in a 80/20 CT/taper off of a  HCl habit that lasted approx 5 months 2 years ago wherein all dosing procedures were completely thrown out the window. A few months ago I started going back to the smoke shop where I used to get the bulk powder pheni (which they no longer carry) and began taking capsules and shots but in conservative, albeit sporadic doses on weekends only. Within the last month, however, with the nice weather and yearning for activity/productivity, I started taking more throughout the week and since having taken my last 2 shots Sunday (6/20) I am now (6/23) experience withdrawals and insomnia most of you know is very uncomfortable. I wouldn’t say it as pronounced as my 2-yrs-ago habit but uncomfortable nonetheless.

The issue is that I have a tendency to dose in a whim, and really dose for how intense I want the day to be. The most I took in one day was 5 shots and perhaps the next day took 2.

I would really like to know what you think of a tapering regimen at my current state using capsules. I don’t want to buy bulk powder, 1.) I don’t ever want to look at one of those containers again, and 2.) shipping would take longer than I am willing to wait. For a basic reference point this past weekend I took and average of 2-3 shots/day Friday through Sunday. Do you believe taking a capsule or two could at least help me sleep? My thought would be I taper according to the level of insomnia as that is the main issue here. Not the phallic demons I saw, explosions I heard, and red lights that began to glow as the withdrawals set during my 2-yrs-ago experience.

What the heck is going on? I have been posting here a lot lately because these past four weeks have been hell on Earth for me. I am finally checking in with some doctors and looking to get serious medical help because at this point I am desperate.

I used Phenibut for six weeks almost daily, in doses ranging from 250mg-1750mg. I was probably averaging around 750mg a day. The drug turned on me and I was forced to do a rapid taper of over the course of a week. It has been 26 days since I had any Phenibut.

Since then, I have had very little relief from the onslaught of symptoms. Anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, sever depression, etc. A few days ago things started to get worse as I started getting horrible physical symptoms. I was using benzos (first Ativan, then Klonopin) for the span of 26 days. Took a lot in the beginning and then steadily weaned off. Only took a couple during the past week. This is day two of being off completely after my last dose of 0.125mg. I have also been taking Gabapentin and that has not helped so now I have been tapering THAT as well. That could also potentially be causing my issues.

I just don't know what the hell to do at this point. Anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, severe depression, dissociation, physical pain, pins n needles, nausea. Yesterday I was borderline manic and had to take seroquel to knock me out at night after getting five hours of sleep the day before. That morning I was so ill with anxiety I almost vomited when I woke up, something that has NEVER happened to me before. 

I didn't even start getting these physical symptoms until a couple of days ago. I am stuck with my parents in the meantime and they are trying to set me up with some doctors/medical facilities but I feel hopeless at this point. I am almost convinced I will spend the rest of my life like this. I am so angry with myself forever touching Phenibut. My Gaba system is just completely f$cked at this point.

I am terrified of going to the hospital and just having them put me on more benzos. I am terrified of them putting me on benzos and then that STILL not working. I am terrified of being off all of these Gabaergics (which I want more than anything) and then still feeling this way three months from now. This is just awful and I am terrified because most medical facilities don't even know how to deal with benzo withdrawal, let alone Phenibut.

Right now I would give every penny in my bank account to go back to before I ever touched Phenibut. I wish someone could just put me in a coma for six months and wake me up when this is over (if it ever will be.)

The only good news is that I think what is causing this new bout of anxiety/symptoms are the benzos leaving my system and lowering the Gabapentin. I will be going back up on the Gabapentin, even though I hate taking it and it does not help, and then lowering again soon.

\*Edit: I've been taking Prozac and speed (Adderall/Vyvanse) for years as well and stopped both of those earlier this year. Prozac two months ago, was forced to cold turkey the Vyvanse at the beginning of this month. I am so amped up now anyways if I was to take Vyvanse I feel I would go insane.",7

Now I’m here needing help again and I appreciate all the kind words. This time is worse with me coming off somewhat of a higher dose because I’m on 10-11 grams 3-4 days a week. When I came off 5.5 grams a day I had lyrica and gabapentin to use the whole time and I was prescribed them so I didn’t have to worry about tapering off those. This time I have nothing. So I have found a residential rehab to go to locally that I know is a good place but they said their detox can’t help me and I need to go to a hospital. I’ve been bounced around and trying to get the help I need is hard. I have explained in previous posts that tapering isn’t an option for me, unfortunately for multiple reasons. The only option for me is cold turkey quitting high dose Kratom and this at the same time. I’m kinda just getting bounced around and of course nobody knows what Phenibut is. For those of you that had to go to the er did you wait until you were in full blown withdrawal to go in? People are saying I can detox at an inpatient psych unit but I’m just really needing to go somewhere that can keep me alive and safe and preferably out of psychosis. I already know I’m gonna be in hell and I’m not expecting to be comfy. I used to shoot 2.5-3 grams of heroin and swallow 10 bars of Xanax in a day so no amount of benzos they can give me will calm me down. If I do get them to put me on baclofen in the hospital then I’m gonna have something I have to taper off of afterwards which I would prefer not to but I might not have a choice. I have a loving and supporting family and boyfriend. I got honest with my therapist and my AA sponsor. I have a lot of support but nobody has any comforting answer for me. I can’t get a hold of my psychiatrist. I can’t keep doing this to myself. Anyone in here struggling, we can’t keep doing this to ourselves. We are all strong as fuck to go through what we are going through. It’s incredibly scary when doctors don’t understand the substance you are coming off of and when it’s very hard to get help. I’m so grateful for this subreddit, you guys helped me on my other two quits and I was able to come here and help other people once I made it through. I’m slightly ashamed to be in here struggling again and in a worse spot than before, but I know you guys won’t judge me.",2

So I used Phenibut for about six weeks in mild/medium dosages. I stopped after doing a rapid taper of one week three weeks ago. Today is day 22 of being clean and things are not that much better. I should mention too I had to cold turkey my Vyvanse prescription right after getting off the Phenibut since my psychiatrist cancelled it.

I am starting to wonder though if the reason I am feeling like crap so much even has to do with the Phenibut. I have been taking Klonopin and Gabapentin to deal with the horrid anxiety I have had since then. I had successfully tapered off the Klonopin three days ago but today, this morning, I felt such overwhelmingly petrifying anxiety at around 1:00 that I cracked and took 0.250mg. It killed the anxiety I had but lead to an insane depressive episode this afternoon where I burst out crying, thinking my life is over and I will be dead soon. This was odd considering that, why Klonopin has depressed me in the pasty, it never made me feel like that.

The Gabapentin doesn't seem to be helping or even doing much so I plan on getting off that. I hate the lethargic, dizzy, foggy-headed feeling it gives me, and it seems to worsen the depression. I swear, sometimes it even seems to make the anxiety/symptoms worse (although to be fair it usually does calm the anxiety to an extent.)

I just don't even know anymore. Is it still the Phenibut or do you guys most likely think it is the Klonopin/Gabapentin? I plan on getting off both of these since I don't want to be taking them but it is hard. I would be in a detox right now but I am stuck living with my parents and won't let me.

Any thoughts or advice? I would love to hear your guys' thoughts on what is going on because I am very confused. Is this Phenibut PAWS? The Klonopin causing this? The Gabapentin? CTing the Vyvanse? Everything? I should also mention too I stopped taking SSRIs (Prozac) two months ago. I am freaking juggling five different drugs here trying to figure out which is causing which and what is going on.

Sorry to be posting here so much but I am a complete wreck mentally and you guys are helping. I literally feel like I am going insane. These past three weeks I have done nothing but go on the Internet, listen to music, go for walks, and sometimes (when I am able) hangout with friends.

Because right now I seem unable to cut down even slightly.

So what do you guys think? Should give Phenibut a rest for a week or so with the help of baclofen?

Or just save them for later.

It felt SO good leaving those calcium channels alone for a day. This is kind of interesting. I´m low on calcium, so take calcium tabs that my doc gave to me. And Phenibut works on calcium channels.",3

I've gotten myself into a real pickle. Over the last several years I have become dependent on phenibut at 5 grams per day, kratom at 30 gpd, Gabapentin rx from doctor at 2400 mgpd, and Zolpidem (ambien er 12.5 mg) rx from doctor. Multiple times over the course of these addictions my body seems to short circuit and one or more of the drugs suddenly stops working but because of the combination I'm not even sure exactly what is happening. When it happens I suddenly experience extreme insomnia, cold sweats, agitation, severe depression, racing thoughts, the typical symptoms as discussed on the quittingKratom and quittingphenibut subreddits. I am done with it all and just want my life back but it seems truly impossible. Cutting even just one gram of the phenibut out throws everything into overdrive. I recently switched strains of Kratom and that may also have exacerbated the situation. I just feel so helpless. The insomnia has cropped up from time to time over the years when this happens and it is the worst of all symptoms for me. I am lucky to get 3 hours of sleep at night if I can get to sleep at all. This will go on for a week or more before setting out. I am married with children and a stable job and am the primary breadwinner so that makes it impossible for me to do any kind of Inpatient Rehab. I am lucky in that my wife knows and I have her support, she will soon be taking over the Kratom dosing for me. I take it as capsules which I make up in a press so I will be making them and giving them to her and she will be dispensing them for me so that l can begin to taper off Kratom. My plan is to come off one at a time, Kratom first because I believe it will be easiest, then phenibut. Once those are gone, then Gabapentin is next, and last, someday, the Zolpidem. Thoughts on this process? I respect to this community and its people immensely and I look forward to hearing your comments. Thank you for taking the time.",8

Since switching from capsules to powder, and with a serious T1 spinal injury/severely partially torn gluteus medius tendon (playing the waiting game with doctors, can't seem to get pain management to take me seriously, but looking around as it's better than doing dope to get through the agonies of phenibut/waiting for full evaluation results pre-surgery) has seemed extremely caustic even parachuting (no empty capsules handy).

I'm having difficulty stabilizing my dose to figure out exactly where I'm at - I'm prescribed (long term, though) Dizepam 10mg 3x/day, Gabapentin 100mg 3-6x/day as needed, and Baclofen and have tons of extra of that sitting around, haven't been using any of them more than absolutely necessary while binging, recently.

I'm planning to CT at least temporarily, at least in order to figure out exactly what I actually *need* to take.

Today is day 20 of me being clean from Phenibut after using almost daily for six weeks (250mg-1750mg a day was my range.) I hate to say it, but I am still feeling the effects pretty badly. Horrible anxiety/panic attacks, severe depression, everything. I also had to cold turkey my Vyvanse prescription on the 3rd of this month so I am sure that is making the depression a lot worse/anhedonia worse. I am completely mentally compromised. For three weeks now the only things I have been doing are going on the Internet, listening to music and walking. I can't do anything else.

I should add too I was taking Klonopin for about two and a half weeks and I just stopped that after weaning myself off. Took my last dose of 0.125mg almost 48 hours ago. I'm also currently taking Gabapentin but that only helps so much.

Despite everything I still feel like the Phenibut is the cause for most of my symptoms and I just wanted to see if anyone here also went through Phenibut PAWS and what that was like. By day 20 I was hoping I would find some relief but nope. The only thing that truly worked were the benzos it seemed like but I know I can't keep taking those.

Any advice? I am stuck at home with my parents (embarrassing, yes) in the meantime and they won't take me to a detox/rehab/mental facility. And for those who did experience PAWS what was it like for you and when did it end?",5

At 9gpd anxiety was significantly reduced but has been replaced by pretty strong depression and mood swings. After about a month at 9gpd I decided to drop to 8.5 gpd last week. 

Now I am experiencing the worst depression I have in my life. Can’t get out of bed, everything is a burden, I feel so disconnected and just terrible. I don’t know what to do.

I was taking as high as 28gpd, used Baclofen and Gabapentin to get down to around 8gpd relatively quickly, but while waiting for more Baclofen and Gabapentin to come in the mail I stupidly found myself back at 14gpd. 

But I wasn't worried, I was sustaining after all and just waiting while tapering slowly until I could go quick again. 

Well I ended up breaking my leg in a longboarding accident, and ended up in the hospital for surgery. Things got super bad because the anesthesiologist needed to know if I'm on anything to properly administer the anesthesia for surgery. 

I told him I was on Phenibut because I was worried for the adverse effects of an anesthesia and Phenibut combo, of course he hadn't heard of it but he did some research and was able to figure out what it was closest to and go from there. 

Well due to Phenibut in my system I had taken that day (we didn't discuss dose), I woke up during surgery and ripped the breathing tube out of my throat and destroyed my voice and throat (it's healed now). 

After waking up from that surgery I got what is known as compartment syndrome on my leg where the leg just swells to an insane degree and they had to put me under for emergency surgery to cut my muscle open to relieve the swelling. After waking up from that surgery I was in full blown withdrawal. Absolutely freaking out on the nurses so they had to put me into a medically induced coma for several days. 

When coming out I was in psychosis, for about a week I didn't know where I was, couldn't speak properly, thought I was in a barn, then out at sea, then an attic somewhere, thought people were trying to kill me, making nonsensical phone calls and texts to friends and family. 

After getting out of psychosis they monitored me for a bit and I was there for 2 weeks exactly. I and they after looking into it later, knew these things were from the Phenibut withdrawal, because the way I reacted and acted they thought I was a raging alcoholic and it was due to not drinking in so long. I'm assuming they've seen similar things before in alcoholic patients who needed surgery. 

While they did administer Gabapentin, it simply wasn't enough for the dose I was on. After finally leaving the hospital with my reality in tact again, I spend the next week and a half completely numb. I couldn't feel anything and I was afraid I did permanent damage what with the stories of PAWS on here. 

The one benefit of this ordeal is I'm off Phenibut, 2 massive surgery scars and about 6 weeks later I also feel 95% back to my old self. Able to laugh and enjoy things again with small episodes of depression here and there. So PAWS didn't affect me as much as it has for some around here and I'm extremely thankful for that. I'm also thankful that despite going through the CT, I was able to do so in a hospital and not alone in my bedroom or something. 

The point of the title however is that anything can happen, you could get in a car accident or something else and be put in a position where you can no longer access your Phenibut. And if you're at a higher dose like me you may be forced to go through hell due to the uncertainty of life. 

If you're unsure about getting off, please work on doing so because this could happen to you. Everyone else who is working on it stay safe, I would have much preferred to taper down and then off than be forced to go cold turkey due to something out of my control.",41

I have to mention that on saturday i took 1g and I drank 4 beers. 

Sunday was terrible, I never had that kind of anxiety and jitter, couldn't sleep, palpitations. On Monday I went to my family doctor and told him I have anxiety (i felt sketchy to mention the phenibut, I don't think he knows anything about it and would't wanted to look like a junky and to be judged). 

The doctor gave me some suppliment for stress with bacopa monnieri, withania somnifera and nardostachys jatamansi. It helped a bit, not much, but it helped. At around 8 pm my wd reduced to almost 0. I felt so happy, but scared that it is just temporary. Somewhat it was temporary, because today, on my second day of WD, i feel fine, but once in a while I get anxious.

how much do you think this can last? I feel like I was on a small dose, the frequency was bad and also the alcohol, but should I be hopeful that maybe friday I will be somewhat not overly anxious?

I've been slow tapering since still, taking pauses sometimes due to stresses irl. I pretty much need to establish a more frequent cutting schedule aswell, and stop forgetting/procrastinating it off too from the anxiety of reducing. But I'm able to work on those.



What I haven't been able to work on is my sleep schedule, which has been causing me to ""pause"" frequently due to missing/over sleeping my first dose, and trying to re-stabilize my sleep schedule. I do drink coffee around late noon, is the only thing I can think of.. 

But I find my self sometimes staying up late, sleeping, and then sleeping, and still wanting to sleep the whole day even with sufficient sleep. I also on these days suffer from a lack of pleasure from the things I enjoy, and usually it takes coffee to spark that, and help with the excessive sleepiness.

 If it is the coffee I drink late day, it sort of sparked a vicious cycle of using that to get a kick of motivation for work. But my stupid butt, decided to make it worse and got reliant on benadryl.

I was then some where in the middle when this started a few months ago, prescribed mirtazapine, and now hydroxyzine so luckily the reliance has been taken care of from benadryl. They of course work, but still not until 12am, and they just make the lack of motivation worse the next day, with their groggy after effects. So I don't wish to use meds for sleep, anymore for this reason. And if it is caffeine causing this by throwing a wrench into my sleep cycle, it just causes me to crave caffeine more.


Any ideas on how to reclaim my sleep schedule without the help of sleep meds? I'm okay with some natural alternative suggestions such as melatonin, but that doesn't really work enough.

But with coffee being mentioned, does this sound like it's all down to the coffee? If so, does anyone else experience something similar? 

Would the simple first solution to this would to probably cut down or cut out caffeine/coffee?

Many thanks, sorry if the grammar on this is terrible, please bare while reading through it. I did take my mirtazapine last night and I'm still quite groggy.",2

I have a lot of baclofen coming in the mail soon and am thinking about making the jump as I’m not sure how much more I can taper with phenibut. How much baclofen should I take a day if I were to make the switch? In terms of anxiety, depression and anhedonia what should I expect upon making the switch?

I’m currently using the following supplements. 

Agmatine 3x 1g

I recently have quit both suboxone and phenibut at the same time. This was an unenjoyable experience. Was awake for 5 days straight. Well over 100 hours. I had to be professionally sedated to even gain a few hours of sleep.

I had been using suboxone for 7 weeks to get off opioids. I had also been abusing phenibut on and off (mostly on) for 2 years. The doses ranged from 2-5 grams.

Today is day 32 for me. I am still struggling with a low anxiety pretty much 24/7. I also struggle with falling asleep, night sweats, irritability, lack of appetite, lack of motivation, and anhedonia.

My question is for people who had been using long term and did manage to get off this shit, what has helped? Have you been taking meds that help? How long does the PAWS last? When will I feel normal again? 

To those still sick and suffering with this plague, I truly wish good things for you and hope you come out of this better people.",5

I have been a poster here for a while. Withdrawaled off phenibut twice, both times cold turkey. The first time I had a grand mal seizure of 5 g a day. I had this even with lyrica being taken daily at high doses which is an anti seizure drug and it did greatly help with the symptoms. The last time I came off it I was using about 6 grams every 3 days I think? I wasn’t always perfect with the every 3 days but no seizures as expected. I did have a harder time with anxiety and other symptoms and had gabapentin to help. I have been using secretly again for almost a year, along with Kratom. I made a very bad choice and was hiding this from my boyfriend who is in recovery from addiction and in our world this is just as bad as anything else, so we will be separating for at least 6 months to a year while I try to do this whole recovery thing again. I have to go to treatment. I can’t stay in our apartment and if I refuse to go and find somewhere else to live I won’t ever get him back and my family won’t want me in their lives either. I have to do this for me and for them. Problem is I’m currently taking 11 grams every other day. I’ll probably be forced to cold turkey with nothing because any rehab I’ve talked to says they don’t feel comfortable giving any detox meds with phenibut because they don’t know what it is. And they always assume it’s not serious. I have Medicaid so I don’t have many options. There is one place that has a detox and a rehab that I know is a good place but I doubt they will give me anything to keep me safe. I’m really scared. Should I just go to an er? This in combination with the Kratom withdrawal.. I can’t even imagine. I have withdrawn off heroin and over my 6 years being addicted to Kratom for the majority of it, I’ve learned I would take heroin withdrawal over Kratom. It lasts so much longer and it’s like a combo of opiate and benzo withdrawal. When you take high doses and take it for a long time it really is a special kinda hell. I’m scared my mind won’t make it through this and I’ll go into psychosis and have a bunch of seizures and shit. The one thing I have going for me is I use every other day but my dose is insanely high. Ugh. I’m not ready for this.",10

I was addicted to kratom for 5-6 years. As of last week, I was up to 9.8g doses 3x a day. 30 fucking grams a day. Insane. I was also using phenibut for 2 years at 9.4g a day and xanax nightly at 1mg-2ng for the past two months. 

Needless to say, I was at my limit. I constantly felt like shit and didn't know how to stop. Tapering didn't work and there was no way I was going to cold turkey everything. I looked into IOP detox programs but was turned away because my situation was ""too complex"". Eventually, an IOP program referred me to inpatient detox and I pulled the trigger.

I've never been in treatment before so I was incredibly scared of what would happen. In preparation, I printed out a few case studies, packed my bags, and checked myself into detox last Saturday. I just got out a few hours ago and I feel amazing.

Bringing case studies/literature to your evaluation is essential. Most detoxes are probably familiar with kratom by now and know how to treat it but phenibut is a little more complicated. NO ONE I talked to knew what it was. That's where the case studies came into play. I briefly explained phenibut and how it works. Thankfully, the doctor was incredibly open-minded and wrote me a prescription for baclofen based on the literature I brought. Most importantly, he started me on a Subutex/Ativan taper.

Overall, my withdrawal symptoms were incredibly mild and manageable. I had some issues with muscle tension and RLS but other than that it was a breeze. I would 100% recommend inpatient detox to anyone who feels trapped. Not everyone has the willpower to taper or quit cold turkey. Your experience will vary from location to location (I've read some horrifying detox horror stories on here), but if you're desperate for help there is a way out. 

I'm 7 days clean from kratom, phenibut, and xanax. Wishing everyone the best.",6

I used lyrica to help with the withdrawals as they were pretty intense. Now I'm coming off the lyrica and its worse then when I came off methadone and etizolam in jail. This past monday I jumped off at 800-1200mgs a day.. It's a big dose but alot of the times I would need to take about a gram for the rls to stop. I've come off gabapentin before and I figured they'd be alot alike but I was so wrong. Monday I took 300mgs in the morning and it was all I had left. By that night I was feeling pretty crappy. Rls like I've never had them anxiety and restlessness and just a sense of being extremely uncomfortable. I saw my doctor at 3 the next day. He gave me 10 ambien 10mgs for sleep and some anti diarrheal and that was it. That night I took 10mgs of ambien at about 7PM just trying to catch up on some sleep, it did NOTHING so I took another one and laid down at about 10pm and had a very hard time falling asleep. The ambien helped with the rls but I was having extreme hot and cold sweats along with intense intestinal cramps. The day after seeing my doctor I felt insanely dehydrated and I couldn't hold anything even water down (Iv had acid reflux and IBS since I was a teenager) and I have the runs really bad. So I went to the ER and I was insanely dehydrated. They gave me a regular IV bag and a potassium bag because I was very low along with a shot of adivan and zofran. I spent about 7hours there and the ER doctor sent me home with 12 150mg lyrica and my regular doctor sent out a script for ondansetron and clonidine. That was on Wednesday and it's now Saturday and I'm out of lyrica and ambien. I have some clonidine and ondansetron left. I can hold stuff down but the antdiareal just makes my IBS flare up so I'm not taking that (still have really bad runs, everything just goes right through) I know 12 150mgs prolly arent enough for a sufficient taper. I really tried to make them last but in times of pain they seem to burn more of a hole in my pocket. Clonazolam was supposed to touch down today but usps didnt come through today? Guess I'm screwed till monday. I was taking the lyrica for months on top of the tia because I ordered 100grams of raw powder and used it all in the matter of a couple months because I would have to take massive amounts in between tia shipments then finally used the rest to kick the tia but am in a really bad place because I feel like I've traded it for something much more damning.. Sounds really stupid but I should have kicked it with a few days of dope use, I was two years clean from dope and fentanyl (still three years clean from the needle) but between tia packs I would sometimes buy three or four bags of dope or fetty and would use them springinly with no problem.. besides the tia because even when I kicked the tia completely I decided not to get any dope or anything. For me it's not cravings that leave me relapsing it's the intense withdrawal effects. At this point I'm getting the clam by monday so I'm sure I'll be manageable with the clonidine and ondansetron and maybe a little weed. I scraped up like 40mgs of lyrica and have an empty zip lock bag with a little coating so I'll prolly just put some water on it.. Not gonna relapse but if anyone has any input on when I should take the little bit of lyrica? I dont want tomorrow night to be excruciating.. Do you think the clonidine will take care of the rls night sweats and anxiety? I took 300mgs last night and 150 this morning. I have some surface anxiety but feel decent  atm I know wds wont really kick in till tonight.. I know the clam will help because it's so freaking strong.. Just looking for some support I guess because I dont really have much atm.. Thanks guys, much love",9

-Ingredients: phenibut, kanna, Phenylpiracetam, Noopept, vitamin c, caffeine, Yohimbine HCL, sodium benzoate, and potassium sorbets (measurements unknown)
    I started using Kratom to kick my addiction to the Verrukt potions. I've never used just phenibut by itself. Kratom was great at first then backfired on me. I quit Kratom. Because of my job I started using Verruckt potions again. I would use one night then get crap sleep so I would go to the next day before I knew it I was using every day for a week or two. After years on and off this stuff and quitting Kratom my stomach is messed up. Now anytime I do Verruckt potions stomach bloats like I'm 9 months pregnant and hurts. I started bloating with Kratom towards the end too. If I take too much ill projectile vomit and feel like crap. 
    
 I am glad to be off kratom. I'll go a few days now no Phenibut and the first 2 I always am tired, no energy, then day 3 start to feel good normal again. Now when I take Phenibut I feel like my mind is scattered. My body feels fat and gross and heavy. I lack ability to focus. It used to do all the opposite for me. I even lack sensitivity to be able to orgasm now while on phenibut. Anyone else have stories to compare? 
  
  I know my life will be way better not on this stuff. I don't get anxious or depressed much anymore. But I always go back to use a couple of potions when I need to deal with a stressful day at work and need to be able to fake my happiness for a few hours dealing with customers. But it imbalances me so much... now I hate the way I feel after. Same day next day. I want to break the cycle.
    
  I'm doing better but I'm wondering if Phenibut lost its ""bliss"" for anyone else? Or if anyone's having problems with their intestines, or gut. I am in pain now in my stomach if I do it the entire day. 

Thank you all for the read! Any feedback to compare stories would help so much. ♥️",8

Hey everyone! I just thought I’d share my Phenibut “story” on here, maybe it’ll give some insight or relation. Mainly just want to focus on the quitting part. I started at 900mg as my first dose and quickly found myself at 1.5gs every other day the following week. Ignoring my inner voice I snowballed into dosing higher and more frequently from then on. I found myself after 3 MONTHS at 10-12g per day and would take around 7-9gs in the morning and 2-4gs at night. Knowing how the withdrawals and side effects are, and not knowing the long term effects, I wanted out. I have other things in life I am trying to work on and dealing with the added Phenibut habit was something I had to eliminate. I also was experiencing some scary side effects. I was very concerned about going to the hospital during my taper because I saw people say they experienced withdrawals on much less than what I was doing but wanted to quit on my own. I cut the dosage in half immediately to 6gs. After 3 days I cut it down to 2gs. Once I got to 2gs per day for three days I cut it by 300mg every day. I jumped off completely at about 600mgs. I did not experience any serious withdrawals. The worst of it was just extreme out of reality anxiety (thoughts that were completely ridiculous but had an effect on me) and pain in my joints, but I am not sure if that’s because I just stopped taking care of my physical health for three months or because of the Phen. Also just irritable and felt like I wasn’t fully present. What helped me a lot was to hydrate and eat well. I found myself taking it again about two months later for three weeks. First dose was 3gs and by the third week I was at 6gpd. Then had to stop myself AGAIN and get off this stuff but this time I just took a day off from it, took 4gs the next day, and then jumped off again completely. This time no side effects at all. You all can dog me on here for the irresponsible behavior I described above because I dog myself, but I guess for people who haven’t been taking it relatively long could maybe relate to my situation. Also, this is not to encourage this behavior or to say “hey the withdrawals aren’t dangerous” because they can be, I think I am just lucky maybe. Best advice would be to take the taper as slow as you feel comfortable doing, having the want to quit, and to do it in the healthiest/safest way possible. Any questions you have please ask! Also, I see a lot of “despair” on here, don’t lose hope, you will get out of it. Again I was on it for relatively short periods of time so maybe I can’t talk but just know you’ll make it out and you’ll be better off for it.",9

I had six different varieties/ brands which I cycled through to reduce tolerance and resistance. FAA, Fadout, 500mg caps for sleep,  250 mg bottles,  HCL powder.  

 I used it 70% of the time to get through work. It increased my focus,  memory, mood, I was more talkative, confident, felt euphoric, less anxious, more empathetic, slept better and could easily deal with a grumpy cantankerous boss who never praised hard work. 

I got super excited knowing today was going to be a pheni day.  Morning workout,  coffee and some Russian super drug!  Combined with plenty of water, healthy food and exercise, most pheni days were consistently bliss. 

Side effects were on and off and mild to begin with.  Anxiety, depression, insomnia,  skeleton like feeling,  numb,  brain fog, nauseous. Just put up with it. 

I decided to start a long slow taper since mid 2019 to present. Last dose was 250mg three weeks ago

The start of this year was horrific. Full blown anxiety attacks,  tremors and sweating. It was the severe insomnia,  and suicidal thoughts that really cooked me, and made my brain go 'coo coo'

What helped

long slow taper to manageable dose
Seroquel for sleep. 
Sertraline
Valium used sparingly

For those who don't know I abused Phenibut for about six weeks, taking mild/medium doses almost daily. I am now on day 13 of being clean and the anxiety is unrelenting. I am STILL feeling like shit, horrible anxiety mixed with horrendous depression. It has been 12 days off and I have am having an anxiety/panic attack right now as I write this.

The Gabapentin my psychiatrist prescribed does not seem to be doing shit and I want to be off of that anyways. I swear to God it makes it worse at times. I have also been taking Klonopin and weaning off of that for these past couple of weeks and I think a lot of the anxiety may actually have to do with that. Thank God I am only at 0.250mg right now. The only reason I have continued to take that is because it is the ONLY thing that helps with the anxiety.

But yeah, I am going to get checked in. The only reason I haven't is because I am unfortunately stuck with my parents right now and they don't want me to go. I am going to try and convince them though. I am sick of this and need serious help. I feel like I am legitimately going insane.

I am just so confused and scared. The Phenibut withdrawal should be over right now correct? So why do I still feel like hell? Is it the benzos and Gabapentin contributing? I want to be off ALL of this shit but I am scared to be at the same time since I know how bad the withdrawals for Klonopin and Gabapentin can be as well.

Any thoughts on using bac on an as-needed basis during a taper, rather than tapering it in or switching completely? 

For example, say I drop a little too much--when it starts to hurt, add in a little bac for a few days til I'm adjusted, then remove the bac when I stabilize, and repeat? E.g. drop 500mg, add in 10mg bac for a few days til I'm stable, then drop the bac until the next pheni drop.

Asking because I'm in a situation for the next few months where I need to reduce my dosage as quickly as possible and don't really have any room for days where I'm out of commission (work, travel, time with family, etc). 

It sounds like bac is pretty fast acting, so might work as a temporary bandaid for a couple days til I adjust to reduced phenibut? I'm nervous about jumping entirely to bac, both because I don't want to run out and also because I can't have a week or two where I'm super depressed, etc.

I wrote thi cause didn't find anything about upping dose during taper.

This is my 2nd post. Now about tapering times.
I was using phenibut for few months with 16g day dose.
Last two weeks there were no benefits at all. Time to leave I thought.
This is my 3rd time with pheni so no CD this time.
My taper simply looks like that:

Immediatelly drop from 16g to 9g -feels good so far

Then drop every day 0,5g till I reach 5g
(Felt effing WD so swichted to 0,3g)

When reached 2g is was dropping 0,1g every day.
(No WDs so far)

Today I am 1,3g (I am easy irritable, feel hopless, emotional, so watching sad movie makes my cry lol! But stil managable as long as noone is around me). Good news I am close to te end :D

Now Importand question:
Could I jump dose this one time lests say 3g today? I have some important project with people at work.
Then tomorrow back on truck with 1,2g ??",6

I checked into a detox from my GHB addiction. The CAMH protocol  (center for addiction and mental health in Toronto Canada) is to load you up on an incredibly high dose of phenobarbital, and then rapidly ween you off of the addiction to an archaic barbiturate that is primarily used in pet euthanasia these days. They definitely gloat about being the knifes edge in addiction medicine, but the experience was your standard barbaric locked in a room pumped full of drugs which contains enough anti-convulsant to keep you alive, but nowhere near enough actually GABA protection to keep your long term happy safe, or your gaba receptors which have all just had the SHIT kicked out of them for the past year. 

 Anyways, one of my biggest fears is if i’m in a position, like a possible arrest, or some situation that i have absolutely no access to my supply, or am around people that are familiar with the substance, (my doctor, who is amazing learned everything she KNOWS about phenibut via reddit posts like this). I know the police well, i work with them sometimes and there is a reason i have ACAB tattooed on my arm, if you were to be in the situation where you were afraid of the consequences of ohenibut withdrawal becoming imminent, they would literally think you said fentanyl, and write you off entirely until you basically had a seizure, at which point they may help.

Been dropping 100mg every 3 days and have a big range of wd symptoms of course, but just knowing that this will all be over soon is a great bit of hope to stick to. 

These lower doses are definitely way harder but at the same time the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter and brighter :)

Does anyone know when you can make the jump to 0 kind of comfortably? Currently the plan is to keep tanking it and then do the final 3 days at 100mg before dropping.

I am ten days out from my Phenibut abuse and I still feel like shit. Horrible anxiety mixed with horrible depression. Thankfully the insomnia is gone but nearly every moment now is absolute misery for me. Granted, my situation is made even more complicated because I was concurrently abusing Phenibut along with Vyvanse, and I did a fast taper of the Phenibut and was forced to stop the Vyvanse cold turkey.

My question is does anybody else not really feel any relief from Gabapentin and Bacloffen? No idea why as everyone says those are the best things to help combat the withdrawals but for me they seem to help for a bit and then almost worsen the symptoms/withdrawals. I am going to try my best to cut them out as soon as I can because I think they are prolonging this BS.

Anybody else have an experience with this? I really and truly don't know what to do. I have never felt this bad mentally in my entire life. The ONLY thing that helps me, as awful as it is, are benzos. They just slow down my mind and allow me to feel numb which is great compared to what I feel now. I am so scared because I feel like this is never going to end and I can't shake this feeling of overwhelming hopelessness. My mind keeps telling me I am going to die and that my life is over and it really feels like it. And it sucks because I do not want to die, I really don't, there are soooo many things I still want to do.

Should I check myself into a mental hospital? I am worried about that though because I know they will just drug me up and I might feel worse. I am trying to wean off all of the drugs right now (benzos and the Gabapentin) because I really do feel like once I am off all of that I will feel better.

Sorry for this tangent, I went off track, but did anybody else not get relief from the Gabapentin or Bacloffen? I am so annoyed too because I only used for six weeks and not even in crazy doses (250mg-1500mg.)

Hello everyone. Been posting a lot here recently so I will try and keep this short.

I used Phenibut almost daily for six weeks (41 days, I counted exactly) and usually abused it in the low to medium range (250mg-1500mg.) The second to last week I did a binge of 1 gram per day and then did a rapid taper and got off within one week. The reason I tapered rapidly too was because during the binge the drug turned on me and began making me feel horrendous.

To keep a long story short, it was brutal. Went to the ER twice for severe panic attacks and the five days after being clean were hell on Earth.

Day eight now and, while I am definitely feeling better, it is still hitting me bad. Severe anxiety, depression, itching/hot skin, dissociation, complete inability to focus or do anything. I have been taking benzos (first Ativan now Klonopin) and Gabapentin to deal with this.

My question though is that I am wondering if these substances are prolonging the withdrawal? Most people say that by day eight they are out of the woodworks and it is still hitting me pretty badly. I was also a speedfreak as well (abused the sh$t out of Adderall and Vyvanse) so I am wondering if that is contributing. I was forced to cold turkey off of those as well.

Any advice? I am currently tapering off the benzoz (been on for 10 days) and then plan on getting off the Gabapentin and being done with it. I am scared though because my brain seems broken and, while I am doing better than the initial five days of pure hell/psychological torture, it just does not seem like it is letting up.

The whole phrase ""you don't know how good you have it until it is gone"" keeps hitting me. I was depressed and unhappy before this whole situation but now I would give all the $ in my bank account to go back to how I was feeling before.

There is no way this can last forever, it has to end at some point right? I have had drug scares in the past with a variety of substances (opioids, meth) but I really and truly feel like this time I have finally done it and gone and broken my brain permanently. I feel like I am truly f$cked and will be forced to spend the rest of my life as a miserable anxious/depressed cripple who will need caretaking. I'm only in my early twenties as well so this really does suck.

I have told myself if I get through this (which seems doubtful at this point) I will be committed to being sober once and for all. Drugs in general brought me more misery than enjoyment anyway (I didn't even get to do the really ""fun"" ones either like MDMA and LSD) so if I get through this I will swear them off completely. ",7

I now wake up without feeling like I need to jump out of bed to dose so I can cancel withdrawals. To those on the fence at high doses, it’s super doable, and I encourage you all to make the commitment to tapering off. Staggering the doses was very effective for me. Hopefully it can be for you too. :)",5

I've been off and on phenibut for almost 2 years. About a year ago one of my big toes went totally numb, and only improved slightly and very slowly when I got off the phenibut, but that was still an isolated incident until 1 month ago, when the neuropathy started manifesting in my hands, and unfortunately my dominant hand. I'm a musician so not being able to feel my guitar strings is causing me a lot of emotional pain. It's also effected my typing and writing.

Has anyone else experienced this? I've been using kratom for help sleeping as I'm weaning off the phenibut again. Could the kratom be the culprit? I know neuropathy can be permanent, however I'm only 30, and I've read some really positive medical articles about CET treatment for neuropathy, so if I don't regain sensation perhaps there is still hope?

Just curious if anyone else has had to deal with this as well.

I would describe it similar to fibromyalgia or neuropathic pain. I feel like 99years old or older. Then plus the depression and increased anxiety it brings.

Anyone had similar experiences having this extreme bodyaches and muscle pain similar to fibromyalgia?

So normally I wouldnt panick much as I know I really didnt overdo it much with the phenibut use (in comparison to my or other binges of a whole year daily use or 15g/day habit), normally I would go through the pain and know there is an end in the end of the tunnel soon.

But right now I have to study hatd for an exam and then write a bachelorthesis. I have to function.

I soon will get my gabapentin dose back (prescribed for depression, anxiety, sleep and pain). What do you think how should I continue? I probably get the prescription of 300mg daily only as I‘m still right in the beginning of the treatment with this med.",2

So many people on here were saying that the withdrawals were over for them in 5-7 days. 

I'm on day six of being clean off the Phenibut. I used almost daily for six weeks in mild to medium dosages and got clean off of a rapid taper after the drug started making me feel horrible. While I am definitely, for the first time, feeling a bit better (it is the first day I didn't break down sobbing or having a full on panic attack/mental meltdown), I am also definitely still feeling the withdrawals pretty strongly. 

It is already day six and I have only noticed maybe a 25% decrease in the severity. The only thing I want to ask is did anybody else have a longer withdrawal than the usual 5-7 day thing? I am almost a full week out but I highly doubt I will be feeling 100% by day 8. 

The good news is the anxiety is starting to morph into a sever depression/dissociated state, which is good because I know that is what usually comes next. I just wanted to see if it took anybody else a bit longer to fully bounce back. Thank you.",5

I joined yesterday after flipping through some posts on here looking for similar experiences to see how I can remedy my little (and yes, mine seems little compared to some of you brave souls here) problem.

My history: 28y male, moderate cannabis user, non-drinker, no other illicit substances. Generally very healthy.
I had a 6 month stint with Kratom in 2015 that left me in 2 separate withdrawals, that was my first rough experience with addiction. Made it out fine, but never looked back on kratom. No thank you, sir.

That being said about kratom, let me put on my dunce hat for this next story.

I started phenibut exactly two months ago when I received my 300mg pills through the mail. Stupidly, I started at a pretty high dose of 2700mg split throughout he first day in 3 doses. It BLEW my mind. So euphoric and what not. For the first week I used every other day, but doing a back to back dose on two of the days. I noticed sleep disturbances near the end so I decided to break after a week.

I couldn’t sleep right for a week after. That was not fun. However after that week I thought “screw it, I made it out. I’ll jump back on and I’ll be fine.”

After that, I stuck with a pretty steady regimen of anywhere between 3G-3.6G every other day. I would always dose 2.1G at 3pm and another 1.2G or 1.5G about 3hrs later. This was great for awhile, only dealing with a mixed afterglow/hangover on the days I didn’t dose. Totally manageable. I loved how freely I spoke, and the connection I felt with other people. I also felt like a sex god, and my girlfriend who had no idea I was taking phenibut also took note of that.

It wasn’t until a week ago that I started realizing that it was catching up to me. I would start getting increasing WD symptoms nearing the 48hr mark of my last dose.

It was at this point that all of my memories, dark feelings and dread from kratom came back. I was so not willing to go through any of that again, miss work, and if possible, I would rather my loved ones not worry about me. With nearly a full bottle of 300 capsules, 2 days off work ahead of me, and the knowledge I had from reading other posts here, I decided that it was now or never. I had to drop it.

Sunday was my last dose at 8pm. Total 3.6G. I had read about the success with baclofen, and I now THANK THE UNIVERSE that I have had a script for it in the past for muscle spasms because I decided to try my luck and email my doctor to see if he could fill out a script. He got back to me, on a Sunday of all days, saying “sure no problem, I’ll fill out the script.” I do realize how lucky I am, as many on here seem to have had trouble getting permission from their doc to take it. 

Now, with all ready and all in place, it was showtime.

I picked up the script on Monday and decided to see how long I could go without taking it. Mind you, I’m planning on jumping off of phenibut completely CT. This may not be the best idea for some, but I decided that with an every-other-day dosing regimen, I could probably handle it. Monday went pretty well, and I jumped in bed that night and got decent sleep.

Tuesday morning I was feeling it. Anxious and irritable, shaky muscles, the lot. Still not horrible though. But by 4pm, 1hr after what would have been my usual phenibut dose, I caved and took 2 10mg baclofen.

Let me tell you, I was surprised. Within an hour, WD symptoms were 90% gone. I was thrilled. I took one more 10mg pill at 11pm, got in bed, and woke up Wednesday morning at 6am, where I find myself at this moment as I type.

I have heard of treating phenibut with baclofen at a dose of 10mg baclofen/1 gram of phenibut. I will try to stick to 30mg baclofen per day, spaced out as needed, but preferably waiting until night so that I could sleep.

I do realize it’s still early, as I approach the 72hr mark of no phenibut at 3pm today. But I must say, all things considered, I’m feeling okay at the moment. Last baclofen dose was 8hrs ago.

Also important to note: I am not smoking cannabis at the moment because it did increase my anxiety when I tried yesterday. Along with the baclofen, I am taking different supplements with theanine, 5htp, melatonin, lemon balm, etc., the typical botanical sleep stuff.

Thank you Reddit, it’s great to be here, your posts have already provided comfort and knowledge. If I could be of any help, or if you have suggestions of questions, I’ll be here. 

Love you.

EDIT: very important to note that I am EXERCISING as much as possible. I hiked 4 miles in the hills with my GF yesterday, and I’m sure that has helped with my current state. If you can, do it!

2021-06-01 21:28:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/nqa0vb/my_taper_and_getting_there/,My taper and getting there..,"I have been taking phenibut every day for almost two years. Right now I am at 1.7 grams, tonight I will take 1.6 grams.

I was up to 3.7 earlier in the year after two or three weeks of extra doses to get through a difficult day “just this one time” (you can tell yourself this every day and believe it lol). That’s one of the reasons you have to be very clear with planning your taper, and careful to follow it.

&#x200B;

Thoughts on tapering:

I have found that 50 mg a day is easy, you hardly notice it. You can do less than 50, fine, but it will take longer. I’m hoping to get clean for a trip in 18 days. Having a goal, or setting an end date helps make the end seem real and gives you a reason to continue tapering. If you taper 100 mg / day (my current taper), it will take you 10/days per gram. Tapering 50 mg / day will take 20 days per gram. I also recommend writing down your daily dose (don’t lose track, you’d probably justify a higher dose).

Various supplements can help ease symptoms.

\>I mostly try to work out and eat healthy (I need to figure out the sleep part).

\>I highly recommend getting a large tub of theanine. You can toss and wash that shit easy, taste like nothing but doesn’t really mix anything well. I throw down a gram or so of theanine before bed, sometimes the morning or any time I start stressing.

\>I recently found “mood lift” from lift mode, which is the best I’ve found so far for staving off withdrawal symptoms.

\[It does contain Oroxylin A and Magnolol which have gabaergic activity. I’ll need to look into these more (the former appears to negate some gaba-a activity while the later seems to ""act as positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABA-A receptors. PAMs help promote the activity of receptors, but this action is dependent on stimulation of the receptors. In short, this means that Magnolol and Honokiol may help promote the magnitude of response that we see from normal activation of GABA-A receptors."" (I ripped this from a nootropicsdepot page but I would advise researching this sup if you consider it because I don’t fully understand potential interactions).\]

&#x200B;

How I got here:

Before hitting 3.7 I had gotten to 1.9 grams. I was tapering SLOW and feeling great, slightly more clear headed and alive every day. Then after going on a two week trip and bringing capsules @ 300 Mg cap, with the added pressure of being more social on a trip, I chose to round up with the caps from where my taper was and hold it at 2.1 grams. I think I was back to 2.7 by the time I went home.

I started trying to taper faster (100+, 200+ some days) to get back to my previous level after the trip. I just assumed that maybe my tolerance didn’t establish, but after the delayed withdrawal onset, I started throwing an extra gram or two in every couple days to when the panic and depression became overwhelming (I’m sure this is nothing compared to the overwhelming feeling of quitting cold turkey).

I started taking phenibut knowing full well its addictive potential. I first ordered phenibut back in 2017 using $15 worth of bitcoin I had left over from an order of miprocin (typtamine analogue rc), huge waste of money (miprocin was well spent, no regrets there). I spent two or three months the prior year (2016) developing a neurontin/gabapentin habit. Was taking  for symptoms of a now cured autoimmune disease.I quit neurontin cold turkey and had withdrawals for a month, maybe more. But they were nothing to even 1 gram of pheni (I was taking 900mg of gabapentin, some days 1800 or 2100). I went through  mild opiate withdrawals after some surgeries, nothing compared to phenibut.",5
2021-06-01 19:33:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/nq7s7b/is_it_normal_for_the_anxiety_to_start/,Is it normal for the anxiety to start transforming into depression during WD?,"Day five of being off after rapid taper. The first three days were horrendous anxiety. Starting yesterday, day 4, I began to notice an overwhelming depression setting in.

Today is day 5 and I have noticed the anxiety seems to have gotten a lot better (although it is still there of course.) The depression seems to be worse though. I can’t remember a time being this sad, miserable and hopeless. I was also forced to cold turkey off a medium sized Vyvanse dose as well (50mg.) I will admit too I abused that as well and having to go off that is no doubt making the depression even worse. I have a few IR 15mg Adderall lying around but whenever I take those, even in small doses (under 10mg), it spikes up the anxiety from the Phenibut WD and I have a massive attack. I am trapped now because if I take it I have a panic attack and if I don't I have this goddawful depression. 

Just wanted to ask though if this is normal. Hoping things will get better eventually. I feel like my abuse of both stimulants, and this more recent bout with Phenibut, have permanently destroyed my brain. The benzos I have are the only things keeping me sane but I know I can only take those for a few more days. 

I almost want to check myself into a detox facility. I have an appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist day after tomorrow (after coming clean and admitting my abuse) and I am just barring my teeth until then. Seriously hoping I make it out of this. 

I've made a promise to myself to get sober if I can get through this which, at this moment, doesn't seem likely (even if the logical side of my mind knows I will in the end.)",6

I've gotten some helpful info in this subreddit, but more often it leaves me absolutely terrified.

Am I ever going to be ok again? I've dealt with suicidal impulses for about 6-7 years.

Luckily here is been gloomy and overcast all week so I can somewhat blame the weather on my melancholy demeanor.   My work life suffers but I find relief in my occasional peaceful alone downtime, home is a game changer as I’m expected to be Dad and Husband, which is a rational expectation and I don’t think my family deserves anything less.

Can’t wait for these acute WD to subside and start the PAWS. 
At this point there’s no happiness, play games with my boy or color with my girl doesn’t give me the endorphin rush I once felt. Wife is feeling neglected and I don’t blame her for her anger. 

This too shall pass I keep repeating, my prayer is that I can get out without permanent damage to my relationships, whatever may happen to me personally, I’ll deal with. 

Down from 3-4 GPD for 5 years, down to 750mgPD 

Had baclofen but that’s gone now 
Using magnesium, 5HTP, Agamatine (gotta order more I ran out), Kratom (next target)
