At first they were not sure what phenibut really was but the Doctor here is really confident in treating me and really smart. She has seen “The” case study that is thrown around here a lot regarding Baclofen for treating Phenibut withdrawals. 

They are having me take 15mg of Baclofen 3x daily while I completely CT from phenibut. They have told me that I will be here while I switch to Baclofen but they want to discharge me and then taper over a long period of time after discharge. 

This is what I was expecting and honestly am a little disappointed that they can’t guarantee that I am off of all substances by the time I’m discharged but I am still really happy that I am currently completely off of phenibut, or at least until 5 half-lives pass. 

There is a strong possibility that they will discharge me very early depending on how well my body handles the switch from Phenibut to Baclofen. 

So my questions for you all is how well did the switch to Baclofen work? Did you switch instantly or did you taper Phenibut while titrating Baclofen? 

Hopefully I can leave with a positive experience and hopefully this switch to Baclofen will be painless. 

Edit: I should mention that I was taking 4.5GPD.

I plan to taper down to zero over the next few weeks. Unfortunately, I waited too long to order my newest bottle and it won't be here until Monday. I took 500mg this morning and now only have 1.25g to last me until whenever it arrives on Monday. How tough will this weekend be for me? I have no access to benzos or anything like that. Any advice on how to get through the weekend and Monday morning as smoothly as possible? How should I use my last 1.25g to maximize it? I'm in Canada, so I could go to the store and get a bottle of CBD oil. Would that help? I also have NAC, zinc, and magnesium that I've been taking every day, not sure if how much that will help.

I know I’ve posted about this a couple times in the past week, but here is a quick back story. I decided to quit a massive 15-20gpd phenibut addiction and a huge Kratom addiction at the same time. I decided to go cold turkey. I was into cold turkey about one day and I went to the doctor to get my blood work done and hopefully get a medication to help me sleep through some of the insomnia. My doctor prescribed me gabapentin to help, and said she’s never heard about phenibut, and that gabapentin is super safe and non addictive. She prescribed to 600mg once per day before bedtime. Before this I have literally never heard of gabapentin. First couple nights I noticed it took away some of my restless legs, but still didn’t sleep. So the next 2 nights I took 900mg and it helped even more, but didn’t sleep. So being an idiot and wanting to sleep I the next night I took 1200mg. The last two nights I’ve taken 1500mg and I’ve finally slept okay and it’s felt great. Tonight and the rest of the time I will not take over 900mg. My question is did I just screw myself over and replace phenibut with gabapentin? I’m still having WD symptoms, but not bad. I’ve now been 7 days without Kratom and 9 days without phenibut. From what I’ve read 900-1500 mg is A pretty low dose compared to taking 15-20gpd of phenibut, but I just want to be done with all pills and powders. I just have no idea if I’ve just backtracked, or this is a good start to getting clean. Really would appreciate help on this. I wish my doctor never prescribed me gabapentin, because I for sure didn’t ask for it. I’ve been talking gabapentin for 7 nights now. Once per day before bedtime.

What are the symptoms some people feel between doses towards the end or pretty much all the time then? For a high gpd user. Glutamate related? Is that called rebound and not WD or is that simply WD starting that soon? I don't even remember short acting benzo WD to start that quickly, I'd assume alcohol too. If you were prescribed alprazolam 3x day,  you wouldn't start feeling WD and really anxious before the next dose, at least I never did was on them for years when I was younger. Maybe shortly after missing the dose but not so pronounced immediately.

The physical and mental symptoms 3x day users get 6 or 7 hours after taking it is WD starting right? My problem is that the vibration feeling never really goes away even when I stay at the same dose for weeks. I'd say it gets worse between doses, but I can't tell if it's the same most of the day regardless of when I take it, maybe I just don't notice as much or care after it starts working. 

If large phenibut doses cause big spikes in glutamate and NMDA activity, could it be the reason for the interdose symptoms and the ones experienced throughout the entire day for some people like me? I'm just trying to make sense out of it. It almost feels like you'll always go into WD if you maintain your daily doses like a prescription.

About the pain & anguish that you all are suffering from by just tapering alone. So I decided to help you all out to stop the suffering once and for all and share my story. This is my second go around with getting hooked on Phenibut. The first time around I kicked it going cold turkey by just using Gabapentin, and was done in 7 days or so this past summer. Fast forward to now. So this time around I decided I would try to use it just every other day....which worked out well for a few months. But the past few weeks I slowly started to use it everyday again foolishly due to attending more social events. I was using 8-10 grams a day...and then that's when Phenibut became a nightmare again! So 5 days ago I decided it was time to quit again...going cold turkey using Gabapentin. I did this all painlessly, and even slept every night! Now I will share with you all how I did it. I had (40) 600 mg. Gabapentin pills. I took a pill every 4-6 hours (mainly every 4 hours the first 2 days) The pills usually take 2 hours to kick in after you take them, and usually work for up to 6 hours or so. So you want to make sure that they are always in your system. So to do that you take it 4 hours in, so in 2 more hours it will be kicking in while the other one is leaving your system. I would take one exactly 2 hours before I planned to go to sleep, so I could sleep at night. I also took a Diphenhydramine pill, and had baclofen tablets on standby as a backup. I also had a Gabapentin pill on standby on my nightstand in case I woke up in the middle of the night I would take it. I pretty much have slept like a baby for 4 straight nights by doing this method. I am on day 5 of my withdrawal and have not felt a thing except for minor depression yesterday that subsided quickly. I have even hit the gym after work everyday...and had a good time! So in closing my method was to use 600 mg. Gabapentin every 4-6 hours until the withdrawal is over.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9957565665245056}"

Finally I started feeling some unnatural swelling in my liver. This freaked me out bad. Thankfully I couldn’t ignore my usage any longer and decided it was time to kick these habits. I immediately cut down to 2 grams of phenibut a day. It was a rough month but I finally stabilized on 2 grams of phenibut per day. 

Around late December I placed an order for baclofen. Once it arrived I switched over pretty quickly. Went from 2 grams of phenibut a day to 50mg of baclofen spread through out the day. After about a week and I knew the phenibut was completely out of my system I requested 2 days off of work. So last Sunday I cut my kratom dose in half, around 15-20 grams. Then Monday went completely colt turkey off of the kratom. Today is day 3 and I’m at work, couldn’t be happier that I’m not on that garbage. 

Today I’m on 12.5mg of baclofen. I feel great. I know it sounds hard guys but just know that it’s possible. I couldn’t have done it without this sub and god on my side.

First off, thank you again for everyone’s feed back on my insomnia post. I have been tapering pretty well now (50mg daily, sometimes every other day) and I’ve been sleeping better by doing a large dose at night and dosing twice a day. 

My question is this; I have a family emergency that is making me travel. I have... what I think is about 35g left plus a bottle of 250mg capsules. So I’m guessing I’m at least good for 10 days but I’m an over worrier still... I have some on the way but I’m fearful it won’t arrive in time. 

I don’t have Baclofen, but I do have Gabapentin 600mg tabs. Would this help in my taper at all? Or as a last minute thing if I ran out to help keep me out of severe withdrawal? How does one equate Gabapentin when using it in lieu of Phen? Or how can it be used in a taper?

I am FREE. This substance is so insidious. I have not had one bit of fun on it since I can even remember, I just use it to stay out of withdraw.  I have many recovery friends but I felt I could not talk to anyone about this, any inpatient program near where I live would just give you benzos. That would make me go psychotic in a few days if I was cold turkey on the gaba-B stuff. Like many people here I got hooked from gas station energy shots, I never would have thought trying to quit them would put me in the hospital with psychosis

At the hospital I  told them the exact truth of what was happening, that I was in phenibut withdraw and needed to detox. They shot me full of Ativan, kept me overnight and discharged me, I was not even out of the worst part of the withdraw. Thank god for this sub and the lessons of baclofen. Remember 1g then = 10mg bac. I just swapped the bac for the Phenibut and then tapered the bac. It made me pretty manic for awhile but now that is over. I think in a few weeks I will feel like my normal self.  Tapering baclofen is nothing like phenibut you are not just swapping out one thing for another, you are replacing something that is almost impossible for some people to taper with something that is easy to taper.

They took me in and I ended up sitting on a gurney for about an hour. The tests apparently came back negative which I absolutely disagreed with. I was exhibiting every symptom of insecticide poisoning. I called bullshit and ordered them to keep me because I was scared about what was to come. The doc came in and I eventually had my first psychotic break of that night. My reality slipped out from underneath me. Apparently, the class of insecticides called organophosphates are commonly used in kratom production and they can cause substance induced psychosis. However, sometimes the manufacturers forget to clean off the leaves before they powderize them. My batch was a bad batch and it kicked me in the ass.

I was then given 50mg Ziprasidone and admitted to intensive care. This is where the real hell started. They wouldn't let me use my phenibut. I was taking 5-7gpd and I knew exactly what was coming based on my personal knowledge of the withdrawal from that dosage. What came was exactly what I was expecting. I explained to them the pharmacology of Phenibut and they started giving me 10mg baclofen and 600mg gabapentin every 6 hours. I explained to them that this dosage wasn't enough and explained to them the baclofen-phenibut ratio (10mg Baclofen = \~0.9 grams Phenibut), but they refused to give me more than 20mg baclofen every 6 hours with 10mg diazepam every 3 hours. This absolutely wasn't enough. The bell curve of Phenibut withdrawal was really kicking my ass.

At first I had the rebound symptoms which were manageable. However, around 18 hours later, the worst of the symptoms quickly made themselves apparent. Within 2 hours I was hallucinating with a similar intensity to 200mcg LSD with moderate-severe derealization. Not a good combination. I told them that I was hallucinating and having bad derealization and that Psychosis was imminent and they said my next baclofen and gabapentin was in an hour. I started pacing around my room saying fuck over and over again as the derealization, anxiety, and hallucinations grew stronger. And then, boom, reality was broken. I screamed ""no, no, fuck, no, this isn't happening fuck"" and ran out with no control of my body to the front desk and told them that I was going thru psychosis and to give me 20mg baclofen and 600mg gabapentin right now or it was going to get worse. I started thinking that they were doing it on purpose maliciously and completely believed it and started accusing them of it. 

I was yelling at them about how they were intentionally torturing me in order to show me hell and security had to walk me back to my room. Around 5 minutes later baclofen and gabapentin were wheeled into my room with a cup of water. I refused the water because I thought they had poisoned it and insisted on drinking my hot chocolate because I didn't trust them. The entire time I was taking the pills I was viciously insulting them, calling them faggots (not something I do like ever), devil's minions (I don't even believe in organized religion), assholes, threats to hurt them if they did that kind of thing again (which got security involved again), threats to make myself throw up on the floor outside my room, etc. I was just completely disconnected and filled with extreme rage and I probably would have tried something stupid if it wasn't for the ativan I was given 45 minutes prior.

I remember laying down and waiting for the drugs with my eyes closed and the visuals were absolutely ineffable. By far the most detailed and disturbing hallucinations I've ever seen. I kept hearing my name yelled from the front office. Every time I ran in hastily and none of them ended up calling my name. In the moment, I thought they were just fucking with me which made me more aggravated. I was clacking my teeth and they had corresponding extremely detailed synesthesic hallucinations which made me confused as to where my teeth were. I kept seeing my room change. There was blood dripping from the walls and at one point it looked like it had been bombed. I also kept feeling like I was on the side of the wall and the bathroom, tv, and lounge were actually the floor and if I moved I would fall. I even felt pulled down so I had to grab onto the top of the bed. This filled me with anxiety because I felt as if I fell, I would die. There were constantly highly detailed tall figures in mirrors and windows that made me feel like I was being watched.

When I took the baclofen and gabapentin I was immediately relieved. They gave me 30mg Baclofen and 900mg Gabapentin this time, which helped immensely. Within 20 minutes, my reality was back to normal and the hell was over. They ended up keeping this dose every 4 hours and it prevented the withdrawal from becoming that intense. I was still anxious as hell, but as long as I wasn't hallucinating, I was fine.

Phenibut withdrawal is no joke. So far Phenibut has had the MOST severe and visceral withdrawal I've ever experienced. I withdrew from 6 months of 10-20mg Clonazepam and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut withdrawal. I've withdrawn from 150-200mg hydrocodone and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut. I withdrew from a bottle of vodka every day for 4 months and it wasn't SHIT compared to phenibut withdrawal.

I'll start by saying that I've been using phenibut for a few years. Until this year though, I always followed the instructions to limit my doses and space them out. Earlier last year, I had some painful things go on in my life, and in the end, my discipline wavered. Starting in July, I was taking 5-10GPD and only stopped when I ran out and I hadn't ordered any more. Boy howdy, that four days was my first rodeo with the demonic side of this compound. Nauseated by washcloths? Nauseated by the depraved sexual nonstop film playing behind your eyes? Hell, nauseated by everything.

The next orange tub arrived, and, with a scale, I resolved to be more responsible this time around, going down 100 mgPD. And that worked really well until about 1GPD, when I started to get WDs again. So I went back up to 2.5GPD. This continued until I actually was fully off, but jumped back up to tapering again after a bad hangover made turn to scoop for a cure. My using in the fall and winter got truly terrible, though. I was taking it every day without tapering, taking it with alcohol, other depressants, whatever. 

The about two weeks, I started not being able to sleep. Drifting off after guzzling down scoop after scoop of crystals, only for \*\*BZZZZZZT\*\*, \*GAAAAAASP\* every time I'm right there. So naturally I tried to solve my problem with more phenibut. I'm not sure what my final number is, but it's probably in the 14-18G range. However, it does nothing. I haven't slept or eaten more than a bite or a 20-minute blackout since Febrary 7.

I even did the deed and went to the ER. The Dr. first seemed like an ass and was going to give fluids and some IV nausea medication, that's it. Once he eventually got in touch with the Poison Control Center, he prescribed me some Ativan and told me he hoped they helped, but he was in ""uncharted territory."" Of course, they didn't fucking work.

In addition to the Ativan, I also have Baclofen that I bought back during my first withdrawal episode. I tried taking an amount of Baclofen equivalent to the highest dose or phenibut, but it was the same kind of deal, brain buzzes, then it wears off. But honestly, I'm at a loss as to what to do.

Phenibut making it harder to Breath,"So I’ve used Phenibut for about 5 months now, and I’ve 100 percent abused it. I know I’ll get some comments saying “you’re is the reason this shit will get banned”, and I’m sorry. I fucked up. So my habit started small, but for the last month I have taken about 15 gpd. I’ve always had a super high tolerance to any medication, and I’m 215 pounds, but I know this is a stupid amount. About 4-5 days ago two hours after taking 12grams in the morning I got super light headed and very very short of breath. I debated going to the ER. I couldn’t catch my breath and my body was posted. After a couple hours it got a little better. Has anyone else ever had this problem? First time it’s happened to me. I did some research and realized how dumb I was being so the next day I cut my dose down to 8grams and expected to feel some WD symptoms. It’s been about three days of 8gpd and my breathing has a little better, but I’m still short of breath. I just went to the gym and felt pretty good and breathing was fine. Should I be expecting some WD symptoms? I remember once going 24 hour without Phenibut and I felt awful until my mail arrived and I got more, but this time it’s been 3 days and all I feel is a little less energy and a little off. I take Kratom Several times per day and I’ve also noticed I can’t really feel the effects of that now either ever since that scary day of being super short of breath. Am I just lucky? Has anyone else experienced shortness of breath during the day almost all day? And how did you get it to go away? I’ve always noticed I’ve been sleeping wayyy better after cutting down to 8gpd Instead of 15. At 15 I had awful insomnia and couldn’t sleep. Please help!

I have yet to start a real, scheduled taper but I think now might be the perfect time. It seems I’ve hit some sort of ceiling effect with phenibut HCL... has anyone else experienced this?? I’ve been very slowly raising my dosage in increments of anywhere from 0-50mg per day for the past 8 months. In doing so basically every day I’ve felt the same effects: increased energy, sociability, motivation, great sleep, less anxiety, etc. and it lasts all day. I dose once every morning as soon as I wake up. 

Once I hit 12 grams exactly all those feelings only last about 6 hours and they’re not nearly as pronounced. I’m finding it more difficult to stay motivated, I’ve been feeling extremely depressed and crazy tired especially in the middle of the day even though I’m prescribed 60mg of Adderall daily. My stomach feels fucked up all the time and I’ll randomly get nauseous. I’ve even developed some sort of weird twitchiness in my toes and feet towards the end of the day and I can’t stop moving them around. 

A little side note: I think the toe movement could either be the phen or the Adderall generic I have right now though (possibly both). Which might sound a little stupid but after doing some research into generic Adderall IR apparently loads of other people are dealing with severe side effects from specific manufacturers of the generic recently. Regardless I’ll get back to the point: none of these things ever happened in the past 8 months until I hit 12 grams.

There’s been days where I’ll try to raise my dosage by just a little less than 50mg and I’ll be dizzy/sleepy/drowsy as hell all day and no amount of Adderall and caffeine will wake me up. I’m a full-time college student and I really can’t afford to have a single non-productive day (as I’m sure most people also can’t). So I’m not exactly sure where I’m at with a stable dose. 

I honestly think I might even feel better cutting my dose down a little bit... This morning, on Friday 2/14, I finally lowered my dose and took 11.8 grams which is 300mg less than what I normally would’ve taken. That was about an hour ago and I feel alright. A little sleepy but I’ve been feeling sleepy every morning for the past week or so. I used to get an energy/motivation boost when taking my phen in the morning with my Adderall and a caffeine pill but that doesn’t really happen anymore.

I've found a lot of comfort in not feeling alone in this.  I want to make this post because I see very few other people with my size habit tapering so I will document as I go in case someone else may benefit.  


OK quick backstory.....I have dabbled in phenibut for around 6 years.  Never using abusively because I was aware of the very real withdrawals that can occur.  Fast forward to 10 months ago.....I started dabbling again (after maybe 2 years of no use at all).  


For awhile I did fine at once a week.....but somewhere in there I developed amnesia about what could happen and started really binging.  Some days up to 4 grams. Damn did I feel great about 4 times.  


Anyway, my memory magically reappeared about 3 months ago and I've been developing a taper plan since then. Started at LEAST 4 times now only to never get passed day one.  


This time I just have to get this done. I am not a tapering person because my self-control sucks, but I think I've read enough now to motivate me to try as hard as I can.  Here's my plan....

I'm stable at 1 gram per day divided in two (500mg morning and again at 4pm).  My plan is to drop 100mg a week.  Actually 50mg every 3-4 days.  I ordered agamtine after doing copious research and was happy to read everything I did.  They are looking into it as an anti-depressant even.....will keep reading about it.  Interesting as hell.  


Anyway......I am taking 500mg of agamatine with each dose right now, but plan on tapering off the agmatine as I progress too.  Maybe not as quickly as the phenibut? anyway, I'm not concerned about the agmatine right now.  


Does this sound like a crazy slow taper, or just right? todays 50mg drop is so far no issue.  I don't expect it to be either.  I have a mini arsenal ready, too.  I'm one of those sensitive people who notices every additional heartbeat (but not a hypochondriac) and I decorate cakes for a living so I need to have energy, smile and all that happy sh\*t.  Can't take days off either (part owner).  


Along with the agmatine I have some Cats claw, green tea, passionflower, valerian, melatonin, magnesium citrate, multi-vitamins, homemade kefir, indica MJ, sleepy time tea, & ashwagandha.  


I don't plan on over supplementing and most of those will be 'on demand'.  The ashwagandha will probably be a daily herb for recovery after the taper is over. It takes awhile for adaptogens to build up and do their thing anyway from what I've read.  Probably do a course of milk thistle too once done for an extra detox measure.  


I'll be starting a daily workout routine so long as energy holds up. Heck, I'll just do yoga and stretching at first. Also plan on starting my old forgotten meditation routine, too. That's the hope.  


I'm trying really hard to not denigrate myself along with everything else.  When I hate myself every road is paved with crumbled intentions (very sharp ones and I'm walking barefoot).  


Good luck everyone.  I'm kind of mainly posting this for me to document the progress, too. My memory gets wonky lol. If you made it through this congrats!  


TL;DR  
10 month habit, many binges, but last 3 months stable at a gram a day, started taper today --will be dropping100MG a week (dropping 50mg every 3 or 4 days).  Hoping I have a fairly easy off ramp cuz I know I overstayed my welcome. Peace.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9298495650291443}"

idk, just the last few days ive been working and the whole time im basically unable to focus on my work, just about how i would love to be dead and not have to go through anything like this again. its really just been mental torture over the last few days for me. usually in the evening im able to relax better and think nicer thoughts but ive just been struggling super hard this past week with suicidal thoughts all day.

i know i have family and friends that care for me.. but this thought of ending it just lingers all day and at times gets a lot stronger into my mind and scares me a bit. i don’t want to die, but i do want this to be over so i can work on getting myself to be happy sober.

i almost want to just fucking go cold turkey so it will all emd quicker but my gaba receptors are probably so fucked from years of abuse it most likely wouldnt be a great idea.. anybody have any tips or tricks on how to make my mind ease up on me a bit? deep breathing and exercise havent been helping, and they usually do. i just feel so stuck at the moment i dont know. i guess i wanted to rant on how im feeling also.. thanks to anybody that reads this and i hope everyone is doing alright with their process!",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9972455501556396}"

Should I start a taper or introduce a very small dose?,"Hello all, I've been an on-off phenibut consumer for a number of years but never really had a problem with it until recently, and could always cease use immediately, experience an afterglow the following day, and no symptoms from then on out. However, after some daily binges, weeks at a time, the past couple months. I've found it a little difficult. I basically did a fast ""taper"", using capsules to approximate, and have had none for the last four days. I've been getting all the symptoms I see here: stomach/GI issues, anxiety, lethargy, brain fog, anhedonia, blurred vision, tinnitus, tiredness but inability to sleep, very few mild headaches, very few mild feelings of chest tightness, and RLS as well as sore muscles in my legs and sometimes back. Symptoms increase as the day goes on in the later evening. I've luckily not experienced anything like ""brain zaps"", seizures, or other severe symptoms I see some mention on here.

I've considered starting a small dose to taper and see if this eases some of the effects. Out of curiosity, I got a 0.001 g digital scale and weighed out the amount I put in the capsules. It was much less than I anticipated: between 350 and 500 mg give or take. During my bouts of excessive use, I never really kept track of how much I was taking (usings scoops and even spoons to toss/wash) but assumed it to be much, much more. I don't have any of the other meds people recommend on here such as baclofen, gabapentin, clonidine, etc, although I've considered them the past few days. I'm unsure if my case necessitates it. I've also heard people swear by a gradual taper, going down little by little over an extended period of time, stating that it leaves you with virtually no symptoms. Would it be necessary to have a replacement med such as the baclofen, or would I be able to just taper down to nothing with phenibut without any problem (should I decide to taper)? I only use kratom (as I'm already a kratom eater), teas, ashwagandha (occassionally), and magnesium citrate (occassionally), along with vitamins and benadryl for sleep.

I have some obligations the end of this week and would like the lessened anxiety, sleep problems, and sharper cognitive abilities very much, with the smallest dose possible, and in hopes that I can start a long taper that would alleviate the w/d. Anecdotally, I've heard the length of w/d and the severity is much lessened, and I'm worried about long term lingering effects/symptoms. I'm worried about the opposite being true, of course as well, and don't want to prolong the w/d

Any advice on whether to start a taper now, the dose/freq/timeframe, and if I need any meds would be greatly appreciated. I would like to hear any similar personal stories. Particularly with individuals who have started CT w/d and implemented a taper later on.

I quit Phenibut last January after a 6 month bender upon discovering it. I was up to 17 grams a day. I was able to get prescribed gabapentin 600mg 3 times a day. I used gabapentin to taper and then jump off phenibut. Successfully did it with minimal withdrawl. Tried to quit cold turkey before the gabapentin or tapering and it was hell on wheels. Since abstaining from phenibut I've continued to take gabapentin as prescribed mostly for anxiety. 

Fast forward to the last few months. I'm still on gabapentin. I've been abusing my script taking 4-10 600mg tablets a day. I eventually run out and withdrawl until I can refill. Last month ive been taking 10 a day or more (haven't been counting) and I'm down to 9 left. My refill is not until the 28th, more the 2 weeks away. I'm afraid of heavy withdrawls once I run out in a day or two so I just ordered an overnight shipment of 120gram Phenibut tub. I sat and debated it for a while between ordering the 45 gram capsules bottle or the 120 gram tub. I ended up with the 120 gram tub of loose powder. 

The plan was to take maybe 250mg 4 times a day, =1gram, until the 28th when I can refill my script but I'm kind of worried that I'm about to fuck up again and go down this rabbit hole of hell. My addictive tendencies lately are getting worse so thats my sign that I'm probably not going to do what I say Im going to do. 

Do yall think this a really bad idea? Or might i be possible to just use till I get my script and then I can just go back to my prescribed dose? I'm seriously conflicted here. A part of me wants to return the tub once it gets here. Another part of me wants to shove my face into the tub as soon as it gets here and celebrate.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9994440674781799}"

This current journey with phenibut started in late February 2019. I had been 4 months sober from alcohol, was planning on going to two large mardi gras parades and carelessly determined to have a good time, without alcohol. I had messed with phenibut before in late 2017 and quit CT after a month, somewhat naive to how it worked and scared of where it was leading.

I'm not sure how it escalated. I can't remember how low or high of a dose I started taking. Only took it one day for the first parade, and waited a week for the next parade, because I knew I was playing with fire. Well, unfortunately somehow ended up taking it daily, would log the doses, the times, the dates, but they're all in my notes on my old phone.

I've been steady at 8-12gpd now. I'm slowly tapering but getting upset with myself for the long road ahead and how I'm battling this demon by myself. I've tried to taper before but would bounce back to the same amount after a week or two. haven't been to a doctor in almost a year, but I have an appointment with one tomorrow morning. I'm a new patient, also trying to get back on my antidepressant. (long story short, I lost medicaid in March 2019 and was without insurance until last month). I'm not sure how many visits before I should consider asking for help, or how to go about it, or if I even should. I'm not sure what to mention or if I should bring in a printed explanation of what I'm dealing with.

   * Day 1: 6.5g phenibut, 10mg baclofen (10mg baclofen only in the evening)

The one thing that I know has changed is that the muscle in my left shoulder and pec have shrunk. Like, when I'm lifting... I can lift the same so I haven't lost strength but my muscles look like they're half the size of my right (dominant) side. 

I've still got the zaps in my hands and feet and the occasional shaking in different body parts. Although, those aren't happening as much anymore. So that's a positive. 

Anyways... I've had a few of you guys tell me that you've experienced neurological issues and others tell me that my symptoms CAN'T be related to phenibut. 

Overall, dropping a gram+ has been pretty good so far. 

What do y'all think about the neurological problems? Could I have screwed myself up for good OR do I have Multiple Sclerosis or something and phenibut covered up my worse symptoms until recently?

Am I imagining everything?

I'd really appreciate your thoughts!",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990973472595215}"

So, I guess as a slight disclaimer, this might not technically be related strictly to quitting, but it is somewhat relevant for my own personal journey to quit and I figure it belongs better on here than r/phenibut.

I've been taking 10g/day since around mid September, taking my dose each day all at once. At first, it was pretty much just what you'd expect, feel really good for about 12 hours, then feel normal for another 12 until I took my next dose. After a couple months, though, I started noticing that I was starting to feel really, really bad a while after dosing. I'd get the same good feeling for 12 hours, then feel normal for maybe another 5 or 6, then feel like absolute garbage until I took my next dose.

The feeling is a bit hard to describe, but I'll do my best. It kind of feels like my body is ""vibrating"". I'm not actually physically shaking, it's just this kind of internal ""vibrating"" sensation, like a sort of ""energy"" running through my body. I also tend to get in a bad mood that I can't describe very well, either. It's not an anxious or depressed feeling, just kind of a general bad mood. I would almost describe it as stress, except there's no external factor to stress me out. This is fairly minor in comparison to the body feeling, though, and the weird body feeling might actually be a big contributer to the bad mood.

Now, this definitely doesn't feel anything like withdrawals. I've gone through withdrawals before and they weren't anything like this. When I had withdrawals, it was mostly mental, and primarily just hellish levels of anxiety. This is mainly a body feeling, with some minor mental aspects to top it off.

Now, when I only had to deal with this for 8 hours or so, it was no big deal, but lately it's been coming on earlier and earlier. It started coming 12 hours after dosing, which I could deal with, but now it's been coming on even sooner. I'm making this post because, currently, it's barely been 8 hours since dosing and I already feel terrible. 

I know my description might make it sound not that bad, and admittedly, it's not the worst feeling ever, but it makes it very difficult to do just about anything. I don't have a job right now, so luckily, I don't have to worry about that, but everything from sleep to social interactions is made much more difficult because of this weird feeling. Now that I basically only feel normal for 8 hours a day, I'm at a point of hardly being functional. My sleep has gotten terrible, and I've been having to put off going out with friends or visiting family constantly because of it.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on, and if it's something that can be fixed? It's gonna be a lot more difficult to taper with this, as I'm not gonna feel very inclined to reduce my dose when it's the only relief I get from this feeling.

Any advice is appreciated, thank you!

Edit: Also, if it's worth noting at all, I usually take 900mg of gabapentin 12 hours after my phenibut dose (with oil and a fizzy drink, doses spaced half an hour apart). I still get the weird feeling with or without it.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9974254965782166}"

How much help would baclofen give me if I started integrating that instead? I feel like I should be OK because now at 1gpd I'm steady again. I have no experience with baclofen but I have to work and would love to hear your experiences.",1,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9175078272819519}"

I experienced severe hallucinations and panic attacks. 

Fast forward about a year later and I decided to take a 2 gram dose one time just to remember what it was like. 4 days after that dose I started experiencing some withdrawal symptoms again but tried to ignore it and deny it was happening. I’ve been drinking some beers to get rid of the anxiety every now and then but yesterday the alcohol stopped having any effect and I was actually feeling more anxious after I drank. Last night I just stopped drinking because it wasn’t working. 

I was trying to fall asleep thinking I’d be good with some thc in my system, when my heart jumped out of no where when I had my eyes closed. I immediately sat straight up and my heart began to pound relentlessly just as I remember the year before. I started freaking out at the realization I could be having withdrawal panic attacks! I thought it would stay at that level but it only started getting worse when my carpet started to change colors and morph into shapes. I was hearing people laughing hysterically downstairs in my house but it was 1 am and i was the only one home! I began thinking I was being punished by whoever was downstairs for taking phenibut, and that they were laughing at me for what I was experiencing. I slowly started feeling like I just popped a tab of bad acid. I then downed a handful of tranqs I was prescribed for my anxiety disorder and soon fell asleep despite my heart pounding out of my chest. 

I woke up this morning and I feel fine now despite what happened last night. I was planning on drinking again in a few hours but I’m not sure if this would trigger the withdrawal again? Anyone have any thoughts on whether I should stop drinking or whether it would be ok to continue doing so?",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9979608058929443}"

Digestion issues,"I’m the guy who was taking 40g a day for about a year and a half. I honestly always try tapering but then go back up because i can’t work when i’m constantly anxious and can’t even look at anyone in the face (i was borderline acrophobic before phenibut) Well it’s caught up to me now. i’ve been tapering really slow i get to 30grams and then get stuck and then sometimes go up and down. But there’s no more of that i’m going to need to speed up because now health issues have finally arise. 3 days ago out of nowhere my kidneys started hurting really really bad like my lower left back and my lower left stomach and it had felt like i got kicked in the balls and had nausea and still been having slight nausea and fatigue. My stomach has just been rumbling like crazy and i have a lot of stomach discomfort and pain mainly as the night approaches and in the morning before my dose. Lots of diarrhea. I’m fucking terrified. I have a doctors appointment next week. I’m only going to be working part time now so by the time my anxiety starts hitting it’s peak my shift will be over. I ordered some agmatine that’s coming sunday. This is literally my only hope to be able to cut larger doses faster as i’ve seen people successfully do in many reports, Which in turn will hopefully help my stomach feel better. I made a post saying how this stuff was gonna kill me months ago and here we are now. Time is ticking and i really don’t know if i even have 4 months to finish tapering when my stomach is begging me to stop NOW. I wasn’t even gonna post this because i’m embarrassed and i wanted to talk to a doctor before the internet getting scared on the internet but if somehow anyone has any tips to ease my stomach discomfort that’s why i’m posting this. I’m praying the agmatine helps. Im going to try knocking off a chunk of my dose with it right off the bat. I’m scared and regretful. I feel like it may be too late. This has made me not even give a fuck about the tinnitus or smaller issues i was worried about anymore, and the fatigue has actually helped me get 8 hours of sleep so i guess there’s two positives? (not really) I’m not even religious but i’m praying i make it out of this.",6,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988334774971008}"
