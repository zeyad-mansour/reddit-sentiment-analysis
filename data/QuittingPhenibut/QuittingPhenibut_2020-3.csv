The have Tianeptine(which I am very familiar with) and Phenibut. They only issue, I have ZERO idea how much Phenibut I’ve been taking. I ordered some Tianeptine sodium and have been using it to taper. But today(day three without ZaZa) I swore I was having a heart attack(at the time) I was in a panic so bad and my heart was RACING/POUNDING I almost called an ambulance. This cold, fear feeling, would grip my stomach and heart. I can only assume is was an EXTREME panic attack. Also, I was taking more than my usual Tia doses to try and combat it, to no avail.
Sent my wife to get a bottle of ZaZa and I took half the bottle around 6:50pm around 9:00pm the panic attacks went away. I was trying to control my heart rate through breathing, but couldn’t. It took everything I had to calm myself down and it lasted for hours. Prolly from 5:00pm~ until the ZaZa kicked in. 


Straight up SCARED me. Besides the obvious, tapering, any other advice? I prolly need to get some straight Phenibut and find out what my actual per day is. Because tapering by dropping a capsule off here or there doesn’t work due to the caps not being evenly distributed, IMO. 

Sorry if this post is all over the place, I’m still in a bit of a panic feeling.",4

Phenibut is a great substance when used smartly and carefully, but it can quickly get out of hand. I was taking about 6-8 grams a day for about 4 months and realized the time was now to taper and stop.

 I was able to instantly start taking only about 2-3 grams a day. I thought I would feel like crap going to such a low dose but there was literally no downside. In fact, I felt better than when I took the higher dose. I couldn't believe it. I Took that for about a week then the next week went down to a gram. The week after I stopped. Literally zero withdrawal or side effects. Going on a week off and feeling so clear-headed and happy. It's a lot of weight off my shoulders.

So guys if you've been wanting to quit for a while but were utterly dreading the withdrawal,  just know that it might not be as hard as you thought.",15

2020-03-29 12:34:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fr8nea/anecdote_on_tapering/,Anecdote on tapering,"I think this sub is really useful and I just want to give an annecdote because I think they are useful. I’m currently tapering off of a a 3gpd habit of about 6 months. It’s going really well and I actually am feeling better than I normally do most of the time. I’m also tapering off nicotine (JUUL to nicotine pouches) so that may have something to do with it as well. I’m down to 1.75g and going down by .25 g a day.

I know a lot of you have worse habits than me, but I just feel like sharing what’s been helpful for me.

I think the biggest thing that helps is splitting the dose if you usually take it all in one dose. They don’t have to be equal sized doses and my recommendation would be having the normal time that you take your dose be the biggest at first and then gradually push the biggest dose to be at night so that you don’t have trouble sleeping.

The hardest part so far was the first day that I split the dose. I took 1 g in the morning and was on a work call and felt like I couldn’t think at all and felt hot and sweaty. If I changed it now I would have done 2g in the morning and then 500 mg at lunch and 500g before bed.

Splitting the dose is harder at first, but it makes reductions much less noticable. I was dying to take my lunch dose the first day, but today, I’ve only taken 500 mg this morning and I don’t have any urge to take it again. I’m fairly certain I could go ct right now, but I will finish the taper.

My biggest fear is not being able to sleep and so far I haven’t had any problems with my taper.",5

Since this coronavirus shit happened, I’ve been unemployed and haven’t had the funds to purchase phenibut, so I basically had no choice but to go full cold turkey for like three days.  That shit was scary.  I know we all handle wd’s in our own ways, but this was something I’ve never encountered before.  The wd’s were slightly manageable, not a lot of anxiety, but I had these body zaps, feeling depersonalized, intense insomnia, and a certain feeling that I could slip into a seizure at any time.  What do I do here?  The emergency rooms are off the table because they’re flooded with people that think they have coronavirus but just have a case of the sniffles, and time is running out.  I thought Kratom could help me get through this but it’s proven useless against it.  Idk what to do here",6

Now that The Netherlands closed down schools and lots of other places this means that I basically have at least 4 months to taper my Phenibut addiction. I noticed myself still taking more Phenibut than usual and I remembered my last post here, which was like half a year ago, where I posted something like ' how to quit Phenibut in 11 days'.

At the time I did a pretty good job tapering Phenibut with Gabapentin and Baclofen but I didn't hold up with it (I started using Phenibut because of a Fear Of Public Speaking issue in English class because we had to give presentations.)

Now I already came down from 15 Grams Phenibut to 10 gram without medication. And from now on I'm determined to keep tapering until Im free from this terrible addiction.

I need to apologize for leaving this forum when I started using. I was doing many updates with tapering and was very active here. But I suddenly like, left. Maybe it's shame. Anyway. We're all here because we want to get better right?! I want to get better. And not take hands full op phenibut capsules every morning. And the fear of Phenibut being 'sold out' or worse.

NOW IS THE TIME FOR ME. If I'm not doing it now. I'll never do it ever, in my life. Admit: if you have to choose. Tapering during a lock down and isolation in your country or Tapering in your holidays, or during 'normal life routine'. I guess you would like to taper in a situation that is comfortable. Like your house, couch and bed.

62 days ago I went to A.A I cold turkey’d everything and went threw wds on multiple chemicals still went to work ect took my lick right... I did not cold turkey phenibut went the taper route obviously was able to start 5gdp with some wds but couldn’t really tell if it was phenibut because of everything else I was getting off of. stayed at 5 then within a few weeks I was able to get down to 2gpd was facing some wds doing it at this speed lost a bit of weight started getting a little dangerous so I started running into problems so I stayed at 2 gpd for a bit balance it out from there my taper was to fast and I wasn’t using my scale right so I went back to the drawing board and I have been doing -15mg a day haven’t ran into any problems doing this (are very minimal maybe a little shaky teeth with caffeine sometimes if I put my teeth close together if that makes sense)I am at 1.5gpd now

I found l Theanine,ashwag, multi victim, melatonin, proper diet, and weight lifting very beneficial I actually got some strength gains and looking a lot better.

Anyhow I am a barber and I can’t go back to work at least for another 3 weeks because of this virus situation, if I would say start a more aggressive taper would that lower my immune system and making the virus worst if I caught it. Would a more aggressive taper make this situation even worst mentally I am thinking it would but I have a slight thought to my head i am like fuck dude I want off of this shit, another question do you guys think I can just go down 15mgs the whole time are will I have to adjust when I get down to let’s say 1gpd to like -10 mgs

I never left the parking lot and was found unconscious and taken to the hospital.

I really need to get off this stuff.  I’ve been reading posts here and there seems to be folks having success with both baclofen and agmatine.

I’m reducing by 50mg/day and wondering if I should try one of these?

In fact, if anyone has had a bad (or good, too) experience or has reasons why any of these aren't recommended, please comment with further info.  I haven't seen a master list here anywhere and felt that if even one person was helped by this list it's worth my time.

NMDA ANTAGONISTS:agmatine, magnesium.  Many find agmatine assisting a great deal with tapers and glutamate excitotoxicity.  I've found that myself.

VITAMINS & AMINO ACIDS that help nervous system and other aspects of withdrawal: Vitamin B6, zinc, senior vitamin combos like centrum silver (they contain extra nutrients some regular multi's don't).  Fish oil, taurine, glycine, potassium, selenium.

CALMING HERBS (GABA A) chamomile, lemon balm, passionflower, bacopa, valerian

Ashawagandha ( GABA A and B)

OTHER CALMING SUPS: kava (maybe search for a tincture?), l-theanine

FOR SLEEP: Benadryl ,melatonin, 5-htp, indica strains of marijuana,magnesium

REDUCING GLUTAMINE: lithium orotate, boron, iodine, agmatine, magnesium, fish oil, potassium, melatonin, l-theanine, zinc, low carb keto, very small dose DXM (50-100mg)

MEDITATION: it lowers glutamate as it activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

AFTER TAPER: creatine with exercise, DLPA, maybe ALCAR (still have to research that one more).

EXERCISE: every day I get out in nature even if it's cold.  I always feel just a little bit better after that.  Trees reduce glutamate? lolol....just a thought.

INTERMITTANT FASTING: lots of science for that one, but if your appetite is screwed from phenibut, you probably already do that and maybe nutrition is more important?

PROBIOTICS: to help restore the mess left (but start right away)....beneficial gut bacteria is absolutely essential for every single function we have (the second brain after all).  Making homemade kefir is the most affordable and best way since you'll know the good guys are active (drug store probiotics can be pretty sketchy and inconclusive).  Lots of excellent info on kefir out there.  Make smoothies using fresh fruit----then you'll be providing prebiotics for the new bacteria to thrive. Add protein powder to make it more a meal.  Other good prebiotics are green bananas and cold potatoes.  Lots of veggies too.

As I've said many times over---we are all different and have different underlying health states.  It's your own responsibility to understand what supplements you use and how they interact with one another,

I'd never use ALL OF THESE and in my own taper am using things situationally.  The ones I am SURE work for me are agmatine (allowing me to pretty much effortlessly taper 100mg a week for the last 6 weeks).  Melatonin is helping me sleep straight through the night (was having issues with that even before phenibut !).  I use that multi I mentioned along with magnesium twice a day.  Zinc & fish oil every day.  I have passionflower or lemon balm tea mid-day instead of coffee (it makes me more jittery than it used to for sure).    Probiotics every single day (that kefir I mentioned). Meditation and exercise, avoiding most news.....listening to music I forgot about.  It all seems to help me get through during the weird times we're all living in (on top a taper).

Anyway, this post is very disjointed and jumbled but maybe someone can get a bit of relief along the this rocky path. Good luck everyone.",24

It was a very stressful time to quit, and I probably wouldn’t have advised anyone in my shoes to do it, but I was determined to stop. I’m not advising anyone to stop taking Phenibut cold turkey—this is purely just to share my experience. 

I had some of the worst panic attacks of my life, but I’ve definitely had worse on hallucinogenic drugs. These were just drawn out without much relief around the 72 hour mark. That was the worst of it. As I mentioned in my original post, I went back to work on Day 4 and didn’t miss anymore work. It was difficult with the constant anxiety and heart pounding, but I managed with L-Theanine and Magnesium.

Started sleeping better the second week, which really helped a lot. Still had low-level, alternating anxiety and depression throughout days 7-14, but it was easy to hide at work or around friends. The third week, I noticed a massive drop in anxiety/depression. Even while the world is in a crisis and my hours have been cut significantly, I have been happier and less anxious than I have been the last several months I was on phen. 

I made a conscious decision to stop comparing my timeline and symptoms to others around the 2 week mark and to just try and avoid searching it and focusing on my own recovery. That has helped a lot. I really just wanted to check in today for anyone in the situation I was in at the beginning of the month. It does get better, and all my symptoms have improved—including libido. 

I’m now in week 4, and I’ve noticed a significant increase in appetite, but that may be due to not being able to work as much right now. I sleep through the night now and don’t wake up sweating or anxious. Ive worked out everyday since day 7. My gym closed indefinitely about a week ago, so I bought a bench and weights to use at home. I’ve started to enjoy a cup of coffee or two in the morning this past week, and I’m fine with baby hits of marijuana. Other than that, I’m staying away from anything GABA related. I don’t have cravings for Phenibut, but I occasionally will have cravings for alcohol. I think that’s about it. I know this is a scary time, and I’m hoping a more positive post will potentially help others going through it right now.",8

Im freaked out about Covid-19, and don't want to wind up in a hospital on a ventilator with a raging Phenibut addiction, especially if they're triaging...so ive decided its time to quit.

Ive been be taking 10-20 grams a day (i know....its a ridiculous amount...im a drug addict....) for 5 or 6 months.

I have probably 700 grams left, but don't really foresee nor want to order more.  Id like to get off ASAP, and am considering trying to quit with the help of other meds, which ive been stockpiling.

Im prescribed a large amount of Gabapentin, but my tolerance is high, as i take that daily, so i don't know how helpful that will be.  I have been some extra, but doubt be out be too helpful

Im also prescribed Valiumt.  Im prescribed 5 mg a day and probably have 100 extra mg.  I take it only at night, and don't take it every night (granted i take it most nights)

I also have probably 40 25mg Librium.

Lastly i have about 4 months of Baclofen at 30mg a day (so maybe...400 10 mg tablets give or take) and pick up another 90 this week

How feasible is a cold turkey detox with the help of these Meds, and how ""obvious"" will my withdrawal be?  Im currently quarantined with family, and am hoping not to have to tell them about the Phenibut.  My excuse will Probably be that im trying to cut out the Gabapentin or reduce the Valium, so some withdrawal symptoms will be  acceptable, but a sweaty, super shaky, psychotic mess would be hard to explain.  I may just have to tell them the next truth that im withdrawing from phenibut.

Also, and kind of advice on the amount of Baclofen to take would be appreciated, and if i have enough, plus a timeline.  Once withdrawn, I'll continue to receive the Valium/Gaba/Baclofen prescriptions.


I also need think i have a handful of be seroquel somewhere, but don't know how helpful that'll be be, other c than for sleep the first few day

If i began taking etizolam for maximum of 2 weeks and only dose before bed for sleep since out of experience sleep is the key to not have a intensified state of pure anxiety sense of doom and dead ass depression from the withdrawal of phenibut. Plan is to c/t phenibut wait until the 3rd day to see just how intense the withdrawal and sense of doom is. From that point I'll justify the dosage of etizolam I need by starting with .5mg of etizest-1 etizolam increasing dosage to a desirable state of relaxation ideal just enough to drift asleep while chucking a 10mg xr melitonin along with it. If i happen to reawake I'll find the lowest dosage of etizolam to drift back asleep. Depending how severe morning depression may supplement with 100mg-200mg caffeine to l-theanine see how successful that is at combating the low mood feeling of dread and sad state of mind. Ideally I would leave out the caffeine but I could only get l-theanine in combination with caffeine at the time. Ideally I would like to avoid using etizolam anytime other than at night. But for the sake of not having a siezure, if I feel totally shook or entirely overwhelmed only then will I supplement with etizolam only if absolutely needed. My theory here is since I'm not stimulating gaba-b receptors, they can in theory heal while the anxiety is kept at bay with the minimal dosage effective of gaba-a etizolam to alleviate withdrawal symptoms of phenibut. Ideally using the gaba-a etizolam only to get forced sleep with melatonin to increase rem sleep which  should by just getting rem sleep alone while withdrawaling from phenibut should help daily anxiety immensely. Insomnia state on phenibut withdrawal increased daily anxiety for me 10 fold. I've got a pretty good feeling about this. That's all. Just a feeling.

I realize the actions that got me here are incredibly stupid. But I hope in sharing them, it might help someone else just getting introduced.

When I first started, it was only a few times a week at a small dose just to help to sleep. It seemed to knock me out everytime then. But it became a nightly routine, then I discovered how much it improved my performance at work, at social interactions, paradoxical to it being a sedative it seemed to give me energy unless I overdid it. 

Over the next few months it stabilized at around 3-4gpd. Then, after a series of very traumatic family events and work deadlines it shot up to around 6gpd.

Around this time I also started drinking every night. So the alcohol was putting me to sleep instead, but the phenibut (or my most recent dose wearing off) was now waking me up. I tried to quit drinking but this only shot my phenibut use up to 10gpd just to not feel miserable. And it seemed like I couldn't take enough to fall asleep. So I would end up drinking again.

For the past few weeks I would be getting 2 hours of sleep on average or 4 at most. My mental health was failing and I started having terrible anxiety and irritability. Last week I got disowned from my family (having came out as gay a couple months ago) and I went on a heavy binder that left me non-functional and peaked me at 15g+ that day. Running out of alcohol that day sent me into a panic attack and taking more phenibut only seemed to give me more anxiety.

My partner helped me get stable. I called an uber and had him take me to the hospital telling them I needed an alcohol and phenibut detox. I struggled to explain what phenibut was to them, but they didn't seem to care since alcohol withdrawals are an established concern. I lied and said I had been drinking heavily for 1 year instead of 3 months.

I was on the hospital bed for around 12-hours and it ranged from numb/passing-out to excruciating. They said they needed to see how bas it was going to get before they could give me a benzo. Eventually I had a panic attack and they administered Librium. They transported me to at a detox facility that afternoon.

The detox facility was very interested in the phenibut component. The doctor researched it and administered 3x10mg Baclofen daily along with Ativan titrated down. After 72 hours I left AMA because of an emergency with my partner.

But i's been two days since I discharged. 2 panic attacks yesterday and none today. No baclofen, just vaping and CBD bud to get me through. I tried l-theanine but it seemed to make me more anxious. Currently I experience waves of anxiety, sweats and chills, restlessness and mild depression - but it's all manageable. I still havent been able to sleep since discharge but I'm hoping tonight's the night.

I'm hopeful each day will get a little better. My employer understands the situation and has given me time off work. After this normalizes I'm getting into addiction resources.

I don't know what I would have done if I weren't able to get into that detox program and I'm thankful to have had the insurance for that.

When I first started, I read a lot of the stories on this subreddit, and couldn't imagine how I would ever let myself get up to 8, 10 or even 15g. But it all happened so fast. And combining it with alcohol seemed to turn it into a relay race. Hope others dont make my mistakes, or use phen as the only means to fall asleep.

Thanks for reading my rant. It wasnt a real cold turkey but I feel like I'm halfway through, and if anyone has any suggestions I appreciate any advice.",8

2020-03-18 22:17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fl23wj/almost_died_today/,Almost died today,"I was going through phenibut withdrawals from 1.5g a day. I heard gabapentin makes the withdrawals practically go way, well, it didn’t. Instead it made it much much worse 

I had no choice, but to call an ambulance. I was losing my shit. At first I kept debating if it was a good idea, but I decided it’s what I needed to do. When the ambulance got there they asked me what I took, and when I told him this fat old dick goes “WHY ARE YOU TAKING PILLS THAT ARENT PRESCRIBED TO YOU?”. I told him I just need medical help 

When I get to the hospital they spend 2 hours figuring out what phenibut is while I’m freaking the fuck out in psychosis. My heart rate and my blood pressure were both dangerously high. They were trying to give me Ativan, but I denied it for some reason, instead I was waiting for a friend to bring me phenibut. Unfortunately they weren’t allowing visitors because of the coronavirus. Half of the staff talked to me like I was some useless junkie, but this one nurse kept comparing me to her son and she was like my guardian angel 

When my piss test came back they found I had extremely low potassium levels, “fatally low” potassium levels. They gave me IV potassium and a potassium supplement, they said I would’ve died without the potassium, so it was a good thing I came. I have no idea why my potassium was so low, but I got prescribed potassium supplements for a few days. Once I got the potassium I tell them I want to leave, but the doctor goes on for 5mins about how it’s dangerous for me to leave and I need to stay over night. She told me I could have a seizure and by then it would be too late, but at the hospital they could treat me. All I could think was “fuck this stupid ass hospital bill, I need phenibut”, and what I said was “I can’t deal with any higher of a hospital bill and I’m taking phenibut to get this over with”. After her 5-10min lecture I just said “I still wanna leave”. 

My hero of a best friend swooped in to save rhe day, and I took my phenibut dose and he watched me till it kicked in to make sure I was okay. I was tweaking out pretty bad for a few hours, but I ended up coming back to reality after a few hours.

About a year ago I decided I wanted to stop. I started to taper 100 pd and got crippling depression and anxiety. Then I just set up a rule for myself where I had to always take less every day no matter what the amount. So some days I would cut it down by 20mg but if i was feeling anxiety I would only cut it down by 5mg. This went on for a long time. Over christmas I basically reduced it by 5 or less mg a day because I was too stressed to deal with WD symptoms. 

I have had an issue with anxiety all my life so I figured I should address that in whatever ways I could while I worked to get off phenibut, so I started using L Theanine and Mucuna pruriens and 5-HTP to help with mild anxiety, started doing daily yoga and using the gym at work to do some running and biking and started mindfulness meditation and getting enough sleep.

Then at 900mg I started to cut it by 20mg per day but holding it at the weekend, so 100mg per week.

The withdrawal effects were minimal and 2 days ago, I stopped at 20mg.

I was expecting at least some withdrawal but I actually feel great. 

Before I started taking phenibut I was smoking weed pretty much every day. Which I honestly think was the cause of my anxiety disorder. So now I feel better than I have for as long as I can remember. 

There is no chance I will ever start taking phenibut on a daily basis ever again. It was a mostly unpleasant roller coaster ride where I didn't feel like my emotions were dependent on the situation but rather on how much phenibut was in my system. 

So if you have enough to last a while, then I recommend doing a slow taper, don't rush it, it will be over eventually.",12

So, I went with ND to get 250mg capsules in order to better track my dose and keep it steady. Once the opiate withdrawal was done, I was/am going to start tapering my Phenibut dose. 

While withdrawing, I began to notice something was off. I couldn’t figure it out. I was having tremors in my
hand, anxiety/depression absolutely through the roof and no sleep at all. Something was off. I tried to then taper my opiate dose a bit because these symptoms were just absolutely unbearable. Tapering opiates brought little relief. After a week or so..I began questioning if it was my new vendor choice for Phenibut. Low and behold- I go back to my LM crystals and bam, instant relief today at the same dose of the ND crystals I was using. 

So I withdrew from Phenibut and opiates all at once. I’m now back on LM Phenibut because I need to function for work and will start tapering it down.

On this occasion though I feel the need to share this for anyone struggling with shaking Phenibut. I am 6 days clean from a 4 month long 5g a day habit, and I pretty much feel like my old self again already, having feared several weeks if not months of severe anxiety and depression (as most of the horror stories on here would have you believe).

What has made this possible is Fasoracetam. I have no way of proving that i'm not a nootropics vendor trying to pedal the product but I really urge you to try this if you want to quit because it has helped get out of a pretty dark place. All i can do is pass this info on.

I took 30mg Faso every night on my last week of phen because I had read that it needs a few days to come into effect. I took my last phen dose on the Saturday after I left work and from there I took Faso 3 times a day at 30mg sublingually. For the first four days I had very bad insomnia not sleeping a wink the whole time, but on the fourth day a pot of Valerian Root tea and a large glass of wine sent me right to bed. After that no trouble sleeping thus far. I also had the classic phen withdrawal symptoms in the morning before my faso dose for the first four days. They served as a scary reminder of what it could've been like. 

The effect of the Faso is very subtle but you can notice it at higher doses, the best way to describe it would be a feeling of emotional stability. It has anxiolytic and anti depressant qualities. But again, don't expect wonders, it is subtle, enough for you to feel normal and functional.

I tried a few vendors over the course of a couple of months (at first attempting to lower my phen tolerance). They were: MondailK, Intellimeds, and Nootropics Depot. Nootropics didnt seem to have as much of an effect as the first two, with mondailk being my favourite. Sorry non EU people, might be a bit more expensive.

So I hope some of you give this a try and it works out. This was possible because I left my job and have free time at home. If you need to, book yourself a week away somewhere, tell everyone its a hiking trip or something. Make some excuse, and just go. Doesn't matter what it costs or what money you miss out on making, you need to break this habit eventually and you cant put a price on your mental health. Good luck!

I’m at around 4-8 grams per day depending on how I’m feeling. When I run out of either I feel absolutely terrible. Mentally and physically. Phenibut is worse and I’ve tried to taper knowing the consequences but I fear I will end up in the depressive anxious state I was in before I found phenibut.  The two out masks on my emotions and let me live my daily work life to the max. When I’m off it’s like I’m not myself anymore. How do you guys find the strength to actually get off of it?,2
2020-03-09 11:40:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ffwjjy/phenibut_and_seroquel_quetiapine/,Phenibut and seroquel (quetiapine),"So I've been posting a lot lately about this terrible ""vibrating"" sensation I've been experiencing as a result of phenibut. To give a short description, it basically feels like there is this sort of shaking sensation going on inside my body. I'm not actually externally shaking, though, it's just an internal sensation. Initially, it would happen around 12 hours after dosing phenibut and would go away with my next dose, but after a while, it started happening earlier and earlier until eventually, it wouldn't go away no matter what.

I managed to get it to go away for a while by splitting my dose into 2, but after a while, that too stopped working, and now I am once again back to feeling these horrible ""vibrations"" 24/7. Some people theorized that it was a result of tapering too fast, but it definitely is not. Besides the fact that I started feeling like this before I even started tapering, I raised my dose by a gram about 5 days ago just to make sure, keeping my dose there in case I needed to ""stabilize"" and, sure enough, the vibrating sensation didn't go away. I'm pretty sure it has something to do with glutamate surges or something like that, as others have speculated on my posts.

The sensation started getting really bad about a month ago. Now, maybe 1 1/2-2 months ago, I started taking 75mg of seroquel nightly to sleep. I'm starting to wonder if seroquel is interacting with phenibut to cause this sensation. Has anyone else taken seroquel while addicted to high doses of phenibut and experienced anything similar? I'm going to stop taking seroquel for a while and see if it does anything to help. 

Of course, any other suggestions related to the vibrating feeling would be very greatly appreciated. This is probably my 5th or 6th post about it in the past couple weeks, but it's seriously just so unbearable to me. It's not even a super strong sensation, but something about just how constant and inescapable it is is just so difficult for me to deal with. I'm really just looking for any relief from this.",2

I started using Phenibut around this time last year to help ease the anxiety from Suboxone WD’s. I started using these shots from the gas station called Sleep Walkers which allegedly contain around a gram each plus caffeine and God knows what else. I used them daily for 3 months, then switched to hcl powder. I regrettably didn’t keep track of my tolerance building, and I realized I had worked my way up to 3.5gs once I bought a scale. I have spent the last six months tapering down to 1.5g. I made a lot of great strides with confidence, bodybuilding, and relationships, but it was beginning to turn on me. 

During the last month or two, I noticed I could not consistently stabilize on that dose, and it’s been causing issues like terrible rebound anxiety—including performance anxiety in the bedroom. I told my partner last week about my use, and it took a lot of weight off my shoulders, and I knew it was time to stop. It seemed like no matter what dosage I took of phen, I’d still get the same symptoms within a few hours. 

I picked an incredibly stressful time to quit. My grandmother, that I was really close to before Alzheimer’s gradually took her from me, passed a day after I told my partner. He allowed me to continue using it until her funeral was over. My last dose was 1.5g on Sunday. I also had to be trained on new shit at work by higher ups this week. I will do a full experience report on the last 5 days if anyone wants that. Day 3 was the absolute worst, and I simply could not go to work. I’ve used Valerian Root, l-theanine, and magnesium/calcium/zinc supplements to cope. Melatonin for shitty sleep lol.

I’m on Day 6 currently. I’ve noticed my anxiety is worse when I’m alone/not pre-occupied and during the morning, but it’s manageable. This may have to do with obsessively researching timelines and symptoms, but it’s easier to suppress. I’m continuing to take L-Theanine and Magensium, but I haven’t taken any Valerian today. I woke up with a boner that lasted at least 15-20 minutes, but I had no interest in trying to orgasm. This is my most troubling symptom at the moment, along with not having much of an interest in anything I know I usually enjoy. 

I am determined to never go through a week like this one ever again, and I’ll never touch another dependency-forming substance EVER again. I have learned my lesson, and I’m done fucking with my brain chemistry. I’ve been dependent on something with sedative properties for 5 years (opiates, suboxone, then Phenibut). My concentration now is only on healing what I’ve done. Is there anyone that could shed some light on how much longer I have for the anhedonia and moderate anxiety to subside or supplements/actions I could take to heal my GABA receptors naturally? I don’t think I have erectile dysfunction issues given I’ve been getting erections, but I don’t have any interest at all and that keeps giving me anxiety. I know healing time varies by person and it’s only been 6 days, but any info would help.",2

Since the accident tough, I have anxiety, and I haven’t been able to finish any task without it taking weeks. 

I was on adderall and it helped a lot.  I can’t afford it with my new insurance.

Given your struggles, would you take phenibut in low dose to manage symptoms?  Or is this too risky?

I ask simply because some people have problems with weed, while others function on it perfectly well.  I don’t know hardly anything about phenibut.

I do have prescriptions for gabapentin, and baclofen.",3

The last 2 years I’ve been taking 2-4 sleepwalker pills a day, I’ve weened down to 1 pill at times and had low energy but was able to push through with excessive caffeine, but have always managed to get back to 2-4 pills a day. 

Now for about the last 6 months straight I’ve taken 3-4 sleepwalker capsules daily, 2 in the morning 1 at night and I’ve never really had an issue (besides making sure I always had them) 

I recently got promoted to a different location and sleepwalker is impossible to find here and excessively expensive online, so I toyed with quitting. I can sustain 2 in the morning 1 at night and have almost no mood fluctuations ever and that’s why it’s so easy for me to continue use. 

I’ve tried to just not take anything a day or two and halfway through the day I slowly start having excessive anxiety (obviously the phen) 

I haven’t ever had an issue with not having it as it’s extremely cheap and where I previously lived had it at every gas station, now that I’m considering quitting while taking on a new role at work that’s performance based I figured I’d reach out because I have no idea the level of phen I’m taking and usually if I just slowly stop taking it I can manage until the next day when I can take more, and or get the liquid shots and slowly take less and less. BUT yet have I completely stopped in the last 2 years. 

I am a recovering addict of opiates and know I have a dependence, but providing for my family is important and rehabilitation isn’t an option. Any input besides anxiety treatment would be amazing! 

P.s I also take kratom from time to time, but no more than a couple grams a day, and never more than a day or two in a row and haven’t ever really noticed a dependence on it and usually get sick of it and want to stop taking it due to it making me lethargic.",6

With other drugs at least you know where you stand and no matter your biochemistry you can always relieve the symptoms by simply re-dosing. But this... so called ""supplement"" can apparently be much worse for you than certain illegal hard drugs.

I first found phenibut 4.5 years ago , didn’t read any warnings just positive reviews. So I got some and my use the first 6 months went up to like 7g. I never meant for it to be daily but after the first time of 2-3g it was enjoyable and also felt a nasty feeling the next day. I realized I needed to taper because in between doses and at night I’d get weird nasty feelings. 

So I got down to about 1g/day pretty slowly but easily. Felt better on less too. I took 500mg in the am and 500mg in the pm for the next 3+ years. 

Recently I took time off and quit a moderate long term kratom habit , also cutting back phenibut to around 6-700mg a day, which is where I’m at now.

My options are: maintain this dose for a bit as my body still  adjusts to being kratom free, slowly taper.

Get baclofen and taper.

I barely notice any effect from phenibut anymore. I was on gabapentin high dose for over  10 years and it wasn’t too bad to quit for me( quit that 5 years ago), so I’m hoping this won’t be that bad.  However, I’ve never gone a day without it in the 4.5 years so I’m sure it could be bad.",2

So here’s my Phenibut journey in brief. I started taking it back in October and DID NOT measure out how much I was taking. After 2 wild months, I looked into the stuff further and saw how AWFUL withdrawal effects were. So I cut back and cut out Phenibut by New Years. I went through about 2-3 weeks of mental hell but eventually the withdrawals went away and I was in the clear. Hooray.

Except for not because a few weeks later (late January/early February) I decided to try to use it responsibly which, of course, did not pan out. Now, I never got my dosage that high (1.25gpd) but still, trying to cut it out this time is soooo much worse. This is partially do to the fact that I’m bipolar type I and still had some manic energy in January. Now that I’m fully out of mania and DEEP into depression, the rebound it hell.

I’m down to .2gpd but I’m struggling almost every moment because of how alone I am. I know that my body/mind WILL recover shortly (drastically cut back from 1.25gpd initially with the help of gabapentin) but I fear these next few days/weeks while I level off and cut the damn stuff out completely. Can anyone offer any advice/sympathy? Thx",5
2020-03-02 16:46:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fcjmm9/question_about_agmatine/,Question about agmatine,"Hi guys,

I got my agmatine in the mail today, I'm hoping it will help with some of the glutamate related side effects of high dose phenibut (being able to taper faster is obviously another plus).

I take phenibut 2 times a day, 7-8 hours apart. Currently taking 8.6g total (2x4.3g) and tapering down 100mg/day.

My question is, if I already took my first dose, can I still take agmatine with my second dose 7 or 8 hours later? (I know this isn't phenibut related, but I'm wondering the same thing about kratom, too, since I take kratom every 4 hours). Otherwise, should I just wait until tomorrow to take it before I dose?

Also, I've heard that you're supposed to cut your dose down a lot with agmatine. I'm honestly way too afraid to do that, since the last time I messed up my dose for just one day, I was in withdrawals for almost a week before I stabilized again. So, my question there is, if I don't reduce my dose (or maybe only reduce it by, say, 200mg) will that give me any negative side effects, or will it just make the phenibut stronger?

Also, if there's anything else I should know about agmatine in general, please let me know.

Thank you!",1

I’m not sure that even if I don’t feel bad in still not causing damage,So I’ve been tapering from 6.5 GPD at anywhere from 100-200mg per day as my scale only reads down to .1 grams. Since feb 20th I’ve gone from 6.5 to 5.5 gpd today on March 1st and Ive really only felt minor anxiety at points. I’m honestly down to continue dropping 200mg per day as long as I can handle it but I’m worried thus might be too fast and might have the potential to cause harm. I’m 20 years old and I’m thinking that might effect my ability to taper quickly as drug withdrawal has been found to be easier for young people. Let me know what you guys think though. I’m truly hoping that I might be able to keep that up but I’m assuming I’ll most likely have to slow it down as I approach 3 GPD and under. I’m going to Spain in late April and if I can go there with my habit somewhere around 2GPD that will make my life far easier as I can just pack some capsules vs having to bring a MG scale and a jar of phenibut and risk having customs or the TSA confiscate it. If that happened I’m not sure what I’d do honestly. I don’t want to even imagine that situation. Being stuck in a foreign country with no access to phenibut. It would be easier to be addicted to heroin in rhag situation as I could probably go to a sketchy area and ask around. With phenibut the only way to access it is online and there are no Europe based vendors so I’d have to check myself into a foreign ER for a week,1

On Thursday, I felt super shitty, with a lot of anxiety, insomnia, vasoconstriction, etc. On Friday, it got worse, same symptoms mostly. I felt weird mentally, but it's hard to describe. My arms and legs have also been feeling kind of weird, almost like the skin is irritated. On Saturday, I started feeling a little bit better, mostly the same symptoms. I had a slight auditory hallucination, and a couple of visual ones, if you want to call it a hallucination. It was more like some things just looked slightly distorted. And I've now just woken up Sunday morning feeling fine so far. Or at least relatively fine. Better, but I guess we'll see if I continue to feel better throughout the day.

But anyway, I'm just wondering how much gabapentin I should be taking, and also when I can expect to start getting off of that. During the day, I've been taking 400 mg, two or three times. Then at night taking a total of around 3200 mg. I'm going to start lowering the night dosage but 400 mg a day, or maybe every couple days. 

I'd really appreciate any advice about things you guys have found to help and any experience with gabapentin.

Edit: oh yeah, I've been on phenibut for ~ 2 years.",2

If all goes well then I’ll be discharged tomorrow and then continue to do a Baclofen taper on my own time. 

Obviously talk to a doctor but Baclofen is most likely saving me from some pretty bad symptoms right now and I’ve heard that it’s much easier to taper. 

Good luck to you all",11
2020-03-01 06:53:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fbt1gd/detox_update_day_3/,Detox Update: Day 3,"I should mention that this is really only my second full day of completely no phenibut. Last night I didn’t sleep at all, took my Trazadone at 10pm and woke up at 12am thinking I had just slept 8 hours. Unfortunately I didn’t and now I’m wide awake due to restless legs and my morning cup of glutamate. I even had to call a nurse to see if I could get my Baclofen sooner which he really helped me out and called a single order from the doc. 

Yesterday I certainly had fairly awful points of withdrawals where “primal fear” would kick in but the Baclofen and people here are really helpful. The worst part of withdrawals for me is the feeling that I am going to be stuck like this, even though I know that it will pass in a few weeks, also the sleep. 

I’m really worried that lack of sleep will compound the effects of withdrawal and send me into psychosis or whatever. I also woke up starving this morning, so hungry it feels like I have to puke? Unfortunately, the kitchen isn’t open until 7. 

Fuck my life, I hate phenibut.

Edit: I have solid poops now! No more diarrhea or constipation. So I guess that is a positive that I am seeing now. I also don’t feel poisoned anymore, even if phenibut isn’t poison, it always felt like I was eating a synthetic drug. 

I will also leave another afternoon or evening update mainly for the sake of my mental health but also for others who are needing some real-time advice. Feel free to dm me and ask more.",9
