First of all, I am so glad to have found this community; the positive posts and tapering information have inspired me to do my own taper and quit! I have taking it everyday for the past 4 months (between 3gpd and 4gpd depending on the day). I got a digital scale and started my taper last week, today is my first day of 1.75 grams and I am going to hold here for the next 3 days before dropping to 1.5.

I have been taking l theanine, NAC, and lemon balm at night and have been getting great sleep. I definitely feel a bit more lethargic and less outgoing/social, but I've been working out and forcing myself to stay busy to keep my mind out of a dark place.

I have seen many times in this community that agmatine sulfate helps tremendously during tapering/quitting and my order just arrived today! So my question is this: how am I supposed to use the agmatine sulfate effectively? Do I take it before, with, or after my tapered dose? Should I make an even bigger jump with my taper since I will be using agmatine? What milligram/gram dosage should I use and how many times per day?

Thank you so much for all of your input in advance, all of you have motivated me to kick this, and I know we all can do this!",5,0

I found myself in the gas station recently and saw one of the more popular phenibut-containing energy shots on the shelf and reminded myself how they had taken the ingredient out and it was just a caffeine and nootropic blend now. Lo and behold, I grabbed the bottle and read the ingredient list and was surprised to see it was back stock that still contained phenibut. I took one, and surmising that these only contained about a gram of phenibut and my expectations were not high but considering a month and a half had passed I began to realize the magic was back; I felt in control, focused, relaxed, mildly euphoric. It reminded me how I loved the feeling of phenibut back before it became a routine that I didn't even notice anymore.

My question is, I ordered phenibut capsules that arrived today and am super tempted to dose again tomorrow but it has only been two days since last ingestion and I am aware that I got off lucky this past time and that kindling is a thing; has anyone managed to quit a daily habit and keep their usage in check to at most once or twice a week upon continuing? I know I am playing with fire, and to not let it become a daily habit again, and also to obviously not let myself reach my high level dosages again. Any constructive input or experiences would be appreciated. Cheers!",7,0

I have been on it for well over a year and a half, possibly even nearing 2 years. In the beginning I was taking lower doses but then quickly went up to very high doses, I mean I went from 1gpd to 7-10gpd within 2 months, and for the past 4 months I've come down from 4-6gpd to now 1-1.5gpd, I work a full time job as a construction manager for a prevalent building company that involves A LOT of hands on hard labor along with A LOT of mental stress. That is mainly part of the reason I have put off quitting phen for longer than I have. A little information about me, I am 27 about 160lbs, very fast metabolism and a very long history of poly drug abuse. I am currently prescribed 8mg x 2/daily of suboxone, as well as 2mg x 3/daily of klonopin and 30mg x2/daily of adderall. Yes I know that is A LOT of shit to be putting into my body. Although I am prescribed those amounts I usually only take about 2mg/daily of suboxone and maybe 2mg/daily of klonopin and unfortunately all 60mg/daily of the adderall. I have a shitty Dr. who will damn near prescribe me anything I ask for as long as it is not an opiate like oxy's or morphine etc. but if you couldn't tell by the amount of other stuff I am prescribed he could give a shit less about my actual well being.. And I know that is not a good thing, but in this case it may be. 

I'm looking to completely be off of phen within the next month and can go see him anytime I want, I need to know what the best way is to go about getting off the most comfortable way possible so i'm still able to work full time, and still able to function at home. I've read quite a bit on this forum and have a general idea as far as medications go and timelines go.. But i'd like somebody who has quit and is still clean from phen to tell me what they did, and what they suggest doing. And also anybody else to tell me what to expect mentally after I have completely gotten off.

ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING APPRECIATED I AM DESPERATE TO GET OFF THIS SHIT!",4,0

I’ve tried to quit many times in the past but I could never work while withdrawling.

Edit: My gut is completely fucked. Sometimes I wake up with lower back pain and some pain in my abs but not always. I also get vocals ticks when i have tried tapering in the past. Started drinking Vitamin B12, D3, Probiotic (probiotic recommendations would be appreciated) and magnesium",5,0

I feel super proud of myself but of course am still recovering but I’ve discovered a few things that have helped me a ton. What has helped me the most so far is taking and iodine supplement along with magnesium, a antioxidant blend including NAC and l theanine. The iodine has done so much for me since adding it to my normal stack and the thyroid support has really given me a boost hormonally. The phenibut definitely messed with my hormones and put them way out of whack. I’m not sure if it will work for everyone but it could definitely be worth a try because I read somewhere that most Americans are iodine defecient anyways and coming off a substance that interacts with your hormones could leave you super messed up.

I started taking phenibut because I was looking for VGCC after I took some gabapentin and couldn’t be bothered to find a doctor.

Found it, bought it, loved it. You know the drill.

Straight manic for months on end, was pretty tight. Until suddenly it wasn’t. I felt like ass, no matter how much I took (15gpd at the end?) it just didn’t do anything except make me dizzy and make me shit violently. The anxiety, in retrospect, was insane. I can only imagine how many people have experienced that without either a) dying immediately afterwards or b) miraculously surviving. 

I’ve had panic attacks in the past before anything but the phenibut panic attacks are on a different planet. Well for the first few times at least. Just like my regular old panic attacks they just became part of life. I’d describe the phenibut panic and a white hot panic, it’s like being immerse in a pool of primal fear. I would just excuse myself to the bathroom and calm down. 

I got used to it, as much as you can. I stopped coming here and reading horror stories. I went to a psych, told him what was up. He prescribed me Valium. I told him sure but I’d rather have gabapentin. He gave me both. Didn’t really take the Valium, except on bad days and I kept a log, still have some left somewhere idk. I took like 2400mg gabapentin and it wasn’t like I was 100% but it was much more manageable. I continued on like that for like 3 months, tapered the gabapentin because I couldn’t remember anything at all. Morontin is definitely an appropriate name for the drug.

My advise to you then is don’t come here, you already know the news. It’s fucked. Find a doctor any doctor and just say you took this shit. They won’t know what it is, they’ll look it up and go “oh it works on gaba.” 

I know towards the end the only thing that got me to keep going was knowing that by the time I saw the doc I would have an exit plan. I just believed it and it worked. So make a plan, see a doctor, and don’t read horror stories.",8,0

I started taking phenibut in July of 2020. I took it daily to the point where 6 gpd didn’t do much for me. I had quit on and off several times, but the last dose I’ve had of Phenibut was July 13th of this year. The worst of the withdrawals are finally over, though I still may be experiencing some symptoms of PAWS, but it’s hard to tell. 

Anyways, on to the topic of my testosterone levels. Last time I got bloodwork done for my testosterone levels was in 2019, and my serum testosterone levels were well over 700 ng/dL. Which is pretty good. Definitely on the higher end. However, I got blood work done again on August 11th after explaining my concerns to my doctor about my low energy and especially low sex drive. I just picked up the results today expecting that my levels would be generally the same and maybe I was just imagining things, but it turns out that my serum testosterone was less than half of my previous results at 356 ng/dL. 

I’m honestly in shock rn. I know my levels are still technically in the “normal range”, but these levels aren’t normal for me. It explains a lot. Like why my workouts haven’t been as good as they used to be, why my sex drive has been almost nonexistent, or why it’s been harder to focus on anything. As soon as I can, I’m gonna call my doctor’s office to make an appointment to discuss what I should do. I’m really nervous. I really don’t want to take synthetic T if I don’t have to.

The reason I did not make a slow taper this time is that it never works for me. It´s like pulling out a stick REALLY slow, or fast in my case, suits me better. 

I feel no depression or any other discomfort yet. Just really tired all the time that comes from Lorazepam. Right now there is no need for me to take my zopiclone/sleeping medicine that I have been described for six years.

If you can, get  Ativan from your doctor give it a try.

Thought I was being so careful but now I don't trust any of my knowledge.

I'm sure I'll feel 100% here in 4 days but I'm dealing with some mild transient anxiety from time to time thats bothering me.


Ive been taking magnesium and agmatine to combat it I have some fasoracetam but will I be shooting my self in the foot if i try to relief my self with that stuff?

[I posted a couple of weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/p01pmf/very_confused_longtime_user_at_1g_down_from_13g/) when I started lowering my dose. After that post I had a really hard time continuing to drop under 1g. Zero energy or motivation, then a relapse where I took 4g. Spoke with my Dr. about it and thankfully he has actually encountered phenibut before and knew about using Baclofen etc. 

I don't know if this was the best way to do it but they had me increase my phenibut dose to 3g with 20mg baclofen each day. Did that for a week, then I just said I wanted to completely stop the phenibut instead of a slow, multi-week transfer to baclofen, so they allowed me to switch to 60mg per day and eliminate the phenibut entirely.

It has been four days now and I feel quite decent. I'm afraid 60mg is too much but, hey, I'm comfortable and now that I'm back at work and being a single parent again, this should be relatively easy to slowly titrate down from.

I need some advice though, from anyone with experience using baclofen like this. Should I take my dose all at once in the morning? Spread out through the day? With or without food? I've tried to research but found conflicting anecdotes.

I'm still taking the agmatine and fasoracetam and I imagine they're helping.

Anyway, the main thing is I just want people out there to have courage to get off this stuff. I spent over a year being so incredibly terrified of stopping phenibut. Now I just need to remain mindful and disciplined while I fully get off the baclofen.

This is my first time posting anything on reddit, Phenibut actually made do it since it's such a unique substance which offered me a different/better perspective on life.

I've started using Phenibut FAA since 10 days ago and it obliterated my anxiety and made me feel how I would be without the anxiety I have and general lack of confidence. As an example I usually feel a little bit of pressure and clouded head when a stranger passes by me, or in the subway when I'm face to face with someone I can't look them in the eyes due to being afraid. Same with approaching girls.

Now I could do this easily and I was feeling very confident and relaxed around them and I feel that it actually attracts people, even strangers to me lol. Another example is that I've nailed an interview confidence wise and I was very relaxed and coordinated. My social skills are improved and I feel much more outgoing and enjoy even a long walk alone during crowds of people, which I quite hated before.

The problem is with the dosage and the fact that I've taken it like 7-8 out of 10 days because I got too excited with this stuff. I've watched all the guides and I took the days off initially, but I got some pretty stressful events going around and I didn't keep the rule anymore. I wanted to quit 2 nights ago but during the night I woke up with a small panic attack after nightmares that have small visual continuation after waking up. Couldn't sleep anymore so I decided to take a small dose of Phenibut.

I haven't been addicted to anything in my life, so I'm sure I can slow it down and reset the way of taking this.

My dosage was around 1.4-1.5G of FAA but I usually split them during the day, taking around 700-800 in the morning on empty stomach with coffee, afterwards at around 4-5 PM another dose of 500-600 and a very small one before bed, maybe 200. Is that a wrong way of doing it? Should I take just one dose?

I've started tapering it off since yesterday when I lowered the dose from 1.5G to 1.2G, all quite ok and today from 1.2G I intend to finish the day with 1.1G total. I've taken 800mg in the morning and I'll get 300mg this evening so I can sleep ok.

Would you advise that I continue this with around -100mg per day or should I just stop cold turkey since I haven't taken very large doses and only for around 8 days? although almost all of them consecutive...

Once I finish with this is 1-2 times per week with let's say 1.3-1.4G reasonable? I've noticed that's my best dosage in which I feel ok.

I personally began using it to get off regular phenibut which successfully worked and I am now two weeks without it. I experimented with different ROAs and dosages with f-phenibut faa and I've found that snorting it has been the most useful way for me. Taking it orally only lasts an hour or two longer and its effects are significantly less pronounced compared to intranasal and sublingual. I personally don't like doing sublingual cuz I have polydipsia (causes extreme thirst) so it is very hard to let it absorb without needing to drink water and I dose 2-3 times a day. 

Currently I'm using 360mg-540mg a day and I used to use 1-1.5gpd of reg phenibut.I was planning on tapering off it but now I've decided to keep using it until I can find a better option for my anxiety as I've been waiting on a psychiatrist for about two months. I used phenibut to help me off kratom (20GPD) and didn't stop and I became dependent for multiple reasons. 

In addition to having mild aspergers, I experienced a nightmare situation and then also had to break the relationship with my parents in addition to a bunch of other bs that all gave me crippling depression. I can't stand not being productive/ making decent money and Im still in the midst of this overwhelming complicated situation and using f-phenibut has helped me tremendously with keeping my life bearable.

It doesn't directly help with my depression but when I use it while getting work done or socializing I feel a lot better. I should also mention snoritng kanna helps directly with depression a lot. There definitely are negatives to me using it everyday but I find them way better than kratom and reg phenibut. There is depression and depersonalization when it wears off but I think that's mostly due to my previous phenibut usage plus I would much rather be able to choose the times I am depressed and anxious. Other than that it's just hard to pee most the time and my sleep is pretty messed up but I've had insomnia since a kid. My tolerance has only slowly built up and the comedowns are nothing compared to stimulants or regular phenibut.

 I am only making this post cuz of the lack of people's experiences with it online and I thought this was some useful info, I will likely post something whenever I do decide to quit to show what the withdrawals are like if any.

this got taken off r/phenibt even tho Im not dependent, I just choose to keep using for its benefits.",5,0

Is this post acute withdrawal syndrome?","Hey guys, thanks to this board and the experiences shared, I managed to stay clear from phenibut for 80 days and I want to say thanks for hearing me out and all your advice so far!

What I currently experience is making me worried about possible irrecoverable damage I might have done to my brain, since I had a bad withdrawal syndrome from quitting a 6 months of 1-3 gpd phenibut habit to fast, back then in march. 

Could this be normal paws or am i experiencing symptoms of chronic nerve damage from a condition like MS or something? 

I'm trying to stay clear from any gaba-ergic drug as much as possible since 80 days, but slipped into alcohol for one night, which I regretted badly, since phenibut-like wd symptoms popped back up 2 days afterwards.

I have muscle twitches throughout the whole day in different parts of my body, mostly my chest, back, shoulders and arms. My arms and feet are tingling and feel numb repeatedly. My sleep pattern is still disrupted, I wake up every night, after 3-4 h and go back to sleep after an hour for another 3-4 h. 

Anhedonia and slight paranoia accompanied by super low heart rate and low blood pressure, which probably cause my almost constant dizziness, brain fog and headaches, are my worst enemies currently. This is so exhausting, I was hoping to live a normal life soon, but I feel like I'm doomed.

Is there any measurable timeline to assume in which I will be back to normal again?

46,2021-08-20 05:18:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/p81lvq/18_months_later/,18 Months Later,"Hey everyone, 

I've been lurking on this sub for the better part of two years grabbing as much advice and ideas that I could. 

I started taking Phenibut a little over 2 years ago, I was working a very stressful job and honestly wanted to numb myself. I was incredibly nieve, I never got much out of Phenibut, didn't do much for stress, didn't get me ""high"", just made me chatty and hungry. Because I wasn't getting what I wanted out of it I kept taking more and more everyday trying to get the desired effect. I did this until I was taking close to 13g and realized that it didn't do much for me and that I was in DEEP.

I knew it was dangerous to go cold turkey especially at the dose I was at. I had two options, go to detox or start a taper. I chose the ladder and the long slog began. I took advice from all your experiences about appropriate amounts to drop and began finding a manageable daily cut. It fluxuated a lot but I found dropping 40-50mg a day with one or two days to stabilize a week was moderately comfortable. Yes, I could have gone faster but I knew it was going to take months and months so I preferred to let it take a long time than to be a complete mess for six months or so.

I consider myself lucky in that I have little to no psychological draw to Phenibut which has made it relatively manageable to stick to this long, slow taper without messing up. But I was very aware of how physically dependent I became on this substance. 

I am now at 1g, and starting to feel significantly less dependent as I have been dropping 80-100mg every day for the last week with just mild anxiety. I am planning to push through this final stretch and be done with this hell by next weekend. It's been a long journey with a few months where I was just dropping 10-20mg a day, but it has been manageable and I am so ready to be done. 

What I learned about this experience is that Phenibut is nowhere near worth it, I traded being a bit more social for 6 months for almost a year and a half of struggle. I know this is not the way to get off for some people but I just wanted to share what has worked for me.

Here are the to things that helped me in this taper:

 I have used specific symptoms as indicators of when I needed to stabilize for a day or two. Specifically feeling highly paranoid during the day and when I'd have multiple nightmares at night. I found that even just a day worked wonders in recovering and preparing for the next push.

Drinking significantly less caffeine. After a few days of dropping doses more than one cup of coffee spiked my anxiety 10 fold. This may not be the case for everyone but definitely was for me.

Getting outside and walking was vital. Getting some sun almost cured any anxiety I was dealing with completely. I know just walking can be very boring so I picked up pokemon go which further motivated me to get outside.

In terms of supplements I can't really speak for anything completely. I tried beta-alanine, I could say it helped but only to the point where it was psychosomatic. I also did a gotu kola regiment for 2 weeks and I think I felt a bit more on top of things but once again not a huge difference for me. I took some regular vitamins as well, vitamin D, magnesium every other day, B12 and ate a good breakfast most days.",10,0

Since switching to baclofen I’ve been probably more depressed with my moods swinging all over the place. 

I’ve tapered down from 60 to 25mg baclofen over the past 5 weeks. Though now on top of the usual depression I have pretty severe anxiety/derealization.

For reference, I was prescribed Baclofen (250mg p/ day), split into individual doses of 25mg throughout the day. This protocol had been followed for over a year.

During the past two months, this disgustingly had risen to ~473mg p/ day (equivalent to ~47.3g Phenibut), attempting to balance the glutamate storms (which mimic withdrawal symptoms) and trying to stabilise at any dose and still be functional.

My doses previously were every two hours. This was reduced to every 1 hour 30 minutes, as it was the only method in ridding myself of these symptoms.

I’ve since increased the timeframe between doses by 5 minutes p/ dose whenever I felt I could handle it. I had managed to stabilise on a total dose of 473mg p/ day: 43 mg, every 1hr 45mins. However, I couldn’t reduce further.

I then introduced Diazepam, which has made it possible for me to heavily reduce the previous dose to ~35mg and reach a rate of every 2 hours.

This brings the total p/ day to 350mg, a 123mg decrease from the previous 473mg p/ day.

However, I cannot reduce this further without experiencing crippling withdrawals/glutamate surges.

This brings me to my next point; I’ve acquired  1kg of F-Phenibut, with possesses a longer half-life of ~5hrs, compared to Baclofen’s ~2hrs.

I’m looking for guidance on transitioning over to F-Phenibut, considering the dose of Baclofen I’m presently consuming p/ day.

According to multiple individual reports, F-Phenibut’s 5-6x stronger than Phenibut. However, I cannot find any references to how this equates to Baclofen. 

PsychonautWiki provides some guidance; however, I cannot distinguish the appropriate dose for the transition. See picture attached: 
https://i.imgur.com/3ST8HgQ.jpg

I need to take into consideration the dose that would be equal to my Baclofen consumption. The half-life/plasma levels are experienced at the 2hr mark when I re-dose and how this equates to F-Phenibut with its longer half-life but requiring larger doses.

If anyone has any expertise regarding these substances (GABA-B), I’d greatly appreciate some guidance on proceeding with this transition. 

As the last thing I’d want is to experience is seizures, or even perhaps death.",1,0

Like so many others, i knew the dangers of taking phenibut on a daily basis and was managing it very well, only taking ~1g once a week. I had just had a terrible experience from kratom withdrawals after only taking it for a month, and i should have known better to try phenibut. 

I mainly started taking phenibut to boost my confidence at work/ social situations. I used to have a lot of social anxiety which has decreased over the years. I was always the “funny man” , but once i started taking phenibut i became a fuckin stand up comic. Slowly but surely i started taking it more and more often, knowing in the back of my head it would fuck me over in the long run.

I’ve been doing a pretty fast taper, dropping 1 capsule (250mg) every 4 days. Im currently down to 1g a day which I’m very happy/ proud of.

I never got withdrawal symptoms during that time. I had some anxiety but it was only the baseline anxiety that I had before taking it.

Phenibut at a low dose of 400mg makes me feel relaxed and chilled but not dumb like the pregabalin did, which is one of the reasons I came off lyrica. With a new job working from home, I’m in a position where I can come off everything while being able to just relax and deal with symptoms in my flat. I was wondering what the withdrawals are like for people who have stuck to low doses then, if it‘s likely I’ll suffer too bad given I never had any withdrawals from lyrica or if I can expect it to be much worse even at a low dose of 400mg every couple of days - I’ve seen so many people talk about how getting off pregabalin was hell for them and wondered why I hadn’t experienced that, and mostly it seemed it was from people who had continually upped their dose.

So I had a bit of a bender (close to two weeks taking ~3 grams a night, and am wondering what I should do, or expect.","Up front I have no more left. There’s a small chance I could get more, but I’m going under the assumption that I can’t, for now. 

I’m kinda freaking myself out a little bit, I knew what I was doing was kinda dumb, but thought it’d be in a pretty harmless way, I’d take what I’d take, and be done with it. Last dose was Thursday evening. I noticed when I woke up yesterday (Saturday) I woke up in a bad mood, and never got out of it. Eventually went to sleep, waking up every hour, and so far today, the depressed feeling is worse, and anxiety is creeping in, which I do not handle very well. 

Am I overreacting to the random sensations I’m feeling, and shout be fine? Is it gonna suck slightly for a few days, but ultimately break soon? Is it gonna be bad, and last a few weeks? Any help/answers would be appreciated. I’m not new to detoxing, but am to this particular drug. 

Edit: also, if you have any suggestions on what I can do, or take, to alleviate any distress I may have, I’m all ears. Thanks

First time user (both for the forum and phenibut), long time lurker.

I won't spend too much time boring you all with details.

Today is *day 10* of continuous usage. My dosages range from *1.5--2.4gpd*. I stick to a pretty consistent schedule of waiting 24 hours before redosing. I use 300mg capsules. 

I know I am playing with fire. And I want to be free of this bondage. While the effects are absolutely wonderful, I am in treatment for substance abuse. I figured I could have my cake and eat it too by using Phenibut. And now I know I've opened Pandora's box. 

I have a few questions. 

**What should I expect?
Should I taper? 
Will the withdrawals be as horrific as I've read? 
**
This is my first binge on Phenibut, and I am a fairly large person (~250lbs).

I have with me a full script of Gabapentin and some doses of Etizolam. Will these help in mitigating potential withdrawal symptoms? 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to the responses.",2,0

For some background I have been pretty heavily addicted to phenibut for the better part of a year, at one point using up to 15 grams per day. I literally couldn't get anything to help me quit at all and it was to the point that even with a massive dose of phenibut I could not sleep more than 3 hours a night. I was sick of slowly losing my mind and performing poorly at work so I went to the doctor and told them I had severe insomnia and that I have previously taken trazodone for said insomnia. That wasn't a lie either I took it for about a year and a half previously and it is miraculous. Upon the first night I slept like a rock and didn't want to get up... something I haven't experienced in months. I have been reducing my dose by 600-900 mg per day and have yet to experience any adverse withdrawal symptoms whatsoever. In the past I couldn't drop 300 mg without feeling like I was going crazy. I have been getting fantastic sleep and feel absolutely fine. I'm down from 12 grams per day just 5 days ago to 7 grams today and I plan to continue to drop by these massive amounts. I know it's risky but I feel completely fine so far and I need to rid myself of this garbage. Trazodone is very easy to get a prescription for and I would recommend anyone trying to quit to give it a shot. Like others have said, stay away from otc sleep aids like diphenhydramine as they will basically plunge you into an unreal panic attack and make you feel completely horrible forcing you to take more phenibut just to try to sleep. Trazodone has been a life saver for me and I will never go near phenibut again. 

DISCLAIMER: Ido not recommend anyone taper as rapidly as I have. It was a huge risk on my part and I luckily have had 0 symptoms so far. This is likely not the case for everyone and it could very well be dangerous. I am simply trying to bring to everyone's attention what has been the most effective method for me to quit this substance. I have had extreme difficulty with tapering over the past year and trazodone has literally made it completely painless. I do recommend that this method be pursued if you are like me and have had no luck at all with other methods at your disposal. Pairing trazodone with a normal taper timeline could be what saves you from prolonging your addiction. I don't think that this will exactly replace baclofen as the most effective replacement but it very well could considering a lot of people are in a situation that they cannot get baclofen due to employment or some other circumstance, also trazodone is a very well tolerated drug that has relatively mild side effects compared to some other replacement drugs and it is very easy to get a prescription for it.",7,0

I used Phenibut in doses ranging from 250mg to 1750mg daily for 41 days. After the stuff turned on me and started making me feel like crap I was forced to rapid taper.

It is day 76 now from being off the Phenibut and I STILL feel like shit. Anxiety, depression, dissociation, inabaility to focus. Granted, I was heavily abusing Vyvanse along with the Phenibut (and had been abusing Adderall before that) so I am sure A LOT of what I am feeling is from that. It is just odd though because I am so anxious now that when I do take Adderall it just sends me into anxiety mode, I don't get anymore of the euphoria anymore. I don't know if that is just from tolerance though.

I was on Gabapentin for a bit but that did not help at all and coming off that stuff was so awful I literally ended up in the psych ward. Now I am on Klonopin. Benzos seem to be the only thing that have helped so far and even then not always. Sometimes they make me feel like shit.

I just don't know what to do. I keep obsessing over the Phenibut because all of this began with that. I have not felt normal since using that stuff even though I keep telling myself there is no way all of this can be from that. Any thoughts or advice? I am kind of desperate at this point. Everyday I just feel like I am mentally crippled. I have only been surviving by grinding through and browsing the Internet.

More than anything I kind of just want answers. Is is the Phenibut? The stimulant abuse? Both, most likely? I'm even wondering if at this point the Klonopin I have been taking (and I have been on benzos for 78 days now) is just making things worse.

Have I really ruined my life from Phenibut? Taking that crap was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life. Again though, I keep telling myself that all of this can't just be from the Phenibut. I do also have severe anxiety, depression and OCD by themselves so I wonder how much of this is just in my head? Everyday now is just constant anxiety, depression and dissociation. My OCD keeps telling me the Phenibut destroyed my brain and my only solution now is suicide.",6,0

I barely got my next jar in time and the withdrawals freaked me out so hard I jumped right back on for about 2 weeks. I had to order another, id try to taper then jump on and off even though the phenibut no longer worked.

I nodded off at work and almost got fired, I was getting into fights with my best friends who are with me, all sorts of shit. 

I decided to just stay at a stable dose and I stuck with that, about 2.5 though I didnt have a scale yet so I dont know what dose my brain was actually adjusted to.

I started taking my taper seriously over the course of the last month/month and a half. To me its all about seeing that number go down. Even if its 10mg, even 5mg, i needed that number to be smaller every single day. Sometimes id drop 100-300mg and wait a week, the last few days ive been dropping 50mg a day.

Today I hit 1.2gpd and I am so so happy and proud. This shits been a rollarcoaster and so far this has been painless which I didnt expect at all after all the huge drops I had to do because I almost ran out of pheni multiple times. Im in love with who I am when on phenibut but I feel like ive finally matured or something to a point where I know I have to be sober and work on myself that way if I even wanna come close to that person.

Even during this taper Ive been working towards improving myself, Ive been developing my art skills, ive been trying really hard at socializing without phenibut and I've been getting results and it feels so good to make connections that are meaningful unlike the fake connections i felt with everyone while high. Im going to take the GED test once my friend comes back to town and I have a computer to use. 

The only thing thats been worrying is how painless this taper has been. I keep expecting withdrawls like when I learned I was addicted by having a panic attack and having hallucinations like I took 5 grams of shrooms, or any of the huge drops I had to deal with. Maybe im just used to feeling like shit but I have felt normal enough or even good/hopeful/driven during this entire time. Idk maybe my brain was adjusted to a dos way lower than I thought and have just been staying on phenibut longer than I needed to. I guess I had forgot what normal actually felt like haha.

77,2021-08-10 02:34:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/p1jqgg/trying_to_quit/,Trying to quit,"Hello fellow quitters,

Recently, I have come to terms that I don't want to be on Phenibut everyday anymore. I am grateful for the experience, but I ended up abusing it and don't wish to pursue that kind of habit anymore.

I have been getting over a head cold this week at the same time that I am tapering. It has not been kind to my anxiety. The whole reason I started taking more phenibut was to help manage my anxiety. I have started therapy recently to get better help for that.

Some info:
I was taking anywhere between 1.5 gpd to 2.5 gpd. Last year I was only taking half or a third of this amount per day. I tried stopping daily use of phenibut back in 2019 and I had a few panic attacks I didn't realize were linked to my withdrawal. To stop the panic attacks I turned to taking 250mg a day, increased it to 500mg to 1g every now and then. I started taking more when Covid really struck in my town around March 2020. 

From there my use only grew. I used it to help me in group social settings, work, and even for exercising. It was great for my mood and the like.

This last Tuesday, out of nowhere, right before my cold kicked in, I had a bad anxiety attack full of intrusive thoughts that I couldn't put a pause on. The only way I thought in the moment was to take 2grams of phenibut. I did. Then reflected about how maybe I was withdrawaling slightly. Thank god for my family being there to support me. I got emotional over so many things. I will say I took modafinil that morning which I am prescribed but usually it doesnt make me overly anxious.

Currently I have tapered down from 2 grams to 1.5 grams. I plan to decrease to 1.25 then to 1, before getting back down to a manageable dose before stopping use. I was really going up to 2 or 2.5gpd because I was putting in 10 to 12 hour shifts and it helped me get through the exhaustion and fall asleep at home. Everyone was concerned about burnout and I think I did, kinda. I also think the burst in anxiety came from me not taking a break in a long time.

The goal here is to get off phenibut, but eventually try moderation at once or twice a week for my anxiety. I recognize the risk in that. 

I am all for help during this rough time. Sometimes the anxiety isn't there. Sometimes it's mildly debilitating, like a sense of impending doom of sorts. I resort to some supplements, running, or meditation/breathing exercises to calm me down. 

I have read through some posts here and you guys have been very helpful in my slow recovery. If some people can get off this stuff after doing 30 or 1000gpd, then I am sure I can handle this. Though it will not be easy. Any tips would be appreciated. Except going cold turkey. I take Kratom, Kava, and L theanine among other things.

Thank you.

TLDR: Tapering from 2.5 gpd to 1.5gpd now. Have bad anxiety in general, and it comes and goes while I try to taper. Want to get down to 250mg. But not sure how long I should taper down for and when to drop 250mg at a time or less.

82,2021-08-08 21:23:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/p0rdus/guide_to_tapering_with_capsules/,Guide to tapering with capsules,"I felt like being nice and posting this maybe someone can use the info. This only works with capsules that do not contain any fillers whether you buy them or make them yourself.

\#1: Empty a capsule into a container to keep powder in then weigh it. Remember this number because it's what you subtract later on to know the actual size of your doses. A capsule advertised to weigh 250mg or 500mg for example doesnt actually weigh that much, even with the weight of the capsule subtracted. In fact, most full capsules don't weigh the same or contain the advertised amount.

\#2: Put an empty bottle or container on the scale, then turn it on. It should read 0.00. This is what you put your dose in.

\#3: Put however many capsules that you take in it except for 1 capsule and put it on the scale.

\#4: Put the 1 capsule you left out of the container beside it on the scale. If it's 10 capsules and an empty capsule weighs 0.05, 10x0.05 is your capsule weight. Subtract it from the weight of the dose and this is how much you're actually taking.

\#5: Open the 1 capsule beside the container and carefully tap out some into your powder storage container, not the container with the dose in it of course. You have to get the feel for it, but you're trying to dump out the amount that you're tapering the dose by. If your dose is 2.5g and you're reducing by 30mg that day, tap out a tiny bit and put it back on the scale beside the bottle that has the rest of the capsules in it. The total weight should be a little bit less, hopefully not below your target amount. If you dumped too much, store that capsule and try it again with another one. Believe it or not you'll get the hang of this pretty quickly.

This is just an example because you'll find that your dose of 10 capsules doesn't weigh what you assumed it did, it'll weigh more. It can be a shock to discover you're taking more than you thought but you'll move on. Also, your dose of 10 capsules will vary in weight each time you put 10 random capsules in the bottle to weigh it. This is why you're opening the last capsule and tapping however much out; to get the total weight of your dose close to exact every time, as well as giving you the liberty to reduce by as little of an amount as you'd like instead of taking 1 whole capsule less when you taper, which might be too much and giving you withdrawal symptoms.

\#6: When you've got it at the weight you prefer, put the capsule that you tapped some out of in the bottle instead of beside it, dump them into your hand, turn the scale off, put the empty bottle on it, turn it on, then toss the full amount of capsules back into it for a final weigh. If it went too far below your target weight, you can either switch out a couple of random capsules for others to potentially make the dose weigh more as some capsules are 10-20mg heavier or lighter than others. Or, if your capsule that you opened isn't filled to the brim at this stage in your taper, you can use the top of the capsule to scoop a pinch of powder into it and put the lid back on then weigh it again with the previous steps.

In the end, you should know your exact dosage every time. To most people who use powder this will sound very extra and tedious but you'd be surprised at how quickly and easily it becomes routine. It typically takes me 5 minutes from start to finish and believe it or not, I reduce by 10mg at a time. Sometimes it ends up being 20mg because 10mg can be admittedly frustrating and I'm not going to rip my hair out over it.

If your capsules are advertised as 250mg, they might contain 260 to 280mg for example. If you take 20 of them, you might be taking as much as 500mg more than you thought you were. On the flipside, it might give you some confidence when you realize that every dose you take has been different and some weighed as much as 50mg (for example) less than the one before it. You never noticed and the ignorance is bliss factor becomes realized.",3,0

I’ve tapered phenibut a few times now—relatively painlessly. I think that’s why I allowed myself to get into this situation. I wasn’t sleeping well because I was at the end of a kratom taper. I took phenibut too many days in a row. Now, I can’t say how long it’s been. Maybe 2-3 weeks? Less than a month. I went from 7-8g, quick tapered after I ran through gabapentin script too to get off kratom, and used the last of my phenibut today. I was down around 1g and took 3g today so I could run a race I signed up for without being in extra agony.

Anyway, it’s going to be cold turkey because even if I ordered more, it would take days. I also don’t want to admit I used it to my wife and spend all that the money. I wasn’t feeling absolute agony during the quick taper. I was cold, depressed, and uncomfortable. Maybe it’ll get worse than that, but here’s what I have to help: magnesium glycinate, ashwagandha, l-Theanine, clonazolam, one gabapentin I found. So far, with the clam, I’ve been sleeping. Alcohol actually helped slightly. How would you play this? I have no tolerance to the clam, and think I could use it at bedtime for a week or two and maybe get some sleep. Would you take the magnesium all day? Would the alcohol prolong the withdrawal? I understand it makes things worse for a lot of people. I would only use it at night if it helped me.

Any advice? I am trying to go through this with a good mindset. Yes, this is hell for most people, especially people that go to this sub when they are suffering… but expecting suffering doesn’t help anyone. Maybe I’ll just have a week or  two of being cold, sad, and insomnia. I hope I’ve got a taste of what I am in for, but time will tell.

I started using phenibut perhaps ten months before covid started. In the beginning I was eyeballing doses and was probably in the gram a day range. When covid came round and the initial lockdowns started, I learned (reading) that I was likely very addicted to it and got my stuff together; bought a scale and huge bulk supply in case supply chain dies etc. Anyway, I started weighing my doses. By then, I was about 3g per day.

I'm a single dad and simultaneously felt excruciating guilt and the thought that I had to keep taking this or else everything would fall apart. Up until a few weeks ago, thinking about getting off just made me panic so horribly. For over a year I'd been waking in the middle of each night in a panic at the horrible spot I'd gotten myself in to.

Anyway, by the middle of July of this year my dose had reached about 13g / day. I spent this spring organizing a long summer trip for my child so that they could spent a nice chunk of time with their mother, allowing me to try to get clean. I have my doctor working with me etc.

7-27-2021 I took 10g, and then just out of curiosity and sense of urgency, I dropped a gram a day until reaching \~3g. I've slowed down a little bit but today I've only taken one gram. I don't get it. I feel quite uninterested in most things and maybe a little hungrier than usual, but no major withdrawal effects at all. 

Because of reading here, I have been taking

\-1g Agmatine daily with phenibut dose

\-recently added 20mg fasoracetam (no noticeable changes)

\-600mg NAC daily

\-200mg L-Theanine 2x daily

\-I am on a ketogenic diet and that's been standard for me for 10+ years (mentioning just in case)

Has anyone else had anything like this happen during their taper? I have been so terrified of the withdrawals I read about. Before anyone thinks I may have fake phenibut or something, I order from that nice, reputable website that includes lab data etc. and has a reddit coupon code that's always recommended (I had been ordering the Phenibut FAA). When I took too much, I was absolutely high out of my mind and knew I'd screwed up. Well, as I type this now, I'm pretty sure I've been out of my mind high since I started using phenibut. Now I just feel kinda blegh and normal, but clearheaded.

Oh, one more thing. Apologies for the length of my post, but as I've dropped my dose I've found there's a (nearly?) constant ringing in my ears. Tinnitus. When I used to overdo the phenibut doses, I would have the ringing in my ears when I would wake up at night sometimes, but not during the afternoon like it is right now.

Thank you for the read. If anyone has feedback or ideas or questions just let me know.

Cheers.",11,3

Had several pelvic exams and even std checks even though I’ve been in an entirely monogamous relationship for going on 7 years just from panicked googling which of course came up with nothing, everything looked “great” according to the doctors. Around a month or so ago I began to wonder if phenibut was the cause but had little luck in researching it’s possible effects on the female body. I had been taking 750mg-1g 4 days a week for a little over a year and a half because up until March I had no insurance and suffer with ptsd and adhd and wanted something to help me work an unforgiving retail job. As of today I have been able to successfully go 4 days in a row without taking it without any wd issues probably due to being put on low dose adderal (5mg twice daily) and in the middle of day three which is the day I would normally take 750mg I noticed I had no weird twinges. This morning I feel great without taking anything at all and honestly I’m overjoyed that my suspicions were likely correct. My ultimate goal is to not be on anything at all, and plan to stop all meds once I have completely tapered off the phenibut. The process hasn’t been horribly difficult likely because I have never taken a stupid amount of it and never took it more than three consecutive days in a row, but ct doesn’t seem super wise and creates more potential for relapse in my opinion. I’m wondering if any other ladies experienced this and would like to hear from those who have successfully quit about how it effected their periods.

I know Baclofen works like a charm for most people, but for me, it really didn’t do much. Adding an extra gabapentin helps a lot, but if I take more gabapentin than prescribed for more than three days, I actually have small withdrawals from that.

I've had my conversation with my rehab doctor today and he's asking if I can stay longer than 5 weeks in rehab, so does my other 2 doctors at the rehab centre. Maybe I can go to a safe house afterwards. 

I backed up my phenibut dose to 5g (without the etizolam) and almost cried all morning long because I felt so anxious and depressed. I've added 7mg etizolam afterwards and things are basically fine at this moment. 

I've never experienced any benzo withdrawal in my life before, even after taking 200mg clonazolam in just 2 weeks, absurd high doses of clonazolam, been taking 25mg temazepam a year ago for 3 months. I've quit all above benzos cold turkey and never ever experienced any withdrawal. 

Until now, with this freaking etizolam. I am curious if my withdrawal will be lighter because I never experienced benzo withdrawal before? For example, 3 weeks ago I jumped down from 20mg etizolam to cold turkey and I felt anxious, sort of depressed and uncomfortable, but that was basically it. 

I've been also using baclofen for the last 2 months, only 30mg a day. I never felt any effect from it. (How do people compare it to 3g phenibut? I felt way better on 3g phenibut.) Quessing I wont have to detox from baclofen..

Then there is the phenibut. I've been using it for 2 weeks. First 2 days 2g, 2 days 4g, 2 days 6g, 2 days 7.5g and 2 days 8.5g. 

I had to increase my phenibut dose from 2g to 8.5g in just 2 weeks(!!) just to feel normal. And i feel even more anxious, depressed on 8.5g than I did on the 2g in the first place. Is this me withdrawaling and building tolerance so freaking fast?

Other helpful people on my previous topic suggested me to get back on the 20mg etizolam and quit the phenibut cold turkey (since i was on 6g+ doses basically only for a week) 

Tomorrow I'm going back to 2g phenibut and 20 mg etizolam, and cutting back the 2g phenibut as fast as possible.

My rehab doctor told me to stay on my curreny dose (10mg etizolam and 8.5g phenibut a day) but he didnt knew i was only using phenibut for 2 weeks.

What do you guys suggest me to do until detox? Diclazepam didnt work for me, i literally took 20-30 doses on a evening and felt completely nothing. Etizolam keeps me calm for now..

I bought phenibut for the first time two weeks ago and fell in love with it immediately. I did some research before I bought it but I kind of gaily skipped over the parts about withdrawal.

Well here I am, cold turkey, and considering going tee totaller for personal reasons that got bluntly revealed to me through my phenibut and alcohol abuse.

Last dose was day -1, Thursday. I was drinking heavily and blacked out. I think I took about 5g across that day (I was dosing 5 then 6 then 7 and so on because I'm a fu****g idiot)

Day 1

Not too bad, didn't realize it was withdrawals at first. Had to drive home, this was hard, heart thumping and anxiety through the roof.

Got home, and SO got home soon after. She went for drinks and I thought maybe I could go too? BIG MISTAKE. Drank 350cl of whiskey.

Day 2

Horrible hang-over. Gets worse through the day, hands and legs very Shakey. Oh shit I'm in withdrawal. Anxiety attacks worsen, panic attacks feel imminent. Make SO aware, she's supporting me.
Muster up the courage to go to the health shop and get magnesium and l theanine, they help immediately.

Now I can't sleep

Day 3 

Slept maybe 3 hours max, mostly nodding and waking, heart thumping a lot, feeling very afraid but trying not to annoy SO too much. We go to SOs parents house, it's hard but I can just about manage to socialize. They start drinking but I've decided to be tee total, really want to sleep but can't even yawn.

Drink some chamomile tea, helps feel relaxed, attempt made at sleeping around 12am, it fails.

What follows was the most difficult night of my life. With my eyes closed I see bizzare visuals and can kinda hear voice-overs and narrations which range from related stuff that can be funny or weird to disturbing stuff that's very hard to describe.

Every time I feel sleep coming on panic sets in and the same thing happens again.Really hard to control my breathing and my heart rate. Breathing exercises not working 

I get up at 3 and take 360mg valerian extract. Not working at 4 so I take another. Makes everything so much worse but manage to get some sleep.

Keep having bizarre recurring fever dream of reading about a new nootropic supplement that leads to a dependency cycle that kills you if you can't remember the suffix to its name (there's three suffixes) this is the most detailed fever dream I've ever had.

Day 4 

I'd say I got about 3 hours, probably less sleep this time. Anxiety was critical this morning, had to leave the room regularly and distance myself from people because I felt desperately awful and so very exhausted.

Got the bus home, dreadful experience, but got into the health shop before they closed and picked up Ashwaghanda, dihydramine HCl and dioralyte (a medicine for replacing salts)

As soon as I took the dioralyte most symptoms began to receed. Took 600mg Ashwaghanda soon after and this seems to be helping.


CURRENT TIME


That's where I am in this hell walkthrough. I think I have it easy compared to a lot of people because I only used for two weeks but f**k me I hate phenibut.

I'm writing this firstly to give a guide / timeline to people who under similar circumstances end up going CT. If you can avoid it and taper using baclofen please for the love of god do that CT is hell.

The second reason I'm writing this is because my main problem with getting to sleep is tactile hallucinations. My fingers and toes feel like they're moving when they aren't. It feels like I'm wearing something on my neck a lot of the time. I get small topical spasm that last about half a second and are not very frequent. Finally my eyes twitch sometimes when I hold them closed (can't tell if they're actually twitching or I'm just hallucinating it.

I feel a lot calmer right not but that's not hard to say because the nights are clearly the worst. I should mention that i am dosing supplements as follows;



L theanine 200mg 4-6 times a day

Magnesium 160mg 2-3 times a day 

Ashwaghanda 300mg 2-3 times a day

Dioralyte as required when heart beat is very noticable 

Diphenhydramine HCl, will use 60mg tablets instead of valerian because valerian is a GABA-a agonist (SOs mum describes it as natural valium and I was desperate) and I think that's what made the experience so much worse 



Any advice to cope a bit better and get more sleep would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks guys

Dose seems to have crept up to about 4-6gpd taken in gram scoops throughout the day.

About 6 days ago while having to self isolate with my family I decided I was going to lower my dose. Took a few half scoops throughout the day, started to feel funny - insane mental fog like i could barely keep a train of thought going and getting frustrated if more then one thing was happening at once as I couldn’t cope. Anyway didn’t really put 2 and 2 together and assumed it was stress and illness and it’s only in retrospect I realised that my dose had crept if you’d asked I’d have thought I was at 3gpd tops.

Kept going the next day but just 2x1 gram scoops - mental fog remained and I found myself behaving strangely in the evenings. Anxiety, disassociation, paranoia.  I took a couple of days off work and realised about day 3 it was definitely the Phenibut causing my issues.  I figured I should keep it up and now am on day 6 at 2gpd.  Ive
 been progressively feeling better and the weirdness is only coming on in the evenings.

I’ve been slightly worried about my mental well-being and also freaking my family out and I don’t fully trust everything my brain is telling me right now.
Question is should I continue to level off at 2gpd and if so how much longer am I going to feel these effects?  I’m strong enough I won’t ‘relapse’ or up my dose.  How long should I stick there? I plan to taper more sensibly off the last 2 grams, is there a good way to dose without scales?  Also I have a strange taste to everything, cigarettes, coffee.  It’s unpleasant, anyone else get this?

Thanks for your time.",3,0

Let me tell you something about me first.

I've abused etizolam on a daily dose of 20mg a day for the last 6 months, on and off. 

Eventually I discovered withdrawals when dosing 20mg etizolam or under.

I started to take baclofen, but since my doctor wont prescribe it anymore I moved on to phebibut. 

2 grams a day was enough to help for the etizolam withdrawals. Unfortunately only for 2 days. 

Eventually i had to increase my pheninut dose from 2gr to 9gr phenibut a day in just 2 weeks, plus I'm taking 10mg etizolam with it and I still feel depressed, anxious, lack of appetite, no sleep, even suicidal.

In 3 weeks I'm going to a detox. My stay in there can't be longer than 5 weeks.

How the hell am I detoxing from the phenibut and etizolam in just 5 weeks? Looking at the doses I'm currently taking.

It scares me so much that I'm still withdrawaling on a dose of 9g phenibut and 10mg etizolam a day. How worse will I feel when going cold turkey? This idea scares the shit out of me.

Any helpful thoughts or advice would mean a lot to me at this moment

- EDIT - I've only used phenibut for 3 weeks",7,0

One thing I’ve noticed is that I’ll get pretty bad pins and needles in my head that will last a week, is this withdrawals or rebound? FYI I usually take large doses throughout a single day and I do mean large, borderline OD but never full OD which I had a problem with a few years back but have gotten good with countering it.

I am also in a bout with kratom on day 7 of quitting and I’ve noticed that kratom always helped with phenibut withdrawal/rebound. Could the withdrawal from kratom increase this effect from phenibut?

Thanks!",2,0
