For those that got addicted to phenibut and don’t mind sharing, how did you get addicted? More specifically, did you start abusing it (or using it daily) immediately, or was it something that happened over time? At what point did you realize you were “addicted,” and what was your usage like at the time? Do you think it’s possible to use responsibly? I don’t have experience with the supplement, but it sounds interesting for its pro-social, anti-anxiety properties.",4
2021-01-30 20:44:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/l91gdh/update4_months_in_slow_taper/,Update/4 months in slow taper,"I am a 4 year+ Phenibut user at doses ranging from 1-6 gpd. It totally changed my life in the beginning and was magical. At my place of employment, I went from being a cashier to a store manager in a short amount of time after starting due to the magic of it all. 

Then came the withdrawals in the beginning, thinking that lowering my dose by even a single capsule would make a difference...a mistake that too many will make unfortunately. 

Fast forward I am now at a point in my life where I am in a good place, have a girlfriend of nearly 3 years, and am finally ready to give up the crutch of it all. Phenibut. 

I have a love/hate relationship with this chemical. It’s totally changed my life but has also made me feel extremely ill at other times. It’s something that I don’t simply want to be a part of anymore. I have utilized the “tools” that lie in Phenibut but I’m ready to move on and think again.

I have been on Phenibut HCL specifically for so long that the HCL component is a big component in a lot of the withdrawals as well. HCL is hydrochloric acid, it’s why that form tastes so repulsive and makes your stomach a different acidity. HCL is sold as a dietary supplement to produce more stomach acid. Phenibut FAA can be a better alternative(slightly more potent/way less acidic/however more expensive)

I started my taper in late October from 5.1 gpd for ~2.5 years to 4.1 gpd with 10 mg Baclofen and did so for several weeks. I had ALOT Of Phenibut and LITTLE Baclofen at the time, so decided best to utilize the Phenibut surplus before making the total switch. Lately I am happy to report that I am currently at 3.6 gpd Phenibut with 5 mg Baclofen assistance. Which should equal to 4100 mg Phenibut. 

I know many will be surprised that I haven’t dropped the dose further but the most important thing for me currently is a gradual change. I have been dependent for so long and currently my job, a store manager of a grocery store during a pandemic while managing 27 employees, can be quite stressful to say the least.

There are days when I don’t feel great, but I know the lessons I’ve learned from life and Phenibut will guide me out of the dark days. Just a reminder to everyone that you must come to terms with your addiction and decide to make the change, but do it in a way that will be most suitable for you personally. There’s no need to cause unnecessary suffering if you don’t have to. This chemical requires discipline to be finally stomped out once and for all. You must make the choice to get off, or continue your old ways 

I am hoping to be 100% Phenibut/Baclofen free by the end of 2021 and will continue my slow, controlled taper and will update my progress for everyone here. We are in this battle together.

Thank you all for reading my paragraphs of texts and hope you all have a splendid day :)",12

2021-01-29 07:31:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/l7rdp1/if_youre_trying_to_quit_avoid_reading_other/,"If you're trying to quit, avoid reading other people's hellish w/d experiences.","I think reading about people's horror stories won't do you any good when preparing for withdrawal. I think it will make things harder for you regardless of the drug. Right now I'm trying to quit phenibut, Let me tell you why I'm avoiding reading any w/d reports or ""what to expect"" posts.

 I was addicted to kratom three times

The first time I was taking it every day for 4 years with occasional hydros, I quit cold turkey and tried to keep my mind occupied in any way, I also avoided consciously acknowledging how horrible I felt. It really really sucked but it was definitely manageable.

Then got re addicted a year later, I took it for a 14 months and quit just like last time. I felt compelled to put energy into thoughts like ""wow I feel horrible, when will this end, this is how I feel, will I feel worse tomorrow"", etc. I consciously avoided my subconscious impulsion to analyze my negative feelings.

It was pretty manageable both times.

My third time I got addicted 13 months later. I ended up taking a similar slightly less amount as the previous time, for a shorter period of time. But this time it was **nothing** like the fist two times. It was significantly more difficult, and it felt beyond the point of unbearable. The physical aspect was nothing, but the mental anxiety, fear, turmoil and dread was truly hell.

What changed? Looking back, I realized that whilst I was in my third time of addiction, I discovered /r/quittingkratom and I spent a lot of time reading the withdrawal hell report of people who took a lot less kratom than I was taking, for a much shorter period of time. Some people said it was worse than their painkiller w/d. I remember feeling like I was absolutely fucked and maybe I just couldn't remember my previous withdrawals as well as I thought I did. I put lots and lots of energy into focusing how I would feel when I quit cold turkey. Then when I quit, my main focus throughout my withdrawal was how exactly I was feeling, I didn't really attempt to distract myself in any way, and I fully submitted to the urge to analyze how shitty I felt. 

So in hindsight I can say that reading other people's experiences really discouraged me. That change in mindset and expectation had a surprising effect on how I handled
 w/d.

So here I am today. For three months, I've taken phenibut everyday, some how without even realizing it. I just started taking a scoop here or there, and then every day. When I ran out, I looked at my purchase date and realized how quickly I went through the whole thing, I did some math and realized I was taking 1 - 2 grams a day. I actively avoid w/d reports because have no reason to read anyone elses w/d reports.

I immediately bought more, and began a fast taper. Right away I dropped my dose to .8 grams once every two days. Two weeks later I'm down to .5 - .6 grams every 60 - 72 hours. It's not that bad, I do have anxiety and I am restless, but this is manageable. I'm trying not to think about how I feel too much, I just accept that things are going to be different for a bit. My current state of being is temporary and there's nothing I can do about it so I accept it. If you are afraid of w/d, do not worry. Welcome the fact that you aren't going to feel good and Don't fight it by focusing on how badly you want to feel better, and how much agony you are experiencing, it's futile. Avoid that thought process as much as you can. Right now, feeling bad, and feeling anxiety is *good* for me, it's an essntial part of the process for my brain to heal.

I encourage you to pull the trigger and begin your process in quitting! It's definitely do able! Don't read any hellish w/d reports, they won't help you.",45

2021-01-27 16:21:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/l6enmp/cold_turkey_large_dose_phenibut/,Cold turkey large dose phenibut,"I recently posted about how I dropped from doing anywhere from (20g-25g) a day of phenibut to roughly 12-14 grams a day.  You can read that post to show all the steps I took, maybe it’ll be helpful for those in my position.  I began tapering because the magic left, and nightmare of “glutamate storms” (not sure If that’s what it really is) replaced it.

Even though I’ve been at this dose for ~3 weeks my body still rejects phenibut.  I ironically feel better when I skip my 2 dose and feel the beginning of WD then when I’m on the dose (1-6 ) hours.  It’s like my body has learned how toxic it is and is telling me to f*** off already.

Thankfully I’m prescribed 60mg of baclofen already (take some occasionally) and gabapentin (only 600mg a day), but most of these meds are stored up.  I also have extra baclofen, 60 (500mg) lyrica, 30 xanax bars and some RC benzos.  

I know tapering is always option number 1, for good reason, it prevents extreme brain changes overnight.  But I’m miserable on phenibut. If I dose at the wrong time, I have to take 50 mg doxylamine, 50 mg Benadryl, and occasionally .5 mg of xanax.  This has caused me to miss work/ be late for work 3-4x because it makes it impossible to wake up from.  I’m my bosses favorite, and I just lost my cousin to suicide, my best friend to suicide, so thankfully I haven’t lost my damn job.  

Once I settle my debt (600 from buying drugs + 1.5 kilos of Phenibut, I’d gladly quit my job to rid myself of phenibut addiction (if I explain my health problems they’d hire me back.

My solution as of now (no insurance for detox), is to quit CD.  Take 100-160 mg baclofen a day, and take 500mg lyrica in the morning, 500mg at night.  Take the xanax if i feel like a seizure, and take clonidine for my BP.  Tapering is out the door, I’ve literally tried every medicine to make it better, but the phenibut is so toxic to me that my skin and fingers are literally peeling.

Idk how to shorten this or even how to do a quick recap, so thank you for reading truly.  Please lmk If you have any suggestions on If this will work, how long it’ll take to adjust, and how to taper off baclofen and lyrica (when I hope and pray it does work).  

I put my face down praying and crying to any god out there to help me through.  I’m on my last leg, I’ve suffered through heroin addiction, super high dose tianeptine addiction, and none scare me as bad as this.

My only other option is to beg my local hospital to take me as a free patient, or go out Kurt colbain style (I don’t want to, but that’s where I’m at).  

Pray for me my friends of all religions, I need it badly.",6

This is an article worth reading, most phenibut-related problems I believe are linked to glutamate. Sometimes Phenibut suddenly stops working, regardless of the dosage taken, and starts producing weird side effects.

Some people notice this when they start their fast taper, where the Gaba/Glutamate balance becomes way off. 

Others get this from consuming MSG foods for a period of time OR getting a leaky gut (ongoing diarrhea) from taking in all that HCL & losing vital vitamins and nutrients in the process...   
*(Not having enough vitamins/minerals to naturally produce GABA, nor convert Glutamate to GABA, resulting in tremors)*

I hope this short article can be helpful for many, to resolve their issue (peacefully) before getting into that hellish emotional loop we all know. Best of luck.",3

I took this a copied it from a journal about the actions it has on the central nervous system:

Taurine reduces glutamate-induced elevation of [Ca2+]I by inhibiting calcium influx from various calcium channels including the reverse mode of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, various voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) such as L-, N- and P/Q-type, and glutamate NMDA receptors.

As you all know, this is the primary action of phenibut as it acts on VGCC 5 fold higher that GABAb. So it basically binds to the same receptors as Phenibut reducing Glutamate toxicity. Beta Alanine from what I read is great for the anxiety aspect of WD. Taurine is good for all the glutamate surges binding to the same site.

I'm not going through WD but I like to research and help people that might be going through it and so what from what I researched it looks like amino acids might be the best supplements for WD. 

Has anyone tried this combo and did it work for you? 

Hope this helps anyone, have a good day 😊",8

I think this will inspire others, and give hope. Last may i bought a large tub of faa phenibut. I was aware of issues so only took on weekends. It only ever really helped with sleep and a little relaxation. Maybe 2g was my limit and some weekends i didn't do it. I have tried to not drink a lot since the pandemic started but drank on weekends too sometimes together. Not much more than 3-4 beers. In August I had a good amount of gabapentin available. I started taking that on the weekend, less phenibut, same booze. I noticed i had to taper during the week of the gaba and i would substitute phenibut to help. This began a cycle of never really feeling good unless i was kinda high from them. The anxiety got worse, the insomnia, up and down sadness and occasional aggressive feelings and suicidal thoughts. Ive never had them before. All of this while im getting interviews and rejections, the political turmoil, and feeling isolated. A few weeks ago i did land a good job. But i was dealing with what i can only now explain as the compound impact of gabapentin, phenibut, and alcohol, its like they all turned on me at once. Very little upside and a terrible downside. So two weeks ago i tapered the gaba to zero. One week and two days since then. But the next day after that i loaded up on phenibut and alcohol. So this past week was hellish. I had no booze all week and tapered phenibut. Last weekend i had about 2g friday 1.5 Saturday night. 1 sunday. I was breaking them down into a morning and night dose. I got down to about 700mg total by Tuesday or Wednesday and started decreasing the morning dose and holding steady with the nightly. Thursday i went down to about 500 total. My plan was to reduce drastically and deal with a rough weekend and maybe jump off. Friday was rough but i only had one 250 dose and skipped the night one. I slept poorly and felt bad yesterday. I forced a bike ride. Came home and when i felt terrible took 150. Last evening none but felt kinda bad. Slept better last night and feel a bit better. It was finally like the fog lifted. Said ok im dumping this tub down the sink this morning. I was anxious about it but think im ok, way better than ive felt in weeks. I have a little anxiety. Some diarrhea. Weird sensations on my skin, slightly. No zaps. No headache. I methodically approached this and the jump off wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The compounding of booze phenibut and gabapentin was bad. So i eliminated one at a time. Exercise was the best for me. Full range of vitamins idk hard to tell. Magnesium is essential. I bought valerian root. Not sure of that. It was a hellish drawn out period but already im feeling way better. This was long but I hope it helps someone. Make it your goal to dump that tub, wash that shit down the drain and don't buy it again.",11

What's the deal with these 2 substances?","I have been on daily microdosing phenibut for like 22 months. I have tried kratom the last 6-8 months on and off. It wasn't u til just 3 weeks ago I began trying the kratom every day as lead and not the extract powder for work outs since I have chronic pain.

But sometime along this timeline one or both of these have been producing horrible paradoxical effects. Like, I was on mushrooms or acid and hallucinating like crazy both open eye and closed eye. My nerves began to feel on fire. I felt terrible but couldn't figure out why I felt so toxic.

I quit phenibut with baclofen, agmatine, NAC, and lyrica. Okay, so it has only been a day or so off phenibut but I consider that I quit. I know symptoms may still appear. 

I've read a lot of people say kratom helps phenibut withdrawal and vice versa. I've thought kratom can feel very narcotic, very euphoric, great pain relief, good mood boost. I could get by without sleep. But it seems that kratom has absolutely no effect anymore beginning with stopping phenibut.

I get no euphoria, no narcotic feeling, no mood boost, no energy. Just terrible headaches. And the kratom is the same. I've tried different doses today. 8g, 12g, and 14g. None of them worked. 8-10g was my standard dose. I thought it was tolerance at first. But I got some kratom extract that always was my favorite. Took it and felt just vaguely nasty.

So while I plan to quit kratom anyway, this new turn of events has me wondering if there is a connection? Why would stopping one affect the other? I mean, I am taking baclofen+lyrica to replace phenibut as well as agmatine and NAC for my recovery. Nothing new.

Any ideas, info on this, plZ share. My recovery and decision to use what I am using to quit phenibut aren't up for discussion!",2

ACT 1   After tapering loperamide that I had been on for 4 years, I had absolutely no joy, no interest in doing anything, dysphoric and always anxious. I found out about phenibut on the other subreddit. around  2/2020 . The warnings were all there. Don’t take it 2 days in a row or only take on weekends or take it once a week or every 2 weeks. That’s great advice! Until you get awful rebound anxiety and that little bit of powder will fix it. Combine that with smoking weed and taking a stim,  I’ve never felt anything  like that in my life! I LOVED everyone and wanted to talk to anybody and everybody. Calling and getting with friends I haven’t seen in years. And the music, omgosh the music. 

ACT 2    It turned on me. I had to take more and more to get the inner torment to stop. . My head started  vibrating and I kept hearing symphonies playing or sirens coming. My ceiling fan would move up and down, up and down  in slow motion.  Hardly slept for a week. So I got a scale, my U/Mustchange19 and I figured out my dose  (4g) and I tapered  down to . 89. Twice a day.  with some help from baclofen. (That’s a whole other beast (Derealization when stopping or tapering too fast. 

ACT3    It was the holidays  and I was feeling my normal, crappy self so I thought I’d try some extra  Phenibut. It was phenomenal again. Until a few days ago when IT WOULD NOT WORK. Several times I passed out standing in the bathroom as my phone hit the floor. My head felt like it was going to explode. I could hear clicking in my head. My chest was burning, I couldn’t get dressed, I was convulsing from the panic going through my body.  I just knew I was gonna die or kill myself. Told my son to take me to ER. 

ACT4   I told the Dr I was on Phenibut, of course he had never heard of it and as he was leaving I begged him to help me. He assured me he would but needed to go read about it.i silently prayed that didn’t mean (google it) I was so hot I ripped my shirt off, I couldn’t sit still, I was begging God to help me. I felt so humiliated. They brought in 2 Ativan shots and I swore it wouldn’t work. But it did. I passed out for I don’t know how long bc the next thing I know The nurse was wheeling me out and I was like I haven’t even seen the Dr. That wonderful Dr  gave my son Ativan to give me through the night until the pharmacy opened in the morning. I was sent home with 30 Ativan a few of those did cause rebound but gabapentin fixes that. 

**Fentanyl showed up in my urine screen. I’ve never taken it and don’t know where to get it if I want it. 🕵🏼🤔🤔 

ACT 5 I feel really good. Husband is monitoring my medication, because, you know I’m an addict. Son came home when was in the hospital and threw it all out, scales and all. Im have a grand baby on the way in July and I want to be the best I can be for that precious one. I only had one child who is so a amazing and I couldn’t be more proud of him. I want to be right when this bundle of joy gets here. And I want you all to be here too. You are so loved, more than you can imagine!",29

I gave a fuck about anything at all. I slept well, I felt real emotions, I felt like me again.

My background in phenibut is that I used from around October 2019 to June 2020 at an average of 6.5 grams per day. I started at 1 gram per day and by December 2019 I was at 6.5: then from June to august 2020 I tapered off 100mg per day until the last 300mg where I went to -50mg per day and by late august I was completely off. 

Ever since I hit the 3grams per day mark of my taper life has been a cold grey shell of what it used to be. Nothing brings me joy without the aid of substances, sobriety is a cold purgatory that I objectively wouldn’t deem worthwhile in the Face of all of the negativity and constant Chinese water torture style generalized anxiety that comes with it since I’ve quit. People told me that things would get better but at this point I believe that either those people have tricked themselves into believing they feel better or that through my use of phenibut I’ve done such an extensive amount of damage to my gabanergic systems in my brain that I’m either beyond repair or that my Baseline sense of well being is permanently lowered. I was always an anxious person genetically to begin with so no matter what I’ll never feel amazing sober to begin with.

After relapsing a few days ago I’ve started thinking that maybe a life addicted to phenibut is better than the cold grey nothingness I have to look forward to now. I quit phenibut in the first place out of fear that it may be made illegal at some point and that I’d be in some real trouble but I could get a stockpile of baclofen and hold onto it in case that happens. Tapering was a bitch but I’m heavily considering just staying on phenibut and then if anything were to happen that cuts off my ability to get phenibut permanently I could use the baclofen to taper as it’s much easier and in the end I’d just be where I’m at right now. 

Hopefully someday they have some sort of fix for people with broken gaba systems like me but I’m almost 100% decided on going back on phenibut because my quality of life was so much better then. It’s not the best option obviously but I feel that I’m in the situation I’m in because of my Initial use or phenibut and that unfortunately I can’t walk back on that. If I could I would but I cant.

Try to space out your doses as much as possible. I have had a 5 gpd habit for a few years now and started tapering and using Baclofen at the end of October. I noticed with my dose logs that I wasn’t tapering as fast as I would like and was more using Baclofen in place of the Phenibut.

However the last week, I have tried to space out my Phenibut doses as much as possible, ex. One 800 mg capsule every 4 hours or so as opposed to what I used to do, 2 capsules upon waking and a 3rd about 4 hours later. I have been able to drop my daily Phenibut dose by 800 mg this past week just by doing that alone. I am timing it where I take my last Phenibut dose around ~7hours before desired sleep, to not have negative sleep effects. Alcohol is consumed leading up to when the Phenibut kicks in but only about 2-3 drinks per night. It helps. 

I will update my progress over the next few months. I’ve been a daily user for about ~5 years with the exception a cold Turkey withdrawal break around 3 years ago at a 4 gpd habit. I managed to be off the Phenibut for 3 months, but was suffering withdrawal even still and went back on. Probably due to my cold Turkey method",3

I am just a normal person who got clean after a week of psychosis in withdrawal and hope to help others.

If you are experiencing glutamate surges from phenibut use(aka phenibut hell) and in phenibut hell(search this subreddit for ""glutamate surges"" for more info) than NAC might help you. I got clean from phenibut a few months(I found an online shop that fedexes baclofen to the USA in a week PM me if you need the site) ago but started taking this NAC supplement recently and it has made my cravings much less and feel better.

After research NAC has been very promising in studies for drug addictions(some studies show giving NAC to groups who want treatment double the rate of abstinence) , and this

 NAC is thought to upregulate the glutamate transporter (GLT-1) that removes excess glutamate from the nucleus accumbens.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R6)  

Phenibut hell is thought to be caused by glutamate surges so NAC sounds perfect to both people still in use and people who have stopped phenibut but still have symptoms.

As a result, it is has been proposed that pharmacotherapies that help correct glutamate dysregulation may be effective in promoting abstinence or preventing relapse to a substance.[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R5),[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R6)

NAC may reverse the neural dysfunction seen in SUDs. As an OTC antioxidant that impacts glutamatergic functioning in the brain, NAC has long been used to treat acetaminophen overdose; however, in recent years, researchers have begun to tap its potential for treating substance use and psychiatric disorders. NAC is thought to upregulate the glutamate transporter (GLT-1) that removes excess glutamate from the nucleus accumbens.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R6) Several published reviews provide more in-depth information about the neurobiology of NAC.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R6)–[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5993450/#R10)",3

I hadn’t thought about this is a long time, but I remembered today that when I first started using phenibut daily I began having horrible panic attacks daily, which brings me to believe the phen was doing very bad things for my already bad generalized anxiety. Now that I’m 10 days off, my anxiety honestly feels better than ever. While on phenibut I was convinced the 2400mg of gabapentin I was taking wasn’t working, but I think that’s because I had been using phen at such high doses for so long that I was pretty much in constant withdrawal. Thank u to everyone on this sub for listening to my rants, posting here throughout the last year and a half has helped a SHIT ton. Peace tf out",8

Sort of freaking out.,"So, I measure out my pheni doses usually ahead of time, I take 670mg 5am in the morning and 720 5pm evening... However when I did take my dose this morning after being up all night, since my sleep schedule has been off I've been usually dosing an hour or two earlier, or later. But, I went to bed after taking it, I woke up anxious at 2pm and foggy due to sleep deprivation, and accidentally, took tomorrows morning dose thinking I just missed my morning dose today I took the 680mg very sleeped out and feeling dumb.. But I didn't miss my dos, I just realized I took my morning dose twice, I just double dosed when I woke up at 2pm..






Since it's only 3 hours away from my ""evening dose"" should I just redose to make up the difference of 670-720 and have this as my night dose, and continue on schedule tomorrow?

Should I just continue as normal as if nothing happened?


EDIT:
With the others downvoting the post, I understand it may be frustrating to see similar questions over and over. But I think we all can agree, phenibut dependency is basically an aqcuired mental illness, my OCD has been chronic with overthinking and anxiety, the anxiety of messing up, and for me, honestly anxiety when waking up, ever since I've gotten the unfortune of being dependent to phenibut. I apologize if it seems stupid and silly to ask such question, but for a moment, I think we all can relate to anxious moments as such, as most people like me who do post, yes, we are aware there's tons of other posts, it's hard to explain, but it just helps better to ask, and get reassured, especially with an already present anxiety disorder. I'm sure there's some who can understand. I try to upvote such posts if I see them, or I honestly just don't leave a vote at all, and I hope putting some perspective on why some people re-post already asked questions from anxiety happens, especially with gabaergics and the tapering process. it's intimidating for a lot, scary to make mistakes, especially for the overthinkers as I mentioned earlier, who have already present chronic anxiety disorders. 

Certainly imagine if people at AA, or NA, had a downvote button for each time someone has anxiety, I guess to put another example. We're here to help eachother.

I hope I changed some peoples perspectives ready to hit the downvote or leave any negative comment.",19

It mostly worked, but I don't want to ever buy phenibut again.  I have a large reserve quantity **(1.75 Kilos)**, but this taper has dragged on.  

**-Currently take 6-9 grams as soon as I wake up, usually feel it in 2 hours.  Mild head pressure, but overall feel okay.  Second dose I usually take 5-7 hours later, at 8 grams.  This brings on the head pressure and uncomfortable feelings associated with glutamate out of the charts**.  I got into this mess because at 10 grams this begin to happen, so I upped my dose until the GABA was more noticeable than the glutamate surges **(TAPER ASAP IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU)**.  This clearly ended poorly

**-Given that the second dose gives me the most problems, I'm thinking about replacing that entire dose with 60 mg baclofen (a tad lower than the EQ, whcih would be 80 mg) while also adding a 500mg Lyrica to make up for the missing gabapent action.**  

\-I'm unsure of this plan, but I like it because tapering has been a mental MF, and I can't keep affording to take Xanax everytime I have a panic attack.  **I also need to be mentally + physically all there because I'm a lift driver in a warehouse, and have zero desire to get fired at this pivotal point.  My lyrica tolerance is zero, and I'm unsure how it relates strength wise to phenibuts gaba action.**

**-Suggestions? Should I go all at once and see how I respond, or should I take out 4 grams while adding 40mg baclofen and no lyrica.  Thankfully have a lifelong Dr., scripted 60mg Baclofen a day, with several hundred ordered and received.  I also have all the basic supplements, plus gabapentin.  I have 58 500mg lyric  Taking 1 a day would obv. last me 58 days, and then I have several.  I also have xanax, the double edged sword, but I try to keep it at a minimum to avoid a full blown benzo addiction as well.**

\-**At this point the second dose gives me severe facial flushing, my BP (checked) hits 170-190 (systolic) my skin is so dry at work I've had to super glue 4-7 fingers to keep them from bursting open over and over.  I need badly to be in the single digits to hopefully end the super caustic effect Phenibut has had on my body.**  Thankfully I'm 240 lb and workout religiously, otherwise this excess cortisol + glutamate would probably have given my ticker a heart attack by now.  Somehow on the elliptical I'm able to knockout 12 miles at a 6 minute pace, which gives me home my body won't quit on me. Even then, I'm still maxing out at 5 hours of sleep, unless I take my Xanax, sleep 10 hours and wake up in full panic mode from no Phenibut.  

\-Sorry for the extended post, not sure how to condense it because it was all important to me to explain how quickly I need this addiction to end.  Could anyone that has gone from 12+ grams give me some advice? **I'm having nightmares of having to go to detox where god knows I'd end up with long lasting brain damage with a 3-24 month recovery period.**

**-If you made it through my word vomit, god bless you, and feel free to reach out if you are in a similar experience.  With lots of supplements I went from an AVG. of 24G a day to 16G very fast.  It's possible to end the nightmare, but I think we all need help from each other to get there.  Much love to my junkies out there**.  **Those that are tapering that offer good responses will receive my excess Phenibit to continue your taper cheaply.**

\***If you are at the point of 3-4 grams and no longer getting a response, taper now, and avoid the hell I am living \*Xanax + Lyrica are highly addicting and should never be taken lightly!!!\***

Successful Taper - A Message of Hope to Those in Need,"I initially started using Phenibut to taper off alcohol. It worked for a while, but then I found myself physically dependent on both.   
I was averaging about 5 grams a day of FAA and 10 drinks a day for about 6 months.  
 (I think. For a while I wasn't even measuring or counting, it was probably higher in October/November)  
Any time I tried to reduce either substance slightly, I experienced insane glutamate surges and panic attacks -  and had to quickly redose.   


This all came to a head when I found myself jerking violently awake every 30 minutes in my sleep.   
Skin burning, amnesia, bones aching, high BP and heartrate - the works.   


What saved me: **Agmatine and NAC.**   


I determined my baseline dosage of both alcohol and pheni. Started taking 2 caps of Agamatine, and 1 cap of NAC in the morning with my Kratom.  


This almost immediately prevented the glutamate surges and hence prevented me from running to redose.   


I would basically wait until as far into the day as possible when my heart rate became unbearable and take 250MGs and have 1 drink. I would monitor this and repeat as needed, but only when necessary.   


The next day, I would try to push it even further into the day, until eventually, I was only having a nightcap. I maintained a nightcap for a few days and just recently dropped that.   


I was able to stretch my need for a dose by taking a concoction of **Valerian root, chamomile tea, and kava.** With this approach, I was able to completely reach 0 on both substances in about 10 days. I feel better than ever.   


One way I got thru the symptoms is to remind myself *""I either suffer now, or suffer later"".*  I think some people struggle with the taper because they want it to be painless, so they stretch the taper to unnecessary lengths and never really make any progress.  


Accept the suffering, it's temporary - but be safe about it. Monitor your heart rate and BP, don't feel defeated if you have to redose to stabilize.

So each hour that I was able to tough it out, didn't seem hopeless - because I had built a reward system into the taper. ""If I get through this wave, I'll experience less of a wave later""   


But don't take more than a maintenance dose each time. (This may not be possible at the very beginning, just be honest with yourself and document everything). The taper is not always a straight line.   


Stay the course. Get the supplements I mentioned and take it hour by hour. You will make it. 

Hope this helps.",16

My personality seems mostly back to normal. The rebound anxiety/depression are manageable enough. The hardest part is getting up in the morning. I’ve always struggled with anxiety and depression even before I started phenibut, so idk how much of what I’m feeling is from the withdrawals or the underlying mental illnesses. I had cravings for phenibut and almost bought more before stopping myself. I reasoned that if I’m still craving it, then I shouldn’t even think about buying it. Still, it’s hard.

I’ve been taking roughly 12.5 mg of trazodone to help me sleep every night to help with the insomnia that the withdrawals have given me. I’ve noticed that on days I don’t go running, I need to take 25 mg of trazodone to sleep, and when I do run, taking half is enough. I also know that trazodone can (and does) make me groggy in the morning, so maybe that’s contributing to the morning depression. 

I talked about going for a run and I want to add more to that subject. More than anything, doing cardio on a regular basis has personally helped me recover more than any sort of nootropic that I’ve been recommended. I’ve always exercised regularly, and that helps, but running on a regular basis has been a godsend. It makes sense too. The human body has evolved to move around a lot. It’s been observed that exercise increases the brain’s ability to make new connections, so it also probably helps with recovery. Honestly, just thinking about running right now has put me in a better mood. I think I’m gonna drink some water and go for a good run to help kickstart my day",2

Anyone here have any personal experience with either of these? Or other suggestions to help me kick this shit for good? I’m tired of taking it everyday just to feel human for a couple hours. Or waking up every day with no will to live, but still having to go to work.

My advice first of all is if you are taking a large dose to taper right down before you go into hospital. I was at 15 grams and I tapered to 2g. While I  hospital I was given 10mg of baclofen 3 times a day and valium if I needed it. Apart from some sleep disturbances it really wasnt unpleasant atall, infact I feel like the baclofen completely substituted the phenibut. I've been here for 5 days and I'm out  tomorrow with a taper plan. I know the taper may be uncomfortable but my taper from 15g to 2g was also painfull but only until I stabilised on the 2g. My taper was pretty fast I took one less gram everyday so it took 14 days for me to taper from 15g to 2g. I had tremors and depressed but I also had valium which stopped the tremors. I may have just been lucky but I actually feel good and it really wasnt as scary as I thought it would be. I think the best thing is to stay positive. You hear so many horror stories on this thread and although I really feel for the people who went through hell coming off, not everyone will have a bad experience. So stay strong and taper. If you're doing it at home, I'd suggest tapering to 1 or 2 grams before you take the baclofen. Take as much time as you need depending on  how you respond. If one gram less a week is better for you do that. 10mg baclofen is 1g of phenibut so when you're on the 1g come off and take the baclofen, you may find that it replaces it completely like it did for me, and you experience no withdrawal. I hope this has given hope to some people. There is a way out this addiction and it may not be as bad as you are worrying about.",13

I have one more month to get to a year and out of nowhere the urge to relapse just increased exceptionally.,"You know those relapse thoughts or actual relapses, where it’s like a done deal that’s it’s going to happen? There’s always that little thought that just seems to envelop in your brain, “Ok, I’m for sure going to do this.” 

All of you know what I’m talking about, right? 

Well, here’s the thing.  I kicked phenibut on 02/12/2020. I went through an absolute nightmare of a withdrawal. It was like a bad acid trip that lasted for a week straight, with some physical symptoms thrown in for good measure.   
Once I got to Mid May 2020, the cravings for phenibut left me. I had no urge, planning, ideas, or desire to dose phenibut from mid-May 2020 until 01/14/2021 (Thursday) at 2 am.  

This is literally what I am telling myself.  (Btw. Yes, I am an addict)   “You know what, remember how fucking amazing phenibut would make you feel?  We’ll do it right this time!  Only once a week!  1-2 grams every Saturday. No exceptions!”

Bruh, I have a month left till I’m at a YEAR off phenibut.   And If I’m honest.  I’m set ON doing it. I know this may seem or sound fucking idiotic.  Maybe a part of me is posting on here so somebody could talk me out of it. Or to be told not to fuck up, idk.   All my relapses for any substance have always been when the “final driving decision point” to relapse just comes up out of nowhere.    

The ONLY difference this time; is this is the FIRST time I’m letting someone (or a group know) 99.9% of the time, I would have relapsed, no doubt about it.  

So I’m giving myself two days before I decide to dose pheni again.     Maybe something will pop up in my head telling me NOT to do it and get to a year and just keep going.   

I just thought I’d share with you all BEFORE I relapsed and see if maybe I could steer the ship.  

Love you guys.",3

I abused it really bad from june to october 2019 and was at 5 grams at day but i tapered it off in november to 2g, and then quit cold turkey it but only for 1 week. It was terrible experience i gotta say

In december 2019 i told myself im not gonna take more than 2g a day ever in my life again, its been already 13 months and i never did more than 2 g since then because i was so terrified im gonna have those insane withdrawals again

However, for past 13 months i did only few 1 week tolerance breaks. Im currently at 1g-1.25g a day it all depends.

I dont think i can even recall last time i experienced some euphoria or even stimulation. Positive effects are really minor i can only notice anxiety suppression and sociability and maybe sleep is not too bad , but there are no side effects either. It feels like im just taking it to don't withdraw and that's all.

It feels like it became part of me and i dont even know if i want to quit it. It has helped me with anxiety and depression and probably still does but when i stop taking it for few days i feel depersonalization and depression coming back and it really scares me more than benzo withdrawals.

I quit phenibut first a little under 2 years. Anyways made the bad decision of thinking I could use it moderately. Ended up using for 3 months. Wasn’t daily the whole time but for 2 months it was pretty much daily with a few breaks and got up to 3-4g a day, maybe more on some days. Then for one month I was around 2.5g a day every other day.

Now I’m tapering more seriously. I’m at a 1.3g dose late afternoon to help with sleep. My sleep is pretty broken up. Some nights better than others. I’ve been trying to drop 100mg a day. But the last night was pretty rough so I may try to stabilize at 1.3g for a few days. 

I’ve been using kratom to help but I feel like that could just cause another issue so i stopped that. It helped a lot when I dropped down from the 3-4+g doses because I was feeling much worst around then than I am right now. I take 1g of agmatine with my doses. Along with that a b vitamin complex, melatonin, cannabis edibles (at night) and occasionally valerian or kava at night. 

Feeling more hopeful now! I was in a really rough headspace when I first started dropping. I see hope and feel confident about sticking with the taper.",2

Update,"I’m past the 2 week period of acute symptoms, and now I’m probably at the PAWs. I’ve been taking trazodone at night to make sure I can sleep. I’ve been on it for over a month, and even though it’s supposed to be “non-addictive”, I’m not taking my chances and am slowly tapering off of it just in case.  I was given 30 50mg tablets. I’ve been cutting them in half because 50mg was too much and made me extra groggy the next day. It also messes with my memory. Rn I’m taking even smaller portions so that I’m only taking 1/4 of it, so roughly 12.5 mg a night. It still makes me groggy the next morning, but at least I’m getting my sleep.

Now to cover my PAWs experiences so far. The anxiety isn’t too bad. It’s there but not too overwhelming. The depression however... that’s another story. I’d already struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts before I started phenibut, but it had been so long since I’d been genuinely depressed that I almost forgot what it felt like. I don’t know how much of it is from the PAWs or the already existing mental illness. I do have ways to manage it. If I do daily exercises, especially cardio, it can help alleviate the depression a bit. However, getting up out of bed and actually getting myself to do any sort of exercise is a struggle. Ugh idk. This just sucks. Today I’m planning on going to the gym and going to my best friend’s place to play some games will help. I can’t wait for this shit to be over with.",3

Hi, I'm just really looking for some advice. I don't personally use phenibut or any other drugs, so I know next to nothing when it comes to drug and supplement info, (please don't make fun of me, I'm /really/ dumb on this kind of stuff, anything I know is from research) but my boyfriend is currently in the ER after quitting CT. He told me he was taking about 4gpd for about 4 months (I'm not exact on the timeline because I think this started due to some caffeine pills he was taking that he found out had phenibut in them) and then maybe for like two and a half weeks around the 21st of December, he jumped up to around 14-16gpd because he tested positive for covid, which has been his biggest anxiety inducer of 2020. I only have his word to go off of. He tried tapering for a few days, but it got to the point where even the smallest doses would send him into a very bad panic attack with 135+ heart rate, which could have been WDs? Instead of trying to find a dose that worked for him, he went straight to CT and went to the ER for his high anxiety. The last time he took any phen that I know of was on the 7th, and he only took about 3g to try and curb the WDs. He went to the ER multiple times but Saturday, the 9th, they admitted him only because he lied and said he wanted to kill himself. He was just really scared about what might happen, he had really bad anxiety even before using phenibut. He hasn't been able to contact me or his brother at all other than Saturday night, he said they let him have his phone just to tell us that he was stabilized and they were trying to find a mental facility with an open bed for him. Also before any of  his phenibut use, he was prescribed Zoloft (I don't know the dose) and Lyrica at 300mgx3/day as needed. So 900mg. While he was taking phen, he was only taking one of his Lyrica pills per day, but I don't know anything else right now. I don't know what meds they're giving him in the ER or what WDs he's experiencing right now, but I do know he told them it was a phenibut CT WD and tried to show them some articles on it. Hopefully they looked into it more.

What I'm most worried about is after he gets out. Of course I don't know if they'll have changed any of his medication around, so I'll just have to see when it happens, but should he talk to his doctor about slowly tapering off of Lyrica? Would Lyrica make his PAWS worse/last longer? Would Zoloft continue to help if he experiences any deep depression? What other, potentially non-addictive, substances could he take to help with PAWS and insomnia? (He just got out of inpatient rehab earlier 2020 for abusing benzos, so I'd love to try to avoid those. Kratom was his DOC and he's been on suboxone and away from Kratom for almost two years, so I'd like to avoid that too.) I've heard about stuff like Agmatine, Magnesium Glycinate, Melatonin, and L-Theanine, but I don't know much about those things or how/if they would interact with any meds he's on or if they can potentially be addictive or cause harm if he takes too much. So what's the dosing for those like? Any and all info on those would help me so much! Could he talk to his doctor about those substances as well? If he gets cravings for phenibut again for any reason, what things help deter those thoughts? And in general, what could I do that would support him? I know I'm going to try to get him to be more active because he's currently out of a job and has just  been sitting around the house all day with nothing to do but listen to his own thoughts. I work a lot in the mornings so the evenings are really the only times I get to spend with him and by then it's usually dark outside and extra cold, so we aren't able to go on walks together right now. I did buy him a game though, but I'm worried he won't even feel motivated enough to play it. He has stuff to watch on his laptop too and I got him a plant to take care of. We named the plant Dumpling, so I hope that makes it mean more to him and hopefully motivates him to continue to care for it. Just something small to do. I don't want him to fall back into addiction with another substance or really hurt himself while I'm not there.

Oh and another question I had, is there any possible way to know how long the acute WDs could last even though I don't know what they're doing for him at the ER? I was thinking around maybe two weeks at the most, only based off of other info I've read on this subreddit. I'm just wondering when he'll be able to contact me again to let me know what's going on. When he went in, he was having auditory hallucinations and was seeing stuff move even though it wasn't actually moving. I'm nervous he might experience psychosis, but I know he'll be somewhere where they can take care of him if that happens. 

Please give me any advice you have on suggestions I could make to him or how I could help! I also have anxiety and I've been over thinking this. I'm terrified for him.

&#x200B;

**Update:** As I'm writing this, I found out he had been sent to the Chicago Behavioral Hospital. I'm not sure how long he'll be there, I haven't been able to contact him yet, but maybe they'll be able to either provide him with or help him find mental health outpatient treatments when he gets out that would help with any depression and anxiety from PAWS? I'll also try contacting him later tonight, they gave me the number to get to his room. I've read that PAWS can last up to or over a year in some cases, especially with CT, and I'm also still worried about his Lyrica script. Thanks for any help and advice!",2

Prior to this i had a 2 week break and used to take twice a week.  

31 dec. - 2g  
2nd jan. - 2.5g  
3rd jan. - 1.4g  
5th jan. - 1.2g  
6th jan - 2g  
At this point i realized that i fucked up and might wanna taper off instead of quitting cold turkey.  

8th jan. - 800mg  
9th jan. - 600mg  
10th jan. 400mg

Where do you guys think i should go from here? Would it be OK to stop now or should i keep tapering?

For a whole year I have been using it pretty respectfully never more than 4 grams a week, never more than 2 grams a day mostly in the 1.5 range. Since like june 2020 I have let the habit take over and used it 3 or 4 times a week but never over 2 grams. I also started a kratom addiction since September 2019 but Since New year 2020 I am clean of Kratom. I don't have any cravings or such anymore. I used Phenibut a whole week 2gpd to counteract the kratomwithdrawals. So now I decided to stop taking phen. The longest I have gone without phen was 3 days recently while I was still taking kratom and the worst I've felt was a biz shakiness and insomnia. Now that I want to quit I tapered down from 1.5 to 0.5 every day 0.1g less. While tapering I bought some Kava which helps with anxiety and sleep I guess. My question here is even though I tapered down to 0.5g and that pretty rapidly I don't recall any withdrawal symptoms other than a little bit anxiety and a bit insomnia which the kava seems to be handling pretty good. Will I experience major withdrawal when I stop ct from 0.5g now?

Habit 2: Kiss The Wave

The great preacher Charles Spur­geon, who suffered from depression and anxiety, said, “I have learned to kiss the wave that throws me against the Rock of Ages.” That is easier said than done, no doubt. But that is how spiritual growth happens. 

A few years ago, my wife, Lora, was diagnosed with cancer. Not long after, she came across a question in a piece of poetry: what have you come to teach me? It’s a difficult question to ask, but the answer might revolutionize your life! 

There is a God who can rebuke the wind and the waves with these words: “Peace, be still.” But before you rebuke the storm, you need to accept it. You can’t move past the pain if you ignore it or hide it or deny it. You have to confront the brutal facts with unwavering faith. 

Our ability to remember the past is a gift from God, but it comes with a caveat. We don’t always remember accurately. This fact reminds us that memory is both selective and subjective. As such, it can be a blessing and a curse. When we remember yesterday the wrong way, we live a lie. And living a lie undermines our ability to win the day. 

Sometimes we misremember—or try to forget—because the past can be incredibly painful. That’s where the second habit—kiss the wave—comes into play. You’ve got to own the past, or the past will own you. 

How? You have to accurately inventory your past, hiding from nothing. Then you have to own all of it—the good, the bad, and the ugly. It is what it is. Or maybe I should say, it is what it was. You may not be re­sponsible for what happened, but you are response-able. 

Two people can encounter the same obstacle—a difficult diagno­sis, a bitter divorce, or even the death of a loved one—yet come out on the other side, very different people. One person owns his or her pain, while the other person is owned by it. One person becomes better, while the other person becomes bitter. 

The difference? You’ve got to kiss the wave that throws you against the Rock of Ages. You’ve got to come to terms with the pain that has made you who you are.

It’s time to kiss the wave!

Think on this: The obstacle is not the enemy; the obstacle is the way.",4

First post. Need to get this off my chest and see what the community has to say. Any and all feedback is welcome. 

&#x200B;

So I discovered phenibut in grad school. It's been my crutch ever since. My graduate presentation on CoQ10 and heart failure blew my professors and fellow students away, and I never looked back, until now. I have always been a bit of an anxious person, had some health issues that led to some neurosis over life, and poor self esteem, always second guessing myself, etc. Phenibut erased that, and allowed me to live the way, I think, many do without the added anxiety. Started at about 1g, 2x/wk. Fast forward 10+ years, much professional success (possibly thanks to phen) and I am at \~6g 3x/wk. If I am partying with friends or a special occasion occurs and I want that extra edge, Ill take it an extra day that week so occasionally it will be 4x/wk. But then I revert back to my 3x/wk. Honestly I just assumed, and was OK with, that I'd be on this for the rest of my life. There are the occasional tough days, like for me, once a week I go 2 full days without. That second day without can be (but isn't always) hairy. I may be over anxious and just try and move through the day checking boxes to get to the next day where I'll be on another dose of phenibut and feel normal/ideal again. But it's obviously tolerable, as I've been at this for over a decade. I will add that, like so many others, I also use kratom. Started about the same time, in grad school after a motorcycle accident. So >10 years of daily kratom use as well (took a month or 2 off throughout that time just to test the WDs, which were tolerable). I use kratom only once daily, in the evenings after work. With the 2 of these I have been told I seem happier and more content. I'm not sure I agree 100%, but compared to my previous iteration of an alcoholic on prescription SSRIs & benzos +Wellbutrin, I admit to feeling much more human, and likely appear more so as well. 

There is always much more to it, but thats all that I think is pertinent regarding the purpose of this post. 

&#x200B;

Over New Years in S FL, my friends family and I got together from some good times ands enjoyed more than our usual use of phenibut. He also has been sitting on some Clonazolam that I introduced him to years ago. I may use this once or twice a year, only special occasions. About 1 or 2 days after this, I woke in the AM and noticed both legs, from knee down, were uncomfortable numb feeling. I had a difficult time walking, and after a few minutes of being freaked out, they began to hurt. I have experienced numerous surgeries and motorcycle wrecks, but this was the most painful thing I have EVER experienced.  It lasted for about 30 mins, and my kids were crying and my wife was ready to either take me to the ER or call an ambulance. Eventually my R foot improved, and my left came around shortly after. 

This rightly terrified me. Ironically, 2 days prior, I suffered  my first Visual Migraine. I'm not sure if they are related or not, but figured it's worth mentioning. As my eyesight worsened, it scared me so much I had an RN at work check my BP and I was up to 160/90, which I've never been that high (outside of working out). Apparently visual migraines are not worrisome in and of themselves. My eyesight corrected after 30 mins or so. 

&#x200B;

So I decided to look into the numb leg thing and phenibut. It seems this isn't uncommon. Although most only report numbness, pins and needles, which mine did feel very similar to, but had the addition of the worst ache/burning/pain ever. The pain was so bad that I am willing to give up phenibut altogether if it actually is the cause. Regardless, I'd like any and all input on my plan, which is tentative and as follows:

&#x200B;

* Today is one of my 3 days a week I use Phenibut. (Usually, Monday, Thursday & Saturday)
* I never measured exactly before (which is how it creeped up from 1 gram to 6), but I've had this old mg scale for RCs for years. I dusted it off and went with 5.8 grams in the AM right before a work out. 
* Each time i use phenibut, i will decrease by 100mg. So on my next dose (Monday) I will measure 5.7 grams, titrating down thusly. 
* I also will increase my meditation to at least every other day. 
* My diet is good but I will continue with minimal meat (mostly fish/vegetarian proteins) and minimal processed foods. 
* I will set up an appt with psych, discuss my self medication and why, and my goals. I will take CBT seriously this time. 
* If baclophen is recommended will follow guidance and titration of psych.
* I am also using a little biofeedback
   * my 2 day off pehn BP this AM is usually on the high side of my normal (125-135 sys). After phenibut today its down to 105-115 sys.
* I have Valerian root & Melatonin to help when sleeping becomes an issue. Other supplements? I enjoy Kava but only when using phen, ironically 
* I have also ordered Agmatine & N-Acetyl L-Cysteine
   * The doses I have read, but uncertain if this is daily, only days when using phenibut or on non-phenibut days (I understand many people use it daily so this question may be an unknown)
   * Agmatine: 1000mg 1-3x daily
   * NAC: 600mg-1200mg daily
* Also any thoughts/experience Re: Amitriptyline? I did not respond well to any SSRI, but have read this may be beneficial for some",3

I’m going to be 35 this year in July, my kids have aged 5 years since I began Phenibut. My marriage has been dragged through hell and back out of it (stronger thank God) but it’s a deep somber feeling of, most of my interactions, victories, acquaintances...was it really me or just a byproduct of a substance? I’ve noticed as I’ve begun to “sober” up I can actually think deeper and have more meaningful conversations and not shallow back and forths. While I’m thankful for this my agitation kicks in and kicks me back out of the deep conversation 😂 figured I’d ask you guys if this is common, also I know this is part of the process but I have this fear of being fired or my wife leaving me.

I was taking Kratom for 5 years, and recently about 2 months ago I started taking phenibut.

My reason for that was, I was going Concrete work, and I have been doing it the past 3 years, I was working for a very intense angry bi polar boss, he would put all kinds of pressure on me, and would yell at me for any little thing. 

When I was working there I was doing better then I ever was in my hole life, I was making more money then ever and I was always 20 minutes early for work, I was the guy you could count on.

Well fast forward a couple months the work was getting way more intense and the hours were getting way longer.

I started to get to were every Sunday I could not sleep at all. I would toss and turn each night,  and I would have so much anxiety, about going to work, and then I started to worry about not getting sleep, and it was an endless loop, every Sunday I would not be able to sleep, I never really had such a big problem with Insomina but I really started to notice it starting to develope at 25.

So ended up loosing my job, I got tired of never being able to sleep on sundays and going to work on Monday pulling an all nighter. It was horrible, and laying there every night tossing and turning not being able to sleep gave me a really helpless feeling.

So I ended up getting a more easy going job, and then 

I Decided to order some Phenibut! At first it would help me fall asleep, but then I couldn't fall asleep at all anymore and out of frustration I began taking more and more everyday because I had to sleep and I thought it would help me sleep. 

Well turns out it would start doing the opposite, but I didn't know it at the time. I thought it was just my insomnia.

I ended up loosing that job to work on myself.

I quit kratom cold Turkey,  and I am now trying to taper off the Phenibut.

I'm at 3.2 grams at night and 1 gram in the morning, but the problem is, I can only sleep a couple hours a night and a lot of times I cant sleep at all, one time I stayed up 5 days because I couldn't sleep, well it was the phenibut that was doing that, I know that now, and I desperately want to get off of it, it's pretty scary. 


Last night I tried to drop my night dose down from 3.2 grams to 2.5 and 2 hours later my hole body started to shake , and I felt like I was literally about to have a seizure, it scared me. I jumped out of bed and took another gram and it went away in 10 minutes. I was worried if I had a seizure I could black out and nobody would know that I'm having a seizure because my girlfriend fell asleep on the couch and I haven't told her yet about my addiction. 

I'm going to try to drop 100mg every 2 days but seriously I feel like I'm trapped, I cant work because I cant sleep at all or if I do only for a couple hours and then I'll wake up at 9am every morning. And a lot of my hair is falling out, probably because I'm not sleeping and my body dosent get the rest it needs.

I went to a doctor and he gave me 20 librium pills and a once week taper for it, but I know if I did that I'd definitely have a seizure, so I'm going to try to drop 100mgs every 2 days.

But I had to speak on this it feels good telling someone, I didn't think I'd ever be like this,  it sucks because I dont want to take it but if I just stop itll be very bad for me. And being up for days and not being able to work and feeling like shit everyday because of it is making me incredibly depresed, god I just wanna be sober.

It took me 5 years to quit taking kratom, I was taking 6 spoons a serving 6 times a day.

I'm aware I have a drug problem and I want to change it.
I cant keep living with this negativity. I want to feel normal again.


(Update, I've been taking Phenibut for 3 months, and I dont think I was going to have a seizure now, I have been up for a few days and smoking a bowl made me trip out a little bit and made me think I was going to have a seizure.)",9
2021-01-07 20:17:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ksrrh6/binged_for_10_days_ct_day_5/,"Binged for 10 days, CT day 5","Holidays were particularly stressful this year and I abused the fuck out of phenibut. I started out with 1.5g per day but quickly worked up to ~4g per day. While doing this, I also drank nearly every night (not to obliteration or passing out) and took significant amounts of Dexedrine (20-40mg per day). 

Well, I decided to go the cold turkey route since I'm currently on work leave and I'm currently on day 5. The physical acute symptoms (shakiness, brain zaps, muscle twitching, tinnitus) have subsided for the most part but what has remained are these horrific psychological symptoms. Over the past 3 days, I've tormented myself by thinking about every bad thing that has happened to me and what will happen to me. Every time I've embarrassed myself is being relived. My goals are seeming more and more out of reach. At times, I believe there's nothing left to look forward to. I see the worst in myself and in others. Needless to say, these thoughts are destabilizing though are gradually improving. Day 3 was far the worst, day 4 I thought I was getting better, but feel a little worse today, day 5. 

I'm connected with reality and believe I'm on the tail end of this by now. Anxiety fluctuates from extreme to sometimes mild and the insomnia only allows me to sleep anywhere between 3 and 5 hours a night if I'm lucky with plenty of disruptions. I know I was digging myself into a hole, but I didn't expect the psychological symptoms to be so harsh. If I had to label it, it feels like I'm going through depressive realism, like I'm finally confronted with my current situation in all my inadequacies. 

Hope to improve soon.




**Update**

Day 6: Felt wired last night so took a sleep inducing cocktail of melatonin, diphenhydramine, and a muscle relaxer and fell asleep eventually for around 5-6ish hours with at least 2 disruptions throughout the night. Didn't feel well waking up this morning. I'm still experiencing cold intolerance, in my extremities primarily, and felt achy and just out of it. Brain fog is still ever-present. 

However, I did not wake up with feelings of existential dread like I did on days 2-5, or at least that has diminished to a great extent. I did have one moment where I caught myself attempting to rationalize taking a small dose (I didn't). Oddly enough, the craving occurred when I thought about my wife and my date night tonight. During withdrawal I feel like I'm not ""there"" and can't contribute to a good time.

2021-01-07 10:27:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ksfh9s/my_breakup_with_phenibut_faa/,My breakup with phenibut FAA,"I started dosing with phenibut back in early October 2020. I have been using medical marijuana for anxiety for the last several years, but due to a new job I was subject to a drug test. Looking into alternative options I discovered phenibut. I do not take any prescription drugs other than mmj. I started at doses of .5 grams and worked my way up to a max of 4 g bi weekly. I found that 3g was the threshold where I felt the desired effect. I’m 6ft 3 and 210 pounds. I dropped my dosage to once a week and never really had any withdrawal effects. Instead of taking my dose sublingually I began putting the FAA powder in a half gallon of water and drank it throughout the day.  By the time the end of December rolled around my 3 g dose still gave me the desired effect but was making me slightly nauseous I would say 3 or 4 out of 10. I decided it was time to take a break from phenibut. My drug test came two months late but was finally over so I was able to start dosing when mmj again. Fast forward two weeks and I’m feeling great without any phenibut. Anxiety solved. For the first time I decided to take phenibut recreationally. This was a terrible idea. I was already feeling the best I had in months. I even thought long and hard about taking it. I remember saying to myself “I already feel good, what’s the point.” For whatever reason I mixed my 3.5 gram dose in my half gallon of water. I got busy at work and was not able to eat lunch that day. The desired effects were coming in and I felt great. That afternoon the severe nausea hit. 10/10. I was dry heaving and kept nodding off at work. When I got home at 4 pm I passed out. My wife got home from work at 6 pm to find me asleep on the couch in a strange position. She was concerned because I never nap or fall asleep during the day. She woke me up and I rushed straight to the restroom. Things were flowing from both ends, followed by 20 minutes of dry heaving. I go straight to bed and wake up the next morning after 14 hours of sleep. I’m forced to call off work for the first time ever due to a illness, which raised immediate concerns at my office for covid 19. I had to admit to them that I knew I ate something bad as an excuse. The whole entire day I was sick to my stomach with 8 out of 10 nausea. My energy was awful. It took me until 4 pm to get out of bed. I slept an additional 3 hours. The rest of the day I spent on the couch. When I got up to use the restroom I would be dizzy and slightly disoriented. My shoulders bumped into a wall a couple of times when turning a corner. I drank 1.5 gallons of water throughout the day. I went back to bed around 11 pm with nausea still a 4 out of 10. I woke up to my alarm the next morning(today) still a 3 out of 10 nausea and very tired. I’m about 5 minutes away from clocking into work. I will be throwing away my lift mode phenibut it is the 200g container and is about 3/4 full. I’ll never touch the stuff ever again. Thank god for mmj! I hope someone can take my experience as a good warning. Please use responsibly!",3

2021-01-06 23:51:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ks5zat/cold_turkey_or_taper/,Cold Turkey or Taper?,"Hey guys,

I fell into the phenibut trap slowly but surely. In November I got 18 grams worth in capsule form, taking 1.5 gs once every 3-4 days. Then 2 grams here and there. Ran out after about a month and a half of 1.5g once every other day doses, then decided to order another on December 27th.

Got another bottle but I was at the point where I was 1.5g every other day. December 29, December 31st, and January 2nd. I stopped taking it because I needed a break. However I got pretty bad WD's (didnt realize drinking exacerbated these) - horrible dread anxiety, pacing, dry mouth, heart rate, the works. I didn't realize it, but I dug myself in a hole. This is the first time I've gone 4-5 days without Phen in about a month.

I white knuckled it from Jan 3rd until Jan 6th (tonight). I drank and smoked tonight, not realizing that this exacerbates things. It got really bad. So I took 500 mg to take the edge off, and it's definitely helping make things less constant and more bearable. Trying L-Theanine and CBD too. But still, the dread creeps in and I'm worried.

My ultimate question is: did I almost get out of the CT hell and broke like an idiot? Or would a taper be much more advisable because it would have lasted much longer? I never have done daily dosing. I can't find any use cases with my dosage and schedule.

Also, does the SEVERE anxiety last a while after a taper? I want to try to make the acute symptoms go away smoothly.

Thank you all",1

(Withdrawal horror story),"As someone who has been using phenibut off and on since December 2018 taking anywhere from a month long break to a 6 month long break i never went through withdrawals such as this. Let me make this clear. i have never been able to skip a dose on phenibut. If i get a bottle of phenibut i will use it every day until it is gone and attempt a fast taper when i know i am running out and the effects stop working. I would experience moderate withdrawal and if need be use kratom to keep myself in a ""Calm"" state.  With the current state of world affairs right now and lack of things to do, paired with my already existing anxiety disorder and a stressful wage slave job where i am essentially treated like cattle. I thought it best to order some more phenibut to ease my mental torment. Every day, sometimes more than once per day i would jam down atleast 2.5 - 3.5 grams of this chemical.  With every binge i would end up maxing out at a ""sweet spot"" of just over 3 grams untill eventually i would get little to no benefit and rapid taper.

For reasons I won't bother explaining i am refusing to use kratom to ease the burden of phenibut withdrawal. Since this just leads me to getting addicted to kratom and then phenibut. An endless cycle. But the bad thing is that i had messed up my taper. while i was tapering at 600mg i had decided to take 3.5 grams (All the remaining phen left in my bottle) because i thought i was pretty much in the clear anyway and wanted to have a last hoorah... mistake

Well here is the thing. I was not tapering properly at all and would take double or triple doses sporadically through the day. So it wasn't really a ""taper"" at all. Just something to make me feel at ease with my addiction.

So here i am now. 6 days from my last dose and i have not slept in 3 days and feel like i could have a stroke or a heart attack or seizure at any moment. I won't check into a hospital because i have no healthcare and it most likely is just the gaba induced anxiety. Luckily i searched my supplement cabinet up and down and managed to find two (600mg total) phenibut capsules that somehow got misplaced. I am feeling better now. Better enough to write this that is. For the people that are thinking about abusing phenibut please reconsider and do not do it every day. I now have to live with a laundry list of side effects that just might never go away all because i would not give my body a chance to heal itself between doses. Here are some of the side effects i am currently experiencing through withdrawal

1. Brain zaps
2. Heart palputations
3. electric tingling in hands and nerves
4. extreme paranioa (Everyone is out to get you) 
5. Insomnia (No sleep all week.)
6. restless legs. (Moving legs every 3 seconds, uncontrollable urges) 
7. Auditory hallucinations. (Will hear conversations that are not there, hear sounds out of your window) hard to distinguish reality from your own imagination.
8. no appatite (Wont eat all day. maybe a snack or two)
9. tinnitus (loud ringing, humming, thumping sounds coming from the ear) 
10. Zero energy or motivation to do anything. (Spend all day in your bed thinking you are going to die

Thank you for reading this. Please remember to follow the instructions given on the label and not to take things as a joke. Addiction and dependency is serious especially when dealing with gaba related drugs. Hopefully the 600mg of phen i took previously will earn me some sleep this time. good night.",19

See the wikipedia entry:

In Italy, the gold standard for treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine dependency is 8–10 days of low-dose, slowly infused flumazenil.[12] One addiction treatment centre in Italy has used flumazenil to treat over 300 patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (up to 70 times higher than conventionally prescribed) with physicians being among the clinic's most common patients.[13]

Epileptic patients who have become tolerant to the anti-seizure effects of the benzodiazepine clonazepam became seizure-free for several days after treatment with 1.5 mg of flumazenil.[14] Similarly, patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (median dosage 333 mg diazepam-equivalent) were able to be stabilised on a low dose of clonazepam after 7–8 days of treatment with flumazenil.[15]

Flumazenil has been tested against placebo in benzo-dependent subjects. Results showed that typical benzodiazepine withdrawal effects were reversed with few to no symptoms.[16] Flumazenil was also shown to produce significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than saline in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with benzodiazepine-dependent subjects. Additionally, relapse rates were much lower during subsequent follow-up.[17]

In vitro studies of tissue cultured cell lines have shown that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhanced the benzodiazepine binding site where such receptors have become more numerous and uncoupling/down-regulation of GABAA has been reversed.[18][19][20] After long-term exposure to benzodiazepines, GABAA receptors become down-regulated and uncoupled. Growth of new receptors and recoupling after prolonged flumazenil exposure has also been observed. It is thought this may be due to increased synthesis of receptor proteins.[21]

Flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4–266 weeks.[22] This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.

Low-dose, slow subcutaneous flumazenil administration is a safe procedure for patients withdrawing from long-term, high-dose benzodiazepine dependency.[23] It has a low risk of seizures even amongst those who have experienced convulsions when previously attempting benzodiazepine withdrawal.[24]

It was like a magic potion in a bottle for me! I used heroin for 16 years and have been clean for almost 4 years now. I was still struggling with anxiety and depression and ADD and coping with everything with no meds whatsoever. I am married with 4 kids ages 15, 6, 2, and 1. I found out a couple months ago im pregnant again. About this same time the sleepwalkers got pulled and the ingredients changed removing the phenibut. This is how I found out about withdrawal. The drink no longer helped and when the second day without came I was a complete ball of anger and rage and in my mind my entire life was shit and I hated everyone and everything and didn't know why. I became very mean to my family and didn't even want my kids around me. I knew something was really wrong bc thats not me at all. Once I figured out it was the phenibut I had to start driving 35 mins to a place that still sold the drin#ryh&ks with it in them. I had been drinking 3, sometimes 4 a day so the withdrawal was hell. It was worse than when I was sick from heroin withdrawal and worse than methadone withdrawal. I finally got to where 1 or 2 a day kept me from reaching that level of being totally psychotic. But then I found out I 0was pregnant and knew what that withdrawal felt like, I knew I had to taper slowly and stop. I ordered a couple bottles of phenubut online.

I take 1 gram in the morning and 3 grams at night, if I can cap it down to just take enough to feel normal and not feel withdrawals,  so let's say I take 1 gram in the morning and 2 or 2.5 at night and then take my trazadone, do you think I'd be able to fall asleep again normally, and then shave off 100mg every 2 days till I'm off the stuff, I seriously wanna get off this stuff,  I messed up big time by getting it, I know what I did was my fault, I'm not blaming the phenibut.

2021-01-04 20:29:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/kqna4s/quitting_again/,Quitting AGAIN...,"Hello

So 2 years ago i quit phenibut. I used for a couple years but it was probably 3-4 months that it was daily or every other day. I jumped at 1.5g and was using it every other day at that point. It was a rough week and then a month or two till I felt fully emotionally stable.

Now I’ve been using for 3 months. Quickly went to daily. The worst of it was 2 weeks daily 3-4.5g. Now for about a month I’ve been taking it every other day (2-2.5g) was pretty easy to get to that point. So I’m wondering if it’s probably best I just do a quick taper every other day and then jump? I feel like if I do a slow taper I’ll just end up using it longer and messing up my receptors even more. Am I in deep enough where doing a quick taper and jumping would be a bad idea?

I have fascoracetam that I’ve been using on the off days to help and Kratom (want to be very careful with that). I also have ashwaganda, b vitamins, Shilajil, skate liver oil (omega fats), melatonin, kava and indica edibles. Slow tapers are usually really hard for me do to the self control needed. 

So I’m thinking keep doing every other day. I was planning on taking 0.8g in a little. Took 1 gram an hour ago and have some more arriving in the mail today that I’m using to help ween down. Then take tomorrow off and then the next day 1.6g and then the follow off or maybe just a 0.5g before bed to help with sleep. And then maybe stabilize at 1.6g or drop even more. I’m okay having some WD symptoms during the taper but want to at least get down to a gram or a little less and just jump. I just want out of this and heal quick and not drag it on. 

Sorry this is a little all over the place. My brain is pretty foggy and all over. Open to thoughts and suggestions. Also anyone use agmatine? I’ve seen it brought up quite a bit.",3

Have a couple ""tools"" to help me out. What's my best strategy here?","So, back in November, I managed to get sober for a month after about 9 months of addiction. Unfortunately, the incredibly stressful work environment during the holiday season lead me to relapse. At first it was ""I'll just take it for a day or two and then drop it"", which turned into ""I just need to make it through this week"", which turned into ""Well, now that I have some time off, I'll take some so I can actually enjoy myself for a little bit"" and before I knew it, I was 3-4 weeks into a relapse.

Yesterday, due to UPS being incredibly late with my Liftmode order due to some serious winter storms here in the upper-midwest, I ran completely out of phenibut. At that point, I decided ""Alright, I'm gonna need to nip this at the bud before it gets any more out of control"". 

Originally, my plan was to just c/t using benzos as needed and just pray to God that I didn't enter psychosis territory. Miraculously, though, the baclofen I ordered over a month ago came in the mail today of all days. I'm literally ecstatic, this is the PERFECT timing for it to come in. 

The only problem is, I only ordered 50 10mg tablets. That's nowhere near enough to do a proper taper, so I'm gonna have to c/t either way. 

What so you guys think my best approach here would be? I was taking 7-8g of phenibut a day for 3 or 4 weeks. I could take 70mg of baclofen a day, but that would only get me through a week. So, that would get me through the worst of the acute withdrawals, but then what happens when I go off the baclofen c/t immediately afterwards? Am I gonna get any kind of withdrawal symptoms dropping the baclofen with no taper only a week after quitting phenibut c/t? Is there a better approach I can take here?

I have:

-50 10mg baclofen tablets

-Roughly ~75 or so mg of liquid etizolam

-NAC

-Memantine

-Gabapentin (I've been taking gabapentin daily for over a year, so I don't think it's gonna do much)

Any advice on what my best approach here would be is greatly appreciated!",2

2021-01-02 21:02:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/kpb60y/life_after_phenibut/,Life after Phenibut,"I will be going to a detox facility on the 5th to get off phenibut. I’ve been taking daily for 7 months. Recently it’s gotten up to 12 GPD. 

How long til I feel back to normal? I really don’t wanna rely on this substance to feel happy or comfortable in my own skin.

I am already dreading how miserable this week-long experience might be. But I’m even more scared for how I’m gonna be feeling after.

I’ve read a lot on this sub about how a lot of people’s anxiety is better after they got off Phenibut than when they were on it. Can I expect this?

What can I expect at the detox center if they don’t give me Baclofen? They’re also treating me for Kratom dependence too. 

I know the week-long detox is just the start, and the real journey begins when I get home from there.

My addict brain is already contemplating if I should save 50 capsules for when I get home just to make sure I’m not totally miserable? I know this would just be reversing any progress I’ve already made .

Any advice, any do’s and don’t’s , any words of wisdom for leading up to the detox and for when I get out would mean the world to me!!

Any stories of hope, and positivity would be appreciated as well. 

Please, tell it all in the comments.

I’m really struggling right now. 

MUCH LOVE guys . Happy New Years 💚💚",17

A. Is this sustainable or should I just let it go and make peace with it? It’s usually led me back to Kratom. 

B. What should i brace for wd and anxiety wise after 3 days use? I kinda know but I also have short term memory and I’m already feeling pretty panicky. 

Apologies if this question offends anyone. Thanks",3

I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing is depression or not becUse it's different from other times I've been depressed. Other times I've barely been able to function and get out of bed and I cried alot. This time, I'm functioning normal, feel sad but not despairing, can still enjoy things but the thing I'm struggling with is connections with other people. I dont feel connected to anyone, not even my bf. I dont even know if I love him anymore. I also have zero sex drive and I dont even think about sex anymore, in fact the thought makes me feel kind of sick. I feel almost asexual. I feel very alone but unable to feel comforted by other people, so I just feel dead inside. I cant cry, I dont really feel much emotion atall. Is this a symptom of coming off phenibut? Is this depression? Life just doesnt seem worth living this way.",11

I have tried it first time previous friday and second time at sunday (2 days after) both times 500mg on empty stomach with some diet coke. When it kicked in the first time i loved it, same as second time, i was listening to music whole day, loved to speak with people, was so emotional that i could cry listening to certain songs, regarding training pretty crazy too, i was so restless second time i have used it that when i ve came from gym i ate some food waited couple hours and went back to gym second time cuz i was so energized in combination with some coffee. But the problems started at monday morning after i was about to go to sleep and smoked pretty big joint right before bed as i couldn't fall asleep. I was feeling kinda poisoned which could be dehydration as i drank barely no water even though i exercised twice that day (but drank like 3 huge coffees which are diuretic), but lets leave this as this does not bother me that much as days were passing and i still have basically withdrawal symptoms, i could not breath at night, i had feeling like i was about to faint few times, was nauseas, had low blood pressure, drowsiness, delirium at some points, chest tightness, fast heart rate, some muscle cramps (which ok could be dehydration as well) but sensitivity to light and sound? Just crazy scary and i just want to remind u i took it twice with both time what is considered low dose (500mg), comparing to seeing people taking like multiple grams this all is pretty scary. I would really love to see what the f could be wrong here, because the thing itself is amazing but what was the reason of all that happened to me? In advance thanks for answers.

Happy new year!",3
