Over the past two or three weeks I went on a binge and was not even tracking my doses.  I’m sure some days exceeded 10 g.   I’m ready to taper and stabilize (what does that even mean?)  should I start with a couple of doses divided up in the day at what 2 or 3 g?  It’s been about 30 hours since I dosed any.  I do have some agmatine and have heard you talk about using that too. Would be interested in any other natural supplements that will ease what is sure to be a rough go.  I have 300mg capsules and so that is what I will be jumping down from on any given reductions.  Thanks in advance.

UPDATE 4/30 day 3
Day 1 I ended up with a starting dose of 7.5 g.  Remember, I have no baseline since I wasn’t keeping track.  I took that in 3 different doses. 
On day 2 I started to taper with assistance from Agmatine.  I was able to drop my doses by 2 g.  I feel fine.  My goal today is to drop by another 1g.",1

I hate waking up everyday and that being the first thing I do. I have quit a 2 year benzo addiction before but with the help of in patient treatment. 

I have read about baclofen in this sub and it seems to be the best choice to move forward with in order to get out of this phenibut situation. I ordered some baclofen from alldaychemist back in mid March and still have not received it. Checked the tracking on the package and it appears it arrived in the US on April 18th but still do not have it, so I am a little worried that the package has been lost or something. Where is the best place to get baclofen besides going to ask a doctor? I am worried about that route and the recommendation of treatment or them just not knowing what the drug is. 

As for when I do get the baclofen, what is the best way to taper? Like I said I take 6-8gpd and it’s usually right away when I wake up and I occasionally take a small dose later in the day.

I’ve made it thru the acute WD, and I’ve even started sleeping normally again. 

I’ve been focusing solely on quitting for so long that I didn’t even think about the boredom/apathy that I would experience even long after my acute WD was over, or how difficult it might be to return to a “normal” state of mind. 

Even tho I’m off of phenibut completely and feel infinitely better than I did when I was on it, I’m really struggling to find stuff interesting or fun to do.
Most of the time, I feel like I’m drifting thru my days trying to pass the time so that maybe tomorrow I’ll wake up and actually feel like myself again. 

It took more mental strength and perseverance than I ever thought I was capable of to get this far. Which is why this feels so anticlimactic and frustrating. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? Does anyone have advice for how to get thru this period of depression?

Side note: I don’t want this to be discouraging to anyone currently quitting and going thru withdrawals. I feel much healthier and overall fantastic compared to how I felt when I was dependent on phenibut. It is 100 percent worth the investment of time and effort to taper off. I suppose that what I’m experiencing now is just the next step toward full recovery.",6

I just woke up from one where my father had convinced all of us to play a video game together where you cannot log out and you cannot die, otherwise you die in real life. 

I am only able to sleep for about an hour each time. And each dream is so real. I have had one pleasant one. And the rest were just awful.

definitely thinking about trying to CT this shit since I’m only at .6-1g a day for roughly 2 weeks. 
Never taken more than .5 at a time.

The only reason I even was taking it daily is because I had been marketed capsules as a “Kratom replacement” but they had Phenibut and Tianeptine in them. I took them daily for a few months. And I tried to CT them. But I kept having massive panic attacks, and my heart rate spiked to 300 briefly in a few of them.

So I have been taking just enough to not have the WDs. Like I said. Maybe .3 in the morning and .3 at night. I did mess up the first few days because The company that manufactures these capsules straight up lied to me about how much Phenibut is in them. So I am massively over dosed myself for 3 days(6~gpd) I stayed off of it for three days, and then the panic attacks started. Since then I have maintained at my low dose and only hit WDs here and there. 

Yes. I know I am an idiot for taking something that I wasn’t 100% sure what was in it. I am also an idiot for believing a shady company. And, I am an idiot for not realizing I over dosed the first day. 

I just need advice. Please...be nice. I have been beating myself up entirely too much over this. 


The Tianeptine also isn’t an issue persay. This is not my first time tapering off of it. And I am stable on 80% of my original dose. Slowly dropping each week, just like I did last time.",2

 My main issue is the sleep, I’m lucky if I get 2 hours and I’m on day 10, my doctor gave me klonopin for the sleep but I decided I just wanted to white knuckle it out and get clean and off this stuff for good.

 Anyways mainly at mild anxiety during the day not much depression anymore and have finally got to the point of being able to eat 3 meals and maybe a snack.

2020-04-20 19:06:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/g53itc/so_i_have_a_baclofen_script_what_now/,"So I have a Baclofen script, what now?","To preface this, I began taking Phenibut in January. I immediately made several mistakes. From day 1, I used Phenibut every day, starting with taking a small scoop, and then making capsules. Then, because I also take kratom every 4 hours, I started taking a capsule of Phenibut every 4 hours. At first I would just take 1, then I started taking 2, and then 3. With the intention of tapering, I bought a milligram scale and weighed the capsules, and realized I had worked my way up to a 12g/day habit. During my honeymoon period, phenibut was an absolute gamechanger. I already knew that I loved anything that modulated GABA-b, but phenibut was different. It made me the funniest guy in the room, the most interesting guy in the room, sex felt incredible, music had a new life to it...phenibut was perfect. Then I learned what a cruel joke that was.

2 weeks ago, I bought an unfamiliar batch of capsules on Amazon, started filling capsules with them, and after having taken them for 3 days, I realized I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I was confused, because I hadn't cut my dosage at all, the only thing I had changed was the brand of capsules. I decided to read reviews, and sure enough, they weren't dissolving. So, I had essentially tripped my way into a CT. The first couple nights, I slept decently well. Then, it really kicked in. Having read a litany of posts on this sub-reddit, I am not alone in experiencing this symptom, but it's incredibly disconcerting. Essentially, I'll be just in the grips of sleep, and my lungs just stop breathing, forcing me awake. Initially, this was followed by panic attacks, but knowing what's happening now, I just get pissed off. In the past week, it's progressed to me having hallucinations. My eyes will be closed, and I'm lying completely still, but I'm on my phone, scrolling through social media, reading things that aren't actually there. This has actually worked it's way into waking life, where I am actually having to question whether posts I remember are posts I've actually seen, or just saw while hallucinating. Also, though this has only happened 3 times, I've had *extremely* vivid CEVs (closed eye visuals), rivaling that of my previous experiences with DMT. I woke up one night and my pulse was pushing 180bpm, I was convinced I was about to have a heart attack. 

Anyways, this all lead me to get no more than 3 hours of sleep for just over 2 weeks now. Now, I have an Adderall script, so this wasn't an issue, and it kept me at work. However, because of the pandemic, my job is allowing people to leave until my state's shelter-in-place order, no questions asked. Previously, I decided to stick around, even working a fair amount of overtime, but then my stimulus money hit, and I decided to take off for awhile. 

I called my GP that day, explained my situation, and was able to to get a telehealth visit the next day. I explained my situation, educated him on phenibut, showed him the NCBI journal, and he gave me a script for Baclofen.

Now, he was only able to prescribe 80mg/day, that was the maximum. Once I titrate up to the full 20mg, how should I proceed with tapering the phenibut? How much faster than the standard 100mg/week can I go? Most of my concern lies with being able to sleep, and I would be taking 20mg of Baclofen 4 times a day, so should I save 2 of my doses for night time. Any help here would be massively appreciated. I have until the 30th to really get this under control, and then I return to work.

I fully expect this to be my first of many posts here (unfortunately), and I'm quite happy that a community exists that tackles this insidious ""nootropic"" together.

I had zero intense withdrawal effects. I should note that I'm also prescribed Suboxone as I work to get off of opioids (currently tapering that as well). I had some light sleep disturbances from dropping phenibut but no panick or real anxiety. I feel better during the day without it than I did with my 100mg. I stayed on 100mg for probably 60 days. If it makes you feel any better, dropping phenibut was a lot easier than opioids. Be glad you're not on Suboxone with that elephant to tackle after phenibut. Good luck all!",1

I had the worst experience coming off this stuff last year in May if you see my previous posts.  I have had prolonged withdrawal symptoms for the best part of a year and only at about 7 / 8 months did it start to properly ease up for me. The only thing that has remained is tinnitus. I was hoping that it wasn't permanent but since it hasn't gone yet, I am worried that it has done some kind of damage. Is this possible from phenibut? I have had tests done by a neurologist and all normal. Can't explain the persisting tinnitus though. 

If anyone is considering coming off this stuff cold turkey at high dose 4g+ and even switching to baclofen under no medical supervision, please taper instead. Your mood swings coming off this stuff  by tapering is nothing compared to depersonalization + long lasting physical issues this stuff caused me.  Even with the aid of baclofen.",12

And taking more only makes my symptoms worse.

I take or dose two times a day, and I take 1g agmatine with each dose. And I take 15 mg baclofen 3 times a day, and that only helps with the bad mood or anxiety that I experience, not with my sleep problem. 

Can anyone please give any helpful advice on how I can sleep more than 2 hours at night.

I think the thing is that you need to stabilize on the same lower dose. If you take 8 grams pd and having glutamate surge, you should take 6 gpd until you stabilize, it took me 5 days to feel better. Do not try to take less and less. And just take the same lower dose until you feel better.",3

This is the first time I can really 'feel' the drop.  Weighing out these tiny amounts is really tedious work, lol.  I now weigh out 4 days worth of doses ahead of time because.....well, I don't like it.  


I am also quite shocked that such a paltry dose like this has so much effect.  I'm only dropping once a week now (started that last week).  I had some muscle tension the first few days last time, but this time seems a bit more?  


I guess my main question is.....did anyone actually reduce by even LESS than 50mg? also, how long did you stay at each new drop once you got so low and at which point did you just say ""f\*ck it--I'm done""?  


Once 100% off......were there any residual symptoms? maybe I'm just venting here,lol.  But I've started to fantasize about NEVER WEIGHING ANOTHER DOSE OF THIS SHIT.  I'm soooooo over it.  But since I've been tapering my last gram now for 9 weeks....I don't want to waste that.  


I really, really want to avoid PAWS and any prolonged anhedonia/lack of joy stuff.  My mood has been good this whole time with the exception of the day or two after drops, and even that has been pretty ok (I can smile and find humor and be humorous etc).  


HISTORY: 10 months averaging 2 grams a day (weird use though, lots of binges and other times a gram a day) this averaged 2 grams a day.  I'd been stuck at a gram a day (divided between 2 doses) for a long time feeling subpar and that's when I started the taper.

I made it to Friday somehow and took 1.8G in  mid afternoon and I felt amazing again. Sat I split that dose (about .85g at 1pm and another at 4pm) and that was tolerable although I believe my body was still in some sort of physical shock from the cold turkey.

Of course I still expect to feel symptoms, though I'm assume it's far easier than CT.

**Here's my phen story**: I started almost exactly 1 year ago, probably 2-3x per week at around **1g** (never taken it twice in one day.) Even after reading the horror stories, I still felt in control; that was a stupid thing to think. After about 3-4 months, my dosage escalated to **4g every other day**.

About a month ago, I've cut back my dosage from **4g** **to 3.25g** (still every other day.) I hadn't noticed any effects whatsoever, which I attributed to still being at such a high dose. **Starting maybe 1 week ago**, the nights when I'm not taking anything have turned into an absolute nightmare. Typical: extreme insomnia (while being exhausted,) restless leg syndrome acting up, panic, fear, etc.

I'm already 100% committed to tapering the proper way, and ridding myself of this shit forever.

**Here's my question for you all:** Because I'm obviously dependent on this now, and the off nights are beginning to show, **would it make more sense for me to take it every night instead of every other night while tapering?** I know that normally wouldn't be the answer, but my situation is somewhat different, I guess. The cycle of 1 night with restful sleep, and the next filled with what I described above is driving me insane. I'm afraid this pattern will make it more difficult for me to taper.

I would sincerely appreciate some insight on this, as I'm not quite sure which route to take.

Thanks in advance",2

Like most of us, phenibut use for me started casually after reading about all the benefits. Unfortunately I never saw, or chose to ignore the long term negative effects, addiction and withrawl. Something I regret deeply. 

At first I was doing 1gpd every few days but within a month I was using daily. I had a full time job at the time and limited my use to the evenings, and really enjoyed how it carried over into the next day. I maintained that dosage for several months before ramping it up. I have a vague recollection of exactly when things got heavy but it has been at least 6-8 months that I have been averaging 4-6gpd. 

At this point I did realize it was a problem but probably chose to tell myself I’m invincible and I can kick this any time. I had honestly never read about the withdrawal process. Stupid me. 
Anyways, as my dosages increased the benefits came and went, some days very little gave me huge effect and other days big doses seemingly did nothing. One thing that remained constant was headaches. And with that came lots of ibprufen and Tylenol. 

Fast forward to this past Wednesday. Wednesday I was going to try and go without phenibut. Mon-we’d was spent doing a project in n my car combined with an intense yard project and new at home workouts with my girlfriend doing moves I have never done before. Now, I have had lower back problems for some time because I was a stunt driver for many years and literally jumped cars daily for a living. However, Wednesday a felt some lower back pain that was a little more uncomfortable than usual. Thursday it was worse and I started freaking out about it. I did some research and cane to the conclusion that something was wrong with my kidney. I started drinking TONS of water and of course was up all night urinating, crippling anxiety, “kidney” discomfort etc. it was horrible. After more research I wasn’t surprised I had done this to myself with all the phenibut, ibuprofen, and occasional cycling of other supplement like phenylpiracetam, sulbutiamine, huperzine-a, adrafinil etc. I went to an urgent care on Friday for a urinalysis. No blood in my urine but the doctor agreed it sounded like a bad UTI or kidney stones and prescribed me with a anti-biotic, and an anti-inflammatory. I drank as much water as I could that day and Friday night was even worse. No sleep at all. Horrible. Every time I closed my eyes I heard things and possibly saw things, strange things even though I was fully awake. I was having crazy chills, shakes or tremors. I made it through the night and decided to try some asheaganda in the morning to calm me down. It worked for a little bit and then the crippling anxiety came back to me while watching my girlfriend do the yard project I could no longer help her with. She knew what was going on and we did some more research on quitting phenibut. Turns out cold turkey was probably a bad idea. So I took 1.8g. In 1 hr I was feeling much better and that phenibut rush felt like day 1. However, the best thing it did was allow me to separate symptoms of my perceived kidney issue and what I was actually just manifesting in my head. So now I was in a clear enough headspace to consult with some physicians online and after some exhaustive conversations came to the conclusion that it’s just a muscular/skeletal issue associated with different workout I had been doing etc. 

So, here is where I am at right now. We have decided that a taper down approach is best. I slept good last night. Woke up and took some ashwaganda to get me by for a little while and at 1:15pm I took .85g of phenibut. And I am planning the same dose later this evening. 

I don’t know what the best and safest course of action is from here. I would like to visit a doctor and see about a plan but I’m not sure if I will be able to find a doctor that knows anything about phenibut. Naturally, I want to be off of this stuff for good in the shortest amount of time without having long term effects or getting hooked into something else.
To be honest those few days cold turkey were very traumatic. VERY

Is the best advice to continue a slow taper or does anyone have advice on how to find a doctor in my area that has experience with phenibut withdrawals? 

I see other supplements thrown around in this sub that may help or others seem to be prescription. Please Help!! And thank you! 

This is really ignorant of me, but I should also note that I never realized I was taking such high doses. When I got my first batch of phenibut the package said that 1/4tsp was equal to .48g. At least that how I remembered it. And that is how I always measured it out. So turns out I was taking nearly double.",7

All these symptoms I’m seeing of withdrawing or from taking it so long I thought it was just me but it was actually the drug/withdraws talking. I use to only take a couple capsules maybe once or twice a week but then in around October of 2018 I got to where I took it just about everyday. I would take it one day and then the next day I would take a dose of kratom but all day my head would be killing me until the next day when I took another dose of phenibut. I got to where I was feeling detached from reality, like I was looking at my life through a screen instead of through my own eyes if that makes sense. I thought it was me or just an anxiety phase so I continued to consume phenibut. My last straw was when I go to where I would have to leave work because my heart would be racing so bad I’d have to leave work. I remember the day I stopped I was sitting at home watching a show , I had just took 4 capsules. And all of a sudden I felt like I was having a heart attack. It took me a couple hours to calm down but I made it. From then on I swore I would never do it again. It never occurred to me that I could get withdraws from this “supplement”. So for 6 months I wasn’t myself. I have drastically increased anxiety, increased depression. Constant weekly visits to the ER. It was a nightmare. The only thing that helped eased it was kratom. And I was back to myself about November of last year. But I would never in a million years want to take it again even though it made me feel on top of the world! JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY STORY GUYS!

I used to frequent this board when I was coming off of phenibut. A lot of the people here saved me and made my withdrawal much more bearable, so it's long over due that I come back and try to help people who are struggling. 

&#x200B;

A quick background: I did 5-10g's of phenibut daily for a little over 10 months. Usually I did 7-8g's, but sometimes more and sometimes less. I ingested the 250mg pills, handfuls at a time. Around the 10 month mark, the drug completely turned on me. One night I had severe anxiety and I kept taking more and more to quell it but all it did was make it worse. This is when I knew I had to stop. 

I tapered with gabapentin. It was not easy... but I did overcome. After about 4 months I was 90% back to normal.

The most scary withdrawal sympton I encountered was depersonalization. I didn't believe existence was real and that coupled with the concept of time would send me into full blown panic attacks. That was by FAR the worst aspect. Second to that, insomnia followed by anedonia.

&#x200B;

If there is any questions you have or anything I can do to possibly help I am here to help and answer to the best of my ability. Just know that you will get back to normal.. this does pass. I am 100% normal today and my anxiety is significantly less than it was when I initially started phenibut due to practices I implemented during withdrawal.",8

The first phenibut withdrawls (2-6gpd) were pretty terrible but i think I’ve got a fairly ok psychy to have dealt with it + still being on pregabalin probably helped enormously! I had some visual and audial hallucinations but i kept telling myself that it was all chemical and my brain re balancing and kinda made it thru.
Now not so smart me but with good intentions decides to quit the pregabalin, i wanted to do it cold turkey but was quite afraid of possible seizure potential (although ive never experienced any and its unheard of happening in my family but still) and decided to ditch it and use phenibut “just for a week” for the withdrawls (very stupid i know, idk what i was evening thinking) so that week turned into what now is nearly three months. If i had to make an estimate I’d have to say its been about a 2-4gpd habit- ive decided to quit as i dont trust myself and my addictive personality to self medicate anymore and ive tapered down haphazardly in the past week .Yet now i feel the wds kicking in HARD- the insomnia , tachycardia, tingles everywhere and tensing muscles- the usual good stuff..
So what recommendations do you guys have for me making this wd a little less painful? How long have they usually lasted for you guys? Are there any supplements you could recommend? How could i approach a doctor with this? Because where i live im not sure how doctors would even respond haha

I should have my Phenibut package tomorrow. 

Something weird I’ve noticed, Tianeptine does fuck all for my Phenibut WDs. I can take 3x my normal dose and still not feel a thing. It’s so weird. 
Also: even when feeling “ok” but being below my normally daily Phenibut amount affects how the Tia works for me. 🤔

I went to my psychiatrist. She was no help at all, because she never heard of phenibut. She refused to prescribe me anything other than 10mg baclofen a day. She suggested I go to a detox. Luckily, there is a detox near me that has heard of phenibut, and are willing to help.

I cannot taper. I have no money, recently became unemployed due to COVID-19, and am sure as hell not gonna CT 25gpd.

I last used my 25g on April 5th, at 11pm. Did not use any last night. I can go into this detox whenever I please, but I want to make sure I am in WD so I don't start early and get left hanging at the end of my 5 day stay.

The thing is, all that's happened so far is that I did not sleep last night, and my hands are a bit shaky. No real anxiety (never been an anxious person) or thoughts of doom. Still eating fine, etc. But dry mouth

When am I gonna go into WD? I want to make sure I go so I can see the doctor during his hours, 9-5, and if I get WD tonight, I'd have to sweat it out until the doctor arrived. I'd rather stay home and suffer with my own movies until that time comes.",3

Oh how I wish someone would have spoken these words to me.    


Stay safe kids and maybe let this weird ass place in time work for you? the whole world is nuts right now.....perfect time to get OFF this shit (or any other shit you're struggling with).  Blame it on corona.  Get yourself free.

""I know it will probably be bit rough just stopping, but is there anything dangerous about it?""

See......this is a huge problem I've noticed on this reddit page the last few months I've been hanging around. This statement could very easily morph into a 'self-fulfilling prophecy'.

Why do we all want to expect the worst? we are all dealing with a substance which we know creates a little anxiety upon cessation. The anxiety created, in and of itself, is unsettling. But the anxiety doesn't need to run away with our precious mind state. At 3 weeks it WILL be mild !

This shit is temporary. Humans are all very, very different from one another. Just because person A had a horrible time does not mean person B will. Not at all. Person A may be 65 years old while person B is 20 years old. Person A may be schizophrenic while person B is simply a person who enjoys getting high.

Generalizations like this can simply fuck us to bits. We won't even want to try. We expect to be debilitated beyond measure and end up using phenibut every day for months (because we are so fucking terrified of the possibilities).

I have said this here a few times and I will once again.......fear is an enemy of quitting. Because an exorbitant number of us began using phenibut to eradicate innate anxiety.....we are by and large subject to fear. Fear of anxiety.

We can't escape the fact that there WILL be some anxiety in quitting.....so what?

Why expect it to be too much for us to handle? I'm pissed at myself for becoming victim to that mentality. It kept me using this substance for 10 months DAILY. The fear of withdrawals kept me using it every day for months passed what I wanted to.

Now that I've been tapering many months I realize how I allowed fear to control me. Have there been a few brief uncomfortable moments? sure. But I was perfectly equipped to deal with them. I just didn't know it.

Phenibut (for me) was a crutch. And daily use created WAY more anxiety than this taper has given me by at least 10 fold.

I could go on and on.....but I won't. I do want you to know though that your use is MINIMAL. Had I realized that back when I did that 3 week 'roll' with it......I'd never have needed to taper off. Instead I allowed fear to rule and kept taking it for many months. I hovered at a gram a day for 3 months feeling shitty (for NO good reason).

Just cut your use NOW. Don't let it continue into eternity. Accept a little discomfort. Take one for the team ( the team being your future brain cells,lol). Honestly.....you could probably just stop now, have 3 or 4 days of mild anxiety and be done.

You are the envy of the whole sub. Just drop it now. Do a super fast taper if your psyche is giving you problems. Like a gram a day even......just STOP.

Oh....and of course, good luck. :)

TLDR:

JUST STOP.....fast taper, fine.....immediate stop, equally fine. 3 weeks is in the ""get outta jail free' zone. Those of us who are long term tapering simply allowed our ""get out of jail free"" card to go unnoticed. I'll never do that agin though ! BOOM.

EDIT:

This lengthy reply was less for you OP, and more for the many future readers of this sub....those (like me) who ruminate wayyyyy too much. Folks (like me) who fear the unknown. And end up fucking ourselves because we just weren't ""brave enough to try"".

Lastly to those people like me......JUST DO IT. It absolutely will be OK. Let's just all support one another and get the hell out of these stupid expensive habits that don't solve any problems (just create more).",8

2020-04-05 16:38:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fvkw3v/the_wrath_of_phenibut_withdrawal/,The wrath of phenibut withdrawal,"In my experience it is the worst feeling ever. If you had problems in your life anyway, and were using Phenibut to mask them, then they will come back twenty times as bad. Withdrawal strips away any optimistic delusions the Phenibut might have given you, and puts you into a state of intense ‘depressive realism'. You see things seemingly for how they are, and find it physically impossible to believe in potential hope of a miracle happening. You are forced to confront the crushing hopelessness of your situation. Any optimism you remember from your Phenibut days seems like meaningless self-delusion. Regrets and doubts multiply. You start planning for the worst, expecting the worst.

Waking up at 3am every morning after ultra-depressing dreams, your energy reserves are depleted. Your range of vision widens so you can see out of the corners of your eyes, like a prey animal. It feels like there are cold, damp, grey clouds above your eyes. Vision becomes blurry and you feel old. Smiling becomes physically impossible and fake. Breathing is difficult, you can hold your breath for a long time before having to force yourself to take a big, stressful gulp of air. You may get audible hallucinations, such as hearing a chorus of a particular song repeated over and over again, almost mockingly loudly, when you lie in bed. Things like tooth pain that were masked with GABA are felt again. If you were worried about balding, your scalp will feel cold. Your worst fears will be played upon, as if by a demon, and exaggerated. You find it easy to believe in Hell, but impossible to believe in Heaven.

It gets worse for the first three days, then stays bad, becomes manageable by the end of the first week of cold turkey, though you stay melancholy for about two more weeks. This is based on having taken a relatively high dose daily for several months. With more sensible dosage, the withdrawal will be far milder.",19

I had to force myself to pee for a solid 10 minutes because i genuinely did not feel the need to throw up which is unusual especially for phenibut because usually when im this messed up.. I also had to hit my vape to lower my bpm because it constricts my blood vessels and supposedly will gives your heart an easier time pumping blood which did lower my bpm to about 120. my vape has potentially saved my life ironically. I also slammmed a couple of glasses of water to flush my system which also probably saved my life.

But what is the best way i can tapper? I would prefer not  to get anymore because i know the route that would lead me and i do realize that my fear of withdrawal as well as my mental health issues have made me  less caring about what goes into my body long term. This may have been a subconcious suicide attempt but it may have took me to almost dying to realize i do not indeed want to die. I am trying not to lay down because when i do my bpm skyrockets. And now that i get to the end of my post my bpm has lowered to normal levels and i am less scared which is awesome but my stumach is making the weirdest noises i have ever heard. To those who are using phenibut please use responsibly and never take megadoses and if you find yourself using daily please stop. I will make a new post documenting my withdrawal experiences. I am not saying this is bad or needs to be made illegal or anything like that because most people who use, use responsibly and use no more than 2 or 3 times a week and certainly not in the dangerous doses i have found myself using. I have had similar experiences with zinc oversode, 5htp, and alcohol but this is the first time i genuinely felt as if i was going to die because of my bpm and inability to vomit, pee or flush my system in any way.

I also should note i did not take any other substances along with it just phenibut. No caffeine or anything.",5

That'd be enough to last me about 4 days, which would be fine normally, since I can order 2 day from liftmode and usually get it the next day (I live like 2 hours away from their HQ, so normally the 2 day shipping comes overnight). But is Liftmode even shipping right now, with Illinois on lockdown? If not, which vendors are shipping with 2 day? I really feel like this is all just going to implode on me soon with all the coronavirus stuff going on and I'm gonna end up having to go cold turkey. I know this isn't strictly quitting related, so sorry I have to ask about it here. A lot of my posts here aren't strictly quitting related in general, and I feel terrible about it, I just don't know where else to turn, there are so few communities of people going through this that I can't think of anywhere else to ask some of these questions.

Anyway, back to the subject at hand, which vendors are shipping right now? Is Liftmode specifically shipping? Any help is appreciated.",2

I've stayed in touch with a few members of this community that have helped me immensely so far and I cannot thank you guys enough for that. So here's some backstory and where I'm at:

I always dose once a day as soon as I wake up. That's how it's always been and I intend to keep that routine going. I began dosing every day in late July and slowly increasing my dose up until the middle of February. Once I was at 12+ grams I started experiencing extreme side effects that I'd never felt before (dizziness, constant sleepiness, no motivation, no attention span, anxiety, depression), alllll that good stuff. I think the maximum dose I ever took was 12.4g but I'm not entirely sure. On 2/16 I decided I was going to stabilize at 12gpd then start my taper. Agmatine came in the mail 2 days later, took a week of lowering my phen dose & adding Agmatine to feel pretty normal, and I've been lowering ever since. I feel like I DEFINITELY could've tapered a lot faster and cut my doses by much more in the beginning but it is what it is. 

I’m also at a weird point in my taper where some days I feel good and a tiny bit high, some days just completely normal, some days extremely energized, some days tired, some days super emotional etc etc.. The biggest issue that I’ve faced lately is a lack of motivation and severe lack of interest in doing things like listening to music which I absolutely adore, I have a gigantic record collection (my favorite hobby is collecting). Most nights I get into a mood where I feel really down and depressed, not necessarily anxious, but just numb I guess, and it sucks.

I've been sitting on 90x10mg Baclofen tablets for almost a month now. I was just waiting until my daily dose got low enough to incorporate it successfully and painfully. **Yesterday I dosed** **8.1g along with 1.5g Agmatine**. **This morning, 4/4, I took 6g Phenibut, 1g Agmatine, and 10mg Baclofen** when I woke up. My plan is to use 20mg of Baclofen to replace 2g of Phenibut, so I had the intention of taking 2 5mg Baclofen throughout the day today. It's now been about 11 hours since then and I'm honestly so surprised at how I feel: fine, baseline, normal!! About 3 hours ago I took 5mg Baclofen so I still have another 5mg for tonight. 

I'm just not entirely sure how to go about the rest of my taper with the Baclofen included. Would it be advisable to stay on the same dose (of phen & bac) I took today for another day or two, then slowly taper the Baclofen until I'm only taking 6g phen by itself? Or would it be better to do it the other way around and replace 500mg phenibut for 5mg Baclofen every few days? Are there any different effects I might experience replacing a few grams of phenibut for a few mg of Baclofen (more motivation, energy, little better mood, etc.)?? I've read a ton of posts on this subreddit regarding this topic but I'd love some insight from you guys about my personal situation.

Eventually I want to be off the phenibut completely and switch over to just Baclofen, but I'd like to wait until my daily phenibut dose is lower so I'm not taking a ton of Bac every day. Does that make sense and seem like the best course of action? I just ordered a large amount of Baclofen so I'll be stocked up.

Below are screenshots of my taper schedule. It's helped me immensely in keeping track of my doses, finding taper patterns that work for me, and just giving me reassurance that I'm succeeding thus far. Any advice, comments, or questions would be amazing!! Peace

I'm sure it'd vary from person to person but say twice the recommended dose for cough?

Not sure which is the more potent NMDA antagonist, but considering how messed up some people get on large doses, I'd think it's DXM. It's also not a vasodilator like agmatine for those with health problems or already using vasodilators. 

I know personally, agmatine helped give me some ugly eyebags and maybe side effects at 1g 3x/day. I switched to 500mg 3x bc I only have a few left and actually feel better. Hard to describe.

I'm going to try it if it's not too god awful expensive for some generic cough gels but I was wondering if anyone else has so I don't necessarily waste my money. Let me know, thanks!",3
2020-04-04 14:44:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fuyy72/excercise_intolerance_wtf_is_up/,Excercise Intolerance... WTF is up?,"I am 45 days off of phenibut (plus 90 days free from phenylpiracetam, centrophenoxine, adrafinil, mucuna pruriens & occasional other noots) after a 2.5-3 years of daily usage 2-3x/day. I used Baclofen to taper and still take 2.5mg 4x/day... my goal is to be 100% clean by April 18th and I am slowly tapering Baclofen too. I started with 5mg 5-6x/day. 

So, I had a Nerve Conduction Study and EMG 40 days ago ago on my right hand, arm, shoulder, pectoral, leg, foot, hip and glute... everything came back clean. No Neuromuscular Disease. Although, my neurologist said if I continue to experience CNS symptoms, he wants to do an MRI. 

My anxiety and depression are bad but I expected that... my hand tremors have gone from all day, every day to only experience them a few times each day now. 

My main problem(s) is muscle related. Muscle loss, occasional muscle weakness and excercise intolerance. 

Like I get worn out VERY QUICKLY and my strength will go from 100% to 50% and I also start breathing heavy and just feel like I am drained. After I rest for 10 minutes or so, I feel fine. 

Does anyone else experience this? It definitely gets worse whenever I cut my Baclofen dose so I assume that everything is related but I am already pretty lean and I don't have much muscle to lose PLUS doing anything athletic wears me out. 

Every time I kick the soccer ball around with my kids, or start to run or workout, I get this same feeling. So, I start to google symptoms and freak out about my health situation. Over and over... I repeat the cycle every 5-10 days. 

Is anyone else dealing with this? Should I schedule another appointment with my neurologist?

I'm not like, tripping and falling or having trouble with normal activities... it's just when I exert ANY additional energy, I feel drained. 

I just want my life back! I played in a Mens Soccer League and coached my daughter's team last season! I was always in the garage working on a project or do something around the house. But now, every time I do anything above and beyond... I struggle.",2

2020-04-03 19:55:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/fujekz/i_just_cant_take_this_anymore/,I just can't take this anymore,"I'm kinda just venting here I guess, I don't think there's much of a productive use for this post, but it's just that I don't have anywhere else I can go with this.

I've talked extensively on this sub about all of the glutamate side effects I've been experiencing as a result of high dose phenibut. They're getting to the point where I can't bear them anymore. It's not even like they're the worst thing in the world, it's just how CONSTANT they are. Even though I've gotten them down to a pretty manageable level by splitting my doses up, taking agmatine and sticking to a low-glutamate diet, they're still there from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. It's been like 2 months since the last time I just felt normal and it's killing me. There are so many things I used to enjoy that I just can't anymore because of this shit. 

I think the thing that bothers me the most is laying down. Before the glutamate surges started, I used to just lay down, close my eyes and let my imagine run wild. I'd do it every single day, sometimes even for hours at a time. It was one of my favorite things to do, and now I can't enjoy it at all. Every time I try, all I can focus on is this vibrating feeling and how bad I feel.

It makes tapering crazy difficult too, because when I taper, I have to deal with the glutamate side effects on TOP OF the withdrawal, and it's just brutal. I wish I had done it when I was still unemployed, I might've actually been able to do that. But of course, the glutamate stuff didn't start getting constant enough for me to feel the need to taper until after I started working again.

One of the things that makes me the most upset about all of this is the fact that I'd be close to done with my taper by now if it weren't for someone on here convincing me that the ""shaking"" feeling that comes from glutamate surges was actually a withdrawal. At the time, I still didn't know what was going on, just that I felt horrible, so I asked around on here, and someone was pretty confident that it was coming from withdrawals. Of course, I was willing to do anything to get rid of this feeling (as I still am), so I ramped up my dose a bit. I didn't feel any better the first time, but I thought I might've needed 5 or 6 days to ""stabilize"" like I did last time I went through withdrawals, so I kept the dose up. Didn't work, and I've been stuck at this dose since. (Edit: I meant to clarify this here originally but was kinda in a stream of conscious moment, but I don't blame the person who gave me that advice at all, obviously they were trying to help. It was my dumbass fault to raise the dose and keep it there in the first place anyway. I'm just pissed at the situation I'm in)

I just want to get off this stuff and feel normal again NOW, and it feels like there's no end in sight. Especially since I'm working now. I'd just take a month or two off and fast taper like crazy but I literally just started. That and the fact that we're crazy busy with all the coronavirus hysteria would make taking a long time off crazy. I really just want to be off in a month or less tops and that's just not an option while also having to be a functioning member of society. Is tapering off from 10 gpd even possible while also keeping a job?

I just don't know at this point. I really just want out by any means possible. I've thought so many times about just ending it, because it sounds better than this. I realize that probably sounds like a huge overreaction, but obviously, I'm not too mentally stable to start with, and I have absolutely nothing going for me in life and nothing to look forward to anyway.

Anyway, sorry for the journal entry there, I just really needed to get that off my chest and don't have anywhere else to vent this. I guess, to anyone who's considering taking phenibut, or maybe someone who's at a lower dose but wants to raise it to get the magic back, maybe someone who's on the verge of a relapse: don't end up like me. Your life is so much better without this. Exercise, smoke some weed, maybe have a couple drinks, just do ANYTHING but end up like me.",4
