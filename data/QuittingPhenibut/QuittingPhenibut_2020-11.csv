My story of starting and successfully stopping Phenibut.,"Before I started phenibut, I was taking 600mg of Gabapentin once a day at night for sleep sweats. It didn't do much and they put me on klonopin. After 2 years, I'd had enough and wanted to stop. My ignorant ass just let the script run out and didn't refill. I woke up one day with the horrible anxiety we all know and hate.

&#x200B;

I remembered that I had left over gabapentin and took a 600mg tablet. It was my 1st time taking it during the day and WOW did it work....it worked SO well, better than any antidepressant I've ever tried. I mentioned that to my doctor and they started me on 600mg of Gabapentin 3x a day. It worked pretty great except for when I'd type out emails and such where it was like I developed dyslexia.

Anyhow a couple of years in, after each dose would start to wear off, I'd become extremely depressed, suicidal etc. I then stopped gabapentin after reading about gabapentin suicides. It was around that time I found phenibut. Not knowing it was essentially the same thing. It too worked for a while, then ended up doing the same thing.  Shortly before I stopped phenibut, I would notice after 4 or 5 days taking phenibut I would have a solid 24-48hrs of complete darkness/apathy/suicidal ideations/etc etc....even if I took phenibut. The ONLY way to get out of it would be to double my dose which I only did once. Once I figured out it would pass, if I would wake up in that funk....take phenibut and still be in that funk...I would simply ride it out because I did not want to get in the raising doseage trap after my experiences with kratom. After a day, sometimes two, I'd wake up and feel completely back to normal.  At that time, I was taking 2 to 3 doses of 1g when this was happening.

The majority of my time on phenibut, I was taking 600mg 2-3x a day and it worked fantastic, never had to increase the amounts. It wasn't until my scale broke and I got lazy trying to eyeball it that I got into the 1g+ dosing.

&#x200B;

TLDR: After taking phenibut for a while, it essentially made me bi-polar....from what I call rapid cycling (super down between doses) to complete days in that funk.

&#x200B;

I'm simply curious how it turned on other people. I've seen stories of people taking it, and it making them feel worse while on it. I never experienced that in the 4 years I was taking it. I know we're all different which is why I like to get others' POV.

&#x200B;

I was able to quit using the baclofen method. I simply made an appointment with a neurologist, explained the sound sensitivity I was having, showed him the phenibut/baclofen cases and he had no issues at all with prescribing it to me. Even gave me 20 refills. In my experience, the baclofen instantly made me feel 'stable'... I'm not sure how else to word it. It however did NOTHING for the insomnia so I asked for Trazadone as well.  It also didn't do 'that' much for anxiety. I remembered I had a script for propranolol and that was the magic bullet. Shortly after, anedohnia set in and I started 150mg ER Wellbutrin. I haven't looked back since, and now only take propranolol which is for my essential tremor.

&#x200B;

My helper meds:

1. Baclofen 10mg tabs
2. Propranolol
3. Trazadone
4. Wellbutrin

IF YOU'RE ON THIS SUB, LOOKING TO QUIT but are SCARED, please feel free to DM me anytime. YOU CAN, YOU WILL DO THIS.

If phenibut has turned on you...I assure you that 'feeling stable' is such an amazing thing that happens almost instantly (at least for me) after tapering down and using baclofen. Baclofen feels MUCH 'cleaner'?

&#x200B;

NOTE: I've suffered from depression for the past 16 years after facing 3 tragedies back to back. I tend to go on and off of Wellbutrin or Pristiq. My brain is weird...the medicines get me out of a funk almost immediately and after a few months, they do the opposite. When I stop I'm good to go for a while. Almost like they do a 'reset'",7

Checking in again on my journey being clean of phenibut. It’s been about 9 months I believe so almost a year out. Health wise, I’m doing alright currently on low dose gabapentin and on a cycle of accutane (my skin got the worst its ever been since quitting). I have to take liver enzyme tests and my liver is quite healthy. But besides that, drinking only water and the very occasional beer/weed (I swear). 

I’ve realized that most of us are either addicts or people that needed help and never got it. I’ve also realized that we’re the kinds of people that like to take matters into our own hands. But sometimes you need to ask for help however, convincing a stubborn person to get help is nearly impossible. I recently watched “Don’t worry, he won’t get far on foot”, its about addicts and its comedic. But I think it showed there’s a positive side to addiction and I think it’s that there’s a lack of meaning among addicts that needs to be fulfilled. 

After quitting phen, I’ve made close friends, got a sick programming job at a high profile game company, moved into a nice place, and now I’m planning on doing an open mic (cross it off the bucket list). I’m a single 20m and have had my fair share of women post phen as well if anyone is worried about that before quitting. I am also diagnosed with anxiety/depression. 

Anyways for those of you new here, welcome. I highly highly recommend quitting phenibut. It teaches you hard work which you can apply to all parts of your life. Trust the process, trust yourself, and if you don’t want to get help then take it into your own hands and set some goals for yourself post phen. 

Good luck folks and as always my DMs are always open.",11

 I've read about this substance and its basically GABA with vitamin B-3 attached to it, thus allowing it to cross into the brain, increasing GABA levels and balancing out glutamate levels. It doesn't act as a agonist but it just helps to imcrease depleted levels of GABA by turning glutamate into GABA. 

So when your tapering off of Phenibut and your glutamate levels are firing like crazy my theory suggests that taking Picamilon would help to turn your crazy firing glutamate levels  back into depleted GABA thus allowing your brain to balance back out quicker? 

Its just a theory but I'm really wondering if Picamilon would help this way or if anyone on here actually tried to do this? Any answers or theories are welcome 🙏 🙂",6

It’s starting to get pretty rough. I have 200 10mg Baclofen. So you think I could continue this taper or go a little slower. If I can continue, should I add a bit more Baclofen.

Note that I do not take my Phenibut and Baclofen together because I take my Baclofen when I start to feel icky from without having Phenibut. Should I take them together? Because for me it seems pretty good spread out.

Like many people here, I stupidly starting phenibut without properly researching it. I thought it was nootropic and definitely did not expect to get hooked on it like I did. Lesson learned. 

I started taking phenibut in early July of this year. It started out as 1g every few days but by August I was taking 3 gpd, and by September I was taking 4gpd. I started getting nauseated every time I took it and on September 21st I decided to quit. The first day wasn’t bad at all, but I had nightmares that night and the next day I knew something wasn’t right. Heavy, fast heartbeat, sweaty palms and feet, hot and cold flashes, and I felt very flat mentally and emotionally. I tried to stick it out, thinking that if I just got through it, it would all be over by the next week. As the day dragged on, my physical symptoms got worse and I read everything I could find about phenibut withdrawal. I was really scared. Luckily, I found this sub and was dissuaded from continuing cold turkey. 

I stabilized myself at 4gpd, which took about 4 days of 4gpd to get back to feeling almost normal, then I started my taper. I had the 250mg capsules, so I started off by dropping 250mg every other day, taking it all at noon every day. I didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms until I got to 2.75 gpd. Then it was almost as bad as the initial withdrawal I got in the first place, except instead of feeling emotionally flat, I was weepy and anxious because I felt like I had so far to go, it was going to be horrible the whole rest of the way, and maybe I wouldn’t even make it off this stuff anyway. I felt hopeless. I really didn’t want to add in any more substances, but after reading about agmatine, I decided to order some and give it a try. I stayed at 2.75 gpd until it arrived. When it arrived, I had already taken my phenibut for the day about a half hour before. I was feeling hopeless and physically uncomfortable and teary, and within 20 minutes of taking 1g agmatine I was feeling much better. 

I resumed my taper 2 days later, taking 1g agmatine 20 minutes before taking phenibut. I also changed to dropping 250mg every third day. I did this until I got to 500mg. Spent 5 days at 500mg, 7 days at 250mg, then jumped off. I did buy some powder in case I need to taper down further, but I didn’t end up needing it. After I started using agmatine I didn’t really have any noticeable withdrawal symtoms. 

All in all, it wasn’t so bad. I’ve been off for a week now and I feel great. I feel like myself again. I definitely recommend agamatine. I ran 3 miles every other day during the taper and I think this helped a lot with my mindset. I also smoked marijuana at nighttime and took a 50mg diphenhydramine sleep aid nightly and I was able to sleep just fine the whole time, though I wouldn’t recommend marijuana if you’re having a lot of anxiety. My only firm rule for myself during the taper was to never take more than I did the day before. If I needed to take an extra day before dropping, I did. 

Thank you to everyone on this sub who has shared their experiences! It was a helpful resource to me, and even though I just lurked on here during my taper, it was very helpful in reminding me I wasn’t the only one going through it and that other people had made it to the other side and I could too. For anyone still  going through it, hang in there! You’ve got this!",25

I first tried using baclofen when I was up to 6 gpd on phenibut and tried to slowly switch over to baclofen. I started out taking 5 g of phenibut and 10 mg of baclofen, but I noticed my anxiety would spike soon after taking baclofen. At first I thought it was just normal phenibut withdrawals, but then I tried just taking 5 gpd with no baclofen and the anxiety went away. 

Yesterday, I finally got down to 400 mg per day. My anxiety was manageable the past few days, but sleep was a huge issue. Last night was my second night in a row where I was tossing and turning and couldn’t fall into REM sleep. Last night I got desperate and took 10 mg of baclofen in hopes that I was just imagining that it made my anxiety worse, but then my anxiety spiked roughly half an hour later. Not only could I not fall asleep, but my anxiety made me borderline delusional. In a panic, I took 2 g of phenibut. I’m sure it was overkill, but I was desperate. 

Does this happen to anyone else? Am I having some sort of weird allergic reaction to baclofen? Could it be because it’s not mixing well with the meds I currently take (60 mg Vyvanse and 20 mg Prozac)? Maybe it’s because people won’t process the same medications the same same way. I don’t know. I just need people to tell me that I’m not the only one this happens to

Tomorrow I’m seeing my doctor. I’ll try to ask him to prescribe me something just for sleep since my anxiety is fine during the day. He already knows about my phenibut problem and was the one who prescribed me the baclofen. I trust him to make the best judgement on my situation.",1

That's HUGE for me and makes me feel there might be hope getting off this shitty train.

I've been using it whenever I felt like it and the last month I just have no clue.  4 scoops, sometimes 6 all over the map.  So I decided to start this taper assuming I use about 2-3 grams a day.  For my first week I wanted to be aggressive.  And I also wanted to whittle down all the sporadic dosing down to twice a day.  


Plan:   


Current dose for week one is 900mg twice a day.  On my3rd day and so far feel OK.  Had some visual hallucinations yesterday I never had those before. That shit was weird but it passed.  


As I get to lower dosing I'll slow it down more. 200mg drops once a week (until 1 gram) 100 mg drops once a week (until 500mg) then 50 mg drops once a week (until 250mg) then 25 mg drops once a week.  Then alternate one day on one off for awhile.  Then jump.  


So fucking easy to lay all this out, right? now to stay glued to the mission.  I promise not to post every drop I don't want to bore you nice people.  But damn it helps to not feel alone.  Good luck bros.",9

Then up to three for months it ruined me almost permanently. I managed over time to get down to enough to not get sick which is 1 g or under . But my body is being ripped apart by it. Side effects are bad Withdrawals are satan incarnate, I want off this stuff I do have good stories I gained a lot from it also , it’s great for people who have will power and no addiction...

I should mention I have also been using Kratom daily at about 20gpd. The last 2 weeks have been hell. Countless nights with little or no sleep and running on heavy rebound anxiety throughout the day. 

My job consists of heavy responsibility. I am the Forman for a 8 man construction crew, and a snowboard coach as well. I have read about different ways to detox from this nasty stuff and haven’t really found a solid conclusion. It almost seems like tapering is my only option. 

I have a wife and 2 dogs who also rely on my to perform well. I love them to death. The other day after feeling psychotic I had to break the news to her about my addiction. She suggested that I dump it all down the toilet. After explaining to her this is not a viable option, she did some research and found a tapering schedule for both phenibut and kratom. I will be reducing my dose by 10% gradually over 2 weeks from 18gpd and 20gpd. I couldn’t be more grateful to have such an amazing partner to support me through this process. I really hope I can get back to my normal self.

I  have been using phenibut for almost 1-2 years now to curb my anxiety. I  am a 22 year old male and i started drugs at around 17, untill about a  year ago i was still using amphetamine daily (and have done so for about  8 months) in combination with phenibut. I also abused some other stuff  but wont get too informative on that.

I  am happy to have achieved sobriety for all substances i was using in  the past, seriously. The only factor which i am still stuck with is  phenibut.

I have always had higher anxiety, this started in my late teens.

\------ My situation at the moment ------Currently  i am using about 2.5 scoops (1cc) of phenibut a day. I take 1 scoop  around breakfast, 1 scoop around dinner, and 1 scoop about an hour or so  before bed. All dissolved in water.

Lately,  i have been experiencing allot of panic attacks and high anxiety almost  daily. i moved back to my parents a couple days ago since i feel safer  there.

I have finally decided i  want to kick my last addiction for real. I have been to the GP past week  and have talked about my problems. I have an appointment 15th of dec  with a nurse practicioner to hopefully get some help.

I  am honestly lost at the moment and i would really appreciate your guys'  input on my situation and what i could do now already since i struggle  daily with my anxiety, even with my phenibut dose. Also might be nice to  say that i have not really increased my dose for almost half a year  now, i have been stuck with the 2.5 scoops (1cc per scoop) a day for a  long time now.

I have been abusing phenibut on and off since i was 17 and am 22 now.

Thank you so much for reading and i hope i can get some help here.  


Edit: forgot to mention that i wake up allot of times every night with high anxiety and close to panic attack due to high heartrate which worsens my anxiety.",3

First post on this board. I recently quit Kratom cold turkey and started taking phenibut to help with WD's. And well.... It worked a little too well. I had taken it a few months back but heard of the addictive properties and thought 1 drug was enough to be dependent on. Anyway. Ive been taking between 1.2g and 1.8g for the past week daily, missing one day. So can I expect any WD's stopping now (just after a week).  If so Ill start a taper over the next few days. If not I'll stop now.

I've been using phenibut every day for two years and meaning to quit for about most of that time.  Every day I wake up and say ""not today, I will need energy to (fill in the blank)"".  


Well.....fuck that.  I can't keep doing this to myself.  My family needs me to be emotionally stable and I'm just not.  I lose my temper all the time these days and I'm no fun to be around.  My energy level is all over the map and I only enjoy anything if I'm high.  Between doses I'm just empty. I don't want to be like this anymore.  


That's my story.  My plan is to start a taper but I keep seeing so many methods here.  Some people drop and hover there a few days where other people drop off 10mg every dose.  Does it really matter?  


No matter what this is going to be hard for me.  My self-discipline has just dissolved into nothingness the past 2 years and I know a lot has to do with how shitty I feel about myself for all this.  I can't keep on 'kicking the can down the road' if I don't grab the bull by the horns and DO THIS then I'll just be an empty shell of a human being.  I don't want that for myself.

I've tried to limit it to every 3-4 days but have had some slip ups with doing it on consecutive days. I have gone up to 3.5 gs or so. My last dose before the 1g dose I took tonight was 1.6gs four days ago. I have trouble sleeping night 2 and night 3 (if I wait 4 days). 

My current stack
Adderall: 20mg (try to only do 2-3 days in a row max)

Agmatine sulfate: 1g 1-2x per day

NAC: 600mg varying between 1-3 x per day

Lions Mane: 1.5g per day

Uridine Monophospahte: 250-500mg on days i dont take adderall 2× per day and just once at night on days I do 

Kratom: 1.75gs 2-3x a day and one 2.75g dose on nights I dont take phenibut 

Weed: small amounts of delta 8 thc in edible form after addy wears off probably around 30mg or so

Nicotine: 6mg vape juice hit frequently (lowered from 50mg)

I want to take a longer break from phenibut but am worried about sleep I've had instances in the past from benzo withdrawal and serotonin syndrome where I wouldnt sleep for days and went crazy . My real goal is to have good sleep consistently, but I find this to be incredibly difficult. I would also like to get off the kratom as well.

I would go to a doctor about the sleep problem, but they never have good solutions drug wise (trazodone is the worst). I love the way I feel when I wake up from phenibut. It makes me feel like I actually slept.
Which is a feeling I need more than anything. 

I've been working to get off the nicotine the most. I am switching to 3mg after Thanksgiving. Have been lowering the kratom dose really gradually. I know the addy isn't great, but I tried quitting and did then tried to quit nicotine and couldn't. Ended up back on both with the kratom that I added to try and help with getting off the addy. 

Any advice on my stack  would be amazing. The main goal is to get restful sleep consistently but getting off anything seems to be hard without sleep. 

My sister recently died from a drug overdose and even though I've made huge progress from a year ago (daily benzo and cocaine addict with nothing going for them besides a useless college degree) I would like to start making more progress while still being able to learn Machine Learning

I started tapering...and things got bad. I would lose conciousness, More importantly...I fell on my dog. We ended up going to the hospital where I thought my entire family wanted to kill me, and my bf was now dating my sister. 

Just got out of the hospital. On baclofen and kpin. Please be careful you guys.

Edit: I keep remembering things that were so real. I thought my bf had done unspeakables to my sisters and broke up with him and screamed at him in front of a bunch of people. He still came to pick me up today. Hurt, and sad of course, but ready to be there for ME. There are some people in our lives that we dont deserve. But would never be able to get by without. Those audio and visual hallucinations are the realest.

Edit edit: its important to note that this was a poly wd situation. None of the substances are to blame. Just me. Sorry I keep adding edits, racing thoughts.",22

I have currently been working to taper my wife off of 750mg per day of Phenibut. She suffered with general anxiety disorder for her life before this. Originally I discovered I have been able to manage my dosage of Phenibut over the last couple years with high doses of faso (tolerance to Phenibut not increasing). We decided to try 750mg per day + 100mg faso for her rather than benzos. This did work and her tolerance did not increase however she felt it was aggravating her GERD and didn't like being dependent on a substance that would require such work to taper off of. 

  


She took 750mg faso cycling down 600mg and 500mg every week then back up to 750mg while she was taking it for 6 months or so. She experienced no w/d during those cycle periods (just diminished recreational effects). We tapered her down pretty low doing 50mg per week to start with only limited anxiety (which to be fair at the time she also discovered she has anemia which has exasperated her anxiety).  


We reached somewhere around 500mg where she decided she wanted to do a faster taper so we began reducing the dose every 3 days by 1/3. We reached the point of 210mg and the anxiety was to the point of only requiring 0.25mg Xanax, usually in the evening (approx. 100mg per faso).  


After that point she made the decision that the 2 week plan I had would just add the suffering and went cold turkey. That was about a week ago.   


Now she is suffering daily depression and anxiety. The anxiety is generally at night. She has been taking about .5mg Xanax per day along with 200mg Faso. We have found that Modafinil does relieve the depression and seemingly the anxiety during the day but the symptoms return significantly when it wears off (and Modafinil has no come-down so I know it's not that).  


Is this a classic case of PAWS? Would one week of cold turkey be long enough to have ended the worst of the symptoms? Obviously .5mg of Xanax per day more than another week or two we want to avoid.   


Or, is this likely just simply her natural anxiety experiencing a rebound because she no longer has the Phenibut to take it away 24/7? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR - My wife tapered down to 210mg per day from 750mg then went cold turkey a week ago. She is experiencing anxiety and depression w/ Fasoracetam - is this normal based on 210mg being so low?",1

I successfully tapered myself off of 4.5gpd of phenibut with baclofen. I'm currently 3 days sober, taking 60mg of baclofen a day (I know that's more than I ""needed"" but I did my taper a bit unconventionally, which I will probably detail in another post). I feel fantastic. The anxiety and panic attacks, the brain fog, the constant worries about withdrawal, all gone. Only thing that hasn't gone away yet is the internal tremors, but they're very mild now. 

But obviously, this is not the end of my journey. I still gotta taper off of the baclofen. For those of you who have done this, how bad is it? What should I expect? I'm going to have to do an at least somewhat fast taper, because I didn't order as much baclofen as I probably should've, I only 90 10mg tablets left. I'm probably gonna drop half a tablet every two or three days and go from there. 

I see people talking about transitioning from phenibut to baclofen a lot on this sub, but I haven't really seen any discussion about what the baclofen taper is like. I'm very interested to hear the experiences and advice of people who have done it.",6

Most nights in the past 6 months, my body feels tired, but my mind is wide awake....and I do not want to take more to make the problem worse. I seriously can't sleep. Most nights I may get 1-3 hours of terrible sleep, or just lie in bed with my eyes closed hoping sleep comes, but never does. I once was up for 50-something hours and still ended sleeping 3-4 hours at the end. I dug myself a huge fucking hole.

I am currently hovering around 5-5.5 GPD which I take in the morning. I'm trying to keep at that for now but the insomnia is getting to me I think because of tolerance withdrawal . The lack of sleep is making me feel like I'm losing my mind. I have tried many cocktails of medication for sleep like klonopin, trazadone, mirtazipine, benadryl. These all used to knock me out before phenibut so I know whats causing this. I need help. I am addicted to this substance.

I'm not sure what to do? I'm currently seeing a psychiatrist and therapist and I'm on the verge of confessing my addiction, but I am afraid of being labeled as ""drug-seeking"" or if they mandate in-patient rehab (which is expensive and now can't afford.) My partner knows everything and she is worried. I can't do this anymore, this shit is fucking poison. Does anyone have any recommendations or advice? Thank you.",3

These are some of the supplements I'm take that have aided me and made me feel much better during the taper:

A good Multivitamin

Magnesium Glycinate: 1000mg/day needs to be taken 2 hours after my last dose of phenibut. The Glycinate version will also help with sleep and anxiety.

Agmatine: This will help lower my tolerance to many drugs.

NAC: This will help with glutamate toxicity 600mg 2x a day.

L-Theanine: This will help with anxiety and sleep. I take some during the day and then take a higher dose at night to help with sleep.

Melatonin: 5-10mg at night",6

I started at 1gpd sometimes 2. It would last me 24 hours. It made me feel euphoric, relaxed yet speedy, feel sharper, and lose a bunch of weight. 

The first time I had none it was scary. I drove to the hospital but changed my mind. The brain fog was a new thing I’d never experienced. 

My dose started to go up and up and when I wasn’t feeling the way it used to make me feel I mixed in gabapentin ( a very stupid move as it only made my tolerance go up)

When I got up to 10gpd I started getting scared I’d never be able to taper. I ordered 125g and planned on tapering but never did. The really good brands of phenibut were either not sold anymore or out of stock, so I was forced to go to liftmode. No offense to that company but blue brain boost and nootropics depot had way higher quality phenibut. 

I got up to 13gpd and started trying to find a place I could order Baclofen from. I continued going up because I wasn’t feeling anything except no withdrawal symptoms. I even called a detox near my house but they wouldn’t take me because they’d never heard of phenibut and their insurance wouldn’t cover me if anything happened. 

I ran out once and I had terrible withdrawal symptoms. I was taking a lot of gabapentin to help with the withdrawal but they were only 100mg pills. I felt so restless. Internally ( if that makes sense) and externally. It was torture. 

I got the liftmode phenibut and it wasn’t all powdered. A lot of it had stuck together like it was old. They reimbursed me and I ordered FAA for the first time. However it didn’t dissolve in water like HCL, so I had to order HCL and went through withdrawal again. 

Now I was up to 15gpd. It was causing weird side effects like I would get angry very easily. 
One day I took my dose and then saw my doctor. I asked for ambien because I wasn’t sleeping well, and she gave me 10 10 mg pills. 

I got home and took one and I felt relaxed but couldn’t sleep. I ended up taking all 10 pills and still couldn’t sleep. I wasn’t even tired. I didn’t sleep for 2 days straight which I figured was from the phenibut so I stopped ct. 

I started having severe muscle spasms that looked like I had some kind of muscle disorder. I decided to go to the ER. I took 100mg phenibut and it helped 1% of the spasms. My mom drove me. 

In the ER I begged for flumazenil ( benzo antidote) because I was convinced I’d overdosed. The very sweet Er doctor said considering how high my dose was I could either go into a coma or die. I was crying hysterically. My mom pointed out my muscle spasms getting worse. They gave me IV Ativan and I literally only felt it for a second. I think the phenibut abuse had fucked up my gaba receptors. 

The doctor gave me a prescription for 5 .5 Ativan and when I got home I took all of them and fell into a delirious sleep where I also visually hallucinated. I then decided to confess to my psychiatrist. 

He had never heard of it so I told him baclofen was what was recommended for getting off phenibut. He said Gabapentin would be better but I said no because I’d been mixing that with phenibut. He upped my klonopin to 1.5mg a day for either a week or two and put me on baclofen 10X3 a day. I told him 30mg wasn’t enough but he said he’d put me in inpatient detox if it wasn’t enough so I sucked it up. 

I went through the klonopin pretty fast and was left with just baclofen which didn’t help me sleep at all. Then I asked to switch to lyrica but he only gave me 100mg and then switched it to 150. I was still getting withdrawal symptoms so I went back to the baclofen. Then I got a package in the mail. It was a box of 100 Etilaam 1mg. That’s a brand of etizolam. I’d forgotten I’d ordered it. 

I took 1 ( ever since the phenibut turned on me I was terrified of taking anything from the mail) and it immediately relaxed me. From then on I took 1-2mg a day with my baclofen and had no symptoms. 
I never went back to phenibut again. 
Edit- even though the etizolam was helpful, I ended up just going into another addiction so to anyone reading this please be careful. I wouldn’t wish with addiction on my worst enemy.",6

Kratom May Be The Reason,"Before I start talking about my personal experience I want to say that I do not speak on behalf of everyone who has taken phenibut and attempted to stop. Everyone’s body chemistry is different so one person’s experience can be totally different than someone else’s. 

So I’ve been taking Phenibut on and off for about 4+ years now to combat my bad anxiety. Took it daily for about 2 years straight then stopped for about 6 months and picked it back up again when my wife passed away because my anxiety and depression started coming back. Since my wife passed away mid 2018 until a couple weeks ago 2020 I’ve been taking about 2.5-3.5 grams DAILY (one large dose in the morning). I decided to quit again for the second time in my life, and just like the first time quitting I felt ZERO withdrawal symptoms. I read so many horror posts of people going through extremely painful withdrawals after quitting phenibut but in all honesty I’ve felt nothing. Maybe a little bit of uncomfortable anxiety/irritability a couple nights, but other than that, its been very easy. I thought I got lucky the first time when I quit and was worried about withdrawals happening this time around, but once again I felt nothing both times. 

So I asked myself how? What am I doing differently than others that is making me not feel any withdrawal symptoms? Then it hit me.... “KRATOM!!!”

Before I quit the first time, one of my friends introduced me to Kratom as he believes if I were to take something for anxiety it would be better for it to be something natural rather than something made in a lab like phenibut. So I took it for a couple weeks before quitting phenibut and once I stopped taking phenibut there was enough daily kratom in my system to combat any withdrawals. 

I’ve been on Kratom (red Bali) ever since, and even when I picked up phenibut again for the past 2 years I’ve been taking it along side the red Bali kratom and so when I quit phenibut recently for the second time I truly believe that the kratom I’m taking is what’s helping my body cope with the withdrawal effects of phenibut. 

Can I prove this? No. Is there scientific studies that support this? Probably not. Do I believe it’s what helped me personally? Yes, either that or maybe my body chemistry is different than most people I don’t know. Either way it was something worth sharing with others who may find this beneficial or worth trying while they are tapering or quitting phenibut. 

Also, just to be clear, I don’t think that Kratom is a magic plant that one should take daily, just like everything else, one should take it with caution and moderation because over time, you WILL develop an addiction to it and kratom withdrawals are also real VERY real.

Good luck",1

Over the last 2 weeks, I've worked my way down to 2.5 gpd, albeit with some discomfort.  My last dose was 2.4 g and was 20 hours ago.  I am a little shaky and a little anxious, but doing OK.  Mostly nervous and not knowing what to expect.

I want to CT quit and grind it out for the rest of this week if possible.  I have \~350 gabapentin (300 mgs each) and 15 lorazepam to assist.

Is this doable over the next 5 days while not ending up in the hospital?

EDIT: if you have some knowledge, a brief recommended gabapentin and Ativan dosing schedule would be great.  Thank you everyone!",2
2020-11-16 08:08:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/jv6g5u/final_update/,Final update,"I’m entering my 6th week of being phenibut free. Just wanted to give a final update to give hope to anyone going through detox/tapering/withdrawal. 
Today I’m completely back to my pre-phenibut state of mind, if not slightly better. Granted, part of the “slightly better” is a combined result of sobriety, healthier lifestyle choices and going back on my ssri, Zoloft. Around the 3-4 week of being off phenibut, I was still struggling with overwhelming depression and fatigue. That’s when I decided to go back on Zoloft. Would I feel as good today if I wasn’t on an ssri? I don’t know. Don’t really care. I’m off phenibut, enjoying life again, and grateful to be alive. 
I’ve detoxed and withdrawn from literally every drug and/or combo of substances you can imagine. I have a severe substance abuse problem. In no uncertain terms, phenibut withdrawal is the worst/darkest/longest hell I’ve ever walked through. It seemed like it lasted forever. If I had not been in a total psychosis, I don’t think I would have stayed through it. That being said, it does pass, albeit a very slow recovery. (For me, anyway) This is a great community. Take advantage of it. It really, really helped me during the paranoid hypomanic, sleepless nights. 
The only issue I still struggle with is related to my addict brain, not really phenibut. I still miss having some sort of immediate gratification to boost my mood. When I’m on my way out, I still have the immediate thought, “what can I take to make this more fun” or “let me keep something in my purse IN CASE I start feeling bad or bored or whatever.” Luckily, since I associate phenibut with the hell of withdrawal, my brain never considers phenibut..: but..: this is def something I need to work on so I don’t end up in another random Quitting [insert recreational substance] sub in 6 months. 
Good luck to everyone still struggling today. Despite what your brain might be saying, it really does get better.",32

Should I taper?,"I used to use phenibut once per week with at about 2500 milligrams per dose and that was over a year ago and experienced some pretty bad withdrawal when I stopped, it was very surprising. I just recently decided to try using it again and used it twice this week with three days in between doses.  I took 1.7 grams last Tuesday and yesterday (Saturday) I took 1 gram. Now it is Sunday night and I feel like I'm starting to go into withdrawal again. It's horrible, I didn't think that it could happen with this lower dose and was sure that I gave myself enough time in between these doses. I'm completely done with this substance. My question is, do you think I should taper down even though my use has been so brief. I don't want to take more and accidentally make things worse but if taking half a gram and then 250 milligrams after that and then maybe 50 or something could make this process smoother I might want to do that. Maybe it's just rebound but I've had my fair share of alcohol detoxes and this feels very similar to the beginning of gaba withdrawal. Last time I went through what withdrawal I had from phenibut I decided against stepping down gradually for the same reasons I'm worried about doing it now and it was an extremely hellish week.

Not sure if I should taper to 1-5mg. The goal is to have almost no long term side effects. I c/t'd benzos many years ago and learned the horrors of not slowly tapering gabaergics.Any input?

follow up edit:Ok, it's been about 72hrs no phen. I feel fine. After 36hrs I took 1mg lorazepam and that let me cope with intense headache at night then sleep. Lorazepam is wearing off now but I feel fine. I think with highest doses of phen like 500-1000+mg it stays in your system much longer than like 10mg. With at 10mg/day I was probably already relatively ""sober"" for hours of the day. It was mostly my receptors expecting the phen, more than wd or anything. For me, worst symptoms of gaba wd are where upper jaw of my teeth get a bit crowded/bucktooth but that has not happened so I think I'm good. I'll follow up later in a few days to be sure.

I am free after an almost 5 year habit, Atleast 3 of those years daily with no breaks. I got up to about 2.5g at my max most of the use was about 1.5g.

I started my taper in January after realizing how awful just stopping was (don’t do it). I tried various methods and supplements to assist but settled on 10mg a day decrease with agmatine, theanine, magnesium, and kava for help. I went up and down ALOT. I finally got serious enough to get down to 200mg and then after 5 days I threw out all but a couple grams. 
Well, the couple gram temptation became too much after 8 days off so for 3 days I took varying 500mg-1.25g doses. After I ran out I felt like ass for a few days but powered through and now I am 12 days quit! I feel great overall! I am honestly already 90 percent back to my old self.

Ever since quitting I’ve just been in this horrible anhedonia slump, no motivation to do anything ever, I don’t give a shit about anything, daily suicidal thoughts when thinking about all of the bullshit I have to figure out to get my life back on track etc. I continually quit jobs and end up having to stress about money, I got a DUI when I passed out from a combo of staying up all night on adderall during my taper and passing out in my parked car when I dosed phenibut again (they let me drive home afterwords but I have a warrant now and have since sold my car since driving gives me too much anxiety).

Nothing seems to be getting better and honestly life was so much better even at the peak of my phenibut addiction. I had motivation to do things and I wasn’t so anxious that I couldn’t pursue my dreams while at the same time being too scared to do anything more than work from home. I have severe ADD (even before quitting phenibut) and my health insurance doesn’t cover mental health services so I can’t afford a legitimate prescription to ADD meds which also really adds to the mental fuckery of all of this.

Is this all related to quitting phenibut? Honestly the only thing keeping me from ending it all is the thought that someday I might get through this and end up where I’m trying to go. Everyday though that dream becomes less and less visible, I’m not sure how I’m going to pay rent this month, I don’t talk to my family anymore because I’m too much of a failure to face them at all and outside of that I’m so fucking alone in life. All I can think about since quitting is how much I hate myself for getting myself into this situation and it’s all due to the self medicating I started when I was 16 years old after my little brother passed away from cancer and my parents went through A very sudden divorce which tore my family in half. I just want to end it all because all I can see are my options being endless substance abuse to even be able to function like a normal person or eventually using my last 40 bucks to buy a helium tank and use my sleep apnea CPAP mask to exit bag myself into a blissful infinite sleep which honestly, is the only part of my life that I look forward too anymore anyways. 

The worlds already fucked and if we all die in the end anyways what’s the point of living if you don’t have the spite to follow your dreams to stick it to the universe anyways? I sure as fuck know I don’t i guess. I haven’t had the motivation to clean my room for 6 months and now I just spend all my time getting fucked up on whatever I can afford and watching YouTube surrounded by moldy dishes and moldy mostly empty 40oz liquor bottles. The thought of suicide is the only thing that brings me comfort anymore and I’m already on Wellbutrin and celexa because that’s the only thing my dr would perscribe me without making me go

I was using for 1.5 years and quit cold turkey along with Meth,Heroin,gabbapentin, Valium and suboxone before the H. 

So the first 7 days in detox were the hardest days I may have ever gone through. Not because it was the single most physically brutal W/d’s, but that I had always prided myself on my strong will. That I could make it through really hard things. But I would find myself in such an intense depression and anxiety(panic attack nonstop) that all I wanted to do was run away. This type had just mentally destroyed my morale. 

I’ve been clean off of everything for 4 months but I’ve noticed my phenibut has increased lately and my Kratom is back to at least 2-3 times a day ( Kratom i am okay with if it means never using heroin again). But I feel like it’s too late to cold turkey off phenibut, also I don’t think it’s doing anything for me. 

I can’t tell when I’ve taken it or not. (Except when I forget and my anxiety is increased.) I find that when I don’t take it and have any bit of anxiety. My body increases my anxiety to get attention saying “I need the phenibut you can’t handle this without it” and if I wait like a day or two to take phenibut and my anxiety is already really high. I will dose again but after I dose I have more anxiety then before I stopped taking or even pain 10-12 hours after not taking it.",1

I'm genuinely looking for answers, decided to start tapering as well. I've looked at many experiences of people quitting phenibut but never with these types of side effects (even when maintaining their same daily dose)  


""  
So I’ve been taking phenibut HCL daily for around 3.5 years now, it’s for anxiety & depression purposes. Taken once in the morning completely changed my life for the better.

started at 750 & found my sweet spot @ 3 -3,750 GPD without any problems for the first 2.5 years.

After that, I kept getting these weird left leg vibrations that messed up with my mood & productivity. couldn’t sleep well at night. I was/still do, take some dopaminergic & cholinergic nootropics with it once in the morning like cdp choline, piracetam & Nalt.

After weeks of misery, I tried to up my dose to 4-4.5 GPD once in the morning & the vibrations went away. (not sure if that actually solved it)

The past couple of months I got the same thing again, but this time with hand tremors & whole body shaking as if being in a constant withdrawal state no matter if I redosed. I even upped the daily dose to 5-6 GPD for a couple of weeks without any help. Now I’m back to 4.2-4.5 GPD - I’m not sure what is going on.

I saw some people here mentioning Glutamate surges, which got me on Agmatine/Magnesium in hopes of a fix. But I’m not sure it’s helping. The hand tremors indicate low dopamine perhaps? But I take CDP-choline/Nalt/ALCAR & B vitamins almost daily So I don’t know if that’s possible.

Has anyone had similar issues & successfully overcame them?

My dose is normally around 1G a day. 3 days ago I quit taking kratom from about a 4 month beige. I had been off it for about 6 months before that and a steady user for 2 years before that. I’m done with that shit. It’s WRECKING my testosterone, so that is not an option during these with draws. I just today got an order of 90 300mg gabapentin. I’m quitting the phenny Cold Turkey cuz I ran out today and will not buy more.

The past couple of weeks I have tried going 2 or 3 days without and I for real feel like I’m going to loose touch with reality. I feel like I’m on the verge just barely teetering on the edge of having the most intense panic attack of my life. But it feels worse than just a panic attack, it literally feels like I’m going to snap into psychosis or go running around screaming and doing something crazy. It feels like I’m going to black out of reality out of the feeling of pure terror. Luckily I have not tipped over that edge just yet but I’m afraid that’s going to happen. I work in an operating room on a daily basis involved in surgery so I can’t sneak out during long operations to re-dose or do anything. And obviously having one of these panic attacks while operating would be pretty catastrophic for the patient and everyone else involved. I am not a surgeon let me be clear on that. I have never had a real panic attack before and I am generally a very easy-going blowingZaidi person. But this feeling is almost exactly like when you can tell that an acid trip is about to go bad. It feels like right before you start having a bad acid trip. They are of course is powerful feelings of anxiety and can’t sleep for shit. It feels like everything in the world is wrong and that sucks but I can get used to that. It’s this feeling that I’m about to go insane that is so terrifying to me. Has anyone else experienced this?

How much is the gabapentin going to help with the withdrawals? And what’s the best scheduled to take these things. How much of an effect should I expect it to have on the anxiety and the panic and the overall withdrawal experience?

have been trying to taper down slowly, but the end feeling is something like a lite withdrawal. 

i used to nod off at night if i got bored enough at that high dose. id nod off and sleep maybe like 1-2 hrs. now its that recognizeable sleep where youre not actually sleeping. 

i always get that sleep quality when quitting phen. youre laying there and the brain is kind of shut down, but youre still barely awake. youre still aware of your body, no real shut down. its a hell.

i tapered it 1g/week over the course of 2.5 weeks until serious anxiety stepped in and made me recalibrate. i switched to ~10% taper every 2 weeks, but this minor withdrawal period only kicked in after i recalibrated that way.

im thinking abt upping the dosage and cutting back even slower but that would be such a long time to get off this. im going to a psychiatrist soon to get their input. i want to just get off phen and maybe do a gabapeptin/benzo taper.

at a loss for what routes are best. any ideas? maybe i go for that 1g/week and get benzos from doctor to manage anxiety idk.",1

I went to pick it up this morning and...the package facility at my apartment is busted, so I haven't been able to pick it up and continue my taper. Needless to say, I'm cold turkey right now. I ordered another 100 gram on UPS overnight, to have it shipped to a UPS store but it won't get there until tomorrow.

I've never WD'd before and I'm pretty nervous. I bought some Melatonin + L Theanine to help me sleep and I was able to scrape 1G from my remaining supply. Will I get any sleep tonight? Is there anything else I can do to help my odds?",3

Okay guys I’ve been taking around 9 grams a day for about 3 months now. 
The other night I took two of my lunesta and my dad found me passed out on the floor and I wasn’t breathing. So he called 911 and smacked me and I finally woke up.i took 9 grams of phenibut that day I blamed it all on the lunesta so they took that away.


Well today I took my 9 grams and then some gabapentin. I ended nodding off on the couch and when he found me he told me I was blue and cold. He smacked me awake and then broke a bunch of shit and screamed at me. I finally told him I was taking phenibut and he took the bottle out of my purses.

I have one more bottle of 300 capsules and I can’t order anymore because he knows I’ve been ordering it online. T

I need to taper with this last bottle and then jump off.

I am also currently on suboxone but I know that doesn’ help with phenibut withdrawals.
I guess I’m just asking for advice and a taper plan.

I feel absolutely terrible. Two years ago my brother od on heroin and passed away. My dad found him. When he found me on the floor the other night he thought I was dead. 

I went to rehab 2 years ago and got put on subs. I started taking phenibut because I read it helps with sub tapering but now I have a whole new problem.

I know this is long so if you’ve read this far thank you ❤️

Scheduled to be delivered tomorrow by 4:30, but fed ex usually comes earlier. I took the last of what I had left about 3 hours ago which was about 1.5g. I've been taking about 3.5g a day for two months. About 30 minutes ago, I had this chill go down the back of my head and my heart started pounding (this is usually how my panic attacks start) but luckily I was able to calm myself down but it was pretty sketch for a sec. I got shaky but it has, for the moment, mostly subsided. 
I guess my question is this in my head do you think? Psyching myself out? I am prescribed lyrica and I take 300mg twice a day, one in the morning one in the afternoon. I did that today + another one just now. So 900mg total. 
I was taking about 3g upon waking up in the morning and maybe another 500mg later in the day. 
I tried to wait as long as I could to take the last of it but it was only a little over 1/3 of what I usually take.

*** well ladies and gentlemen I guess from my addiction experiences of all types of drugs I was able to dodge severe withdrawal from 15g of phenibut. With some help of kratom, and Gabs 300mg.

I'm doing the 10% per week taper till I get to 1gpd then it's 50-100mg drop depending on how I feel. This is what my taper is looking like and the meds I'm using to help me.

Week 1: 2.5gpd - dropped 500mg the first week; everything went smoothly.

Week 2: 2.2 gpd - dropped 300mg that week; still going well

Current Week(3): 2gpd - dropped 200mg this week; my ears started ringing, but I'm sticking it out!

Week 4: 1.8gpd - dropping 200mg next week

ect...

Helper meds I've been precribed these before I even started using phenibut:

Klonopin: 2mg/day

Gabapentin: 1800mg/day - I don't take this every day so I always have extra and on days I'm feeling crappy I take up to 3600mg/day

Supplements:

Agmantine: 2.5gpd taken with my dose of phenibut

NAC: 1200mg/day 600mg in the morning and 600mg at night

Magnesium Glycinate: 1000mg/day taken at night 2 hours after my last dose of phenibut.

Melatonin: 4-8mg/day depending on how I slept the last night.

Multivitamin: Now Adam Softgels just for general health.

So far I'm doing very well and hope the taper continues that this way and I'm able to get off of this toxic substance for good.",3

[Trip to ER](https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/jngam6/went_to_the_er_last_night_need_help_figuring_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Things got better for a few days then on Friday, I woke up with the worst anxiety I’ve ever experienced. It progressed into delirium. Literal hell. Hallucinations, head spinning so bad I had to hold the wall while I was walking around, trouble breathing, nauseous, writhing around in bed. I spent the entire day and the night like that. Didn’t sleep a wink. By 6 am Saturday I genuinely thought I was dying.

Finally my girlfriend convinced me to call my mom. I called her, broke down and explained everything. She took me to the ER, I brought the phenibut and showed the doctor. Of course the doctor had never heard of it. He made some calls to Vanderbilt and a few other places and finally figured out what it is. I can’t stress how much of a relief it was to find a doctor who actually listened and spent time doing research about it. He decided to put me on Valium, 5 mg every 6 hours and admitted me overnight for observation. The Valium actually worked.

I spent the night in observation, taking Valium every 6 hours and I actually managed to get a little sleep. Aside from my roommate who was withdrawing from alcohol and spent the night yelling gibberish and whistling for a non-existent dog. They ran some more tests on me this morning, made sure nothing was wrong with my heart, then discharged me with a 3 day supply of Valium and a referral to a GP who is going to start me on a slow benzo taper over the next few months.

I feel like shit for what I’ve put my girlfriend and my family through because of all this, but I had no choice. I’m resting at home now. I just want to say that if you’re ever in a similar situation to mine bite the bullet and go get help. I’m probably going to be thousands in debt because of all this but no amount of money is worth your mental and physical health. I’m just happy I didn’t try to tough it out on my own. Thank you to everyone here who gave me advice and support. And if you’re still taking phenibut and able to taper, do it now. Nothing is worth what I had to go through. Everything was fine for a year and a half, and then it completely switched on me. It could happen to anyone. 

Be safe. And thanks to everyone again.

I know this is a wall of text, but I am very grateful if anyone takes the time to read it :)


However, my questions and an additional TLDR are at the end if you just wanna skip ;)


First a little introduction to myself: 
I am currently 30yo and smoked cannabis on a daily basis for almost 10 years and stopped it 5 years ago completely from one to another day and never touched it again (I had a reason to stop back then).


But after some years, I missed my daily routine of taking some subtances and found out about Kratom and Phenibut which is legal in my country, easy to get and not that expensive and they both got my interest..


Since then I've been using Kratom and Phenibut in combination for almost 1.5 years now, every day with no exception. I was even aware about tolerance and the addiction from the beginning, but it didn't stop me from taking it daily..

I usually take every 1-2 hours a shake with around 3.5g Kratom (up to 5g sometimes) and around 0.35g Phenibut (up to 0.5g on some occasion).

Around 5 times, I even consumed up to 1g Phenibut in a single dose, but this was very very rarely. I drink about 10 (maximum 15) of these shakes each day. (35g Kratom, 3.5g Phenibut on average)
(I will start to write down when and how much of each I consume from now on, just to be able to track this accurately for myself)


It was fine until around 3 months ago. Suddenly I sometimes have weird ""anxiety attacks"", felling very uncomfortable in random situations and it lasts only a few seconds and I'm just fine again after. There was no special event/trigger. Happens when I am alone at home, with friends or in public, makes no difference. I can't really describe/explain those situations, I just feel very uncomfortable and anxiety for a short moment and have kind of weird and sad thoughts. I really can't describe them any better. My thoughts just drift away for a brief moment of time somehow..
I also have sleeping problems from time to time now, which I never had before. I usually sleep for 7-8h, but in the last weeks only for around 5-6h.
These weird thoughts occur more often on days when I haven't sleeped much.


Since I experience this panic situations more frequently, I have made the decision that I must stop taking Phenibut and Kratom.

I don't want to be addicted to those substances anymore and I don't want to risk destroying my psyche (any further).

Until this point I was sure I could stop taking Phenibut and Kratom whenever I want, but I honestly had no reason to. 

But now I am very scared those panic situations will occur even more often when I stop taking Phenibut and I might end up in a depression or psychosis in the worst case..



I want to build my own plan on how to quit Phenibut and Kratom and luckily I found this subreddit.

Was reading a lot of posts and reports here already, but due to my uncomming consuming pattern (I guess), I still have some questions left:



**Should I keep using Kratom while I stop taking phenibut or quit both at the same time?**

I've read in other threads, that people find Kratom helpful when quitting Phenibut.
My goal in the end is of course to stop them both, but since I already take Kratom anyway it might help me.



**I have no idea in which pattern, dosages and how fast I should lower the Phenibut.**

Should I keep the pattern of taking it every 1-2hours and just lower the dose every few days for 50-100mg, or should I also change the pattern from start?

I thought about making a fixed schedule, let's say every 2hours I take Phenibut and just lower that dose of each doses after a few days.
I could also keep the 350mg Phenibut fixed for a while until I lowered the amount of times I take it daily. I really don't know whats better.
Maybe a combination of both?

Even if I don't take that high doses each time, it still adds to a pretty high daily dose though.



I currently have 8 days of vacation until I have to work again and I was hoping to start the process of quitting phenibut and kratom a bit faster at the beginning.

I am aware it might take me weeks or even months till I quit completely and longterm.

So I'm unsure if this is a good idea to boost up the process now or go the safe way, but now I can chill at home and don't have to worry about work.



And sorry for my bad english in general, but I hope it's at least understandable enough and I explained my situation sufficiently.
If I missed out any information, just let me know.



And I hope I didn't break any rules in this subreddit!
I was even unsure if I should post it in /r/quittingphenibut or /r/quittingkratom, but I guess Phenibut requires a lot more effort and knowledge to quit than Kratom and Phenibut is propably
more involved in my current problem than Kratom.



And thanks again for anyone taking the time to read this and help me out with my problem.


I am so grateful for any advice, own experiences, suggestions, tips, links and just anything!


Have a nice weekend guys and sorry again for this wall of text ;)

**TLDR:**
I want to quit Phenibut and Kratom, mainly because of recent sleeping problems and some panic attacks.


My average pattern of daily usage since 1.5 years:

- 10x 0.35g Phenibut (3.5g overall - sometimes ""a bit"" more)

- 10x 3.50g Kratom (35g overall, but also varies a bit)

- Quit both substances together, or with which one to start?

- Prioritize the amount or the count of each dose?

- Start with lowering doses and/or change pattern of consuming?",1

I wanted to quit after but damn I continued as it's slightly helping me being still able to stand up in the morning, go meet people sometimes and work my job and study for the next exam.

Did anyone of you experience the same and developped a similar pattern? I'm now using kratom daily for a bit more than a month.

Last time I got to day four or five I cracked and got a little bit from a friend ""for tapering"" and then cracked again and ordered 100gs online. 

I've been out for 5 days. I certainly could have ordered it online days ago and had it by now but I'm trying to hard to shake it.

I used phenibut for the most part responsibly for 3+ years. When covid lockdown started it just got too tempting and I leaned into It more. The actual fucking problems started after I went back to work. I was only working 2 days a week, so I would dose both of those days... probs like 2ish grams. 

Work very soon got insaaaanely stressful. I started working 4 days a week and I just simply needed it to go to work every day. There was just so much shit going down at my job I felt powerless. This has been going on for months. 

At my worst I maybe used 20g per week. Last week maybe 9g in the 4 days I used. Even when I wasn't out, I would dose 4 days in a row for work and not touch it on my days off, but honestly I started getting sicker and sicker during those 3 days off. 

It's simply just not sustainable. I went cold turkey. Day 3 is always the shittiest. Today I managed to get out of bed and make it to work. I had a few puffs of weed, a red bull and two shots of espresso to get me through the day. Now I'm at home and had a shower and some bali kratom (which I'm also trying to lower/taper/get under control) 

On top of all of this, like most of you I have bad anxiety and depression to begin with. Which is probably why we liked this crazy shit in the first place 🤯

I'm insanely irritable, having the worst insomnia, no appetite, the occasional tremor and hot/cold sweats all day and night.

I'm out of trazodone so I've been using CBD, melotonin and hydroxyzine to sleep but that did not cut it at all last  night. New rule of no caffeine after work and I picked up nyquil and benadryl and gatorade. 

My SAINT of a coworker is going to give me 10 gabapentin for a little bit of weed tomorrow at work.

Even though I felt like the literal physical incarnation of *swamp ass* all day, there are slivers of time where I feel my mood naturally improving. 

I have higher hopes for day 5... Hang in there guys and keep fighting the good fight. Take small victories and improvements for what they are! 

Every time I feel like giving up I come here and read everyone's posts and it keeps me in line.",6

But anyways, I've been feeling brainfog, between doses/on doses, but better than the energetic feeling I had when I was doing 990x2 a day, and my friend had me cut to 700 + 770, and I ended up at 700 10am, and 770 10pm.. But I just feel off... And feel like those months went by too fast.. 

I just felt like I went down too fast from september following my friends guide on cutting from 990x2 to 700 + 770 over a day back in september? Even though it seemed I maintained 700 + 770 since mid october. 

Should I raise my dose a tiny bit , maybe 770x2? Or continue reducing now? As he instructed me, once here (in these dose ranges, 700+770) to start doing -20 to -100.

EDIT: Grammar, specified I was lowered from 990x2, to 700 10am, and 770 10pm in september, over a day. Maintained 700 and 770 since then with the occasional going back up, but then maintained 700 and 770 since mid october trying to figure out supplements before I lowered further.",3

I attempted cold turkey a couple weeks ago and the joint pain, depression, anxiety, insomnia and nightmares were unbearable so I ended up taking it again but I have to get off now because I’m going to be sitting some jail time soon here. What should I mention to my doctor as far as medications go to make the withdrawals as painless as possible? Any advice at all would help. I’m currently prescribed adderall, hydroxyzine, and Prozac. I’m also on probation so I can’t take anything that isn’t prescribed. Thanks a ton",1

I'm still planning on detoxing but want to do it in hospital so I have trained professionals around when i start feeling suicidal. After being scammed by bodyshock I bought from raw powders. This time the phenibut is making me very anxious and stressed though. I can feel sleepy and doppy but there is an extreme feeling of tightened stress muscles and I feel anxious as fuck. Can phenibut do this or have I been scammed again?,1

Started with a gram and now up to three every day. Out of nowhere last Friday, I started getting sick. Withdrawal sick. Which is weird because I’m still taking the same dose I always have. I had a minor panic attack last Saturday that passed after about 30 minutes, but last night I had a major one. I thought I was having a heart attack, and had my girlfriend drive me to the ER. They gave me an IV, did a chest x-ray and ran all kinds of tests and nothing was wrong. They gave me a Xanax and discharged me. At first I thought I was just sick, but now I’m pretty sure it’s the phenibut. 

For some reason, out of nowhere it switched on me. Now even when I take my normal dose I’m wracked with anxiety and I constantly feel like I’m on the verge of another panic attack. I need help. I’ve ordered some agmatine because I’ve read on this forum that it helps, but what else should I do? I feel like such an idiot for letting myself get wrapped up in it like this. I’ve read about baclofen but I have no insurance and no way to see a doctor and explain what’s happening with me. All I’ve seen is shady online pharmacies that take over a month to get here, if they even send them. 

I’m at the end of my rope and I really need some advice on what supplements etc I can take to make this bearable. Thank you for any advice you can give. I’ll try anything at this point. Another question, if I’m having a panic attack will alcohol help?",8

2020-11-02 21:53:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/jn2ftu/quitting_3gpd_habbit/,Quitting 3gpd habbit,"Okay so I've posted here before. I'm trying to quit a 3gpd habbit that I've had for about 3 months now.

What I have to help:

Klonopin: 2mg/day

Gabapentin: 1600mg/day

Depakote: 875mg/day

Prazosin: 2mg/day

Kratom: 10g/day

Melatonin: 8mg/day

B2 Vitamins

Ginger Root: 500mg/day

Magnesium Glycinate: 1000mg/day - from what I've read both gabapentin and Phenibut deplete your magnesium so keeping this up is one of my main priorities.

With these meds I've cut my dosage down to 2000mg/day and I've had minimal symptoms as of the moment the only thing is lack of sleep, but with all the meds + the Kratom it's fine. I will also be getting some temazepam 30mg/day on the 13th.

I've only been taking the Kratom Red Vein Kali for 7 days(which I don't think is a long time) and plan to take a break from it for 48h just so I don't get myself habituated to it and also get a different strain switching to White Vein Indo as to not get so adjusted to the alkaloids in it.

The Depakote + Klonopin + Gabapentin should prevent any seizures and when I get the temazepam it should help me sleep at least a little more than I am. Right now sleeping 2-3h a day without the temazepam. Like I said it doesn't bother me that much other than randomly falling alseep for 20-30 minutes sometime during the day.

Anyone have any other tips for me?",1

whether you still use phenibut, are tapering, going through withdrawals, or have stopped using phenibut altogether, just the fact you’ve joined this sub shows you’re interested in taking the steps to make a change for the better, and that part of you knows it’s possible. whether your goal is to cut down to occasional use or eliminate phenibut from your life altogether, i am proud of you and you are doing great :)",59
2020-11-02 19:44:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/jn0a5i/okay_serious_question_can_i_use_phenibut/,"Okay, serious question! Can I use Phenibut '' recreational ""?","First of all, I'm sorry if this post might look ridiculous. So, it's next. I ABSOLUTELY know all the dangers and have read countless reports of dependencies and harms that Phenibut causes in people, mainly in the issue of addiction. My question is: Would I be okay using Phenibut ONLY once a week? Or would that be harmful in the same way? 

 My goal would be to replace Saturday's alcohol with a little Phenibut, since alcohol doesn't do me much more, and I really have serious problems socializing at social events, so I would definitely limit myself to ONLY once a week, as substituted alcohol. Could this give me the ""sociable"" effects that I'm looking for too? I read several reports of people whose social anxiety benefited a lot from Phenibut to socialize, so that could really give me a light, just thinking here.  

I really want to say once a week, because I am extremely paranoid about addiction issues, BUT, if someone thinks it is impossible to maintain the habit of using it only recreational on the weekend, please be honest and feel free to tell me that this is absolutely a terrible idea.",1

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823863/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150605

from what i’ve gathered (correct me if i’m wrong please), the negative effects of phenibut withdrawal seem to be caused by the sudden reduction in GABA in the brain, and the resulting glutamate sensitivity. while many times this may just be uncomfortable, for many long term users it can be unbearable or downright dangerous (such as in glutamatic excitotoxicity/glutamate storms)

in addition to protection against glutamate induced excitotoxicity, 7,8-DHF has been shown to protect against oxidative stress induced neurotoxicity (higher during withdrawal due to depression/anxiety), improve the symptoms of depression (associated with phenibut withdrawal), as well as enhance memory consolidation and emotional learning in healthy rodents 

i used anywhere from 1g to 5g daily for about a year and quitting has been hell. in my personal experience i have found 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) to be incredibly helpful in reducing the uncomfortable effects of my taper and withdrawal (especially the anxiety), it definitely hasn’t made it easy but helps in taking away that certain “edge”

sorry for the long post, i just wanted to share what has helped me along my journey and hopefully help someone else out there struggling with something similar.

Quick note, I only took phenibut daily for about 2 months and was between 1.5-2 gpd so idk how well this would work for someone who has a higher tolerance or longer dependency, but I tried CT and it was fucking awful so I tapered -50mg per day on dose and once I made it down to 250 I used 250 for about half a week then did every other day for about a week, then every 3rd day for a week and then ever 4 days 3 times and I felt like my body was telling me it was ok to actually quit and im on day 5 with zero negative withdrawl effects and I feel like 90% my normal self.

I have bought some supplements ashwagandha, 5 htp, taurine and magnesium which seem to help me sleep better along with my 10mg valium. But I still feel depressed. Do I just need to wait for my dopamine receptors to heal? It's been 6 days and I'm not doing as terribly as I thought I would be, but I'm still not happy and if I could I'd sleep all day. I'm trying to distract myself with work (I run a small buisness) and comedy movies but motivation is still very hard. It's the 6th day for me. When did you start to feel a bit happier and actually want to stay awake during the day? I'm also wondering if I should stop my anti phycotics because I'm not actually phycotic I have them for anxiety but I know they supress domapine so maybe it would end up making me more depressed? I'm not sure.",3
