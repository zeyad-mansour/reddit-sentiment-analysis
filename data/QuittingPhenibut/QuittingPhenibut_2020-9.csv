I've been getting more and more into stimulants over the last few months. I only recently came across Phenibut.

At first, I felt like giving it a try. Now, I don't just do anything at ""random"". I first do extensive research, look at anecdotes and then very slowly proceed to my testing phase. Heck, I even have a strong cycling schedule *just* for caffeine.

I was surprised to learn that there was an actual subreddit for quitting Phenibut?

That's why I wanted to ask:

**If the downside of Phenibut is so bad, what made people choose for Phenibut to begin with?**

I'm not saying this from a place of condescension, I'm genuinely asking because I don't want to make a mistake by taking Phenibut...

What I'm really wondering is:

**What does Phenibut have (or give) that other nootropics don't have?** 

(Such as Noopept, Phenylpiracetam (or other racetams), Sulbliamine and combined with others substances (such as L-Tyrosine, ALCAR, caffeine/L-theanine, and so on))

I must admit: I'm coming from a place of 99% ignorance about Phenibut.

I've been having decent results with all the ones I listed above.

&#x200B;

Any info on this, answer or thoughts are really appreciated.

  
And I wish you all well with your journeys.",5,{},"{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.5554182529449463}"

Today is my day off work, so I’ve been planning to catch up on my class that I’m starting to fall behind on, but apparently my pharmacy had misplaced my prescription for vyvanse and had to talk with my doctor’s office to send another one in order to get the fill I need. That means that I’m now dealing with 2 sets of withdrawals. Luckily I still had about half a pill of vyvanse saved up for circumstances like this, but it’s not enough to entirely hold back the mental fog that comes with vyvanse withdrawal. I had already taken my first dose of phenibut, which was only 1g, this morning around 11am. I was originally planning to wait until 4 or 5pm for the next dose of 1.1g, then another 1.1g around 11pm before bed, so 3.2g in total. However, around 2:15, it’s about 2:30 as of this post, I took 2g out of phenibut in a desperate hope that it’ll give me enough functionality and clarity to do what I need to do. I suppose I didn’t TECHNICALLY go over my daily amount and maybe I could still continue my taper as normal after today, but I don’t know. I guess I’ll have to play it by ear for now. I would appreciate any suggestions on what I should do",7,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9989109039306641}"

I quit CT, and my psychiatrist gave me 5mg of klonopin to spread out for sleep only. I've done 2 similar binges in teh past (one in june and one like a year ago), and they always suck.

The first day without phenibut is a bummer. I'm depressed and sad, I move slowly, and the anxiety becomes significant enough that I don't leave the house. By 36 hours, I'm shaking in bed paranoid. When I shower I hear voices in the water. By 72 hours, it starts letting up just a little. From 72-96 hours, it comes and goes in waves, and the relief is nearly euphoric. Only by day 4 will klonopin let me sleep more than 5 hours at a time, and I tried up to 1.25mg on day 2 this time.

&#x200B;

Well, today was day 5. I had a great day. My anxiety came and went in waves, but never got worse than ""pre-exam"" anxiety, and between waves, I was able to live life like a normal human. I longboarded around campus, left the appartment 4 times, and even started conversation in lines. I'm so glad it's over.

&#x200B;

I catalogued this experience so that I can read back on it, but also if there are any other binge users who want a timeline.

Of note, I also quit a 15gpd kratom habit at the same time, though only used kratom for 2.5 months or so, and really only every other week this month. Still not fully recovered from kratom, which I think is the source of my lingering insomnia and mood lability.

Needless to say I should have known better than to cold turkey when I was that physically addicted but I wasn’t even getting much effect at that point so I started using GHB occasionally to get the high back. I was probably frying my GABA receptors as phen and ghb both work on the GABA-B receptor. to summarize the withdrawals where so bad I was hospitalized for nearly a week and spent a night in intensive care after I had a  full blown psychotic episode (I don’t remember this). I didnt sleep or eat for three days until the hospital gave me three IV’s of valium and precedex to knock me out. the anxiety was so bad that visibly shaking, dilated pupils and full on hallucinations, I thought my bedroom was a train station and asked my dad where I was; also thought joe biden was trying to frame me at one point, I even forgot how to speak spanish at one point (im a fluent speaker). sounds ridiculous but it happened. Ended up in the hospital detox for three days where they loaded me up with baclofen and barbiturates. After two weeks my sleep is still shit and Im having some confusion/memory loss but fortunately my anxiety is gone and im feeling 75% back to normal. Point is phenibut withdrawal is absolutely insane; ive been through benzo withdrawals and this was much worse, given I was using GHB and phenibut concurrently during the last month. I cant say ill never use again but for now im feeling good sober.

For the past 3years i'm using kratom with phenibut together,last two  years i'm using it everyday,few times a day. Phenibut dosage is always not less than 500mg,goes to 1g. And kratom is not less than 15g but usualy goes around 20/25g per day.
As of phenibut - i don't even feel it. I just do it every morning because i'm afraid if i stop,i will kill somebody. I'm constantly trying to taper down,but as soon as i go 2 days without phenibut i start using again either because i start to feel very angry and depressed or i feel good and there comes a thought that its not that bad,so i can up my dose to 1gram again. Fucking ridiculous it is and i feel like i'm in deep ahit with this. Kratom is another addiction that is absolutely taken my soul. The biggest problem with these addictions are that when you look at me,i look completely healthy and i am ussually in a good mood. I work out quite alot (boxing ,gym,jump rope) ,i try to eat more greens and generally feel pretty good most of the days. But sometimes (ussually in the evening) this huge depressive truth strikes me,that boy oh boy, i'm already 3 years starting my day with drugs,spending my day with them,and going to sleep with them. Substances is a big part of my life. I'm genuenly interested in them. I extract my own DMT from plants,grow magic mushrooms,i reaearch a lot. But theres this thing that i wake up in the morning,drink strong coffee,take 500mg of phenibut, 3,5g of kratom ,and only THEN i am ok.... and in the evening i constantly vape kanna extract,smoke weed ,vape nic salts,take more kratom and it just goes on and on and on and on. I tried to seek for help,but they said i need to go to detox where they will give me 100mg of diazepam and then prescribe tons of antidepressants... ok so how is that better than me using plants and phenibut??? I feel like this problem related to my childhood trauma when parents were divorcing,but i don't know how to uproach it. I drank ayahuasca 2 times and saw the real truth. That was nice but i'm still in this constant cycle of using something. Sometimes i even think that it would be better if i would use heroin or meth,at least then you can see and know that i'm fucked up and i need help. Now ,when i say this to someone,everybody sais that i should just relax... but this thing of not being able to just BE without anything at least a little bit altering my state of conciousness is killing me. I am 31 year old guy. I want to have a child with my girlfriend (shes also addicted to kratom) but i definetly dont want to be this type of dad...

I abused this substance. Perhaps individuals with more discipline can utilize this substance to its maximum efficiency. I’m 40 years old and I worry at times that I’ve ruined my brain. I’ve never paced so much in my life. I long for my old self before phenibut as deficient as it was. I love to read, and I have books, newspapers, and magazines piling up because I cannot sit still and focus. I pace instead. Suicide is not an option because I have people who depend upon me, I do not even own the right to end my life. One just wants the misery to end. Sometimes I ask myself what the fuck have I got myself into with phenibut? What a huge mistake. It’s insidious how you don’t even realize how dependent you are on this stuff. It becomes hot or miss as to whether you can even notice its effect. Then when you try to lower or control your use, you realize how much you need it simply to function. Checking into a mental hospital is considered. Suicide is considered. Not being able to enjoy much of anything is taxing. It really makes one decide why to live. For higher reasons like your children and family. To be in a flow to be engrossed in what your doing, to lose yourself in what you’re doing is a huge part of happiness. That is what phenibut can give you when it works. However in withdrawal it can take that away completely. Your sense of time is greatly affected by this substance. Time can fly by or it drag on. It creeps up on you how you need this to feel “normal.” A you take more next time, and take “a little” on off days to mitigate the withdrawal. Next thing you know you are taking sonar form of it daily. Then you think what the hell have I done. What a mistake. Perhaps I’m being dramatic. For those who have discipline this may seem a bit much. Again I blame myself but because this substance has the potential to ruin pea life perhaps it ought to be controlled. I’m not one for government regulation. I think weed should be legal. But maybe it’s too dangerous a substance in the hands of a fool such as myself. One hopes that their brains can get back to normal. Withdrawals get from this constantly feels like one is not their usual self. To be a shell of ones self is awful. The hyper focus is intoxicating. And when it’s gone it’s difficult. Maybe underlying mental conditions are exasperated with phenibut withdrawal. Maybe people who are prone to depression and anxiety ought not touch the stuff. Bottom line is this is more dangerous than supplements such as kava and Kratom. I wish I could have used it responsibly, but tolerance kicked in and it got out of hand. Like and drug. Playing with Fire will get one in trouble. Perhaps if one has no mental illness and has good discipline phenibut is a good substance. For the rest of us, maybe not. Depersonalization is no joke and is quite scary. You wonder who the hell am I? Maybe tapering too quickly can induce psychosis you just hope it gets better and you can return to normal.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9960676431655884}"

It just feels almost like a weak 9v battery applied to the back of the brain. (Not brain zaps)

Since I was not taking much, I made the instant swap to 20mg baclofen 2x a day. For the 1st time in years...my mood was stable. The baclofen did not produce any high like phenibut therefor no crash or gaba exhaustion, and no other WD.

&#x200B;

Then night 3 came around which is typically the harshest given the phenibut halflife and to my surprise, I only had insomnia....when it got to 4am, I had to get some shut eye so took 300mg of phenibut and went to sleep. Night 4 came and I was so tired from night 3, I slept no problem without any phenibut. Night 5, 6, 7-10 came and went, no phenibut so I started tapering the baclofen and am now clean.

But my doses got up to 10g at the end of those 8 days, so I'm in for some hell. My psychiatrist gave me 5mg of klonopin and free reign over dosing protocol.

He's helped me before with binges, and I used to just take 0.5mg for 4 nights, then 0.25mg for 4 nights. I only used the klonopin to sleep, and I suffered through the days. However, those relapses were during the summer, and this one requires lots of homework, class, labs etc.

I'm 48 hours clean now, and I'm hoping that the all day primal anxiety is done by 96 hours as it generally is for me.

So, would you recommend only using benzos for sleep? Or should I take 0.25mg during the day time and 0.5mg at night? I don't wanna form a new dependence, and I need my night time dose to work so I can sleep.


I also quit kratom after a minor relapse (19/22 days), I'm now 24 hours clean from it. I'm not expecting it to be too bad, and I'm hoping the worst of that withdrawal is also done before my 6h of class day on Monday!

My anxiety and depression have been getting much worse, and I’ve been having more nightmares. Last night I took my first Prozac in I don’t know how long, and even though I only slept for about 4 hours, the nightmares weren’t as intense and I don’t feel as bad as I did yesterday.

Filled up my last cap and luckily found another, but thats all im working with til Saturday. Been sitting at 2.5g for months now because during covid i really spiraled with my depression and anxiety and picked up other habits. 

Im a bit worried but at the same time work tomorrow will take my mind off of it (air conditioning its so hot you dont have much time to think about how bad your anxiety is, shaking, etc.. atleast i hope thats the case. I've really got endless gabapentin too luckily Which i know will eliminate 80% of withdrawal. Have xanax (dependent .5-1mg per day, will dose a little higher if needed) and kratom which i used to get off oxy so that wont be helpful.

Don't know the point of this post, just wanted to put into writing what my 2 days without phenibut will look like at 2.5gpd. I must say i think it will be alright after reading what i wrote. I have the helper meds to get me through this. 

Thanks for reading and please comment thoughts on how you think it should go.

Also i feel like many people on here don't know this as I've seen this written a lot, but phenibut only has a half life of around ~5.3 hours. Not around 16-24 hours which I've seen posted a bunch. That's why withdrawal peaks at day 3, if it had a half life that long withdrawal would peak probably at around the 5 day- 1 week mark.

Went from every other day, to daily for tapering.","My friend and I have been planning my phenibut taper.. Since he knows quite a lot about neurology and phenibut aswell. 


I got dependent from using 1.5g+ 550 and sometimes I'll add 250 in, every other day, or every 48 hours since december. And had to start daily tapering because my days off felt, extremely uncomfortable and my friend swept in and told me I was kindling my self the whole time and suggested/urged to start daily, and taper now. rather than tapering from every other day.

And I originally was going to taper, 990 + 990 + 300. Or 1140 + 1140. Was already doing 990 every 12 hours since the 7th trying to start my taper, but I was feeling uncomfortable still, even after dosing, when I was doing just 990 every 12 hours, which is why I added 300mg, which helped... sort of? 


And he said this is doubling my dose, I'm confused on that. Is it due to the half life of phenibut? Since I thought I'd add up my dose I did every other day (every 48 hours), and split in, subtracting -50 from it. And said to immediately reduce to 800 + 600 or 700. Which is just 1.5g every 24 hours, or 1.5gpd.


Why did he choose this, and why did he say my way I was ""doubling"" the amount, I should've tapered from the beginning on the 7th?


I continued with what he said and rather than taking 990 for my 12th hour dose tonight, I just took 800mg, and I feel... fine? And felt fine quicker, as if it actually kicked in. And feels better than when I did 990x2? What black magic fuckery is this that he pulled? I thought it would make more sense to just add up all of my doses I did every other day, and taper from that, daily? Does this just all come down to half life of phenibut?

Sorry if this is a stupid question, and lengthy post for a stupid question.. But I'm wondering how... this should work better, than what I had in my head? When I thought this was way lower than I thought I should be taking, for daily taper, since I had 2g-2.3g every other day.. So I'm just guessing he said it was ""doubled"" because when I started daily, it comes down to half life?


My last question is... when I did 990x2 since the 7th, just starting his schedule now should be fine? Or did I truly fuck it up?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9990003705024719}"

If it's mind-altering, I can get addicted to it. There are a ton of drugs out there, some forming habits that are more or less destructive than others.

  I found phenibut when I was in a sober period, and when I say that, I mean just kratom. I had taken nothing but kratom for a couple years. It sounded mellow and pretty safe so I ordered it.

  I loved it. It made music sound great. All my anxiety disappeared. I think the first dose was 1g. I kept taking it only twice a week, for a few weeks. I'm an addict though, so I wanted that feeling all the time.

  So I started taking it every day. Tolerance went up, so I took more. It was 2 gpd, then 3, then 4. I started getting anxiety a couple hours after I would dose, which I was confused about. So I took even more. At the end I was at 8 gpd.

  I was a walking panic attack. I was shoveling phenibut and kratom down my throat but was still unbelievably anxious. I did some research, talked to my doctor, and got some baclofen.

  I literally couldn't take any more phenibut without triggering a panic attack. I figured I was only taking 8 gpd for a couple weeks, so I would take 80mg of baclofen for a few days, then taper quickly. It was not smooth. My moods swung wildly between existential crisis and extreme lethargy. The first 4 days were the worst time I've had coming off of a drug and of course I had to work (at a grocery store). I'm now 6 days out and feeling better, but not 100% yet.

  I've abused and withdrawn from benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, and alcohol. Phenibut takes the cake as the weirdest and worst withdrawal. It has taught me a powerful lesson and I'm not fucking around with my brain anymore. I'm going to stick to kratom for the foreseeable future.

But it's the mental withdrawal symptoms that you have to deal with that become the issue. Now I'm not going to sugar coat it, it is going to suck...but you will pull through it just fine by being strong. First thing you may need to do is take a week off from work, especially if you have to constantly work talking with the public like I do at my job, because you are going to be caught up with horrible thoughts in your head and the last thing that you want to be dealing with are Karens & Kens up in your ear all day for an 8 hour shift of fuck my life! Here is the time table that you should expect of how things should go. Provided that you have some type of medication to deal with the sleeping aspect of it which you will need either one of the two medications that I mentioned above (Gabapentin or Lyrica) and an over the counter night time sleep aid...because going without sleep for 5-7 days straight is only going to take this anguish up ten fold. From about the 2nd day into the withdrawal you are going to start feeling worthless, and that your life has been wasted or is being wasted (but it hasn't...your life's story isn't finished until it's over...so stay strong!...it is the just the phenibut leaving your body) At times during this you are going to feel like a loser and start comparing your life to the lives of others, and feeling like there is no hope on the horizon...but there is hope...because your life is still a work in progress, and that you just need to get over this little hurdle (and it is a little hurdle in the grand scheme of things.)  You may also start thinking back and beating yourself up over every wrong that you may have done to others in your life, and feeling like you are a horrible person...but again, we've all done wrong and horrible things to people over the course of our lives, so you can't beat yourself up over it. This intense hating and feeling sorry for your self part will go on for a few days...the 3rd day into the withdrawal is usually the worst day going off my own experiences and reading of others same experiences. Then from about day 4 things will slowly start to get better, with each passing day better then the previous day. At times you will even start to see glimpses of your old self shining through and find yourself briefly laughing at something on TV or the internet. This whole withdrawal process should only last about 7-8 days.

I quit gabapentin in June or July. (I had been using the two together for about a year or so). I’ve been slowly getting better but there are times - especially after using weed - that things seem to get worse (anxiety/headaches/depression/brain fog). 

Early in my phenibut withdrawal when I’d use kratom, it would make the anxiety worse. I eventually had to quit it altogether. I didn’t try smoking weed until after 5 months had passed. It helps initially, but weed seems to create more negative symptoms the day after I smoke. 

I read that weed inhibits GABA release - would that affect my brain trying to equalize itself? 

I also read opioids can inhibit GABA release as well. Kratom isn’t technically an opioid, but it is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist. 

Of the two, the kratom seems to produce the least amount of negative side effects (usually none, though on occasion some anxiety), while the weed is all over the place. Obviously weed can make you anxious when you smoke but I’m usually fine when I’m high, it’s the next day that I experience all the bad side effects. 

I did CT the phenibut - maybe if I tapered I wouldn’t be experiencing adverse affects from weed. I dunno.

I was taking 16-20 grams per day for about three months. Without any research I managed to rapid taper down to 0 in a month with the help of Xanax.

After that I quit everything. No phenibut, Xanax, kratom, drinking, nothing.

The withdraw was the worst pain of my life. For 3-4 weeks I could barely eat or even function. My entire body hurt and I had this painful fog in my brain that simply wouldn’t go away.

I read somewhere in here that benzos help with withdraw, so I got my hands on some more Xanax but took as little of it as possible, and most of my withdraw vanished overnight.

I’m at week 6 now, clean from benzos for a week, and I finally feel normal.

For anyone out there still waking up in that hell of withdraw thinking it’ll never end and every day feels like a nightmare, I’m here to give you hope. I remember seeing people outside cooking out and kids playing and wondered what it felt like to simply feel like a human being and be able to do those things.

You CAN do this. You WILL feel better. If you can, get some CBD. That helped me a lot too.

Ok, I would cycle phenibut with use of it a couple times a week, sometimes 2 grams or four, sometimes who knows, for a couple months. I know, I was irresponsible. In the midst of all that I'd take commercial stacks like Alpha Brain and Brain Juice and you know, I generally kept all gains from the phenibut. I was taking a lot of these commercial stacks, which is probably also irresponsible. So much l-tyrosine, my skin was even tanning. With that being said, this went on for months, I'd go days without phenibut, even weeks.

Then I suddenly encountered what I know was a significant impact on my endocrine system relative to my natural hormones and in particular HGH/testosterone, where I lost mass amounts a muscle mass that I never had before, everything thing prior to this everything grew, my hair was brittle and falling out came back in luscious locks, I don't even like mentioning this but it did impact my genitals as well, my dick grew and my balls were bigger, way easier to right me off as a phenibut nut, I know, but those as well started to shrink. As much as it is easy to write me as crazy. please don't chalk this up to mental illness, I know, the people around me saw it, the girls I knew saw it, etc.

At this point, I'm thinking fuck it all, I'm several weeks off phenibut, just taking these natural commercial stacks. Then weeks later I'm in withdrawal, suicidal and soulless. In the hell of it all initially, I got back on the natural stacks for a day, and it ended this all. I didn't keep it up. Now, months later, I feel soulless, complete anhedonia, and now surprisingly phenibut is the only thing that helps, so that obviously fucked up by brain.

So who knows that interaction between phenibut and other shit but my brain is shot to shit, feels as if there is dopamine, complete adhedonia, and yup my life is completely ruined.

I have attempted cold turkey before and learned really quick that was not going to work for me and my job, relationship with my wife, etc. I currently take about 3-4g a day every day and have been for a few years. Its a guess because I began with Red Dawn Liquid not knowing what phenibut even was. Surprisingly even after taking it daily for over a year I was able to quit once before with only some sleeplessness and hot flashes, but when I tried this time I got full on crippling anxiety, panic attacks, etc.

I start getting suspicious of these pills I’m taking in and discover this thread. I tried 1 dose a day the past 2 days and I feel like I am dying but if I take any more I have a severe panic attack and dangerously high bp. I went to the dr today and told him exactly what I was taking and what I discovered. He had no clue what I was talking about. Told me to try to taper off while taking my bp meds. Fine and dandy but if I take even a fraction of a dose it’s instant doom and panic attack and deadly bp. What do I do??? I’m a former drug addict and would have never taken this if I knew. I’m so ashamed and angry and I cannot use any narcotic to help me get off of this.",11,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9976856708526611}"

Been taking like 10 grams of phenibut sometimes more and more for like the past two months. It’s just getting to be exhausting.
 I run through 100 grams in about a week. Sometimes like 3 days.

A little background on me I used to be addicted to heroin, benzos, alcohol, Kratom (still) and amazing assortment of drugs without serious wd symptoms. 

Anyways I will be running out in several days and because of my situation, won’t have the money to purchase more and will go without it for a few days. 

This has happened before and I know a lot about gaba analogies and their cross interactions. So with that being said on those days I don’t have it I need to drink from morning till night. I don’t have a dr right now as I’m waiting until the 24th of September to see her. 

I know that I’ll probably need a benzo. I have gone to the emergency room in full blown WD from it before and it looks like I’m having a panic attack (because I am) and they usually give me ativans or xans. But last year I was on suboxone and I’m not sure if when they see that when they look my ass up if they’ll be like no benzos for this dude.

Any tips on how to get through the shakiness and confusion and panic for a few days?

Love you guys all of you guys are champs I hate this drug. It’s just as bad as benzos in my honest opinion. I was on 4mg a day of clonazepam for a few months and the wd was similar to this",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9993211030960083}"

I would go down to 750mg-1g for 6 months and still did my 2 days a week where I'd get a little high. I decreased by 50-100mg a day, sometimes staying on the same dose (Example: 450mg) for 2-3 days before I decreased again. 

Whenever I decreased the dose to 1g when I was tolerant to 1.5g, I'd get severe apathy.

I don't like high doses of phenibut because it makes me feel stupid. I now know that it's ok to feel a little apathetic - Being social isn't all that - I'd rather study and be accept being an introvert - It's better that way. I feel as good as I do now on 0mg than I did on 1g a day.

I kept tapering for a year! I was intuitive enough to know how much I was tolerant to after I took a little more 2x a week, then continued going up and down with the daily doses.

I started with 500mg twice a day but as you all know I'm at about 2g (8 caps) twice a day. Well within the last 5 days I've been getting weird twitching in my hands (it's a struggle to type this as my hands jump all over the key board every 10 seconds).

Heart racing, heavy brain, really jumpy. I pretty much had to drop my plate and bolt off to take a dose, not even thinking about why something like that happened. Since then, I've been feeling like absolute shit and my brain feels fried. I have to dose every few hours or the withdrawals start to feel really bad. My arm and leg also go numb.

So recently I ventured into the world of phenibut, I bought a 60 count bottle of the phenibut HCL 250 mgs. I went through the bottle in probably about a week/ a week and a half, 3 grams-ish a day.

I haven’t taken any Xanax today. The anxiety is still hell. What’s the outlook look like for me since I didn’t take it long at all?

I would love to hear about your success stories quitting Phenibut from a daily habit.

1. Why did you start taking it? - For me it was my diagnosed depression and social anxiety.
2. How many grams and how often did you consume? - I took it daily 2-2-2g and at some point I even reached 9-15g daily. I took it for more than 3 months.
3. How did you taper off? Just recently I got my dose stable at 4.0 grams a day. Of course I am depressive, lethargic and anxious, my self esteem is very low and sometimes I get a bit of panic and very unpleasant psychophysiological issues but now I got baclofen from my doc (50x10mg).
4. How is your life now? Are you clean from the withdrawal symptoms? How did you manage the big depression from withdrawing from phenibut? I am used to depression and anxiety (as I suffer from it since I'm 15yrs) but what kills me now is to see the difference from my perfect and free life on phenibut and my actual old me and life coming back again.

My plan now is like:

3.5g phenibut + 10mg baclofen + 3g magnesium citrate

3.0g phenibut + 10mg baclofen + 3g magnesium citrate

2.5g phenibut + 10mg/10mg baclofen + 3g magnesium citrate

I had tried to quit many times before this to no avail. I would make it through the first few days of withdrawal, and cave in to buying/taking more in order to not feel like a human garbage bag which of course just led to worse withdrawals, higher tolerance, and diminishing effects. 

The first week or so of my final attempt to quit was a living hell. I was exhausted at all times, my anxiety was through the roof, I was depressed, couldn't sleep at all, and of course I had the cravings for Phenibut itself. After that first week of torturous withdrawal things started to look up and I could finally see the light at the end which I think is what gave me enough hope to not jump back into the Phen-cycle and kept me going even though things still werent exactly *good*.

Now, 3 months later, I finally feel what I would consider *good* and cant even imagine why I started using phenibut in the first place. I feel like a normal person, I feel like I can do things without having that thought of ""Hmm, maybe I should take some Phenibut before I do that"" , and most importantly I feel content. So for all of you out there who have tried to quit and failed, or who are thinking of quitting, just know that it WILL be rough, and its gonna suck. But getting off of Phen is something that you absolutely can do and something that will be very good for you in the end.

Stay strong!

I brought him scientific papers about pharmacology of phenibut and cases with baclofen as a substituting aid. Then I don‘t know why he prescribes me Amitriptyline for the evenings and tells me that this will help and meanwhile I should reduce my dose of phenibut.

What do you say to this? I think that‘s not right and I should go to another doc for baclofen...",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9987144470214844}"

How many grams of phenibut would that equal out to? Does anyone know the equivalency between the two? 

I know for baclofen, that every gram of phenibut equals out to 10mg (or5mg) of baclofen",1,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9982882142066956}"

They said it's just like Gabapentin. I had no idea to dose it or anything. Come to find out I've been taking WAY too much. Im at roughly 15 grams a day for the last 2 months and really only have 9 days left to get through CT.  I'm about 28 hours in, but I just feel like my brain is not working properly.

I would usually stay at 1.5-2g every 3 days until I could barelly feel it's effects anymore. So 5 days ago I took \~3.2 grams and I felt amazing. Extreme euphoria and social skills coupled with confidence, just like the first few times I used it. However, the days after that felt like hell. Insomnia, no joy in doing things and a constant feeling of pain in my head, sort of like an MDMA hangover. Yesterday I took about 3 grams and it put me in a good mood, still social and confident but it wasn't like the last time. Now, the constant pain feels a lot stronger and I feel angry all the time.  I feel like it's not worth it but I also don't want to quit phenibut. What should I do?",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9143977165222168}"
2020-09-01 09:45:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/ikkiqa/i_highly_recommend_phenibut_faa_for_tapering/,I highly recommend phenibut F.A.A. for tapering.,"Ive been using hcl for months but I ordered the F.A.A. version this time and I gotta say, I havent felt this good in months. Its much more potent by weight.  People say by 20% but for me it's more like 30-40% stronger dose for dose. It kinda feels baclofen or gabapentin in this sense rather than just phenibut.

Im currently on 1.8 grams of F.A.A. a day and when I used HCL, it was 3-4 grams a day. This 1.8g of F.A.A. gave me the exact same effects of 3 grams of HCL without ANY side effects. I know some like to claim its not, but phenibut is a very subjective drug.

For me, this version has cured my withdrawal to the point of actually feeling normal. There was even a slight euphoria on the come up like when I first stared using again. Not too noticeable but I definitely felt it for a minute.

If youre looking for an easy taper, this be might be jt for you. Doesn't hurt to try. Good luck!",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9740622043609619}"
