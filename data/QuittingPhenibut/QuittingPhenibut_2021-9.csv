My question is, would I be better off doing a very rapid taper off the phenibut on diazepam, or will this just prolong the whole process and would it be better just to cold turkey? Since either way I'm going to be going through withdrawals which the diazepam will help with. Thanks for any response",5,0

Local store started selling those K Tropix capsules this summer. It has phenibut and kratom extract. Among other ingredients. Both capsules combined have about 1250mg. 50 of which being kratom. I would randomly take 2 capsules a day. 1 a day. 3 a day etc. Not every day. Over the last month and a half or so when they ran out I started having panic attacks. Waking up every 2 hours. Cold sweats. I simultaneously dropped my kratom intake as well but had no idea it was the phenibut. I've got dark circles forming around both eyes as well as red eyelids and above my eyelids. Shitting has become much more of a chore. Just had blood work and stool samples and apparently I'm all clear there. 

Anyways, anyone have experience and advice on any of those symptoms? And for tapering?

I haven't used these for more than maybe 2 months semi regularly. I've started only taking one capsule a day or every other day. Or last night when the panic set in right before bed, I opened a capsule and toss and washed a little bit of the powder shit real quick and had a decent night of sleep. 

Any input is appreciated. I original bought this shit for the kratom and thought it was just super dope kratom. Had no idea what I was getting into",1,0

Never had one but it was the worst impending doom feeling I have ever experienced. I have since quit Suboxone but never really thought that the Phenibut could be what's causing it. I decided to jump off a three days ago and holy fucking cow tits Martha Stewart this shit is fucking brutal. I can't really say that I was taking more than 1.5 g a day but God damn man.

If I stay at 3gpd for this next month, and go down 75~ mg per day, will that be okay? Or does that sound too fast?

At some point I was taking 6 grams a day and didn’t feel much of the positive effects anymore. The highest measured dose I’ve taken was 8 grams in a day. There was one day where I probably took at least a few grams higher than that, but I didn’t measure it. 

My last day on phenibut was on July 13th, 2021, 76 days ago. I’ve had a lot of ups and downs, mostly downs within the first month or month and a half, but things seem to be consistently getting better now. 

During the first several weeks, my libido flatlined, and with little improvement over the weeks, I was worried that I had permanently affected it. Tbh that was a big reason I had a hard time quitting before. I liked being horny all the time, I liked the confidence it gave me for sex, and whenever I quit, my sex drive would plummet and I’d obsess over it until I hopped back on phenibut. During my fourth week since quitting, I even got my testosterone tested and saw that my levels were a lot lower than they used to be. Not technically outside the normal range, but less than half of what it used to be. The experience almost made me consider going on synthetic T, which I knew would just make things worse down the line. 

However, during the last couple of weeks, I’ve noticed my sex drive starting to return to normal. On top of that, I’m getting my energy back, I’m feeling more confident socially, and I’m able to sleep regularly again! It’s really starting to feel like I’m finally able to be… me again. I don’t even crave phenibut anymore. 

I hope this helps some of you and let’s you know that you can get better, and you don’t need phenibut to be better or to function. There is a way out of this mess where you can come out alive and better than you were before.",21,0

I have been on phenibut since lockdown started happening, it helped me a lot.

As a lot of ppl on this sub, I’ve started using it daily, never went above 3gdp. I have adhd so I take Ritalin and I have found that if you are on stimulants and you want to get off of phenibut, it is much harder. 

So I stopped using stimulants for 2 and a half weeks and I started tapering from 1.7gdp, -100mg a day. It is absolutely painless, no withdrawals at all.

This day I’m at 400mg*.

My question is, if I would take 1g today, will it somehow mess with my tapering schedule? Or can I “relapse” for one day and then continue with the taper where I left off the previous day?

Thank you.",3,1

I feel so transformed by this ordeal, and I just want you all to know you are so much more powerful than this substance has lead you to believe. If you are anything like me, you used this substance to give you something that you believed wasn’t already there inside yourself.

It’s ok to feel shy, not get everything done all the time, having slow days, not being the most articulate and etc.The you without phenibut isn’t less, it’s so much more than you understand.

Then I had to find something else legal so after researching and trying a couple times I got addicted to my wonder drug Phenibut, ignoring all the calls of how easy it is to abuse & get addicted. During my 3 years I totaled cars, broke numerous bones to not thinking and really just having fun with no real worries. 

After 3 years of up to 20 gpd and more I am finally knew I had to taper down to 6 but after some really weird things happening in my brain. At first I was getting numb spots in my jaw head and the effects of the phenibut were lessening then they would come back and I felt a growing sense of pressure in my head. I opened a fresh order one morning and freaked out when there was no response from my body or mind from my normal dose, thinking I got some fake phenibut or the supply was that weak.  I ended up taking a bunch more that morning and the only effects were falling asleep standing up. During this time I started a slow taper with crazy fluctuating anxiety, numbness, some sleepless nights like I was in complete withdrawal just all around weird. Then the effects came back slowly but not strong so I kept using and stopped tapering down & just stayed at the same level about 14 gpd.

Fast forward another month and in a matter of a week it completely stopped working, and every time I would dose there was huge pressure in my head in what Im assuming is my receptors, as well as pain.  The next morning I decided to taper faster the next morning so I went from 14 gpd to 10 with no more negative effects just the pain & pressure in my head. Still no relief, crazy anxiety always wanting to dose more. I have been taking NAC and fasacetam but the NAC would make my anxiety way higher(thought it would lower it) so I only take it at night when I am home.  

Also I still drink alcohol at night but mostly just to fall asleep, weird thing is I dont get drunk anymore either! It does the trink to get me to sleep but, there is really only a light feeling even if I drink excessively. 

When I take the NAC and the fasoracetam I can also feel the pressure in my head get stronger like its my hitting my receptors.   Im down to 6 gpd in my taper just wondering if anyone has went through any of this? Wondering if I burnt out my receptors and will they come back? Hoping I dont have a brain tumor and scared to go to a doctor and explain all this. I cant act normal in society, Ive been numb for 3 years on phenibut so day to day the anxiety, depression, weird feeling in my head is so tough to deal with.

Im taking 40 mg fasoracetam and 1200 mg NAC daily, any recommendations for anything to help?

There is hope!,"Just wanted to share my experience for those thinking about quitting phenibut or in the midst of tapering/withdrawals.  I was a 5g+/day user for 10+ years.  4 of those years I would dose 3-4g in both the morning and the evening and I found the withdrawals when I ran out to be excruciating and miserable, as discussed widely on this forum.  I never stopped for any sustained time with cold turkey; it was always a supply issue, not intentional, and I would advise highly against it based on my experience.  The last 6 or 7 years I would just dose once per day (5-6g) and early this year decided I had enough.  Benefits were minimal, phenibut has been getting more and more expensive, and I was scared of long term effects.  

I tapered quickly, about 500 mg/day every couple of days until I got to low dose (<500 mg) and then slower, about 7-8 months ago.  The two-three weeks after stopping were pretty miserable; anxious, super irritable, no motivation, bad mood, sleepless nights.  Things got much better and I was enjoying day to day stuff and had a good amount of motivation to do things at work, around the house, etc.  

Things were going so well that a thought came a few months later...maybe try it again but more infrequently and I might be able to get the magic back.  I ordered 100g and was able to use a smaller dose (3-4g) but even if I used it for a single day I would get the lethargy/grumpiness/lack of motivation the next few days.  Using a couple days in a row caused the above plus sleep issues (duh...that's why I should stay away from phenibut because I don't take as recommended).  I'm about a week out from my last dose and not looking back; I'm starting to feel more normal, sleep is better, mood is stabilized.    I don't need or want phenibut in my life and wanted to share that if you don't want it either you can walk away!  Tapering is HUGELY important.  Sounds like my taper might have been quicker than advised, so please take it for what it is and be safe when tapering.  This substance is no joke.",11,0

And it has been life changing for me, making me able to do stuff i couldnt before, because of social anxiety. I lived my years from 15-19 working on my SAD and it got better, but still not to the point where i could be social and speak my mind without worrying constantly. Phenibut HCL did that for me.

I used to dose only 2 times a week, Monday and Wednesday. It helped me gain a lot, new friends, as i could be myself comfortably, and speak my mind comfortably and it also helped me in school as i wasnt scared to raise my hand. Ofcourse it had some cheating effects too, like enhancing my thought process and so on. But for the last 5 months, ive taken phenibut every 2nd day. My dosing has been really high before, but ive tapered down to like 12g every 2nd day. Its still too much i know, but i dont know how to live my life without it anymore. I got a girlfriend too, and a apartment and i know Phen just made it for me, so i could be myself. Not that im something that i wouldnt be normally, just way more free from my severe anxiety. I didnt have anxiety when i was younger, it was something that came when i was 15. Probaly inherited it from my father, and experienced some things over the years that made it worse. I still always had friends though, but it just got worse over the years from 15 to 19.

&#x200B;

I want to find something else, that can help me with my social anxiety. Im thinking of facoracetam or aniracetam. I just cant go back to the way it was before right now, ive got too many things to think about. And it honestly scares me, whats gonna happen if i dont have any medicine perhaps similiar to Phenibut, that can help me with anxiety. Im not looking for anything recreational, but just something that can help me keep anxiety down so i can live my life. The only reason im dosing 12g, is so i can feel it the next day aswell. Otherwise i could do 6g, and feel it the whole day. But the next day would just be bad. I have a pain in my left side under my rib sometimes, and i know its from Phenibut.

But im thinking, i could taper down to like 1-2 g and then somehow, idk how, but make it so that those 6g wouldnt be needed to feel effects, and just 1 or 2 g instead so i know im not damaging my body. Yes i know its because my tolerance is high as shit. I know i need something for my anxiety, i take zoloft too at 50mg but it honestly hasnt helped me even slighty, but i think it does for depression.

Please only reply with something useful or nice. I know my situation is not good, and thats why im seeking help. Im booking a time at the doctor tomorrow, to get a blood test. I havent taken phenibut for 2 days now, and im waiting for my next 125g to arrive on friday. Still though, i want to find some other solution, or just get my tolerance down.

Advice?","Since I was a kid I've always been a bit more down, more in my own head than other kids. Social anxiety became an even bigger problem in middle/high school. I was always anxious, even with my own friends, always second guessing myself. Always the silent one. Then I found phenibut and you know what happened next: life was finally great, is this how people feel? No wonder they are happy.

The first six months: bliss. But then: In the next 2 years, my use consisted of taking 3/4g, sometimes daily, sometimes 3/4/5 times a week. Withdrawals got worse and worse while the phenibut did less and less. I'm talking serious depression. I can't even smoke any weed without having a full-on panic attack if I haven't taken any phenibut.

Now, I'm getting diagnosed for ADD, which would partly explain my earlier anxiety and depression that I've always felt. I also have serious concentration problems. I bought some ritalin and it did exactly what I expected, I was actually motivated but not in a euphoric way. It even greatly reduces my anxiety! Here's where I really fucked up: I combined it with high doses of phenibut and booze, two nights in a row. Shit was awesome in the moment...

This last withdrawal period has been the worst I've ever experienced and it's made me come to terms with the fact that I have to give up the phenibut completely or I'm looking at a life sentence of depression. 

Here's the problem: I'm starting at a new school in a new city in a few days. I don't know how I'm going to handle all those new social situations without phenibut... And then I also have all my other social circles that I need to maintain. Do I taper? Will the ritalin just worsen my withdrawal? I want to be completely done with phenibut so I can explore what a therapeutic and prescribed dose of meds can do for me. I'm not interested in feeling euphoric or being a social god anymore, just want to be normal.

In conclusion, I want out but I'm in such a deep hole and I don't see how I should start healing my dopamine-depleted system. Please someone help me because I don't see a way out anymore.",8,0

I couldn’t go any lower than 2gpd without very disruptive withdrawals. Then I found this sub and one of the wonderful mods here suggested Agmatine. Once I started adding that to my taper, the withdrawal effects were lessened immensely, most of the time being zero! I was able to drop 250mg per week-10 days and today I’ve taken zero!

I lost my job last year due to Covid, and it really ramped up. I finally had to admit I have a problem, told my family, and went and got help at a rehab facility. One of the hardest things to go through.

But withdrawal at a rehab facility was treated, and within about 3-4 days, I was feeling good again. I stayed there another 4 days and got out, feeling great.

I was stupid and started using Phenibut again March of this year. I was a daily phenibut user while drinking, but that was only around 500mg/day, if that. I got off of it in the later times after I lost my job to Covid, and was off it for probably around 5 months.

I started using phenibut again in March to fill the void, to help with confidence, to help me become an amplified version of me. I got a job, I was loving life. Some days I'd dose more when I wanted a better high. But it's not worth that anymore, it's not worth being tied to a drug. I want to feel like I did when I got out of rehab. I need to accept ME. I want to feel FREE again. Right now I'm embarrassed that I'm now latched onto other drugs, especially after all the time and money I spent on rehab. I really don't want to have to tell my family about this.

I am also using Kratom, but that was a more recent discovery, around the May timeframe of this year. It's allowed me to reduce my phenibut intake, but being addicted to 2 drugs isn't good either. I've also considered DXM as a different high. Tried it, but didn't like it very much tbh.

The plan is to taper off completely from both of these drugs. The temporary high isn't worth it, especially when you keep needing more to feel it.

Since my daily usage is erratic (could be 3g, could be 4g, could be 1.5g), right now, the plan is to set a baseline of 2g of Phenibut at night time, and I notice the weird anxious and ""nervy"" feeling subside a lot. The pins and needles just kind of fade away. I also dose about 5g-10g of Kratom alongside it, which also helps with the withdrawal type of feelings. I am able to sleep OK, but not great, I'm using zzzQuil to help put me to sleep. I have Agmatine Sulfate and am starting to dose that with the Phenibut. I ordered NAC and GABA as well, as I've heard those are supposed to help. I have L-Theanine gummies, Ashwagandah gummies, and I plan on picking up Magnesium tablets, all in hopes those will help with the WD's.

This taper and quitting is non-negotiable in my mind. I know it's not going to be easy. I know I'm not going to feel good. But it's what has to be done.

I've read a few taper guides, but I'm still not sure how fast I should go with this. It also scares me how low of a dose people get down to, yet still feel withdrawals after totally kicking it. 250mg a day and still withdrawals? Crazy. Should I be shooting for an eventual 100mg/day, and then reducing that by 10mg/day? Seems like the jump should be easy once you've hit 100mg/day.

Any tips for a solid taper plan? Do you recommend dosing throughout the day to keep the WD's at bay, and then day by day, reduce the dosing at certain times of day. Or should I do what I'm doing now, and dose at night, every night, reducing the dosage by about 10% at certain increments? My goal is to not end up with a seizure, or end up in the ER, or rehab.

My fingers are having trouble doing what I tell them to like they are shaky.  It's hard to stay awake for more than a few hours at a time, but it's also hard to sleep.  Do I need to go to the ER and tell them what's happening, have them call poison control, and get some baclofen?  Basically am I gonna die here?  Cause I really feel like it.  Please help.

Is it's only a few more days or weeks of this I think I can probably suffer through it, but idk what to do or what to expect and I'm scared.

Edit: +t40h It's now been 40 hours since my last dose and I feel constant crushing anxiety.  I'm not suicidal and I have a few IRL friends who have been coming over to support me.  I just really want the anxiety to stop.  Last night I couldn't sleep at all, just turning over every fifteen minutes for eight hours.  Tonight I'll try diphenydramine to help with sleep.  I can absolutely get through another day, but man this is tough.

Edit2: +t48h It's been about 48 hours since my last dose and most of the constant pressing anxiety is gone.  I can walk around and function mostly normally.  I don't feel good, but I don't feel like I'm going to die anymore.  Sleep is another issue.  I just want to sleep, but when I lay down the anxiety peaks and I can't calm down enough to sleep.  I really hope trazadone/diphenhydramine can help me relax enough to sleep soon.

Edit3: +t50h and the anxiety and my inability to sleep means I'm going into the hospital.  I have a case study printed out and will be asking for baclofen.

Edit4: +t55h went to the ER and goddamn there was a line out the door and I decided to try another day before going in.  Someone below mentioned using kratom for a few days to actually sleep and help with that part.  I rarely use it, but I have some so I'll try it.  I took some trazadone at +t52h to try and calm me down.  I think this hit while I was there and ended a panic attack.

Edit5: +t60h went back to the ER because my anxiety was peaking.  Again I was able to calm myself down after being there for an hour.  There was a four hour wait so I left.  Now I'm figuring out that these are panic attacks and if I can work through it I'll be okay.

Edit6: +t65h was able to sleep intermittently for about three hours total.  This is what I really needed.  I can tell I'm still anxious, but haven't had those constant panic attacks.  Once I realize I'm having one I kinda throw on a meditation and calm myself down after twenty minutes.  If you can't tell yet, this is hell.

Edit7: +t78h was able to sleep a solid hour with 200mg traz and 50mg diphenhydramine.  I'm not hitting REM at that length, but it's helping to keep me sane.  There's still constant anxiety, but no new panic attacks really to speak of.

Edit8: +t90h went back to ER because my anxiety was peaking and out of desparation for sleep.  They weren't willing to give me any perscription for anything and implied my inability to sleep was because I was anxious.  They called poison control and were explained about Phenibut.  They came back and said it's going to take 5-7 days before I'm able to sleep, but that they still wouldn't prescribe me anything.  They offered a consult for a mental health physician on staff, I declined and went home.

Edit9: +t92h managed to sleep for two hours straight.  No drugs, just sleep.

Edit10: +t98h I feel like I'm having a moment of clarity that I shouldn't be alone right now.  I'm trying to call a few friends to come watch me for the next few days to make sure I don't do something stupid out of sleep deprivation.  If that fails I think I'll have to go back to the hospital and ask them to admit me for monitoring.  Not sure what to do here.  I alternate between thinking I'll be fine and a panic attack that says I'm gonna die.  When I calm down I think I'll be okay in a few days, but when I'm in that panic mode I'm terrified.  Thoughts?

Edit11: +102h I'm back to feeling a bit better.  I think it's because I didn't spend all day trying to sleep and instead tried to distract myself.  I'll try and get an hour or two later tonight instead of trying all day long.  We'll see.  This shit sucks.

Edit12: +105h woke up after a 30 min nap and had a panic attack.  Fun.

Edit13: +111h woke up from five hours of fragmented and restless sleep.  I've got some substantial brain fog.  My anxiety is still present.  I'm exhausted.  But now that I can sleep I'll be okay.  I'll keep updating cause someone will read this when they're quitting and want to know.  If I had enough energy to happy cry for being able to sleep then I would.

Edit14: +119h woke up from eight hours of sleep.  Some of it was restless, some of it was solid.  Brain fog, anxiety persists.  My HR has dropped down significantly.  When I went into the ER it was up to 180 and over the last 10 hours it's been down to 130 or 140.  I haven't had a panic attack in 15 hours.  I've got plenty of smaller issues, but they don't seem to matter compared to sleeping.  Peripheral neuropathy, excessive feet sweating, lethargy, etc.  We'll just keep going forward.

Edit15: +164h Anxiety is still pretty bad.  Panic attacks are still fairly regular.  Feet sweating has decreased slightly.  My sleep is pretty shit.  I'll be in bed for 8 hours but toss and turn the whole time, maybe only sleeping restlessly for a few hours total.  Brain fog has been bad over the last few days, hopefully this all improves.

Edit16: +170h Brain fog is letting up a bit, tired of non-solid stools, hopefully my sleep improves soon.  Otherwise I'm feeling okay.

Edit +194h No brain fog today, slept a full eight hours and was only restless toward the end, feet seating less.  Not only have I not had a panic attack today, but I have had almost no anxiety.  I'm feeling good.",7,0

I havent had any in about 36 hours at this point and I only slept maybe one or two hours last night.

I have unfortunately did this once before, about the same dose and time period and I had 3 sleepless nights and then things started to return to normal.

I looked in the bottle and I have probably \~500mg left, do you think that taking it at around the 44 hour mark(a few hours before bed)  would be helpful for sleep or do you think it would just extend the withdrawal.

Also do you think benadryl would help with sleep at all or possibly just potentiate my chances of delirium?",1,0

I have been using pheni for 2-2.5 yrs. my starting dose was .5-.8mg daily. Around 1.5-2yrs in, I worked myself up to around 3-3.3gpd. I have gone down to around 2.2-2.4gpd within the past month or so. I Just ordered NAC and Agmatine due to all the praise I’ve found on this subreddit. 

How do I go about using these two products to help me taper from this god awful substance? Ive read a lot about these two things, but I don’t quite understand how to effectively use these tools to quit phenibut. I dose pheni one time a day 1-2 hours before work.

I work from 12pm to 9pm 5 days a week and I came home like I always do but I was kind of tired so I laid down around 10:30 and feel asleep around 11pm. I woke up at 1:30am and had a overwhelming feeling of depersonalization (don't know if i spelt is correctly, sorry 😐). I cant even beging to explain what I felt but it was nothing like I ever experienced before. It was like fear, anxiety and a weird body sensation, it was nothing I ever felt before and I just kept pacing back and forth not knowing what to do or what was happening to me. I rememberd I had made the jump the night before from 900mg to 600mg so I went and took 900mg and a hour later I felt normal again so it was definitely the Phenibut. 

What's weird is that I've been doing this tapering successfully for months and just now is when I started getting these feelings. Again its was unlike anything I ever felt, so strange, so scary, so overwhelming.

I had used phen for about 3 weeks to help with Kratom WD. Between 500mg and 1250mg nearly everyday. I was terrified I had gotten myself into something worse. I decided to do a rapid taper just in case. I started 500mg every other day for 4 days but couldn't tell if it was K WD or phen. 

Welp, it looks like it was just the K. I dropped down to 250mg phen for a day, then halved that for a day then stopped all together 2 days ago. No noticeable WD for the entire taper or after jumping. 

Thanks for this community, your engagement and for thoroughly scaring the shit out of me! 

Good luck to all!

I won't be back!

I was being really stupid and mixing it with high doses of my ADHD medication, Vyvanse. At the end of May I was forced to rapidly taper off the Phenibut and cold turkey the Vyvanse. The last time I had any Phenibut was on May 27th.

It has been 104 days now since I have taken any Phenibut and I have felt fucked up since then. Anxious, depressed, dissociated. To make matters worse I have not been able to take my ADHD meds since my doctor while no longer prescribe them to me. Even when I did try taking some minor doses of Adderall I was just sent into a panic. It could be because I abused Adderall a lot in the past or maybe the Phenibut did something to my brain.

I am on Klonopin now and am tapering off of that. I still feel like shit, have felt this entire time. I am really hoping that what I am feeling right now is just the Klonopin but it is hard to say. I obsess all day that the Phenibut permanently damaged my brain somehow and now I am just fucked.

There were ups and downs during this period and I was feeling a little better before my doctor cut my daily Klonopin from 1mg to 0.750mg. I am really hoping the Klonopin is causing all of this. I have been feeling some physical symptoms that I did not feel when coming off the Phenibut, so I am really hoping it is just the benzo. If I get off the Klonopin and am still this fucked up months down the road I don't know what I will do. Gabapentin did not work and coming off that just made me feel worse.

Regardless, using Phenibut is the greatest regret of my entire life. I feel like I will never recover from this. Again, I was using a lot of amphetamines, Phenibut and now I am coming off of months of using Klonopin, so it is no wonder I feel like shit, but I keep thinking back to the Phenibut because that is where all this BS began and I have not felt normal since then.",1,0

So this is the first day I took Fasoracetam to upregulate my Gaba B receptors as others have claimed that it would.

I took 20mg in the morning with some breakfast (eggs, tea and toast).

Nothing happened until the 3 hour mark. At 3 hours I started getting a little anxious and paranoid about nothing whatsoever. It felt like phenibut withdrawal kicked in twice as hard. It also felt a little euphoric at the same time so it was a weird feeling.

An hour after that, it started to feel like the tail end of an LSD trip where I start feeling happier about life in general and also everything was crystal clear to me. I started to remember old songs and memories. Everything in my memory was so vivid. 

I tend to skip videos and songs a lot because I get bored real quick but with Faso I listened to the entire song, watched an entire video without being bored. I started speaking very fluently and with clarity. 

After a couple hours the anxiety turned into anxiolysis and I started to feel amazing like an afterglow of a psychedelic. It was fantastic. It still feels like that now tbh. 

Very unusual substance but it’s amazing in my eyes. Great to recover from but it is a little anxiogenic. It’s good after your taper not during.",2,0

My situation is a bit convoluted. I CT kratom 10 days ago. I used phen to help with the quit, bad idea, I know now. The crux of my situation is I have used phen before and never noticed any sort of withdrawal or come down, albeit not daily use. 

About 5 days in to my K CT, I got super paranoid that I had created a worse issue with phen but I could not tell if it was just K withdrawal. 

I decided to do a quick taper of phen to be safe. Started at 500mg every 2 days. 2 days ago I dropped to 250mgs and then 112mg last night.

I have had no withdrawal that I can feel other than some sleep issues, though that could still be lingering k issues. 

Tonight I am jumping from the phen to see how it goes.

It's been a very long haul, but I was going pretty slow.  I figured (for me) instead of a daily dose in the morning - I split the dose in half, morning and night.  
Splitting the dose has let me trim off some as I go without feeling it much.  
I was doing .5g in morning, then .5 at night.

Now, .45 day, .45 night.  
tonight it will be .40.  I plan to drop at least 50mg every couple days at minimum.

today i'm getting pretty dizzy and having a hard time focusing, but overall I am feeling better.

Need some help here. I didn’t realize how dependent on Phenibut I was. Decided I’d like to stop taking it and was hit with withdrawals last night. 

As referenced in the title I’ve been taking 1 gram every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday for about 6 months now. I’ve never had any withdrawal symptoms between doses so I assumed I was not dependent. I know, big mistake.

Last dose was Saturday morning at 11 am. I didn’t begin to feel withdrawal symptoms until last night (Tues evening). I hardly slept due to the anxiety and restless feeling I have in my arms and legs. In addition I feel pretty disassociated in general. I need to work and part of me wants to push through as I’m on day 4 since my last dose. I picked up som Ashwagandha, L Theanine and Magnesium Glycinate this morning but it doesn’t seem to be helping. I have and old Xanax script that I can take at night but trying to keep that to no more than once a day at .5 mg. 

Couple of questions. First I read that acute symptoms usually last 7-12 days for most. I know everyone is different. Is the 7-12 days supposed to be from last dose or from onset of WD symptoms? Second if I were to taper what would be the best way to do so seeing as I’ve only been taking it 3 days a week at 1 gram on the days I take it. Should I just push through with the CT?

Sadly I have just relapsed for the 7th time (on a combo of benzos, kratom, phenibut, and the occasional coke binge). It is fair to say that I am reaching my breaking point with addiction. I simply do not know how to break the loop. It is my 7th time so I feel like I'm getting closer and closer, and simply learning what my triggers are, but yet here I am.

Personally I'm not much of a texter, or a caller really. I like to talk to people face to face. 

I've been to NA multiple times, with no success. It seemed to just be a bunch of people reding verses from some book that sounded like the Bible. Before I insult anyone, I'm sure this book has saved countless lives, but personally no matter how much I tried I could not get it to help me. Frankly I wanted to to talk about why people took the substance in the first place? Why people felt inclined to keep taking it? What people's triggers were and what they did to control them? And if they were completely clean from the stuff, what was there final solution to kick It for good?

I have an incredible group of friends and family who have relentlessly supported me through my multiple relapses, but I would like to speak in person with someone who actually has or has had a serious drug addiction.



I live I Cambridge, UK, 26, male. 

The way I pictured it was we would all meet midday at a coffee shop in a relatively crowded location. This way everyone would feel safe.

I am seeing my doctor on Thursday the 9th to talk about my phenibut usage. I have been using for approximately 2-2.5 years. My dosage is 2.3 gpd. I started off with this energy shot called “sleepwalker”. I didn’t know what was in this stuff but man was I hooked on that shit. I would go to the head shop every single day and spend 5 dollars on this shit. One thing led to another and I found out it’s main ingredient was phenibut. Long story short, I started at probably 100mg a day, to my current 2.3gpd. I really want to kick this shit before I end up killing my self so I’ve scheduled an appointment with my doc. 

I am printing out this here to show my doc:

From what I’ve read on this subreddit, this is one thing that will show I am serious about quitting. But I want some more input on what I should do when I see him. Thank you guys so much for everything, this subreddit is the only reason I don’t feel alone and have confidence in my ability to quit.

I thought it was the antibiotics they prescribed me but it was phenibut withdrawals! I scheduled an appointment with my doctor for this Thursday. What exactly should I bring to him to show him I am serious about quitting? I don’t want to be sent into treatment, I have too many responsibilities to take care of. I’ve printed the page everyone has linked to print out, but what else should I have prepared when I see my doctor? Thank you guys so much for this sub-Reddit! It gives me hope.

I just wanted to share a particular regimen that I am on that is helping me immensely and might help some people out there without much information.,"I was taking around 2 g per day of phenibut FAA for around 9 months. I am now at 900 mg, and before I share my stack with you that is helping me very much, I was just dealing with the constant glutamate surges which totally sucked. But I have found a stack that has been helping me almost to the point where I feel like I don't need to use this poison anymore.

My stack consists of NAC, lemon balm, l theanine and agmatine. And let me tell you, it is working wonders for me. I only dose phenibut one time in the morning and that is it. So when night time rolls around I take all these supplements, and I cannot believe how much it is helping me with my glutamate surges along with tachycardia. I researched extensively to try and find out what helps with not only glutamate surges, but what helps to heal your gaba system naturally and this is what I came up with. I feel like I can jump off right now and just keep on taking these supplements, but I am scared of having a seizure.

My question to you my friends is this, if I jump off right now am I in danger of having seizures?",8,0

Decided to taper down, really fast in the beginning, like 250mg a day, which worked suprisingly well. Then around 3g slowed down, reducing between 5mg-200mg a day, depending on how I felt in the morning. I promised myself to reduce my dose every single day, even if it was just a tiny amount. Today, after 50 days of tapering I finally reached 300mg for my morning dose.

I slept fine most nights, when I started feeling the anxiety or the psychotic thought patterns coming on I supplemented with L-Theanine, Ashwhaghanda, Lemon Balm and/or Valerian Root, which worked fine most of the time or at least made it manageable. Withdrawal symptoms mostly consisted of bouts of boredom, depression, lethargy, brain fog and the inability to concentrate. Also these weird vision problems, when I look at a blank wall it's kind of flickering, like a static hanging over it. 

Now the last two weeks I've been feeling more off than before, should I just jump? I don't know if I'm making it worse by really slowly tapering now from 300mg, I've been reducing like 20mg a day or less and I'm getting impatient. Also by coincidence got my hands on a pack of 14x75mg Lyrica tablets, should I try to just drop the phenibut and if the withdrawal gets really bad just take a single Lyrica as needed? I just want this to be over, but I also need to be able to work, man this is getting really frustrating",3,0

Years ago when i first got phenibut HCL, (first time trying phenibut).
But years later, now, I’ve been taking FAA everyday for a couple years. I’ve always parachuted it, toilet paper, separate the ply’s, split it into fourths, and put two scoops in each, roll into ball, and swallow. But in my mind, i considered each ball, 1g. 
But its not.
2 scoops of FAA is 500mg.
2 scoops of HCL is 1g.

I’ve been taking FAA for ages, so i thought my daily dose was 12g.
Liftmode ran out of FAA, so i ordered what i could, and got HCL.
The next week or two i was taking the same dose. 12g.
Except guess what fuckers!
Turns out the dose I’ve been taking for the last however many months, was actually only 6g,
And then out of nowhere, i immediately doubled my dose and was taking 12g.

That is INSANELY dangerous. Please make sure you know exactly how much you’re taking.

What baffles me tho, is there was literally no difference. Felt exactly the same. The only thing that changed, was i had some really shitty stomach issues, but i just assumed it was just cause its acidic, and harder on the tum.

Good news is, my daily does is way lower than i thought. That change in perception really made me happy haha",5,0

I used it when I was kicking phenibut a few months ago and it was a godsend; I still use it from time to time when I notice my mood and energy getting low but I figured I'd pass on the good news as I know phen is a motherfucker to kick and every little bit helps. Here is a pubmed article about it: 

&#x200B;

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381625/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381625/)

&#x200B;

The article doesn't focus on attenuation of drug withdrawal but mentions how it is used for withdrawal as well as pain and anxiety. It seems entirely possible that the current does interfere with signaling in the prefrontal cortex, specifically in the medial regions that are over-active when people are in the state of over-rumination characteristic of anxious and depressed moods. I notice that when I use it (I have it on right now) my pain diminishes, i'm able to sit still more easily, and I'm able to focus better. It gives me that disconnect from ego, rumination, and over-focus on bodily sensations that is typical for me when i'm in low moods, whether they are substance related or not.

I should have known better but anyways it started making me feel like shit out if nowhere. I feel like I'm detoxing from opiates (2.5 years clean from opiates) pretty bad constant anxiety. Crazy bad mental fog. It's affecting me a work in the worst way. I've tried a higher dose one day, a lower dose another, nothing works. But really have never wavered from the 6g a day.

      I told my psych doctor and she put me on gabapentin 300mg 3xs a day in order to taper down. Well I made the switch seamlessly. I started feeling better a few days later and never looked back to the sickness. 

 Now with my next visit she wouldnt refill. She said I was supposed to taper. So she gave me Keppra to stop seizures and that's it. From what I've read keppra is not going to mitigate or even lower withdraws. 

So my big question is if I ask her for baclofen at 60mg a day (I believe that's the correct ratio). Would I still notice withdraws at first or would that be a seamless transition like the gabapentin was?. I am very curious as to how that's going to go.

started phenibut on weekends in 2017. Then started taking 500mg daily in mid 2018 because of a somewhat stressful job. 

Pretty much been taking it daily since then. Most of the time it was just 500mg and then more on weekends, but I had periods where I was at 4-7 GPD for a month or two straight. 

In March I went back to 500mg per day

beginning of July I went down to 400 then 300, then 200.. etc. 

5th day of no phenibut today, and I honestly didn’t think I would feel much withdrawal after a taper like that, but I still feel very strange and fatigued. Sleeping most of the night, but only about 5 hours straight then I toss and turn.

Can’t imagine how some of you guys have done cold turkey from such high doses. 

Hoping these symptoms go away within another week or so. 

I workout and use the sauna pretty much everyday and I think that’s keeping me “sane” lol. Especially the stress/anxiety relief after the sauna. HIGHLY recommend the sauna for anyone in a bad place with this stuff!

Also using kava some days to help.
