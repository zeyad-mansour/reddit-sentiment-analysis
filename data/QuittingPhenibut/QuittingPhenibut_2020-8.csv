Over the course of a month I managed to taper that down to 0. But today, my 15th day 100% sober from all substances, I still feel trapped in this hell and I don’t know what to do.

I’m taking magnesium every day and melatonin every night. Every day I try to make a smoothie with a scoop of whey protein powder because of the amino acids in it. But regardless of what I do, these symptoms simply won’t seem to let go.

Some of the more major ones like panic attacks and hallucinations are gone for the most part, but I still feel this painful fog in my brain. My body is also still sore all over. And every little movement feels like a great journey.

I’ve already tried to seek professional help, but I haven’t been able to find a detox/rehab that’s willing to take me because they’ve never even heard of this.

Anyways. How much longer do I have to endure this hell? Is there any way to speed up the healing process? I have a life waiting for me and I’m sick of feeling this way.",6,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8988195}"

Is .050-.020 a good jumping off dose?

Anyone here who has already jumped off in the past what did you experience? Is the first day completely off different that what you normally experience tapering the same amount to a smaller dose?

For many, this meant the loss of a great deal of money, but my main crippling concern was this: I just lost my supply of baclofen.

For months now, I've been getting dirt cheap next-day delivery on baclofen (I'm in the UK) to assist me in getting off phenibut. In that sweet setup, it never occurred to me to bulk order; I now have about a week's supply left and am ass out. I've been taking 50mg+ daily for a long time now, clearly dependent.

That being the case - does anyone have experience with a baclofen cold turkey? Could that be dangerous/unbearable? If so, with nothing else to substitute for it, will I be forced to increase my daily phenibut dose again?

My current plan for when my baclofen supply runs out is just to gauge how I feel, then just increase my phenibut dose 0.5g at a time if I get severe anxiety/heart palpitations. Rather an annoying and unexpected problem to have to solve right now, but so be it. Other suggestions welcome.

I'm addicted to phenibut, psychologically and physiologically. I don't even know how much I take per day, I just scoop phenibut HCL in me until I feel good again. It might be 10-20g a day.

I started using it for my social anxiety and depression and it worked wonders. Now I don't get the euphoria anymore but still the anxiolytic and antidepressant effect. I also got prescribed moclobemide (Aurorix) 600mg daily. This doesn't have much effect on me expect for better sexual function (getting boners and sex drive again), much better than without medication or on SSRI antidepressants.

I also don't eat or sleep much anymore because of phenibut. I also don't get stimulated by anything anymore expect for sports and sex. I have a big sex drive and big and long holdings erections. My depression started coming back again slightly expect I hit the perfect phenibut dose that makes my day but I still have to redose like every 5 hours.

Anybody having same experiences here? Now I want to go to a doc tomorrow to get out of this addiction, I heard about benzos, baclofen and pregabalin. Might a doc give me that? Last time after my addiction I had benzos and they helped great and I could live the sober life again but then I relapsed and here I am now... again. What should I tell the doctor? I might bring a screenshot of the pharmacology of phenibut to make them understand. Any tips for good articles about pharmacology or further information e.g. about withdrawal effects of phenibut? Might any of the above mentioned subtances interact with my moclobemide?

At the time I was on 6.5 grams per day for the last 3-4 months beforehand and at around 4-5 for 3 months before that. It’s been a ride but I’m happy to finally not be dependent on it anymore. I have a few questions regarding what I should expect jumping off/what will happen after I jump off.

1. I’m currently at .340 as of today and I’ve been cutting about 70mg a day since 1 gram taking a day or two break every now and then to level out. I’m wondering what’s a good dose to jump off at? I was thinking .050 but I’m not sure. I feel like .100-.050 is somehow a lot less difficult than .050-.000 as it’ll be the first time in months I haven’t dosed at all. Should I expect minor withdrawals after stopping?

2. As far as PAWS go I have no idea what I’m in for. Generally, once I tapered past 1.5 my depression started to get better but my anxiety and inability to concentrate has gotten a little worse but not too bad. I definitely feel like I have some mental fog too but it’s been so long since I’ve Started tapering I don’t remember what it’s like to not have that lmao. I’m wondering how long I should expect to start feeling my normal self again and regaining my ability to concentrate and having a more consistent mood in general. My passion in life is making music but this taper has caused me to have such a hard time feeling deep emotional connections to art and getting into it at all. I’m sure anyone who creates art experienced no drive to do it anymore after starting tapering off of phenibut.

3. Sex drive, when tf does that come back. It sure would be nice to give a shit about getting laid again lol.

4. Does anyone have any good suggestions on what supplements would be good for helping my body regulate GABA-B levels again or just provide my brain with the chemicals it needs recover quicker/better?

A question for those of you who have tapered successfully. A bit of background first. I began using phenibut a few times a month back in April, and with kratom it was like switching on god mode. Long story short, it soon became daily use, never more than 3g per day. I’ve tapered down to about 300-330mg per day mostly painlessly. Though I should add, I’ve been pretty depressed and feeling shitty for a while now, mostly due to a multiple year kratom addiction, so that might’ve masked any discomfort dropping the P.

Where I’m at now. Quit kratom with the aid of subutex, and about to begin tapering down. Have only been on a month. I know this is frowned upon, but I used subutex years ago to kick a dope habit and the taper was a walk in the park. I’m seeing the same doc, and he’s very knowledgeable when it comes to tapering. I’m also tapering of Xanax and plan to be done with that by sept 8 or so.

My question is this, for anyone with a similar experience. Am I at a low enough phenibut dose to jump off? Should I wait until I’m successfully off the subutex and Xanax while continuing to lower my phenibut dose, or jump now?

I ended up losing control and couldnt even keep myself stable on it for work or just everyday life. I was also an opana/suboxone user(1 strip per day when not on opana). I figured I'd share my experiences.

I ended up going to a rehabilitation center and they put me on the full librium and suboxone taper. I took my last dose of 1.5 in the morning around 10 AM and entered the facility at 9PM. I know I didnt have the horrid experience alot of people had but here it is:

I wasnt able to sleep, not a wink, for the first 7 days in the rehab. I was very very anxious the whole time, and the librium is the only reason I did not have a constant panic attack. I still went through them every day, with only one absolutely horrid one, for about 8 days. They ended up giving me seroquel to sleep on the 7th day and I fell asleep, but had horrible nightmares or lucid dreams where I would be ripped in and out of sleep, waking up sweating every time, for the first 12ish days. The half asleep hallucinations were probably the scariest part...when I knew I was trying to wake up but I was caught in between and couldn't pull myself out.

 After that I started to feel pretty normal and took 50mg of vistaril 4 times a day and for some reason that seemed to keep the anxiety and nervousness away for the most part. I started on those damn sleepwalker pills and ended up on nootropics as I see some people have gone through. I had abused and been addicted to a few drugs in my time...but phenibut scared the living shit out of me and I needed professional help. 

The rehab had not heard of the drug which made it a little scary until the doctors researched it and did the librium catapres neurontin tapers. No phenobarbital was used and I did not have a seizure.

This was a lesson that I needed to learn. But, after 2 weeks I'd say I was back to normal. I am very happy to be past it and I'll never touch that shit again. The positives are not worth it at all in my opinion. The only thing I still have are nightmares every now and again but I believe the seroquel has something to do with that so I have lowered my dose.

Also was on Librium for 5 years at 125 mg.Went off cold turkey.

Trying hemp oil for anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome which helps somewhat. I may need something stronger like these other drugs to get me back to the state I was in with Librium and percocet.

So i know this is unorthodox to say the least but let me give you a a little background.

Been using phenibut hcl dayly for more than a year, sometimes up to 5/6g a day. 
I can skip a day but that's it, second night is insomnia, drenched in smelly sweat, anedonia, road rage, and a depression that makes me want to end it right there..

I started using phenibut because my gf of 8years cheated on me and I needed something to cheer me up and stop the intrusive thoughts. 
It worked like a charm till it didn't

Few days ago I got my hand on a popular stimulant used for adhd, made me very productive,  happy and in a very good mood. 

In these four days I totally forgot to dose my dayly phenibut, I would dose the stimulant daytime, and quetiapine to sleep. But I ran out and got back to my phenibut, still not at my normal dose, half was enough, so it was still worty-

2020-08-20 15:27:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/idh0dp/how_does_this_taper_schedule_look_like/,how does this taper schedule look like?,"I got on phenibut after quiting a 900mg lyrica addiction, and was mostly fine except i couldnt sleep nearly at all for 2 months. In desperation i got some phenibut. In retrospect i should have gotten some seroquel and used it to sleep till i got past that stage. Unlike lyrica, i never really got a high or enjoyable effect from phenibut, though the music enhancement is nice (i work as a TV composer). My only fear is that the withdrawal will make me less musical.

For a while i was at 5.5 grams a day, tapered a bit and then stopped and got stuck at 4g for the past few years. Lately i decided to get serious about getting off it (i feel like it is a real ambition killer, lyrica had a similar effect though even worse). Its hard on my kidneys and body too, and i never even really enjoyed it. 

Not long ago i accidentally took 8g of phenibut instead of 4g as i had forgot i had already taken the 4g, and the next day i was so fucking tired, nauseated and irritable. I sort of blamed it on my girlfriend since the poor girl is tasked with helping me remember to take it, and i hated her with a phenibut induced passion for not remembering if i had already dose the 4g. I realized, if 8g made me feel that shitty, does my nightly 4g make me feel even half that shitty on a daily basis?

So i made this sheet and im following it. I did it in an excel sheet and printed it and put it on my bathroom mirror. The dose decrease is exactly 1% a day. Ill see how that goes. While it seems like a small reduction, it is 1% compounding, which reduces the dose pretty fast. According to the excell sheet ill be on a few hundred mg by years end.

Ive gotten off a 380mg methadone habit years ago by going slow and steady, a gram a day of diazepam a day addiction (which left me insane for 18 months), a second round of RC benzos addiction that i quite so this should be a piece of cake? Problem is, the older i get the more the withdrawal symptoms are unbearable, and my gaba system is fucked.

Im also averaging 7 bud lights a night, so i need to work on that. Bud light is gross but i switched to taper off since they are low alcohol. If they had beer here that was 3% alcohol id get that instead. Ive quit alcohol before and i think the easiest way is to just stop. I never had serious withdrawal from cold turkey alcohol but ive never been more than a 10 drink a night person. On, years ago, while high on meth, i decided to stop drinking (i was averaging 10 shots of gin a night, but all drank in one big drink over 20 minutes). Crazy thing is that i actually went through with it, and didn't drink another drop for 2 years. So alcohol is easy to quite compared to benzos/phenibut/opioids.

Here is my phenibut taper schedule:

[img]https://i.ibb.co/pP6dDdc/20200820-120336.jpg[/img][/url]

Any thoughts on my logic? In dosing only at night. Is that sound?

Only problem is occasionally ill take a benzo, like once every 2 weeks, and having been through two insane bzd withdrawals, even one dose causes rebound anxiety and insomnia (which hits worse at day 5 usually). Ill have to limit that to improve my success.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.82418585}"

Sorry for my story sucking I'm just a bit panicked, so a couple weeks ago I was incredibly sick from withdrawing from alcohol which I went to the hospital and detoxed from.. looking back now maybe i was also sick from phenibut as well.. anyways once i was detoxed I used the phenibut maybe once to twice a week until 2 weeks ago where I did it 4 days in a week at doses of probably 7g a time.. on monday night i didnt feel it so I took a bunch.. must have been about 18g in total at most honestly... or it could have been less I don't really remember... I'm scared to know the exact number, I ended up just feeling the negative effects and no magic by the end of the night. then like a genius I tried it again wensday morning at like 1am while playing halo, just a normal 6ish g dose or so , so. after that I quit realizing how reckless and dumb I had gotten that week, so my last dose was on wensday at 1 am. strangly enough it is wensday 1 am again while I type this lol, so its been about a week ,  So I am lucky because I didn't hallucinate or hear anything but I was extremely panicked after day 3 just in fear of how bad it could become.. I also used kratom which I have a huge tolerance too, literally i dont even feel kratom now , kava , theanine , and doctor prescribed propranolol to help with the insane anxiety , I basically feel disconnected as if I'm barely here , terrible anxiety in waves , i've been able to sleep very poorly albeit but have managed too yesterday with Benadryl and melatonin. weird thing is i can get tired but I've been so itchy i can't sleep.. I have zero libido.. My big question is I'm wondering if I should continue the complete cold turkey or maybe take a dose as small as 1g??

The first time I was on about 7 grams a day for a year and a half. My withdrawals were not too bad as far as the way I felt but I ended up having a seizure and cracking my head open on day 7. Quit for a while and relapsed and was posting on here when I was using 5-7 grams every third day. It wasn’t daily use but when I quit I had a much harder time than the first withdrawals, no seizure though. Both of these times I had either lyrica or gabapentin to get me though and it was awful but I managed. I went to rehab, got sober and got off Kratom, gabapentin and everything. 2.5 months ago I relapsed and it didn’t take long for it to get terrible. I’m back on Kratom and taking more than I ever have. I’m back on phenibut for the whole 2.5 months. Started off using only 2 grams every third day. I have now worked my way up to 10 grams, the highest dose I’ve ever been on and worked my way up to using every other day. I know it’s not daily use but I can’t help but think I’m absolutely fucked. Since I got off my gabapentin and lyrica I have no helper meds. I’m in a sober living where I’m supposed to be sober at but obviously I’m not.. because of this I can’t take any benzos to help and I wouldn’t really want to anyway. I’m trying to figure out a way to get gabapentin or baclofen. Nervous of ordering online because last time my package from all day chemist never arrived and I know it’s probably going to take 2 months or so because of the pandemic. I’m so scared. With everything going on in the world I have this constant anxiety and feel like the world is ending so I know my withdrawals will be mentally harder this time because I’m missing the key ingredient which is hope. Hope for the future without substances. Hope for a better life where I’m not destroying my body and mind with this shit. Now the world is terrifying and depressing and I can’t find the hope. I’m really scared. I’m afraid of having a seizure which I know would be unlikely to happen because I’m not using every day. I’m afraid of how I’m going to keep my job. I’m too scared to go back to rehab and they wouldn’t detox me properly anyway because nobody knows what phenibut is. I also have no way to pay for rehab. I’m on Medicaid and I was able to go last time because my grandparents paid out of pocket for me but they won’t be able to do that again and I couldn’t take their money anyway because I feel like such a shit person for wasting their money and relapsing. For the first time I was able to have some time sober off all mind altering substances so I know it is possible for me to do. I started as a heroin addict and then moved on to these safer substances. Although they won’t make me overdose they absolutely kill my mental health and make me live in torture on a daily basis. I hate myself right now and I just need some words of encouragement. I just need someone to tell me my life isn’t over. Any advice.. just anything. I also haven’t gotten honest with anyone in my life I’m struggling with addiction again so it feels good to just tell on myself and be honest somewhere... thanks for reading my rambling post.",9,{'pandemic': 1},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.74629563}"

About a week ago I woke the fuck up and realized where I got myself, some place I’ve been before with the benzos but never before with the Phenibut. 
It’s been ~48 hours since my last dose of pheni (1g) and am currently tapering off the Xanax with a short supply of Klonopin over the next week or two. 

I’ve successfully tapered off of benzos in the past and the only other time I’ve abused Phenibut like this I tapered off to .5g, but I only abused for about a month that time around.

24 hours after my last dose of pheni I woke up feeling horribly fucking depressed and anxious. This was yesterday. Even while still taking my tapered dose of  Klonopin all I felt all day was anxiety and dread. I was able to finally fall asleep last night with a few nightmares in between.

The strange thing is, today I woke up and the W/D side effects of the pheni don’t seem that bad. 
I’m still on edge but it seems as if the anxiety and hopeless depression has been substantially lowered. 
I just got another package of pheni in the mail that I planned on using to taper down to .25mg with but if what I felt yesterday and last night may have been the peak, should I even bother? 


I’ll also note that I just got scheduled for substance abuse therapy next week and am looking forward to getting clean. Benzos and Phenibut have fucked my life up more than once in the past and I am determined to have a clean and healthy brain again.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.46992582}"

Anyways I wanted to use this post to tell yall what is happening to me currently and see if anybody else has had a similar experience. So I've been lowering my dose steadily over the course of about 2 months. The reason I'm tapering so rapidly is because recently my dose started having adverse effects. I would take it and when it kicked it just made me feel off. Instead of making me feel normal it just made me feel sluggish and jittery. When that started happening I dropped my dose from 3.5 down to 2.5 and immediately started feeling better. Not long after I stabilized at 2.5 THAT dose started making me feel like crap. So I dropped down to 1.5. That dose worked good for about a week than all of a sudden it started making me feel shitty..so here I am at 1 gram daily. I've been taking 1 gram a day for about 3 days now and I feel fine. But I'm sure pretty soon my body force me to go down again. It's like my body is forcing me to taper and I don't even have to try. I'm considering quitting cold turkey and just taking 1 single gabapentin capsule every day.

In the morning I felt ABSOLUTELY normal (Yesterday i woke up crappy AF), had like **1h of hand tremor and sweating. No anxiety.**

Right now it's going to **evening and I've got cold hands, sweating and small headache (Also feeling like my face is filled with blood).** The fear of psychosis is still there, but it's much easier to control myself on it then it was on yesterday. Also **took 150mg caffeine energy drink** (Like 3-5 hours ago), since i was VERY lacking on energy.Maybe that's the reason of cold hands and tremor, also (But i have very high caffeine tolerance). Also got mild heartburn (idk how to call it in english. Like when you ate smth very acidic and it burns in the esophagus), so I took a Rennie.

Hey all. I went through phenibut withdrawals a while ago. It wasn’t easy but I have found kratom much harder to get off of. I successfully tapered down using a chemical similar to baclofen and phenibut, its called 4-fluorophenibut. It could be called fluorodeschlorobaclofen because all that is different between it and baclofen is that it has a fluorine atom in the same spot that baclofen has a chlorine atom. It has a duration of action of 6-8 hours, and is more sedating and less euphoric than phenibut. 

I understand that baclofen might be hard for some people to get, which is why I offer this as an alternative. 

However, being that its essentially a research chemical, care must be taken and it is best to minimize the use of it to when absolutely necessary.

I took 3 doses throughout the day till 7 pm. Alltogether i took 2g yesterday. The effects were very unpleasureable. I   was really depressed' slightly sedated with just a little anxiolysis. My muscles felt also relaxed' but overall it was not positive. I've quit phenibut in the past from a 2 month 2g/day habit in a clinic and i've got 40mg diazepam as a substitute, with tapering down from day to day. My last phenibut consumption was 2 years ago. today the depression is lesser, compared to yesterday, when i took it. I've slept great but i'm really in fear of tingling and rebound effects. Am i maybe lucky with that? because i just dosed one day? If the rebound starts, would it be okay to take 0,5mg ativan to cope with the rebound, or would it make the rebound worse in the long term? I have no benzo tolerance, i didn't consumed benzos either for 2years from an irregular habit. What shoud i expect from my relapse/the rebound in general? I know i'ts different from person to person and i know that i've just to wait and see how it will be, but maybe i just need some support. This relapse is really a personal drama, i was sober for 2years wirh every kind of drug except of coffee, i'm feeling so stupid, immoral and depressed right now. I've gone through a whole year of therapy in germany, and it feels like i've almost destroyed everything, but i guess it's maybe the acute depression which make me think like that.

I dosed irregularly, and had little memory of how much I did in reality. I honestly couldn't even tell when I was high vs when I was on withdrawals, and it was hella intense the whole way as I had no idea whether I should wait for withdrawals or dose again to avoid certain withdrawals.

&#x200B;

But the day I decided to stop, in order to avoid withdrawals, I just sorta chose a random amount and went with it. I may have given myself alot more than I needed, but I just wanted a relative value anyways, that I could slowly ween off. So I'd say I did about 5 or 6 grams a day, and then took off a marginal amount each day until I hit about 1/4 tsp a day. Then I just stopped completely and I was fine.

&#x200B;

So basically my point is- For me, I don't think measuring by the 100mg's is that important... I eye'balled everything and I ended up without withdrawals. Dosing either once or twice a day by the teaspoon was perfect.

I'm supposed to be moving in a month, but once I hit the 3g mark I got completely stuck. I actually ended up having to increase my dose to 4g because I was having nonstop panic attacks without even tapering (which may have actually not been caused by the phenibut, as going up to 4g didn't stop them).

What's worse, though, is all of my other chemical dependencies. I'm also addicted to kratom, taking around 60 gpd. I'm taking 5 or 6 different psychoactive prescriptions and supplements on top of that. One of the worst nails in the coffin is that I've been abusing my seroquel, taking much more than I'm prescribed. I've become dependent on it for sleep over the past couple months, but since I've been abusing it, I'm gonna run out soon, which is going to be a disaster.

Unless I can hit the jackpot and find a psychiatrist who can take me in the next week or so (which is almost unheard of), I'm probably gonna have to go inpatient.

What should I be expecting? My biggest fear (not just with phenibut, but in life in general) is of hallucinating. The thought of losing control of my mind like that terrifies me. The last time I went c/t off phenibut, I had insane psychosis, to the point where, for several days, I did not know where I was or even who I was. At some points I didn't even know I was human. And this was after just 2 months or so of addiction (admittedly, to a higher dose). That said, this was unaided c/t.

Well, I started taking phenibut  like a month or two ago. I made 12 grams in three two-day binges. Then I didnt took it  for two weeks. Then I ate around 30 grams in eight days. And i  had like three days without ingesting anything. Today, I ingested roughly 2 grams and have another gram left. 

I am not into other drugs anymore, but once i experienced stimulant psychosis. 
So im really scared of acute withdrawal with hallucinations and psychosis (i guess that it should be like a delirium tremens, since alcohol is also a gabaergic)

I wanted to quit it cold turkey, since PsychonautWiki says that severe withdrawals are happening to ones ingesting 10g daily for several weeks, but scare got what it has

I also have 25mg lamictal prescribed trice a day and a 60-pack of 100mg seroquel. Would it help somehow to avoid psychotic things?

And the last thing, I never experienced anxiety or panic attacks and took phenibut only on full stomach.

So, am I just anxious with no reason, or I should prepare for worst?

Phenibut has been good to me this past 18 months but i’m playing around with the idea of quitting. I just don’t like the idea of taking this stuff everyday. I know this is a relatively low dose to start quitting Phen but I’m worried about bow long I’ve been taking for and how that will affect my psyche when i eventually quit.  I have an SO now and I notice the days that I don’t take it, I don’t engage with her (anyone really) and all around just feel like being alone.

I know this may sound crazy and the title is weird but I have been taking sleepwalkers for over a year everyday anywhere from 4 to 8 pills a day! Recently I bought a bottle of 20 sleepwalkers, not knowing that they had changed the formula and took me phenibut out, and took my normal dose and within 24 hours I was in full-blown withdrawals and didn't know it. I woke up around 2:30 or 3 in the morning feeling like there was this dark presence behind me while I laid in bed and was in full panic mode! I ended up pacing around my house and then ended up sitting with my knees to my chest and rocking back and forth in my bedroom floor in front of my fan praying for God to help me! After a while I went to the bathroom and ended up throwing up and having diarrhea at the same time! Still in high panic mode, I decided to take a hot bath because that normally calms me down when I am stressed. While the bathtub was filling up and I was sitting in it I was still praying to God for the anxiety and panic to go away and for me to be okay and out of nowhere I had to throw up again. I was fully convinced in my head that I was possessed by some demon and that praying was making me sick! I didn't care how sick it made me I just knew that I needed to keep praying and everything would be okay and so that's what I did and I finally got through it!!! I ultimately I found out the next day that the sleepwalkers no longer have phenibut in them and that's what was making me so sick! It really is criminal and crazy that Red Dawn would take that out of their products without informing anybody because it can cause serious problems!

I started tapering around 6 weeks ago. Not really sure the exact date. I initially cut too fast from 4g to 2.7g the first day, and had pretty severe withdrawals for the next 7-10 days. After the initial first day 1.3g cut, I cut 0.1 per day until I got to 1.4g, at which point I started cutting 0.01-0.05 per day. Probably an average of 0.03g per day. I’m now at 0.6g per day. 

The first week of my taper was terrible and I had severe withdrawal symptoms. I could not leave my apartment without crippling panic attacks, and was afraid they’d never end. However, after around 10 days, once I got to 1.7g per day, my withdrawal symptoms essentially subsided. It has only gotten easier to cut on average about 0.03g per day for the past 3-4 weeks. I don’t feel any craving for the high or anxiety. In fact, I feel better right now at 0.6g per day than I did before I started my taper when I had been 4g per day for many months.

Does this sound like i am hooked on phenibut? Is this withdrawal symptoms??

I have been taking phenibut on and off recreationally for say 6 months but not everyday. I use take it say Wednesdays and Saturdays like 1g - 2g. I then took a break from it for 2 months and got some more so 2 weeks ago.

I took it at Wednesday 1.2g, then Saturday morning 1g and evening 2g and then Wednesday 1.5g and then Saturday morning 1g and evening 2.5g at 5pm my last time that i took it. 

Saturday i have to say that i had a very bad day and wanted to get really f-up(big mistake) so i took all in all 3.5g phenibut in 2 doses, 100mg flmodafinil, 60mg Memantine and 300mg DHP. I have been taking flmodafinil every 2 days at 50mg.

Sunday i had what felt like a crash, i slept the whole day but i have to say i also went to bed at 5am so could of just been tired.

This morning i woke up fine, felt more refreshed and a little agitated but though nothing of it. Around 12pm i started getting very anxious, nervous, agitated and shaking which i thought was weird. I took some L-theanine and it work a little but now i feel the same as 12pm also my blood pressure feels high.

Then i started to get worried and read one could get phenibut withdrawals 72 hours after cold turkey so now i think it could be that.

Do you think it's Phenibut withdrawal? If so were do i go from here to get off it? Should i go back on it if i am already 51 hours off it and if so how much and how do i taper from there??

My phenibut is at work so i can't take it now so i have to wait tomorrow before i can get some.

What's strange, though, is that none of these ""flashbacks"" are of things that actually happened. I also occasionally will get this very faint ""smell"" right before a panic attack, kind of like a musty basement. This one might just be psychosomatic, though.

Once the panic attack sets in, as I said, it is brutal and incapacitating. My heart starts going at the speed of a bullet train, I'll be shaking to the point where my fine motor skills are basically gone. The mental anxiety is terrible, too. Usually, my anxiety is centered around thinking I'm about to start hallucinating, like what happened the last time I went cold turkey off phenibut. Rationally, I know this probably won't happen, because I haven't tapered in ages, but it feels impossible to be rational during these. 

At the beginning, they only happened at night. Usually around 2am. However, recently, I've started having some during the day occasionally. This is *really* bad news, because if I had one at work, I would not be able to continue working. My job is one where only 2-3 people are in the building at once, so I can only leave in an absolute emergency, which, naturally, means I need an explanation to leave. How am I supposed to explain that, especially if I'm shaking and clearly having a panic attack? 

I'm not someone who has ever had random panic attacks, especially to this degree. I'm never in an anxious state of mind when these start. I'm 99% certain that they're chemical. But I have no idea what's causing them. Not only have I not tapered in around 2 months, I've actually increased my dose to 3.5g in the past week, and now 4g in the past couple days. My meds or supplements haven't switched up at all, other than the fact that I'm having to rely much more heavily on benzos (which, it goes without saying, is just asking for trouble). Obviously, I would like to not have to use them, but these are just these inhuman, horrible panic attacks that are almost impossible to just tough out. I'm gonna need to take at least a couple days break now, though, because I've been using benzos (or ambien, when they happen at night) for a couple weeks now, and I'm honestly terrified about it. I'm gonna order some kava so that I at least have *something*, but I don't know how much it'll help. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this or have any ideas? I have no clue what to do here. They've been happening for at least a month, and they're absolutely crippling me. I have a lot going on in life right now on top of it, and these have me at my absolute boiling point. Not to sound dramatic, but life for me at the moment is just plain suffering. I really can't take this. 

Meds and supplements list, in case anything there is relevant:

-Lamotrigine, 150mg 1x/day

-Gabapentin, 300mg 3x/day (I'm somewhat inconsistent with this, but I always have been and it's never been a problem)

-Quetiapine (seroquel), 400mg 1x day 

-Kratom, 50-70 grams throughout the day 

-Memantine, 20mg 1x/day (occasionally I'll do 10mg 2x/day

-NAC, 1000mg 3-4x/day 

And obviously, 4 grams of phenibut per day. With regards to the benzos, I'll take 0.5-1mg of alprazolam when I need it, or 20mg of zolpidem. I've been able to take some days off, either because I was somehow able to to tough out the panic attack or didn't have one, for whatever reason.

I'm nervous about seeing a friend, and feel awkward - should I be? Is that a normal reaction that anyone would feel in that situation, or is my anxiety artifically enhanced? 

Am I justifiably angry at that guy who was rude to me at the gym, or is it just another thing that would've rolled off my back in the days before I got hooked on phenibut? Would sober, recovered me spend quite this much time ruminating on the current state of politics?

Then, when I have a spell of feeling good - happy, present and at peace - is it just because I happen to have hit a well-timed dose? Am I feeling happy because I've genuinely noticed things are going better - or is everything exactly the same, and my mind is simply rewarding me for getting that extra GABA it's been deprived of?

Tapering has really made me recognise the significance of emotions in a healthy brain. They're signals to act and they're rewards for genuinely good things happening. In messing with that delicate balance by getting addicted I've harmed my ability both to motivate myself and to interpret what happens to me objectively.

I will be on 0.7 grams as of tomorrow. I had gotten up to 4.5 grams plus at times over the last year or so. My taper, starting at 3 gpd, and lowering 0.1 grams every other day, has been smooth and seamless. The hardest part was the very beginning. All I could think about was how hard it was going to be, assuming every little thing wrong could be attributed to withdrawals, afraid that I had permanently damaged my liver/kidneys, etc. 

The reason I even bring this up is to let people at the start of their tapers know it’s not always hard and terrible. I have no doubt the stories told on this sub are true. I experienced withdrawals by accident, and they were horrible. I was able to avoid 99% of the worst symptoms. That isn’t to say it’s not uncomfortable at times. I’ll have moments of rapid heart rate or heightened, unexplained anxiety at random times. And sleep is not easy to come by, but that’s the worst of it.

Be kind to yourselves. It’s totally okay, and understandable, to be scared, but it can be done. And hopefully, the experience will be minimal.

Also: I had perfect results on liver and kidney function tests. That put my mind in a different place and made me much more at ease. I hope it puts some of the newer members here at ease, also.",8,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.41774637}"

I remember dreaming this one night as I FINALLY went to sleep. Dreamned about being snatched by one of these demonic sting rays up in the sky. I remembered hearing the wings flap as the eye stared at me. I realized this thing had claws which I forgot to draw. I woke up shortly after, and I did not want to fall asleep again. So I stayed up and continued the CT throughout the night.
