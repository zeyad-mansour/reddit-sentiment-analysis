Would I be good to drink tomorrow night? If not, would it be safe to take... say 10mg of baclofen for a small buzz?",7

I would love to read about some experiences of people here who were able to quit phenibut after a long time of abuse.

I experience very severe depression and anhedonia. Feels like life is over. There some extremely hurting mental pain and inner emptiness. As I would be alive in a dead person.

Did anyone here get back to normal after quitting phenibut? How much time did it take? Did you cold turkey or taper off? Have you used any supplements, nootropics or meds for it? Let me know. I feel so down and like a worthless mess.",4

so I was very successful with tapering off my phenibut. I consumed about 9-15gpd for some months. I'm down on 2.75 right now and decreasing every three days 0.25g. I don't know if this is too much but lately I felt very depressive and anhedonic again. Like a incredible big pain of inner emptiness, radical and often occuring negative thoughts (first thing in the morning) and just feeling dead alive as nothing would matter. I'm not able to feel joy, I don't have any appetite, there's nothing that stimulates or interest me and something is extremely painful all the time. I have restless legs and very bad negativ thoughts and lethargy when waking up. I just feel really horrible and bad about myself, my past and my future. It's hell. 

I also consumed kratom the last two weeks because I had to study for an exam and kratom always helped me with that. Additionally it probably also was much easier to study for the exam without the withdrawal effects of phenibut. I wrote my exam 3 days ago and reduced my kratom to once in the morning.

Just now after not using kratom anymore the effects start coming again so I'm questioning myself if these horrible effects come from quitting and withdrawing kratom or if kratom withdrawals wouldn't be that bad after two weeks and it's just the phenibut withdrawal I didn't feel that much the last two weeks because of kratom. I mean now I'm also on a reduced dose of my typical old phenibut dose (2.75g).

What would you say? And did anyone of you have experience with kratom for phenibut withdrawal?",4

The effects were really, really nice. I just felt really relaxed and content, and I slept really well afterwards.

The next couple days were strange though. Although there was no physical hangover, I felt pretty off, depressed and borderline suicidal. My imagination seemed more vivid (not necessarily in a pleasant way). The next day that I slept after taking it, as I was waking up, it sounded like there were people talking in my room. I was still kind of half asleep so I didn't think much of it at the time. When I fully woke up, I realized there was no one there and it was an auditory hallucination I had experienced. Is this all withdrawal from just one single day of taking it? It kind of just makes me want to throw the rest out because although the effects were really pleasurable, it's not worth the strange after effects.

I think I'd rather just stick to occasional alcohol use because the effects were pretty similar for me. I can deal with a physical hangover the next day, and after that I'm perfectly fine. The Phenibut was just on another level...",4

I found him crashed on our bed with his gaming headphones on. He was completely out and doesn’t remember going to bed.

I woke up to him stumbling around at 6am. He was repeating “tired” over and over again.

He woke up later in the morning and kept falling back asleep. He’d fall asleep for 10-30 second chunks. Fell asleep sitting up and even standing up.

I’ve never seen him high so I was freaking out. He asked to go for a nap and then I called his parents over. We couldn’t wake him up with everything we tried. Called 911 and the medics were able to wake him by gagging him while trying to get an airway tube in.

He spent 3 hours in the hospital being monitored and on IV and was sent home. We talked for a bit. He napped for a few hours and later tonight he was vomiting up a storm.

He didn’t realize he’d taken so much and the doctor said sometimes the scales are scarily inaccurate and he could’ve taken around 3 grams one time.

He’s taking tomorrow off work because he’s still visibly ill.

My question is what do I need to be prepared of as his wife to support him. He took it to see if it could help his depression.

Is it dangerous for him to have come off it like that after one hit of it?

How long after did you experience insomnia?

Now I’ve gone 90 days today without using and I was wondering if anybody else has had this interaction with alcohol and when it might be safe to drink again.

Also, I’d decided to quit because of memory problems and just looking and sounding fucked up when I was on it. Couldn’t think straight either.  Had problems turning on the tv and changing channels. I couldn’t figure it out under the influence.

I noticed no differences and had no issues sleeping. I may have actually slept better because of the stronger sedative effect. Will repeat this process for a week and then next week will drop the Phenibut dose to 4.1 gpd and sub 10 mg Baclofen.

I plan on dropping 500 mg per week and subbing an additional 5 mg Baclofen for every 500 mg drop as the weeks go by. I will keep updating my progress on here.

Those who have experience with using Baclofen and this 500 mg per week taper method, is it sustainable and slow enough to mitigate withdrawal effects?

I’m still shocked that no one around me could detect how detached I was. 
Anyway, the withdrawal has been hell. I’ve gone through every single symptom and time is moving so slowly. Around day 7, I did start sleeping again and the extreme vertigo/light headed feeling subsided. Also, the ringing in my ears decreased. Just the slightest relief in those areas gave me hope and I felt like I’d made it through the worst of it. 
But, my god, it’s still the worst headspace I can ever remember being in. Everything feels and seems dark. Nothing, other than sleeping, brings me any relief and the nightmares are so bad, I almost hate to sleep. I’m trying to stay hydrated, move more and meditate but just those tiny steps toward recovery is exhausting. 
I know this will pass. I know it takes a long time to heal. I don’t even know why I’m sharing this other than to be able to express it to others who understand the pure agony of this withdrawal.

I have been taking 5.1 grams of Phenibut daily for quite some time now, coming at about a year of daily dosage of that level and before that, roughly 2 years of 2-3 gpd.

I have Baclofen and today cut my dose of Phenibut down to 4.6 grams and took a 5 mg Baclofen to compensate for the -500 mg of Phenibut based on my research.

I have been too dependent on Phenibut these past years and I’ve learned a lot from my experiences and it’s time to make the move to get off the stuff. I still have roughly 700 grams of Phenibut to gradually taper off and have a good supply of Baclofen to assist me in getting off.

This will be a gradual long taper to minimize withdrawals and assume I’ll be tapering/subbing Baclofen for roughly the next 20 weeks.

I will continue to update my results in this subreddit.

So I’ve already started my taper by cutting out 500mg. The burning sensation in my arms, face and legs are are worse but the tinnitus is a whole lot better. For some reason it acts up when I smoke my vape but that’s about it. 

I’m experiencing something that I don’t think I’ve heard of which is extreme tiredness. I’ll randomly pass out while watching TV or just get so tied that I have to lay down and I’ll fall asleep this is most pronounced during the day. I guess because at night I’m actually trying to sleep so it doesn’t bother me.

I’ve been taking 3gpd for about 4 months and before that I was taking 1.5gpd for about a year. 

I have some comfort meds which I’ve been taking at night as the skin burning and tingling in my fingers makes it hard to lay down and sleep.

These are the meds I’ve been prescribed for years now:

1mg Klonopin 2x a day
30mg Temazepam at bed time 
900mg gabapentin 
875mg Depakote
100mg Bupropion SR(which I’ve been reluctant to take during the withdrawals)
2mg Prazosin 
40mg Latuda

It seems like the gabapentin doesn’t help me at all with the tingling or burning feeling unless I take a dose of 2400mg/day so I’ve been skipping days that way I can get some relief.

I haven’t really been experiencing any anxiety which is great. I think that’s mostly due to the Klonopin. My heart rate during the day ranges from the mid 80s-100bpm which is normal for me.

I also got some agmatine and have been taking 1.25g 2x a day. Honestly not sure if that’s doing anything. 

So here’s my plan.
2.5gpd for 2 weeks
2gpd for 2 weeks
1.5gpd for 2 weeks
1.2gpd for 2 weeks
900mg/day for 2 weeks
600mg/day for 2 weeks
300mg/ day for 2 weeks

What I'm thinking is trying a more incremental taper with the baclofen. Basically, what I'm thinking is something like this. I'm at 4.5g/day currently. What I want to try is starting on 5mg of baclofen, then going down 150mg (or 150, 150, 200 to make it more precise) a day of phenibut on that. After the 3 days I'd add another 5mg of baclofen and repeat.

This would mainly make me feel better in that I know from experience that if a 150mg drop is too much and I don't fix it in time that it's not gonna become a week long anxious trainwreck like it does with 500mg. 


Do you guys think that would this work out alright or do you think that something screwy would happen with my tolerance on a taper schedule like that and end up making things worse? I know no one can give a definite answer to most of this stuff because of all the different factors at play, but I'm just looking for some input from people who may be more knowledgeable than me.",2

I finally had decided to do therapy and see a psychiatrist. After the long wait, because I am with Kaiser, I was told that the psychiatrist couldn’t help me and that I would have to go to a psychiatric institute. Almost made me give up on quitting and so far I haven’t even attempted. Finally, I’m going to try to quit but I won’t be getting help. I’m not going to the psychiatric institute because it costs money that I will not have. Also, I am a full time student and a part time worker. This shit sucks because I’ve taped down from 7-8g at one point(about a year ago if I had to guess) down to 4g and wasn’t able to get lower than that. I’ve been stuck since December of 2018 and I do not want to wait until the new year, with new health insurance, to get help. I haven’t tried to taper again and I thought I would finally get the help that I needed. Instead Kaiser just scams by making us pay for these appointments that render us useless. Fuck Kaiser permanente and fuck all the doctors I have seen there. The endocrinologist will not prescribe my testosterone, tells me to send him paper work(so I go out of my way to do so), then tells me that I have to bring him a hard copy. I’m about sick and tired of these stupid ass fucking Indian ass doctors that I can’t understand. I am a pretty humbled man, but I can say for a fact that I am smarter than these stupid fucks. They do not give a shit about you. These doctors have made my life worse ever since I decided to get help for my depression and anxiety 5 or 6 years ago. Those antidepressants ruined my life. Then my new doctor puts me on testosterone. Then I don’t get any help from Kaiser. I cancelled my therapy appointment because I decided that it’s a waste of fucking time and money. I started microdosing recently and taking supplements and got addicted to phenibut years ago. Fuck phenibut and fuck addiction and a big fuck you to big pharma and shit ass doctors. The pharmaceutical companies suck too and they’re the ones to blame. Tell me how my sex life was amazing and then next thing I know I am cumming in 20 seconds. Then I get addicted to phenibut and last and hour, but the only problem is the numb feeling and no drive. Then I got erectile dysfunction and that’s why I was put on testosterone. The testosterone has been a tremendous help, but this new endocrinologist thinks he knows everything and says that testosterone has nothing to do with erectile dysfunction. I’ve read that in an article too buddy, but the only problem with that is how my dick decides to work now that I’m on testosterone and he will not give me more. Sorry I had to rant. Fuck phenibut and a big fuck you to all the doctors that have fucked me over. Now ima have to order my testosterone online and get some damn HCG or something. I have these tiny ass balls now and may not be able to have kids one day(my doctor didn’t tell me about that). My doctor also didn’t tell me about the sexual side effects with the antidepressants.

I never weighed it out. I just kind of eyeballed it with the little spoon that came with it. I’d estimate maybe 2.5 g or so. It seemed to always help in not having a bad day. I’m not saying it made every day good just made it suck less. Like many people, I underestimated how much of an effect it was really having on me. One day I just didn’t feel like taking it and my day was absolutely terrible. That’s when I knew I had fallen victim to the addiction. I tried tapering alone but even that was brutal. 

I knew I couldn’t do this any longer especially alone. I was scared because of all of the horror stories I’ve read about getting off of phenibut. I finally told my doctor that I needed help. He wasn’t familiar with phenibut but actually listened to what I had to say. I told him about Baclofen including the case study on the NIH website. He agreed that something definitely needed to be done and prescribed me Baclofen. He also said don’t hesitate to contact him if I need any more help with it. To be treated with respect and to be taken seriously really means the world to me. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I actually have a glimmer of hope. I mean sure I still do feel shitty trying to taper off the phenibut alone but I now have confidence that I can do it thanks to my doctor. I can’t wait to start tapering with baclofen.

When will the extreme depression go away?

Just figured it was like opiate withdrawals and mostly physical, and that I wasn’t at risk because of the breaks I took in between supply.* 
So a little back story. I tried phenibut for the first time a few years ago, only used it a couple times then forgot about it. Then in the middle of July of this year I ordered a bottle of 60 250mg capsules. Towards the end I was taking about 5 250mg capsules at a time, once a day. That bottle lasted me about 2 months, so I didn’t take it every day, and it was probably about 2 weeks until I ordered another bottle of 30 250mg capsules. I noticed no withdrawal effects whatsoever, just liked that feeling of motivation, anti-anxiety properties, deep sleep, and social boost it gave me. At this point I was up to 1.7g a day and the bottle lasted me a week and it was about 3 days before I got my next batch. Still no noticeable withdrawals. Began again at around 1.5g a day for probably a week and a half, and then didn’t order anymore because I didn’t think I needed to and was trying to save money. Well at around day 3 the vivid nightmares were unreal, day 4 and I had constant hot flashes all day, subtle anxiety, a deep deep deep sense of sadness, like a dark cloud was just following me around and nothing felt good or ok. Just very gray and cold. It’s now day 5 and the depression is at an all time high. It’s almost 10pm at night and has gotten a little bit bitter, but it’s still there. I had a very rough day, and didn’t know why so I looked into phenibut withdrawal and think I found my answer. My question is how long should I anticipate going through this before the depression/ anxiety gets better? And any tips or tricks for that depressed state in the meantime? I’m also on a script for 20mg ir adderall 3x a day, started back on my 20mg Prozac daily and have a script for hydroxyzine but I rarely ever take it. Baclofen and gabapentin aren’t an option, either are benzos. And I’d rather not take any more phenibut to taper. But the depression is debilitating. I also just ordered a bottle of lithium orotate and am hoping that will help but it won’t be here for 3 days. Any advice, reassurance, ideas, or words of encouragement would be extremely helpful right now as I’m a recovering heroin & Xanax addict and this feeling of hopelessness is really triggering my urge to use...",5

Kratom may have been the spark, but phenibut lit the fire. 

&#x200B;

In 12 days it will be a year since I had my last drink. After a three week stent in detox, I got out and was being driven mad with cravings for two weeks before I turned to kratom. I had tried kratom in a previous sobriety attempt and it worked fairly well for me for 72 days before an intense depressive episode helped me lean back into another long bender. I was fine with the kratom, dosing 5g 3x a day. Didn't mess with it for a while, brought it down to 2x day. I was also prescribed 400mg Seroquel, ever since detox for help controlling mood swings.

Fast forward 9 months. Life has been bleh. Not much drive to do anything, not completely covid related, I'm an introvert, but no drive to even play video games. Strum on a banjo or guitar sometimes, started college again at 30, mostly just pretend to do school work like a child because I can't focus. Started looking into the strongest nootropics because in my stupid mind, I've done hard drugs it will probably take a lot to effect me.  

Penibut was, of course, the first pick. Took me a few weeks of 2x a week to find a good dose for me. I figured out less was more for me when compared to others experiences, so I landed on 500mg. Then starts the irrational decision making....started ordering other nootropics so I could have something on my phenibut off days. Ended up trying to cycle phenyl, adrafinil, and phenibut into a week schedule with one totally off day. Ended up reducing my kratom to 3g or twice a day, who knows why.

Not sure how long that cycling went on. Probably 2 or 3 weeks until somehow I landed on taking 300mg of phenibut every day, maybe once a week I would mix in phenyl or adrafinil. This has been going on for almost 2 months. And I had completely forgotten until today that there were days, at least once a week where I told myself I needed an extra kick to get everything done that day, I know I took a gram a couple times, and I think 750mg the other days. 

I think my tolerance just spiked, because the last two weeks my anxiety has gotten progressively worse to the point of being unmanageable today. The last time I took a higher dose was Tuesday, I was going zero today but ended up caving at about 3pm and taking the 300mg. 

Just a lot of shame today figuring out the bad choices I have rationalized recently as if I didn't know better. Also wanted to point out that until today, in the back of my mind I have been telling myself that I've only been taking phenibut daily for a month. It's actually been over 2.

Did 1-2g per day for a month and recently got a bottle of ghb.
Before the ghb I had 9 days of on and off dosing usually a low dose every 2-3 days now after also dosing ghb for 11 hours a day straight I got minor whitdrawal like heart palpations sweating anxiety just 4h after the ghb. 
I just consumed 500mg phenibut (twice daily) for a 50mg-day taper.
If I can stabalize myself whit phenibut then I'll trash the ghb
Any input?

EDIT: 1h past pheni consumption and just consumed 75mg of caffeine.
It seems like I'm doing better rn.
Is it necessary to get first a week on the maintenance dose whit a phenibut taper?
Like w benzo they'll first switch to a long acting benzo and use it for a minimum for a week to get a stable blood level before the introduce a taper.

Since I didn't use phenibut in 2 days I don't have any form of stable blood levels.
Would it be necessary to stabalize the dose first?

EDIT2: what to expect from a taper and is there really any conceivable difference between fast normal and slow.

EDIT3: a 50mg a day taper should put me on sober in 20 days and I'd use up jsut 10.5(starting from 1g a day assuming doing ghb for half the day didn't rape my tolerance. 
I would still get heavy sleep from the 3-5g range stated by erowid but noticed that the lower range of that did not. 
I've like 50-60 grams left will weigh it later this night.
But safe to say I could easily go slower.

EDIT4:and whit this taper in how many doses should I split the total dose.

EDIT5: trew away the ghb.
I've enough phenibut to get though whatever happens.
And if not it's 1 click and 1 day away

EDIT5: I'll not dose any more phenibut and evaluate if it was just rebound.",1

To anyone new to it, try 500mg-1000mg with your normal dose of phenibut. It may make it WAY stronger than usual. I was able to cut my dose in half the next day.

I took fasoracetam and agmatine because I read those can help with big cuts. I also have a naltrexone prescription for my alcoholism which I take daily. Now come to today in the past week I have got my daily dose down to 5g a day. I don't know why I have yet to feel any withdrawal symptoms and I'm scared they're gonna hit me like a truck in the coming days. I used for about 3 months starting at 5g a day and going up to 30g a day. Am I just lucky? What should I do next? This is my first experience with Phenibut and I'm not fucking with it again after I get clean this time. What suggestions do you guys have for me? Should I just continue making the cuts I have been making and pray I am an anomaly?,1

I withdrew once from being on 6mgpd of klonopin and it was at least a year of suffering for me before I felt like I had my life back. So I know what benzo withdrawal can be like. I was inpatient for two months among other things. Like a very dumb person i started taking phenibut for a while (one year now) and had already been taking it a few months when I thought I could just stop taking it. That's when I found out phenibut's similarity to benzos and the magnitude of what I facing hit me. I've been avoiding getting off of it but I've got to do it. I plan on asking my doctor for something and he won't give me benzos because of the struggle he knows I had before. So I see gabapentin discussed on here and was thinking about asking for that. I'm just not sure what to expect though. Why do I get myself in these predicaments?",6

I thought I had the flu. I had almost no other flu symptoms. 


I've been waking up after sleeping for 4 hours, usually pretty warm. I get up, and stay up for about an hour and go back to bed. This is almost religious unless I eat enough THC brownies.

I'm still having symptoms today, just not as many and way less severe. I haven't go sick or dry heaved except for 1 night in the last couple weeks.  My main concern is that I STILL have no appetite. I'm able to eat maybe 1 small meal a day.


My body just won't let me chew.

Are these long-term symptoms of W/D or could this be something else. I just want to be able to eat normally again.

I feel fine during the day. Kind of lethargic, nothing major though. I recently started to take just 1 300mg a day for now and it seems to curb the issues. I still have quit a large supply of them, but I'd like to quit.",4

i dosed every morning, sometimes redosing within the day with 500 mg. i combined it with an etizolam binge at the same time, as well as alcohol (extremely retarded i know) and that just made things worse

ive been off of it for ... id say 72 hours now and yesterday i cried all day and had the worst nightmares. ive been crying all day today as well.

i had the most vivid dreams of my entire life, no joke. it was 7 hours of being stuck in a loop of waking up, talking to my boyfriend on my phone only for something either sexual or absolutely terrifying to happen. i was well aware i was dreaming and tried countless times to wake up but i couldnt. woke up so panicked i couldnt fall back asleep. nightmares included stuff like my brother being this vivid demon i cant describe because it was just so fucked speaking in tongues, and dying. theres so much more but it was endless waking up within a dream and it would feel super lifelike.

ive been nauseous since last night and the rebound anxiety is going to kill me it feels. i have cold-like symptoms and the chills and hot flashes so bad i cant stop sweating through my clothes. please dont be stupid like i am. im only posting this to share my experience as a warning, as well as ask if this has happened to anyone else as well, and any tips. id buy marijuana to help with the dreams but when i get my paycheck i need to give it all to my family + a friend and i wont get paid again until the end of the month. i have literally nothing to help except maybe kava and i dont want to sleep or eat ever again.

But today, I had a sleep aide since I was going to do a semi-larhe cut and was previously exhausted, accidentally fell asleep before 9pm, waking up at 1:55am missing my 10pm dose feeling the intense anxiety, sweating, shaking and raised heart rate/tachycardia. So I took my dose, and feel better now.. it just offset my sleepschedule though due to the come up times.



Was it okay that I took my second dose 4 hours later than normal? Is it anything to be literally sweating over it, and feeling like I fucked up everything?

Panicking, i hit up all the head shops only to find out that sleepwalker and limitless no longer put phenibut in their products.

I was waiting for the bevy of shit side effects to hit when curiously they really didn’t... 48hrs in the only new symptom was increased anxiety but totally manageable. I read that it could take 3-4 days for dts and psychosis to set in, so I went to a minute med to get 10mg baclofen just in case. Day four five and six were all the same (rough rls, anxiety and irritation) just a little better every day. No depression, no insomnia, no psychotic thoughts, no anhedonia; no Hell. Being a spineless idiot, I dosed Thursday whenever it came but at 3.5 instead of my usual 5.5 grams and it felt like I took 8gs at once.

started my taper feb 6th of this year after a late parcel forced me to cold turkey for 7days the withdrawal scared me so bad i had to get off, think i have ptsd from it.

my taper had many ups and downs, some really awful days some really good days, but i could never stick to a plan. i dont know how many times i had to restart my taper. i started my taper feb 6th at 6gpd and after fucking up so many times i once restarted at 8gpd. i always knew in the back off my mind when i was getting outta control and was time to restart my taper.

2months ago i started getting serious and said enough was enough. i tapered down to 3.5gpd and kept a normal taper of 100-200mgs a day and adding baclofen when it started getting uncomfortable. i made it to 1gpd phenibut but was needing need double the baclofen as per said 10mg = 1 gram so i was taking up to 80mgs baclofen to cover withdrawal. i made this switch in less than a week so i blame that for my first failed baclofen attempt. i was having internal vibrations so bad i had to jump back on phen. for my jump back to phen i started at 7.5gpd and restarted my taper thinking the amount of baclofen may have increased my tolerance back up that much. dont know if it did or not but i felt safe there. this was 40days ago.

since then ive now done an agressive taper with etizolam for assistance and 2 days ago made it down to 1gpd. my wall was always 3.1gpd but easily went past that. my goal this time was to go slow and replace 5mgs bac per 500mg phen at a time stay a week and repeat. but im just so eager to be done that but this time i made the jump from phen to bac all at once. today i am 55hrs since my last dose of phen and using 25mgs baclofen and my only symptoms are hot/cold and sweaty feet. i expect it to get worse so i am prepared but pretty happy with this attempt so far.

and for those thinking using the etizolam for help is a bad idea yea it bc i do i have slight dependance on it so i order 500mg 10mg/ml diclazepam to taper off with if i find it to hard to taper etiz alone or ct. i use 3mgs etiz not daily.

anyways im just so proud of myself  being where im at today and couldnt be more thankful for this sub and the many many ppl who gave me advice at the start off all this. i will not be leaving this sub like most people quit i will always be here to give advice and support. thanks all.",13

That turned into taking a lil bit of kratom while on phenibut to feel a euphoria I can't only explain as magical on the first try. Slowly but surely this became my new addiction. Wake up take phenibut then take kratom 2 times a day. Then it became take phenibut and kratom 2 times a day. Then by March covid19 hit and I lost my job. Being at home bored I started uping my doses on phenibut. I started with 1 gram but by the time I realized I was taking anywhere frm 4 to 8 grams a day. I'm an outdoorsman so I would leave my city and head to the mountains taking phenibut and kratom trying to get my mind off of losing my job and the virus. I didn't get any unemployment so I started using more and more from my anxiety. I started getting real bad stomach cramps, stomach burning from upper right abdominal area to the middle. Horrible nights of pain anxiety and realization of me slowly dieing. At this point I got called back to work with a heavy addiction in June. I had no choice but to continue work with a full blown addiction to high doses of both substances. The pain and anxiety would go hand in hand. I managed to go to work while being on phenibut and kratom everyday. But the pain and anxiety was catching up to me. 1 week ago I decided enough. I stopped cold turkey both substances. On last Friday I took my last doses went to a local river with my dog and enjoyed my day knowing this could be my last day enjoying anything for a while. Starting Saturday I've been off of both substances and I can truly say today is the first morning I woke up feeling a lil okay to actually sign up to reddit and post. My stomach pain was the worst part of the withdrawal. I jacked up my insides for sure. I lost 15 lbs during this last week by stress withdrawal and not being able to eat anything because of my pain.

I have virtually no xanax tolerance so even .5mg will have me feeling pretty relaxed. I only have a few 1mg ones so I’ll have to use them sparingly though.

Let me just cut to the chase. I started phenibut at the end of August. Started off at 500mg daily for anxiety and it made me feel super.  I also started uni then and it helped me out a lot. But the tolerance came up quickly and I started to take more: 1GPD, 1.5, 2, till I took like 4g or 5g last sunday which was definitely too much. So, this week I started a fast taper starting monday.  Took 3g on monday, 2.5g on tuesday,  2g on wednesday  and today I took 1.5g.  I split the doses throught the day (e.g. tuesday I started the day with 1g, another 1g around noon and 500mg around dinner).

Here where it gets weird. I get WD-like reactions two hours after I take a dose. Red flushes, anxious, shaky, rise in BP. I've noticed it during the whole week, it's definitely from the onset of the dose. It's like taking phenibut makes me feel worse than not taking it. But I take it because I'm scared I'll get a major rebound after a day or so (I'm really anxiety prone, and have had my fair share of pretty horrible anxiety quitting benzo's and booze).

Has anyone had this before?  Also, what course of action would you guys suggest? I know how my body reacts to GHB, benzo's and alcohol (and coming off those), but phenibut is totally new to me and I can't quite put my finger on what it's doing to me.

Cheers!",1

I already go through interdose withdrawals and phenibut isnt even beneficial nor does it give me the same effects anymore as when I first took it, so let me preface my dilemma. So first off I've never really posted on here before or reddit period. I usually just surf through it and read posts for encouragement, advice, or just all around being curious. I'm currently at 8gpd, I've tapered down over the last 2 weeks from 13gpd, stupid I know so you dont have to iterate that or tell me. Ive also been using it since may, so approximatley about 5 months. I was reckless with my dosing because of job troubles, relationship problems etc. I was stupid about it, again, I know BUT i only take it once in the morning and I'm usually always good until the next day. The problem I'm having is daily expenses have finally caught up with me and the price of phenibut itsself is now too much, which I knew would happen eventually. I basically have a new tub of phenibut, well, semi new, 125 grams right now but wont be able to get another one and I'm ready to tackle withdrawals head on and make the jump, just been too worried about them until now tbh. Ive gone through them once for 3 days but the constant skin crawling, extreme anxiety, i already suffer from GAD which is why i took phenibut in the first place because like everyone it really was helpful in the beginning. Any advice on how to rapid taper my last supply so my withdrawals aren't excruciating, even though know they'll be bad and i did this to myself. Supplement tips? Ive tried ashwagandha and its 50 50. It helps with my anxiety sometimes or makes my anxiety worse so i tend to avoid it. Kava kava helps tremendously if i take it one day then dont take it for a day etc. All around advice? I've been alheavily ddicted to benzos(xanax, klonopin) in the past and have white knuckled those c/t everytime and miraculously made it out okay even from high mg. I'm just finally ready to make the jump and want to know how painlessly, maybe, I can go about this. Yes, I should've planned better for this but here I am with no choice and no outlet except you guys. I've seen the horror stories and the great stories of people c/t jumping from higher doses then me so all in all I'm just looking for feedback, help, advice, encouragement and so forth. Thanks in advance guys. Sorry if I left anything out or if my post is kind of everywhere. This is my first time posting ever on reddit so give me some leeway, if any lol I forgot to mention I'm also in a relationship and want to know the best way to tell my gf how bad it may get. She knows I take it and saw me go through 3 day hell once because of usps, damn postal service. Shes very understanding and has seen and helped me through benzo withdrawals and told me shed help me through it but I dont think she understands how truly excruciating it can get especially the anxiety part and the fact I have GAD.

I started taking sleepwalkers almost 2 years ago. Not knowing they had phenibut in them. So after about 9 months...I did research and started to make my own. This is the point where I figured out they were addictive (should have known bc of the way they made me feel). Anyways...I made my own for a little over a year and decided they just really weren't doing it for me anymore. Just wasn't the same as in the beginning. I am also a recovering meth/alcohol addict and I believe they helped me in early sobriety. But at this point I just don't want to be dependent on anything. So I decided to quit. I did have the help of my sponsor, but honestly didn't really need it. 

I have been taking about 5-7 pills each day having about 1/2 gram among a few other ingredients including 110 mg of caffeine. 

I usually take 3 in the morning. Then the rest spread through the day, one or two every few hours.

So I dropped to 2 in the morning and just one in the afternoon for 2 days. Then 1 in the morning and 1 midday for 2 more days. Then I just stopped completely. 
Honestly the hardest was when I dropped to 2 a day or the equivalent of 1gpd. After that it's been pretty easy. 

I've used a little kratom to help compensate. I don't usually use it so I dont use much maybe a gram or 2 at the most. The best thing that helped me with keeping my energy level has been using pre-work out in the morning and hitting the gym ....this has helped so much. 

Its been almost a week since I quit and I'm not having any issues other than some dizziness every now and then, and my caffeine intake has significantly increased bc the sleepwalkers really gave me a lot of energy. So I'm still looking for something to help with that, but overall I thought it would have been much worse. I basically went from 3gpd for 2 years to nothing within a week and I'm actually pretty good",3

I've been taking phenibut as a replacement for it for about the last 6 months, haven't been on gabapentin in years but was very successful. I take it for anxiety/insomnia issues as well as a preventative measure for headaches caused by nerve damage in my neck.    
    

So after coming clean with my doctor, he told me he had never even heard of phenibut. I told him I was taking 2 grams per day (really it's up to 3 some days, but I have no problem getting by on 2.)    
    

After he crunched some information on Google and a couple studies, he has advised a quick taper:    
5 days at 1500mg    
5 days at 1000mg    
5 days at 500mg and begin gabapentin    
Off phenibut, strictly on gabapentin    
    

Does this seem like a good plan? I've tapered off of phenibut before from 2.5g down to 150mg but over the course of a couple months. I don't foresee me having any problem cutting from 2-3g a day to 1.5g immediately, but does anyone have any first hand experience with doing this?    
    
I really would like to try to stick with what my doctor recommends as closely as possible, and I would just love some input from people who have done a relatively quick taper and also transitioned directly onto gabapentin. Also, I haven't picked up the script yet, so I'm not entirely sure what the dosage of the gabapentin is yet. He didn't exactly clarify. Any info on that would be appreciated. I got mixed results when searching.

No clue why, don't care to figure it out. Maybe because my system goes offline for a bit, restarts, there's a spike of something or other, who knows. Sometimes it takes a while for those to go away, if they do completely before I goto sleep for the night a few hours later. The mind chalks it up to the previous dose wearing off and WD symptoms starting.

I thought about it and realized I don't have any of those problems before I take it in the earlier day, or if so definitely nothing comparable, so there was something to it. I take agmatine with each dose and it wasn't doing it so I stopped thinking it could be NMDA related, or if it was, that agmatine wasn't going to help. Well, I had some cough syrup that was only DXM, 15mg per teaspoon, and measured out 2 because I don't like the way too much of it makes me feel.

I took it and over the course of 30-45min I noticed the symptoms lessening slightly at first, then quite a bit, and it basically went away completely. Normally I'd be anxious about taking the phenibut dose at this point but I basically feel fine.

I haven't been able to enjoy smoking even the smallest amount of THC without it making the vibrations and anxiety extremely bad. To test *that*, I reluctantly packed a small toke and told myself I was going to regret it, but sure enough, it worked. No problems at all.",3

Also sometimes I get random crazy loud tinnitus. Anyone have a timeline as to when any of these things go away?,When I say a heavy heartbeat it’s not that it’s going faster it’s that it feels like somebody is like tapping my chest and it’s way more powerful than normal. Also I will randomly spike into far higher anxiety than normal which I hate. The tinnitus is honestly the least of my issues as I had tinnitus already (thanks to the 12 times I’ve seen excision lmao) and I more or less ignore it,3

2020-10-04 00:36:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/j4t5mq/kava_kava/,Kava Kava?,"I've Kava Kava mentioned quite a few times, on this subreddit using it for tapering. I take lexapro for OCD, and mirtazapine for sleep already and found the mirtazapine to actually be beneficial for tapering/making cuts at my night dose, and klonopin daily for 8 years for tourettes, it doesn't help really, but slightly does. 

Medication aside that I currently take, I thought to mention them as I've noticed they all do slightly help tapering and making cuts, so I thought I'd note them for other people..

But back to the main topic, as I've seen Kava Kava mentioned frequently on here in tapering.. I've went ahead and bought the yogi kava tea bags, and I'm honestly wondering how long does it take to actually be beneficial and start working? As I've had my first drink tonight with around 4 bags with 2 being suggested for sleep. And honestly I haven't noticed anything different, as it seems I feel the mirtazapine is doing a better job still at helping tonight.

I've done some digging around and some people said it takes days for kava to build up to have effect? I'm getting mixed answers. In your experiences, how long did it take for kava to be effective and actually help? Or are the yogi tea bags just not effective enough/possibly just need to use more bags?


As I'm looking to use the kava kava for cutting the night dose further, even though the mirtazapine helps, I'm still decreasing just by 20/feeling hesitant to decrease the night dose. But I have yet to feel any effects/relief from the kava kava drink I had a few hours ago? I took it before my night dose aswell, so I didn't take my dose yet... I just don't feel the kava doing anything?",3

Any input would mean the world,"So. I have myself in a pretty terrible situation. I just recently decided to pick Phenibut up again after going 3-4 months without it at a very high dose. I thought I could handle it and go a day or 2 and just not touch it again. But I simply couldn't. I am and always will be an addict. I quickly got back up to 20 gpd for a couple months. I ended up getting a court date for something that happened long before quarantine and realized that I had to quit phenibut now before trying to go through all of that in jail. I've been on a pretty steady rapid taper, and sometimes I can get away with only 5-6 gpd. I only have about 3 weeks left to taper before I have to jump completely. I had actually pre jumped the last 3 days to see what I would feel like without any right now. Last 2 days weren't terrible, but today was AWFUL. I literally could walk or speak when I tried to get out of bed. I had no cognitive function at all. When my girlfriend went to work I was losing my mind because I thought for sure that I was going to have to call the Psych ward. So I had to eventually take 5 grams throughout the day, but my brain and cognitive function just isn't there... So I'm not sure what to do. Maybe see if I could go to rehab for a month or 2 before sentencing? I have some 10mg baclofen tablets I can use, but I'm not too sure what the ratio should be. I honestly just want to go a facility and do it in a safe controlled environment, but I don't know if it's a possibility. This may be the biggest battle of my life, and I'm not sure if I have the fight in me..",1

I know when you’re going through it having people tell you you’ll get better doesn’t help really...  but it gets better man. 

I had to CT my phenibut because it turned on me so badly, it was almost worse to take it then to WD from it. I started taking gabapentin and at really high doses, that worked for a week until it made me feel worse. It felt like my body was shutting down, I remember driving down the highway in the middle of the night in a straight panic (I don’t recommend this.) All in all guys, you’ll heal. Going through it, it felt like I broke my brain. Taking phenibut multiple times a day along with kratom, it was bound to go to shit.


Just wanted to give some encouragement. I still have tons of phenibut and have ZERO interest in that shit. Just wasn’t meant to be.",13

I started phenibut 2 months ago not realizing how addictive it was and for the past month I’ve been tapering down. I’m down to 425mg per day, but it seems even when I drop 25mg I have trouble sleeping, stomach problems, and slight anxiety. This is nothing major, but I’d like to avoid feeling this way for another few weeks. 

I used morphine a few nights ago and it killed all these symptoms. Obviously I don’t want to use morphine on a daily basis, but I was thinking maybe increasing my Kratom doses would have a similar effect. I already take 7.5-10gpd of kratom so I was thinking of just adding a few grams to each dose. Kratom dependency doesn’t scare me like phenibut.

I was supposed to go down to 3.2 gpd but took 6.5 gpd. I fear that it might have spiked my tolerance because I’ve been taking 3.3 gpd for the past couple days to let the extra phenibut make its way out of my system, and I started feeling rebound anxiety last night and this morning. I’m thinking of waiting at least 1 more day before I continue my taper, and I’m going to try to start going to the gym because I’ve hardly worked out for the past couple weeks and I think that’s contributing to the extra depression and anxiety that I’ve been feeling. What sucks is that the depression and anxiety make it harder to go to the gym, but not going to the gym makes my depression and anxiety worse, so it becomes this endless cycle. 

Yesterday I’ve started to cut my vyvanse doses into slightly smaller amounts to try to help cope with the anxiety that comes with the withdrawals without it causing vyvanse withdrawals. I take 60 mg for vyvanse and am trying to cut the dose by roughly 1/3rd so that I’d be taking around 40mg. Sooner or later I’m hoping to ask my doctor to just lower the dose to 40 mg so that I won’t have to keep cutting it manually. He knows about my phenibut addiction and is willing to help, and before I got on phenibut he actually suggested that I should take less vyvanse if I’m experiencing chronic anxiety so I’m sure he’d be on board. God I can’t wait to get off this stuff",7

I was keeping a super clean diet for the last two days, lots of veggies, smoothies, healthy meals, took some probiotics, a lot of l-theanine, omega-3s, magnesium, potasium and stuff like that.

Also recieved a lot of love from my girlfriend which helped a lot (she prepared most of the food, made me a hot bath etc.)

Today I went to sauna with her, did 3x super hot saunas for 10 minutes with cold showers in between.

Came back home feeling bad, ate some duck with veggies, went to bed with some positive thinking book and...

Suddenly I feel awesome. Maybe not 10/10 in term of focus, but generally happy.
