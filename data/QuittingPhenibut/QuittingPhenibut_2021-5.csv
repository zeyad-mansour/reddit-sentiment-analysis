I have a bottle of trazadone, some pregabalin and some muscle relaxers and kratom along with a bunch of otc supplements. I dont have the money to order more for an actual taper, im planning to just make what i have last, like a gram a day or so until its gone.

Ive been on it for about 2 months, went through something like 200-300 grams. Im really sick of this shit and I cant avoid a ct at this point, any advice would be appreciated. Im mostly just scared about fucking up this new job, i hope with what i have i can function well enough to do the job while going through this.

The second to last week of using it I went on a binge of more than one gram per day.

As the title states, I had my last dose of Phenibut over 24 hours ago. I abused it daily for a little over one month although, thankfully, the dosages were always kept pretty low (250mg-1gram.) Starting on the 15th I went on a six day long binge where I took 1g-1.75 g per day. I didn't even do it because it was fun. I fell into the trap of taking more to avoid the horrific withdrawals I figured were coming. Again though, thankfully, 1.75g was the most I have did in a 24 hour span during this period.

On the 21st I took 750mg, 22th: 500mg, 23rd: 500mg, 24: 500mg, 25: 750mg (screwed up and took an extra), 26: 250mg, 27: 250mg, 28: 0.

As the title states this is day one of me being clean. I am having horrific anxiety and night terrors. Body is shaking, feel hopeless, impending doom, flashes out of color and weird visual distortions. No seizures or full blown hallucinations though.

I just wanted to ask everyone here do you suspect I am out of the danger zone in terms of seizures and psychosis? I know I tapered very quickly but the Phenibut itself started making me feeling terrible and I just wanted off of it. Plus, and many other people here were saying this, they told me I was prolonging the withdrawals by continuing to take such small doses. I swear to God I would start taking it and feel worse. I'm in no danger of dying or completely losing it am I?

Also, the only thing I have on hand are a bunch of benzos, Klonopin and Ativan. I will admit I have been taking them and so far they are a life saver. I would not have made it through this without them. They don't cause the symptoms to go away but they allow me to ride through them. The night terrors are the worst. I fell asleep for an hour last night and woke up in a panic attack feeling I was dying. Took 1mg of Ativan and was back asleep in half an hour.

Also, would it be worth it to call my psychiatrist and have him prescribe me bacloffen or gabapentin? He will be pissed at me because I already had one drug scare with amphetamines before but I have heard both of those really help. The hospital I went to two days ago only gave me one Bacloffen pill and my regular caretaker and urgent care both turned me down from offering a prescription.

Sorry for writing so much but I am just very curious about a lot of things. When can I expect the withdrawals to hit their peak? Am I in any danger of psychosis or seizures? And should I ask my psychiatrist for Gabapentin or Bacloffen or just ride through it?

Sorry for being so annoying, but I would heavily appreciate any advice that could be given. Again, its been 24 hours so the WDs have set in, but I know it is usually 48 hours when the true hell breaks loose.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9988884329795837}"

Like I feel I'm back to base and have little to no social anxiety or withdrawal symptoms, mainly due to me not abusing it. The only single symptom I would say I have is insomnia. 

I visited my PCP and he put me on trazodone. The first night I tried it, all it did was make my cock super hard and it made it super uncomfortable for me to sleep. I slept about 5 hours and woke up with the worst headache and felt slightly anxious. I called my doc up and he decided to put me on Lunesta.

My main concern is that I'm trying to completely avoid any gabaergics so my gaba receptors can heal and my tolerance can go down. Does anyone know if taking Lunesta will effect that?

I'm at the point now where anytime I take Phenibut I just get this very gross, eerie, dissociative feeling. It kind of feelings like being in a fever dream. There is no euphoria at all anymore. In fact I would say at this point it is dysphoric. Aside from just the dissociation (which I find has a very disturbing and almost creepy feeling to it that I can't explain) it just feels gross. Dizzy, wobbling, heavy body load, headache. And oddly enough now it even gives me paradoxical effects. I almost get more anxious when I take it.

Starting on the 15th though I made the very dumb decision to go on a binge for six days. From the 15th to the 20th I used 1gram-1.5gpd. I made the dumb decision of getting caught in a very bad panic attack/rebound anxiety on the third day which made me keep going.

Tomrrow, I plan on dropping to 250mg. Ironically taking the Phenibut doesn't really seem to help, I literally feel like my body is telling me no more. I am feeling terrible right now and I just had my last dose of 250mg not even three hours ago.

I won't lie though, it has been rough. No seizures, hallucinations, psychosis or panic attacks, but I have had severe constant anxiety, depression, all the other symptoms, etc. Any advice? Should I just go ahead and jump ship?

As much as it sucks it is bearable. So long as I don't have any seizures, psychosis or severe panic attacks I think I can handle this. I just need to make it a mission not to go back up to 750mg for today. Not sure why but I have a feeling it wouldn't even help.

I have used 4 grams 3 times in one week before and have had no real horrible rebounds, but I’m not sure what to expect this time since I was closer to 5gs for every other day last week. Any help would be appreciated greatly as to what I’m about to go through.

Edit: my first time using phenibut pills instead of powder that I would weigh myself and I made a mistake in calculation. I now realize I was actually using around 6 grams 4 times in the last week when my usual dose was more like 4g. I’m shocked and upset that I didn’t pay more attention to this. Creating my own powder capsules actually helped me stay a lot more responsible with my use.",2,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9950571060180664}"

Please read it, it is now about 80 hours since my last dose, and I'm on day 5 of kratom CT.

I've been averaging 1-2 hours of sleep per night except one day I miraculously got 7ish hours. My heart rate bounces between 100ish and 80ish. This insomnia is the absolute worst, I think I've been up for 2 whole days with an hour of sleep.

I have access to a bottle of lyrica 75mg and a single valium. I'm afraid to take the lyrica because of the cross tolerance, and I also don't want to get hooked on it.

So I have some questions.. what do I do? Just stick it out? Dose low to sleep? (would dosing low fuck my CT and extend withdrawal? also since I was taking it every 3rd day I don't want to get into a daily habit.) Take a lyrica 75mg? (Wouldn't lyrica also extend my withdrawals?) Take the valium, even though I only have one and may need it later?

I'm kinda at the end of my rope with sleeplessness.

This is a great community and the posts here have given me a lot of helpful info. I've decided to finally post myself to hopefully get some more specific advice. I've been on & off phenibut for a few years now, having picked it up after quitting drinking due to health issues. This most recent time, I had been taking 700mg - 1g of lyrica daily for a couple months, and replaced that with phenibut when I ran out. I've been on the pheni every day for a couple months now. I've tapered to 1.5g twice daily, taking 1g of agmatine with each dose to help. Dropping further is giving me difficulties.

I just got a bit of bromazolam. Right now my plan is to stop phenibut entirely, and maintenance dose bromaz for just the first few days to ease w/ds. I'll be getting rid of whatever amount is left after that to be careful (I'm tired of trading one substance for another). I'm also holding onto 600mg of lyrica for an emergency. I work 4 days a week (which has hindered my attempts to taper), so I think I'm going to do the first few days off phenibut (with bromaz) on my days off, then use the lyrica to help get through those first days back at work, if needed. I'm wary about continuing agmatine while on bromazolam, but will resume taking it when I use the lyrica and beyond that (to help regulate glutamate and whatnot).

I've read lots of advice on this channel and established a tapering routine that consists of decreasing the amount by 20 percent each week. But now the withdrawals start hitting harder and since they are kind of changing their shape and effects, I now felt the urge to ask for your advice. Please feel free to move this thread onto another section and please excuse, if I posted it wrong, since I'm new to reddit.

I started using phenibut in September 2020 to overcome a gbl/ghb addiction and sleep withdrawal, that I slipped into after a horrible breakup in July 2020. I used gbl/ghb in the afternoon till early morning and switched over to phenibut after my last daily dose of gbl/ghb began losing it's effect, in order to catch some sleep. This worked well and I went off both for 2 weeks completely in October. Foolishly I couldn't handle the following depression and started using both again in November. The dosages then increased up to 2gpd and 2,5ml/2h. As I hit this mark in January 2021, I finally quit the gbl/ghb and switched to 1g at noon and 2g of phenibut at night. I decreased my noon dose to zero within 2 weeks and by the beginning of March, I was down to 1g per evening and tapered that down to zero as well, within one week.

3 days after this last dose I went to bed and took a few hits of cannabis, as I always would, but that night something went off terribly, which I believe was a severe withdrawal syndrome with a 4h hell ride of seizures, tremor, heartrace, horrible anxiety and sudden doom delusions, triggered by the dopamine rush/ gaba block that (as I later read) can be caused by thc.

I took 1.2g of pheni that night and the withdrawals subsided within 2-4 hours. Since then, I slowly tapered down to now 250mg every night, but seem to be stuck on that level. I tried going down to 230mg the other day, which was followed by mild tremor, seizures and anxiety the following day. So I took my dose a little earlier than usual and upped it back to 250mg. Problem is, I still feel like shit and get haunted by bad nightmares with little to no sleep, pains in arms, back and chest, heart palpitations, fatigue, headache/dizziness and loss of appetite since then. Before that, I had little withdrawal symptoms only and was convinced in the success of my taper, but now I somehow lose hope.

Due to the struggle I'm in, I completely gave up caffein and cannabis, which were stable fellows to me during my 20ies, for that whole period. I'm 30yo now, live in europe and could get some pregabalin (lyrica) or diazepam (valium) next week. The usual supplements like magnesium, chamomile tea are in my stack already. I do have valerian root extract as well, but got really dizzy from it.

I started taking phenibut 3.5 years ago and did a good job for a year and a half of keeping it to no more than 2 times a week. I relapsed on alcohol and for a year was hammered practically all of last year. When I quit drinking, I started leaning on Phenibut more and more. I'd take it three days in a row and then take 2-3 days off and then go back into it. Tolerance spiked and I was getting to 4 gpd and before I knew it I was starting to take it daily. I rarely top out at more than 4 gpd so thats been kinda my max for the last month. I'm ready to quit. I have a prescription for gabapentin that was supposed to be for sleep. I should be able to get 90 in a about a week or so, so that's when I will begin my big push to 0. Here's my plan:

I will follow the subs normal taper plan of dropping 100mgs max a day. I will add gabapentin as needed to ease the WDs that I noticed I was getting in my first attempt. I plan on adding more gabapentin the further I drop my dose. I want to maybe take one a day in the early phase and then drop some and take two and then eventually get to the point where Im taking 4 or so and hopefully by the time I'm off phenibut I will be at 5 or so gabapentin and then do a taper from that. has anyone tried this? should I not switch myself to gabapentin and just be done with both? It's my understanding that gabapentin is more forgiving than phenibut.

I also was curious about how severe you might think my WDs will be considering that I had no real physical withdrawals from alcohol despite drinking about a fifth (or more) a day for months on end. It was a breeze for me after day 3 or so.

I even prepared separate dishes for both newbies and pathological nlogs to resist the temptation of a nice, clickey poll 💋👩‍🍳💁🏻‍♀️

&nbsp;

**ABOUT THE [USAGE PATTERN] CHOICES**

&nbsp;

*---[Large Dose/Once]---*

You take a comparatively huge quantity but only do so during one short period every 24 hours. For a lot of you, you just do one massive dose each morning, so pick this one! 

Depending what your *actual* gram per dose is here, something else infrequent yet massively lopsided like.. 9.5 grams every 12 hours should also be registered here. 

&nbsp;

*---[SmMed Dose / Multi&Spaced]---* 

You take slightly more reasonable amounts, same ballpark in size, and space them throughout the day 

&nbsp;

**ABOUT THE 'BIOGRAPHICAL FACT,' CHOICES**

It's pretty straightforward — choose ""Medical/Behavioral Yikes"" if you've ever, under any circumstances, taken phenibut in such an obscene or irresponsible manner or with such depraved indifference to yourself, your property, or others, that you are pretty certain you became an overdose, hospital visit, psychiatric hold, progenitor or genuine crime, severe injury, reckless behavior in contravention of even your£ *own* moral code, etc. 

It's the kind of experience that you will have no doubts about having had if you've had it.

Following from that ⬆️ logic, then, if nothing stands out, then nothing's there, and select ""health-ish.""

&nbsp;

*And remember: make sure you choose the option that matches both facts about you **if you're allowed to touch such options.*

&nbsp;

Everyone else, sort yourselves out in the remaining two choices ❤️💕

&nbsp;

I've noticed after years of being in this sub a very distinct pattern among all of us bona fide phenibut-dependants that has a clear separation between groups whose members seems to never, ever switch to and from the other pattern..

&nbsp;

the inverse {Size :: Frequency} intake pattern, 

&nbsp; 

and I have a suspicion that I want to get data on (sure, it'll be crappy & unreliable, but still, data!) about this small but significant choice..

(Tapering),"I started taking phenibut in November of last year (2020) and even though I knew I could get addicted I fell in love with it and IMMEDIATELY began taking 1-3 gpd. 

Wow was my life wonderful. I contacted old friends I hadn’t spoken to in 10 or 20 years, I began talking to my father again, I was so outgoing, all because of the phenibut. 

My wife was pregnant and gave birth December 27 to a 9 pound little girl. My experience at the hospital, going through birth and everything was just beyond anything I’d ever experienced. The Phen took any anxiety away and made the whole thing much easier for me to handle without being intoxicated like a benzo or something. 

Anyway 6 weeks ago I was up to taking 3-4 grams a day and not noticing any effects. 

I knew I was hooked. 

This sucks. (For instance, back in February I was waiting for my phenibut to be delivered - there was a snow storm and the fed ex guy couldn’t park on my street so he just left. I was out. The next day same thing but I was waiting for him. I ran after the fed ex truck down 3 snowy Brooklyn blocks and finally caught up with him and got my package.)

Anyway my wife realized I was taking an addictive substance and was like hell no. I’m already on suboxone, don’t need another drug addiction. So she took my whole stash and has been dutifully tapering me, keeping the supply in a lock box. 

I went from 2gpd down to now 600mg per day. I struggled around the 1gram per day drop to 750mg but now I’m feeling ok. 

My question: is the hardest part at the end? Will getting from 600mg p/d to zero but very painful compared to the rest? I also have a gabapentin prescription. Any advice on how slow to go?

Anyway back in Janruary 2021 I got on again and my dose went up very quickly very fast, I got hooked on gabapentin too and im back to being a full blown addict

A couple days ago my scale broke so I have been eyeballing my doses but I've been making sure they are high because I don't want to dose to low and get the shakes while working, So last night I could not sleep so I took a 3rd dose of the day probably around 10 grams and then about an hour or two later I started getting eye wiggles, shaking and my body temperature kept getting really hot then my vision in my right eye completely went away and the vision in my left eye was reduced to a small circle but there was lights around the circle as if I was looking at the sun

Eventually I started freaking out and dozing off for minutes or seconds at a time waking up extremely covered in sweat, I decided to try to get help but when reaching for my phone I pass out again, eventually I crawled into bed and was able to sleep for the rest of the night. I woke up feeling extra shitty feeling withdrawls. Enough is enough its time to get off this stuff for good, no matter how magical it used to be once apon a time.

I ordered a scale and im ready to taper (cold turkey last time my body could not adjust and I didnt sleep for 7 months after) I will try to scale as quickly as possible while being able to still work (I need this job for the health insurance) Sorry about terrible grammar / formatting im still shaking and don't know what to make of this.

When taking too much I get GABA overdose and get thrown down to the floor so hard I hurt my head, I fell asleep standing, can´t speak, slur and vomit.

When talking to little I get in the land of primal fear and get paranoid psychosis and end up in the psychiatric clinic for a couple of weeks. And I tried to taper a million times but the WD state never ends. I get chills, feels like my spine is replaced by ice, I vomit and can´t eat or sleep and have tremors. I went on like this for six months but relapsed on 1,3 gram, I just couldn't take it anymore after losing 15kg.

From what I read and understand, I took a class in biological psychology, my brain is overflooded with glutamate, and GABA receptors are all burned out. So I need something that suppresses glutamate. It stresses out my brain and causes severe anxiety which causes me to cascade vomit.

I just wanted to share I was on Suboxone for Kratom withdrawals by myself long story and I was taking a bunch of supplements but I dropped all of them pretty much except for a select few. I started that 1.5 mg once a day for like half a month and then  one milligram once a day for like half a month. Than I started to drop so I went from .75 to .5. I also got addicted to phenibut during that time. 
I was down to .5 and in hell. The phenibut was helping and I a@lo had pregabalin and gabapentin. I hated the burp and hated dosing so when my wd started I was craving something I hate to begin with. Quite the experience.
Life was hard and I wasn't at home for 2 days during drop.. Dude hits me up 4.5 grams shrooms 45 dollars....MINE

My Significant other who was also doing this but she got hook on the burp itself. She was having paranoia on top of my wd. Had to get out. Anyway I 1 got the shrooms went home as she calm down and take him something to relax. I offer the shrooms she has no interest. I take two grams at 10:00 empty stomach. I feel happy but my whole. body hurts as I peek very little visuals at all but the closed eye visuals are like shooting lights and colors something I never seen before. At 12 I ate the other two grams thinking well it's going to help with the WD possibly I'd seen a couple things about microdosing. Then the mushroom started to kick in more and I went on my way just screwing around listening to music smoking weed excetera but weak trip I thought it's the burp, so I came down ate and took a clonidine (forgot to mention .1ug few times a day) and actually fell asleep deeper then I had in months. 

I wake up at six I take my dose at 6:30 a.m.. I got distracted by some more really bad family drama. But I don't have a panic attack like I had  when I got a little flustered when in Wd, bit sweaty but didnt feel like the burp, more like when I miss my phenibut.Than then two hours past I didn't realize I didn't take my burp dose or in the phenibut. It's now been over 48 hours with no burp or phenibut. 

I'm excited but scared at the same time. I'm worried that withdrawals will come back for both of them in a few days I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this and I know everyone's body is different but maybe that worked similar to ibogane?
I hesitate to to post this because it seems similar to like a medicated detox cuz I don't want to give people the impression that it works so go ahead and take opiates all you want and then take 4 grams and you're good to go. plus because I mean even though I felt good for a little while the whole experience wasn't exactly pleasurable but I do kind of feel like I'm about 5 lb lighter my skin is getting better my body looks like it's healing.",4,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9978160858154297}"

In the last 3 months I got into a pattern of using it daily at increasingly high dosages, taking 1 or 2 weeks off and doing it again. At the end of my last binge I was so sedated that I barely managed to get myself to the bed in order to fall onto it. Next morning, I decided to quit it for good, thinking that as usual, I would handle the withdrawals decently by doing heavy exercise, quitting caffeine and keeping generally active, while having a last taper dose for the next night. I went on, ran a 4k, did my exercise routine, did some breathing sessions, took my last dose for bed.

Although I gradually discovered that I wouldn't sleep that night, I felt electrified and couldn't relax. I would feel my eyes contract and shiver when I closed them, soon enough, flashes would come,  pictures of evil looking creatures in dim-lighted rooms with a sickening grin on their faces, I would hear a slow, disturbing chant, looping whenever I got up to try to do something to keep my mind off what would soon become long lasting hallucinations.

I was not freaking out yet though, I assumed it would subside the next day, and wasn't too annoyed doing an all-nighter. I resumed my activities the next day, went to work, did everything I had to do and didn't really feel anxiety through it all.

The thing is, as evening came I started to feel electrified and anxious again, like I did the previous night. I tried a hot bath, herbal tea, breathing techniques. Everything failed.

I would close my eyes and be forced to watch what seemed to be an endless and insane succession of images, sometimes movie clips in very high resolution. I had never experienced visualisations as intense as those. I felt trapped. The next 24 hours is a blur, I only remember somewhat alternating between witnessing those closed-eyed hallucinations, having a panic attack and crawling to a corner, I managed to sleep out of exhaustion after what must have been more than 48 hours awake, for 8 hours.

The next day I woke up with terrible anxiety, convinced that I would go into psychosis, I had this intense fear that I irreversibly damaged a part of my brain needed for normal sleep with all the glutamate storms I felt rushing through my ears during the last 2 weeks. I stayed up for 38 hours this time, and went through soul crushing delusions, I felt I had lost all control over myself and all sense of identity. I even got on my knees and prayed god to spare me, and promised to change everything for the better if he would (I am not religious by any stretch of the imagination).

The next day I managed to sleep normally without any sort of hallucinations, and that brings us to today. Feeling depressed like I never felt before, wounded and ashamed like a petty creature some villagers threw to the bottom of a well, atleast there's light above instead of plain darkness now. Don't know how I will reach it.

So yes. Tapering is wise, and never touching this ever or again is even wiser.

I suspect I experienced something akin to the kindling effect. Because I've never had withdrawals nearly as brutal from phenibut (or anything else, really). If you're playing around like I did, going on weekly binges and going through withdrawals frequently, thinking you're the special kind of cat that will never experience anything too disagreeable from this substance: watch the hell out, because it's coming.",14,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9981834292411804}"

Road to being human again.,"Well it started a little over a year ago where a stressful event made my once a week phenibut habit turn to daily use. Started with 3GS and within a few months I was at 8gs, few months later 10, then 16 and about two months ago was at a peak of 18gs. 


(March 30th)

At around 18gs I began to experience glutamate storms. Honestly at first I thought I was going insane, panic attacks and derealisation. Thanks to research on this subreddit, I found out this was most definitely caused by too high of a dose and was issues with glutamate. I quickly tapered down to 12gs with in a week. Things definitely felt better at 12gs but I still felt really weird. I stayed at 12gs hoping things would stabilize but they never did and soon anxiety and derealization came creeping back. I decided to drop again to 9gs a day, 6 in morning 3 in the evening. 

(May 4th)

At 9gs a day anxiety and to an extent derealization got a lot better. It’s been about two weeks. Now that the anxiety has been cut out I now have a new symptom, pretty bad depression.   I have very little energy and pretty bad anhedonia.  

I just don’t know where to go from here. I just want to feel alive again. The day to day has become a really grueling struggle. 

Should I wait at 9gs for depression to improve? I’d like to continue tapering but if it will make it feel worse I really don’t know if I could handle it.

Could anyone reccomend supplements  to help with these symptoms as well? Particularly with anhedonia and depression. 
I am also taking agmatine 1g with each am and pm dosage. Also will at NAC soon.

For the past 7-8 months I’ve pretty much been a daily user between 1,200-1,800mg. I’ll very rarely go above 2g.

The past couple months my anxiety has noticeably increased along with a decrease in motivation at work and socially. 

A couple weeks ago, I had a day or two where I didn’t take any because I simply forgot. During those days, I felt way more talkative, sociable and motivated. Tried this again this past week and the same thing happened.

I’m now on day 4 of not taking Phenibut and I feel so much better. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I realize I’m supposed to taper and I DO NOT suggest cold turkey however I’ve been taking Phenibut for years and I rarely get a strong rebound anxiety. 

I’m confused why going off Phenibut would cause me to have LESS anxiety…I’ve always loved it and it has helped me through so much so I’m wondering if this could just be a side effect of it or if it might be placebo. I’ve been wanting to quit all together so I’m really happy I found this sub :)

 I took like 5 of them totally responsibly.  I thought I'd be good.  Holy fucking shit the rebound was the worst time of my life.  It started out slowly with me thinking I was bipolar.  Then it got fucking terrible.   I had tremors, brain zaps when I tried to sleep and hours upon hours of thinking I fried my brain.  I had no idea that would happen. Terrible nightmares.  I legitimately thought other people were talking shit about me all the time and I felt depressed from that.

I got psychosis eventually, becoming uncomfortably attracted to people on TV and getting freaked out by their teeth.  My eyes were red and beady.  I was shaky as fuck and couldn't hold a conversation with anyone but my mom as she patted my back and comforted me in bed.  I wanted to die so bad and she's only reason I'm alive.

Help please,"Okay okay okay so I know I'm dumb I'm an idiot and everything I'm about to say will make me feel stupid but here I go. I'm currently taking less than a milligram of Suboxone to try to quit kratom over 5 years habit of over 24 grams a day. Successfully did this in about three weeks back in January I also quit drinking at the same time but slipped up on the Kratom and was back to very low dose but didn't realize I didn't need Suboxone again to stop. Fast forward about a month and a half I decided to try phenibut  (knowing full well what could happen but thinking I'm superman). I also take 600 mg of Gabapentin 3 times a day prescribed 300 3times a day but have ways of getting more, I and I also take lion's mane and ashwagandha and augmatine ( 1000 mg agmatine 3 times a day, 1 gram of lions mane 2x a day and 1 gram of ashwagandha in 2 doses, oh and I have also been taking emoxypine 160mg 3 times a day for about a month. And unfortunately the backwards friend who had me use Suboxone for kratom the second time around also recommended the phenibut.  

Fast forward two weeks later from that and I'm taking 600 mg of phenibut three times a day on top of the Gabapentin. I'm still taking the Suboxone and want to start tapering for their down but don't want to go through both of those withdrawals at the same time if I do experience withdrawals from the phenibut. 

From what I understand Gabapentin is stronger than phenibut so I guess my question is theoretically would I be able to just stop taking pheni and replace it with the Gabapentin or would I still taper the phenibut down over the course of a couple days to none? Like tomorrow take 400mg am, 300mg mid day and then 400mg evening or possibly cut out 2nd dose with same size  . Then following day take  lower while remaining on gabapentin for like 3 days till no more pheni?  Once I know I'm safely out of the pheni I'm going to drop my Suboxone dose by .25 while remaining on the lion's mane ashwagandha Agmatine and emoxypine( which I was going to cycle soon but will put off maybe even longer to help with tapering drops for suboxone) and gabapentin I'm scared I don't enjoy the Suboxone on at all which I think will help me a knock that but the pheni and the Gabby obviously.

Also I've been on 1200 mg of Gabapentin 3 times a in the past for quite a while and stopping abruptly. I know I felt funny for a day or two afterward but since I always have crippling anxiety and depression maybe that'll help with some of these transitions? I'm also supposed to be taking Wellbutrin 150 mg and I think I might start taking them again.

One other quick question, would phenylpiractame is something I could substitute for the normal piracetam to help me be I've heard that that can help with tolerance maybe that would be something that would be beneficial right now? I also plan on stopping piracetam  and finding something more natural sometime in the near future.

Life feels normal again for the most part. The withdrawal for phenibut was very weird, it is such a long acting drug and messes with your brain a ton. There were some days I felt terrible and others I felt better. Honestly I had brain fog for about like a month and then it just went away. I used phenibut for 3 months before doing a fast taper which lasted around 8 days. Before I had a scale I would just take spoonfuls of it so I’m not sure what the dosage was, but I’m sure some days were around like 6g.

So first, shortly about me. 31 male, I have bipolar disorder and I am on 200mg lamotrigine. Yesterday was last dose of 10mg escitalopram as doctor recommended. I hit the gym few times a week. Everything is fine with that.
 I get addicted to phenibut again. First time I did ColdTurkey and will never do it again. This is hell!

I read the REDDIT stuff about cutting 50-100mg everyday but is it really that slow neccessary? Or at least If I go that way will the WD be calmer?

Now about my taper:
I was on 10g of Phenibut for about a month. 
1st week of taper I was on 9g and it was OK
2nd week I did 8g and still it was not bad
3rd weeks began and:

Yesterday I did 7g in the morning and later the evening was like "" Everything is grey, something bad is gonna happen"". I took my last 1mg of clonazepam and went to sleep.
When I wake up I still felt like shit. So after I took 4,6g in the morning it is still shitty but I can just live a day, went to the gym.
Feel little less shitty but I am afraid the night.
I am going to take 2,4g near evening.

Is it really better to split dose during the day when taper?
I ask because if this shit happens today as yesterday I will call my doctor and tell him about phenibut maybe he prescribe gabapentin or something?
Right now I dont even want to think about work which I like. Dont want to watch Netflix even. The best would be take benzos and sleep all the time but... its definately worst option. Also dont have any benzos and dont want it.

about two weeks ago I started tapering again and went from 3gpd-1.7. The first day I dropped from 3-2.5 with minor withdrawal. Over the next few from 2.5-1.7.

About 5 days ago I was on 1.7. The withdrawals had only started getting unberable at 1.7, so I decided to stabalize.

Over the next few days, it just got worse and worse. 2 days ago I couldn’t take it and upped my dose to 2.2.

Yet it continued to get worse yesterday, and  last night. This morning was about the same and I suddenly started feeling better about two hours ago.

Fasoracetam, l-theanine, ashwaganda, passionflower, rhodiola, melatonin, magnesium, as well arriving today -beta-alanine, agmatine, and taurine.

As well, I have (10)-1mg tabs of clonazapam. I thought I would cut these in half and use to sleep, keeping my benzo use under a week. and that the phen would works it's way out by then. Not sure now if they work on the same receptors though, and if rebound would be worse at that time.

My other thought is that I have plenty of 500 and 250 tabs Phen on hand and perhaps I should go back to 1g or 500g and taper slowly over a week or so, instead of using the benzo. My work is demanding this week and I'm already sleep deprived. My brain is kinda mush right now as I type.  I had a small panic attack yesterday even though I felt good.

So I have been taking phen on and off for the last two years with my high end being 2.5gpd. My method has been consistently going from my high dose for 2-3 days then cutting it in half for two or three days, then to down to a gram for two or three days, then down to half a gram and so on until I do a day with none or just coast on half a gram / quarter gram for a few days, and then back up to my high dose.   
I see people saying they are going through terrible WD when cutting down from 3ish grams to half a gram around the same timeline as I do if not longer. Yet the worst I feel is perhaps more irritable on my low dose / no dose days.   


Anyone shed some light as to why I do not feel the terrible symptoms as described on this sub?

Prescribed: Venlafaxine 150mg (kicked up to 225mg recently)  


Sups:   
Lion's mane extract water & alcohol   
Magnesium Glycinate 600mg  
Alpha GPC  
Vitamin D

2021-05-09 04:57:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/n8ac1j/my_experience_recommendations/,My Experience & Recommendations,"I have quite a bit of experience with the use of Phenibut and subsequently withdrawing and thought I might make a post sharing what I've learned as it could probably really help people who are suffering, I initially started using it as a means to treat anxiety, the symptoms of which are mainly physical, muscle tightness etc... Dosing for me would never go over 2 gram a day, and would usually range from 400mg - 1 gram a day. These same measures can also be applied for alcohol withdrawal:

Effective tips and methods of 'quitting phenibut':

+ Of course, tapering, especially at doses at 800mg and more. This reduces the possibility of the' kindling effect' on our gabaergic system and reduces the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Simply lowering dosage by 100mg every other day, would be a good taper; this can be achieved with use of a mg sensitive weighing scale available on amazon.

+ Along with the taper, there are a number of supplemental measures you can take (ordered from most helpful to least helpful imo): 
            
            - N, acetylcysteine (taken in the morning as its somewhat stimulating, at least for me) is especially good for phenibut withdrawal, whether going on a taper or cold turkey, it raises levels of glutathiones in the brain which regulate glutamatergic activity, the shakiness feeling in your chest and or limbs you may get during phenibut withdrawal, is accountable to excitatory glutamate overactivity. NAC has yielded promising results for a range of addictions, and psychiatric conditions.
           - Strong chamomile tea, chamomile contains a        compound which raises levels of gaba called Apigenin, I put ~8 bags in a mug and agitate them to get as much out of them as possible during a taper, this will help bring anxiety levels down and of taken in the evening, improve sleep. 
          - L-theanine also helps via the same mechanism.
          - CBD oil, can be useful for some, but not for others, this seems to 'balance things out' via its effect on the endocannabinoid system, it helps you sleep, which brings me to my next point.



+ Don't underestimate the importance of sleep, I would recommend dosing phenibut when on a taper before you sleep, and implementing other measures (no blue light, meditation, turn phone off etc..) to ensure you get a restful sleep. I don't recommend benadryl / nytol because this messes with the most important stage of sleep, REM.

+ I and others have noticed withdrawal is far less severe (and sometimes non existent) on a Ketogenic Diet, this seems to be because one of the ketones the body produces (beta hydroxy butyrate) has a gabaergic effect, it is chemically similar to gaba (gamma aminobutyric acid), it has also been found that more glutamate is converted to gaba while in a state of ketosis. This can be a double edged sword as keto is hard for some to implement and the initial 'keto flu' can be an additional stressor you simply don't need when trying to get off of an addictive substance.

+ Fasoracetam (20mg - 100mg sublingual) seems to help many people, hypothetically due to up regulating gaba-b receptors, but the instantaneous effects people report suggest it's more likely to be the effect it has on regulating glutamate activity which only seems to work in people with specific genetic mutations. This seems to be hit or miss for people and for many, is unaffordable. 

+ Quit coffee / caffeine, while it's a nice combo with phenibut, the last thing you need when you are withdrawing from a gabaergic substance is something which raises glutamate activity and pumps up cortisol and adrenaline. 

+ Adaptogens: Things like Ashwaghanda (KSM-66), Adaptogenic mushrooms and Rhodiola Rosea have helped many. 

+ Not all of the withdrawal effects are related to the glutamate / gaba system, Phenibut also has downstream dopaminergic effects (hence the euphoria) and the lack of motivation, drive etc.. When withdrawing. This will get better with time and the brain has a remarkable capacity to balance and heal, don't feel pressured to make big decisions, take on extra responsibilities etc. While withdrawing, preferably, you'd want to allocate a period of rest and put your life on hold for the withdrawal period. It will subside, just remember how you feel now does not translate to how you will feel in future, and you have all the capacity to forge a brighter future for yourself. 

+ Using the above measures, it should make withdrawal a much easier ordeal, withdrawal time will depend on a number of factors including the dosage, length of period taking phenibut, and individual variability. Personally, I feel normal after 1-2 weeks minimum using the aforementioned measures after tapering over a week to 400mg from ~ 1 gram daily for months and going cold turkey from 400mg (no doubt, tapering even further to lower amounts woild be more advisable). 

+ After withdrawal subsides reflect on why you choose to turn to exogenous substances for comfort, and work to improve your life, diet, situation and environment so you begin to feel more content and comfortable in your own skin naturally. 

I really hope this helps somebody, any queries, criticisms - I'd be happy to address.

Edit: Also would recommend a multivitamin, I was having a range of weird side effects while taking phenibut regularly, like hearing vibrations at night, thought I was hearing 'the hum' and random pains deep in my bones, these subsided once I took a good quality multivitamin.

Right before april started I bought 100 grams of phenibut. I knew about it already and loved gabapentin, remembered this was supposed to be similar. I was going pretty slow with it for maybe 1.5 weeks, then me and my friends did meth. The crash was really hard, and i realized I could get high from this shit a little under a week later. 
I never measured my doses but at this point we were just scooping it with spoons. It made me exactly who I wanted to be I was so happy and confident all the issues went away. Went on a pretty hard vender for the rest of the month, probably like 3-8 grams a day usually between a few redoses. I thought all my problems were fixed I didnt realize it was the drug. We, but almost entirely just me, went through a 100 gram container and I have the last little bit of a 200 gram container left.
On may 1st we started a roadtrip across the country, I didnt dose again after the first. 2 or 3 days later we were in Georgia and I was on some tramadol, we popped an addy and we went all night. After the sun rose I was hallucinating all day which ended in a panic attack and full blown psychosis, I kept texting my frens thinking the adderall was meth cus why else would i be in psychosis. I figured out what was happening and almost went to the ER but i took more phenibut and chilled out.
I figured out 2.5g a day once a day is enough to keep me normal but not high, the mental addiction is crazy I want to be that person so bad I want that person back so bad i just need to eat a bunch of the silly dietary supplement to get it back, yknow?
I took 2 grams in alabama and just felt derealized all day, it was awful. Ive been dosing 2-3.5 grams a day since and its keeping me stable, got a bunch of vitamins in preparation to taper, but this timing is so fucking bad I want to be functional during this roadtrip to do my part and then we end in Montana and i start a new job.
Just had to get this out there, any tips or tricks? Getting prescriptions to help is out of the question, and after the psychosis im so scared to just stop though im sure doing the Adderall is what flung me into that state.

6:15-coffe+agmatine+pre w/o and 6G Kratom. Gym time with my so . Went well, good endorphin rush

8:45- 2 ml 2M2B (first time taking it) taste like straight gasoline but feel a familiar alcohol type warmth cone over me. I’m taking this strictly to mitigate Phenibut withdrawals.

8:50- onset of “intoxication” it’s an odd feeling of alcohol without the negative sides like nausea or dizziness, just lowered stress. Typically by this time without Phenibut I’d be irritated at every little thing but I’m ok today

9:30- watch a movie with the wife, feel myself sinking into the couch, intense sedation or “body high” I still feel sharp

10:45- 2ml more 2M2B lay down with my wife and talk

1:30- 6G Kratom play some super smash brothers with my son, got a few laughs, something that would NEVER happen if I felt Phenibut WDs

Now- writing this out feeling OK. Gotta say I’m surprised that 2M2B has worked this well. I AM intoxicated, I feel I can’t take this for work but on days when I’m doing chores or  hanging with family I feel it’s a good break from WDs

I have been taking Phenibut consistently for over 3 years. I started at the usual starting dose of 500mg but over the years the dosage has increased to 3.1g every 2-3 days. I've attempted to quit several times over the years but without success. My biggest concern for quitting has always been that once I'm off, my ""Off days"" will be my every day and I feel as if that will cause me a lot of mental/emotional issues. 

A little backstory. I have always had problems with ADD/ADHD since I was very young (Example having a ""behavioral book"" in grade 2 and depending on how I behaved, I would be allotted a specific amount of time on my computer to play games). Every report card from grade 1 to 10 including comments from teachers indicating that I was very bright but lacked the attention to thrive. After grade 10 I was sent to an alternate highschool where I would take one course at a time which allowed me to focus on one single subject. Fast forward to College where I took Game Development. I managed to sneak my way through the 3 year course where I barely squeaked by but did obtain my Advanced diploma. Now fast forward to today... I am 6 days away from 30. I am currently a software developer in test (Automation tester) and I was having a very hard time with focussing on coding for 8 hours a day every day. I've finally decided to discuss my issues with my GP. (To be clear I did get tested at 17 and was diagnosed with ADHD but was against the idea of medication). I have just started my first dose of Vyvanse (Canadian Adderall) and my outlook of my future seems clear.

All this rambling has a point. Though this prescription is brand new, I feel like I can finally take the steps required to quit phenibut and get on with my life. Phenibut really helped with a period where I didn't feel like I could progress professionally at my workplace or progress as an individual in every day life. Realistically Phenibut for me was a failed attempt at trying to better my quality of life and I understand now that this Russian Cosmonaut anxiolytic was not the answer. If you are having a hard time with quitting, need some boost of confidence or some push to help, if you have access to a GP or some resource to get diagnosed, speaking to a doctor may be your best first step. 

TLDR: Vyvanse is helping my outlook on life and I feel will assist in my ability to finally quit.

Dosage of Vyvanse so far is currently 30mg dose once in the morning. Effects are supposed to last for 10-14 hours.

Honestly the fact that I even wrote this entire post is blowing my mind. Generally I would stop due to assuming people wouldn't care or I would get distracts and walk away from writing/close my tab without realizing. 

Feel free to ask any questions about my experience so far.

Goodluck everyone.",5,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9958764314651489}"

Side note: About 6 months ago, while my dad was sick with cancer, he had horrible, almost chronic hiccups and I noticed that baclofen could be used to treat it. The doctors chose haldol though, I’m guessing because he was on hospice and was also agitated at night :(

The past 2.5 years it’s gone up to 5-7 days on in a row at 3-4gpd followed by 3 days off then the cycle pretty much repeats. 
I have had several multi-week breaks in there and for me, it’s never been too hateful (sleepless nights, shaky, blah).  I know it’s ill advised but I’ll use small amounts of alcohol at night times to help the anxiety but not too much to make everything worse.
Anyway, one thing i finally noticed that was a huuuge help was fasting and only eating small meals.  About 6 months ago I noticed that after eating a full (normal) sized meal that the acute w/d symptoms would get so so bad. The past couple of long breaks have been somewhat fasted for the first week and the anxiety, panic, brain fog and the feelings of being totally disconnected have lessened.
Anyone else ever notice this?  
I am on a long break now. I think as far as wd goes that I am lucky.

Tingling in my nerves top of feet toes and back of palms in near my wrist. Fatigue this one was moderate at times. Extreme agitation, really irritable, my own voice annoyed me. And lastly vivid lucid night terror of the utmost horror. I know have some form of trauma based damage in my mind because I will never forge these dreams.

Staying on 100 mg steadily for around two weeks before just hopping off completely. Phenibut overall has me torn between two worlds. On one hand i feel lucky that when i found this drug i experienced the world like no man has before pure bliss 24/7 then on the other hand i had an equally destructive withdrawal process. Worse than opiates but only half as bad as Benzodiazepines. Let this be a warning to all of you out there abusing this shit. You are nota big boy and I guarantee you my friends.

I’m in the final stage of fairly rapid taper off a 2.5gpd/1.5 year habit. With use of agmatine, fasoracetam,  cbd weed, and Benadryl for sleep, my regimen has involved dropping 250mg every three days until I hit 1 gram. Then I slowed it down to 100mg every three days. I am now on my second day taking zero phenibut, and for the  first time I’m really paralyzed by my rebound depression (which I tend to experience instead of anxiety by disposition). Rebound during dosage drops was very unpleasant but still allowed me to be functional. Given the dosage/length of my habit, how long do you folks think this last paralyzing stage of rebound will last? Im determined to stick it out, I just want some idea of how long I need to put off making long term decisions to avoid letting the WD/rebound depression distort my judgement.",3,{},"{'label': 'NEGATIVE', 'score': 0.9723833203315735}"

I quit kratom a little over 2 months ago, because my body had become highly allergic or something to it over time I started getting SEVERE HELLISH OCD AND PANIC ATTACKS long story but I quit that CT. and that wasn’t too bad honestly. At least I’m not so paranoid and panicky anymore. 

But then, as is common on here I was running out of phenibut and didn’t want to order more. 

I was taking 2G of FAA and, unfortunely I figured out you could snort it, and I would do that whenever I’d get a panic attack and it would help quite a bit. That turned into a daily thing on top of the 2G in the morning id snort 50mg or so in the afternoon. 

Well I got some agmatine and started to taper pretty dang fast about 200mg every 3 days and did eventually level out a bit. But I’m still snorting this crap every day. I’m down to 20mg. 

Well I ran out of agmatine the other day and it’s just been hell. This whole thing has been hell and it’s been like a month and a half. 

I don’t have $ to order anything I’m broke and live in a fn van lol.

2016- took any where from 30-90mg adderall with at least 8mg Xanax also about 8 Vicodin’s a day for 3-4 months then when I got into cocaine it went downhill - I needed up in Jail for a night ( unknowingly called the cops on myself because I was hallucinating that I was being robbed at my home) 

2017 - fresh out of jail and coming off that 4 month binge I googled and found phenibut which is “legal” it was the most amazing thing I’ve encountered that help me completely come off all the other drugs but the high lasted only a few weeks then that turned into ... 5-10 grams per day for 1 year 

2018- drastically cut my dosage in half to 2-3 grams a 
(Started to use Kratom at end of 2018) also quit cigarettes during this time due to my anxiety/hypochondria of thinking I have calling cancer due to trouble breathing from phenibut w/d .
