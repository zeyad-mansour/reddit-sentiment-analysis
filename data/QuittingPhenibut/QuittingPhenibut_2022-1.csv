Been using phenibut since 2019. Never dosed more than 1.5 grams day    


I was at 750mg for about 18 months and dropped to 500mg. Last week I Dropped to 250mg and have been at this dose for a week. 

Should I stabilize at 250mg for a while? Just jump off now? or drop-down to 125mg for a while?

&#x200B;

I have been using very small doses of bromazolam (1mg to 3mg) to help with the mild side effects at night.

I feel like I am so close and right on time.

Both of my main sources have stopped stocking it and are acting as if they have no plans to re-order. 

&#x200B;

On a side note. I have just started using a nootropic called noopept that is absolutely amazing.

I finished my last dose yesterday and can’t order more because of the supply shortage. I’ve been taking ~2gs of ND’s Phenibut HCL capsules for about 3 years straight. After seeing them out of stock I started tapering to 1.25 gs for 3-4 days and felt fine but now I’m definitely experiencing some withdrawals about 24 hrs after my last 750mg dose. I can feel the anxiety, dysphoria, and my feet tingling but since I am aware that these are withdrawal symptoms, I can power through them. I am concerned however of the more serious side effects, and I’m not sure if the concern stems from the anxiety or if I should be seriously worried. Are there any signs that withdrawals are serious and I shouldn’t do this cold turkey? In the past when I’ve quit I powered through it without any symptoms and would prefer to do that if possible",5,0

Recently I’ve been tapering off a habit which was at worst probably 600mg pregabalin (2x 300mg/day) and ~2-3g phenibut (faa). I probably started slowly around June 2021. For reference I’m 30/M, generally pretty physically fit. I am a competitive runner and have engaged in calisthenics for about 0.5 years for fun and exercise.

I have found it to be relatively easy to reduce phenibut, and was at about 0.67gpd when I decided to work on the pregabalin, cutting from 600mg to 300mg. I think I felt ok after one week, but during that time I had one ambulance call and one urgent care visit because I felt “off” in a way that I couldn’t describe.   I’ve also been back to the urgent care one more time this week because I woke up in the night with an extremely panicked feeling. Unfortunately after calling the ambulance I tried to calm myself by having some alcohol and overdid it, so I was not properly evaluated in the er, just seen as someone who overdid it on alcohol. The first time in the urgent care was helpful, I had an ekg and left feeling a bit better. The second time was less helpful, they checked my blood sugar and sent me home.

I have taken the approach of trying to get stabilized on just phenibut, since pregabalin is seemingly a lot harder to taper. I  currently on my second day with just 200mg pregabalin. I raised phenibut from about 0.9g to about 1.6g to help with the elimination of lyrica, but wow it still hurts every time I reduce. I want to move off it as quickly as possible.

I have no energy over the past few weeks, I sometimes sweat in the night, and worst of all I feel absolutely horrible about myself. I have a new relationship and a good career that I worked so for, I want to make my partner happy and enjoy continued success at work! Instead I spent the day moping around, crying, and trying hard to find others experiences to read. I’m hating myself. It was obviously not a good idea to buy these things, but I didn’t know the extent to which I would suffer after this amount of time. Do you have any tips to manage the depression while tapering? I hate myself, and I hate that it’s so hard to talk about this to anyone.

Additionally, what do you think about my plan to rapidly eliminate pregabalin while compensating with additional phenibut if needed, then taper the phenibut as a single medication it should be a lot more straightforward, right? I have probably taken the pregab *daily* for about 3 months, what is the fastest advisable taper provided I’m willing to compensate by taking additional phenibut? Thank you so much for help or advice!",1,0

Honestly, I can't tell for sure if it's just the fact that I'm in a bit of a rough time these days and the winter season affecting my chemistry. But it's a pretty clear gut feeling. The rebound that I get after a night of drinking has become so pronounced and it seems like it might be the kindling from having went through phenibut withdrawal earlier this year.

Literally even a tiny amount of alcohol and pretty much after exactly 24 hours there is this odd, physical rebound. A sense of weird ""impending doom"". Easy to ignore when you had little but of course becomes full blown anxiety when it was a proper night of drinking.

So warning to everyone using this, ngl, crazy good substance: use it with respect and never ever get into a reckless habit of it. It sure was one of the best feelings I had rolling on pheni, but this is something to either follow the weeks/months rules similar to using MDMA if using recreationally, or keep your dose low and medicinal if you're using it frequently.

Open to hearing if anyone else had this experience and if anything helped ""reverse/fix"" the kindling. Time?",11,0

Just as the title says:- Supplements, Vitamins and equally important is some sage advice for those of us on a slow taper...?

Personally I'm doing a taper from 3.75mg at 0.1g a day dosing x2 a day taking 0.05g off from each dosage until it feels uncomfortable and slowing down if needed by increasing the days sticking at a dose or taking just 0.05g off every 2days if need be. 

What other stuff should I put in my system to increase the chances of avoiding long term withdrawal symptoms after my taper - things like anhedonia, insomnia and general shitty feelings upon quitting.

I've heard of NAC (though I'm still not sure why this is useful on a slow taper, just came across it on some threads.

I am at about 5.2 gpd for the last few years of HCL. 

I still have a few hundred grams of Phenibut HCL but need to start tapering in a way with other gabaergics to keep my supply lasting as long as I can. On top of the F-Phenibut, I have a lot of 10 mg Baclofen tablets that I will chop up and weigh from time to time to help extend my HCL supply. Say subbing 10-15 mg Baclofen for 1 gram HCL sometimes throughout the week.

My question is what is everyone’s take on F-Phenibut for this purpose? I’ve been reading it’s about 5-7X more potent than HCL but different in some regard. My plan was to use a combo of regular HCL, F-Phen HCL, and Baclofen to slowly taper down my daily Phen HCL. 

Say 50% HCL, 25% F-Phen, 25% Baclofen and then increasing the ratio of F-Phen to Bac to HCL (75% to 25%) until I have largely replaced good old HCL with the other 2 and then start a good taper from there.

Then I would stop for three and a half days and feel fine. Then I read about how addictIve Phenibut is. And would start to think “next three and a half day break I’ll go longer to really make sure I don’t get addicted.” Of course that never happened though and I kept doing the same three and a half day breaks until. This past time I didn’t feel normal during the break. And felt fine day one. But then shook a little at night. Then the second day I felt ok. But that night I could barely sleep and kept waking up. And it was HORRIBLE. So after that I knew I was addicted and I really want to taper and stop being dependent on a chemical. And because I’m new to tapering I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations. I have a scooper that’s 500 mg the same size as a normal dose for me. And I thought maybe start at that 5 times a day instead of 6 for a few days. Then drop to 4 times a day for like a week. And then go from there progressively dropping doses.

I never thought I would be here, I thought I’d be stuck forever. I can function during the day, my facial bloating is gone. I feel my blood pressure stabilizing. I don’t have the primal fear anymore. I still get agitated easier but I can’t tell if that’s PAWS or just me. The biggest difference is I’m able to get my work done without the dreaded feeling that I’m going to get fired.

Now I’m an even medium. While we won’t be doing any late night Saturday runs to target to buy toys for no reason…we will have more family time with more conversation instead of my staring at the TV not talking with anyone. 

I want to encourage all of you going through it. I know you hear “embrace the suck” a lot, you really have to. Imagine everyday with WD is your body healing. Taper if possible (I couldn’t) or get some baclofen from your doc, be honest. And remember. The world is NOT caving in on you. Your friends and family LOVE you. Don’t let the negative talk control your mind. Take this as an opportunity for positive self talk. That way when you’re out of the acutes you’ll be supercharged with confidence and optimism!

I have a question about how to handle the tale end of a phenibut taper.

I have been using phenibut daily for 9 months (4.62 grams/day) but started tapering about a month and a half ago. I was originally prescribed 20mg of Baclofen twice a day for anxiety before starting phenibut but when I began taking it daily I was able to discontinue the Baclofen.

After receiving diminishing returns from phenibut, even with trials of increased doses, I decided to taper down using the Baclofen as an aid. I thought that 40mg of Baclofen would be enough to substitute most of my phenibut intake but that 10mg = 1gram calculation seems to not adhere to my case (even after trying a slow integration.) I was, however, able to cut my dose in half.

From 2.31 grams/day + 40mg of Bacolfen, I began tapering the phenibut down 100mg every day with no withdrawal symptoms. At around 1.5 grams/day I started to experience some pretty rough withdrawal symptoms and began tapering down 50mg/day.

I've been doing ok with this schedule (with a few rough days) and I am now down to 633mg/day.

I'm wondering if, like at the 1.5grams/day mark, l will run into a dose where 50mg a day is too much and I will have to lower the daily taper. Also, when the day comes when I've hit a total of 50mg/day, is that my last day? Have you guys noticed you need to dose every other day for a while after that?

When the taper is completely finished is there an adjusting period where I will experience some withdrawals at 0mg/day?

Any insight would be helpful! Thanks!",5,0

However, I have Phenibut coming today. What would you suggest I do, start at a reasonable dosage - say 1.5g to 2g and taper slowly 0.1g a day from that or just plough through until the withdrawals are over (does anyone know when that may be?)

I was tapering from 6g a day and was at around 4.4g before the supply issue. I didn;t want to cold turkey because the accounts of PAWS and longer lasting after effects of doing so. But it isn't so bad.

Also, if you don't mind sharing, what were the symptoms of your cold turkey throughout the days if you don't mind.

Cheers in advance",3,0

I know I need to quit, but part of the reason I find it so difficult to quit and taper is that my usage patterns are varied. 

I use 2.5 grams per day during the week (I consider this my minimum baseline) but 5 grams per day, or more, on weekends when I am in a more social setting and staying up later. Periodically I take an extra gram during the week if I have an important meeting, or social event and I have also periodically gone on “binges” consuming 5 or more grams per day many days in a row of course stretching well into the week. When this happens I usually do a 4 gram day, 3 gram day, then finally back to my 2.5 gram baseline. I have almost zero withdrawal symptoms when I do this but I fully understand this is a terrible practice. 

My goal is to taper off eventually but I don’t know how I am going to get my daily Phenibut useage down to a point where I consume the same amount per day!!

I acknowledge I take it to feel inebriated and I find it very “fun” which is why I take more than my normal daily dose during “fun” times. Please any and all advice is welcome, I am not in control at all and I don’t relate to everyone on here trying to quit, due to my abnormal usage",2,0

I usually get some anxiety and depression which is fine but I have correlated it to every single time my levels get too low my eyes get super sensitive. And this drives me absolutely nuts! I have tried eyedrops to no avail. 
It gets hard to see because they get slightly watery and blurry and the only relief that I get is when I hold my hand on my face right next to the corner of my eyes. 
I stay hydrated because I know phenibut dehydrates you and it is winter and the air is much dryer but everytime it doesn't seem to matter.
I only have this issue with my eyes when I skip taking my phenibut. Never had it before.

Not some giant deal preventing me from reaching my goal because dammit I will get there, but more of just a why? How? Just strange.

I've been a bit confused on how exactly baclofen is replacing phenibut completely for many too. They say 10mg baclofen = 1g phenibut, right?

Just got meds and need help with strategy.,"So I’ve been a daily phenibut user since October 2018. I got into it after a breakup, not for anxiety, but because I read an article about it improving the sex life and I was starting to date again… I met a girl and wanted to keep impressing her socially and sexually so it stuff and slowly ramped up to somewhere around 4gpd in March 2020. At this time I was off work for a few months as Covid was ramping up and one day I decided to quit cold turkey not knowing the ramifications of that. 3 days of pure agony, psychosis, no sleep and I found this sub. I instantly took another small dose of phenibut and over the next couple days was able to stabilize at 1.6gpd. I thought I had it under control to taper from there but I didn’t. Again, I slowly ramped up chasing the high until I was around 8gpd until this past weekend when I realized the supply issues…. Fortunately I have about 900 grams stockpiled but I didn’t want to prolong the agony…

I typically always start my day with about 1.6g in the morning and sometimes trickle .5g in the afternoon but then I would take between 6-7g between 5:30 and 7pm. 

So I had read about people doing an aggressive taper at first and living with the pain for several days so they could stabilize and slow taper from there and that’s what I decided to try.

Sunday I did 1.6g morning and 5.6g evening. No worries
Monday I did 1.6g morning and 3.6g evening. I did feel a little off this day and woke up in the evening with a UTI feeling like I had to pee a lot even though not much came out. I had this last time I went CT or anytime I take less in the evening or too early before bed…
Tuesday I did 1g morning and 3.5g in the evening. I had pretty bad anxiety all day and woke up int the middle of the night with a mild panic attack and kinda tossed and turned until morning with back pain and having to pee for no reason. 
Wednesday I did 1.3g morning and 3.7g in the evening. I felt terrible shaking and cold when I woke up but once that morning dose came in I felt ok for a bit. Just some fear that may have been potentiated from stories on here. But at this point I was desperate for help and I did an online session with an addiction psychologist. He prescribed me baclofen, gabapentin, and Campral (acamprosate) that is to regulate glutamate. I didn’t get the prescriptions wed night…
Thursday (today) I did 1.3 g this morning and it’s as if it never kicked in. I slept ok last night from 9:30pm -4am and mostly just tossed after that but feeling relatively comfortable. I was thinking I was getting over the hump to stabilize at 5g. But I had terrible anxiety when I went to pick up my prescriptions I was shaking and lightheaded with an elevated heart rate. I could not calm myself down no matter how hard I tried. anyways, even though I have zero appetite I ate some chips and dark chocolate cookies 🍪 n the way home before taking 300mg gabapentin. After about 20-30 min I felt like I was calming down a bit but still not nearly baseline so I took another 300mg and feel pretty good right now. 

But I don’t know where to go from here. 
Why did my morning dose not do anything this morning? That’s scary. Could it be because I barely ate anything yesterday?

Anyways, The psychiatrist prescribed me this schedule:
Baclofen 5mg 3 times a day for the first five days and 10mg 3 times a day after that. 
Gabapentin 100mg morning and 100mg afternoon and 1200mg before bed. 
The other stuff is on order…

Does this sound like a healthy strategy to continue stabilizing at 5g and then tapering 250mg/week?

Btw. I have been taking 1g agmatine before every dose and 600mg NAC morning and night. I’m also taking melatonin and lemon balm before bed and 4-600 L theanine throughout the day.",6,1

(No disrespect),"Okay so I’ve been a addict since my teenage years. Got out of rehab about 3 months ago for benzos. 9 days ago, I started to dabble in phenibut again and I told myself I’m only gonna do it one day. Long story short, the one day turned into a 7 day binge. First day I started with 3.5 grams and by the 7th day I was at 8 grams. 

Day 8 late into the day the rebound started to get pretty bad so I decided I was going to rapid taper. I took 6.5 grams. 


Day 9 I took 6 grams and I’m planning on dropping 500 mg each day until I hit 2 grams. From there, I’m going to taper with baclofen. 


Should I keep doing what I’m doing or should I just stop and take baclofen as needed for the rebound? I have 30 5 mg baclofen. I also have ashwaganda, valerian, chamomile tea and limited l-theanine.

I went through a really tough breakup last year and becausekratom wasn't really doing it for me anymore I ended up getting hooked on phenibut as well.

I was prioritizing my kratom taper as I think personally the negative effects of kratome are worse than those of phenibut.

I'm going through a lot emotionally, some really challenging struggles in my professional life, so I have to be slow and gentle with this, otherwise I'm going to end up falling back down into this hole I've dug. I think the smart way to approach this is to alternate reducing my doses. Since these drugs both have similar but different mechanisms of action, I think alternating will give me more time to adjust the new dose of each substance as I work my way down into the harder stages of this.

I had close calls, one time I drove 200 miles and back on the verge of a panic attack to pick up an order while 2 days into a 15 GPD withdrawal which led me to taper down to 6 GPD. after I hit that mark it seemed impossible to go any lower and get more than a couple hours of sleep so I just stayed at that dose and lived my life normally as if I wasn’t hooked on a little white powder that would tear my life apart if I went a few days without it. I’m now graduated from college and I have been doing my best to pretend it’s no big deal but the anxiety is catching up. 

I’m tired of hiding the fact that I’m an addict from everyone in my life and bringing a little tub of powder with my every time I go on a trip, hiding in the bathroom to take it. I’m tired of fearing what will happen if I end up in the hospital or catch Covid and can’t access my stash. I’m tired of planning my day around when I’ll actually feel relaxed and able to socialize.

I’m tired of pounding tums and baking soda to fight constant acid reflux. 

I’m tired of spending hundreds of dollars a month on phenibut and drugs and supplements that will help the anxiety. I’ve been graduated and working for months but I’ve barely saved any money because I spend it all on nicotine, kratom, and phenibut, and come up with excuses as to why I still have no money. I went through my last batch faster than I realized and nearly had a panic attack when I realized it was sold out everywhere. I had an order on the way that got delayed so I had to get another one and pay for rush shipping, I was terrified the whole time it wouldn’t arrive in time and it got here when I had less than a days supply left. All my Christmas money is gone. I could’ve paid a couple months rent with the amount I’ve spent on shit that is actively making my life worse.

I continued using phenibut and it eventually turned into a daily use thing and before I know it I was taking 5+ grams per day. now, I was only using that much daily for just over one month but I tried cutting my dose in half for a few days and experienced quite a bit of anxiety so I went to 4.5 grams and pretty rapidly tapered down to 1.8 grams per day where I am at now. 

I am 3 days into 1.8 grams per day and there is definitely some anxiety and discomfort in general but nothing I can't handle. CBD flower has been a life saver and because of it, I am actually sleeping really well and have hours at a time of feeling really good. 

I came down to 1.8 GPD pretty rapidly and rather than continuing to rapidly taper, I am considering staying at this dose for either one or 2 weeks before taking the next steps down but am unsure of what to expect. 

I know everyone's physiology is completely different but can anyone give general advice on this? can I expect my body to adjust to 1.8 GPD in a week or 2? if that is the case, I believe I can easily manage slowly working my way down from there, maybe 300mg less per week after that is what I was thinking but I really don't know much about this so I suppose I just want to know what I may or may not be in for. 

When I make up my mind to get off of something, I get off of it for good and I am so strong willed that I sometimes have the opposite problem that many do where rather than going back up in dose or taking it too slowly, I end up really rapidly tapering and just dealing with it but I want to be a little more patient with myself this time but I do not plan to go back up from here, just don't know what the best course of action is to taper down from 1.8 GPD or how long to stay at this dose before tapering more.

The first few months of the phenibut turning on me at 4gs a day was what I actually imagine is the real hell. Absolutely mind recoiling “anxiety” and horrifying thoughts made me feel like I was never going to be better and I was stuck in this odd terrifying dimension.

I did the agmatine(2g twice a day)and switched over to phenibut FAA, and it helped but not completely. It wouldve taken more mental power than I had to tough through that and once I understood I couldnt, I went to the doctor. 

No matter what, if you arent okay then go to the doctor. I went 4-5 times getting buspirone the first, and the last time she did her research and gave me klonopin. The klonopin completely turned me “back to normal” and gave me the ability to drop half grams without fear. I am now off klonopin and phenibut, instead on propranolol, lexapro, and buspirone.

Things arent perfect now but the message you should get from my experience is go to the doctor if you cant handle it anymore. Know your mind and know when to draw the line. Be honest with whoever you see and let them do their research so they can know how to treat you.",5,0

Then I thought long and hard about it, it didn’t occur to me straight away. It took a few jogs, a few times to think in the shower, and one morning, I was sitting down looking at my bank account and wasn’t happy with it. It clicked to me. 

My reason I am taking phenibut is I’m not happy with my financial situation. I take it so I can feel a sense of self worth and actually FEEL like I am confident and happy. I wanted to do things and I didn’t have the money to waste on doing things like that. Phenibut made me a riskier person but also made me lose a fuck loada money.

Then I set myself a goal, let’s build some sort of passive income so I don’t have to rely on a chemical for my self worth. 

Now my goal is feel a healthy amount of self worth without even needing to rely on wealth to do so.

for a multitude of reasons, I've been using Phenibut for about 4 months now, for about 2 1/2 or maybe 3 months I take a single dose of **400mg every second day** in the morning. I have underlying depression and anxiety and was addicted to other drugs before, but no GABA. I did drop Kratom via ct and taper often.

I had very good results and no negatives with that 400mg routine, but for some time now, effects slowly diminished from anxiety relief to not much at all. I was dead set on not upping my dose or frequency from the very beginning as I know about the heavy withdrawals connected to phenibut. Up until about 2 weeks ago, but now I started to experience heightened anxiety on off-days, and that + no effects on on days is just not worth it anymore. And I crave it more. Not a good sign.

**Is it WD already or is it rebound anxiety? Am I worrying too much?**

Thing is, I'm writing my most important paper, my thesis, right now. I won't be finished in at least 2-3 months. I can't be anxious now, thats just not the right time.

**How to continue?**

In Kratom taper one of the tricks was to spread doses out to prevent mid-dose WD. What do you think about going from 400mg once every second day to 100mg every morning and evening? Would add up to the same gpd. Or 200 every morning? Will going to daily use but same gpd cause more problems in the end? Am I overreacting and should just cut use now? If I do so, what am I in for? Or stay at 400mg every second day but reduce 10% every dose? I don't know what to do.

I also have a psychiatrist appointment, sadly only in 8 weeks. In theory I could also wait for that and hope for medical assisted taper.

Thank you for any input!",5,0

Luckily I stocked up but I’m still concerned. I’ve read multiple people try to reassure that it’s supply chain issues and not the current FDA bs but has anyone else read/heard anything? LM and ND claim it’s just supply chain issues but I’m hesitant to completely trust that. Anybody have any ideas if/when there might be more phenibut? 

I went from a 30 gpd habit down to 3 gpd relatively quickly. I keep purposefully relapsing because I’m a professional musician with aspergers and bp2 and I gig often…it’s hard to not play gigs on phenibut because I will just drink myself into a stupor. My goal has been to stop taking phenibut every day and only take phenibut at gigs. 

We all know that the phenibut tolerance doesn’t seem to go away so when I play my gigs 1-2 times per week I end up taking 15 grams that day which would be like a more normal addict taking like 5 grams I feel like. It might surprise you, considering my previous insane dose, that if I take 15 grams even two days in a row I can jump back to my 3 gpd dose my without unmanageable withdrawal. It’s mostly just exhaustion that I feel and the rebound anxiety is basically the same as what my autism causes.

Anyway…I’m really really praying that the absence of phenibut is strictly supply shortages and not a quiet submission to the government because I rely on it for my professional gigging life. Having autism and bipolar type 2 is very difficult as is let alone expecting to entertain large audiences. I’m pretty worried. 

While I’m at it, my thoughts are with the rest of you struggling. This isn’t my first rodeo. I previously was addicted to 30 gpd and then weened off and spent 4 months clean from phenibut. I only went back to it because I began self medicating with alcohol and adderall again. But when I see people with a lot of worry over a few gpd addiction just remember that I did it at 30 gpd and have two mental disorders so you can do it too.

First week, I cut to 5gpd. Felt fine, so for the past couple weeks I've tapered by 1gpd. It's been almost a month, I'm taking 3gpd and I feel... Great?

I'm aware of all of the terrible withdrawal symptoms and horror stories and I know I'm not some freak of nature that would completely avoid any issues. I fully expect to have to slow waaay down with my taper, but I honestly don't feel any withdrawal symptoms and actually enjoy the feeling more so far. One caveat is that I do have a prescription for 300mg of gabapentin 3x a day and this may very well be a bit reason that I haven't had issues. If anyone has had a similar experience, should I expect things to change? I will, of course, modify my taper if things change. I'm just surprised and really happy that so far it's been a breeze.

I was pretty terrified to start tapering, because my job requires me to be very outgoing and talk to people all day.

FULL STORY: 

Hello. This is my first post here( or on Reddit) and I could really use some help with a potentially tough situation that I brought on myself

I've been a Phenibut user for MANY years. My doses were always very high, but for most of those years I took it twice a week. And even at doses in the high teens, it was never an issue. I could take breaks with no issue.

But over the last year, because of various stress and anxiety inducing issues in my life, I began to ramp up how often I took it. And over the last 4+ months, I've basically been taking 18-20 grams every 48 hours, with no other breaks. Phenibut lasts a long time in me, so thankfully I never needed to use it back to back days. 

Well, I took a 19 gram usual dose Wednesday evening. When i take it, I usually take it between 5-7 PM, then 3-4 hours later I take a 3-4 hour nap. This works great because it helps me combat the noding, sleepy feeling I get on Phenibut. I wake up a feel great all day long, sleep great, and then the following day still feel some effects and sleep pretty good. 

Then yesterday, I go and take my dose and...no Phenibut. None. I don't know what happened, a brain fart and maybe I confused my Phenibut jar with my Agmatine jar, which is the same size and consistency. No idea, in fact I'm even embarrassed about it. I placed an order with a different vendor( my usual one is out of stock) but it's not gonna ship out until tuesday, which means I'll get it Thursday at the earliest, but likely Friday( which will be 9 days after my last dose) And I checked locally and there doesn't seem to be a place where I can get it in person. 

So I'm in it. I'm facing this with no taper and no choice in the matter. So far, it's tolerable. It's gonna be 72 hours since my last dose in about 6 hours. But based on past experiences, I will have trouble sleeping tonight and the anxiety and other symptoms will hit tomorrow morning

So basically what I am asking in this long post( thank you to anyone who read it) is for some advice as to what I can get OTC to help me through this. My GF has Xanax and she could break loose a couple if i need it, though that hasn't worked for me for anxiety in the past. I have Kratom, which I only really use once in a while WITH Phenibut. I also have Ashwaganda, GABA, Valerian Root, and L Theanine. I've had very mild luck with L Theanine and Valerian, but not much. I know Magnesium will help a bit and I'm well stocked on that. Anything else that might help? Any other advice? I don't do well with Weed or Delta 8, so if anyone was gonna suggest that it's not gonna work. I'm not a drinker, but I have booze. 1-2 drinks sometimes offers mild and temporary relief, but anything more usually just makes me more anxious after it wears off.

I'm hoping since it was every other day and not everyday that maybe it won't be as bad? Maybe this will end up being a good thing. If I can make it until my shipment comes and it's not too bad, maybe I'll just take more time off and then try to get back to twice a week. I don't want to quit taking this altogether, because it has helped me greatly and was never an issue when i took it twice a week. this isn't Phenibut's fault, this is my fault. But I also don't want to keep taking it every other day as I have been

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Thanks",6,0

I am using 300mg phenibut capsule from liftmode.

My questions are :

-How fast should I taper using 300mg caps ? 1 caps every 6 Days would be 50mg drop daily. Thats would be my guess

-should I divise my dose ? I am using all at once

-when should I take IT ? I am currently taking between 10am and 13pm

I Will not use powder only the caps. I need the conveniance and dont have the patience to weigh the powder

I work from 7:00 to 16:00 and 16:30 to 22:00

i was having really bad bloating and it made me soooo hungry i was eating up all the food in my house. along with constipation and dehydration.

needless to say i needed something different.

went to my suboxone dr. for help, 
he would not give me baclofen. went to my pcp, she told me to taper (i already started to taper and no matter how much i took, same symptoms). went to ER, they knew nothing about phenibut.

i was able to get ahold of some gabapentin.

i immediately switched from taking 600mg phenibut 3x daily
to taking 400 mg gabapentin 3x daily.

i had minor uncomfortable symptoms like lack of motivation and decreased appetite but i was more than willing to deal with it. im day 5 taking the gabapentin and i feel like it has leveled out. all the phenibut should be out of my system and now i can start to taper gabapentin.

this is my experience and not sure if anyone else has had similar experience switching to gabapentin. seems to be much more manageable.

i plan on tapering 100mg every 3  days or so.

When I quitted 5 drugs(gabapentin, baclofen, suboxone, valium and main thing - phenibut, by tapering) at same time, during awful withdrawal, my friend advised one book. You just read about 7 pages per week and training/meditate 15-30 minutes a day. Seems easy, but almost no one wants to do it, but I saw many things in my life and can say, that this book is amazing. Our brain can do anything, we just to find a key for success. So imagine, I'm giving you a lottery ticket, but how much you'll won, depends on you. Dont look at this sceptical and don't think that success will come after 8 days, it's like a gym(but for brain), you can't build body and be in a shape after few days, but I can promise, if you will work hard, only few minutes a day, after few weeks you will feel difference... Just don't stop when you feel better, continue working on yourself every day! The book is:    Charles F. Haanel - The master key system. Good luck and best wishes! P.S. Sorry for my English 😊

Edit: I've done it once, weared from ALL DRUGS,  but when I felt much, much better and happier, I made a stupid mistake and stopped training. After some time, I lost 4 of my family members and as I was not in ""shape"" I started do drugs again, but now I'm tapering from everything and MUST start again.

I’ve probably only dosed 6 or 7 times total and never more than twice in the span of a week. Never two days in a row.

Monday night and Tuesday night I slept fine but noticed I felt quite anxious consistently throughout the day. Now, these past two nights I’ve pretty much gotten 0 sleep.

Here's what helped.,"I was a ""phenibut only once every week or two"" person until the pandemic hit.  Spiked anxiety (about the societal shift, not the virus), too much overthinking, and new telecommute lent itself to using multiple times per week, then daily, then 1g/day, then 2, then 2.5.  I'm sure the story is really familiar.

I knew it would not be sustainable nor did I want to be withdrawing when I returned to in person work.  I started with a very aggressive taper and surprisingly got down from 2.5 to 500 mg rather easily.  Oddly enough, the drop from 200mg to 100mg a day seemed to cause a bit more challenge than the rest, especially in the area of migraines and nausea.    

What helped me deal with it all has been:

Exercise, 
Tons of water every day, 
Sun exposure, 
Delta-8 THC,  
CBD, 
Kratom (though I'd suggest being careful, as some people seem to have W/Ds from it.  I don't.),
Kanna extract, 
Deep breathing exercises,
Keeping myself occupied 

I'm at 60mg/day now and will likely be done entirely soon.  I have zero desire to head back up and I'm going to not order it anymore.  I don't ever want it so badly as to order it, but if I have some sitting around here, that's asking for trouble.  The payoff isn't worth the consequence.

I doubt anything in here is surprising or revolutionary, but on the offhand chance it might help someone, I thought I'd share.

If I can do it, I believe others can.  I'm not particularly strong or resilient, and somehow I made it down.",13,2

Decided to try my herbal stack without using hardcore gabaergics like Phenibut/alcohol/Benzos or the gabapentin.

Subjective experience:
It worked very well. Within an hour I noticed my hands relax and slowly open up from the unaware fist clenched position, my eye lids relaxed to alleviate the wide-eyed hunted prey feeling, and I was able to start my day with moderately improved anxiety.


Stack:
* l theanine
* chamomile extract
* lemon balm
* valerian root
* magnesium threonate
* ginkgo bilopa 
* aniracetam 1000 mg (this could increase anxiety and/or headache, so it would be wise to use caution or at least include a choline supplement)

I’ve also found Kava and bacopa M to be helpful, although I’m a little hesitant to take the Kava regularly. I consistently take vitamin D, fish oil, probiotic, and do powerlifting with occasional cardio. 

I feel it’s noteworthy to mention that red strains of Kratum have helpfed immensely in the past, but I developed an addiction to that which lasted 5 months and had moderately difficult withdrawal.

The past 1-2 years I’ve been at 1.75 g daily. My use started with Sleepwalkers that a friend gave me. I had no idea what Phenibut even was at the time until it was too late. I’ve tried to quit before I found this sub and failed. I’m serious about it now and have everything I need (I think). When I try to quit, my agitation is out of this world. That along with depression, loss of pleasure, anxiety, and the insomnia are awful. I’ve ordered the HCl crystals. I was taking the FAA capsules. I read somewhere when searching that you need to up your dose by 20% with the HCl. Please let me know if that’s not correct. I got a scale along with black seed oil in a couple of days ago that I’ve been taking. I have NAC and Agmatine both ordered from LM that will be here today. I am also on prescribed adderall for ADD. I am absolutely doing a slow taper to try to keep the withdrawal to a minimum. I’ve searched this sub and the Phenibut sub and never found the same answer twice so my questions are:

1. Is it better to taper by like 10% a week, 10/25/50 mg a day, or some other way? I was thinking 25 mg off both doses every day to equal 50, but I don’t want to feel fine and then the withdrawal start hitting 3-5 days into the taper. 

2. How often and how much NAC and Agmatine? 

3. I read that taking both NAC and Agmatine together make adderall ineffective. Does anyone know if that’s the case?

Edit: 4. Is it better if tapering by mg daily to drop 100-500 and then stay at that amount for a few days to a week, and then repeat that process?",8,0

( A warning),"Not really a long term daily user. I had a 4 day long weekend binge. Stopped using and after 2 days, like clock work the come down hit me like a brick. I had sleep paralysis almost immediately after going into sleep. I had hallucinations of witches and people in my life laughing in my ear as i was unable to move. Sensations of evil beings literally putting their mouth onto my ear and evily laughing as i was unable to escape. This happened no less than 3 times before i finally broke through into the dream world (I learned how to force myself to dream while in SP) And boy was it no better. So the dream starts out with me wondering around a packed bar and everyone is dancing im socializing and just having a good time. But something is off everyone seems artificial and fake like robots.

 I can not remember all the details but it seemed like the dream went on for a very long time. I was only asleep for an hour but it felt like the dream had lasted an entire night. I talk with random people, some of them people that exist in the real world others total strangers. I see exes, friends, family, crushes, teachers etc Everything is just so vivid almost clearer than real life which is unusual because normally my dreams have a hazy cartoonish effect and i am always somewhat aware i am dreaming. The music was so effing clear it was unbelievable and what's even more unbelievable is the music did not exist it was all generated by my head and it actually sounded pretty good! it had lyrics, hooks, instrumentals everything. It's amazing that the human brain can create its own world on the fly with such precision that when i woke up it felt as if real life was fake and the dream was my reality. 

by the end of the dream i start wising up and realizing that something was off. i decide to step inside of the bathroom and look in the mirror and oh my god was it the most demoralizing thing i have ever witnessed. I looked at my face and i looked about 50 years old and im only 22. my face was swelled up, i looked like i had just been out of a warzone. I was missing an eye (yes, missing an eye) it was a black hole filled with blood slowly dripping out. I had the worst look you could ever see on a human being. What wasn't covered in blood was showing dry, cracked, hallow flesh that looked like it could break off at the slightest touch. I stared at it for minutes in denial but it just looked so real. I stormed out of the bathroom crying at what i had seen. A nearby woman had seen me and asked me what was wrong. I said ""Hold me"" and she hugged me and started singing a song ""getting oooolddeer"" as the instrumental appeared out of thin air as if i were in a movie the world started to fade around my vision And then i had woke up drenched in sweat. 

there was way more that happened in the dream  but most of it by now has escaped my memory. I was not planning on taking any more phenibut until next week but god help me if i have to go through that every time i try to go to sleep. I am taking half of my previous dose in order to ease the comedown. Hopefully it stops the ultra realistic nightmares because i could have definitely dreamed something way worse than that and i am not trying to find out.",12,0

The days before, I started to have intense feelings of WD that would only get worse when I dosed again.  They basically put me to sleep with Ativan as much as they could because the feeling was so awful and intense for me and I definitely was at risk of having a seizure.  It felt exactly like phenibut withdrawal, if not worse.  Eventually, my symptoms and hallucinations started to get better as I got less and less toxified.  Then the doctor prescribed me gabapentin which is also a gaba b agonist, and without really thinking, i took it and went right back to feeling super shitty again with more anxiety, tremors, hallucinations etc.   On the morning of the day i got discharged, I finally put two and two together and declined the baclofen they tried to give me for my supposed withdrawals because I figured I was still intoxicated and the baclofen would just make me feel like shit again.  I did take the buspar they prescribed me, not knowing that buspar effects your gaba b receptors and so it gave me more tremors and hallucionations.  I  was still feeling super shitty if not worse that evening, like the effects from the buspar werent going away, so I thought that I might actually finally be going into withdrawal.  I took a gabapentin and I didn't get any worse or better, so i thought taking another one might actually give me some relief, but omg was I wrong.  I spent the evening most of the night shaking and hallucinating like crazy, pounding chamomile tea, smoking joints, doing anything to make it go away.   
 I decided that I'm not going to take anything gaba b related and just ride it out this time until Im back to my base line.  Luckily i got my doctor to send a script of hydroxyzine over to me, and after taking a couple of those and a benedryl I fell asleep.  I woke up feeling like a trainwreck, but with no WD or intoxication symtoms, but its 2pm here and the symptoms are coming back, and Idk if its because the hydroxyzine wearing off or if im actually in withdrawal.  the last time I took a gabapentin was yesterday, early in the afternoon.  Does it sound like I'm actually in withdrawal now?  Or will taking another baclofen or gabapentin just make me feel worse?  I have no idea.  I havent slept for like 4 days, and im totally confused as to what the fuck is going on with my body...If anyones been through something like this please share any advice you have.  sorry if this post is a mess.

Due to personal problems I've made a mistake. I've been using phenibut for 3 week straight at 900 mg per day. I am now scared to stop because of potential withdrawals. 

How should I taper to avoid them ?

Little history if you're curious:

I've been using phenibut for more than 5 years. The first year I was using high doses around 3-4g once a week. One week I took 3-4 grams on 2 consecutive days and got 5 days major withdrawals. Insomnia, panic attack, anxiety you name it. Horrible times.

Then I stopped for a month and started back at once a week. For the last year and a half I took it twice a week at 3-4g dose with 3 days break between doses. Had bad rebound anxiety -fight or flight mode if taking caffeine 2 days after. If no caffeine, just feeling down.

Then had fertility problems (I'm a male) so stopped taking it for 60 days and that helped a bit. I find that nobody talks about potential fertility problems regarding phenibut. 

Then, took it the 3 weeks straight at 900 mg that I talked about. 

Thank you",4,0

124,2022-01-09 18:47:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/s05753/taper_update/,Taper Update,"Hey Everyone, just wanted to follow up and give an update on the taper and things that have been working/not been working for me thus far.

Recap: Have used phenibut off and on for 2 years, but been on 3-5gpd for roughly the last 8 months before deciding I needed to taper and get off.

Today's Dose was 490mg

I have been cutting down by 100mg every day and despite some slightly more noticeable side effects  the lower I get (anxiety, depression, fatigue) I am planning to continuing to drop by 100mg each day, meaning I am projected to take my last dose this Thursday which will be only 90mg.

Currently I am taking agmatine sulfate 2x per day, once with my morning phenibut dose and once more in the evening.

The things that have been significantly helping me recently have been:

1. High Intensity Exercise. I normally work out, but during my taper I committed myself to higher intensity workouts in an effort to rebalance brain chemicals and exhaust my body and by extension my mind. I have been having days during my taper that I just want to lay in bed, but by forcing myself to get up and workout in those moments not only am I doing something physically good for myself, but am finding it a source of pride that I got up and did it despite feeling shitty. 
2. Taking a break from social media and music. Upon starting my taper I got off all my social media and have taken a break from listening to music (a normally necessary part of my day). Doing so has allowed my mind to relax to a degree, not feeling the imperative to put out content or judge myself negatively next to someone elses account. It has been my experience that less stimulation (media, music, social networking, etc.) has really helped me cope with quitting.
3. Staying busy. I know this may sound lame, but by doing simple things such as cleaning my apartment; re-organizing my workspace; going on walks; and checking out new books, I have been able to overcome each day without too much down time to where my mind might otherwise take over and drag me into a bad place. I think it's important that although we want to just curl up and do nothing that we continually engage ourselves lest we spiral into the feelings of discomfort that come with withdrawal or feel compelled to give into our cravings.

The 3 things listed above have been tremendously helpful for me. Although I have seen them listed here as being helpful: l-theanine, NAC, and melatonin have not been entirely helpful for me. Not that they don't have any place in a taper but my experience hasn't felt their proscribed benefits.

I hope that my account so far helps some of you in your journey to quit. Remember, don't give up, stopping this is a process worth seeing through and no matter what you think we will recover; the body has a tremendous capacity to heal itself and will do so given time and care.

It still is all bearable but I feel like the baseline has increased especially when messing around with GABA. By baseline I mean in those rebound days when it seems to come in intervals, not 24/7.

Started off just for a nice mood boost every couple days, then my boss came into town and I stayed on it for a week, increasing my dose every day.. because it made me this bubbly great guy around someone who is soooo difficult to deal with haha. Anyways, I’m sure you all know what happened after that. Tried stopping for a day and I had horrible anxiety and depression all day, and couldn’t sleep at all that night. Ended up dosing the next day, and a month or two later I was taking about 9gpd. Tried tapering down, and same thing, boss came back into town, my dose went back up, and I started back at square one. Anyways. I was at 6gpd last month, and I now am at 2.1 gpd. I was feeling extremely depressed and anxious this last week and I started taking kratom once a day. Probably not the best idea as I used to be a heroin addict but the shit definitely helps me get thru the day. I don’t know how to do this right. I’m committed to quitting this shit, but I HATE how I feel right now. I don’t know what I should do different.  I work out every morning, (take the tapering dose of phenibut with my pre workout) and the endorphins help for sure. At work during the day I have a tonnnn of anxiety, but I’m able to get thru the day. After work I take the kratom which gets me thru the evening, then I dose the phenibut about 2hours before I go to bed. Surprisingly, every time I wake up I can go back to sleep, but I do wake up a lot thought out the night. I’ve been going down .35g every few days, and now that I’m almost sub 2 grams, I intend on going down .1g every couple days. Asides from the kratom I haven’t been taking anything but I have access to just about every supplement under the sun. I have NAC but I’ve read everywhere that it takes away from the euphoria that the kratom gives and I’m not sure what it does to help w coming off of phenibut, so I’m reluctant to take it.

I'm very skeptical that tapering is necessary and I am very suspicious of the push for it for most people.

Edit:  People:  I am speaking about someone who maybe has done 250-1g/ day for like a month.  Not people who have been using it for a long time. Also, phenibut is insanely profitable and the vendors are all up in Reddit. So, the question stands. Still skeptical.

Edit2: The cessation ""cold turkey"" is going well. 2g of Penis Envy mushrooms followed by 15mg of DMT the next morning, seems to have cleaned me out quite nicely.

Edit3: for science, i feel terrible and am going to suffer a bit. I was hoping there was a way to escape paying the piper. Yes, you should probably taper. It sucks that one of the greatest molecules in existence will literally endanger  my mental health to a critical state if I use it more than once a week. Like many I've often tried to find out if I'm one of the lucky few who can escape the nasty side effects. I'm not.

Edit4: I was discussing this in another post, and I think where the organic tryptamines like psilocybin and DMT shine is when the taper is complete and one is fully committed to living without the substance in question.  I was reflecting on the fact that this is exactly how psilocybin helped me quit nicotine.  Expecting them to do all the heavy lifting without me putting in the work is wrong on every level. I certainly don't beat myself up for trying though.  You live, experiment, and learn. Well hopefully you live.  I concur with the consensus that tapering is best for most substances. Leaving all this up for education and posterity.  

Also I would add: I don't think we ought to be ashamed if we end up needing to seek medical intervention.  It's not off the table for me if it ever seems necessary.",0,0

My life is so stressful and I turned back to the drug that just turned on me a month ago.

I hate that I’m an addict but I have to accept it. I quit before and used Lyrica among other supplements/medications to help and it was bad but not horrifying.

Now I’ve been back at it for about two weeks, at my highest 2gpd of FAA.

I just went to my doctor and got honest about it and he prescribed me Gabapentin and switched me off my Lyrica as he read that Gabapentin is helpful in withdrawal (which, fuck if it isn’t.)

I’m on 2,400mg a day - I have fibromyalgia as well, thus the higher dose. Today I took 750mg of Phenibut in the morning and my Gabapentin throughout the day.

Tomorrow I plan to take none and just ride it out - I’m throwing the rest of my shit away. I can’t do it anymore and honestly, self-medicating has put me in such a dark spot. I’m anxious and depressed and feel like I’m just going through the motions. My hypochondria has been awful.

I guess I’m saying all this bc I need support, guys. I hate that I did this to myself again and just needed to tell on my behavior to someone… nobody in my life knows that I’m struggling with this. I have so much responsibility and people counting on me that I can’t let them down. I just want to be happy again.

Some months ago I was hit overnight with extreme caffeine intolerance (went from three energy drinks a day to 50mg in the morning with l-theanine), myoclonic twitches, and the hypnic shocks when I go to bed. The shocks only occur when I’m falling to sleep and it feel like 500 volts to the head or chest. 

I was putting it off, but it feels like the zaps are getting worse, so I’m tapering with agmatine, NAC, L-theanine, and my primary prescribed me hydroxyzine which seems to help with the anxiety, so basically the nighttime shocks are the only thing persisting nightly. 

Is there any recommendations you can provide to help get me to sleep without worrying if I’m having a stroke/heart attack, or do I just have to get off it and let time do it’s thing? Haha",3,0

Black seed oil (Nigella sativa L. (Black Cumin) Heals and Repairs.,"I've quit phenibut 5 times. A couple times due to supply I had to do cold turkey, which IMO is worse than benzo, heroin, and many other hard withdrawals. The only withdrawal that can compare is GHB withdrawal. I've got a lot of trial and error experience in withdrawal, and especially GABA related withdrawal.  


You need to choose how you want to get off it. You can wean down to 50mg (starting at 2000mg) in a couple months without much pain. but the temptation to take more to kill off some withdrawals is VERY high for people addicted to this substance. 

You can go right to baclofen and use max 10-15mg 2x a day, I see A LOT of people go over that and get stuck on baclofen. You'll see people in here post all the time now they are addicted to that stuff because they didn't wean properly. You can get off phenibut withdrawals in 10 days or less with baclofen. When day 10 hits, make sure you're at 2mg (i got to .5mg in the past) of baclofen and just step off. 

The most important part of this post is Black seed oil. Because it has repaired my gaba system. In about 2 weeks after quitting phenibut I felt happy and normal again. Every time before when I quit phenibut I was messed up gaba wise for months and months, a very hard recovery, and even harder every time I turned back to phenibut and had to get off it again. Phenibut is evil to me, one of the most evil sneaky drugs out there. 

After all the times I've withdrawn from this stuff, I am amazed how fast black seed oil extract fixed my brain. Staying on phenibut and doing a slow ass wean, or using phenibut and bac at the same time then a slow wean off bac is just putting yourself through un-needed GABA damage. 

Do your own research on black seed oil and you'll be shocked in a good way. This stuff has me feeling happy and normal again, which I took for granted how amazing it is to be normal without drugs.

It's helped tremendously with my anxiety issues too. 


black seed has been around and used for 1000s of years.

I hope this day finds you each well!

I have decided it is finally time to kick this Phenibut issue formally and would appreciate any advice or thoughts anyone has to share.  I ended up on Phenibut as an augmentation to my Gabapentin which I take for nerve pain due to back surgeries.  I still deal with some percentage of pain, but really am ready to get off the Phenibut ride as the positive effects are gone and my mental health has deteriorated  noticeably.

I've been on the Phenibut about 6 months with daily dosage up to 6gpd for a short window.  Currently I am down to the following daily:

3g Phenibut HLC - 1.5g in morning (Empty Stomach), 1.25g at noon (Empty Stomach) and 0.25g at bedtime  
2g Agmatine Sulfate - 1G each with morning and noon Phenibut  
2.7g Gabapentin - Taken 300mg every 30 minutes starting at 10:00am with small protein snack.  
Delta8 (Diet THC) - Taken in afternoons/evenings as needed

I do have Phenibut faa available as well where better suited.

I originally planned to just taken 1 less pill a week (250mg each) which would put me at about 12 weeks until done (know that the last week or 2 may need to be stretched), but I would really like to shorten this timeline as much as I can within reason.

Meaning, you take not to get a buzz. But just the right amount not to feel low.","I've browsed this community before, but I always like I didn't want to be reminded of this secret addiction.  However, it's the one thing in my life I desperately want to change.   I'm not going to publicly put out there my dosage levels or how long I've been using.  But I see some folks in here that are very honest about using more than what I have been.  It's a brave thing to do, so hat's off to you.

I remember the original sub in the past people were so judgmental.  Inquisitive as to your dosages.  It was a huge turn off.

I've discovered in the past year I've come into some stability (financial, and independence) that I haven't used to mask that previous stress.  As a result I would say a natural taper is beginning but I still have way to go.

I call myself a ""placeholder user"" because I use phenibut as a mood stabilizer.  Almost an anti-depressant.  There's no need to get high off it.  I have a stock to weather the current supply chain issues.  That's what drew me to check out the various subreddits tonight.

I have a grip on science.  So terms like glutamate storm and ways to counteract a phenomenon appeal to me.  It seems that a few of you have come across supplements to assist a taper.    Another person mentioning a pill machine to keep tabs on dosages,   I would agree that a slow taper over is the way to go.  Like Andy in Shawshank with that rock hammer.  Phenibut addiction is a literal prison.  But we can crawl through the shit to freedom

I’m looking for advice on a taper schedule for a near 2-year phenibut habit of 1 g/day. 

Let me preface by saying I’m aware of the recklessness of taking phenibut every day, especially for almost 2 years. It’s probably a familiar story but it didn’t start as a daily thing; just something to help with social engagements (I have social anxiety). Eventually it just got easier to take every day than deal with the rebound anxiety, fogginess and depression, and I told myself eventually I could just taper off. I recently moved out of state and am working from home, so very few social engagements these days. So I figure it’s a good time to quit. 

I’ve read that you should taper by 10% every 2 to 4 weeks. However, I’m concerned about the length of time I’ve been using it and am having trouble finding taper schedules that factor in specific duration of use. 

My main concern is probably my job. I write  seo content with a weekly quota of 25,000 words, which is very difficult to fulfill as is. I can’t imagine trying to meet the quota with withdrawal symptoms, even mild ones. 

I have a long history of depression and social anxiety, and have had a few panic attacks in the last couple of years. So even though I think my dose of 1g was relatively mild, and even though I plan to taper, I’m a little scared about the taper process and about how well I’ll cope after it’s done. 

For transparency, I also take just under 7g Kratom a day split into two doses of about 3.4 g and 3.5g. I know this makes my situation even more stupid and reckless. But I plan to stay on the kratom till after the pheni taper then taper off it as well. Maybe it will help with possible pheni w/d’s? 

My current pheni schedule is 3x a day, at .36g, .28g, and .36g. 

So I guess what I’m looking for is advice on whether the standard taper schedule will be slow enough given my duration of use, job requirements, and anxiety/depression. Also if anyone wants to hazard an opinion on if I should consider going on antidepressants during the taper? (Had a prescription for Zoloft about 10 years ago and liked how it made me feel).
