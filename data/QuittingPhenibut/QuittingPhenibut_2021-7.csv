I'm making this post however because I could really use some advice for my specific situation. 

&#x200B;

I'll try to keep this as short as possible:

I started taking phenibut in a (reasonably healthy) 2g once every 3 day schedule, since I had done my research. It's fair to say I fell in love. 2 months in I got into a depressive episode, which made me not give a shit anymore and took it everyday for about a month. I got my shit together and decided for a week break. To my suprise I barely had any withdrawals. Knowing this made me careless and arrogant. 

I started again, this time on a 3g once every other day schedule, thinking i could get away with it (since I'm apparently relatively insensitive to the wd). Did this for about 5 months where I am now. And boy do I get wd this time (I have only tried skipping one day and had to take a benzo to keep my shit together). 

So in short: what would be the best way of tapering in my situation. Should I switch to 1.5g daily and taper from there? or keep it 3g once every other day and slowly taper? Should I go to my GP and get gabapentin? I know I'm not nearly as sensitive to the wd as most here seem to be so I'm going for a fairly quick taper.

Never experienced panic attacks before, have slight anxiety for almost half of my life, diagnosed with bipolar disorder type 2.

Took 1-2gr every 2-4 days for 1,5 months. Also prescribed lamictal 100mg a day and trittico 150mg for night. Consumed energy drinks.

 With tapering PHB started to also taper off caffeine, so for these six normal days I consumed one can instead of two. Near two weeks ago had started tapering, since I just fed up with that dont-give-a-crap mood which pheni provides.

 From two to one gram everything was alright. Three days.

From one to 750mg also alright. Three days.
For all that time only had constipation and gas in bowels.

From 750 to 500. Two days OK, and then I ve got something unexpected. 

At the late evening eventually i felt a little pain (like when gas is stuck in bowel for some time) in the appendix area (get these for pains frequently when bloated). Then i started to  fear that it’s appendicitis and i will go to operation (fearing surgical manipulations like hell). Then my hair started to shiver, blood raised to face, started feeling a lot of movement in bowels, like in diarrhea. And a very hard spasm in the upper digestive tract, nausea and was ready to barf. Also very hard heartbeat was present. Took trittico and lamictal as prescribed, smoked a cig. Felt lot easier after like an hour. Slept good.

The next day all the time i felt a little bit nauseous, constipation wore off. Started to drink half a can of energy drink a day. Took 500mg last time that day. Slept also good enough. There was no pain in right side of belly.

Then on the next day took 250mg. 0,5 can of ED. On the late evening eventually started to feel my hair shivering, nausea, bowel movements, heartbeat, blood rushing to face. 

That time it felt way more vegetative rather than physiological (bc there was no pain prior to) or psychological (because it was accompanied by anxiety and fear onle for first five minutes). Felt better after like half an hour.

Today also took 250mg, and a half of a can of ED. Had the same vegetative symptoms. Now with absence of any anxiety. Also lasted as little as 10 minutes or so.

So what the hell is this thing? That infamous glut surge?
Also in like three days i will start to take Zoloft instead of trittico (my psychiatrist prescribed me to replace it with zoloft on friday). Would zoloft help or will make it worse?

ED: trittico is sometimes used in BZD withdrawal treatment. 
ED2: I can’t do a normal or slow taper since my PHB is in capsule form, so it’s not possible to separately weigh 100 or 50mg of contents",4,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.49397743}"
2021-07-27 09:51:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/osn8aa/done_and_dusted/,Done and dusted,"Started taking Phenibut at the beginning of 2019, I used some guy's dosage guide from a blog. HE was taking it once a week about 2-3G, so that's what I did. I do have a bit of social anxiety and also an addictive personality, however I didn't feel the need to break this schedule and things went mostly fine throughout 2019 and first months of 2020. I also took some breaks when the stuff ran out, before ordering more, and did not have any withdrawals. Probably more subtle effects might have been occurring, on the off days, but nothing too noticeable.

Fast forward to end of 2020 and I enter a pretty tumultuous relationship and also renovate my apartment  (while also living in it ..not a nice experience). Needless to say, my anxiety probably went upward and also my sleep quality degraded (mostly from the relationship, and less from the renovation). So I end up taking more of the stuff, and in the off days i would get some 5-hour sleep nights, which initially I put on the stress, but not  the Pheni. I basically increased the dosage to 4 G, but still took it once a week and couple of days around NYE, I think I took it consecutively.

Finally went through the relationship break-up, and again had some bad nights sleep, at this point I started reading into Phenibut withdrawal, and took some Beta Alanine since I read it decreases tolerance. I stopped Phenibut for a week, after digesting the break up, and sleep quality increased. However, after that, I got the bright idea to take it twice a week, 1-1.5G. I used the scoop they provided in the package, and that in theory had 1G, but after measuring later, noticed it had about 1.2G, so that meant i was taking 1.4 - 1.7G twice a week.

Had another couple of nights of waking up at 4 AM at the end of March, probably linked to Phenibut, then things went mostly fine until one week in May, where I decide to take it 3 times a week. I had just started boxing training and was feeling a bit stressed during the actual training sessions, so I decided to take it Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, again around 1.7G per day.

The whole week I slept great, but next week hell broke loose. I didn't take it on Tuesday and started waking up at 4-5 AM. I ended up taking a larger dose , about 3G on Thursday and then maybe even more on Sunday, when I actually slept decent, but every other night, same shit, waking up at 5 AM, and increasing anxiety during the day. Amazingly, right around this time my EX contacted me again (just a bit of hoovering), and that probably sent me in full breakup rebound anxiety.

So, after this I had a trip to Viena, where I only took maybe 2G of Phenibut with me and also started reading more into this section, which obviously increased my anxiety (considering some of the horror stories). Eventually (and because I thought I can tough it out, since it wasn't a very high dosage), I decided to CT the stuff, while I was there in Vienna. I threw most of the Phenibut i had on me away, only took 0.4G for sleep one night. Probably had mild withdrawals for a week, I kept waking up at 4 AM with a cold sweat and had that rebound anxiety during the day, anhedonia. I was walking around Vienna with 10% sightseeing desires. Also I was a moron, because I read here that Taurine also helps withdrawal, but I took it as part of energy drinks and since the caffeine also fucks up with GABA receptors, that slowed down the healing process.

Still I was able to function properly, even went to a trail run obstacle event, one week later and did most of my training as expected (i usually run marathons and triathlons, so I do have quite a bit of training volume each day). Things were improving slightly, however I had 3 separate nights where I got some high anxiety and since I was afraid I wouldn't sleep ended up taking 0.5G and 1 G of Phenibut, because I still had 2 bags of home. This was in 3 separate weeks. After the third time, I decided this shit has to stop and threw away all of the Phenibut (100G +).

Went to a shrink, who didn't know anything about Phenibut and got some Trazodone for sleep (30 mg). Thank god, this helped my sleep, and pushed it towards 7h per nights initially. Also I started going to sleep earlier, around 10 PM to counter the 4-5 AM wake up. During this time I took, NAC, L Theanine, Taurine.

So for the last 2 weeks sleep quality has increased substantially, going towards 8hrs with more than 1 hour deep sleep. Also anxiety is almost gone, we'll have to see what happens when I stop the Trazodone, I'll probably do some nights on and off, as a test.

&#x200B;

Now, the good stuff. I also quit caffeine almost entirely during this time, and that in itself is good enough to increase sleep quality. You can check out some stories on Youtube of people who quit caffeine, and the benefits. I said I quit it almost entirely, because I will still drink coffee once a week, and if I have a race I take caffeine gels which really improve performance, but nowhere near 2 coffees and a red bull per day like before.

Dropped my alcohol consumption,  not that I was an alcoholic before, but I would have 4-5 beers if I went out with friends, or too much vodka if I went clubbing, and now it's 2 beers or 2 glasses of wine in social situations, at most.

Started doing regular Wim Hof breathing and some Yoga Nidra daily sessions which are pretty good at decreasing low level anxiety, by themselves. Also good for mindfulness in general

Actually the last time I took more that 3G of Phenibut, I booked a tandem skydive and at that point i was sure I could only go ahead with it , if I also took Phenibut on the day of the dive. Went there yesterday, and did the dive with no Phenibut. Obviously I was scared shitless at some points, but everything went fine (not that I had to do anything, i had a guy strapped to my back who knew when to open the parachute and stuff like that). 

So in general, although this semi CT might have caused some damage (hopefully not much), knowing what I went through in June, and how I had to grind it out each day and night, gives me a lot of self-confidence in situations, where I would probably have lacked it before.

Obviously I am not saying, CT is the way to go, especially since I was on a low dosage compared to to others, but the idea is, whatever tapering you're doing, keep at it, enjoy the small progress and know that at the end of the day, when you'll be off, you'll be a better person.

From April 17th-May 27th I used Phenibut just about daily from 250mg-17500mg per day, probably averaging around 750mg a day each time. Every time I took it I was mixing it with high doses of Vyvanse. At the time I was on Prozac and couldn't take MDMA, and I heard that Phenibut with speed feels sort of like a mild MDMA trip, so I was using this combo to compensate. Needless to say I went crazy with it and rabid tapered at the end of May.

Flash forward to now, 55 days of being off the Phenibut. I still feel messed up. Horrible anxiety, depression, dissociation. My situation is complicated though because I was on a ton of different drugs. Around this same time I had just stopped the Prozac (which I am now back on thankfully) and my psychiatrist pulled my Vyvanse prescription after he ended up finding out. I was put on Gabapentin to help deal with the anxiety but that, for some reason, only ended up making things worse for me, so I was forced to rapid taper off of that which was even worse than coming off the Phenibut.

The only thing that really helped the extreme anxiety were the benzos (Klonopin) I was giving and I am currently tapering off of that right now as well. My question though is...is it possible the Phenibut gave me permanent brain damage? Ever since then I have just felt f@cked mentally. I can't even function and I'm in an outpatient program right now.

Granted, I am tapering off benzos right now as well and I have horrid OCD that keeps telling me I am brain damaged permanently and need to kill myself. But when will this madness end? It can't just be the Phenibut causing all of this. I mean, I never went crazy with the dosing (never used more than 2 grams in one day) and I've been off for 55 days. I was even in the psych ward at one point for six days but that did not help me that much. While there I just came off the Gabapentin and was put on Prozac and benzos which did help stabilize me a bit.

What the heck is going on? I just feel like my brain is broken and I am f$cked. Its not so much anxiety I am getting now though (although I still get that a plenty), more so horrible depression. Will I ever feel normal again? I am hoping a lot of what I am feeling now is just coming off the Klonopin and is making my OCD flare up.

Still though, I f#cked up so bad by abusing speed and touching Phenibut. My OCD is trying to convince me right now that the Phenibut is the main of all this, that my brain is ruined, and the only solution is suicide. I know it probably is not that simple though since I am juggling five different drugs in this mix: Prozac, Adderall/Vyvanse, Phenibut, Gabapentin and Klonopin.",7,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.8033225}"

I binged 4 grams per day from mid June to mid July. On Wednesday last week I took my usual dose when I woke up, but it didn't eliminate my anxiety to a desirable level, so I took more and more and more, until I reached 3 grams. My highest dose ever. I'm not gonna lie the high was pretty insane, it felt just like an amphetamine high. But towards the end of it I started having the symptoms of what you call glutamate storms and panicked, so of course I reached for more phenibut because I thought it was supposed supress not cause anxiety (my fault for abusing it), and it only made it worse, I maybe took upwards of 6 grams that day? Suffice to say until Friday night I had 0 hours of sleep.

Friday morning I let my mom know what was happening, and went to a hospital. They did absolutely nothing, and the worst thing was that I had a flight the next day, this added so much anxiety to the whole situation. The doctors said they knew nothing about it and that it would be better to seek treatment in the country I'm flying to. I was having multiple anxiety attacks a day, I was petrified. Thankfully Friday night I was able to score enough benzos to put me to sleep and travel without losing my shit. I didn't take any phenibut with me. 

Phenibut hell is a very very scary place, you never know if you're in withdrawal or having a glutamate storm. At least that's what I thought. To anyone coming across this post experiencing the same symptoms STOP IMMEDIATELY, I felt so so much better when I completely stopped taking phenibut, if you hold out for 12-24 hours you'll see what I mean, but only do so if you're confident you won't suffer a seizure, in that case just taper. Take as long a break as you can physically withstand then dose when you feel the need to. 

Sunday afternoon on the way to the doctors appointment I had the first panic attack of my life, this one was so severe I realized the ones before were simply anxiety attacks. I was fully convinced I was having a seizure (I was not as the doctor pointed out they only last upwards of 2 mins while my panic attack lasted 10)

When I got to doctors I felt a massive wave of relief when he knew what phenibut was, he prescribed me gabapentin and mirtazapine for sleep. I got home and took the gabapentin... Instantly I had the worst glutamate storms of my life. I started panicking again, I realized I had to cold turkey. The doctor assured me I would be ok. But to those currently having glutamate storms when dosing, expect gabapentin to cause the same if not worse symptoms, I'm unsure about baclofen tho. 

Throughout this week, I've been able to sleep maybe 6 hours on average per day. I usually wake up feeling perfectly fine which baffles me, but 6 hours in to the day the glutamate surges start... Blurry vision, pressure in the head, a hot electrifying feeling in my face and upper body, pressure in the ear which makes it hard to hear, panicky/anxious feelings. The last 3 days were fine but today was particularly bad, this is so confusing. 

I don't mind the rebound anxiety I just hate the physical sensations of a ""glutamate storm"" I just want it to stop, the doctor doesn't know what to do. And since I'm in a 3rd world country I can't find l theanine or NAC or any of the remedies mentioned here. I even quit my caffeine habit, nothing's helping except the mirtazapine, it miraculously takes away all glutamate surge symptoms, but I can only take it before I sleep so I'm out of luck for the rest of day.

In my entire life I've never had self control issues this bad with a drug, no drug has ever caused me this much pain. To all the people who suffer with depression and anxiety, tread carefully. And those in phenibut hell, leave leave leave as soon as possible, it only gets worse, if you hold out just for 12-24 you'll feel like a king. 

TL;DR: Cold turkeyed a 3 week 4 gram per day habit on Friday and still having glutamate storms.

I mostly stayed at the once a week mark and did short binges and got off with bouts of insomnia. Almost 2 months ago, I got a job and have been taking it every day for work, basically 4 days on 3 days off or 3 days on 4 days off, sometimes less sometimes more. I've tried to keep my dosing low. For the most part I was taking 750-1g up until this past week where i went up to 2g, and 2.5g for a few days in a row.

My last dose was sunday morning which was a good day. Monday was an ok day. I got some decent sleep that night. Tuesday was a worse day and I slept for 2 hours last night. Today I have been freaking out and feel pretty bad. I have to go to work on friday, sunday and monday this week. I do not want to keep going through this vicious cycle but i'm afraid to go to work without it. The worst part is the insomnia but the anxiety is pretty severe too.

So right now im at 78 hours with no phenibut. Due to lack of sleep last night i feel pretty bad today even though i dont have to work or anything. I also took 50mg benadryl last night and it did nothing.

I'm wondering if I should toss the rest of the phenibut i have now and just try to go to work friday and power through it without any? Or should i take a small dose this friday for work and taper off over the weekend?

I've been using phenibut off and on for almost two years, and while it has sucked at times, I'm currently experiencing the worst panic of my life, and I'm wondering if it's related to the addition of baclofen (I got it to taper with, but I'm a moron and wasn't watching my doses.) Now, I've used baclofen at varying doses before, and as far as I can tell I've never withdrawn from it.

Now I'm out of baclofen, but theoretically shouldn't I be able to up my phenibut dosage to match where I was with the baclofen? Sort of like a reverse taper I guess. I know I'm a moron, and I am paying for it dearly. 

I need to believe there's a light at the end of this tunnel. I barely survived a suicide attempt a couple of years ago, and I sincerely don't want to die. I just feel like an animal backed into a corner.

I have no direct connection with people who take Phenibut and/or Kratom except on these subreddits. 

I’ve always been curious as to how you feel your use, or abuse of substances has effected your performance and income. Phenibut is unique in the sense that it boosts dopamine and limit inhibitory responses to the brain. Everyone here can tell stories of its effect on mood, pleasure, outgoingness. In the 5 years of my use I’ve changed professions and learned a new trade, since for the most part of my time in this trade I’ve taken Phenibut with Kratom I cannot say if I would have learned it faster, made less mistakes or if I would have done everything the exact same way than if I was 100% free from anything.

How do you feel Phenibut has hindered or helped your goals in life? Do you feel you are better off now or do you think you’d be better if you never tried it? 

We can’t always give Phenibut the gold medal, its your own passion and drive to perform that breaks barriers but Phenibut (and Kratom) helps sometimes with the struggle.",9,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6470738}"

Even kratom did nothing and I began having terrible RLS ( which I naturally have anyway) I want to post this in case it helps. Using this plan I was able to drop 500mg a day with almost no side effects ( 2-3 bad dreams total and a few days with no sex drive) please note Kratom was used because it did help ease and give some euphoria to stave off the total dissociation phenibut w/d gives

-Take 100mg of l-theanine 
-Take 2-300mg of Ashwaghandah
-Take 1.5-2g of Beta-Alinine

I also partook in a few drinks on the weekends this made my sleep muuuuch easier and I didn’t wake as much but just settle that you will have some bad dreams, and almost feel like you aren’t ‘sleeping’ or ‘dreaming’ but lucidly resting for a few days. Take control of it, think happy, go on an adventure in your mind. This subsided once I got down to 3g.

Once I realized it was glutamate issues I reduced to 12gpd and felt reduction in anxiety, and once again in May to 9gpd. 

For a bit at 9gpd I felt better stable but then I began to have strong mood swings between dosages. I didn’t know what to do, i assumed it was because my dose was too high and or phenibut turned on me and was making me depressed, I quickly tapered to 5.5gpd over two weeks with no reduction in my extremely low mood, but just an increase in anhedonia and anxiety. 

At this point I thought phenibut had turned on me so switching baclofen would help presumably, so 7 days ago I completely switched to 60mg of baclofen. 

It is day 7 of my baclofen switch and I am so ridiculously depressed, briefly in the morning my mood is neutral but by after noon I’m in this terrible dark state, where I just feel pure dispair, nothing makes me happy or distracts me, just dark thoughts with this pit in my stomach. The best way I can describe how it feels is it feels like the love of your life dumped you, but it’s just a never ending cycle of that feeling.

It’s day three and my mood swings have been crazy. Anxiety hasn’t been too bad but my mood is all over the place. This morning I felt the best I have in months on top of the world. And as the evening came I fell into a crazy deep world ending depression. 
Is this normal for a baclofen switch? Will my mood and depression stabilize? After all it’s only day three.  Andy insight would be great.",5,{},"{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.4946691}"

I would always change my dose from day to day usually staying between 1.5g-2.5g in both the morning and the evening for a total of 3g-5g. Things were going well for the first 4 months and I was able to stop for a day or two without many unpleasant side effects.

About 2 months ago I started having problems. I would dose and then become crazy manic and pace all day and smoke 2 packs of cigarettes to try and calm my nerves. This would happen whether I took 1g or 5g. Thinking I was withdrawing the whole time I increased up to 7g thinking it would calm me down only for it to make it worse. 

After trying to figure out what was going on and trying stabilize my dose while also taking it all at once instead of staggered I started scouring the phenibut subs on reddit. It was then that I realized I was experiencing a pretty much non stop glutamate surge. So I read about ways to stop the surges and saw that some people had success with not dosing for 24-48 hours. So I skipped my dose the next morning and waited to about the 40 hour mark when the withdrawals really started kicking in. This fixed the surges but now I can't get out of what I would consider minor withdrawal symptoms. Mostly some depression, a little anxiety, and some trouble sleeping. However I've been taking 7gpd in the morning for the last 3 days and hoping I can somewhat stabilize on this dose so I can begin to taper.

I have both baclofen and gabapentin on the way and was wondering if I should use both or just the baclofen as I've read that is more effective with the withdrawal symptoms. Also should I use them and taper down from my dose at the same time or just jump off and use those to manage symptoms?

I have 152 days (5 months) off Phenibut, Fentanyl, and Flualprazolam!","Hey everyone, I haven’t been on Reddit in while now. For some reason after getting clean, I just kind of stopped coming on here. And I used to be on here all day every day posting and commenting and learning!

I hope everybody is doing well. After 5 months I can assure you guys, I am feeling great! My anxiety and depression is lower than it’s been in probably 9 years since before I started using anything! 

Fire reference, I was using 4g of phenibut a day but was like 7-9g at my highest for over 2 years. I would taper down low to .5g then relapse back up to 3g and have to restart. I was using gabapentin to get myself down but ended up addicted to that to and had to quit. I was sniffing 3-4 Mbox 30s a day that were pressed with fentanyl and hit hard. I did that for around my last 6 months using as they felt so good l just couldn’t stop. Finally, the Flualprazolam. I was using 2-4mg of that shit a day pressed into hulks that my “buddy” was getting from the dark web and would just special order them for me because he would just get the regular x2s pressed with whatever.

My life was an absolute MESS while addicted to all of that. I was functioning but it was awful. $600 a week down the drain just spent on drugs. I would leave work sometimes to go pick up the percs if I would run out. Absolutely no one knew and I was able to play everything off easy because I would keep everything down low. Eventually I just came to a breaking point and couldn’t take it anymore because I couldn’t get high off the fent, I would sniff 4 at a time and not feel anything but would sometimes nod out but it wasn’t a good feeling. I always felt like I was in withdrawal, I was an anxious depressed mess inside. Eventually I just came clean to my mother who was upset, but super understanding as she knew I was struggling with anxiety badly but didn’t know the extent. She just wanted to help me.

We set up a detox and a program after and off I went. The detox claimed they knew what phenibut was but they lied and when I got there they had no clue what I was talking about. They gave me a suboxone taper and a Valium taper from 40mg decreasing 5mg a day. It wasn’t nearly enough and they wouldn’t listen or care about anything I said and I ended up having 2 seizures which I was always scared of the most. They would shoot me with Ativan and I would slowly come out of the seizure with a major headache confused as to what the fuck was going on. But it wasn’t as bad as I thought a seizure would be which is what I was always scared of what would happen. I was just hanging out in the common room feeling weird then it would happen and I would come out of it. There really was no warning for when they would come. Luckily they were not grand mal seizures and I made it out okay. Rehab was good for me. I was just in a big house with a group of good guys and we would go to groups for 6 hours a day then back to the house and would just hang out and chill and watch tv and play darts lol. I got out after a month and have not looked back.

Anyway, I apologize for this giant wall of text. How is everybody doing? How are you guys holding up?? It’s been long since I’ve been here, does anybody remember me? Either way, if you have any questions please feel free to ask! I’m going to try to stick by this sun again more often and help people out.

I never made a huge habit of it until covid hit, then my use went up too twice a week. One day I took phenibut under the tongue and immediately was hit with paradoxal effects (Increased heartrate, extreme anxiety, panic attack) After that I quit phenibut for about a month and deemed it safe to come back. I was fine for a few months doing it twice a week at pretty small dosages (500-750mg). I noticed my mental health began to fall apart and took a few weeks off. I repeated that cycle again and have noticed my mental health pretty much disintegrate (I have diagnosed OCD) in the past few months, while cutting phenibut back down to once a week. I also have noticed my sleep has been garbage.

I am unsure if this due to phenibut??? Like is the consistent use really frying my gaba that bad? even if it is only 1gram a week. I want to take some again this week for relief but I'm afraid this drug might have to leave my life for good. I'm pretty exhausted at this point; I love how this stuff makes me feel when I'm on it but the time off of it... is just not worth it.

Its been a week since I took my last dose and I still feel pretty anxious and unstable but it feels like it's kind of improving. Im also working out, good diet, and meditating a ton.

A couple weekends I’ll take a booster dose the day after. Anyways I really didn’t notice feeling down too much after. Just sort of out of it for a couple 3 days. But fast forward to now. I noticed that I was having to increase my dosage to get the effects I wanted. Last Saturday I did probably close to 5g. Started off with 3, and spread the other two out over about a 3 hr span. Anyways the next day had a huge after glow. Probably because I took it Saturday night and it was still in my system pretty much. 

But fast forward to Sunday night I felt nausea and couldn’t stop puking for a day straight, then Monday night hit and I got hit with this wave of anxiety and impending doom. Everything also just felt very off, like it felt like it was the 8th day of the week if that’s makes sense. I was super foggy, my body was also really sore as well. Legs hurt, arms hurt, etc. Felt the same on Tuesday just more depressed, which caused me anxiety for depressed I was. Then 

Wednesday hit. Felt somewhat better. But still not great. Tried some THC later that night, gave me a massive anxiety attack, which this type of weed has never done before. It was so bad that I woke up with having a full blown panic attack in the middle of the night- even though I hadn’t smoked since almost 7 hrs prior. Anyways I am on Thursday and feeling somewhat better still somewhat out of it. I guess my question is, is this like a normal thing to happen after using large doses of phenibut only on the weekends and just for a month? I get people say you can use once a week for a long time with no issues. But maybe everyone is different. Or could it be something else. 

Also I did end up throwing away the rest because I figured it was the only thing that could cause it. Any answers would be great, thanks!",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.49675605}"

It was the darkest time of my life but it was so worth it.,"Hello guys, this is my first post. im 19 years old and didn't even know that there were withdrawals like that. I went on vacation and told me, fuck it I am taking a tolerance break and after 3 days I've got my first panic attack. extreme, like unbelievably extreme anxiety, horrible depression, my shoulder twitched all the time, extremely depersonalized and dissociated, extreme paranoia and delusional thinking, and at day 7 (the day where I got in psychiatry for 4 days), literally psychosis and hallucinations (I saw a women with a dress in my hallway and the face of my mum moved and she looked like slender man or something) we sat outside and It was dark outside so this doesn't made It any better. because I also didn't know what was going, I never once thought it was because of kratom and especially phenibut. my mum and my sister told me all the time that it was because of these substances. then I saw them hidden in a basket and I got extremely aggressive and took them and said if I couldn't take them now I will kill myself. (im an very happy person normally) because I live in Austria nobody knows these substances so they didn't believe me when I screamed that I need to taper. I can't this describe how horrible this evening was. really, I never even nearly had anything similar to this.

Now it is around 24 days later and im much much better. im extremely emotional now and I lost confidence that I normally (even without phen and kratom) I would have. I have no desire to party and normally im very extroverted and looove to party and meet girls and all that. I have extremely good moments even better than ever on then and kratom but this melancholy and slight depression creeps back. I want my intrinsic motivation to do things and party and just life and full enjoy life again. and right now should be the best time of my life (summer after ending school) this also stresses me out. I know the crying is healing and I feel 1000000x better after it but I wanted to ask if this extremely melancholy feeling will pass. The best thing now is that I can deeply feel my emotions again and this just feels great!

Two years ago I had gotten addicted to it, but I managed to quit it with a slow taper without any real side effects.  This time around, I didn't realize I had become addicted to it again.  I was also on Wellbutrin and using medicinal marijuana to go to sleep.  I don't remember the cirumstances, but I got terrible insomnia for two nights in a row and went to the doctor, not even thinking phenibut could be the problem.  They prescribed me 2x 15mg temazepam and told me to take it for a week and then taper off.  The first night I took one, it didn't work, then I took diphenhydramine, it didn't work, then I took another temazepam and some phenibut and eventually fell asleep for a few hours.  The next day I took 30mg temazepam and what must have been like 2 to 3g of phenibut in the somatomax like 12 hours later.  I think that started off the shit show.  After realizing I was addicted to the phenibut, I stayed on the temazepam for 3 weeks.  For the next couple of weeks, I got off the Wellbutrin, and I started taking 2g of phenibut, then cut down to 1g a night.  One night I really fucked up and took 30mg temazepam and then 5 hours later took another 30mg. After those couple of weeks, I realized that I'm pretty screwed so I cut down to 15 mg temazepam for a couple of nights and switched over to 3mg Lunesta.  All while doing 1g of Phenibut.

Fast forward a month and a half later, I cut the Lunesta to 3/4 for a week - and went through incredible vertigo and nausea withdrawal - and dropped the phenibut down to 700mg.  Then I cut the Lunesta down to 1/2 of a pill for a week.  And then last week I stopped Lunesta completely.  I've been attempting 625 to 650mg of phenibut a night with little success.  I've got really bad insomnia.  Some nights I can sleep for 3 or 4 hours, but those are rarely.  Last night I didn't sleep at all.  I'm not sure what to do next.  My doctor is at a loss.  I'm fairly sure I was addicted to the benzos because the withdrawal was horrific.  And then I think I got addicted to the Lunesta.  I assume I'm still withdrawing from that.

Trying to reduce the dose at the 1hr 45min mark. Currently at 39mg. :/ This is hopeless

For reference, I was using Baclofen at a rate of 250mg p/ day (25g Phenibut) for over 12 months.

During the past month, this disgustingly had risen to ~400mg p/ day (~40g Phenibut), attempting to balance the glutamate storms (which mimic withdrawal symptoms) and trying to stabilise at a dose and still be functional.

My doses previously were every two hours. This was reduced to every 1 hour 30 minutes, as it was the only method in ridding myself of these symptoms.

I’ve since been increasing the timeframe between doses by 5 minutes p/ dose whenever I felt I could handle it.

I’m currently at 1 hour 45 minutes; two days ago, I attempted to go to 1 hour 50 minutes. However, I experienced pretty severe withdrawal symptoms (or Glutamate surges), which became apparent the following afternoon.

I’m currently using Lamotrigine and Memantine to balance/reverse the high Glutamate levels that I’ve experienced.

Lamotrigine - 100mg each morning

Memantine - 40mg each night

My question is: shall I attempt a rapid taper? And if so, what would be the best approach, continuing to increase the timeframe between doses or reducing the amount used per dose?

Could I honestly cut my dose in half and still be okay? 

Memantine restores homeostasis within the glutamatergic system. Therefore, I’m hoping that with continuing my schedule, at some point, these issues will cease existing.

However, a symptom of withdrawing from Baclofen/Phenibut are insane levels of Glutamate. If Memantine is protecting me from this, would dropping quickly be feasible?

I am now down to 330mg 3x a day (from 800mg-1g 3x a day), which was my benchmark for when I wanted to start quitting. This means I’m right under 1g total a day! 

I could easily go straight to Baclofen and be done with this in a week (and I have plenty), but I think I’m just going to continue with my taper. Everything has been going so smoothly, I don’t really feel there’s a need to throw off the equilibrium.

I’m telling you guys, slow and steady won the race for me. I drop 30 milligrams 4x a week: Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. I never notice ANYTHING as far as withdrawals during my drops, although my first taper attempt I failed when I was dropping 30mg daily; so as you can see, my body is very reluctant to change.

However, dropping 4 days out of the week seemed to fix that for me. I’ve been sleeping well, mood has been good and overall, I’ve not noticed any difference in my sleep patterns.

Some supplements that have helped me GREATLY is Jarrows B Right (a B complex vitamin for energy and motivation), Magnesium Threonate (for cognition and brain fog), and Black Seed Oil (for mood and a little bit of motivation and energy combined).

I believe these three supplements will help even without Phenibut as they have tremendously been a cornerstone in my well being and me being able to be a diligent worker and have motivation and drive outside of work. I would encourage anyone to check these out.

Warning: 
Withdrawal symptoms may not be experienced for up to 72 hours after going cold turkey or drastically decreasing your dose. Always assume you need to taper after daily use. Experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms may affect your rational judgement. 


Taper references

Slow taper: decreasing 0-50 mg per day

Normal taper: decreasing 50-100 mg per day

Fast taper: decreasing 100+ mg per day

Fast tapering should usually be avoided, especially if you experience panic attacks, seizures, severe agitation, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis, insomnia, severe lethargy, depression, muscle jerking,     tremors, tachycardia or hyperthermia. 

Note that the overall consensus from people who have tapered is that decreasing 50 mg every 2-3 days until stabilized at that dose seems to work well. 

Please see a doctor if you are experiencing a medical emergency and do not use this sub as a substitute for medical help or rehabilitation if needed. If you are having issues controlling yourself during your taper and are upping your dose to try and control withdrawal symptoms, people on Reddit won’t be able to help you. A good place for someone who is not able to taper themselves to go would be your personal care provider or a psychiatrist, who may be able to help with prescribed meds. A place to go if you are having a medical emergency would be an emergency room at your local hospital. Here is a link to a study where baclofen was used to treat phenibut withdrawal, bring it with you if you seek medical treatment.

I got serious about tapering probably a total of 10 times before I actually started doing it. I got all the way down to 4gpd and had a seizure (don’t let this scare you I was dumb and tapered waaay to fast).

Ordered baclofen (not enough) after my seizure and held at 4gpd until I saw my neurologist last week. I brought in a case study and she was very understanding and sweet but felt uncomfortable since she had no clue what phenibut is. She put me on a seizure med because I told her I’m still going to try to taper. 

I ordered enough baclofen to switch at 1g and have a comfortable taper off of that. It will be here in about 3 weeks judging on my last orders shipping. 

So right now I’m at 3gpd + 1 10mg baclofen. 
I’m pretty comfortable at the moment and I’ve held at this dose for 4 days. My plan is to taper off the baclofen in a few days and then hold at 3gpd for a week then add in another 10mg baclofen and drop to 2g and so on. Once I taper off the last 10mg and am at 1gpd my order will be here and I can just jump straight to the baclofen. 

From what I’ve heard I might have to supplement 25mg baclofen for that 1g phen when I switch but ive ordered enough to make sure I can do that. I hope to be completely off phen hopefully end of august at the latest.

I've been wondering, why do people who want to quit this devil drug keep using it, even while tapering, when it has pronounced against ADHD/dopaminergic effects?

It literally makes you feel like on amphetamines while being low on GABA all the time, prolonging the agony. My doctor said it's an ADHD medicine afterall..

&#x200B;

Been there, quit cold turkey using Valium for 9 days, stopped Valium without any rebounds or withdrawals. It got so easier this way.

I understand people might be tired and/or paranoid and don't want to swap to another addiction, but benzos are RX only and are very safe for short amount of time. Diazepam is like the first choice med here in Europe for detoxification from any harder drugs.

&#x200B;

Let me know what do you think guys! Personally I couldn't taper anymore because I got so paranoid, anxious, overstimulated. had tremors and panic attacks just after decreasing the dosage by 500mg(1 pill).

Now, a little over year afterwards I feel great but I've got shivers as soon as I think about my phenibut experience and rebounds.. and I've withdrawn from many drugs - phenibut was absolutely the worst.

But I had dry mouth, needed some water but I immediately spat it out as the water tasted bad grabbing the wrong drink. Losing enough of my dose that the water was quite cloudy white.


For context, I've been taking phenibut since november 2019, I use to take it every other day 1.5g. But I started to feel terrible on my off days, so I began to taper taking it daily in september 2020, accidentally doubling my dose to 2.3g and it was now gpd than every other day. Since then I've been quite slow with my tapering due to reduction fear/irrational thoughts, where I made progress, but slow progress. I'm currently at 1.300gpd as of july 2021.

But back on topic; after fearing the worst when I noticed I spat out a lot of my dose yesterday. I actually felt quite normal. The people here were also extremely reassuring and helpful with the anxiety and prevented me from taking more. I then later last night I'm not even sure if I took my second dose or if I did, if it was even the full dose, as I felt quite tired last night.


Just thinking about it, when I spat it out yesterday, that could've been 100-200mg I spat out. 

Is this a perfect sign that I should probably increase my taper speed from 20mg-50mg or so every week to 50-100mg every 3 days?

As I actually slept last night, didn't have much anxiety after spitting out my dose. Am I seeing the end of this hellish phenibut tunnel? 


Also if you made it this far,  I thank you for reading this, as I just wanted to get it off my mind, and encourage my self. But I also have a side question.


Is it even worth tryin to get on baclofen to switch to at such a dose, 1.3g?

I'd been given gabapentin 300mg for sleep by my primary, but it barely dented my issue.  Best I'd get was 6-7 interrupted hours of sleep.  I tried adding 1g or less of phenibut for a week (our AC couldn't keep things comfortable).  It helped, but the effect diminished every day or two.

I also had to break with a long-time girlfriend/fiancé (although I regretted that and she even lost the ring) about a week afterwards when she finally answered the phone blaming a drunken/cocaine/xanax-induced blackout/haze. She was good enough to stalk my social media accounts during that time and say ""So I see you've been talking to X, Y, and Z!"" based on people who had replied to my posts. I wasn’t planning to cheat on her - I just feared my life was coming to an end and sincerely desired some connection/comfort/to reconnect with...anyone I could talk to.

Anyway...I'm tapered down to 1.75-2GPD, along with my usual meds (diazepam, gabapentin, baclofen, in slightly increased quantities on the days that I drop by 250mg - and I have someone else dispensing my meds to me) along with agmatine.

Supply ran out about 6 days ago, but had some leftover valium from a short term perscription a few years ago, which ran out day before last. I've gotten the money up to get another months supply of phenibut now, but running out was my own fault due to neglecting to buy more, so I'm not boohooing about it too hard, but looking at ways to temporarily solve this problem.

Yesterday I felt a bit more jacked up than usual - today I can't cool down, can't focus on anything, couldn't sleep for shit last night and my various mental health issues are being relentless today, though I'll spare you all the details because those are my own battle. Pouring with sweat, literally sopping, and have this weird bugs crawling on my skin type feeling which is worrying me because I know that could be called a sign of encroaching psychosis.

And this after TWO. DAYS. I have immense respect for people who have been able to kick this because to say this one feels tricky is an understatement. My refill probably won't be here until tomorrow at best, wednesday at worst, and I'm going to be honest these feelings are a bit alarming to me. I'll admit right now it's unpleasant but manageable... For now. We'll see what the next two days bring if I'm not lucky tomorrow morning or the next day.

All I have left right now is a steady supply of beers.
Had a can just now and some of the physical and emotional tension has left, though I feel like crap, just less so. Will the beers keep me good until my phenibut arrives or? If so, how should I space them out until then? If not, tips?

Any help would be dearly appreciated. Peace.",3,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.6754648}"

Before i found phenibut, i used to be socially anxious by the age of 15, and it grew more from a few really bad experiences at the age of 15-16 in social situations. By the time i was 16, i was doing fine with social anxiety and it got better, but something happend **(dont want to go into details rn im tired)** and it got worse. So much worse i didnt go to school, and i was inactive for 1.5 years just playing games, hanging out with friends. I also started smoking weed a lot and got very depressed over time until i was some what suicidal. I didnt want to kill myself, but at some point when it was low i didnt want to live in this world anymore. But it got better, as i went to psychiatrist and started up opening up and accepting my worst problems. It got better from there, and i started feeling more happy over time, my social anxiety got better too but still to the point where i couldnt speak my mind freely, as i worried about other opinions, and couldnt go out to grocery stores etc, only if it was night.

&#x200B;

Then after 2 years when i was 19, i was going to start in a new school. I was really nervous, as ive always been because my social anxiety have held me back before. So i had read something about this thing called Phenibut, as at that time i was still interested in drugs and was curious about other solutions. I had researched everything about Phenibut, so i knew what i was going into and how much to do, the rules for dosing, intervals etc. Ill cut the story short so it isnt going to be forever. Phenibut helped me so much, i started doing only 2 times a week. Monday and Wednesday. Those 2 times every week, i could social again, talking to people and not worrying constantly about what other people think, and when i walk around outside where to look when people go towards me etc.. It helped me be anxiety free, or with minimal anxiety ofc so i knew my inhibtions. I have growed a lot these past 2 years doing Phenibut, and ive gotten a girlfriend, a new apartment, a job, and a lot of new friends. But im just so tired, ive started taking phenibut 2-3x a week for 4 months, and again now the same intervals. But before i used to take 4x a week, for 2 months. My doses are really high too, 20g to 40g sometimes when i want to feel some what of the ""magic"" again. But lately, the past 1-2 weeks, i feel like im getting brain dead, i feel like i lost some iq, or my intellect because i cant think right anymore. If i have to do some calculations or other things related to thinking literal, i cant and i feel fucking stupid. I feel tired too in my brain. I have very short term memory too, like i got alheimers. People can tell me something, or my girlfriend and i wont remember the next day. I cant really remember what happens the day before and i cant remember at all what we talked about in conversations or important things so i forget almost everything so fast. 

Its not worth it at all for me anymore. I just feel so far, distanced in my mind and brain from what i was just a few months ago. Ive drained myself too much for the cause of anxiety, and i want to taper down and if possible find a new and better solution. And id never go to this point of my life again of this type of thing, as i underestimated an addiction, more because of the withdrawal effects and feeling like not myself anymore. Its just wierd and bad. I want to taper down for real, but i also dont want to feel the withdrawal effects or bad anxiety, as i still have to go to work,  and do things everyday as i live in my own apartment too. Ive read about fasoracetam lately, as ive just read through /quittingphenibut, as it looks like medicin that can take me off phenibut without anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. As im speaking, i need to take phenibut every 2nd day, and it has to be 14-16g",5,{},"{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.4483282}"

2021-07-03 17:52:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/od76e8/starting_my_journey_off_of_4_grams_fphenibut_per/,Starting my journey off of 4 grams F-Phenibut per day. For real this time.,Hey guys I have never posted in here but I have been reading your stuff for months. You have been a great resource to me and twice before I tried to cut out the F-Phenibut demon from my life. Two main reasons are driving this decision. 1) a 10 gram jar of f phenibut is 59$ so this has become almost 30$ a day and 2) I am at the point where I need too much to just be able to sleep and I value my job too much to continually go in on 3-4 hours of sleep. I started taking phenibut because I was put on Drug Court in my Minnesota hometown. After kicking the hard drugs I had a very anxious hole in my life where socializing seemed debilitating. I read up on phenibut many times over the last few years and knew I could evade urine tests with it. My vendor includes a 50mg scoop and at first it was 3 scoops per day. It helped my anxiety a lot and made it fun to talk to people. In the months that followed a tolerance developed and I hit a two month stretch where I had unbearable insomnia and didn't connect the dots. I was at about 6 heaping scoops per day at this point and taking 2 heaping scoops allowed me to sleep again (for a while). Tolerance kept on going and I needed to feel that joy of social interaction so I had to keep chasing it. A few days ago I was on about 20 heaping scoops in the AM and 25 just to sleep but I noticed 25 isn't enough to sleep anymore. I tried quitting cold turkey twice before by just not ordering any more and reading your guys stories while in psychosis just sent me straight into hell. Had to call into work which makes me very unhappy because I take pride in my work ethic. I placed an order too late last time and had to go without for 2 days and I don't think I've seen this mentioned on here before- Magnesium supplements along with my clonidine kept me sane and not having hallucinations. Nevertheless I started crying my eyes out after looking at this board on lunch and had to take 15 mins in the bathroom trying to get myself together. I don't know how it got to this point and I absolutely hate it. I have accepted that I have to be ok with my pre-phenibut anxiety coming back and I am ok with this. I get a nice script of gabapentin monthly that I usually abuse that I will now use to aid my taper. Drug Court can sanction me for seeking out a doctor other than the one they know about and the one I have tells them everything. It could be risky but baclofen could make it much easier. I could get sent to prison if they find out about this habit. If going by psychonaut then my dose would be comparable to 16-17g normal phenibut. So here I go boys I'm gonna conquer this beast this is the final big bad boss of my recovery and it's gonna be a hell of a lot harder than the other drugs.,1,{},"{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.4208541}"
2021-07-03 15:36:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingphenibut/comments/od4smi/and_so_the_nightmares_begin/,"And so, the nightmares begin...","I'm tapering from about 2 grams, currently at 1 gram. Last night, the nightmares started. I rarely dream nowadays except for when I take naps for some reason. Last night I had 5 dreams, two of them being nightmares. After each I would wake up sweating and exhausted. Not thinking about it, I had a few beers last night too so maybe that was part of the problem as well. 

The first nightmare was the shortest dream I've ever had. I fell asleep, then in the dream, I wake up in a hospital bed not being able to breathe. They put a oxygen mask on me but it didn't work. I laid there gasping for air, everything slowly going black, until I died. 

The second, I was at a festival playing with these strange metal fittings. Don't ask my why I was playing with metal fittings because I have no idea. I find this lose metal thread leftover from the machining process. I start to pull on it. All of a sudden, the fittings started to unravel and shred like spinning fireworks being lit and exploding. Over and over I played with these fittings as they spun, unraveled, and exploded in my hands, all the while huge metal shards went into my skin and of all places, my mouth and tongue. After this was all over, I began to slowly pull out these large pieces of metal embedded in my tongue. With each new shard I feel the rush of blood increase in my mouth. People all around me just stood and stared. I'm not one to call 911 or ask for help but at this point I was terrified. I tried to yell for help but couldn't because of the rush of blood filling my mouth.  I woke with a start, the taste of copper in my mouth, checking my tongue, sweating, and in a panic. This was almost worse than my worst nightmare from my last quit. 

In that one incorporeal alien demons were drilling into my brain and injecting me with tiny demons that would roll around in my head and behind my eyes. Along with the psychosis, it took me months to get over this one. It blended into my already severe psychosis and my mind thought it was real and that I was now demon possessed and bound for hell. 

Again, why didn't I learn my lesson the last 2 times? Phenibut makes me feel, well, more like myself than I've ever felt, when it works. Once it stops and I want to get off, it flips my world upside down, like a child playing with a snow globe. Anyone reading this, thinking about trying phenibut, don't. Don't even try using it responsibly. Just don't. You'll regret the day you were born and pray for death at some points.
